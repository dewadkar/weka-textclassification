            This camera does lots of things, Well what types of things you might ask?
good question, if you buy a special link, you can put your pictures onto your camera.  Now don't worry, because I'm &quot;computer Illiterate&quot;  so i have my son help me with anything that is computer related!  But this is so simple that he didn't even need to help me!  Its simple it plugs into the rear, base of the camera, you then plug the opposite part of the given plug into your A drive also known as the &quot;A:&quot;, or the Floppy disk Drive.  Then you go to MY COMPUTER then click &quot;A:&quot; then view your pictures! It's that simple! This camera only costs 270 dollars, which is a lot, but for that much you couldn't find another digital camera that has a zoom, so why not just get this one? Well i haven't had any problems with mine so far!
