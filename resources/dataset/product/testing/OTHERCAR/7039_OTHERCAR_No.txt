            I have owned many many Sony products- including 8 of their digital cameras (3 of which were returned to the store and forgotten about). I thought that the longer I wait, the better the camera will be. I thought they would have enough time to perfect things to out perform a 2 year older camera. I was wrong. The P10 is a disappointment in only one area, but it is the main area of a digital camera, and that is: The quality of the pictures. 

Imagine a once in a life time shot...a second in time you were hoping to capture and be able to look back and reminisce. Now imagine that same second in time coming out so blurry you can't recognize the faces of the ones you loved, or that once in a lifetime moment we talked about. This has been my experience with the P10 on 80% of the pictures taken.

The included 32mb memory stick is much too small for a 5mp camera. Luckily for a mere $100 you can upgrade to a 256mb stick :rollseyes:. Sony is literally financially raping the consumers. 

The metal casing on this camera is very nice. Nice to hold and nice to look at. As far as protection goes, it is as good as any. Once a digital camera is dropped it is never the same, there will always be something that doesn't operate to it's full potential..(i.e.-flash, lens, lcd, things of this sort). I would hope that nobody allows their cameras to be carelessly tossed about.

The battery life was not praise worthy whatsoever. After a measly 30 shots (no flash) the battery sign started flashing and after about 10sec of that it turned off. Back to the charger it goes for 2-3 hours. Thanks Sony.

I would not wish this camera on anyone. For now I will stick with my trust worthy 2 year old DSC-P3. Sure it is only 2.8 effective mega-pixels, but it would be better for me to have a fine 5x7 of that once in a lifetime shot rather than a 8x10 of a fuzzy memory.

I know Sony makes some good products, and that is why I continue to test/evaluate many of the Sony cameras that come out. In short, these are the ones I will forever stay away from: dsc-p5, dsc-p9, dsc-p10.
I like these: dsc-s50, dsc-p50,51,70,71 dsc-p32 (dumb flash though), dsc-p3, dsc-p7.

The P10 was returned to Circuit City after 2 weeks of use for a full refund. Try again Sony.
