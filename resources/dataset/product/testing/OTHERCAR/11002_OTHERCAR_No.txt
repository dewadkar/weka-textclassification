            Don't buy this van used.  Just don't, or you will be sorry.  This is a one-owner vehicle and does not hold up long enough for someone to buy it used.  Further, although GM advertises it as the van for &quot;childhood&quot;, it is very car seat UN-friendly.  I had to have a state trooper install the carseat and she said it was insane the way the seats and seatbelts were configured.  The rear oil seal will go on you at about 50,000 miles and GMC has issued a recall on the anti lock break system and as of this date done nothing.  I paid for anti lock breaks and the system has been out for almost a year.  I can't afford to have it fixed and GM is still stockpiling the computer chips for whatever reason.  Every time I call the dealer, I get the same info. . .&quot;we are waiting on GM to tell us what to do&quot;.  Go for a full size Toyota, and if you have kids, get the king cab, stay away from the Astro.<br><br>
