             Recently we went looking for price ideas for a new car.  We loved the Saturn 3 door.  It's sporty, yet economical.  We loved Saturns safety features on all their cars.  Scratch proof paint, dent resistant panels.  The engine that will roll down allowing the car to go over it in an accident.  We also love the good gas mileage and fairly big trunk space for a sports car.  All in all, Saturn makes great cars, but they claim to be a different kind of company.  They are just another car dealer.  
 When we went in there looking for prices and ideas.  We were waiting for a company contract to be resolved so we could have adequate money to put down.  When we walked on the lot we explained to the salesman we were looking for prices and wanted to look at the cars.  We spent the first hour hearing about the Saturn 3 door and taking it for a test drive.  Needless to say we loved the car, but weren't ready to buy at that point.  The salesman like any other used car dealer, not a different kind of dealer, ran us through financing, used cars, to begging family for a down-payment.  Six hours later, we drove off the lot with a used sports car that was not a Saturn. No we weren't stupid we didn't buy it.  We went home to show it to family and beg for the down payment, that we told them in the first place we wouldn't have for a few months.  The next day we took the car back.  We told them &quot;No Deal&quot; and maybe we'd be back when we had the money for the down payment.  When we do get the money maybe we will buy a Saturn, but not from this dealership.  Just proves the point that I'd rather get a root canal, major surgery, or go through child birth, then to buy a car from a salesman.<br><br>
