             I just recently purchased the 2001 Saturn SC1 3 door Coupe. In the 3 weeks I've owned the car, it's proven to be as good gripping the road as my old Subaru, maybe even better, since it's rained almost every day since I drove it home from the dealership. I commute to and from work and the driving consists of two major highways and a couple of state routes. One of the highways I take is notorious for its poor drainage during rain storms, and usually has mile long puddles on each side of the 2 lane parkway, making driving a little dangerous at almost any speed. With really no other choice, I brave the wind, rain and puddles, and get to and from work each day without any kind of fear that the wheel is going to be ripped from my hands after going through one of these &quot;hazards&quot;. Of course it helps to have experience driving in torrential downpours and the like (which I have done quite often), but having a car that can hold the road is also a big help. Not only does it grip the road well, but it drives just as smooth. 
 The inside has a stock radio with CD Player, which was a big plus for me. Being one who has the radio on from the moment I start the car to the moment I turn it off, I wanted something that could take the punishment of metal, alternative and freestyle, then still keep up when I &quot;go Country&quot;. So far, so very good. 
 The seats are comfortable, with more than adequate space for the driver and front passenger. The back is a little tight, and only seats two instead of three, since cup holders take the place of that middle part of the seat where all the short people seem to get stuck in other cars. If there's one thing that Saturn is not slacking on, it's cup holders. There's two in the back, and two up front (located on the console between the driver and passenger seat). 
 Now on to that third door. This was also a really big plus for me since I never really cart people around, but usually have something to throw in back on the driver's side (such as my art portfolio). Since I don't really use the passenger side, this mini door on the driver's side made things a little easier. 
 As for the engine: it's a 4 cylinder, with a little more juice than the SL1, but less than the SC2. Pickup isn't bad, could be a little faster, but in all, I get to 65 quickly. 
 The only drawback I have experienced is the fact that I can't see over my left shoulder when I turn to check my blind spot out the window. It's mainly because of the position of the seatbelt. It blocks part of the window. So, I have repositioned the driver's side mirror, and so far this has worked.
 Cost: For 14,000 I got a really dependable car that I enjoy driving. The people at the dealership were very friendly and one of the guys who sold my mother her car last year remembered me, her, where we worked and inquired about both places and how we were doing. I wasn't pressured into anything, got fast and friendly service, and best of all, quite a nice deal on my Subaru when I traded it in. 
 If you're looking for a new car, don't pass by Saturn. At least give one of their vehicles a test drive. You'll be as surprised as I was, I'm sure. <br><br>
