            Great looking car but the reason that the Service Dept is like a family is because I get to see them so often.
I  have had 2 major transmission jobs to find a whine that was caused from a bad bearing  inside the transmission, exhaust replaced twice, the weld let go and than it was reinstalled wrong, timing chain wore out at 36,000,weather stripping on 3 Doors, radio problems, Dome Light hangs down, heat temp sensor keeps lighting up they tell me this is a common problem, fuel temp sensor went at 42,000 this means the car stalls as soon as you remove your foot from the gas,remote door lock electronic board, the horn kept going off during the night; The Dealership in Dartmouth Nova Scotia has been great, but GM will not extend  the Warranty
 All this in 22 months..!!!!<br><br>
