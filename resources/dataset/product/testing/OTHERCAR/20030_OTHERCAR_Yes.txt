            My Grandparents bought a Red 1990 Dodge Omni two years ago and It is a great little car. It came equiped with dual cloth bucket seats, ac/heat, rear wiper, chrysler am/fm sterio with two 4&quot; Chrysler Speakers located in the driver and passenger side front doors. A fold down rear seat, rear defrost, and a driver side airbag. This car is a tuff little car. It has been hit by a 1995 Chevy Silverado Ext.Cab long-bed pickup and it didn't put a dint in it. Now it has 147,897 miles on it and the headliner is starting to sag, but next time I visit my grandparents it will be fixed. The ac quit working two months ago, but my grandparents don't mind. The driver side window won't roll down because a plasic wheel broke on it and I have to replace that. But thats all thats wrong with the car. It runs great and has good pickup. Just be careful of deep water puttles or the belts will squill.  <br><br>
