            Three months ago, I decided my old and worn out 1991 Cavalier was just about to give up the ghost, when I had a brilliant plan.  I decided to go buy a newer one.  I don't know why but having owned my first Cavalier for so long, I decided that maybe I was a Cavalier woman for life.

Being young and stupid I rushed out test drove a 2000 and less than two hours later was driving away with what I thought was my new dream car.  Don't get me wrong the things I loved then are the things I love now.  

I am a simple person and my four door coupe is as simple as it gets.  First there are no flairs on this car, meaning no spolier, no cd player, no hyped up wheels, and no tinted windows.  NO EXTRAS!  That what I wanted and that is what I got.  I guess what I didn't understand was that in giving up all the other things, I was also giving up the things I wanted most.  

First of all I wanted a smooth ride.  I did not get that at all.  I mean I am not smacking my head on the roof when I hit a small bump, but it is still not as smooth at I would like.  I also do not really like the bucket seats.  They feel kinda flimsy.  I also thought that since the Cavalier had been around awhile they would have figured out some way to make the seatbelts where they would  not constantly get twisted and tangled.  I know I do not like spending ten minutes before I go to work untangling and untwisting the seatbelt just so I can go.  Another thing that bothers me are the sad sad sad sounding speakers.  I am a music person from way back, and when I want to listen to music, I want to listen to music.  I am afraid to turn the volume up to loud, because when I do it sounds like the speakers are going to bust out of the trunk and maul me.

The back seat is ok.  There is room back there for two to three friends depending on sized and their willingness to sit really really close to someone who may or may not smell the best in the world.  So to families who have many large family member or families with many car seats, this car is not for you.  If you want comfort for everyone try something larger.

If this is for a high school/college kid, then this is perfect.  Good gas mileage, and room for your ten friends who just have to ride in the same car, even if some of them smell!
