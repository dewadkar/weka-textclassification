            We purchased a Polaroid PDC 300 Digital camera in December, 1998.  After years of watching the prices of digital cameras, it was exciting to
find one under $300.00.  This was purchased from our local Wal-Mart Supercenter and put to work immediately.  

My husband, Joe and I make an antique directory for Mid-Missouri. (JCAD)
http://www.lakeozarks.net/~jcad  We travel to 70+ towns across the state and write web pages for antique stores.  We travel several days a
week and use the camera daily after recharging the batteries each night.
The camera comes with Normal and Macro settings, Flash, Erase and the option to review the shots and erase and take new photo's, if needed.

We've taken over 15,000 pictures in 11 months. The software that came with the camera works real well with our computer, VCR or TV.  The
instructions were easy to follow and other than human error, all has been well.  Yes, I have hit the wrong key on the computer after erasing the
pictures from the camera and lost a set of pictures.  But, mistakes do happen!  Now I don't delete the photo's from the camera so quickly!

We have had trouble with the switch that changes from Play to Record. But Joe and our son took care of that problem by adding a new switch.

We have recommended this camera to many folks and enjoy it very much.<br><br>
