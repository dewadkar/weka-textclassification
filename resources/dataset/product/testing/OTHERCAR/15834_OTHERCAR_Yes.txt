            I previously owned a Sony DSC P20 digital camera.  It was their low-end camera, and I must say it looked like it.  With its blue plastic body, it almost looked like a toy.  It was very small, and it was a 1.3 megapixel camera, so I was ready to move up to something a little larger with a higher resolution.

I saw the new Sony DSC-P31 had arrived at a local store and was reasonably priced � little more than the P20 I had.  So I sold my P20 and bought the P31 just in time for a cruise I was about to go on.  I�m glad I did.

The camera is a little larger than the P20 was, so I didn�t have trouble with getting my finger in the way with this new cam like I was doing with the tiny P20.  The P31 produces sharp, clear photos.  I can tell that the higher resolution makes a difference.  I don�t normally print photos that I take digitally, but even when viewing them on the computer I can notice the difference in the resolution.

Speaking of, hooking up the camera to a computer to download photos is a piece of cake � at least with a Mac.  I plug in the camera, and the computer automatically fires up the software and is ready to download.

Outside the P31 looks a little more modern with it�s metal case.  It definitely doesn�t look like a toy, but its compact size is still very nice.  The LCD screen on the back is quite large for a camera this size.  And the picture on that screen is very sharp.  On the previous camera as well as this one, people have always commented on how clear and sharp the LCD screen is.

One thing I really love about digital photography is that if you don�t like the photo you just took, you can delete it.  This is also a plus if you find yourself running out of room on the memory stick.  The 8MB memory stick that the cam comes with is enough for everyday photos.  Of course, if you know you�re going to take many pictures at some big event, you should buy a larger stick.  But the 8MB stick can hold up to about 30 photos at a satisfactory resolution.

Speaking of changing resolutions, the method for doing that and changing other settings is relatively easy.  The on-screen menus are simple, and the manual is pretty specific with instructions.  The flash can be turned on all the time, turned off all the time, or set to automatic.

Something that I think is a great plus that came with this camera are the batteries with the accompanying charger.  I learned with my first camera that regular batteries last 30 minutes if you�re lucky!  So I had bought a charger and rechargeable batteries for that camera.  Now, with this camera, I had another charger and more batteries!  It also has a carrying strap to attach to the camera.  My advice is to also buy an inexpensive carrying case with an extra pocket or two for spare batteries and memory stick(s).

One drawback on this cam � and I must say it has caused me a couple of good photos � is the time it takes for the flash to recharge.  In other words, I can take a photo that uses the flash, but it takes a good 10-15 seconds for the flash to be ready again.  Sometimes a good photo can be missed in that 10-15 second time span.

The other negative is the lack of an optical zoom.  An optical zoom means that the lens of the camera actually moves to zoom in on the subject.  This camera does have a digital zoom, but that means that the camera is altering the digital image to appear to be zooming in.  This results in a fuzzier picture because of the pixel size.  There hasn�t been a whole lot of need for the zoom feature for me, but who knows if that would be the case if I did have an optical zoom.  Incidentally, it�s an optical zoom that makes digital cameras jump in price.

Overall, I would recommend this camera if you�re looking for a budget-conscious choice.  It�s great for sharing photos electronically (web, email, etc.) which is all I do.  I don�t print any of the photos.  And the price is very good.
