            I drive a 1994 Corolla in the Philippines, being in a tropical country, this may be a different review from your usual U.S. climate/condition reviews.

The car is OK for its price, it handles well, the engine is quite responsive, 115HP is adequate for everyday driving.

Manila potholes makes a drive on the moon feel like the autobahn. Every 10 feet or so, you'll experience bumps or dips as high/low as four inches... Roads are hardly flat... So it's a true test for any suspension... 

And this car didn't do quite well. Wheel alignment and camber is affected quite easily compared to the Civic and Lancer (Mirage) of the same year...

Road noise is apparent as well, largely due to the Goodyear NCT3 tires that are mounted on the wheels... but regardless, floor noise and wind noise is quite apparent.

The rear seat area is rarely occupied since my only passenger is my wife. But it is cramped back there. The Civic seems larger, but I think it's due to the thinner foam on its seats compared to the Corolla.

One common problem that Corolla owners I know face is the power window switches and motors, the frequency of repairs seems to be a bit too much.

There's also this perennial rear thugs and squeeks that you can't seem to find where it's coming from... I've ridden quite a few Rollas and most of them have this annoying noise.

Another problem is the glove compartment. It cannot withstand long periods of moderately heavy storage... the latch and the handle breaks quite often.

I wish the seats offer a bit more support as well... lumbar support and thigh support is not as good as the Civic or Sentra.

Another gripe that I have is the airconditioner... it simply can not handle the hot humid atmosphere here in Manila during march-june unless the thermostat is all the way up, which uses up a lot of gas (80% of travel here is stop and go traffic, from 6am-10pm)... and causes the evaporator to freeze up...

Good points... Very ergonomical for a car of its class, good design, decent 4AFE engine... I find the gear ratio a bit too high for 5th gear...

It's a good car... and since 1600 cars are usually made for economy, no-frills ride, this is a good car to own...

Not a bad car... It's probably the most abundant model of Toyota here up to now...
