            5 friends and I were driving from Abilene, Texas to Dallas, Texas.  We rented a Dodge Durango pretty much because that's all the car rental place had.  They said there was plenty of room for the 6 of us and since we were going to be picking up 2 people in Dallas to bring them back to Abilene, they said there was plenty of room.  WRONG!

First off, we are all ages 20-22 and our driver is in her 40's.  She drove and I sat up front since I had the shortest legs so I could be pretty far up.  There were two tall guys and two other girls in the group. Since one guy and gal were a couple, they sat in the back and the other guy and girl sat in the middle.

The girl in the back can easily get comfortable anyway, but her boyfriend was pretty much cramped the whole time.  The two in the middle were okay going.

When we got to Dallas to pick up our first friend, who's about 6 foot and built, the two in the middle moved over and let him in.  That was tight!  They were pretty close the whole way to the hotel.

On the way back, we easily decided that 8 people were not going to make it back to Abilene if we've got to sit next to each other that close.  Our 8th person decided to come back in another car and one of the guys went with her.  Even though they say 3 people can fit in the backseat, it would be very cozy.

And about the luggage area in the back, it's a good thing all each of us had was an overnight bag.  Without attaching things to the top could we have fit anything else in there!

I think that it's a good vehicle if you have children and get rid of it before they get to be teenagers.  Once all the kids start growing, they get too big for it.

The ride was smooth and we didn't have any mechanical problems, the A/C worked and the radio played fine.  The brakes worked too, we found out since we had to go through Dallas traffic.

If I needed a SUV or a car that holds lots of people, I'd go and get a Chevy.<br><br>
