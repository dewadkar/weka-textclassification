            The camaro Has Blown me away since that first time I pressed on the gas pedal. The Camaro is available in four models - Coupe, Convertible, Z28 Coupe and Z28 Convertible. The V6 and V8 engine were both revised for this year to meet low emission standards. New interior and exterior features include 16-inch aluminum wheels, new cloth fabric, body-colored outside mirrors and steering wheel radio controls. Standard features include air conditioning, a keyless entry remote system, tilt-steering and a folding rear seat. Optional equipment for this year includes a 12-disc CD changer, leather seating, six-way power driver's seat, power door locks and a Sport Appearance Package. The Sport Appearance Package contains a front fascia extension, rocker moldings, a rear spoiler extension and 16-inch aluminum wheels. <br><br>
