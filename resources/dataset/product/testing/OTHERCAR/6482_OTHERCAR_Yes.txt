            My wife and I just bought the Mercedes C-230K a couple of weeks ago. Believe me, we don't make the kind of money a usual Mercedes buyer makes. This car is unbelievable for that price. As of 05/03 there is a $3000 factory incentive as well, and that is another reason we just could not pass this up. I am still in shock that we own a MB, and I love to just look at it.

The car driving ability is excellent, this car is a coupe, but drives like a sedan. The handling is very impressive, without comprimising the luxury drive quality. I wish I can ramble on more about the drive, but you must test drive one to get the idea.


The power of the 1.8l Supercharger is just excellent! I am used to japanese 4cyls and when you stomp on the gas, you feel as though you are doing long term damage with the noise it creates. The Mercedes 4cyl is silky smooth and the power is very nice. The 1.8l is a new addition vs. last years version a 2.3 liter. They upgraded the engine because of better efficiency and I can see why. This car gets 32mpg on the highway, and still pumps out 189hp and 192lb-ft torque.

I originally looked at this car for 3 reasons. My wife got a new job but, and it was a long commute. So I wanted her to have a safe, comfortable, and reliable car. The safety is definitely there with 8 air bags, 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS, there version of traction control (ESP) and many more.

The interior, I believe is very quality, modern and comfortable. We chose leather seats for added comfort, and resale. I had to have a complaint on the CONS, but I believe if anyone complains about having an affordable Mercedes, you can afford to upgrade to their $50k and above vehicles. The complaints are so minor, that I will look them over any day. Some of the minor complaints are the switches for the windows are low to reach while driving, the side mirrors are small for viewing, and the rear visibility with the plastic see through glass is distorted.

All in all, we paid $27,500, for a retail price of $32,000. This came with 2 main packages of C1 and C5. Did I mention the Bose sound system is awesome too?

I haven't showed my family yet, but I can't wait to see the looks on their faces. Because, they are going to look at us like what kind of debt did we get ourselves into. For under $30k we have a full luxury vehicle, not a Korean brand luxury car, a true luxury car with the name Mercedes Benz badged to it.
