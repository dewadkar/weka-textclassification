                 The lease was up on my 1998 K-1500 with Silverado trim and Z-71 equipment. 
     Chevy was running as special on financing, so I bought the best looking truck I could find on the dealers' lots.
     I bought a 2000 Silverado K-1500 with sportside bed, Z-71 equipment and LS trim.
     In all honesty it falls short of the '98 in three areas. Chevy saw fit to lower it maybe two to three inches mostly in front to prevent roll-over, I guess. Handling is better at speed on winding roads, but if I wanted a sports car I would have bought a Corvette. Secondly, the  '98 was quieter. Possibly due to the LS not being the top of the line LT trim like the Silverado trim in the '98. Picky third is the Z-71 decal is less Bold.
     After you get past this though, it is all gold in the silverado. The optional 5.3 liter V-8 runs rings around the older 5.7 Liter Vortec. It throws out 30 more horsepower, but 5 lbs. ft. less torque. I can't say I noticed.
     The gold in the Silverado positively glows inside. It's buckets can handle our buckets just fine, thank you. The driver message is a fine addition if something should be amiss. The vents won't cool your coffee like the '98 would, the power points are easy to find and use, but beware the tiny handle on the cigaret lighter, the hot outer ring will bite fat fingers. You may need sunglasses when you look in the back. It's a seat that real humans can use, it may be for children or grandchildren or a couple slender adults or maybe one fat old white beard, but a good seat none-the-less. My 35 lb. dog used to complain about the rear '98 seat. You even have space under the rear seat for shovels and other hand tools now that they put the jack behind the seat. Automatic headlights, auto-lock and unlock doors, autotrack 4X4 (optional, but worth the $400. or so), plenty of console storage, overhead storage and cd storage (for your favorite four cd's). Even bigger side windows for folks (and the dog) in the rear.
     Even the spare tire is theft resistant.
     Who would drive this? Anyone who needs a pickup more often than a Tahoe or suburban, but wants the comfort and protection  the SUV's provide.<br><br>
