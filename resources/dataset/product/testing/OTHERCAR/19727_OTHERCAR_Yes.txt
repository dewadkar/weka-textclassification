            First thing - I'm very fussy. Second - being a motorcycle rider, I get very impatient with slow, clumsy cars. So when my Peugeot 505 began to need more maintenance than it was worth, I had to look for a replacement. What I ended up with was a Nissan Primera - sold in the USA as the Infiniti G20.  Mine is a 1991 model, but I didn't know where else to put this opinion, which may be of interest to you - in any case, mine has independent rear suspension (unlike current models)and is a well equipped Japanese import model with a full service history and low mileage.
To say it is a luxury sedan rather misses the point - image is hard to quantify, and the Japanese often fail to convince when it comes to establishing heritage and status.
I tried out a Nissan Sentra first - this was horrible and gave me whiplash from poor suspension control over rough roads.  The Primera allowed me to enjoy a 1,000 mile holiday cheaply and in full comfort. 
More importantly, any time I have a rush of blood to the head and carve corners as hard as possible, the Primera is always on my side. Having multi link suspension front and rear (like the 300ZX) it clings like there's no tomorrow - even if you get an apex wrong, the car will get you through.
This level of control has a slight down side in a lack of urban civility - the Peugeot would glide like a Caddy, but even it couldn't keep up with the Primera on a winding road.
There is climate control a/c, four wheel disk brakes, a four speed auto trans, and full electrics.  Front seats fit like a glove, there is sufficient room (but no more) front and rear. A powerful 1.8 engine gives 30mpg on trips, and the whole deal cost me $US4,800. At under 40,000 miles, I have years of trouble free fun motoring ahead of me.<br><br>
