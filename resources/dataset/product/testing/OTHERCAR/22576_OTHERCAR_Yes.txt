<TEXT>
            I have had my Pontiac Firebird since it was new in 1996.  My parents bought it for me when I was almost 17 because my old car, a 1976 oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was just about the most deadly car left on America's vast roadways.  Even though my car has only a V-6 (I just couldn't seem to get them to spring for the 305hp V-8!) it still has provided years of rapid transportation while keeping the cost of gas from ever leaving me penniless.  
I must admit that bright red is not the wisest of color choices since I have been pulled over no less then 6 times in the last 5 years, but I wouldn't trade that color for anything because it shines like no other.  Yes, my car is a bit impractical, for the exterior dimensions the interior is abominably small.  Yes, there is no trunk so to speak, but GM doesn't sell the F-body twins to families of 7.  
All in all, my Firebird has been a reliable, and very eye catching piece of transportation for the last 5 years and it will continue to serve me until I can independently purchase my next new car. . .a Corvette convertible.  <br><br>
