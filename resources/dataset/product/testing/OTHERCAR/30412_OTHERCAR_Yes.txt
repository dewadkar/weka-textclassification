            When I went to test drive the Chevy Suburban I was scared to death, thinking I'd feel like I was driving a bus.  But surprisingly it was not that bad.  I have had it for 1 yr. now and I feel comfortable driving it and have no problems driving it either.  I love it for the room inside. We have two children and seem to always have their friends with us too and need all that room.  It is definately a need for a family for the room. We have traveled in it and comfortably since there is plenty room for our luggage and ourselves without being packed in.  I feel much safer in it too since it is bigger and seems more heavier than other vehicles.  It is very reliable and pulls very good.  We pull our travel trailer or double trailer jetski with it every other weekend during the Summer months when we go camping.  Pulls with no problem at all.  <br><br>
