            History

    The NSX, or �nex� as I like to call it, is my first true sports car. No matter what us Bimmer owners/enthusiasts tell you my BMW 633CSi is not a real sports car, and my BMW 750iL is a sports sedan, after driving around in the nex I feel that the V12 7 is too slow! (see my review on a 1998 BMW 7 series, it helps as I make many references to the 750iL).
 
    It all started when I went looking for a sports car around my birthday. The nex was not on the top of my list, quite the contrary in fact, as I had, and still due to a degree, had a  �dislike� of non-European sport cars (largely because my favorite car companies are, Ferrari, BMW, Jaguar, Maserati, all European) So I went and looked at a number of cars most notably a Ferrari Testarossa, and Ferrari 348. These were great cars, but with one major problem, repair costs. To my great sadness, I had to look else where for a car (It had been my dream to join the Ferrari Owners Club since I could drive) I ended up looking around the showroom and happened upon a NSX parked next to Porsche 911. As far as statistics, though the Porsche produces 6 more horsepower it weighs more, making it the slightly slower car. Also, the nex kinda-looked like a Ferrari making me feel better, as opposed to (in my opinion) the very ugly �Porsche-Boxter-wannabe� 911. I had read that the NSX was known for reliability so it seemed like the best choice. 
    
    My red �97 nex (28,000mi used of course, never waste money on a new car, buy �em 3/4 years later for half the price) was equipped with a 6 speed manual It is also available with an auto, but for cars made 97+ it is better to get the manual simply due to the 40 horsepower difference between the 3.2L in the manuals and the 3.0L in the autos. This is also why it is best to buy a �97 as it was the first year to offer the 3.2L engine (and therefore the cheapest ^_^). The only problem was that I can�t drive a manual/stick. So I set out to learn on the car. Bad idea. VERY bad idea. I burned the clutch and had to pay $3300 to replace the flywheel and clutch. Well I eventually learned (I think, I hope, I pray) to drive the car.

Exterior

    As I said above the outside is very nice. Japanese automakers have been criticized for lack of originality in design (Lexus anyone?), but the NSX, though to the casual onlooker looks like a Ferrari, is definitely unique. The beautiful integrated tail spoiler with integrated brake light is wonderfully designed for both beauty and purpose. The general taillight treatment is simply wonderful, and I hope they keep it in the next NSX as a brand-specific styling cue like Ferrari�s Testarossa grill found on all 3 modern TRs. 
  
    Overall the car is small(width/length), relative to its original competitor Ferrari 348. It is about the same size as the Porsche, but in a different way. The Porsche is like a bubble, while the NSX denotes a flatter, sleeker pose.
This pose is a problem at times, though, as I am always getting the front scraped. Luckily, Honda engineers designed a relatively large plastic bumper/spoiler, which takes the abuse. If it gets really beat up, then it is only about 150 to replace it( A Testarossa�s plastic spoiler-bumper is over 5 times that)

    The majority of 97 NSXs are targa tops, allowing form open air driving(on this under Performance/Ride/Fun)

Interior/Comfort

    The interior is nicely appointed in stitched leather. The general ergonomic feel is better than the Porsche, and even the (now dated) Ferrari 348. But all of these are in pale comparison to BMWs. For a MSRP nearly equal to the MSRP of a 750il, the interior simply doesn�t compare. Ferrari fixed this problem back in the mid-nineties and Porsche within the last few years, but the NSX still lags a bit. A simple example is the fact that there is no Acura symbol on the steering wheel, it simply says �Acura� in an indent in the leather, which was ok for the early 90s, but not 1996 on. Still though the interior fit and finish is very nice, though it could be better.  

    The seats are an interesting oddity to say the least. They are comfortable and extremely supportive as a sports car seat should be. However they are only 4-way power. 
Again for the same 92k MSRP, I get 16 way power seats in my �98 BMW 750iL. Today you can get an industry leading 20 way power seat in the 2002 745Li (the replacement for the 750iL, the 760Li, promises even more �way powers�) It is unfair to compare the high end luxury to the sports car market, but I expect more than 4 ways for 92k! Still, though the seats are more comfortable to me than the Porsche�s. 
	
    A very nice feature (and one of particular concern to me) is that the seats move far, far back, providing more than ample legroom. At the farthest setting, I have to stretch a little, and I�m now 6� 4�. Head room is adequate, though tight if I want to really �get on top of the steering wheel� to provide maximum control. This is fixed if I simply remove the targa top, since then there essentially is no roof to limit headroom. 

Features/Amenities

	The climate control is effective, intuitive, and very easy to use, as is the radio. However, the CD player doesn�t play half my CDs, which is annoying to say the least. One of these days I will get the 6 disk changer in the back changed to an Alpine� that said the stock radio is very good, as it is a specially tuned Bose system. The sound is pronounced and properly enhanced, allowing you to listen to your favorite CD while the targa is off and the windows are down without missing a beat (below 90mph that is).
    
    That said, here I go again, but for MSRP of 92k, I want more features! My 750 gave me every thing I could ask for but the kitchen sink(and a heads up display, wouldn�t that be cool) A nex tech guy said, and I quote ��to save weight, features offered are limited.� Come on! A corvette gets a heads up display! I want one too!!(I really do, any info on good ones email me).

    Truck space is ok, not great. The Porsche had more room with its two trucks, but I am just happy with mine. If your desperate for trunk space, save your self a heck of a lot of $ an buy something else. This car is NOT intended for hauling. Daily driving its takes simply beautify, not cargo hauling. There is enough room for papers and such for you business people out there, and for moderate groceries.
   
Performance/Ride/Fun

    Wow. Fun. No warm blooded human male can come out of a real ride in the lil' nex without a big smile on his face. I thought it was just me at first, but all of my friends did it too, the big grin of joy and satisfaction. 
	
  Lets go from the top:
The clutch- its very light, very very light, making quick shifts easy.

The shifter- smooth and direct, short and precise. It literally forces itself to the next proper gear. Example you ask? 2nd-3rd, simply release gas, press clutch, press the shifter forward, then release clutch. Its super precise (unlike some American shifters ones I used)
 
The gears- short and sweet, with 6th as an overdrive with decent power for climbing hills and passing(though you really should downshift for that sometimes you just don�t want to). 

Grip- the car sticks like a fly to flypaper. Enough said.

Handling- precise and direct with good feedback. Like many midengined cars, handling shifts from under to oversteer close to the limit if you don�t know what you�re doing and dial in too much turn on a turn. Thankfully the computer kicks in and saves you, or rather tries to save you. You can�t rely on the computer, as if you really do something messed up, it can only help so much.  

Sound- the engine sounds wonderful. With the top on and the windows up, you hear a wonderful sound just behind you that envelopes you in its sweet melody. Over 3000 it really turns on with the full orchestra at 7000-7500 rpm range. Enjoy it a few times and then try it again with the targa off and windows down to hear the band again, but this time featuring exhaust tone, and a wonderful one it is, not loud and abrasive as some of my friends� civis, but marvelous, confident, and of course beautiful.  

    Another interesting thing, the car gets great gas mileage form its  3.2L V6, at about 22 mpg, which is amazing for a true sports car (just look at Ferrari�s numbers and see what I mean)

Maintenance/Reliability

    I change the oil every 2000 miles to be overly protective ^_^ but the car has given me no trouble (save the 3,300 clutch incident which I caused -_-) It truly is a wonder. Reliability is just amazing.	

Final Thoughts

    I love my lil' nex. It's fun. But personally, if I had to choose, I would take my old 7, as I have spent nearly two great years with that incredible automotive masterpiece.
