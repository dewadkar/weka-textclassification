            First things first, my Dodge Intrepid is a company vehicle and I didn't not have the option of other vehicles to chose from.  I was only allowed to choose the color (blue) which I love!  

To start, if I have a passenger over 6 foot tall in the passenger seat, they do not fit well.  With the cab forward design, I could travel with a small army in the back seat and trunk but not an average size man in the front!  If you are over 6 foot tall be ready to view the road through "Blue colored glass."  You can only see through the top part of the windshield because of the slope of the windshield and the inability to lower the passenger seat to a comfortable level.

Next, I have just about 31000 miles on my vehicle and the transmission went!!  And with that said, that is when I first had my encounter with Road side assistance.  I was traveling up a mountain road and heard a loud sound right before my car stalled and started rolling backwards down the mountain!!!  Thankfully for cell phones, I called Road side assistance, and since I didn't have an "exact address" as to where I was they could not help me.  I asked if I could call the local dealer who would know where I was to come and tow me and they said "NO" a dealer does not have the authority to send out a tow truck for a warranty repair!!  Meanwhile I am on the side of a mountain with a blown transmission!  AAA to the rescue!!

The Intrepid's radio has much to be desired as well.  Not a good sound at all!!  

You cannot see the Cruise Control buttons after the sun goes down!

My window has a wind noise that the dealership cannot figure out.

The driver's window makes an awful noise and gets stuck sometimes without rhyme or reason.

It does drive rather well when it is running!  And 

Even though it is a sleek looking vehicle, it is not a reliable one!
