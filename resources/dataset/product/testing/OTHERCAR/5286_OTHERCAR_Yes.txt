            I often drive my girlfriends 1998 Honda Accord. It handles effortlessly. I own a 1994 Dodge Stealth. (An attractive looking sports car) These two cars give a totally different type of ride. My Stealth feels every bump on the road and only seats two passengers comfortably. The Accord rides like a dream and handles extremely well on all roads. You feel like you're riding on a cloud. It is without a doubt a wonderful car. The only thing that I don't like about the car is the fact that she only bought a four cylinder. But in all honesty it has enough get up and go for the gas conscience consumer. (Please remember-I drive a very fast sports car) This is a luxury car. It fits five people very comfortably. I would recommend this car to anyone that wanted a dependable handsome looking family car. It comes with a rear spoiler and front bra if you want to dress it up and make it look sporty. It also has a top-notch stereo system with a CD player. Another important feature you'll find is a very roomy trunk. This car comes equipped with Michelin tires. I truly feel this car is a great value for the dollar. Good Luck, Jon.<br><br>
