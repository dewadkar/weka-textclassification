            Ever since I first saw the Neon in 1994 I knew I wanted one.  At the time I was only 14 years old so I had a while to wait.

What initially attracted me to the Neon was its cute &quot;bubbly&quot; appearance, it had smooth curves.  Also, the bright colors it was available in caught my eye as well.  I especially liked the &quot;brilliant blue&quot; color.

When I found out how affordable the Neon was, I was sold.  I knew if I wanted my parents to agree on buying me my first car it could not be some Mercedes or BMW type car.  I knew they would agree to the Neon, with a starting price of somewhere between $12,000 and $13,000. 
 
When it finally came time for me to get my car, 1998, I went straight for the Neon.  That year they changed &quot;brilliant blue&quot; to &quot;intense blue&quot; which I found awesome.

At the showroom, I sat in the cute little car, but inside was not little at all.  Ok, it's not huge inside, but if you look at the outside you wouldn't expect that it could be comfortable inside, but it is.

Throw on a few extras like power windows/locks, power sunroof, spoiler, and fog lamps and you've got a nice looking car for a great price.  I've had my Neon now for over a year and a half and she still runs fine and looks cute as ever.

The only thing I can complain about is the all thoughts of upgrading my car after 2 years or so left my head when I saw the next neon's body.  It's nothing like the original and no longer is made in all the fun colors...what's a neon without neon colors?<br><br>
