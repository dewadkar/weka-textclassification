            When I first purchased this camera, I was looking to augment a 35mm camera that I could use for snapshots when I wanted images to transfer electronically.  While the 1.3 megapixel resolution has been passed by cameras offering 3+ megapixels (and I have since moved up...), this great camera can still address most needs for electronic sharing of images while offering capability to print out photos up to 5x7.

Overall design is good.  Shape and ergonomics work well - the camera seems familiar in hand compared to some of the more trendy and smaller units available. Controls are where you expect to find them.  Zoom button is a little small, but your finger will find it okay.  All controls functioned well and were well placed. The menus weren't always intuitive, and you have to spend some time with the cumbersome manual to figure out how to make everything work.  I do wish the delay in the shutter release and the delay until ready for next picture were shorter, however.  Integrated lens cover saves the misplaced lens cap.  Closing the cover, with the stop so close to the lens (to return the lens to the stored position) would welcome a more positive detent.  This is a small price to pay, however, for eliminating the cap nuisance. 

FlashPath floppy adapter that was included is a real plus.  While several companies offer SmartMedia to USB pods for transfer of images, I found that the FlashPath adapter was very handy to transfer an image to another computer while away from my desktop (although you do have to load a driver on the PC before the adapter can be used).  I found this easier to use than messing with cables and the serial port.

I found image quality excellent - lens quality appears good.  When used with an H-P inkjet printer, the results in the highest SHQ resolution mode delivered good prints up to 5x7.  The resolution is too low when trying to get 8x10s.

An AC adapter is recommended if you use the LCD screen extensively to review photos. The LCD screen will devour batteries, although you can use standard alkaline AAs rather than dealing with a proprietary battery pack.

Summary - an excellent camera that offers a lot of features.  Works well for those new to digital photography who want to take snapshots of the vacation, kids, etc.
