            Well, it was bound to happen, my 1991 Mazda B2200(see my review) finally had to have a major repair.  Five days in the shop over Labor Day weekend. Well, I'm not a very good homebody, I need wheels! A few calls and a trip to Hertz later, and I found myself in a 2002 Highlander by Toyota.
Well, if you are in the market for a mid-size SUV, you would be a fool to pass on a test drive of this beauty.
Let me get a few things out of the way first. My Highlander was a two wheel drive that came with a 220-hp VVT-I DOHC V6 engine. One thing that shocked me was the fact that this was a front wheel drive SUV. I mean, I've driven both rear and front wheel drive vehicles, if you've driven both you know that in a rear wheel drive you are pushed and in a front wheel drive you are pulled which sometimes can be unpleasant on the joints, because of the sudden pull on your body. I could have sworn that the Highlander was rear wheel drive, I'm serious, there was no front wheel jerk that you get with front wheel drive trans-axles. This is a major thing for me, I mean a drive is supposed to be pleasant right?
Under the hood is that 220 horse V6, man oh man, plenty of power!  I'm talking about an engine not even breaking a sweat running at only 3000rpm while doing 81 MPH!
I'm so used to being a bit underpowered, that I found myself going almost 90 miles an hour several times by mistake! If you were wondering about power, there is no doubt you have enough with the V6. As far as the 4 cylinder goes, you should test drive one first before buying, don't buy a 4cyl on this recommendation.
The Highlander handles like a dream, superb power steering, smooth, yet it hugs the road like a worn pair of blue jeans, just right!
Mileage was so so, but that may have been because I was driving like a speed freak, I got maybe 18 MPG, but I think it was closer to 17 or 16 MPG. If not for the constant pedal tromping it would have been better, I assure you.
Interior was beautiful!  Whoever coordinates the color schemes at Toyota should get an award, they have an amazing eye.  All my friends kept using words like "tight, beautiful and smooth" to describe the interior diggs.
The drivers seat was 8 way power adjustable, there was no position this thing could not conform to.
The sound system was surprisingly shallow, it had great bass, but seemed to have problems giving me the true surround sound effect that I enjoy. This could be because of two reasons, one Hertz didn't bother to spring the extra bucks and went with the basic sound system, or, Toyota's sound systems suck.  Now before you blame Hertz, remember that for most of the 80's and 90's the Japanese were notorious for building great cars with crappy sound systems, if you wanted great sound, you built it yourself!
Keep this in mind when you're out shopping.
Besides that the radio and A/C controls were perfectly placed and were within easy reach.
Seating was spacious, and my one and only back seat passenger seemed quite comfortable, the Highlander seats five. The seats can also be folded if need be, flat for extra space.
A/C is cold, but to be truthful aren't all of them cold now?
And last but not least, the looks. The Highlander looks awesome! I mean wow! Lest you not think this is not a big deal, take a look at the 2003 Ford Expedition, look real close, it looks exactly the same as the 2002 Ford Explorer only bigger! The Jeep vehicles looks are boring and old, Nissan's Exterra looks just like the Frontier pickup they make. And the Honda Pilot?  Though I'm sure the Pilot is a wonderful SUV, it looks just like the CRV only bigger!  What's wrong with these people?! Can't they spend a little more and at least spice it up with different headlamps?
Well, suffice to say the Highlander does not look like it's siblings. It is a bonafide SUV hottie, a head turner wherever you go.
The one problem that I had with my rental was that when I hit the unlock button on the keyless entry system, for some reason the passenger side doors would not unlock, I think this may have been related to this vehicle and not to all Highlanders in general.
If you are a woman considering this SUV, you will enjoy the room the safety and the visual range the seating gives you.
If you're a man like me you will love the pure power of 220 horses and the stunning looks.
