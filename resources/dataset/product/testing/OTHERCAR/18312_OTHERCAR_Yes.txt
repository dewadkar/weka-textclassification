            Good camera for the buck-fairly easy to use and has the zoom capability that really comes in handy-compared to other digital cameras the quality is very good-comes with the Digita desktop software that lets you do a lot of editing - the IR download to your PC is nice, although download time can be long, especially with the larger 8Mb &quot;Film&quot; packs.  
  Downside to camera - really a lousy case comes with the camera; spend a few dollars and get a better one that protects the lens;should have come with a protector cap. The function buttons on the back of the camera that are used to toggle functions are a bit small and can be a problem if you rush (you can go past the function you want and have to go back in the menu).  The battery life is terrible-you will want to get extra rechargeables for this camera-but other digital cameras have the same problem...not the best on the market but certainly one with more features than others in the price range.<br><br>
