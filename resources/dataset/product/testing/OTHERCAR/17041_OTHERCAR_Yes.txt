            My husband and I purchase one of the first Durango's that came out in 1998.  We absolutely love it and have not had any problem with it in the past 2 years.  This SUV is by far the best vehicle we have owned.  We decided to purchase it when we were having our second child.  We previously owned a Jeep Cherokee Laredo (2 door) and really needed the room. 

Neither one of us had ever owned a Dodge vehicle before, and are very impressed with the quality of service received from Dodge.  The truck is extremely reliable, roomy and comfortable.  We went all out and got every option (leather, CD, etc).  One of the main selling points was the fold down third seat.  It allows us to travel together with other family members who have children.  The kids love being 'way in the back'.  My husband uses the vehichle for his business equipment, which is pretty heavy. It handles the load well - the tail drops, but not significantly.

The Durango handles well and drives smooth, like a car.  It's surprisingly quite.  We did get the larger side view mirrors, which do cause blind spots when making a left turn. I would recommend getting the air for the back area.  This SUV is not too big, like the Expedition, or too small, like the Ford Explorer.  

I would recommend this vehicle for people who have changing needs, and need the flexibility of having the third seat or additional room.
