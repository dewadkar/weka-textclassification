            We bought this car in March of 2001.  We had just had our second child, and we needed something with 4 doors, and more room.  We bought it from an elderly man that had owned it since it was brand new.  Though it is 11 years old, it only had 91,000 miles on it, and it seemed in fairly good cosmetic shape.  I know nothing of mechanical workings or parts, but my husband assured me that it was in fine mechanical condition.  

It was about two months after we bought it that I noticed little things started to fall apart.  The material on the doors started to peel away.  The rear view mirror fell off.  The seat belt buckle lost its plastic covering. The left blinker stopped working.  The drivers door will only open from the inside.  These are all relatively minor problems, that we had no difficulty in dealing with.  After another few months larger problems arose.  The alternator had to be changed.  The muffler had to be replaced, and the shocks and struts had to be done.  These are all problems that my husband assures me are normal wear and tear on a car this age.  I will admit that these problems were taken care of with minimal effort, however, it still annoyed me. Oh yeah, and the radio is less than desirable, and it has no cassette player.

Well, now that I've complained, and gotten it out of my system, I'll tell you the good points.
I get about 35 miles to the gallon on the freeway, and 27 in town.  Pretty good for such an old car, and with the price of gas being where it is, definitely a perk.  The Air conditioner blows cold, and I mean cold!! There is enough room to comfortably seat 3 adults and two kids (plus car seats) The trunk is huge!! I've managed to fit 11 bags of groceries and a stroller in it.  The paint still looks good, no rusting or chipping.  And, most importantly we've had no major mechanical problems.  It has never left me stranded in the middle of nowhere.
