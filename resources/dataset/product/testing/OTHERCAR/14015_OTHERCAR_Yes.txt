            This is the car that I would have liked to own, but opted out on because of the price.  It is sleek looking with lots of perks.

Some of the exterior perks that I liked were the 17" wheels, fog lights, and HID lights.  I just thought that it was a nice looking car all around.

The interior is great with standard leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, and shifter.  The standard stereo is an in dash 6 CD changer.  The steering wheel has the controls for the radio, cruise control, and trip monitor.

One of the coolest features I have ever seen in a car is a retractable cup holder on the passenger side that sits above the air conditioning vent, and keeps cold drinks cold.  There are also two cup holders in the console.

On the dash panel, you find your MPG, which is supposed to be over 20, your average speed, time elapsed, distance until you are out of gas, and outside temperature.  Their is also automatic climate control, which is great since I am a smoker who must have the windows open while I smoke, and my husband gets cold.

Another big perk is that the car is set up for 100,000 mile tune ups.  I remember when you couldn't even drive a car for 100,000 miles.

The test drive I took showed a nice quiet ride, with comfortable seating for driver and passenger alike.  This is my if I hit the lottery car.
