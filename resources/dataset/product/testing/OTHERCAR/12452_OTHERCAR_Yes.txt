            I just need to say one thing...Volvo has come a long way not only with quality but styling as well.  I never thought that I would be saying that I love Volvo cars let alone want to drive one someday possibly as my own car.  I used to always think when I was younger that Volvo cars looked horrible and were so ugly...but then they redesigned their whole line and well, they did a nice job!

This is a very nicely designed car, very solid and stable, great pickup and braking. The interior is nicely laid out, lots of storage space inside including the trunk and roomy seats. Not to mention the seats are very comfortable! It could seat five almost comfortably. I felt very safe in this car, felt very in control and throughly enjoyed the ride and the experience. 


The engine, I believe, has about 160HP (dont quote me on that...im not 100% sure) and I think it is a 1.9 inline four cylinder. It might be a turbo charged engine also. Even so, the small engine doesn't matter because it has excellent pickup...you're at 40 or 50 MPH before you ever realize it. This car also has four wheel ABS disc brakes (stopping abruptly is a piece of cake with this car) and day time running lights but I think all Volvo cars have that.  From what I understand, the S40 comes only with an automatic transmission.  

And the steering...forget about it...nice and tight and very very smooth control with the wheel and precise handling. You can feel the road, each curve and turn, and the ride is perfect...no hard bumps to feel or jolting. Not to mention Volvo is famous for its safe cars and Volvo can last almost forever. I have known people who have Volvos and they have an average of 150,000 miles on it and its still running solid. But like with all cars, they have to be maintained. 

This car, pricewise, is designed for younger buyers who aren't quite yet making the big $$$. The base price is about $23,000 which isn't bad. The only complaint I have is the option packages. Even so, there are a ton of standard features but if you want a moonroof, for example, you have to get options you may not need. The option packages are not very flexible. That is why I like Oldsmobile so much..you can add what you want and take away what you really do not need with the car. For me, a moonroof, power seats/windows/locks, and a decent sound system is all I need. That is where the extra money comes in too because the packages range from about five hundred to about two thousand.  

There are five packages, the sports, sports plus, cold weather, touring and sunroof package.  The cheapest option package, from what I recall, is the sports package.  For me the packages are so inconvenient because with the options that I want, I would end up having to purchase most, if not all, of the option packages.  

The S40 is one of their smaller cars but even so, it still has plenty of room and it comes in a variety of beautiful colors. My favorite color of theirs was the metallic blue.  The faux wood interior is another thing I didn't find very appealing. It looks to cheesy in this car and out of place.  

I recommend this car to almost anyone...that is, if you have the money for it because with the options you want, if any, the price can become as high as the S70 base price as I was told by our Volvo dealer. But if you want a fun, safe, and reliable car then perhaps you should check out this car.  

Yet if Volvo hadn't changed their styling I doubt I would have ever considered this car. I'm so happy my parents got this car or else I would have never had the pleasure of experiencing this car! Now...the C70...I could only dream of having that car! 

(Figures though, my parents both get new cars and I'm stuck with a Mustang when I have two great cars right around the corner!  As I learn more though from driving this car when I can I will keep adding what I can to this opinion)
