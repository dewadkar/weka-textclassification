            I bought this car the week they came out.  Having previously owned two Jeep Cherokee Sports ('92 and '99) and LOVED both, I assumed the Liberty would just wow me.  The lease on my '99 was up, so I test-drove the Liberty, and (in haste) bought it and liked it.  I didn't yet love it, but I liked it.  I spoiled myself and bought the Limited... figured if I was buying a car I might as well buy something I will like and keep for a while, so leather seats and fancy gadgets seemed worth it.

The car ran well for the first 18 months.  I had to grit my teeth each time I had to stop for gas (which was VERY frequent) because I averaged only 17.6 mpg, according to the car's computer.  But, other than that, it was fine.  It drove pretty well, for a heavy, tall SUV.  It's certainly not designed to be sporty by any means.  A very smooth ride with indepedent suspension - much "cushier" than my Cherokees' stiff suspensions.  It's quite underpowered, too.  A 210 horsepower engine should move, but it's pulling a car that actually WEIGHS MORE than the Grand Cherokee.  My little Cherokees only had 180(?) hp, and they could move.  

This past February, my Liberty developed a significant flaw.  After driving for a short distance (say 15-30 mins or longer), if the engine was turned off for a short time, it would often not restart.  So imagine, you've gone out to do some errands, you stop to get gas (a frequent in this car) and as you get back in ready to leave the gas station, guess what?  Your car is dead.  It would turn to the "on" mode, where you can turn on radio, etc., but when it was pushed to the "IGN" mode where the engine actually turns over, absolutely nothing happened.  AFter sitting for anywhere from 5 to 55 mins (my record) the car would finally restart and run, but sometimes only until the next stop where it would begin all over again.  

AFter the first incident, I immediately took it to my local dealer, whom I had used to buy my '99 and the Liberty, and told them the problem.  They took a look, and "couldn't find anything" or get this problem to "happen" to them.  As it kept happening, I kept taking it back to the dealer.  I wrote a long, detailed letter to Chrysler, and they replied to me saying they would get in contact with the dealer.  Over the course of the repairs, my dealer rented me cars on 2 separate occasions, keeping the car for 4 or 5 days each time.  Finally, on the FIFTH time taking this car in for this problem (they were still unable to detect problem, even after talking with Chrysler's tech team), I requested that the head of service drive my car to and from work until it happened to him.  And FINALLY, it acted up for him.  So, they replaced the starter, claiming it as faulty.  My car problems were solved!

No.

The NEXT day, driving around doing errands, it happened again.  I was beside myself.  I thought, "You mean to tell me that a whole staff of 5-star technicians and one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the US, if not the world, can't figure out how to fix ONE OF THEIR OWN CARS?!?!"  I later found out, by the way, that the mechanic drives a Honda Accord, which is one of the most reliable cars out there... and I don't have to wonder why!

So, I started car shopping myself.  

I got an unimpressive trade in for it; being only 2 years old with 30K miles, this car lost more than half it's value in that time, and cost me more headaches, made me late to appointments and work, and NEVER got solved by a team of mechanics and their corporation!  A total LEMON.

I am picking up my 2004 Subaru Outback Sport on Tuesday.  It's twice as fuel efficient, has more standard safety features than my $26000 Jeep did (such as ABS and dual stage airbags), still has AWD, has plenty of cargo room and will save me time, money and headaches.

I realize I am one of many reviews, and own one of thousands of Jeep Libertys that are out there, but even if you want an SUV, especially a short, tall, heavy, gas guzzling one, ask yourself, "Do I really NEED this car?"  I took my Liberty off road about 2 times, and I have to say, it handled incredibly well.  If you plan on doing this a lot, get this car.  If not, why do you really want it?  It's also quite ugly, which I have always thought, but now I detest it!  

Happy car shopping!  Avoid Chrysler is my advice.
