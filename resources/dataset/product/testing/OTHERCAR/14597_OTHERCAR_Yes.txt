In 1991, I purchased a brand-new Honda Accord, model EX. I have never been so impressed with the reliability and efficiency of an automobile as I have with this one. In the entire time I've owned it, it has never broken down, over-heated, or refused to start in cold weather - pretty impressive seeing as it has been through numerous long trips and survived 8 New England winters outside in the elements. The closest it has ever come to any form of trouble was about three months ago when a mechanic recommended that the timing-belt be replaced - which is pretty standard for mid-sized cars with 80,000+ miles anyway. It's gas mileage is and always has been excellent. At 8 1/2 years, it still commonly gets 300 miles on 10 gallons (in mixed driving conditions - some highway, some stop-and-go). The pickup is still pretty impressive, though not quite what it used to be. All-in-all, it's what i love in a car - dependable, efficient, inexpensive, and lacking in flash and all that nonsense. I highly recommend it to all such drivers who seek the same qualities - although check the prices on the more recent models as I have not kept up with that...
