            <b>Why I decided on the S200 Digital ELPH:</b>

I'm sold on Canon cameras.  We've really liked the Canon EOS Elan-7E SLR we got a little over a year ago.  It takes amazing photos and was an incredible step up from the dinky point-and-shoots we'd had in the past. 

After reading the reviews of the S110 (S200's predecessor)on this site, I decided it was worth a look.  I also knew that the S200 fell within a price range I was comfortable with ($350).  The next step up is the S330, but I didn't think it was worth the extra $50-75 bucks.  The only advantage I could see on the S330 was the 3X Optical Zoom (compared to 2X on the S200) and the additional speaker for sound playback.  The S300 is noticeably bigger than the S200.  We wanted a small camera so we would be more likely to tote it around.  Advantage S200!  

<b>General Specifications:</b>

* 2-megapixel sensor captures 1600x1200 images for prints at sizes up to 8"x10"
* Autofocus lens with 2x optical/2.5x digital zoom(5x total)
* Focal length, 35mm equivalent:  35-70mm
* 3-point TTL Autofocus
* Max. Aperture:  f/2.8
* LCD size:  1.5"
* Internal flash (Auto, Auto w/ red-eye reduction, On, Off, Slow Sync) 
* Included 8 MB CompactFlash card holds 12 images at default settings (we get about 14-15 images on average)
* Connects with PCs and Macs via USB port 
* Uses proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery(included) 
* Size: 3.4" x 2.2" x 1.1" (87mm x 57mm x 27 mm)
* Weight: 6.3 oz (180g), w/out battery

<b>First Impressions:</b>

* The small size is shocking.  I bought it without seeing it in person.  Be careful not to sit on it if you put it in your back pocket.
* Camera is easy to use out-of-the-box.  Reading the instructions first isn't all that important, even though I've never had a digital camera before.
* On-camera menu is easy for deleting unwanted images or rotating images (though the camera automatically recognizes portrait format when you turn the camera...cool)
* Loading the included software on the computer is a little tricky on Windows 2000.  The program is very unstable when hooking it to the camera while running off the battery.
*** You almost have to get the A/C adapter (ACK500) if you want to dump a bunch of images on your computer.  I shelled out another $50 bucks for the adapter and the connection problems to the computer ceased.***

<b>Negatives:</b>
* It's so small I forgot I had in my back pocket and I almost sat on it.
* The A/C adapter is necessary for prolonged computer connections.  It's expensive ($50-$70) and proprietary.  The kit comes with a dummy battery component to which the adapter plugs into.  You cannot buy a generic A/C adapter for this camera!

<b>Buying Tip:</b>
The prices for this camera have dropped to around $330 since I bought mine.  Look for a deal that includes a free 32MB flash card and free shipping.  You'll want this card anyway ($25 value) because the 8MB card included is pretty useless.  I don't like to promote companies...but I'd rather save you some time looking-----I got mine from the company that's named for a jungle/river. ;-)
