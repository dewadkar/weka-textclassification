            I got this camera when it first came out in March of 2000(I awalys am the first on the block to have somthing new :-) ) It was purchased at Circuit City. Yea, Like Everything new it was great for the first month or so that I had it. Then the Problems started happening, which I will explain to you in the following paragraphs. 


Problems 
Cheap Camera Housing 
I found that this camera will scratch VERY easily, and the finish wears off of it over time. My Entire Zoom Slider Button is black because the silver paint slowly wore down. 

Floppy Drive 
Well this Is a LONG story, and it really ruined a vacation. A week before I went to Florida for a Week in Feb. of 2001(Delray Beach and Disney) I bought a Sony Digital 8 Handycam(your thinking right now, this isnt what the review is on, but just read on). The Handycam could take as all camcorders can, Movies, and still images. So great I thought, I would only need to use it for the Video because the stills are horrible quality. Now back to the review, the FD-90 worked fine all Week in Delray, and I got about 200 pics from the camera. Then We flew to Orlando/Disney. The camera worked fine at the airport etc.. When we were in Disney I went and tried to take a Picture. When I did there was a slight "Pop" that came out of the camera. I tried to take a pic again thinking that maybe the disk was not spinning properly. It still didnt work. So then I tried to remove the Disk from the drive and found out that it was stuck in there. I took it to the Epcot camera center, and found out that I knew more about cameras then they did, so they gave me a tool kit and let me sit down at a table to try and remove this disk. I worked and worked at it until I finally got it by moving the disk up enough for it to go over the pins that will spin the disk. So I had no camera for the entire time I was at Disney. Oh wait, I thought!!! My trusty new Handycam can take still images, so I used that for the 3 days I was in Disney. And you know what happens, low quality stills are not a great thing to look at, but who cares I thought, I could get a Replacment Advance Exchange unit Overnighted to me at the hotel and I would be good to go the next day, guess what the answer was? NO. So fine I had to chew on the fact that I had no "Real" digital camera for the trip. When I got back home I took the camera to a Sony Repair Shop to get it fixed. I found out that Sony's Warranty was 90 day Labor and a year on parts. So I had to Pay $170 for labor in a 10 month old camera. BTW They later found out that the Floppy Drive locked up on me and jammed, that was the pop sound. 

Warranty

Floppy Disks 
Yea They are small, but you can only store as much as 1.4 MB will hold, which results in tens and tens of floppy disks, and Ive lost a few and lost with them some fairly good pics. 


No Viewfinder 
Sometimes you just need an optical viewfinder to do the job for ya, espically at plays etc... Dark theatere and this LCD Screen lighting it all up 

2-3 Second Delay 
I found that there is a 2-3 second delay from when I press the shutter button until the time that the image is actually taken. Ive missed lots of things because of that(Fireworks, Picture Perfect Moments etc...) 

Some Pros about this cam are 

2.5" LCD Screen 
It comes in handy when framing shots!!! 

InfoLithium Battery Series 
This is one thing about Sony that keeps making me buy their products. It gives you a Time(In Minutes) that you have left of battery juice. Which is VERY handy when you have just got to know. 


I Just Bought(11/1/01) a New Sony DCP-770 Memory Stick Digital camera, and LOVE It!!! Read my review on it
