            Everything you hear about the service at a Saturn dealership is so true!  We wanted a good, inexpensive but dependable car when we went vehicle shopping in 1995.  We decided to go with the Saturn SL after seeing what was offered.  That car was wonderful!  We never had any problems with it and going to the dealership for recommended service really WAS an enjoyable experience.  We traded it in (reluctantly) for a 4X4 truck when we found out we'd be moving to northern Alaska...although I've heard that Saturns perform well in snow conditions.  The car had plenty of &quot;pick-up&quot; for us and it never let us down.  We'd definitely recommend a Saturn to anyone looking for a great car.  In fact, in a couple years, we plan on buying another one.  <br><br>
