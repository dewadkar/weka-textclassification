            After much debate my husband and I decided to buy a mini-van, as a young couple with only one child it was a big step, but well worth it! We already have a 2000 Explorer Sport and needed something with some more room, having a four year old we were quickly running out of room for all of his things! So we traded in my 1997 Mercury Mystique. We got an amazing deal on my Villager, and we love this thing!! We've put almost 1000 miles on it in the two weeks that we've had it, we can fit all our things in it and still have room to stretch out!! Getting the floor mats up to move the seats may be the hardest part. It also took me awhile to find the tether strap anchors, but once I found them things have been great! Our son loves having his own space and air controls! The multiple cup holders have also been rather helpful!! It drives so smoothly! My husband is amazed at how well it handles. The conversation mirror is also a nice feature, I can pull it down and check on my son while he's sleeping!

**UPDATE**

Well I still love my van, but we've had a problem or two. 

Removing the middle seat can be hard, in fact, we've vowed never to remove it again! Putting it back in was hard! Rolling the third seat wasn't so easy at first as well, the bag holding the jack (I'm assuming this is what it is, we've never actually opened it, I suppose we should) would get stuck making it impossible to roll. We've since put the seats back where they should be and have left it alone!

During the summer the A/C would make an abnormally loud noise when turning on at first, I was told this was normal, I'm not so sure!

The latest problem has been a noise while making turns, there is some question as to if this is under the current recall, though we haven't been notified of the recall yet. 

Other then that it's been great! We've had several trips with our son, my husband and I and friends with out problems, we've even had a few nights out on the town and 6 adults fit comfortably. 6 months later it now has 9,300 miles on it!<br><br>
