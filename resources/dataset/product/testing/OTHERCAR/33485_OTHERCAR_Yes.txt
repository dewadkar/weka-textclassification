            October of 1990.  We were young and had a three year old son.  He was handicapped and we knew our Dodge Colt and our Mustang were just not going to cut it with a wheelchair in the coming years (sniff...I really miss that Mustang).  We were now in that "our next car has to be PRACTICAL" mode.

It was not too hard to realize that a van would meet our needs.  What we needed was a van that was not too expensive and got good gas mileage...a minivan would be in order.  Here's what our choices were at the time (remember, this was eleven years ago...some things may have changed):

Mitsubishi...they put the "mini" into minivan.  Horribly small, rigid seats, rattled alot.  Pass...

Mazda MPV...back at this time, the MPV had two strikes against it.  The side door swung out (like the back door of a regular sedan) which did not give us enough room to get a wheelchair through it.  It also was rear-wheel drive which meant that a hump for the drive shaft tunnel ran the length of the van.  Not able to get a wheelchair to roll across it.

Ford Aerostar...This was in the days before the much better Windstar debuted.  The Aerostar had two steps up into the van and a horrible engine access hatch between the front seats.

Dodge Caravan (or Plymouth Voyager)...Removable center seat (with a lot of effort) meant a wheelchair could fit in.  A low, flat floor throughout the van meant we could get it in and roll it around with a minimum of effort.  Easy access to the engine compartment.  A price lower than the rest.  Bingo!

We got our van after shopping at three dealers for $14,500.  One dealer quoted $14,999.  When another dealer asked what it would take and I said beat that price, the final price was presented.  Cerritos Dodge near Los Angeles got the sale.

This price included A/C, a powerful 3.0L V6 engine (20-22 MPG), AM/FM Stereo Cassette, Power Steering, and Tinted Windows.  

We immediately took out the center seat.  It continues to be stored in our garage...occasionally, we will put it in when we have a big group.  The area it vacated is the perfect size for a wheelchair.  This also has the effect of giving anybody riding in the back a huge expanse of leg room.

The Caravan suited our needs perfectly but it has not been a complete bed of roses.

At 96,000 miles...just before a planned road trip...the transmission gave out.  $1200 dollars later, a rebuilt trannie took its place.  The Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor went out three times.  It's just a thirty dollar part that's easy to replace but one of those times was in the middle of the desert nessecitating a long and expensive tow to the Chrysler dealer in Bullhead City, Arizona.  To their credit, they fixed it quickly and rather cheaply once I got it in there.

The interior panels don't hold together very well.  The screws holding them in loosen up very easily.  At 125,000 miles it started to leak oil very slowly...about a quart every two months.  The weather stripping on the windows leak at the car wash.

Except for the transmission, the problems have been relatively minor.  The fit and finish is not all it could have been, but for the price the car has done the job we have asked of it very well.

It has since been supplanted by a Plymouth Voyager with more bells and whistles on it, but our Caravan still chugs on as my commuter vehicle to the bus station.  It still drives fine, is still powerful, and still gets good gas mileage.  This is one car I will drive till it dies.
