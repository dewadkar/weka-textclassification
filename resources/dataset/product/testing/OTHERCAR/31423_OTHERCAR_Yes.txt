                 The Jaguar name rings quality, elegance, and performance.  I recently aquired an XK8 and it drives like a dream.  After owning a Corvette and getting used to a rather rough ride I was surprised to find how smooth the XK8 rides.  The interior is quality leather and the wood paneling adds a touch of class.  The sound system delivers excellent sound so your son or daughter (if they are fortunate to drive it) won't complain about a lame stereo system.  The pick-up of this car is also impressive.  It handles very well.  I think the best feature is the automatic convertible top that works even when you drive (don't try this at high speeds).  Another good thing about owning a Jaguar is the quality of service and attention you and your car will receive at the dealership!!!  The only thing I don't like about this car or with any sports car for that matter is the low visibility but visibility in the Jaguar XK8 is better then other sports cars.  I enjoy driving this baby every where and I hope that in the future you will too.
