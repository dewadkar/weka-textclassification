            Believe me if you want, I enjoy my Jeep.  But, I realize you have to be ready to foot the bills when it does go to the shop.

I found this out a few weeks ago.  For some reasons, my Jeep started acting kind of weird.  The clutch was kind of loose, spongy type.  So I checked my master cylinder brake fluid.  It was kind of empty.  So I filled up.  Then two days later, it was almost dry.  I checked out very well.  To my surprise, I realized I had a huge leak under my hands.  I took it in to repair the master cylinder fluid bottle.  I only drove out of the shop before having to take it right back in. The gear shifter got stuck on third.  I had to drive all the back this way. Here, the cost was $165.00.

What could have been wrong with my Jeep which never gave me any problems up to then?  It was all a mess.  The shop clerk somewhat knew that one way or the other, he would make more money out of me.  That's when he explained that the slave was bad and his guys would have to go inside and take a look at the whole system.  Basically, I had to purchase the whole clutch kit.  It seemed to make sense after he explained the whole thing. He said that the Wranglers are even worse with this proble.  The Jeep company is aware of this problem..But they have not done anything about it yet.  Why place the slave and other key part inside instead of placing them outside or in accessible area?  He also said that the new Fords have the same problems.

So, I forked &amp;485.00 to have a new clutch on the Jeep.  So that was my headache with my Jeep.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy the ride afterwards.<br><br>
