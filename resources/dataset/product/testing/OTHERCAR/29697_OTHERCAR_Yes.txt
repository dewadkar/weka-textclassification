            I'll be honest. When Infiniti first introduced the QX4 several years ago, I thought it was ugly. Perhaps it was the huge fog lights in the bumper, or the relatively undersized tires and unattractive wheels. The slabs of silver "two-tone" plastic cladding didn't help either.

At the time, I also thought SUVs were gas-hogging trucks with inflated price tags, so the thought of paying extra for what essentially was an underpowered Nissan Pathfinder with cladding and leather was outrageous.

<b>Things change.</b>

Today, my household has an Infiniti I30t and a Toyota Highlander, a car-based SUV. Recently, the I30t went for its 1 year servicing; in its place, the dealership provided a 2001 Infiniti QX4 2WD as a loaner. The use of the QX4 was an opportunity to compare it to its luxury car sibling, the I30, as well as the Highlander (a very close sibling of the Lexus RX300).

<b>Appearance</b>

The first thing I noticed was how attractive the 2001 QX4 looks compared to previous years' models. While the fundamental design hasn't changed since its introduction, Infiniti has made a couple of important modifications. 

The front end, cladding, and rear hatch have all been simplified to look less fussy. In front, the QX4 now sports Xenon headlamps behind larger clear lenses that make the still-large fog lamp assembly seem better proportioned. The headlamps have an auto-on/off feature and are height-adjustable with a switch located on the dashboard.

In addition, the QX4 I drove had 17-inch wheels, which are included in the optional Premium Package. The larger wheels (16-inch rims are standard) make an enormous difference and, by themselves, are well worth the moderate cost of the option package.

Parked next to the Highlander, the QX4 looked massive and aggressive, mostly due to its higher ground clearance, taller overall height, and wider tires.

<b>Driving</b>

With 240 horsepower and 265 lbs of torque, the QX4's 3.5 liter V6 is more than adequate given its size and weight. Power delivery was silky smooth, and it was very easy to exceed the posted speed limits without even trying. Of course, the I30 and the Highlander V6 are no slouches in the engine department either, so anything less in the QX4 would have been a disappointment.

The best way to appreciate the smoothness of the QX4 (and the Highlander) is to drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I had the opportunity to drive one last summer and was appalled by its lack of refinement.

The QX4 is equipped with ABS and -- surprising in a luxury SUV -- a front disc/rear drum combination. In normal stopping, the brakes felt a bit touchier than my Highlander's disc/disc combination.

Road and engine noise are slightly more intrusive on the QX4 than the I30, and about equal to the Highlander. The QX4 rides firm, but really not much more so than the I30t with its low-profile 17" tires and sport suspension.

<b>Interior</b>

After stepping up into the QX4 (and carefully avoiding the almost useless side steps), it's easy to forget you're in an SUV and not the I30. 

Almost everything available in the I30 is also present in the QX4. This includes leather-appointed, power front seats; Bose audio system with CD changer; auto climate control; compass; electro-luminescent gauges; and, of course, the signature Infiniti clock. The optional Premium Package also included wood trim on the steering wheel and two memory settings for the driver's seat. 

At first glance, the rear seat of the QX4 seemed less roomy than the Highlander, and much less so than the limo-like back seat of the I30. A quick comparison at Edmunds.com confirmed my initial impressions. Notably, the Highlander (and RX300) has a 4+ inch advantage in rear leg room. In fact, the QX4 is smaller than the Highlander in all interior dimensions except for front leg room (by a 1-inch margin). Also, the rear door's narrow opening made entry and exit a challenge in tight quarters.

A minor quibble: the center position in the rear seat has a lap belt only, and also lacks a headrest. 

Interestingly, the QX4's dashboard appeared to have come straight from a Pathfinder, with the Infiniti-only elements inserted. For example, the Infiniti's analog clock goes where the Pathfinder's digital clock is normally located. However, the Infiniti clock is round and the space is square, so Inifiniti surrounded the clock with plastic "filler" to fill the space.

Compare this to the I30's dashboard which, well sharing some elements from the Maxima, was obviously customized where appropriate (the dash is shaped around the oval clock, for example).

<b>Value Analysis</b>

Bottom line, the QX4 is around $5,000 more than a comparably equipped I30. The 2002 I35 is an even better value than the 2001 I30 with a more powerful engine, Xenon headlamps and 17-wheels now standard (previously, the last two were only available on the more expensive I30t).

A value comparison with my Highlander is a bit more difficult. Fully equipped, it lacks some luxury features (such as a power passenger's seat) found on the RX300 and QX4. Still, the Highlander provides 90% of the luxury and matches the utility, for a much lower price tag. 

For what it's worth, my nicely equipped 2WD Highlander V6 with a cloth interior stickered for about $9,000 less than the QX4 I drove. A fully loaded 2WD model with leather would be about $6,000 less. This isn't a good comparison as the Highlander and QX4 are arguably targeting different audiences. However, if all you're looking for is the high ride and utility of an SUV, there are much less expensive alternatives to the QX4.

So is the SUV premium worth it? That's something you'll need to decide. If you're set on spending $36K on a luxury SUV that looks aggressive and feels great inside, the QX4 is definitely one to consider.
