            I've been doing photography for 25 years, mostly with 35mm SLRs.  I own 2 Nikon F2 cameras and 8 Nikkor lenses, and have always been a "Nikon man".  This company has products which, in my opinion, are far superior to all but the most expensive (German made) cameras, and in any event Nikon cameras are UNEQUALED in durability and flexibility.  Next time you see a newspaper photographer, you will probably notice he/she is using Nikon equipment.  That's no accident.  Nikons stand up to abuse better than anything else.

I bought the CP5000, first, for the 5 megapixel feature.  As a long time user of Nikkor lenses, I am used to outstanding image quality, and I demand it in my  photography. I have found that this camera delivers it, when I use it within its limitations (more on that later).  Also, as I mentioned, the Nikon name means quality to me, and I haven't been disappointed with the 5000.

The first thing I noticed when I anxiously opened the box for the first time is that this camera is TINY.  Almost too small for my liking, as I am a big guy with big hands, but I got used to it.  Moreover, as I am used to the heavy, all-mechanical F2, it was disconcerting to take a picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home, but this, too, I got used to.  An F2 with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to 5 pounds, depending on the lens used.  This is definately no F2.

The technology that went into this camera is nothing short of amazing.  I cannot believe the things it can do, and the flexibility of modes of operation is impressive.  In this respect, this camera is every bit a Nikon.  A lot of the features are probably availiable on other digital cameras in the same price range, but I was used to a mechanical camera, so I was impressed.

The lens is excellent, although I am somewhat disappointed with the edge sharpness in extreme close-ups.  Please keep in mind, however, that I am used to using high end, professional quality lenses.  The flexibility of the CP5000 lens is such that it cannot do everything equally well.  The very fact that this is a 3X wide to tele zoom, that can focus to 3/4", is amazing.  It is unfair to compare it with my 55mm f/3.5 Micro Nikkor.  While center sharpness is outstanding, if you intend to do a lot of extreme close ups, don't expect it to perform like a dedicated close up lens.

Some things that I like:

* The incredible image quality, and I am a VERY demanding user in that respect.  The 8X10 prints I produce with this camera get a lot of comments like "That's a digital camera?  Wow!"

* In spite of my initial reservations about the small size, I can put it in my pocket and take candids of my drunk friends at the bar.  I can't do that with an F2.

* The abundant features, like multi-mode auto exposure, white balance preset (you set the white balance by reading a white card, which makes it possible to have a perfect setting in ANY light conditions.  Very cool).  Also, manual focus override is useful for extreme close ups.  This camera does more stuff than 95% of users will ever need, but whatever your requirements, you will find features that make you say "Wow, that's cool!"

* This camera has a solid feel.  The body is made of magnesium, and in spite of it's tiny size, it has a nice heft.  You can tell it's not a plastic camera.

* The swiveling LCD screen is great for shooting at waist level (or other strange positions).  Great for candid photography.

Some complaints:

* The flash sensor is placed in just about the worst spot imagineable for someone with big hands.  It's easy to get used to if you use the camera regularly, but if I hand it to someone else I have to warn them to keep their fingers out of the way.  

* The autofocus is slow, so if you pick up the camera and try to "grab" a quick shot, you sometimes miss it while the camera focuses.  If you prefocus the camera by half-pressing the shutter button, however, there is almost no shutter lag at all.  This is a lot better than other digital cameras.  This point deserves some discussion; I notice that many reviews say that this camera has no shutter lag at all, while others say thet the lag is unacceptable.  This camera does not have shutter lag - it has autofocus lag.  There is new firmware (that I have not installed yet), that is supposed to improve autofocus performance.  I hope it helps.

That's about all.  It is a fact that no matter what camera you buy, something better will be availiable in a few months that will be better, and the one you bought will be availiable for a couple of hundred dollars less.  Overall, I'm happy with the CP5000.  The quality and features are worth the money.
