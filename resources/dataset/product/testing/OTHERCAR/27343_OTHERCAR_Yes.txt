            I bought a Dodge Durango because I was tired of minivans. Since living in Syracuse New York where we average 114 inches of snow per year I thought a four wheel drive vehicle made sense. My wife was the primary driver but we both enjoyed it so much we leased a 2nd Durango. My wife's is a 98, mine is a 1999. We both have the SLT Plus package. The 98 has the trailer package. This has all the heavy duty equipment. Both vehicles ride smooth.  The 98 with it's towing package rides a little stiffer.The 99 came with leather seats and they are softer than the regular fabric seats. Both have the top of the line Infinity sound system. Shifting into 4wd drive is just pulling a lever. That's all there is to it.Another reason we bought the Durango's  was because we did not want to follow the Jeep crowd. You get a lot more vehicle for less money. Currently there are 4 Durango's in our extended family. My daughter will be the 5th when her Jeep lease expires. The only &quot;NEGATIVE&quot; is gas mileage. We both get about 15 mpg. Both have 318 ci engines. I would recommend a Durango for anybody looking for a Suv.<br><br>
