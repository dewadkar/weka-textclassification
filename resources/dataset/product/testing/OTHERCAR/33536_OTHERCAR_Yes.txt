            I didn't set out to buy a New Beetle when I found myself in need of a new car. In fact, I was looking for cars a couple of thousand less than than mine. But I decided to drive one on a whim, just because I'd liked them since I first saw them -- and I came out of the test drive with a grin on my face. <i>That</i> was something that hadn't happened with the other cars I was looking at!

Before I got my Beetle, I'd been driving an old Volvo, and when I was looking for a new car, I wanted one with 4 doors. Nevermind that.

From the moment I got into the Bug I was impressed with several things. One, the height of the view -- you sits surprisingly high for such a small car. Two, the roominess of the interior -- again, a surprise for such a small car! Third, I loved the solid <b>thunk</b> the doors made as I closed them. It just felt safe and solid, and it handled excellently, even on the wet roads I test drove it on. 

So how could I resist?

One thing I have found is, even with my base-level engine, the car likes to go fast. I hit 80-90 on the highway without even realizing it (so I have to be careful!), because one you get the automatic transmission going, it keeps going. I haven't had a single problem in the 8 months I've had the car, not even an extra rattle. 
Plus, they're some of the safest cars on the road. They're all standard with air bags and antilock brakes. And those brakes work -- I've stopped the car too quickly before. The crash tests are excellent, and I have friends who have totaled theirs, and walked away with nothing but bruises.  

Add to this reliability the sheer fun of these cars -- you definitely get attention when you drive them, especially if you have a flashy color (the yellow loaner I had was actually more fun than my own silver.) They're loaded up with options, too.

My only complaint is that the cup-holders are inconvenient -- beneath the dash! -- and small, so anything larger than a soft drink can is tough to put in there. The wide dash takes getting used to, but after a while you're claustrophobic in any other car, with your head almost touching the windshield.  There are some blind spots, but you get used to those and learn to look around them. It's a little expensive, but the car is also not meant to be an economy car.

My car was, technically, used when I bought it due to a mix-up at the dealership -- but with all of 600 miles on it when I got it and in the new model year, I lost only half of the 10 year/100K mile power train warranty (not a problem since I have the car for 4 years) -- and got to keep the rest of the generous warranty that comes with the car, including the service agreement, as well as get new-car financing. 

All in all: they're great fun, a joy to drive and, in the end, well worth the expense.
