            I needed a car back in 1998 and didn't have a whole lot of money to spend.  I kept seeing the commercials for this cute and sporty car that would say &quot;Hi&quot; (remember the commercial...).  Anyway, I test drove the car and found it to be fun, quick and comfortable.  I ended up purchasing a sports package for the highline sedan.  Not much but a spoiler, better tires and sound system for the car.  

The second day I had the car, the ignition coil broke.  They immediately replaced it, thank god for warranties.  Time after time, the car had problems, it had been into the shop 11 times within 3 years for problems.  None were the same problem.  

The last straw was when the head gasket blew at 36K miles.  In my opinion, when you purchase a new car, you really should only need to change the oil and brakes. 

I thought that perhaps it was my bad luck that I bought a car with constant problems, but  I know at least 3 others that have the same model year and many different problems.

It is too bad there were so many problems with the car because it was a zippy, cute car.<br><br>
