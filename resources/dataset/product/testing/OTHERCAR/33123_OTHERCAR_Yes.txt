            If you are looking for a speedy sportscar, do not read this review.  If you are looking for a great towing package, do not read this review.  However, if you are looking for a great value for your dollar in a great family sedan, please read on.

I leased my 2000 Chevy Malibu LS in September of 1999.  The car still rides as quietly and smoothly as the day I drove it off the lot.  

<b>DRIVING EFFICIENCY</b>
The MPG 26 in the CITY is overestimated.  My job is in a metropolitan setting and 80% of my driving is city driving.  I have averaged between 23 and 26 MPG.  HIGHWAY MPG is another story.  The estimated is 31 MPG.  I have gotten at LEAST 31 MPG on my highway miles.  I try to drive no faster than 70 on the highway.  This is not only because of the speed limit, but the Malibu tenses up at higher speeds.  The steering wheel has a noticable vibration.  My advice: get Cruise Control and don't worry about it!  (The cruise control devices located on the steering wheel pad, not on the steering column, make for a very relaxing drive)
<b>DRIVING EFFICIENCY RATING = ****-1/2</b>

<b>DRIVING COMFORT</b>
Keeping in mind that the Malibu is best-suited as a family sedan, the fact that the passenger seat has manual controls while the driver's seat has automatic controls is somewhat disappointing.  I do most of the driving so this is not a major concern, but if your driving is with two or more adults in the front, the passenger lumbar support may be a bit too much to endure on long trips.  The rear seat allows two to sit VERY comfortably, three if necessary, though inconvenient and not as comfortable.  If you have children, the rear seats have wonderful child safety harness locks above the seat.  Their importance cannot be overstated.  I carried my nieces in the back seat and the added safety of top shoulder straps is insurmountable.  
<b>COMFORT RATING = ****</b>

<b>ATTITUDE</b>
I'm 24 years old and recently married.  I'm also in a career that requires a note of professionalism.  With that said, the 2000 Chevy Malibu LS was right up my alley when searching for a vehicle that has family value as well as a classy look and feel.  I've told you how I feel about driving comfort and efficiency.  But let's get down to it.  I'm a 24 year old guy, who wants a value of course, but needs the thrill of driving.  I drove the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, but the Malibu edges them both out with added V6 power (more HP than Accord and Camry), and the get-up-and-go isn't bad either.  First off the line, the Malibu doesn't jerk, but after a second delay or so, the overdrive kicks in and before you know it, you're pushing red on the tachometer and the rest of the line is rear-view only.  

I mentioned the tachometer.  The Malibu LS model comes standard with sporty features like that (the typical Chevrolet Stereo controls may get boring after some time, unless you get the optional CD/CASS/AM/FM stereo).  My favorites are the lighted in-dash controls.  Don't worry about running low on any engine fluids (including gas) because the Malibu lets you know in advance both with light warnings and low tone warnings (granted, they do get annoying if you don't get around to refilling your washer fluid for a few days).  The 2000 Chevy Malibu LS is the kind of car I can proudly show off to my friends at the golf course or at work.
<b>ATTITUDE RATING = ****</b>

<i><b>Bottom line is this:</b></i>

The 2000 Chevy Malibu LS is a great car for the money.  It may lack in sportiness or design compared to the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.  Put that aside, and you have a great family sedan, with great expected longevity, low maintenance, and a lot of what you need and want in a modern sedan.  I know that sounds cliche, but the 2000 Chevy Malibu LS is really worth every penny.
