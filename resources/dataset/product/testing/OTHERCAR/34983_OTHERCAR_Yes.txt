            In August of 1999 my 1989 Olds Ciera decided to encourage me into buying a new vehicle.  I would have bought a new Ciera, but since Oldsmobile discontinued this model, I was forced to search for a different car. My first priority in a new car was having the gear shift on the column versus the floor.  It is becoming very hard to find this option! I settled on the Buick Century after driving various models.  My reasons were style, ease of use of various controls, and of course a good rebate. For a car that is associated with older drivers the Buick Century presents a car that to me looks &quot;racy&quot;.  The sleek rear design provides both a good look and probably better aerodynamics for cruising down the road.  The engine provides good horse power and the steering is tight and responsive.  Inside the car the designers provided easy access to the climate controls, radio, and you can add on a CD player if you wish. On the downside, the seats are a little too hard and the cup holders are designed without a solid bottom that allows condensation to drip on your seat.  Gas mileage does average around 21 City and 31 highway. There is plenty of room in the trunk for storing many items. The Century is probably a family car, but I am single, and I enjoy it just as much.<br><br>
