            Hi all, I bought a brand new 98 Jeep Grand Cheeroke Loredo. Man, what an SUV. Brand new and ready for the heavy winter! Unfortunately, most of my experiences with this SUV have been negative. Let me tell you this much, I had to have the transmission replaced 3 times! 3 times in under 28k miles! Absolute lemon. It needed a complete (replace all 4 rotors and pads)brake job after only 20k miles. I am not an 'off roader' I drove this to my place of work, and took it out for occasional weekend trips. The service I got from my local Jeep dealer was substandard at best. I would beg anyone who is considering a purchase of a Grand Cheeroke to lease it, or if it is used, run the VIN # to see about service records.

Nice truck when it would run, lots of storage, comfortable for the front passengers. A/C, Radio, CD, Storage compartments were all nicely tailored and worked as expected, with the AC exceeding expectations.

The ride is more like a heavy duty car than a truck. This suited me just fine. It was nice to be able to just go over that mound of snow at the end of the driveway from the plows.

Bottom line, check the facts. I got screwed, and I am now the proud owner of a new 4x4, known simply as Quattro, provided by the Audi A6.<br><br>
