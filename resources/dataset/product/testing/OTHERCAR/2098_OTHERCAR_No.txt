            On the surface, this seemed like a great buy.  I bought a used 90 Sunbird GT (manual transmission) about a year and a half ago.  The price was great and the car seemed to run smoothly.  After about 4 months though, I began to spend quite a bit on maintenance.

Admittedly, this car is 10 years old, but I didn't expect to have to replace two gaskets, the entire exhaust system, the battery, and the alternator so soon.  It also needs brake servicing which I'm about to do next week.  When the car is not being serviced, it runs well.  You don't get the full effect of the turbo engine primarily because it is still a 4 cylinder car.  It's good on gas and provides adequate room in the front, but little or no leg room in the back.

It's still a nice buy for a student such as myself, although I would have hoped not to have had to spend so much in maintenance.  The parts for the turbo model are also more expensive, and harder to come across.  Also, there is very little space under the hood for the engine and its other components.  Everything fits so snug that it makes it a chore to service it yourself.  Overall, it's a decent buy, but by no means a steal.<br><br>
