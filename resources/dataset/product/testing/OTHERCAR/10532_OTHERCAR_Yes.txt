<b>Strengths</b>: Turbocharged engine is incredible. Excellent handling due to HICAS 4-wheel steering and adjustable suspension stiffness. Looks are top notch. The 2-seater coupe model's interior is surprisingly comfortable. More reliable than most sports cars. Overall excellent engineering, fit and finish. Available on the used market for much less than retail price. 


<b>Weaknesses</b>: Rear visibility is poor. Right-rear and and left-rear visibility is absolutely abominable. It doesn't break often, but replacement parts can be expensive when it does. Brakes are weaker than they should be. The retail price for a new one is severe. This being a sports car, gas mileage is not great. The stock stereo system (Bose) is silly, you'll probably want to replace it with something better. You'll probably get lots of speeding tickets driving this car. ;]

 
<b>Overall</b>: If you can afford the care and feeding, this is quite possibly the best balanced sports/GT car yet made. It isn't always cheap to maintain (though a lot of the time, it is). And beware, if the oil hasn't been changed religiously, and the necessary maintainence hasn't been done to the car, they can destroy themselves fast (especially the turbo models).

However, if you can find a well-maintained used one, this car will reward you with incredible performance, reliability, excellent looks, an interior (at least in the coupe) that is probably the most comfortable sports car interior ever made, all at a price that's not terribly much more than a new econobox. Get a 1994 or later model, and you'll also get luxury perks like keyless entry. And I won't even get into how easily you can modify this car for some truly insane horsepower.

Anyone who likes sports cars will love this car. I wholeheartedly recommend the car itself. I would only caution that you should be prepared to pay for the maintainence and gasoline. A full-time job is probably a necessity.
