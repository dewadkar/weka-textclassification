            Well I bought my Alero in Jan. 99 and at first was very happy with the purchase.  For the first little while I had no problems with it until fairly recently.  Thank God for a warranty otherwise I would be broke now if it wasn't covered.  I've had to have the seat cushion replaced for the driver's seat twice already and I should be taking it for a thrid time but its just not worth it anymore and I guess because I'm the customer I'll have to suffer.  The A/C I've complained about before because sometimes when I have the A/C going on a hot day for some reason all this moisture leaks through the CD player and fogs up my CD's so it can't read them anymore and it just ejects them after a few minutes of playing.  There ain't nothing they did about that when I told them.  The speakers are already blown and the dealership just told me that they aren't meant to go as loud as I want to play...my question then is why did I purchase the "premium sound system" if it can't even perform to its potential. One of the back doors now is very difficult to open and I'll have to have that looked at pretty soon.  Here is the clincher:  When the engine was approximately 48,000 km's old, I had to have the engine rebuilt under warranty.  They didn't even know why they were rebulding it, they just told me it was toast (and obviously blamed me for it saying that I didn't get the oil changed often enough).  This was far from the case as I got oil changes before they were even scheduled with that car.  Well the car now has 58,000 km's on it and the warrannty expires in 2000 km's.  I'll pay someone to steal this sucker from me (joking)!!!!  Well anyways I should get going because I have to go deal with these antics at the dealership before the warranty expires. Don't be fooled by this car.
