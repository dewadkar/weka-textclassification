            As a college student and frequent traveler, I needed something to battle the winter weather in central PA.  Wanting a sport utility vehicle, I happened upon this Blazer at a Honda dealership.  I immediately fell in love with the genuine truck styling and straight forward design.  Apart from the exterior, the LT options package offers a well appointed interior with leather seats, CD player, and ceiling console.  I am also proud to say that I like the column mounted gear shifter (even though I am only 22 years old)!  It frees up a lot of space on the floor for such items as car phones or potted plants.  The seats are extremely comfortable and the cabin is very spacious.  Having 4 doors is also a big plus.  My 6'5'' roommate even volunteers to sit in the back seat because of the leg room and easy access.  I like the rear mounted spare tire, but it does limit visibility in the rear view mirror.  I don't think the problem is as bad as in newer Blazers though.      

The Blazer is extremely well behaved on the road.  It delivers a surprisingly smooth and confident ride especially on long trips.  Contrary to popular belief, it handles very well for a sport utility vehicle.  The factory Cooper Discoverers are a bit noisy however and the cabin could be quieter.  I have since replaced the Coopers with Pirelli Scorpion AT's and the road noise has been significantly reduced.  

I am particularly impressed with the Blazer's automatic transmission.  It is extremely smooth and refined for a truck.  The push button, shift on the fly 4 wheel drive engages quite smoothly.  The Vortec 4.3L CPI engine is at home in all driving conditions whether it be city, highway, or off-road.  It gets relatively good mileage for an SUV.  I am, however, a bit disappointed with the engine's acceleration and low end torque.  It is also somewhat noisy.  

The ABS brakes have proven to be a somewhat annoying feature.  They have always felt &quot;spongy&quot; and require more force than other power assisted brakes.  I have been in several situations where the ABS kicked in and was quite frankly, scared to death.  I think that they actually increase breaking distance.  I don't know about newer generation ABS brakes, but I could do without mine.  

Overall though, the Blazer is a solid vehicle.  I would recommend it to just about anyone that wants the durability and practicality of an SUV without having to sacrifice car-like handling and refinement.  <br><br>
