            I don't actually own this car myself, but my mom does and I get to chill in it quite a bit.  The one we have is diesel so it gets 50 miles to the gallon.  Also, because its diesel its engine makes a real kick-ass noise when you rev the engine at a stop light.  The new diesels get much better acceleration than the older ones (our family also had a 1991 Jetta) but they still fall short of a lot of cars.  After 80 the speedometer seems to crawl and it is rare that I can get this car much over 100.  Also, the plastic molding in the Jettas seems to fall off and break a lot.  I don't know if we were just unlucky, but both of our Jettas had problems with this.  Anyway, this car still looks great and can help you attract mad chicks.  This is really useful if you have a dull or obnoxious personality because you are going to have to keep the ladies from focusing on your personal defaults.  <br><br>
