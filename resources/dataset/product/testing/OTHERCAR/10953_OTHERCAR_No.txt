            I have owned other BMW's in the past without many problems so I decided to buy a new 2000 323I to replace my 528I. 

Here is my first complaint: Here is a new car with only 22,149 miles on it and my brake warning light comes on. I take my car to my dealer to find out what was wrong.

They came back with an estimate that I would need new pads and rotors. I can understand brake pads but not rotors on a car that new with low miles and under warranty.

After many conversations with my dealer and BMW North America they would not replace rotors under warranty!

I would expect a car company like BMW to stand behind their products and satisfy their customers if their car is under warranty.

Now here is the kicker I had the work done and found out the replacement rotors are made in MEXICO! What has happened to BMW German quality? If I wanted a cheap car made in MEXICO I would have bought a VW JETTA!

After reading how many people are disillusioned with the quality and service form BMW I have to voice my concern.

Anyone want to start a list of owners who are having the same problems and go after BMW so we can get them to stand behind their products and get satisfaction!

Unless I get better support from BMW and their dealers I will not recommend or by their product in the future.

Update July 19,01

I finally received a letter form BMW North America telling me even though I have a new car under warranty that they will do nothing about this!

I would never expect this attitude from BMW after all I thought they were the best car company in the world.

This will make me think twice about purchasing another or recommending them to anyone.

I have never been a fan of American or Japanese cars but I will probable purchase a Lexus or Infinity next time around!

Update December 20,01

Well the problems continue!

I am driving home on the freeway when all of a sudden my car starts to lose power and transmission and warning lights going off like crazy.

I barley make it off the freeway and have to be pushed off the road by the CHP!

I get towed to my local dealer. It takes them two days to complete my car.

The problem was traced to FAULTY GASOLINE SENDING UNITS. MY GAS TANK WAS SHOWING MORE GAS THAN WAS AVAILABLE! 

I have lost total respect for BMW their dealers and service. I really would think twice before buying any BMW product I am!
