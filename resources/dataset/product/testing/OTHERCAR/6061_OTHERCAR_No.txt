            I bought this camera for because of the price, and keep in mind that "You get what you pay for", and this camera certainly proves that and is worth the price ($90), but if you want better picture quality I would recommend spending $100 or more on a more decent digital camera.

I would recommend this camera to kids or anyone who doesn't really care about the quality of the picture. I use it just for fun, like taking pictures of my friend�s or me and then using Adobe Photoshop (no photoshop is not included with the camera) to morph the pictures into fun things. It is also good for internet or e-mail because quality doesn�t really matter when I just want to show a picture of my new car to a friend across the country or if I want to show someone that I just met in Australia what I look like, In other words its not recommended if you want to print out these pictures.

This camera doesn�t take good pictures at night unless your 2 to 3 feet away from the object, and if your too close it will glare. I did notice that most pictures I have taken are a little grainy, but it helps a lot if you hold really still or use a tripod. I still have yet to take a perfect picture with this camera. 

The battery life is pretty good, I can take about 100 pictures with flash before the battery dies, and USB is very fast. It's really cool after installing the software because it adds a little Shortcut to your camera in "My Computer", so all you do is plug-in your camera after taking pictures and then click on the icon for your rca camera in my computer, and presto you can see your pictures in JPG format. You can also hook up the camera with the provided rca jacks to the back of your TV and view the images on your TV.

So basically what I�m trying to say is this is a good camera for $90, but it lacks good picture quality and a zoom feature, this is a good camera if all you want to use it for is to send pictures via e-mail, or to post pictures on the web. If your thinking about getting it as a gift for a beginner or a teen then go for it, but if you want it for yourself and want to take pictures of things you want remember forever then look elsewhere, this camera is most definitely not for you. Good Luck�
