            When my wife went shopping for a digital camera she had 2 requirements.   First of all, she wanted something small enough to take everywhere.  Second, she wanted something that was easy to use.  At the time we had a 3-year-old Sony DSC S70 that we enjoyed immensely.  It took outstanding pictures and never gave us problems.  But she hated to take it on outings because it was just too bulky.  We came across the 2 MP DSC U30 at our local electronic store.  We were fascinated by its miniature dimension and style.  We liked it so much, that we purchased one last summer. 

<b>What&#146s in the Box?</b>

DSC U30 Camera
8MB memory stick
USB (1.1) cable
Utility/Software disk
2 AAA NiMH batteries w/external rechargeable adapter
Instruction Manuel
Neck Strap

The camera&#146s ease of use makes it inviting to a beginner.  It&#146s entirely a point and shoot camera.  There are only 2 resolution sizes you can choose from: 1632x1224(2 MP) and 640x480(VGA).  However this Sony is fairly flexibility because it has a generous set of features.  There&#146s 5 scenic modes: soft snap, illumination, twilight, vivid nature, and active outdoor.  Soft snap is basically portrait mode, while illumination is for night time portraits.  If you want to get artistic there are 4 picture effects: negative art, sepia, black and white, and solarize.  And if junior is running across the hall, burst mode is available.  This will let you take 5 continuous shots in VGA.

<b>Performance</b>
For such a small camera the U30 takes terrific pictures.  What good is style and portability if it took bad shots?  Yes I&#146m proud to say our little Sony&#146s image quality is quite good and is perfect for standard 4x6 prints.  Images come out clear and colorful.  The built in flash works well in dimly lit rooms, as long as it&#146s within its limits. Battery life is good and you can use regular AAA batteries for backup.      

<b>Size</b>
The camera is a little larger than a pack of chewing gum.  Put in your pants pocket and you won&#146t even feel it&#146s there.      The U30 is quite a conversation piece at a get-together.   It receives all the compliments, while my fantastic 5mp DSC V1 (replaced S70) hardly gets a second look!

<b>Cool Discoveries</b> 
The mirror on the lens cover is nifty.  It helps with composing yourself for self-portraits.  We were a little weary that it didn&#146t have an optical viewfinder, but the LCD screen is bright.  It&#146s visible even on sunny days.  For pc transfers the U30 and V1 can use the same USB cable.  This was a pleasant discovery and I just got a free spare cable!   

<b>Dislikes</b>
The main drawback is a lack of an optical zoom.  If you want to take a picture of a distant subject you&#146re going to have to walk closer to it.  I'm not sure you can put a lens that zooms out on a camera this small.  For our needs its a small price to pay for instant portability. The flipside is I have misplaced the camera on a few occasions.  What can I say?  I'm an expert at losing small objects..lol!  
  
Red eye is a problem with small cameras, and the U30 is no different.  Even with red eye reduction on, my wife&#146s beautiful light brown eyes turn out red.  

The 1x digital zoom is a waste of time.  It can only expand the center of the picture.  You can&#146t scan diagonally or up and down.  I don&#146t like this feature on ANY camera, so this weak point doesn&#146t concern me.

The movie mode option is limiting.  You can only record 15 seconds at a time and there&#146s no volume.

The included 8MB memory stick will hold around 14 shots.  You probably want to invest in a larger one, note that the U30 is compatible with the new Memory Stick Pro (expensive).  I use a regular 32MB stick that can store about 60 images which is more than enough.  

<b>Parting Shots</b>
The U30 met are needs perfectly.  It&#146s so small, that we take it everywhere.  We never have those &#147I wish I brought my camera&#148 moments any more!   With its flat learning curve, beginners will be comfortable using it.  We bought the camera when it first came out for $200 last summer.  They should be down in price now, especially since the DSC U40 is set to replace it soon.
