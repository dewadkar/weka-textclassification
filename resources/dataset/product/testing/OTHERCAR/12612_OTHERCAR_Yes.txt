            Not me!  That was my primary reason for purchasing this camera.  I wanted to carry around something with me that took great pictures, didn't require film, and could fit in my pocket more or less.

Luckily, a co-worker purchased this same camera before me and let me test drive it for a weekend.  I loved it!  I took pictures using the medium size (1280x1024) and medium compression and when I received my prints from ofoto, I was in awe...they were indistinguishable from film!  I'm not a trained pro or anything, but that doesn't matter to me.  I just wanted great prints that I could send to my parents and friends.

I've been to China four times in the past year, not to mention many miscellaneous excursions in the Western U.S. and have found the camera to be a great traveling companion.  It's a great tool to preserve memories.  While I love my S10, it's not without it's flaws.

First, I had to buy the battery and charger separately.  They kit cost me about $75 if I remember correctly...not very cheap.  Also, you are unable to get a 2nd battery separately...you have to buy another charger (I haven't checked in a while on this though).  Second, the shutter is kinda slow...there is very noticable delay from the time you press the button and the time the camera actually captures the image.  This is resulted in countless blurred images from letting people who are not used to the delay take pictures for me.  They end up snapping the picture and not realizing they had to wait an extra second for the camera to capture the image, start moving to return the camera to me...when I check the camera, the image is blurred.  Using the small screen, you can't always tell the image is blurred either...another downside.  My third major complaint is the zoom and the horrible digital zoom.  The zoom is only 2x and that really doesn't do much.  I'm used to a 250mm zoom on my old SLR and this is nothing close.  Luckily, I haven't had much occasion to use the zoom so it hasn't been too bad living with the zoom.  Oh and the digital zoom is not usable at all...it's slow and looks very bad.  The minor complaint I have is durability.  I'm not one to really pamper my electronics...especially trekking around China, but I've tried to take fairly good care of my camera.  The camera is still intact, the screen and body however are pretty scratched up.  I don't really care about this as long as the camera works...but some of you may.

After all the complaints, I've come to realize that this is a fairly first generation product, but a damned good one.  The negatives I pointed out above are far outweighed by the compactness and picture quality of the camera.  I couldn't be happier with this camera...well except if I could by an extra battery without another charger :)
