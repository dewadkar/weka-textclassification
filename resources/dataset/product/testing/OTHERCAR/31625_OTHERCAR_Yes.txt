            I have owned the Nikon800 for 4 months, my first digital, and have taken about 1000 shots. I bought the telephoto lens and power adapter with it, plus a couple of rings and a thin chain to hold the lens cap nearby. I am happy with the camera and have made some nice prints.  The 2 megapixels are enough for most 8x11 prints, I think. The main limitations have been the weakness of the flash beyond 5 feet and the delay of 3 secs between shots.  Of course, if you use the LCD the batteries die very soon, so I rarely use it.  I am a dinosaur, I still use the alkaline (4 AA's) since I can get 40 of those for $10 at BJ's/Costco. Sometimes I use the Nickel Hydride or NiCad but they don't last long at all. The lack of a USB port is inconsequential since you can get a USB reader device for $25. Get the Nikon800 at a bargain price since they are being discontinued.
