            I have just taken delivery of a 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS . I have looked at the lines between the hood, fenders, &amp; doors and they are very nice and don't have any gaps like they used to have. I ordered this car and from the time it was ordered it was at the dealers in 4 weeks. This car runs very good. It has 200 HP V6 3800 and the power is there if you want to hold the gas pedal down. The car handles very good on curves. The dual heat &amp; air condition system work very good. The heated seats work so good you won't turn them on high because it will burn your butt.The dash is full of gauges and very easy to read. The leather seats have a feeling that you are just floating along.The trunk space is so large you wont have trouble getting your stuff in it.I waxed the car after getting it and I did not find one flaw in the paint anywhere. I have a passenger seat that has the heat and also has the 6 way power seat as does the drivers seat and they both work very good.The radio in this car is one with CD and tape player with the 8 speaker system. If you get on a rough road the radio will move the volume up to take the rough road away.I have not found anything at all wrong with this car and I have been a mechanic for 30 years. It is fun to drive this car and it will run real fast but I try and stay at the speed limit.<br><br>
