            I will say for starters, that my husband replaced my 95 Ford Contour in November of 1999 with a 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager for the sake of our children and his head.

This is a standard minivan (one of the original).  Plymouth sells a really nice package to the fleet companies.  We bought our van used with 17000 miles and history of being a fleet vehicle.  Fleet vehicles are often used in a more controlled environment with well scheduled maintenance.  The manufacturer's warranty is often still in effect when purchased.  We bought ours for around 18K minus a good trade in, which included an extended warranty.

I like this van.  The price is substantially lower than comparable models like the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna.  The Grand Voyager is definitely roomier than the standard Voyager.  If knee room in the third seat is at all and issue, don't settle for anything less than the Grand size.  I like the way it drives.  They engine has nice pick-up for a V6.

We have had it in for a major repair.  While the extended warranty covered all but a 25 dollar copay, the malfunction was in the emissions system.  Basically, the van could not go over about 25 miles per hour.

Minor problems that I have noticed that irk me now and then:
The locking latch plates do not work.  I took the van to a car seat clinic to have the seats installed.  The guy tried them and said, sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.

The integrated safety seats (which are a big advantage) are rated for children over 22 lbs and under 40 lbs.  That range is not very large considering that several states now recommend keeping kids in booster seats until 60 lbs or more.  The seats are nice though, with a washable liner.  The latch doesn't click as loud as it used to either but it does hold tight.

The mat that wraps around the middle seat cannot be used with the middle seat in the "further back" position.

The seat belt on the middle seat is difficult to get around with a car seat installed on that side.


This is a very basic minivan.  While a lot of people have complaints, this a automobile.  Most automobiles need TLC and maintenance now and then.  This minivan retails for much lower than the other comparable models.  I appreciate that and a whole lot more.
