            I love my GTP!  For the money, this is an incredibly powerful vehicle with loads of electronic goodies.  I bought this car new in the middle of the 1998 GM strike (which cost a bit more than normal, but hey, I needed a car *then*) for just over $25,000.  The GTP has 240hp, 280ft/lb of torque at 2500rpm!  That's right, even with the excellent traction control system enabled, you can still squeal the tires off the line if you really want to.  The handling is supurb as well, especially for a car of this size.  Some people may say &quot;widetrack&quot; is just a marketing slogan, and I may be forced to agree with that.  But, I can accelerate through relatively tight cloverleafs attaining well over 50mph without any lateral tire squeal at all.  This car maintains control in extreme cornering quite well.  It is also equipped with Magnasteer, the magnetically driven variable-effort steering system pioneered by Cadillac.  This adjusts the turn rate so that it is just as easy to turn the wheel at 0mph as it is at 25mph or 70mph.  

As for cool electronics, there are plenty.  My favorite is the heads up display (HUD) which projects a digital speedometer, warning lights, fuel consumption and turn signals onto the windshield just below the drivers line of sight.  It also displays your radio station and CD disk number and track number.  If it had a compass and altimeter on the HUD it would look just like a fighter cockpit.  This is coupled with steering wheel mounted radio controls, which means you never have to take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel.  My car has a twelve disk CD changer in the trunk (the most disks for a factory installed CD changer that I've ever heard of), 8 speaker premium sound - very nice!  The antenna for the radio is integrated into the rear window, so there is no mast antenna to break off in a carwash or ice storm and no telescoping antenna to break either.  The rearview mirror is electrochromic so that it automatically dims at night if someone is following you with their high-beams on.  Speaking of headlights, the Grand Prix has a light sensor in the dash that automatically turns the lights on when it gets dark enough.  There is a trip computer that calculates fuel consumption, gas mileage, and range before you must refuel, as well as letting you know when you need to change the oil.  The climate control system is fully digital, with a continuous display of external temperature, as well as the dual zone control.  You can differentiate temperature as much as 30 degrees from driver side to passenger side.  With the Prado leather seats, the driver's seat is also heated.  This is SO NICE on cold days!  My only regret is that the passenger seat is not heated as well.  Mine also has remote keyless entry.  The only thing missing is a computer like KITT on Knight Rider to drive for you.

The car is beautiful and always turns heads (even more so being from a limited run of 1500 pace cars.)  Furthermore, the back seat of this coupe is larger than most luxury sedans - no joke.  It seats 5 adults comfortably.  I am 6'4&quot; and I can sit in the back seat just fine - not that I ever want to when the driver's seat is so much more fun!  It's a lot of fun smoking Mustangs and Camaros with my Grand Prix.  The only thing I see as a drawback (other than the fact that everyone wants to race) is the 91 octane requirement.  This is due to the supercharger on the GTP - the GT and the SE run just fine on regular 87 octane.  But the extra 12-14 cents a gallon is worth it for the g-force acceleration the supercharger provides.  Want a fun car for a great price?  <br><br>
