            In September, 1995, my wife and I bought a 1995 B2500 Conversion Van.  We bought it because we needed a vehicle to pull a boat since we are both fishermen.  Another reason was because we could remove the two middle chairs and we could use it as our camper also.  A plus that we now know, it is very comfortable to travel in.  

Since buying the van, we have made numerous fishing trips.  The V6 engine has plenty of power to pull our 19.5 VIP Fish and Ski boat.   It has plenty of power to pull the boat up some pretty steep ramps.  Since we have a trolling motor on the boat, we will stay in sites that have electricity.  I use an extension cord so that we can have lights and a coffee pot in the van.  

We have made several trips to the Gulf coast, a 675 mile trip.  It is very nice to leave on a Friday night and drive till we are tired and then sleep comfortably in the van.  Get up the next morning and go on to the coast.

Another one of our pass times is gambling.  Since we live in Texas, this means we travel to where we want to play.  We have driven to Louisiana, Colorado, and New Mexico.  Again the comfort of the van is very nice.  

The van now has over 117,000 miles on it.  Mechanically, we have had no trouble.  The van has only been in the shop because of a couple of accidents.  It is on its third set of tires.  

My wife and I are approaching retirement.  One thing that we will buy before retiring is a replacement Dodge van.  This one will last a while longer but we feel that we will need to buy at least one more.

Yep, I recommend the Dodge van.  It has been very dependable and comfortable.
