            The Audi 80 series is honestly the best car I have ever owned. If equipped with the quattro all wheel drive and anti-lock breaks, the car not only out-performs most other passenger cars, but is also a breeze to drive in very bad weather. The standard options include: 4 wheel disc brakes, pwr windows and door locks, air conditioning, power mirrors, rear window defrost, and 5-speed transmission. Available with: front or all wheel drive, 4 or 5 cyl. engine, heated and/or leather seats, ABS, wood grain int., alloy wheels, and tilt steering. On the downside, the car has a small trunk (not as bad as a Honda though.) And a weak seal in the transmission differential of the automatics makes them somewhat unreliable. Parts for this car are very hard to find and also expensive.
