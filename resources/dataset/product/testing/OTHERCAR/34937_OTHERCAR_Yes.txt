              We had a mini van, but outgrew it.  We camp and travel a lot and needed something with enough room for our large family, dog, and all that goes with that.  We wanted a 12 passenger, but needed the vehicle right away.  All that was available was the 15 passenger so we bought it.  
 The one thing I don't like is the vinyl seats.  They are not good when you live in the south.  However, this is an option you would choose when you purchase the van.
  Our van is 8 years old.  The only true mechanical problem we have this entire time is the metal lever for the AC/Heat unit shorted out.  It was inexpensive to replace.  Last year, 1999, the oil control in the dash board needed replacing.  This year the radio gave out, and the AC needs to be recharged.  Not bad for a van that has been in our house for 8 years.
 I love the room of this vehicle.  I was terrified to drive it at first, but soon became used to it.  It handles very well.  The controls on the dash are easy to reach.  Conversion parts are easy to find.
 Anyone with a large family, or those who need a lot of space, would do well with this vehicle.
