            I've had my 92 expo for 7 years now, and it's got l07k miles on it, and it t just runs and runs.  As another reviewer said, this may not be a great car for a family (which probably should just get a &quot;real&quot; mini-van, not a &quot;micro van&quot; , which is what this one is.  but it sure works well for a single guy with occasionally more than one passenger, who hauls around BICYCLES a lot.   I have taken out the middle seat &quot;permanently&quot;, and use the &quot;way back&quot; folding seats for the few passengers I have.  This car has a four-cylinder (important to the environmental crowd) and is no longer than a Honda Accord.  But the interior room is voluminous if you configure it the way I have.  Easy to park and gets 25-28 mpg in the days of the 70 mph speed limit.  What's not to like?    I take real good care of mine, because there is no car like it to replace it with.  I'm trying to hold out until SOMEBODY gets hip that this car fills a niche that is currently unfilled.
