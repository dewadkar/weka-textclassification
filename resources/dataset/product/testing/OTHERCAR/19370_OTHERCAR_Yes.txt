             I bought a 1991 Geo metro out of desperation. It was 2000 and the car had 151,000 miles when I bought it for $100 dollars from a Rancher and Postal Rural Route driver who used it to deliver mail. At first glance I was surprised it had made it up the driveway but I was in sore need for any transportation. Little did I know how tough that little car really was.
 At first I only used it to drive back and forth to work, not trusting it at first. Then came a test. For reasons I will not disclose I had to drive from Idaho Falls ID elevation 4,700 ft to a summer camp 210 miles away high in the Sawtooth mountains. Rough terrain all the way. To get to the camp I had to get over Galena Summit, elevation 8,000 ft and then some.
 On the way back I blew a tire at 65 mph and lost control of the vehicle, jumped a five foot embankment and landed in a mans yard digging two deep furrows with the tires. The miracle isn't that I'm alive. I was able to actually drive the car away. Only minor repairs were needed.
 For its next incredible feet, and after only a regular tune up and oil change the car got to Los Angeles, handled the traffic and my maniac driving for a week and made it home.
 This is a good car for around town with a safe driver at the wheel. <br><br>
