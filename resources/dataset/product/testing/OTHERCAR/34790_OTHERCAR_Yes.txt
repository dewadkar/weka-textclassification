            I have recently purchased a 2000 Montero Sport LTD., and I am very pleased ..so far. The ride is extremely comfortable, even on long trips. There doesn't seem to be much swaying in turns, that I have noticed in other SUVs that I test drove. Before making my decision, I priced and tested the Toyota 4 Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, and Chevy Tahoe. None compared to the Montero for price and options. The Limited version of the Toyota 4 Runner was priced thousands more than the Montero, but offered no additional options or value. I also found the Mitsubishi dealer ready to negotiate the price, unlike the Toyota, Ford, Nissan, and Chevy dealer.
The one negative that I have found, so far, is the transmission often makes groaning noises while still cold. I have reported this to the service dept., and will continue to monitor for potential problems.
All in all owning and driving the Montero Sport has been a pleasurable experience. Gas mileage is near 20MPG on the highway, and 16-17MPG in the city. The gas tank capacity could be larger to extend the range, but for day to day driving it is sufficient.
This is a lot of vehicle for the money, and the quality you would expect from a Japanese automaker appears to be present. <br><br>
