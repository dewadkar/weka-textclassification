            I have been using the DC260 for about 2 years and must tell you it's by far my greatest purchase. That says a lot for computer stuff that has a user life of 2 months. I'm a Graphic Designer and use the DC260 for web site photos and for posting eBay photos. 

When I was looking to purchase a camera this was the first Mega Pixel camera on the market. It has all the features you will ever need in a digital camera. Image quality is awesome, the best I have seen till this day. Don't buy a camera unless it has USB. Lightning fast downloads is the key to staying productive. 

Another cool feature is the digital voice recorder which you will use more than you think. Battery life is great. It's a tad bigger than most camera's but what's nice is it's commercial look and feel. When your standing in front of a client the last thing you want is to look like your shooting with an elf camera. 

I love this camera and will never part with it. It has already outlived my VCR, Camcorder, cordless phone, two computers, a scanner, and my syquest drive. By one you will be very happy.

One thing to keep in mind when buying a digital camera. Spend a little more it makes a HUGE difference. <br><br>
