            I owned a dodge stratus for four years.We bought the car brand new we were newly married and had a one month old baby.  I will say this is a great little car but that is just it, little. It worked perfect for my husband and I when we had one child but with a growing family you need a little more room.It is not to bad with two kids but if you never need anyone else to ride with you then it might just work. We had no problems with it. It never broke down and it even did great in fairbanks Alaska, where temperatures would sometimes get to 40 degrees below zero. It had a huge trunk and believe me we needed the trunk space. It was fun to drive it handled corners great and  it had a lot of pick up and go for a four cylender.  just remember if you are going to expand your family then this might not be the car for you. I really dont have any major complaints about the car. It is just that you spend so much money on a car that you should really make sure that you are getting what you want.<br><br>
