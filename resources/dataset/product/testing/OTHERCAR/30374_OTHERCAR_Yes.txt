            My lease was up on my 1998 'think different' SUV; a 10-mile-to-the-gallon, 6 times recalled, 8 times in the shop, still back-firing at trade in time status symbol.

It was apparent, it was time to search for a new vehicle. The good news, I had approximately three months to find the vehicle, the bad news, my last name isn't Carnegie or Rockefeller, nor are there any relationships through marriage through those names or those people. 

I spent a good three months researching replacement vehicles to no avail. 

At the dealer, I was looking at the pontiac mini-van, I needed versatility, convenience and functionality; everything a 37 year-old  outdoorsy type male with 2 young children dies to look at. Gone were the days of 70's muscle cars and 80's come-backs, nope, I was soon to be another Dad in a mini-van. Getting ready to sign the papers in defeat, I saw out of the corner of my eye a mad-max like vehicle with a tent stuck to the back of it.

Could this ugly duckling be the proverbial beautiful black swan?

Yes!

Pro's on outside:
The Pontiac Aztec GT model (1SC option package) was on display. Looking at the outside skin of the vehicle, I noticed some very intriguing and innovative features. I first noticed the lower charcoal body side molding / cladding wrapped around the vehicle, it comes up a good foot and a half and has integrated rub-strips; around here, road work is always being performed and I automatically thought that the goo on the road would no longer mar or chip or scratch the paint of the vehicle.  The paint and clearcoat seemed to be very well applied and 'thick', it seemed to have more paint than the other vehicles I noticed, I know this is probably an inaccurate statement, but it IS what I thought. I also noticed that the antenna was integrated in to the windshield, a plus around here with mischievous kids roaming around. The glass is deep tinted (rear of vehicle) for privacy. The turning lamps are mounted high on the front of the vehicle and high on the back of the vehicle. On- coming and behind-you vehicles will have no trouble knowing your intentions.  Headlamps and foglights are bright. I think the SRV looks cool from the front, this vehicle has 16 inch puncture sealing tires, with sporty aluminum 3 spoke rims. From the front the Aztek looks like it's kind of smiling at you, in a tough 'mad-max' kind of ominous way.
 
Con's on outside:
*No rear wiper
*Though this vehicle is equipped with the optional towing provision package,(3500 pound capacity, wiring harness, engine oil cooler, high output alternator, HD engine cooling system and an automatic air-leveling controlled shock system) it came without a trailer hitch ! I am not sure why Pontiac chose to omit this, I am in the process of determining if an OEM hitch is available.

Interior:
Pro's:
*The vehicle shines here. First let's discuss safety. I immediately noticed that the middle passenger in the back  seat has a shoulder harness assembly. I noticed that there are 4 airbags in the vehicle, two in front and two for side impact, integrated into the front seats.  There is also a safety cage for impacts built into the vehicle. Since I have two kids, their comfort is critical to their sanity and mine; there are child comfort guides built into each belt ( a true system for comfort)
* this is a big interior, great head room, leg room, hip room, ample room for all kinds of stuff, kids, dogs, camping and fishing and skiing equipment. The rear seats are light-weight, about 40 pounds and easily come out. This vehicle has a wider stance that the Durango, that 'think different' SUV.
* When entering or exiting the vehicle, the lights fade on and dim out, this is a nice feature.
* I would recommend the 1SC option package. The package comes with Plado leather seating (extremely comfortable, more comfortable than the hang-glide premium cloth). 1SC comes with dual zone air and heat, power outside mirrors, cruise, remote entry fobs, roof rack, traction control, power seat, leather wheel with funky stereo and CD control buttons on the wheel, vehicle theft system, a head-up display (really cool) and a sliding rear cargo tray (A MUST IN THIS VEHICLE) 
* There is a computer that monitors all kinds of things on this vehicle, gas, oil-low levels, traction control activation, light bulb burn-outs, all kinds of things, the display is large and clear.

* This vehicle had some other great options which included the (UC6)in-dash CDX receiver with AM/FM and multi-CD storage (6) with RDS, random disk search and function, speed compensated volume control, graphic equalizer, clock, Theftlock, and rear audio controls. 
*The system houses a Pioneer premium 10 speaker system, the rear speakers point outward of the rear of the vehicle, you can really hear the system well outside, believe me !!
* A power moon roof that cracks open or fully opens
* A tent with an inflatable air mattress, in fact you can inflate the air mattress with the built-into-the-vehicle air compressor!! This is a great feature of this vehicle, You can inflate bike tires, pool toys, footballs, soccer balls, heck, I used it to inflate my wheelbarrow tire today. The Aztek comes with a 20 foot hose that attaches to all kinds of devices.
* A hiking package that includes 2 backpacks that hook onto the front seats, vinyl seat covers for the front and back, (they fit tight and will help keep the car clean) and heavy duty mud catching floor mats.
* A reconfigurable cargo net: This gets in the way of the sliding tray, but I think the dealer added it to show potential customers all of the Aztek's goodies, I am using the net in my wife's vehicle.

Con's of interior
*Some Azteks have deleted the rear sliding tray. DO NOT buy one without the rear tray. It would be very tough getting stuff from the back of the car without the sliding tray. The tray holds 400 pounds and is a real life saver. I believe it would be too hard getting stuff out of the Aztek without it.
*The center armrest (An igloo style 6-pack cooler) is not easy to remove and put back in. It sticks a little. This is a minor issue
* Since this model has a sunroof, Pontiac has decided to delete the rear radio controller for passengers (not the rear radio buttons in the trunk) This controller allows rear seat passengers to listen through headsets to music OTHER than what the front passengers are listening. So let's say I am listening to NPR on the FM radio, the kids could be listening to any one of the 6 CD's in the cd player, they hear Barnie and other sing-a-longs, I hear NPR; this is a great concept, providing you DON'T have the sunroof.
*Rear cup holders are integrated into the door and can only hold smaller cups, it is very tough to get the drinks out of the rear cupholder, you almost want to open the rear doors to get to the drinks.
* There is no rear armrest, I would like to see an integrated armrest and cupholder, a welcomed parental feature in other SUV's.

I really love the economy of this vehicle, I get about 23 miles to the gallon in the city, that is 16 miles per gallon more than what I am used to. I do very little highway driving.

The vehicle drives like a Park Avenue, Caddy or a Lincoln, and I am willing to bet it has more goodies and function than any of those. It is very impressive and quiet.

If you like versatility with a mad-max look and James Bond type gadgetry with Swiss army like functionality, let's not forget at an incredible price, the 007 Aztek GT is for you.

In sum, I drive my black swan daily, to me, the rest of the vehicles are over priced 'under-capable' ugly duckings  !
