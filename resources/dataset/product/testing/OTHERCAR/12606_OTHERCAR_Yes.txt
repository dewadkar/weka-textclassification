            I  bought the Canon S10 digital camera about 3 months ago and so far it has been working OK! Now I don't have to worry about never taking the film in ( I only have 30 rolls waiting to go to the photo shop):-)

S10 comes in a 8MB CompactFlash card which can hold up to 12 large pictures (1600 x 1200) and it is compatible with the 340MB card and connects to your computer using a USB port; if you have a Window95 or Windows NT system, don't worry, it also comes with a serial cable though using it would really slow down the actual download speed. S10 is also very compact compared with many other digital cameras, which is an excent choice if you have limited space on vacations. The feature I like most about this digi cam is that it has its own slide show built-in which you can hook up to your television with another cable that is provided in the package. Plus some other feature including Black and White photographs, slow motion, red eye reduction, etc.

There are some problems that I have had: 
1. The software that is provided with the digi cam is very poorly put together and crashes alot.

2. The CompactFlash that is provided is TOO limited I would buy the 340MB card or buy a couple more of those 8MB cards.

3. S10 uses to much power, you will need to buy the recharger for around $100 because the Canon is so hard up to get more money, or you need to buy a dozen of those batteries at $12 each

3. 2x zoom is just not enough, you need at least 5x or greater...
