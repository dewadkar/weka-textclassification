            I guess you would say I am a convertible junkie.  Almost every car I have ever owned has been  a convertible.   There were a few years in the years during the 1970's and early 1980's when the car makers weren't manufacturing convertibles and I had to go with hardtops.

But in 1991 my Toyota, which was almost 10 years old had an electrical problem and the dealer told me it would take hours to find out what the problems were and at $45 an hour I didn't feel like paying four or five hundred dollars to find out something would have to 
be replaced.

I decided to go back to my first love a rag top.  There were only two makes I liked one was the Ford Mustang and the other was the LeBaron.  I like the young woman at the Chrysler dealership and felt she was trying to give me the best deal possible.  It was a comradery
of being single mothers and she didn't try to explain things that were way over my head.   I knew it was a v six engine, and that the gas tank held 16 gallons of gas.  It had four tires and I bought the warranty that would replace anything that went wrong with the car for seven years.  The first year the transmission started going bad.  I had heard on &quot;Hard Copy&quot; that Chrysler had bad transmissions during 1991.  The dealer acted like he had never heard of this.  I replied that I had taped &quot;Hard Copy&quot; and would be glad to make a copy for him.  I knew this was fake on his part.   They replaced the transmission.  

They were fair on keeping their word on the warranty, but I don't think they plan on customers keeping a car as long as I do.  They also have had trouble with pealing paint.  The dealer didn't seemed to be aware of this either.  Again, I offered to bring in my taped video of 20/20 who reported on this paint problem.  I couldn't help but joke with them about how uninformed they were about the defects that were been televised over the nation.  

I finally told them that I didn't know if I would want to do business again with dealers who didn't stay informed about the media's criticism of them.

AS far a the car goes, it still looks might good, the top is like brand new and it has a lot of get up and go.  Presently, it needs a new muffler and I have to replace two batteries, but I think that's pretty good for almost ten years.


I have replaced the tires once but I think it's been fairly maintenance free.  I change the oil every 3,000 miles and winterize it every other year.
There is nothing better than having the top down on a spring or a fall night and turning on the heater.  

The first nice spring day everyone want to trade cars with you.
