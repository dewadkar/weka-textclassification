            I bought my truck a couple of months ago because I have always wanted a truck. It had a little 4-cylinder in it, so I knew it would get good gas mileage. It does. I get about 25 miles to the gallon. 

My favorite part about the truck is the way that it looks. I think it is the best looking S-10 out of all of the other years I have seen. It isn't too square or too elaborate it is just an all around great looking truck. Also the interior is roomy for being a little truck. It can fit 3 people fairly comfortably and 2 extremely comfortably. 

There is only one problem with the entire truck and that is that it is making a tiny squeaking noise. The mechanics that I have taken it too said that it was squeaking because the owner before me rested his foot on the clutch. But besides that it is a great truck.

Anyone that wants a dependable, small, and nice looking truck should buy a '94 S-10.   <br><br>
