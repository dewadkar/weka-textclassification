            And I don't mean a nightmare.  You've seen all those Saturn commercials where the salesmen cheer for you after you buy a car?  They're not kidding.  I do have to say it was the nicest car buying experience I've ever had.  No pressure, up front pricing and accurate information.  We bought the basic model.  The only extra we added was air conditioning.  It still has good pickup going up a hill even with the a/c turned up.  We have a standard transmission.  It shifts well with a minimal amount of effort.  This took some getting used to after driving a pickup truck.  In addition to a tachometer it has a dashboard light that comes on when the car thinks you should shift.  I find this mildly annoying but easily ignored.  There are an adequate number of cup holders and cubbies.  Two of the back seat belts have a clip that adjusts the seatbelt for shorter passengers.  We fit two car seats and a skinny eight year old in the back seat with no problem.  It might be possible to fit three car seats but it would be more than a little cramped.  The trunk is reasonably spacious but not huge.  This is a great family car but I wouldn't buy it if you had a large family or older children who need a lot of leg room.  This is a fantastic car for the money.<br><br>
