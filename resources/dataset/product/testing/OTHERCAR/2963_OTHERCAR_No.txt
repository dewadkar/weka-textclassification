            I was told in my youth buying a vehicle in its first model year was a bad idea.  The Lincoln Navigator proved to be no exception.

I had worked myself into a frenzy to obtain this vehicle.  The Navigator, on paper, fit everything about me perfectly.

I ordered one as soon as I could, with all the extras.  I waited a few weeks, and then biggest SUV of my life finally arrived.  Or so I had thought....

The first week out, I obtained several door dings.  Wider vehicles get hit by doors more often.  My friends were still impressed by the vehicle though, and we had a some good road trips.

The comfort of the vehicle is unmatched.  I attribute this to the amount of space available, the four bucket seats, and the sound system.

The initial romance with the vehicle lasted only six months.  Then recall after recall I would drag my Navigator back to the dealership and be stuck in some rent-a-towncar for a day or two.

To this day, my tires slowly go bald on the outer edge.  The hydraulics seem to be slightly off and I feel like I am driving at a tilt.  I drive my Jeep Wrangler instead out of preference and save the Navigator for road trips.

Maybe this is all the fault of the dealership which services my vehicle.  Maybe the second or third year models have no recalls.

In any event, I wouldn't purchase another Navigator.  I would entertain ideas of an Expedition or go back to the sporty Jeep Grand Cherokee, but no more Lincoln Navigators for me.<br>
