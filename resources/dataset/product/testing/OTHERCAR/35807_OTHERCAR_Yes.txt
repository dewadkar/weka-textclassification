            I bought this vehicle because I needed dependable transportation and I loved all the great feedback from other Saturn buyers. 

I love that this car has a lot of leg room and enough seat for your behind to sit comfortably as a passenger in the rear of the vehicle.  I can also go yard sales and fit quit a haul due to the rear seats that come down, I was even able to get a 6' foldout table inside and still close the trunk.  Pretty impressive.

This car is fantastic to drive, its not too large and definitely not compact.  Its comfortable, roomy for passengers and drivers alike.  

Anyone looking for a great family car should think about buying a Saturn.  Anyone who is single should consider it as well its sporty but roomy and you can get more than 2 people inside.  Also insurance rates are very reasonable for this vehicle.
