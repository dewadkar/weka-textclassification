            my family recently invested in a new dodge caravan(1999) we got it late march since then it's gone through alot with our family. i find the minivan to be very reliable. not once has it stalled/broken down.it was well worth it's money. i find that this minivan has enough space for a large family and also great for a small one. it gets great gas mileage. and all the great stand features such as radio (AM/FM), A/C, automatic transmission removable seats (both rows), and much more every family that has kids should have.<br><br>
