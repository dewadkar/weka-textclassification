            This is my third digital camera. I compared the Nikon 5400 with the Sony DSC-V1 and the Cannon G5, before I bought. I picked the Nikon 5400 mainly because of the wide angle lens. I haven't taken a picture yet, where I needed a wider angle than the Nikon 5400 produced. The Sony V1 and Cannon G5 produce sharper pictures than the Nikon 5400, but they do not produce clearer pictures than the Nikon 5400. I can't detect any noise in pictures taken using the auto sensitivity mode (ISO's 50 to 160). 
Some shots like a soft focus (Nikon 5400). Some shots need a sharp focus to look best (Sony and Cannon). If I need an extra sharp picture, I will set the Nikon controls to High Sharpness and +1 Contrast. If the picture still needs more sharpening, I use Adobe Photo Deluxe 4.0 - Extensis auto sharpen tool, and that gives excellent sharpening results.
If you are going to take a lot of pictures outdoors, in the woods, this is where the Nikon 5400 does its best work. Increase the color saturation to +1 or +2, and you can produce a picture close to a painting.
The manual controls for this camera are very extensive.
The built-in flash has limited range - maybe 10 feet. But, you can attach a high power Speedlight to the top of the camera. 
I like the movies, with sound, this camera puts out; maximum length is 3 minutes. Movies play on the TV, on the computer, or on the camera.
How good are the pictures? Well, it is all in the camera settings. Do a perfect job in setting the controls, and the result will be in the 5-star category. Learning all the controls will take a non-professional a good bit of time to learn. There is a full auto mode, but why buy a prosumer camera to operate it in auto point-and-shoot mode?
