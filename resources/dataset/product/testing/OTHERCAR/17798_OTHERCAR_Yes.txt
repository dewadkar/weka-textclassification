            I purchased a 1998 Grand Marquis LS several days ago and I am truly enjoying it.  At first it seemed extremely large and tricky to handle but after a few days I adjusted and now I really love the car. 
I have been wanting a luxury car and the Grand Marquis is probably as close as I will come to owning a luxury car for quite some time.  I really like to color too, dark gray, I see a lot of these vehicles but rarely have I seen one this color, mostly I see the silver, green and red models.  I am still trying to get accustomed to the leather seats, 
depending on what I am wearing I tend to slide on the seat. 
The power seats are truly wonderful and one of my favorite features, I am extremely please with the rear view mirror that dims the bright headlights of the cars behind me - now I am more comfortable driving at night.  
I had the impression that mostly older people bought Grand Marquis but with its new design I think younger people may consider it, 

I am very glad that I did.  I expect to have good service with this car and I am looking forward to driving it for many years to come.<br><br>
