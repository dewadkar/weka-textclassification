            My husband and I once owned a 1993 Pontiac Bonneville.  It had its troubles, but it took care of me when I needed it to.

My husband and I wandered into an auto dealership one afternoon on a lark.  We thought it would be fun to look at cars, though we weren't the least bit serious about buying one.  

When we came across this hunter green beauty I was impressed.  I loved the spacious interior, it was one of the few cars I have ever seen that can honestly fit six adults comfortably.  Room is a precious commodity when you have a car seat and one on the way, as you often want to take other people along with you.

I liked the layout of the instrument panel, and all of the accessories (heater, wipers, radio, etc.) were within easy reach so you didn't have to take your eyes off the road.

What truly had me sold on this car was the trunk.  It was the largest trunk I had ever seen on a car.  I knew we would have more than enough room in it to carry all the luggage that goes with a family traveling with a baby.

Although we really didn't intend to purchase a car, my husband saw me fall in love with it and wanted to buy it for me.  Within a week I was driving a very nice car.

This car handled superbly for such a large vehicle, I was truly impressed.  I could visit the city (I am a country girl) and not have to worry about being unable to maneuver in traffic.

The only thing that really bothered me about the car is that the dash light were a bright red.  I know that this was intended to keep a driver from becoming drowsy while driving at night, but the color was hard on my eyes.

My long-last love for this car stems mainly from the night I lost it.  I was driving home one rainy night and one mile from my house I hit a black cow in the road.  I was driving less than the speed limit at the time--55 m.p.h. in a 65 m.p.h. zone.  

I hit the front portion of the cow with the the driver's side front of the car.  The front end was mangled beyond recognition, but the passenger compartment remained relatively untouched.

The cow's head hit my windshield.  The safety glass "spider-webbed" as it was supposed to, with only a small hole at the sight of the hardest impact.  Also, the beam that holds the roof of the car wasn't even dented.  Had that one beam given way I would have been crushed by the weight of the cow.

The cow's body swung around and hit the rear, driver's side door.  It  mashed in the door so badly that it couldn't be opened.  The window was blown out.  The safety glass did exactly as it should and shattered in such a way that neither I nor my three year old son (sitting on the rear, passenger side) was cut.

In a collision as strong as this one you would expect there to be some injuries.  This car protected us so well that the only injuries sustained were an abrasion on each of my forearms from the deployment of my airbag.

This car was wonderful.  We now drive an SUV, but if I ever bought another car it would definitely be a Bonneville.
