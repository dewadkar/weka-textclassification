            The name &quot;SLK&quot; standards for &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot;, it also indicates this is a compact version of the much-loved SL sports car.  Based on a shortened C-class platform, its styling follows 90% of the SL's shape, just shorter, more compact and cute. This design successfully combines fashionable style with the traditional sophisticated image of Mercedes-Benz.�

The SLK was launched in 1996, the year roadster-booming period started. Judging by sales figure of 50,000 units annually, it has been a great success. However, more and more competitors emerged during the period, especially is Audi TT Roadster, which knocks right on the SLK. In contrast, the SLK becomes mechanically outdated and unrefined. Although the electric foldable hardtop is still an interesting and unique feature, the supercharged four-pot was criticized as rough, and harsh. 

Compare with rivals - we�re talking about TT Roadster, the flawed BMW Z3 and Alfa Spider only, not Boxster or S2000 - the Mercedes has the least driver appeal. Why? look at the lazy-revving supercharged engine accompanied with the lazy-driver-beloved 5-speed automatic, you�ll know it was not designed by engineers who really love driving excitement. Maybe the marketing department has too much influence. Commercially that was quite correct, as most of the Mercedes� drivers, especially in the important American market, prefer a relaxed driving style. 
I�m not sure whether Mercedes has listened to such criticism, but at least a make-over in 2000 make the SLK more refined and slightly more agile. The dreadful 2.3 Kompressor (193hp) is still on offer, so is the 2.0 Kompressor (163hp) which serves the European Continent, but they are now topped by a really good engine - the company�s existing 3199 c.c. 18-valve V6. As in E320, CLK320 etc., the power plant is extremely refined - smooth, free-revving and quiet - yet torque at all speed.
Mercedes also improved the transmission. A new close-ratio six-speed manual is taken from the facelifted E-class, which should silent those complaining the SLK lack of a manual. However, the majority will still choose the 5-speed automatic with Tiptronic-style manual mode.
Chassis was also improved, but more like a response to safety and requirements for refinement. The front structure is slightly revised to provide better crash protection. Subframe is added to the front suspensions to filter out shock and vibration. The power steering is also tuned to give more direct feel, although it is actually lighter.� All the changes are evolution rather than revolution, but the summation of them result in a SLK320 which is quicker, refiner and slightly more inspiring to handle than before. <br><br>
