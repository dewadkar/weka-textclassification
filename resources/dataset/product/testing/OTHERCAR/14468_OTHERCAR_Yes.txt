            This was a gift from someone without digital camera experience, who knew I was lost without my first, currently deceased Kodak digital. It was intended to hold me over until I save up for a higher end camera with more features. 

My first reaction to the camera was that it was really small, very light, and seemed awfully flimsy. I wouldn't expect it to be too durable and isn't a good choice if you do any rough activities where it could be crushed, sat on or banged around. The lens cover is built into the on/off feature so that when its off, the lens is covered. But, i wonder what happens when that mechanism breaks (probably the same thing that happened to my 3 yr old Kodak digital... off to the land of lost toys).

I chose not to install the software that came with it because I have much more high end software for digital photography and am adept at moving things around on my computers. So, all I had to do to get going was install the driver on my computer, put in the battery and pop in the 64 MB card that was given to me separately, also as a gift. The camera has 16 MB storage on board so I would definitely recommend adding another card. I can get somewhere between 70 and 80 pictures with that and the additional card. I was disappointed that the cards I had from my other Kodak camera wouldn't work in this set up, though.

Taking pictures was relatively simple - although there are some downsides. There isn't a click or a whirr to tell you that a picture was taken, if there is no flash on - just the blinking green light telling you its saving to your card. It gives you an LCD view of the picture you took for a few seconds so you can confirm that you got what you were shooting and not your thumb, and delete if you want. The menus were fairly easy to use although sometimes it seems a little counter intuitive. Once I used it a while and learned the logic of the menus, I found it very easy to change settings. 

The red eye and macro zoom are my favorite features - albeit on the simple "don't buy it without it" side. I take a lot of close ups and my previous kodak didn't do it well - this works really nice without a lot of blur. It also has a timer so you can get in your pictures. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the photos. My first camera was 1.3 mega pixel and this is only a 2.0 but it gave me enough resolution to work with.  On screen, when you zoom in, there is some "lossiness" in the jpgs that is a bit disturbing but when resized to 4x6" prints, it was flawless. I convert all the jpgs to PNG format as soon as I can so that there is no further degradation but the ordinary human wouldn't bother (or be able). The color accuracy and lighting on this camera is much improved over my first one and I had to optimize only about 10% of the photos I took - adjust lighting, bring up the contrast etc - the rest were actually fine as is. I probably adjusted 50% of the shots from my other camera, by comparison. 

The one worrisome aspect of this camera that I've noticed is that occasionally it will corrupt a picture and it will not be accessible. The preview will appear in the viewfinder, but when I get home, it tells me it is corrupt and I can't view it. That happens to about 2 out of 100 shots and I can't explain why it happens. 

The battery that comes with it is extraordinary - I have taken approximately 200 pictures to date, and have not had the battery fizzle yet. I haven't been able to find a replacement for it but the camera came with an information card that explains which types of batteries to use and how many pictures each comes with. I have some rechargeable lithiums I will try next to compare, but I'd prefer to order another one of the 3V CRV3 lithiums that work so well. 

This camera is a very good bang for the buck - if you can manage without the dock, which is sold separately. I generally get the photos off the camera and onto my hard drive with the USB cable, which allows the camera to simply be recognized as a drive, while you pull everything over (drag and drop). I have also set it up to display on the TV using the video out cable that came with the camera and that is a pretty neat feature. I keep the USB cable with my computer and the video cable in the camera bag in case I want to show off the pictures I've taken to anyone while I'm out.
