            With 139,000 miles on the odometer, what possessed me to buy the 1990 Maxima SE in 1999?  Because Nissan motors are STRONG, especially the engine in Maximas from 1985-1991 (the VG30).  The engine is practically bulletproof: just regularly change the oil and maintain the other necessities (such as belts, oil and fuel filters, etc.) and you will not be disappointed.  It's 2001 now, and my Maxima has almost 190,000 miles on it, and still runs strong.

<b>The Cool Stuff</b>
Being the sport model of the Maxima stable, the SE comes with an aggressively geared (3.29:1 first gear) 5-speed manual (an automatic is optional), rear spoiler with brake light, fog lights, sport suspension, and the ultra-cool black-on-white instrumentation that reverses at night.  You have to see it to believe it.  The instrumentation is a Maxima hallmark that continues today on its SE models.

<b>The Not-So-Cool Stuff</b>
If you've test-driven any cars in the last few years--even economy models--you know that huge advances have been made in making the interior of a car much quieter.  In this area, the Maxima SE stumbles, letting in quite a bit of road and wind noise, despite its much-touted .32 drag coefficient (which carmakers used to wave all over the place back in the early Nineties).

And the motorized belts, relics of the late Eighties/early Nineties, are an unfortunate inclusion to this car.  If you don't remember to manually attach the lap belt, you can be seriously hurt or killed in an accident.  This also means you have to remind each front seat passenger to put the lap belt on.

<b>Performance</b>
The Maxima excels at acceleration off the line and on the freeway, thanks to scads of low-end torque (relative to other Japanese cars).  The engine winds easily to redline, and you'll have to control yourself to prevent some expensive conversations with the local constabulary.  In short, the Maxima SE is F-U-N to drive.

The Maxima SE also has some grip on the road, thanks to its sport-tuned suspension and 195/65-R15 tires.  I strongly advise you switch to 195/60- or 195/55-R15 tires, and you'll see a HUGE improvement in lateral grip.  If you want to use the SE as a project car, you can also install Eibach ProKit springs and performance struts.  Your SE will only drop over one inch, and ride quality won't suffer much, but your SE will suck tarmac like a leech.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The Maxima SE is one fine car, especially for what you can buy it for these days.  As with any used vehicle, have the car thoroughly inspected by a trusted mechanic, and run a lemon check on its VIN (Vehicle ID Number) at Carfax.com.  Don't let those loud auto dealer ads on TV lure you into thinking you have to buy new, because finding well-kept used cars like the Maxima let you know you've made a smart investment.
