            The Kia Rio is among America's least expensive new cars.  It arrived on our shores in 2001 and new for 2002 is the Kia Rio Cinco.  It is 5-door wagon aimed at adding extra versatility to the standard Rio sedan.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The Cinco's styling is a bit quirky, but far from from ugly.  The new 14-inch wheels replace the smallish 13-inch wheels from last year.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: Above about 60 mph or so, engine noise becomes very prominent within the cabin.  The controls are easy to understand, but are not stylish enough for me.  The seats are quite low to the floor and thus provide more than enough head for the likes of me.  The steering wheel, however, does not tilt high enough for me to feel comfortable.  The rear seats provide very little room, unless the driver or front passenger pushes their seat pretty far up.  The Cinco has a convenient 60/40 split-folding rear seat for extra versatility.

<b>ENGINE</b>: Both the sedan and the Cinco are powered (or should I say underpowered?) by a 1.5-liter DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine.  It puts out a reasonable 96 horsepower at 5,800 rpm.  The torque however is what makes the car feel so slow.  Only 98 lb./ft. of torque used to lug around 2,436 pounds is just not adequate enough for my tastes.  The sedan version weighs almost 200 pounds less than a Cinco and should provide better overall acceleration.  If Kia would tune the engine for more low-end torque, both the sedan and the Cinco would be more than adequate.  Around town in the Cinco, I have enough power from stoplights and stop signs.  It is on the highway, however, where I feel the engine is most labored.  Passing power is very feeble.  Despite the fact that there is just not enough power for most situations, fuel economy estimates from the EPA are good, but I averaged worse than expected.  This was probably due to the fact that I was flooring it most of the time to wring out what little power on the highway it had.  I averaged 24.7 mpg on regular unleaded fuel.  

Both the sedan and the Cinco come with either a standard 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic.  The latter transmission hunts annoyingly between gears, but this is again, probably due to the fact that I was flooring most of the time.

<b>HANDLING</b>: As expected, there is a LOT of body lean in the corners.  All Rios are lightweight and this makes them very vulnerable to crosswinds.  My test car has the optional anti-lock brake feature ($400) and brings the Rio to a halt fairly quickly, albeit with some nosedive.

<b>RIDE</b>: The 14-inch wheels do a fairly good job quelling small bumps.  With a short 94.9-inch wheelbase on both body styles, I feel as if when speed increases, ride quality decreases.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Unfortunately, because Kia is so new to the American market, they are bound to make mistakes.  So far, no problems with my test car.  Also, no 2002 Kia vehicle has been issued a recall to date.
