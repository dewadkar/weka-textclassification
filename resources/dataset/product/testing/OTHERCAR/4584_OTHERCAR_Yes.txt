            We recently bought a 97 Hyundai Elantra.  It was bought at a dealership with about 40k miles on it.  I have to say this is a great car.  The style is fashionable, the color is up-to-date, the ride is smooth and it is very quiet inside.  
I had my doubts about a Hyundai.  I had heard they were cheaply made.  If you compare the parts of my Elantra to the parts of my Ford Aerostar, they are the same.  
So far we have had one problem with our car.  The door handle broke.  It just broke in half.  When we went to replace it, we were told that it is a very common problem.  The part was about 11 dollars, so I wasn't too upset.  It does seem to be a defect though.
I think we get near 30 mpg and the quiet ride was surprising.  I have been in quite a few small cars and they are so noisy.  Our Elantra isn't.  
We have three children and the back seat is plenty roomy.  The trunk is quite large.  We did a Consumers Report on the safety of this model and were pleasantly surprised that it rated very good for safety.
I highly recommend this vehicle for small to average size families.<br><br>
