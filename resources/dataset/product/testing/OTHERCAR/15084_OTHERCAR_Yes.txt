            I bought this car as my first new car.  I had been test driving Dodge Neons, Honda Civics, and Saturns but this car stole my heart.  Of course, that was 5 years ago, I was only 21, and now I need something bigger (it only has two seats).

My X-90 had power windows, power locks, power steering, a 5 speed man. transmission, T-tops, stock Alpine CD Changer, 4 wheel drive (with auto locking hubs), 4 wheel anti-lock brakes, but no air conditioning.  I wish I would have had air conditioning installed.  Sometimes the air coming out of the vents felt like the heater was on, even when the thermostat was set to "cold".

The car was great to drive both on and off road.  Due to the extremely short wheelbase, I was able to go places that many larger 4-wheel drive trucks could only dream of.  It was a dream to drive in the snow.  I lived near Lake Tahoe when I owned mine.  I owned it through 3 winters.  I never got stuck, and I was never late to work.  The anti-lock brakes really work, I never lost control on those snowy roads.

During my regular summer driving I enjoyed taking the t-tops off and cruising with the air rushing through my hair (I had more back then).  The noise level was very low, unless I went on the freeway.  Despite its small appearance, it is quite roomy for 2 people.  The trunk was a little small, but my girlfriend (now my wife) and I always managed to fit our road trip supplies inside.

The only problem I ever had was when one of the power windows broke.  It was covered by my warranty, but it was a pain for two, cold, January, weeks while the part was shipped from Japan.

One time, while I was out of town, I locked my keys in the trunk.  There is no trunk release and no locksmith was able to get them out.  I had to wait around while my friend from home sent my spares to me via overnight mail.

There I go, waxing nostalgic, that car really brings back a lot of memories.  I would recommend the X-90 to someone who does not need to move a lot of stuff around and wants to look cool.
