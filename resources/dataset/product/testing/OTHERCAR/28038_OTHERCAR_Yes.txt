            I "fell into" a great deal on a slightly used '00 Plymouth Neon LX.  The original owners had traded it in after one year of ownership because it didn't have antilock brakes.  I picked the car up with 19,000 miles on the odometer for a proverbial song--$9800, even though it's a fully loaded LX model with CD player, upgraded speakers, power locks & windows, alloy wheels, speed control, "theatre" lighting and many other nifty options.

This is my first vehicle powered by a 4-cylinder engine and I must say I'm impressed with the acceleration that the 2.0L, 16-valve engine provides.  My previous car was a fairly lightweight Dodge Spirit with a larger 3.0L V6 engine.  The Neon seems just as zippy in most situations as the V6 Spirit did.

Some of the automotive press likes to rip on the fact that the Neon's automatic transaxle has only three speeds, but I don't find it to be a liability.  The tranny shifts when it's supposed to and the engine's torque ensures that acceleration is never a problem.  I've yet to encounter situations where I wished for more power.  The engine is turning 2500 RPM at 60 MPH in top gear, which is about the same as other small cars with overdrive 4th gears in their automatic transaxles.  

Interior room and comfort is quite good.  Rear seat headroom is a little snug because of the sloping roof, but the rear seat itself is reasonably comfortable.  Leg room isn't that great back there, but it's no worse than other cars in this category.  The Neon LX also features the split folding rear seat to allow access into the trunk from the passenger compartment; a nice feature.

Front seating is very comfortable, with controls well-placed and logical in their function.  The only complaint I have about the interior is the lack of power windows in the rear--kind of an oddity.

The Neon is the best handling car I've ever owned.  It's amazingly good on curves and the suspension seems to sense exactly what you want the car to do.  The steering is very quick and precise.  The turning circle is tight to it's easy to maneuver the car around any situation.

I love the factory sound system in the Neon (as does my daughter!).  It has very good clarity and quality for such an inexpensive car.

In short, I think the Neon is a very good car and worth consideration in the inexpensive compact category.  It seems to be reasonably well-built and with 23,000 miles on the odometer, I'm happy to report no mechanical defects.
