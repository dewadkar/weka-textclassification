            Sony always provides top of the line products.  And the Digital Mavica Still Camera is no exception.  I recently purchased this unit and I love to use it.  This product has given me an interest in photography.

--This camera is perfect for an online family.  Pictures are recorded on easy-to-find floppy disks.  This camera has a high speed 4x disk drive which allows four times the speed when recording or playing back images.  

--The camera has slide show mode, which lets you create a slide show on a disk and then play it back on your television.  You can also E-mail pictures taken with your camera.  

--There is also a voice memo feature, which lets you add up to 5 seconds of narration to your still photos.

--Using MPEG movie mode, you can take up to 60 seconds of video and audio directly to a disk.  

--There are six pre-programmed exposure modes to use, and four special effects.

--The camera has a 2.5&quot; diagonal advanced color LCD screen.  The screen also has brightness control, and a Solar Window panel, which allows viewing in most any lighting conditions.

--The unit also has the Whole Disk Copy feature, which enables you to copy your pictures right inside the camera, and save images in the camera�s temporary memory and save them to a new disc later.

--The unit features 3x optical/6x digital zoom, 1/60-1/4000 second shutter speeds, and a 10-second self timer

--Power source is an Info-Lithium rechargeable battery.  Remaining battery time is also displayed on the LCD screen.

Now that you know all the features, I will tell you what I think of the camera�FANTASTIC!  The Digital Mavica has so many features that your photos will never be the same.  And even though there are many features, you can learn them quickly and easily.  Another thing that I love is that you can use your images in Microsoft Word, Excell, and PowerPoint files.  And as always, Sony quality prevails.  This is a great camera for a family.  It is well worth the investment if you like to hold on to your memories.
