            The audi A4 was re-designed for 2002.  Improvements include a more powerful V-6 engine, stiffer chassis, and various other small refinements to an already nice car, as well as a complete restyling.  I eagerly awaited the new 2002 model, but ultimately decided against purchasing one.  I was disappointed in some areas of the car, as well as Audi USA's ridiculous policy of not releasing pricing information until the cars were literally on the lots. This made it impossible to order a car with any real assurance of what it would cost.  

Here's my assesment of the Audi A4:

EXTERIOR:

The new styling of the A4 is nice. I liked the old version, but it tended to look like a "small car" which it was.  It was more cutsey than hot looking.  The new A4 shares some A6 styling cues, which is a good thing, but maybe too much of one.  The high waist and lack of aggressive curves isn't my favorite, but overall, it's a nice looking car.  Audi fit and finish has always been top notch, and I expect this to be the same on 2002 models.  The 17" wheels available only on the sports package are a must if you want an aggressive look, though the 16" wheels are attractive also and would give you a smoother ride.  

INTERIOR:  The 2002 A4 adds things like climate control and standard CD player/cassette.  Unfortuntely, the interior doesn't seem much bigger than previous models.  This leaves me a little cramped when driving, especially when trying to use a clutch.  Much to my regret, I found my right knee digging into the middle console when driving.  I can't believe the Audi engineers didn't notice this!   A sharp edge of the middle instrument cluster digs into your leg and is annoying.  The seats are very comfortable otherwise.  Rear seat room is not great, but probably ok for ocassional use.  This is not really a family sized car, folks.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to the stereo (bose and standard) but neither was bad or extra-impressive to me.  I'd stick with the standard to save money.  I was very impressed with the materials quality on the base 1.8T model. The aluminum trim looked great, and the perforated vinyl seats looked and felt like leather.  In fact, the 3.0 model with wood trim didn't look as nice to me.  Overall, this is a very nice interior.  I just wish the driver's position was better for someone with a 34" inseam.  Shorter drivers may not have a problem.

PERFORMANCE:  I drove both the 4 cylinder 1.8T and 3.0 V-6 versions with manual transmissions.  The 1.8T felt and sounded great, considering the price and power.   The 5 speed transmission did suffer from the typical Audi high clutch uptake that I don't care for.  It wasn't as smooth shifting as I liked, but extended use would probably solve that as you learn to drive it better.   The 6 speed on our tester was terrible!  It was balky and stiff, and was simply unacceptable.  I suspect that this early-production model was a defective one.  Be sure to test drive before ordering!   The 3.0 V-6 was surprisingly coarse to my ears.  Definitely not like a BMW inine 6.   

Handling was superb with the sports package, though a little rougher riding than the BMW 3 series.   It was also a little noisy, with tire and wind noise evident.  Not terrible, but not what I expected either.  Braking was also fine.  Acceleration comes in two forms. The standard 1.8T has 170 hp and is adequate with the manual transmission.  The new CVT "multitronic" transmission is highly regarded, and should now allow you to drive without shifting and still achieve adequate acceleration.  Forget getting quattro and the Tiptronic auto. You'll have a very sluggish car.  The 3.0 was of course quicker, but not as much as I thought, at least by the seat of my pants feel.   I would definitely consider a 1.8T over the 3.0 to be a better value.  

RELIABILITY, DEALERS, SAFETY, RESALE, ETC:

Audis are solidly built, but like most German cars, they have their quirks and reliability problems.  Expect to have a few visits to the dealer over the years.  The 50K mile, 4 year warranty and included scheduled maintenance should help ease the pain, however.  Resale value on A4's is a notch below that of the more prestigious luxury brands, but not terrible.  A lesser equipped model would probably be a better bet than a loaded up one, if you're looking to limit your depreciation.  These cars range from the high 20's to $40,000, so add options wisely.  When it's 5 years old there won't be $3,000 difference in trade-in value, most likely, between a top end and low end model.  

Safety is expected to be great, based on tests I've read about, but keep in mind that this is a small car.  Side and head curtain airbags are a plus, as is standard ABS and stability control.  But watch out for Mack Trucks.  

Overall, I really like the A4.  It's a great car.  I just found that with the models arriving on lots really loaded with options I don't want or need, and the slightly too-small size, it just wasn't right for me.   Models on the lots were all in the upper 30K's, while I wanted one more modestly equipped.  A fwd 1.8T with manual transmission, sports package, and nothing else would run around $30,000. You can "chip" the turbo engine to get more power and torque, and at that price it's a great value. I'm not so sure about the more costly versions.  If you want a German car with sports appeal and one that's NOT a BMW, this is a great choice.   If you can't fit comfortably in it, you might take a look at the very similar VW Passat, which is more spacious.
