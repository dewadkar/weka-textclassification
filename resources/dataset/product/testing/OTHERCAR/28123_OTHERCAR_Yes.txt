            Man oh Man... Finally a camera for everyone. I have been the owner of numerous Digital Cameras, but this one is the best by far. I mean from the looks to the price, it's the best for anyone and everyone!!! I have to say when I purchased this camera at first I didn't like it. The reason is due to the shape. I'm used to having the ordinary camera look, the rectangular shapes. It took me a few days of use to get used to it, but when I did I would never go back. This camera has everything, and the pictures it takes are just unreal. I have had so many people ask to borrow it for their classes, because it is just an unreal camera. The color LCD 1.8&quot; viewable is awesome. You have a choice of either VGA or XGA format... I normally store the pictures in XGA, because that's the best quality and the camera has plenty enough room to hold up to 20 pictures in XGA 1024x768 mode... That's just unreal for the price... So in other words take my word on it, don't bother looking any further this is the one you want!!!<br><br>
