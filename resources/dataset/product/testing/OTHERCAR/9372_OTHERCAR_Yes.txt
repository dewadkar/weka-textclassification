            The Toyota 4 Runner, where to start, the exterior, the exterior is very well designed and stylish, the lines are great and it just looks excellent. The interior looks just as good as the exterior, it is plush and futuristic with many neat options, the power seats are especially nice. The sound system is also a thing of beauty. It also has a large amount of room for every passenger.

Now to the performance, the engine isn't like a race car or anything, but if necasery, and in two wheel drive, it will burnout for about 100 feet. And when the 4x4 is engaged you can bet your buddies that you can climb just about anything. Our new house has a 600 ft. long driveway, and while under construction it was about a foot of thick deep mud, and the driveway is not flat at any point, very tough to navigate. Even my friends 4x4 pickup couldn't make it up, but the 4 runner, first try. It made it up like the mud wasn't even there. But the same handling that makes the 4 runner great off-road also hurts it a bit on road, the suspension is very beefy and may seem a bit rough to you luxury car fans. But for me it's fine, it's not like you get thrown around or anything but it's not like a small sport compact either, it's a REAL TRUCK. So if you think your ready for a great SUV then the 4 Runner is for you.
