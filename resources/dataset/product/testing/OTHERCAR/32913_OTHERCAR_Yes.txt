            After owning a Ford &amp; a Toyota, I am now a real Chevrolet enthusiast. I own the 1999 Chevrolet C1500. It is my third Chevrolet vehicle. These autos are made to last. Previously, I had a Blazer &amp; would still have it had I not needed a work vehicle. The truck, and my husband's Chevrolet Venture, never gave me a moments problem. It answers everything I every wanted. The C1500 looks great, has a smooth ride, carries everybody, &amp; runs beautifully.

I now have 2 children, both of which, are in car seats. The extend cab takes them, their toys, stroller, &amp; other necessities without any effort. In fact, it is so roomy that I can fit all this &amp; still have space for groceries and whatever else I need to carry.  
The extended wheel base &amp; super shocks make you feel that you are riding on air. When my husband drives I am able to read and write without any difficulty. 

The C1500 has a polished, neat exterior. Its sleek design would make anyone feel that they are riding in &quot;style.&quot; It also did very well on the government offset crash tests.  Nothing beats a chevy truck!
