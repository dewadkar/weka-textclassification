            Our family just recently purchased a used 1993 Toyota Previa.  It is the most perfect vehicle for our large family.  Being used it has so many positive features.  It is nice not having to worry about the door dings or how clean the inside needs to always be.  The Previa is a more affordable and reliable minivan.  I was looking for a minivan that did not have dual airbags and luckily found this gem.  The cost for this vehicle could rang from $8000-$13,500.  It is definitely the more reasonable than purchasing a new Sienna with less worry.  The Previa is very easy to drive.  Surprising the easiest one I have ever driven compared to all other makers of the mini vans.  There are some blind spots like all vehicles.  The Previa drives like a compact car.  It is amazing.  This vehicle would be perfect for a larger family, a soccer family, or anyone would need to transport lots of adults or children being that is seats seven.  If you want a great vehicle, the Toyota Previa is for you!
