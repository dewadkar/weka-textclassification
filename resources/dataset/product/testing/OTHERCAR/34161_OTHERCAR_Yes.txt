            We live in a small midwestern town and my wife commutes 100 miles a day.We purchased our first camry in 1993.It was a very basic four cylinder five speed with no extras.We paid around $ 14,000.To day our son Brett is still driving that camry.It has 170,000 miles and has had a brake job(165,00) and a timing belt( fixed at 160,000 as a preventative.The car burns no oil and shows no signs of wearing out.Our second camry a 1996 4 cylinder,five speed with a few more luxuries(moon roof, electric locks and windows,a security system..)has 111,000 and has not been touched.I am not sure what more could be expected of these cars.They have been unbelievably dependable.e are now on our third and i see no reason to ever buy a different model.<br><br>
