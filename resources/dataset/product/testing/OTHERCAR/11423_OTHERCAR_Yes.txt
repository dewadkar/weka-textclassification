            this is the third SUV that i got within that last 2 years. It's on the more luxurious side of sporty. It has a lot of good features at a very affordable price. Everyone should own one. Of All of my cars (and i have a lot) this one is second on my list only to the chevy blazer) This car is very spacious and has absoulutely great handeling. The interior of this car is absolutly wonderful with many handy little placements. The engine is so quiet that you would never know that it is a truck. I would definatly recommend this car to anyone that goes on road trips, camping or just loves a wonderfully built SUV. I myself am the biggest SUV fan (I own 3) and i love the sleek body of the 4runner that none of the other SUV's have. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL CAR. <br><br>
