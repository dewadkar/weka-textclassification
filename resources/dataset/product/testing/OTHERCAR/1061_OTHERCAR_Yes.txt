            I have dreamed of owning a Cherokee for about 3 years now.  My dream came true on June 21, 2000!  I test drove the Blazer and the Explorer too.  The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo that I tested was by far the best ride amongst the three.  Very smooth and car-like.  I feel very comfortable driving it.  I bought the same Jeep that I test-drove.  It is black and beautiful.  Spacious, and secure-feeling.  I can't explain it, but this is one special vehicle.  I highly recommend it.  Anyone who wants comfort, style, easy acceleration, and fun should buy this vehicle.  I cannot say how good it is off-road yet as I have just purchased it, but I can only imagine.  What a pleasure it is to pay for something that you absolutely love!<br><br>
