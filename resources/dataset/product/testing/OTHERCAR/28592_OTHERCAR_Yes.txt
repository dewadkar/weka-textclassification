            I can�t begin to tell you how much fun this vehicle is� I know Jeep stands for Just Empty Every Pocket�but man oh man what fun. I highly recommend joining a local Jeep club to get full use out of your Jeep. I have learned a lot about how the Jeep functions simply by being a member of a local club. This vehicle is unbelievable from the show room� Yes its loud but it�s a Jeep� they have refined the inside to give it a car like appearance for those of you who buy one to (God forbid) run to the grocery store or mall. I am now driving this as my main vehicle and I am happy everday I climb into it. You become a member of and elite group and all other Jeeps will wave if you wave to them� how many other drivers do that? <br><br>
