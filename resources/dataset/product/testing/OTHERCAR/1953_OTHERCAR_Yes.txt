            The new 2000 Nissan Maxima, I really don't know why the designers at Nissan motors would change the body style of such a good looking automobile. I think the new design is very ugly,it looks to dam futuristic, its not as bad as the oval shaped Ford Tauras, but compared to the 99 Maxima the 2000 is gross. I do however think that the added horsepower and standard features makes the new Maxima an even better automobile,despite the new look. The Maxima has always been a high performance car thats fun to drive, with lots of room and a low price tag. So if you can stomach the new body style, it's still a great car.<br><br>
