            	I first got this camera when mega-pixel was just coming around.  After checking out similar cameras, I knew this one was it.  At the time, it was the cheapest mega-pixel camera available.
	It didn't let me down.  The image quality is excellent, and the ability to store the raw images in different formats inside the camera is nice too.  JPEG, or perhaps uncompressed.  The sound annotation feature is nice too, though I am not too inclined to wasting memory so I can hear my own voice :).
	The recycle time is a little too long though.  There is too much time in between pictures.  Although you can use a burst mode.
	Also, the menuing system in the camera is great, but the color LCD draws a little too much battery.  I definitely recommend using lithium batteries.
	Also, the viewfinder is not in line with the lens.  So if you get too close to your subject, you have to adjust the aiming of the camera, or use the LCD as a viewfinder.<br><br>
