            I was going to review this camera almost as soon as I got it. I am glad I waited so that I could tell you more about the camera and not base my opinion purely on the fact that I was very excited to finally have a digital camera!

The Polaroid PDC640 is a relatively inexpensive camera, especially when it comes to a digital. It is also fairly simple to use. It comes with a minimal memory card that holds about 20 pictures at a relatively high resolution (translation: a resolution good enough that you can tell WHO is in the picture, not just that there is a person in the picture.) 

Extra memory cards of varying capacities are available and the cost (comparative to purchasing film) is relatively low (my kids got me an 8MB card, which will hold about 90 pics at higher resolution for about $20.) The camera comes with 2 cables and a power adapter, one cable for jacking into your TV through the video intake, and one for connecting to your PC. The power adapter is not very good for use in actually taking pictures, because of the limits on your portability, however, for use while you are connected to a TV or computer, it is almost mandatory, as this camera eats batteries faster than my kids go through their candy on Trick or Treat night! Hooking the camera up to a TV is useless for anything except maybe taking the pictures to Grandma�s house for a slide show. Downloading to the PC is painless and the only thing that is problematical about connecting to the PC is making sure you have a free port for the cable. 

The software that comes with the camera is simple to install and use, however, considering the quality of the camera, in order to properly adjust photo color, brightness and sharpness, you really need to have more specialized software, such as Adobe Photoshop. On the other hand, the software included comes with a fun little program where you can superimpose your face on the face of various people (only those included on the CD) such as the Statue of Liberty, an Olympic athlete or the Mona Lisa.

That�s about it for �nice� on this camera.  There is no zoom, and although there are settings for �close ups� and distance shots, they are only for focus/lighting, and serve to be more confusing than anything. And, if you screw up the setting when you take the picture, it will look as though you took it on a dark cloudy day even if it is sunny. There is also a �real time� mode that you can use to see what is framed in the display rather than trying to look through the viewfinder. As best I can figure out, this is to hold the camera up over your head in a crowd to get a picture of Jay Leno on a crowded street. It seems like a nice feature at first, until you realize that you cut the life of your batteries (4 AA) down to about 8 minutes! Battery life is fairly short to begin with on this camera, and unless you have brand new batteries, �powering up� to take a photo can take about a minute�long enough for you to miss the shot!

If you are taking a close-up OR a wide-angle landscape type shot you will probably be okay with this camera, otherwise don�t expect much. My sons wrestle, and when I took photos of their matches, even though I didn�t think I was that far away, they looked like ants on the mat. Not exactly a picture you can email to grandma.  

All in all, although I wouldn�t buy it again knowing what I know now, this isn�t a bad camera for your first digital camera, and it will let you know what features are important for you to get on your next camera, and heck, for the price, when you can't put up with it anymore, you can pass it on to the kids so they can get started on picture taking without running you broke on film. That is, so long as you hold company stock in Duracell�!
