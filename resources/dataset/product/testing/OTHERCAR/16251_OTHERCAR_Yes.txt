            I purchased a &quot;leftover&quot;  99 Corolla VE in October. I really like the car, especially considering that it replaced a 1985 Nissan Stanza that had seen better days. I didn't have a choice of color or options. My car is a dark green, which looks good, but it seems to  show dirt more than other colors. This model does not come with a clock. The 2000 versions do. It has a rear defroster, AC, and auto transmission, power steering and brakes.  This model does not have power windows or doors which is fine by me. Those options always stir up visions of decapitations and entrapment in a watery grave in the depths of the Hudson River. The car handles well and is fairly peppy on the Interstate. The seal between the inner and outer realm is very tight. For a relatively small car you do feel like you are in your own little environment. If I were to buy another car in the near future, I would look for added safety features like side-impact airbags and anti-lock bakes. Overall I am pleased with my car. I do wish that the Echo had been out at the time, so that I would have been able to give that model consideration. I did get a fairly good deal on the leftover 99, so I can't complain about price. This car is good for a single person who is looking for economy in price and mpg, reliability and easy maintenance. I haven't tried out the rear legroom yet but it might be cramped for a long ride.<br><br><br><br>
