            I've owned my Jeep for just about a month. I have the 4X4, Inline 6 with Selec-Trac.  The Grand Cherokee looks great, has big, bright headlights, a comfortable seat, and a nice ride.  I love the Jeep because it's a powerful, REAL SUV, but not obnoxious in size.  The Grand Cherokee doesn't have an overly-intimidating look on the road.

When shopping for a new vehicle, I tested the Ford Explorer and Dodge Durango as well.  The Jeep had a much quieter and smoother ride, and better gas consumption.  There is not a 3rd seat available in the 2001 Grand Cherokee, even as an option.  This is fine for me, since I'm not using the vehicle for a large family.

"Surprises":
Also missing from the standard package is a towing package.  This wasn't hard to fix.  The roof rack needs crossbars to hold a moderate load.  This is also easy to find aftermarket.  A cargo net is a must in the rear, and the flat one that came with the vehicle wasn't working.  There's an "envelope" type net that works better for groceries and miscellaneous items.  I found mine for $9 on ebay.  Neither the glove box or the console locks.  Keep your valuables with you or at home?  Finally, it fit in my single car garage!

"Good Things":
A second lighter outlet is handy, and the cupholders are well placed.  The overhead console has some fun features to play with (Instant and cumulative MPG, language, trip set, etc.), and even customize some options (how long do you want the headlamps to stay on?  Would you like a horn beep when you remote lock the vehicle? etc.)  The side mirrors are large and give a wide view of traffic.  Deep tint glass is also standard.  I am 6' and there is a LOT of leg/headroom in front.  It wasn't an uncomfortable ride in the back, either.  The flipper glass is nice, as an option to lifting the whole back gate.  Also, folding down the split back seat is easy to do, and gives a ton of cargo room.

The engine is powerful, even the I-6, unless you're towing - then you'll need to disengage the O/D.  Transfer case shifting is smooth and easy.

Although it's only been a month, so far I've had a lot of fun in the Laredo.  I'll keep you posted!
