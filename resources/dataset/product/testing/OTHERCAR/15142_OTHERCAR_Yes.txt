            This is one of the best looking cars on the road.

I know that opinions here are supposed to be unbiased, but I'll tell you up front that I am VERY biased toward American brand automobiles - especially General Motors makes.  This is because I grew up in the Detroit area and my father has worked for GM for over 35 years.  So, basically, I've had no other choice!  (Though there was that Toyota idea I had back in the early '80s...)

Oh, and if you're looking for statistics on torque and horsepower, I'm NOT the one!  I'm more interested in how a car makes me FEEL and how it does what I need it to do.

But, all that aside, let's consider the Pontiac Grand Am.  I just purchased a used 1996 Grand Am SE.  This is my second Grand Am and I've loved both.  Mainly because of the stylishness and the affordability.  But I'm also pleased with the performance of the 3.1 litre 6 cylinder engine - it's quite &quot;peppy&quot; - at least for me!

Now I did have some trouble with my previous Grand Am's transmission so I am going to be wary and watchful for that.

Things I wish were different about this car:  wish it had a roomier interior, wish it had pulse windshield wipers and a tilt steering wheel.  But these are things I can live without - for now.

So, until I trade up to a Cadillac El Dorado, I'll cruise happily in my Grand Am with the radio blaring!<br><br>
