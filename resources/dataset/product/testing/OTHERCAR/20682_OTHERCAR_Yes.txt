            My father bought this vehicle used in 1998.  It had about 8,000 miles on it.  For the family, the Volvo has been very reliable.  Which starts on the likes of this vehicle.  The car has very strong acceleration and great braking properties.  I love the hum of the engine off the line.  Beautiful.  The S70 gives the driver a peace of mind that is priceless.  Breaking the boring Volvo tradition, this car actually looks &quot;unVolvo-like.&quot;  Very nice but remember, it's not a sports car.  The interior is nice, with comfortable seats, easily adjustable amenities, and cupholders.  The sound quality of the stereo is decent but the air condition is cold, good for the hot Texas weather I'm blessed with.  There is plenty of leg room and head room for the taller folks.  The service plans are easy to follow.  The car, however, has a very heavy steering wheel which takes a long time to get used to.  It makes turning a challenge for novice Volvo drivers.  Other than that, the car is solid.  Buy this vehicle for power, safety, and peace of mind.  Don't buy the S70 if you want a sleek sports sedan.  A bit expensive, but it's a good entry-level luxury car.<br><br>
