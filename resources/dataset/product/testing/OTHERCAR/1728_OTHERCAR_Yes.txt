            Being a professional photographer, having the right equipment is very important. The Canon EOS D2000 is not only the equipment a photographer needs to succeed in the digital photography world, working with scenery, graphic rendering, and imaging, but the camera comes loaded with features that you won't find with other cameras.

Canon EOS D2000 Professional Digital Camera, in my opinion is a breakthrough product with significant improvements in image quality and camera performance. The distinctive EOS D2000 features include a newly developed high-quality 2-million pixel Charge Coupled Device (CCD) imaging sensor; a convenient built-in 1.8 inch LCD color monitor; high-speed shooting capacity of up to 12 consecutive frames at 3.5 frames per second (fps); a compact body that is easy to carry and operate; and significant improvements in flash exposure control and viewfinder appearance. 

<b>The EOS D2000 increases my productivity by reducing traditional photographic consumables</b>, shortening image workflow procedures, and increasing their time to deadlines with immediate access to images. With the EOS D2000, it makes digital images taken anywhere in the world be made available immediately and appear on a printed page within one hour.

An hour might seem like a long time, but the quality of these photos is like no other. The pixel resolution is remarkable and looks as if it was taken with a 40 or 50,000 dollar camera.

To my knowledge, the EOS D2000, was developed jointly by Canon Inc. and the Eastman Kodak Company, combining the unique technological strengths and manufacturing expertise of both companies. The EOS D2000 was developed as a successor to the first Canon/Kodak digital SLR which I had (and also works wonders), the EOSDCS 3, which continues to enjoy an excellent reputation in the marketplace.

I Hope this is helpful to those of you seeking to purchase on of these wonderful cameras!
