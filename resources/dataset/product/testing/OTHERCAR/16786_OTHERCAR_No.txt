            I wish I could keep this car out of the shop.  At 50,000 miles, the transmission needed rebuilding.  At 53,300, it needed rebuilding again.  At 92,000, I had it rebuilt yet again.  Still wasn't right and took three additional visits to get overdrive option working correctly.  A fifth transmission was needed at 112,000.  5 trannies with an average life of 12,000 miles.  Dealer and DaimlerChrysler no help. 

Electrical problems also.  Cell phone plugged into lighter adapter causes car to stall.  Randomly, power windows will not operate and airbag light refuses to go out.  Low window washer indicator light comes on even though reservoir is full.

The only good thing I can say about this vehicle is that it is comfortable to drive.
