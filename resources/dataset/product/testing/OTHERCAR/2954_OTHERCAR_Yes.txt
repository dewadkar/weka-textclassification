            I leased my 97 GS-R from brand new. I run a business and prvious to this car, I leased a new car every 3 or 4 years. Being a bit of a car fanatic, I have always taken pride in maintaining my vehicles very well. Well, the time came to trade this car in, but I just couldn't do it - I loved this car too much. I have approximately 160,000 miles on this vehicle now and I swear it still runs like new - probably even a little better.

The car is very quick, redlines at 8200RPM, and is literally "big fun" every time I get into it for a drive - even to the corner store! The handling is nimble. The storage factor is also a huge bonus. A hatchback with 50/50 split fold down rear seats allows one to cart a very surprising amount of gear along. This was also important for myself and helps tremendously with my business use.

For the person interested in "modifications or tuning" there is a huge array of manufacturers who make aftermarket parts for this car. I have changed a few parts and have modest modifications. I put on a new intake, header and "cat-back" exhaust to this car and notice a slight increase in power and a little deeper sound.

No major repairs have needed to be undertaken with this extremely reliable car. In fact I still am driving with the original "clutch" which is in great condition. The engine in this car, as with most Honda's, if properly maintained, will literally keep going and going....

There are certainly many nice cars on the market today, yet I can truly say that I am still very satisfied with my 97 Integra GS-R.
