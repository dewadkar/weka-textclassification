            I bought my base model manual transmission accent brand new in the spring of 1997. I did a lot of research and test drove a dozen cars. I was looking for an entry level car and I still believe the accent was the best choice. However I have some reservations about my choice and feal if I was to make it again I would only get the Accent if I couldn't have scrapped up a couple thousand dollars more. My pros and cons should help illustrate why:

CONS

-ride
the ride is rough. I don't mind feeling bumps around the city but on the highway the car bobs up and down slightly causing my head to be constantly in motion - this gets annoying

-fuel economy
this is a small car so economy is good, but the Civic, Tercel and other still beat the accent and are a bit more sporty

-rust
some tiny spots of rust have appeared on the door jambs and inside the rear hatch drainage holes, more significant rust spots are on the underside of the car -- if I had spent the money on yearly rust proofing this would have been avoided

-rattle
their are two rattles inside of interior panels I can easily remove

-fading
the plastic liner inside the rear hatch has faded in the sun and looks terrible

-defects
three defects were repaired under warranty in the first year: new clutch cylinder, new oxygen sensor and oil leak in the engine

-seats
the fabric on the drivers seat has stretched and looks bad, the seat is too soft

PROS

-controls
the clutch and shifter are well positioned and comfortable to use as are all the controls, the foot rest to the left of the clutch is a great touch

-practical
the hatch back design allows easy loading of big object and makes this car a very capable moving machine despite its small size

-features
good selection of features for price including variable speed wipers, trunk light, floor mats

-fun
the car is fun to drive, peppy

-reliable
since the initial defects were resolved in the first year the car has been perfectly reliable

Conclusion
The Accent was redesigned last year and some of my cons may no longer be relevant. What hasn't changed is the low price (compared with competition). I do recommend the Accent to those who can't afford to spend 2-4 thousand more for something a little more refined. Of course that is assuming the car doesn't fall apart in its four and onward years of ownership. I don't expect it to but am less convinced than if I had a Honda, Nissan or Toyota.<br><br>
