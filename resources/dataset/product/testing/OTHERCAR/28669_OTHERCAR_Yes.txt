            This is my 2nd Cherokee, after having owned an '86 Pioneer. What a difference! This '92 Limited is a dream. She has a "Deluxe" insulation package, which makes her interior very quiet. All leather interior, power front seats, windows, side mirrors and door locks, (factory?) tinted rear windows and more, make her a pretty satisfying ride with all the needed amenities. Her exterior is mint condition, in brilliant flawless candy apple red. Yes, even her bumpers and end-caps are red, there's no black anywhere, except (of course) for her tires and the rubber around the windows. She has GOLD trim, GOLD lettering, and GOLD rims - all standard. 15inch White Letter BF Goodrich tires complete the impressive first look. When you do a double-take - and you will - you'll realize that she also has a roof rack, towing package with a class 111 hitch, fog lamps, 4wheel drive and front bumper protectors. Under her hood is a very quiet 4.0 in-line 6 cylinder engine w/overdrive. Everything is clean and well maintained. This car is 10 years old and if I didn't tell you, you might never know it. She had 79k original miles on her when we met in January 2002 and she still purrs like a cat. But don't let that fool you ... she accelerates like a racehorse ... I know, I have put her through her paces (any cops reading this?). She has never hesitated on me. This car has all the legendary ruggedness of a Jeep, and nearly all the comfort and convenience of a luxury car (who needs heated seats?). I highly recommend it to anyone who has the good fortune to find one in good condition. With other options I haven't mentioned such as the factory security alarm and 4wheel anti-lock brakes (I won't tell everything!), the $6,300 I paid for her was a steal.
