            The only good thing about my Plymouth Voyager is that it is roomy.  However, that is seldom an issue, since it spends several days per month at the repair garage.  I own a 1992 and I have averaged about $180 per month over the last three years in repair costs.  I have things break I have never seen break on any other car. Details:

Rear Windshield motor.

Bolts that hold the Alternator to its bracket. Imagine a bolt so poor engineered it sheared off.

Transmission made it 102,000 miles.  According to the transmission shop that was a record for Chrysler vans.  The average for Chrysler vans is only about 85,000.

Rear rattle that cannot be fixed. maybe i should put a bell back there.

Ignition switch assembly. Spent long evening awaiting tow.

Check engine light is on indefinitely.  Usually for one sensor or another.

The child seat (middle seat pop up) head rest literally broke off.  That ought to win some safety tests.

CV boots--regularly.

Serpentine belt came off at 39,000 miles.  Enjoyed the tow  to a garage.

Air Conditioner.

Cooling fan. Chrysler only part--nice touch Ching $$$$

Cooling fan sensors.

Oxygen sensors.

Door Sensors.

Rear door.

Radiator, another stranded day.

I am tired.  I can't go on. These things are all in addition to the normal 400-500 dollars every 15,000 miles it takes to have regularly scheduled maintenance performed.  SO WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE CHRYSLER has cash rebates, special financing, lots with &quot;new&quot; 1999 vehicles when the 2001 vehicles are due in?  They engineer cheap.  Honda builds cars in the US and they run for years.  People wait in line to buy Honda Odyssey vans.  Chrysler uses the same American workers and produces junk.  It is their sloppy engineering.  Engineered to quit.  When I complained to Chrysler I received a letter telling me that they had worked hard to improve their quality.  RIGHT!  They ought to offer free mental therapy for all the times me and my Plymouth Voyager sit beside the road watching others drive by.

Save yourselves the headache---AVOID PLYMOUTH AT ALL COST!!!  

Please save yourselves some pain--buy a Honda.  That is what i am doing.  If I ever buy another Chrysler it will be too soon.  I am surprised the paint didn't come off in the rain.  <br><br>
