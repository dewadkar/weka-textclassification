            Last week my truck of 12 years broke down, I had to rent a vehicle to survive going to work and having a buddy show up for a visit.

I was lucky enough to be able to rent a Vitara. It was the 2001 model.  White, four-door V-6 engine. 

The air-conditioner was a gentle breeze in the heat ravaged Austin, especially during the long drive home at the peak heat hours into the sun.  When the freak rain-storm happened, the wipers in the front and back helped out my sight. The washer fluid for the back window helped terribly so when I was splashed with mud from a passing truck in a construction area.

Access to the controls is so well thought out that you do not even have to think about where you are putting your hands.  While listening to the great sound system you can cruise around in your Vitara in ice cold air conditioning or toasty warm heat (I checked it out also).  

Room, there is not a terrible amount in the back seat for extremely tall or large people, it is good for kids.  The front seats are comfortable and give good back support.  The truck area is one of my favorites, with the side opening back door, you can fit extremely long items.  The two back seats both fold completely down with the head rests taken off.  You could in effect, sleep back there in a pinch.  

The only problem I noticed, and it could have been just that model, that vehicle. It was the gear shift (it was an automatic) got stuck in park several times.  Maybe something happened with the overdrive, or the four-wheel drive shift, I don't know. It is something I feel I should mention.  

Rent it, heck I am thinking about buying it.
