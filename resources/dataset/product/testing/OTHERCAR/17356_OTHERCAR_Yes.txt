            In the fall of 2000 I bought the 2001 Accord EX with a V6, automatic, 6 CD in dash changer and sunroof.  After 9 months of ownership and 18,xxx miles I am quite pleased with the purchase.  It has run flawlessly since the day we picked it up with no reason to bring it back to the dealer except for oil changes and tire rotations. 

Engine:  The engine, which is the lifeblood of any car, runs perfectly. Quiet, yet powerful for those times you need it for passing.  Low-end torque I feel is lacking, but over 30 mph the power band is smooth acceleration comes on strong.  

Fit and body finish:  Excellent is all I can say.  I have been a long time Chevy owner and have always had nits to pick....but with this Accord, there really is nothing to gripe about.  The body panels fit well, the seats are adjustable and comfortable and nothing rattles yet.  However legroom could be improved for my 6'2" frame.  It is right at the edge of comfort for me.  My 5'6" wife loves it.  She says it fits like a glove and wouldnï¿½t give this car up for anything now.  

Ride and Handling:  The ride is good.  Not billowy like a Buick or rough like a Mustang, but right in the middle.  You feel the bumps but they are not jarring. Is is more like they are telling you they are there.  The handling is different than any other car I have driven.  It takes some getting used to but once you drive it for 50 or 100 miles, it starts to grow on you.  It's not tight like an Olds Intrigue, nor is it loose and wandering.  Just test drive it, but put a few miles on it when you do.....like 50.  You will see what I mean.

Mileage:  We have been averaging about 23-24 mpg in the city with constant highway driving rendering about 29 mpg.  On one stretch of lonely Nebraska highway leading to Denver we got 30 mpg, cruising 75-85 on the interstate with a fully loaded back seat.  For contrast my Olds Intrigue, which is a 6 cylinder as well, just squeaks out 24 on the highway.
