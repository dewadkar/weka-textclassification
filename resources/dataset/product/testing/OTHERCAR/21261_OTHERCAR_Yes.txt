            Hi I have a 2000 Camry LE, we have had it for two months, this is the second Camry we have owned.If you are in the market for a new  car do your self a favor and test drive the Camry. We are an elderly couple and my wife was considering stopping driving,but since we have this car I can't get her to let me drive. It handles so good in traffic and has plenty of get up and go. We have the four cylinder and it will really run. My granddaughter wants to borrow it all the time she has a Honda and she says the Camry is more pepperer.We get thirty miles to the gallon in town, should be better on the road. Great car and a great dealership. Thanks Leland<br><br>
