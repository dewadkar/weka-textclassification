            Hi, I'm writing to you because I've been looking through all the possible sites for purchases on the net for the past 3 weeks (I was getting sick of it)lol So, ok I bought a D-link 350F but it wasn't my first intention. The guy at the shop (La Central Informatique (shoplci.com))bought one for himself quite a while ago and told me he was satisfied with it so I asked him if he could bring it to the shop so that I could see how it was working... and I was quite surprised. 

First of all, after many weeks of virtual shopping and after many calls, I was left with 2 choices ( I went at Radio Shack and tried the two): Logitech Quickcam Messenger OR Creative Labs webcam Pro. The Logitech Camera had many features to play with. Creative labs didn't. BUT Creative had a very very sharp image, very clear. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the color.. it wasn't very good. Logitech had good colors though... so I was stuck with those choices and finally chose Logitech for the price (it was cheapest at LCI).

I went at the shop and, as I wrote earlier on, the guy proposed me to buy D-link which is a company known for rooters and stuff... 

Today I tried it ans it was nice to see that for the price, the quality was quite good. The retail price was over 100$... 125 I think... I paid mine 62 $ CAN with taxes (without them it was 55)so... 46 US $

Ok now, less about my story, more about the camera's details.

For the price I paid, I could've get another 3 in 1 webcam but ok, I've got to say it IT WAS SCRAP! It looked like a FisherPrice Toy ok!? lol 

The D-link camera isn't scrap. When you take it in your hands, you don't feel like it'll break, which is a positive point. What I like less is that the image is so so in video conference. But still, it's not THAT BAD for the price, especially when you consider that you get not only a webcam but a portable digital camera which takes pictures as good as the ones you'd get with an average camera with films.The webcam doesn't seem to tolerate darkness... so you need light. When you have light near, it's good.

The D-link camera is very easy of use and it has many features. You can choose the environment in which you're taking your pictures: outside but cloudy, outside sunny, inside sunny or inside dark. You have 2 options of pictures : high quality or low quality. You also have a flash that you can put on or off. The installation is quite simple. DON'T PLUG IN THE CAMERA BEFORE YOU RUN THE CD!! Worst thing to do for any camera, it messes up everything. I installed the cd first, then rebooted, it recognized the new hardware. 

t worked like a charm and if IIII Didn't have problems, you won't cause I'm an idiot at computers lol :) (just push the usb wire deep inside if not you'll see PC written on the cam but it won't detect it... it took me couple minutes to figure it out) Also, it comes with little programs you can install to work with it.. didn't go over all of them cause I just got the cam, but they look ok.

Ok the negative points here... The camera comes with a little thing to put it inside and also with a stand. They didn't think when they built it. The stand goes under the cam but it's not in the middle.. so if your batteries are inside well... it won't stay there. Also, it doesn't fit on my screen so I had to put it on my speaker and it's ok but it was just not well thought. 

P.S It's sure that it's not hi hi hi quality but it's good :) Like everybody says: you get what you paid for! hehe If you will to pay more, do it, you'll get something way better for 30 dollars more but if it's only for fun well, take this one. It does the job and it's very practical when you want to go out with friends, you can take approximatively 70 good quality pictures and 140 low quality pictures. I think it's a good buy. I didn't want scrap and I'm quite happy with what I got even though I know it's not what is the best on the market... Remember that a webcam is fun for a while if it's only for chatting but after that, it'll stay on your computer. If you get tired of chatting, well at least you've got something to take pictures outside of the house! Think about it!
