            This SUV offers you just about everything you need for around $30,000. Very few SUVs can have that claim.
1. Power: At 240 hp and 265 lb ft of torque, this is truly remarkable for a 3.5liter V6. These numbers are comparable to other SUVs with V8s.
2. The interior: The leather package is just pure luxury. The quality of the leather is soft, durable, and very elegant. The dash is classy, yet functional. The simulated wood adds that last touch to detail. The controls are very well placed, for the temperature control, audio, moonroof, and mirrors are well placed and can be reached without having to lean. 
The seats are very comfortable, the heated seats are always welcome in the winter, and the two way memory seats is an added bonus.
The rear offer plenty of room for three adults. The trunk is spacious. The rear seat folds down easily for added room
The BOSE audio system is one of the best factory stereo systems I have ever listened to. It comes with a very convenient in dash 6 cd changer and a tape player.
3. The ride: The short answer would be "IT DRIVES LIKE A CAR", but there is more to that. You can take U turns with ease, better than some cars actually, the ride is smooth, power is definitely more than enough. 
The acceleration is great for an SUV, it handles extremely well, with very little roll thanks to its massive Toyo tires. The brakes are strong, and easy to apply. You get excellent visibility for both sides and rear. This SUV does not drive like an SUV, more like a refined sedan.
4. Design: The Pathfinder body designed has not changed much since 1999. It is rather conservative in my opinion, when compared to the Acura MDX, Lexus RX300, and several other newcomers to the SUV arena.
