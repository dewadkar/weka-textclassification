            Let me start off by saying that the Range Rover is a great SUV. I am the previous owner both the Land Cruiser and Jeep Grand Cherokee, and I can now say that the Range Rover is the best of the group. The truck offers unsurpassed luxury, stability, and comfort, yet still has many problems, which help characterize it as overpriced and over-hyped. 

Hmm. Where do I begin? 

Lets start with the brakes. The brakes are good, but not great. I would have to say that although the brakes are better than the Cherokee, they pale in comparison to the Land Cruiser. I know that the �official� numbers may dictate otherwise, but I can only speak from experience. The Range Rover brakes are nothing to get excited about, although they (hopefully!) will get the job done. 

Economy. Let�s face it; the Range Rover is probably one of the least fuel-efficient vehicles on the road. In fact, last time I checked on my nifty on board computer, my consumption was a mere 12.2-MPG! Yes, I know that this is luxury vehicle, however, even from an environmental standpoint this fuel �economy� is atrocious. I won�t even go into how much extra it will cost you at a time when gas prices are 25% higher than where they were at this time last year. 

Layout. After reading many reviews of the Range Rover, no one really goes into detail about the ridiculous vehicle layout. In order to lock the car, one must press down on the lock switch by the door. There is no such thing as a power lock button! This, to me, is a pretty basic amenity that is lacking on a $60,000 automobile. Also, I don�t get why the window buttons are backwards�talk about confusing! My vehicle has the optional navigation system installed. I declare it worthless, not only because of its poor performance, but also because of its location. It is almost impossible to see the TINY screen from the drivers seat. I don�t understand why they would put it so far away�

Power. As you have seen above, I am not a fan of the fuel economy. Well, with terrible economy, one would at least expect that the performance would be great. That is not the case. I admittedly own the less-powerful 4.0 SE, but the torque on this truck is comical. Anything from a Durango to a RAV 4 outpaces me, and for this I am ashamed. 

I will now stop complaining about the shortcomings of the car, and will end with some of the positive aspects. The Range Rover is the nicest looking SUV on the road. Inside the vehicle, there is the most commanding view of the road that I have ever seen, due to the placement of the seats. The standard Air-Suspension system is too cool to describe. The Range Rover is also one of the safest vehicles on the road, partially as a result of its aluminum construction. 

So do I recommend that you buy a Range Rover? Of course! The above is just meant to serve as a warning, so that you shouldn�t fall into the same trap as me and think that the Range Rover is flawless like I did before buying it. Understand the shortcomings, and then realize that it is nevertheless the best SUV out there. If you do this, I promise that you�re time of ownership will be the best years of you�re life�
