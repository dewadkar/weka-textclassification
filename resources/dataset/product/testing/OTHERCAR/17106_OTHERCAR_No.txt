            This is one of the worst cars we've ever owned and I can't wait to get rid
of it. To make a long story short soon after we bought our ml320 problems started to surface on a weekly basis. Let me list a few:
1-front windshield cowl rattles
2-dashboard rattles and squeaks
3-air leaks from all 4 doors
4-shifter rattles
5-don't open the windows half way because you guessed it, they rattle.
6-back seats rattle constantly
7-cruise control has a loose spring that rattles all the time
8-moon roof crinkles and squeaks (it's driving my wife crazy)
9-automatic door locks are making the weirdest noises.
10-wind noise...what?? I can't hear you honey.
11-....etc

Take it to the dealer you say. 6 trips to the dealer and they can't fix anything except item 1. I've managed to stuff felt in the dashboard and the doors and that helped a bit. So I thought I should have a regional manager take a look at this car. Here's the final response I got from them after spending 3hrs at the dealer. &quot; this is not a $100,000 mercedes&quot;. I was speechless. I thought and still thinks that $45,000 should buy a pretty good vehicle. Anyway, I am so dissapointed by the quality of MB that I made it a point to spread the word and hopefully people we'll research and do their homework first before they fall into the trap.

ps. you might want to check out what consumer report had to say about the 
ml320. If you really like your ml320, I don't recommend reading that consumer report.
