            I had been looking for an SUV for some time and researched extensively the many possibilities that I was considering. My conclusion was that the Suzuki Grand Vitara almost perfectly fit what I was looking for in a new vehicle. Previously I have owned an Isuzu 4x4 Pickup, and an old '84 Suburu wagon. So I had grown to love the benefits of 4 wheel drive, but wanted something modern and a bit more user friendly. Enter the GV. The price was right, the features were more than I could ask for, the look was very cool and tuff for a mini-SUV, the size promises better gas mileage as well as more maneuverability on and off-road. Plus Suzuki had a reputation for making tough trucks.

I finally purchased a gold Grand Vitara 2 weeks ago. It was new but a '99 so I was able to haggle with the dealer for a decent price. It came loaded with the ABS brakes and alloy wheels and a 5 speed manual transmission. My impressions of it so far are as follows:

1. I love the gold colour and grow more fond of it everyday. It has a cool greenish tint to it. The finish quality of the exterior is top notch and refined looking for the price.

2. The gas mileage is pretty good for an SUV. I get around 20-22 miles a gallon. I was able to drive from Salt Lake City  to Bear Lake Utah and back on a single tank. Mileage is slightly less now with my bike rack on top. Bike racks . . . you need to stand on the open door frames to secure your bikes to the rack. This is common for SUV's.

3. The engine compartment is laid out beautifully and easy to access the major fluid compartments. The V6 engine has decent power. I can pass on the highway with no problem, but on big hills and with a full load you need to turn off the AC and downshift to 4th gear to maintain your speed. With this combination, I was able to pass many other SUV�s while driving up Parley�s Canyon from Salt Lake City to Park City Utah. When starting off the line, the GV�s engine gives you that typical truck torque huevos rather than sports car speed. Do not fear, for the engine kicks in something fierce around 3000 RPM�s. You�ll be at the next stop light before you know it.

4. The rear view is severely distracted not by the spare tire, but by the back seat head rests, luckily the large side view mirrors help in this area. The front windshield and side windows make me think I�m in an Imax theatre.

5. The seats are firm and a little narrow. This is not a bad thing since I am of average build and the side bolstering holds you in place, but I can see a large person being uncomfortable in them. According to my friends, the back seats were comfortable during a 5 hour drive. Interior noise is pretty quiet and the whole vehicle feels solid when going over bumpy roads. Cornering is not too scary in the GV, with body lean being kept in check with the stabilizer bar in the engine compartment. The inside finish adds to the ride comfort with nice soft fabric and a solid and refined interior with clean lines that is modern and well put together. The dashboard layout is easy to use. Everyone says that the radio buttons are too small. This is a joke because all radios have tons of small knobs and buttons, so get over it. I do wish that there was lighted slider knobs for nighttime climate control adjustments. The same goes for the power window and lock buttons. I appreciate the left foot rest next to the clutch.

6. The back seats are easy to take down when I need extra storage space, and the rear door opens nice and slow and offers easy access to the back.

7. The GV drives wonderfully. It has plenty of power. Steering is lively which translates into constant adjustments when driving highway speeds, but really aids the handling when you hit the dirt and throw it into 4 wheel drive. During my first weekend up at Bear Lake Utah,I took the GV through its paces off-road, from twisting dirt roads to tough/rocky low gear stuff. the GV ate it up and pleaded for more. It has a definite truck feel and very stiff suspension. I personally love this kind of ride quality, but realize that some people just aren�t satisfied unless they are riding in a Lexus. On a trip down to Lake Powell in southern Utah last weekend, I was able to fit 4 adults and enough gear for 4 days on the lake. During the drive down, we encountered some of the most ferocious wind and dust storms I�ve ever been in. I had to have two hands on the steering wheel and was blown around quite a bit, but felt secure and confident in these extreme conditions.

8. I had to take the GV into the dealer to fix some loose air vents (warranty covered) and buy some floor mats. Totally lame that vehicles don�t come with these standard, especially on the top of the line JLX+. I also wish there was a darker window tint. I plan on eventually getting some bigger more aggressive off-road tires and a bit more undercarriage protection. Some fog lights would be worth it too, everything else is just window dressing and clutters up the already killer body style.<br><br>
