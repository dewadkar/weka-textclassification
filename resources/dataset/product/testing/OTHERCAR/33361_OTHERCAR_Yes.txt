            When I moved to California from Canada in December of 1998, I was in need of a new car.  After looking at several car models, the Volkswagen new Jetta was the one that stuck in my mind.  (Well others did too, but I couldn't afford a BMW yet.)

My final decision came down to two Jetta models: a 1999 (old style) Jetta GLX or a 1999 (new style) Jetta GLS.  The great new styling of the new Jetta won me over so I drove off in the 1999 Jetta GLS.  I would have preferred to have gotten a GLX model of the new body style, but because the model was just becoming available, only limited versions of the new Jetta GL and GLS were available.

Down to the details.

Volkswagen did a great job in the redesign of the Jetta.  The car is has much more smoother lines and looks line a more expensive German sedan.  The Jetta is much like a 3/4 size Passat, but with a much more attractive front-end.  The car is unmistakably Volkswagen with the large signature VW logos front and back.

I think one of the main selling points of the car was the blue instrumentation lighting.  (You have to see the interior at night, it looks great!  So many people have raved about the blue color.)  All of the controls are lit in red and are clearly visible at night.

Aside from the instrumentation, VW added several nice touches to the interior of the GLS model.  Power express-up/down front windows (both driver and passenger), tilt AND telescoping steering wheel, and a good sounding 8-speaker standard stereo system are a few of these features that are rarely found as standard equipment on similarly priced cars.  In terms of safety, VW scores high points with driver and passenger front AND side airbags.

Having driven this car for a year and a half now, I think that I have gotten to know the good and bad about this car.  My only complaints are about the 2.0L, 4-cylinder engine that comes standard on the GL and GLS models and the automatic transmission.  The engine is fairly peppy, but you can often feel like the car is dying for more power when the air conditioning is on.  And at highway cruising speed, you can definitely hear all 115 horses moving the car along. The new 1.8L turbo or the 2.8L V6 are definitely recommended engines if you are looking for more get up and go.  As for the automatic transmission, it sometimes has a difficult time deciding when to change gears resulting in abrupt shifts sometimes.  It also has a delayed shift into gear when moving from reverse to drive, sometimes causing a jerky start when hitting the gas to go.

The good points about the car is that it still has the solid feel to it that it did when I first drove it off the lot. (I have almost 24,000mi on the car now)  The car handles decently on all road types and conditions and is still a pleasure to drive around the corner and on long road-trips.

The only problems that I have to report with my car are with the driver's power window switch and the remote trunk release on the keychain.  The power window has a mind of it's own sometimes.  I push down, it goes up or express-down, depending on it's mood.  The first time I had the technicians look at the window, they thought I was crazy because, of course, the window was in a good mood.  As for the trunk release, sometimes I have to be right in front of the trunk before the trunk will open, or just give up and use the key.

My overall experience with the car has been very good and I would definitely buy another Jetta or a Volkswagen product again.  You get a lot of bang for your buck and will likely enjoy the car for several years.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is get a Jetta with either the 1.8L turbo or the 2.8L V6 engine with a 5-speed manual transmission.<br><br>
