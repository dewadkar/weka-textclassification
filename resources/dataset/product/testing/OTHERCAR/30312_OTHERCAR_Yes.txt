            If you are looking for a car that has it all, look no further. The 1999 Subaru Legacy SUS has all of the best qualities from every type of car.

Is This A Sport Utility?
Yes definately. With its sturdy frame, wrap around bumpers and all wheel drive system, you can take on anything from your daily life activities, to camping in the mountains, or a weekend in blizzard country. Or just flip on those fancy fog lights in the worse fog.

What about a Sports Car?
If you are looking for a standard transmition you are out of luck. But when it comes to power, the SUS has 2.5 lt engine with 165 hp. providing plenty of power for the person with the need to speed. A stylish rear spoiler, and air intake, this vehicle is all sport.

What if You are Looking For a Luxury Vehicle?
No problem here, with leather interior, keyless entry, moonroof, an upgraded stereo system with cd player, wood grain trim, and most importantly an accessively smooth ride, even at high speeds.

What Else Does it Have?
Well to start for the winter, I know I love sitting on my heated seats. I use to hate when my windshield wipers were iced, you would just smear everything on your window, and accomplish nothing. Not anymore with the added windshield wiper deicer. Fogged driver/passenger mirrors, not anymore with mirror defoggers (fog be gone). Added safety includes dual air bags, abs breaks all wheel drive.

And Yes what about accidents.
Unfortuantely I had the experience of being in an accident with my new subaru recently luckily no one was hurt, and I attribute that to the safety features of my subaru. With dual air bags, and the well designed cab forward, as well as the frontal impact zone, you cant go wrong with safety. And dont forget about the AWD. Better than 4WD in that it is computer controlled and in subarus, if one tire is slipping the other tires can compensate by adjusting their spin control individually.
