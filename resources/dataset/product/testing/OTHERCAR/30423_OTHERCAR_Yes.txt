            It's been two years now that I've owned my 1992 NX-1600.  My earlier car was an old 1986 Tercel I had to replace, given its old age.  I looked for a good, sporty, quality car for months and did not find what I was looking for.  One day, I looked at a newspaper classified ad that said: &quot;White Nissan NX-1600, T-Tops, 120 000 km, good condition.&quot;  My first reaction was: &quot;What's that?  Name looks impressive...&quot;  So what did I do?  With my curious nature, I had to call and find out.  After all, the car had T-Tops, which meant it was sporty...

When I arrived at the appointment with the seller, I immediately fell in love with the car.  The design, of course, was not conventional for a 1992, but I thought it looked like earlier 1998 models, with rounder curves.

I love this car for its handling.  I can take curves at speeds I would never even have dreamed of with my Tercel.  It sits low, with a quite rigid suspension, which helps it corner and still hug the road.  In harsh Quebec weather, it also works quite well.  The car handles great in it and it's even a blast to drive in winter.  The car starts fine, even at -35 degrees Celsius.

In the interior, everything is driver oriented.  The &quot;Tokyo By Night&quot; digital display lights up in the night enhancing the driving experience.  The radio sits high on the dashboard so you don't have to bend over to change channels.  The shifter is quite short, helping you make quick gear changes.  The tilt steering wheel helps you find that angle that suits you fine, and the fan and heater controls are also easy to reach.

Even though some of you seem to think that it is too small for tall people, I believe it suits me fine and I am 6' tall.  Of course this is far from a family car and I did not buy it to carry people in the back.  It helps once in a while, but only for short trips.  Mostly, the two front seats are used.

I bought this car at 128 000 km and it is now at 209 000 km and it still runs like new!  This little car is quite a marathon runner if you ask me!  The only problem I had with the car, other than regular maintenance was the radio-cassette tuner.  For some reason, the heat got to it and it would stop on its own.  However, I changed it last summer for a Panasonic tuner and cd-receiver and everything works perfectly (and is even better!).

Overall, this is a good car, if you like sporty cars and not want to look like you're driving what everybody else is driving.  The T-Tops?  They come off every single time I drive in the summer (except when it rains, of course!).  While everybody is sweating in traffic, I am enjoying the sun and having a nice tan!  Also, on country roads, nothing's comparable to the feeling!

My motto for this car is: &quot;We all have to go from point A to point B.  Why not have fun doing it!&quot; (I know it's a rip off from an ad, but I liked it!).

I would recommend this car for anyone who likes a good driving experience.  However, use it as a two-seater, more than a four-seater, since the back seat is quite uncomfortable, which makes this car a little less practical for families.  Remember: it's a sports car, not a family car!<br><br>
