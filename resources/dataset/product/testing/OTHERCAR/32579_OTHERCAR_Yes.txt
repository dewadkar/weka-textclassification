            The summer before my junior year in high school in 2003, my dad and I finally set out to buy my first car.  We needed something reliable, affordable, long-lasting, safe, and my requirement, cute!  

The 1997 Saturn SL2 was a perfect choice for me.  What made it even MORE appealing is that it only had 37,000 miles in comparison to other cars from the same year that had around 80,000 miles.  Basically my dad and I were choosing from Chevy Cavaliers and Saturns.  We found that the Saturns had much lower insurance rates, and were a much smoother ride.

Once I took my Saturn for a test drive, I knew it was the right car.  It rode so smooth in comparison to the other cars that we test-drove.

I've had my Saturn for 6 months now, and I haven't encountered one problem yet. (knock on wood)  I love cruising around town in my cute little gold Saturn, and my parents feel very comfortable with me driving on my own because of the reliability of my car.

I'm of small-stature (approx. 5'3 and with a petite frame) so the Saturn fits me perfectly, but my parents often moan about it hurting their backs when they ride with me.  However, my friends have never complained (my friends that have ridden with me are my size).  Basically I think the Saturn is designed for smaller people.

My only complaint is that my car has a little trouble going up steep hills... I can hear her chuggin' along when she's trying to go up hills.  Besides that, the ride is very smooth.

Other perks that are nice that came with my model- power windows and locks (my friends are very jealous of that feature!), keyless entry, keyless entry to the trunk, and a sunroof.  I also just got a CD player installed (mine only came with a tape-player) so I'm loving that!  

I couldn't tell you much about the engine or gas-mileage because I don't know much about that, my dad seems to think that I get really good gas-mileage.

Basically, parents or teens, if you're looking for a good first car, I would definitely recommend a Saturn.  I've been nothing but thrilled with my car, and I definitely plan to have my Saturn for a long time.
