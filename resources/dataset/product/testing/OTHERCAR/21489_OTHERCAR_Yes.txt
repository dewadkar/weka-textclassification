            I always wanted a Grand Prix, so when the opportunity to purchase this 1997 Grand Prix GTP presented itself, I had to jump!  It was a lease trade-in so the prior owners had taken really good care of it.  There are so many things I love about this car.  It's fast- with a super-charged engine I can get up to speed on the freeway in seconds. My friends with Mustangs always comment on how my car could outrun theirs! It's sporty- I always get compliments on my car.  It's safe- it has a drop-down engine, air bags, and the wider traction really is better.  My favorite feature of the Grand Prix is the heads-up display.  If you're not familiar with this, as you're driving, the speed is projected onto the windshield so you see it as though it were in front of you on the road.  No more looking down at the speedometer.  The stereo controls on the steering wheel are another great feature.
The only downside I've seen so far is that when things break down, they are expensive to fix.  My fuel pump went out recently and because of the way it sits in the engine, it was very costly to replace due to the additional labor.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this car and I'm looking to buy a new Grand Prix Sedan.
