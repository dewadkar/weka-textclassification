            This camera has helped my family and I with a number of things. Its literally as easy as 1.2.3. I purchased this product because I wanted to take pictures of the family and put them on the web along with many other things. You can take a picture and record up to 60 seconds of sound to go with the picture. It has an email mode that lets you take pictures for the fastest email downloads. You can also take a disk of pictures you love and copy them to for your relative to enjoy. It also comes with a video mode. Instead of film it uses floppy disks and you can store up anywhere from 3 to 30 pictures depending on the resolution you have it on. You can guarantee that your shot will be steady with the feature &quot;Steady Shot&quot;. One thing that isn't enjoyable about this camera is that after you snap your picture it takes about 30 seconds to load on the screen of the camera. The camera makes it easy for you to take pictures of yourself. If you buy this camera I suggest that you should also get a picture viewer that lets you edit your pictures becuase some of the pictures that I have taken come out dark even though theres flash. This camera is fun and a real attention getter.<br><br>
