            The Land Rover Discovery is one of the best off-road vehicles you can buy on the planet today.  Virtually unstoppable, the Discovery can be found on the highways and country clubs of America to the jungles of Brazil to the bush of Swaziland to the autobahn of Germany to the crowded streets of Manila.  I've had a Discovery since 1995 and it's been a very interesting journey over these past five years.

First off, the vehicle is not cheap - just like most SUVs the Discovery is on the mid-thirties.  Not exactly a price that you want to take out into the hills and run through mud bogs with.  Major 30,000 Mile Scheduled maintenance costs about $650, so there's no cost savings there.  And your 23 gallon gas tank gets about 300 miles to the tank.  One the East Coast, the price of gas has fluctuated from about $1.45/ga to $1.10/ga, this translates into roughly $32/tank to $21/tank.  I've put over 115,000 miles on my Disco - you can do the math because I can no longer afford my accountant!

What is truly lame about the Discovery is Land Rover itself.  With a serious off-road and built to destroy the world reputation behind it, Land Rover North America chose to position itself as the blue-blood, WASP-y, high-class, richman's vehicle and have jacked the prices in America accordingly.  New Discovery's are richly appointed with heated electric leather seats, wood grain paneling, cruise control, plush carpeting, car park door opener and a boat load of luxury items.  In England and elsewhere, a Discovery can be had for about US$20,000 - although without the luxury appointments and without the V8 short block engine. Other regions of the world have to do with more spartan appointments and a 4cylinder TDI diesel engine (that reputedly will last for 400,000 miles).

Personally speaking, I'd rather see less appointments and a better price, but Americans are so into being pampered and luxury and that's why we always have to pay a ridiculous premium for the vehicles we want - like the $30Gs for an SUV.

That said, remember that this is a BRITISH VEHICLE. Do not expect the same old, cookie cutter line reliability that Toyotas are known for.  Expect the strange and often puzzling quirkinesses of a British made vehicle.  For some reason, in spite of their consistent back slapping about how they colonized the world, the British just can't seem to get the finer points of automobile manufacture down.  Strange electrical problems, technical problems or whatever.  

In the past five years, I've had just about every strange and bizarre problem that one could have.  I've been stranded in New York City in front of the Empire State Building at 3am on Thanksgiving weekend because the automatic shifter refused to shift out of park.  I've had the vehicle break down and the alternator blow up right after visiting the dealership for a servicing, the sunroofs made strange noises that sounded like they were about to jettison themselves, the windshield has leaked for years and no one has ever been able to solve that problem and the piece de resistance - the dashboard laminate has decided to peel up looking like some strange, British brown surf break happening on my dashboard - something that the dealer has told me will be $1200 to replace.  I guess since LRNA has positioned themselves as the rich man's car, they can charge a rich man's ransom to fix things.

But, I'm not your average WASP-y house mom taking the Discovery to the market and to pick up the kids from Prep School.  I've taken this vehicle all over - I'd love to say Hell And Back, but I haven't taken this one to the Artic Circle like some people I know - darn.  From Flying down the New Jersey Turnpike at 85mph (and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SPEED - OR HIGHER), to destroying the wilderness at George Washington National Forest, to playing battle tanks with New York City Taxis to Ice Storms in Freeport Maine to blizzards and ice fishing in Vermont - the Discovery has been truly KICK ASS!  Nothing (perhaps short of the 4 ft snow drifts during the blizzard of 1996) stops this vehicle.  While all lesser 4x4s and SUVs are laid to the wayside, this thing charges right past them.  Snow is no problem, mud is no problem, winching trees out of your way is no problem.  Nothing is a problem - until you buy gas.

In spite of the strange dichotomy between it's appointments, the rest of the Disco - i.e. Drivetrain, Chassis, Engine, Tranny - are just bulletproof.  This thing just tears up anything in it's path and it's built more solidly than anything else on the road today - perhaps the Hummer can make the same claim, but the rest like Mercedes, Lexus, Ford, et al, they are pansies compared to the brute force of the Disco.

But how does it drive?  Very nice.  Personally, I like a truck kind of feel to it and LR has balanced the Disco nicely with some auto and truck feeling.  I feel quite comfy travelling at 75mph on the freeway with lots more oooomph to spare from the v8 engine and it feels great for city driving too.  I've done long trips, short trips and anything in between with no problem.  Seat ergonomics are great and very comfortable.  Unlike the Japanese SUVs like the Pathfinder, Xterra and 4Runner, in the Discovery you are not sitting on the floor with your legs becoming fatigued.

Overall, I cannot recommend this vehicle enough.  However, a healthy dose of understanding and thought should accompany the purchase of a Discovery.  Realise that this is not a cheap vehicle to operate - depending on your use, gas and scheduled maintenance can become considerable factors.  Like for myself with 120,000 miles in five years, thats at least 4 scheduled maintenances at $650 a pop - something to consider.  But if you only drive 15,000 miles or less a year, it's not really that bad.  Plus, understand that this is a British vehicle and they always have weird quirkinesses to them that just don't seem right to us Yanks (and the rest of the free world), but you love the vehicle just the same.  That's the way to enjoy Land Rover Ownership.  Plus, you can commiserate with other understanding Land Rover Owners and listen to their great tales of adventure.

If you buy a used Disco - definitely try to get all the service records with the vehicle - hopefully, you will have bought the vehicle from someone reputable enough to have kept them and you and your mechanic can understand the history of the vehicle.  And find yourself a great mechanic.  I've just found myself a new one and I heartily recommend him - drop me a line if you'd like to know more.

A friend of mine works for LRNA in Maryland and he listens and tells me about other problems he's seen and heard about - as well as telling me stories on how they destroyed the cheap and cheesy Mercedes Benz SUV on their Off-Road Course.  While the Discovery has had some problems, the new DiscoveryII seems to be really a recovery for LR.  Perhaps this is BMW influence on the company, but things are really looking up with the Series II.

Happy Driving!
