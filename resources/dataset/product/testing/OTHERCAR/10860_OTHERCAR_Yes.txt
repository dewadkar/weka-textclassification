            When I moved here to Georgia last year, I met a sweetheart of a guy who becamse one of my best friends.  Because I was not sure of a lot of the area, I let him do most of the driving around in his <b>1997 Nissan Pathfinder</b> and we drove all over the Atlanta Metro area all summer long as he showed me the sites and got me familiar with the back roads of this area.

The <b>1997 Nissan Pathfinder</b> is a great, durable, all purpose family vehicle.  My friend's got two young sons, both under the age of four and we've had two car seats in the back seat of this vehicle with no problems at all.  The Pathfinder runs absolutely quiet and manuevers well on surface streets as well as on the Interstate.  More importantly, since this was the summertime, the air conditioning of the Pathfinder was screamingly cold and we thoroughly needed that during the Hotlanta weather we have around here.

One thing that I found utterly delightful about the <b>1997 Nissan Pathfinder</b> is that it holds an incredible amount of cargo.  We had to pack up my friend's home this past summer and move him, and we were able to get tools and tons of huge boxes in the car without problems.  I was SO impressed with the Pathfinder that when I was looking for a new car this summer, I looked at the 2000 models to consider them for purchase.  However, the only reason why I did not purchase a new Pathfinder was that my son was not comfortable in the passenger side of this vehicle.  I'm assuming that the interior size of the vehicle has been reduced because my friend stands a good 6 ft 4 inches tall and he has no problems driving this vehicle.

The <b>1997 Pathfinder</b> has a 3.3 L, 168 @4800rpm horsepower engine which gets probably about 19 MPG in the city.  It was equipped with automatic transmssion, air conditioning, AM/FM/Cassette stereo, Keyless entry, Anti-lock brakes, and power windows.  

The only thing that I can find &quot;wrong&quot; with his Pathfinder is that when he has the two car seats for his kids in the back seat that there's really not much room in there for an adult to sit back there with the kids.  His sister who is a tall woman (over 6 ft tall) tried to sit with the kids in there on a trip and even though she &quot;survived&quot; back there, I could tell that she was rather uncomfortable.

Even so, if my friend wanted to sell his Pathfinder, I would buy it in a minute!  It's a really fun vehicle to drive and ride in and I highly recommend it to you all.<br><br>
