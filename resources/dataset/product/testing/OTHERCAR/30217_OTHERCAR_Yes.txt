            I didn't want a minivan. I wanted something cool. So I got a Subaru Forester, even though we were planning a family. I thought "well, carseats will fit in it, no big deal." I was wrong. Two kids later I dragged my husband minivan shopping. I mourned the death of my image as I pictured myself turning into the stereotypical "mom in a minivan."

After doing some reading on the 'net and in Consumer Reports, and speaking with the five neighbors who drive minivans on my street, and reading the forums at odyclub.com too, I decided I wanted an Ody. I had to convince my husband it was worth paying sticker price, but I did it.

Driving: 
I don't see what the big deal is. It drives great. Just like most of the other cars I have driven except an old Ford that belonged to my grandma which sucked. It handles well in snow/ice and rain. Really, it's smooth and has a lot of pickup! I never sit there and yell "shift, shift" at the automatic transmission like I have done in some cars. I calculate my mileage out routinely, and I get about 19 mi/gal (I do mostly suburban driving in residential areas, some highways).Also, I have a very bad back (herniated disc years ago) and am often quite uncomfortable after driving for half an hour. I can drive this car for hours without discomfort! The van is also very quiet. Road sounds and engine sounds and stuff like that are not an issue in this minivan.
 
Interior: 
I have an EX-L trim model with leather seats and DVD player.  Aside from me personally liking the leather seats, its easy to clean if my 2 year old spills something. There are lots of little storage spaces hidden everywhere which is great.  The climate control and stereo controls are no problem at all for me to reach, although my husband who is several inches shorter than I am (I'm 5'10" with very long arms and legs, he's 5'6" with short arms and legs) comments that the control for the rear a/c is a stretch for him. This model also has a few stereo controls on the steering wheel, but for some reason I rarely if ever use them. Habit, I guess, I just reach over to the dashboard controls, it's really no stretch at all so no biggie. The climate control never needs adjustment while I'm driving so reaching that isn't an issue. The only climate control thing I ever have had to change while driving is the rear blower - sometimes my 2 year old wants to "cool down his hair" or "warm up his hair" or something, and I have to adjust it for him. That's the control that my husband finds a little bit of a stretch. Oh, and I also got an under-seat CD changer which leaves under the driver's seat. The only thing I miss from my Subaru is the in-dash 6 CD changer, but having it under my seat is ok. Oh, one other thing I missed from my Subaru was the compass and temperature display, so I swapped out the rear view mirror in the Ody for an aftermarket model with a compass and temperature display. Now I feel right at home!

I also love the "magic seat" for cargo. I will never forget the day we stopped at home depot unexpectedly. We had our 2 year old and 4 month old in the 2nd row. We ended up buying SO much stuff - plants, DRYWALL, I don't even remember. We just folded down the bench and loaded up and everything fit. Incredible. 

Speaking of the kids - the car seat install was a breeze. I love the LATCH system. We have used a Britax Roundabout (forward facing), a Graco Snugride (rear facing) and a Britax Advantage (rear facing) in the minivan, and all installations went great and were certified by a carseat tech as excellent installs. MUCH easier than in some other cars - the height of the van means no bending to take the infant seat in/out, too.

Exterior: 
Well, mine is a nice color - sagebrush pearl. It looks like a minivan. What is there to say about that? You can't hide it. It's big. The way the doors open automatically is cool though. My sister-in-law says it is like a space shuttle! Hee hee.

Recommendation: 
Get it. All the formerly cool kids are doing it. You won't be sorry. I can't remember exactly how much we paid - it was close to list price, maybe $400 less since we haggled and got some free accessories (leather steering wheel cover and a couple of things like that).
