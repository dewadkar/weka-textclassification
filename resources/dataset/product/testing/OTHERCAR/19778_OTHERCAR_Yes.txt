            My husband and I used to own a Suburu Loyale and we absolutely loved it!! It was a baby blue four door '92. It was bought inexpensively and we drove the tires off that car. My father-in-law bought this car and gave to my husband for college, and he drove it all through college! The thing I loved most about that vehicle was its dependability. It rarely broke down on us, and we knew we could count on it. It was a quiet car with maneuverability unlike anything. The only thing I didn't like about this car was that it was a stick shift, but you can get them in automatics. If you are looking for a luxury car, this really is not for you. Anyone looking for a dependable car that gets GREAT gas mileage should definitely look into getting a Suburu.<br><br>
