            Hey, my first and only car so far is a 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and I love it because it's a tank. It feels good to scare all those wimps in the compacts, sub-compact, and wimpy trucks. But I want to say that if you have a car that is a tank, use it or lost it. I am tired of sitting behind people (especially old people) with large Oldsmobiles, Chryslers, and Ford Crown Victorias creeping around at 5 miles an hour and driving scares. If you cannot drive, get off the road. The bus is cheaper! But my mom owns my dream car right now, it's a Ford Expedition, which is even a bigger tank. <br><br>
