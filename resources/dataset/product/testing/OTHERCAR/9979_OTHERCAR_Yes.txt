            I bought my 1990 Nissan Sentra about 2 years ago. I had just turned 16 and it was my first car.  It had hail damage all over it, and about 175,000 miles on it; but it sure performed well and had a good engine in it.  I have gotten everything I expected out of this car and it is still going strong!

Performance - It is a 4-speed manual. I can outperform most other cars at traffic lights! It's fuel injected and performs very well. I can go about 300 miles on one tank... good gas mileage.

Comfort - I'm 6'1&quot; and I hit my head on the ceiling a bit. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone taller than me. The seatbelts are a bit awkward at first but you get used to them.  There is plenty of trunk space and plenty of room for 4 people (getting 5 in there is kind of hard, but I have done it a few times)

Look - It's an early 90's look.  If you would have subtracted the hail damage from mine it still looks decent


The car is just now beginning to rust on me.  I suspect it would have been better in a garage but there was none available here.  A few preventantive measured would have helped also.

All in all this is a good car.  I would highly recommend it for a beginning driver. It is cheap and runs well.  It is a workhorse!  I was and still am happy with this purchase - even with the mileage.  There has been very little brake - engine work done on it.  


<b>Update!</b> - It's been a while since I wrote this! I now have over 200,000 miles on this car and it is still going strong. I have no plan on selling it in the near future. <br><br>
