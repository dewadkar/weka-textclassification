            I used to own an AWD 1993 Mistubishi Eclipse GSX and that's what I am mainly going to compare it to.

This review is for the 3.0 Liter V6 stock engine, not the DOHC or Twin Turbo.

The Eclipse I got was a bit of a mystery. I think someone had rolled it. The top of the roof had some indents that were obviously fixed at one point and the doors didn't have the standard GSX power locks....Hmmmm. New Doors?

I mainly wanted a car and I wanted a GSX and I got one. Overall I can imagine that the GSX NEW would be a serious thrill ride. The car handled immaculate and the power was great, especially on the highway when trying to pass someone. I loved the AWD and it makes a huge difference when cornering fast while punching the throttle. Mine was a bit beat up but it looked good and it got looks. Full limo tint, chrome rims, the whole kit and kaboodle.

After I sold it for $300 less than I paid for it, I felt like it was the only car that I'd ever want. I sold it because it was having a problem that no one could fix. It seems to studder and run like garbage for no good reason. Then it would go back to normal. I think it needed a new computer but WOW, I was not going to buy that.

On to the Stealth.

Right away I noticed that I had gotten a better deal. The interior was mint. Almost TOO mint. The seats looked BRAND new and this also had Mirror tint and 8 mag wheel, silver rims(Not Chrome!)

The ride was very similar except this base model lacked the rear wheel kick I was used to around corners. It's stock tires that came with the used car are not precisely the correct size. A Stealth can use a 225/55/16 but my tires are a General brand tire at 225/60/16. This makes the tire look a bit larger profile than I was used to. The GSX had 205/55/16 and looked pretty low profile.

If I upgrade to a better tire, such as Yokohama or Toyo. even a few Goodyears, then I'm sure I'll get better handling out of the car. I do have to say that the handling is very nice. Just as good as the Eclipse with a longer wheelbase. The car feels a bit more sturdy and I feel even with the 3.0L V6 SOHC it has better acceleration of the line. Maybe other GSX models were fast of the line, but mine was a bit slow until I hit late 2nd gear.
I have moved from a Stick in the GSX to an Auto in the Stealth. I was simply tired of thinking too much when I was driving. Sometimes I miss the stick, but not very often. I'm going to put a new K&N Filercharger kit on to increase the performance. Gotta do all you can with what u got.
