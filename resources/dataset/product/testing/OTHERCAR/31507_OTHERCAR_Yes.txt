            My wife and I wanted a new car and we did a lot of research before finally deciding on the new 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE. We have had it for just over 6 months, and so far we both love it. It is as roomy as a Civic, has comparable miles per gallon and comes with a 1.8L engine...larger than the Civic. The model we bought, the GXE, is the mid-priced model. We decided that it was a better buy then the lower model because it didn't come with air. The GXE came with power door locks, power windows and mirrors, 4 speaker am/fm/cd, cruise control, air, dual front air-bags, keyless remote entry and a 3/36 bumper to bumper warranty and 5/60 drive train warranty...also better than the Civic. Our drive out price was around $1,4500...you guessed it...cheaper than a Civic.
The Sentra has a very comfortable ride, perfect for long trips, plenty of get-up-and-go for the highway and 40/60 split rear fold down seats.
The basic body style is larger then the 1999 Sentra and we think it looks better too. The other day someone asked me if it was the new Altima.
I will write another review after we have had this car a while, but our first impressions are....we could not be more pleased with this car.<br><br>
