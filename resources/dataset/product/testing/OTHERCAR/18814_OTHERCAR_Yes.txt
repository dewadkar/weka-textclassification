            Why couldn't people understand that I didn't want the Grand Cherokee?  I wanted the streamlined looks of the (plain) Cherokee, it's square and it's cool!  To get the options I wanted we had to find a Limited (leather seats mostly)...  We couldn't be happier!  NO trouble whatsoever with this vehicle.
We have a tow package and all that comes with it.  We get decent mileage and it's just the thing for hauling a trailer with jet skis or a boat or whatever.  Just throw it in the back or on the top rack and you are all set.
I wish the cargo area was a bit bigger, and that the spare wheel could be door mounted or underneath, it does take up some cargo space.
It drives less like a truck than some SUV's I've driven (Ford Explorer). I feel confident in it, but it's easy to park (city) and you don't feel every bump, even in the back seat; I don't call it &quot;a truck&quot;.
 I have a child and it's no biggie to lean over to latch the car seat in the middle.<br><br>
