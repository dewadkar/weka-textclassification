            I'd call my Honda Prelude an ultimate SUV: a sports car that's fun to drive, cost-effective, with plenty of cargo room to boot.

Why I bought this car:
I like sports cars.  They're nimble-footed, stop quickly, and are a bit easier to park than say, a Ford Expedition. My weekend travels take me over tight mountain roads, and I like the assurance of a vehicle that can respond quickly in an emergency.  I do like the utility aspect of 4WDs, but after a friend's Land Rover rolled during an emergency highway maneuver, I decided to hold off on purchasing a 'suburban tank' for now.

I test-drove the Toyota Supra, BMW 328i, and Audi A4, but the Prelude made an immediate favorable impression on me.  Sure, the car was a few thousand cheaper than the other models, but what struck me most was the user-friendly feel of the car, plus the assurance of owning a Honda/Acura, which have always impressed me by their durability of design and low cost of ownership.

It's a sports car...and a Honda.
The Prelude is a different breed of Honda.  With 200 hp, the Honda VTEC engine meets my needs in most driving situations.  Since the power band on this engine starts at 5000 rpm, this isn't a car best suited to quick starts (which is dangerous anyhow), but it delivers power when I need to merge into highway traffic and pass on mountain roads.  And, with this added power, don't be surprised this Honda is less fuel-efficient than the Civic.

Comfortable driving, but tricky when pushed hard.
I really like using this car on long trips.  The seats are very comfortable, and the instrumentation is easy to reach and read, even at night.  It's comforting to know I have that extra power to escape a semi that's aimed at my bumper, and confidence-inspiring that I can navigate tight mountain roads with ease.

This driving ease, however, melts away when the car is pushed to its limits. Front-wheel cars become very touchy when driven like sports cars on tight turns.  While a rear-wheel car's directional aspect can be controlled by minute variations in throttle and steering, the driver of the front-wheel car must over-compensate with steering and throttle to keep the car's angle and direction on track--doing this is as tricky as it sounds. What this means in practical terms is: that if you plan to buy a car to have fun driving mountain roads on the weekend, I think you're better off with a rear-wheeled sports car such as a BMW Z3, Honda S2000, or Porsche Boxster.   

However, gone are the days when I blasted around hairpin turns in the mountains near home.  I outgrew such teenage insanity (you never know what might happen).  However, I still enjoy a car with a practical amount of power and handling that meets all my needs.

Power and handling aside, another great feature of this car is the amount of cargo space it holds.  At first glance, the interior of the Prelude is deceptively small, but when the rear seats are folded down, a surprising transformation occurs.  Now there's enough room for 2 mountain bikes or 3 snowboards plus ample luggage!  Just try that in many other sports cars--it just isn't possible.  This sports car has real utility!

Granted, I've mentioned little on the overall specifications of the car, such as head- and leg-room.  That's because I don't use this information in everyday driving.  I'm 5-10" and this car is very comfortable for me and a passenger, although the back seats are quite cramped (and seldom used).  If you'd like to read more detailed specifications on this car, I'd suggest checking out www.edmunds.com.

What I like less about the Prelude:
If you plan on purchasing the Prelude, you should be aware of a few personality quirks it possesses.  First, get used to the ABS brakes before you really need them--I've learned the hard way.  I was accustomed to cars with tighter, more responsive ABS or conventional brakes.  In my Prelude, I had never used the brakes in an emergency, so when the situation arose, I found I was unprepared. (I was used to really strong brakes) On the plus side, I can say the Prelude's front section crumples nicely to spare the driver any injury.  Considering my Prelude's 'break-in' period, I would suggest experimenting with emergency braking in a safe environment...just to avoid any surprises.

Wash once, then refill.
Another peculiar design on the Prelude is the tiny windshield washer tank.  Perhaps Honda engineers were trying to conserve water, but I usually need a few long sprays to clear the windshield on a long trip.  As it is, the tank empties after a few sprays, forcing me to stop at a station.  

Other than these few quirks, my Prelude has been a fun, practical car, one I dare say for me is an ultimate "SUV".
