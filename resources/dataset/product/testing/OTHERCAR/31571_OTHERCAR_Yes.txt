            I owned a 1993 NSX for one wonderful year, before divorce forced its sale, and I still miss it.  I've had friends who have had the usual &quot;used sports car&quot; experiences with Corvettes and Porsches.

Older NSX's are now coming down into the $35K price range, making the affordable.  Some parts are expensive.  If the factory Bose stereo starts having problems, you might as well chuck the whole system and do an aftermarket install.

Other parts are very reasonable.  I had to have the clutch slave replaced, and it ran me only $250.00 at the dealer.

One major source of woe will be your insurance bill -- $250.00 per month for a &quot;pleasure use only&quot; policy.

One thing you will have in common with Porsche owners is a good friendship with your local tire man.  An NSX can eat up a set of rear tires in as little as 10,000 miles.  Happily, a fix is available from aftermarket provider Comptech, in the form of plates which alter the camber of the rear wheels.  This combined with use of harder compound tires than the factory spec Yokohamas, might get you into 40,000 mile territory with those rear tires.<br><br>
