            Auto Review by Mr. Peter P. Kim 
Senior System Administrator, Oracle DBA, Manual Transmission Lover

Saturday, February 8, 2003 will forever be a special day in my life. I bought my first car that day. Yes, I drove home a 2003 Honda Civic EX Sedan. It was External Blue Pearl, 5-speed manual transmission and had front side air bags. I absolutely love it.

Looking from the outside, the car is absolutely hot. The blue color which I don&#146t see too often on Civics makes it stand out. Until 2003 the Blue Pearl color option was only available on the EX trim. The only blue you could get was that queer-looking teal. Blech. The 15" stock rims are not that bad looking considering the 14" rims on the DX and LX models. I did originally object to the Civic&#146s look (versus the 1996-1999 chassis), but it started to grow on me. With keyless entry, I don&#146t think I&#146ll ever buy another car again without it.

For a 5'11", 200 lb man, sitting in the driver&#146s seat was a pleasure. The first thing I noticed was the dials. It&#146s like waking up from a coma and seeing Jenna Jameson&#146s baby blues for the first time. Wow. The clutch and gear shifter were smooth like a nice Dunhill cigarette. The next thing is the climate control system and the barebones audio. I can&#146t complain as I didn&#146t have money to spruce this up. The sound is adequate, but the heater takes a bit to warm the car up. I can expect the same with the A/C. I drove around for an hour and didn&#146t notice any discomfort, but I know in the long run, the lack of lumbar support will take its toll. I await a road trip.

The back seat was not incredibly pleasant, but it surely beats a 2 door coupe. I can&#146t see three guys my size sit comfortably in the back. It is fantasy island for sure. I would not complain since the Civic was made for the compact size class.

On the road, the ride is bumpier and nosier than expected. I&#146ll remember that when I have money for a luxury car. I love the smooth shifting, as the clutch is lovely, but a 127 horsepower VTEC engine leaves a lot to be desired. I watch movies like the Fast and the Furious but feel mislead. The acceleration on this car is not as quick as I expected, but the handling is pretty crisp. The ABS braking is pretty nice too. You won&#146t see me souping up the car, expecting to drag race though. I need to save my money for gas.

For my first car purchase, I am very happy with my new Civic. With my budget, this car meets my expectations and is fun to drive. Maybe one day I&#146ll be able to drive that elusive Porsche. Until then, this car will be my hooptie to cruise around.
