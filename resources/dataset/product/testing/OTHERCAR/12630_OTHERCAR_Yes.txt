            If your camera is too big, you won't carry it everywhere, but you'll have no worries about this one. It's not much bigger than a big cell phone, and I often put it into my pants pocket with no problems.

The pictures are magnificent, as you'll see by looking at comparative shots on sites like www.pcmag.com and www.clubphoto.com, which offer extensive and accurate reviews.

The biggest problem is the rotary power/selection switch.  It's too easy for the dial to switch by accident when bouncing in a pocket or carrying case. I've had several incidents when the camera got switched on accidentally and burned out lots of the battery before I discovered the problem. 

Some advice: get the recharger/power adapter.  The camera really shouldn't be sold without one, since you won't get more than 50-100 shots without needing new batteries, and each battery costs $10 and can be hard to find.
