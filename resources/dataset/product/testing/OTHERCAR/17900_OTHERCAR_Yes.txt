                          I CAN HONESTLY SAY, I AM STILL IN A DAZE!!!!
I was traveling on Interstate 10 when my car broke down while traveling from Texas.  I decided I wanted another car, so I kept my Toyota Camry, and decided to go for the Gusto!!! Yep, you guessed it....I bought me a 1998 Cadillac Deville.

Even though, I live in Louisiana, I bought my Cadillac in Texas as that was the only place I saw the color I wanted. I had been taking care of my sick sister there and I kept dropping by to see the Cadillacs.

Well, the entire time, I really was just wishing......UNTIL.....I came into some money and my dream came to pass and I bought this Cadillac. Wow, I never dreamed heaven could be on earth.

When I got in this car, I honestly thought I had been RAPTURED and I was in heaven.  As I drove down the highway, I could not believe when I hit bumps how it didn't bother my back a bit.  I had never owned a Cadillac, and couldn't tell you about one, but now I can tell you first handed.  WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!!! It is incredible. This is the question that I keep asking myself, why did I take so long to realize how wonderful they are?????? I always thought Cadillacs were owned by the elderly and the rich.  Well, I now am the proud owner of one and I must say, it is the most wonderful dream that I have ever dreamed that has come true.

I love it and I probably will never go back to anything else.  It is the greatest.....and so roomy,and so beautiful.  Hope you don't wait as long as I did. (Now I own 2 cars, a Toyota Camry and a Cadillac Deville). What more could I ask for??????
