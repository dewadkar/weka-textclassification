            <b>Porsche</b> has been building the <b>911</b> in one form or another (always with improvements, mind you) since the mid Sixties. Each passing year brought more and more refinements and power to the basic 911 shape, but Porsche was always smart enough to leave in those subtle hints that you were driving a <b>911</b>, e.g., the overwhelming tendency for the back end to slide out around hard turns, a nerve wracking situation to the novice, but a necessity for the professional driver. Which brings us to possibly the culmination of decades of research and development of the <b>911</b> when the 1998 <b>911</b> (called the <i>993</i> by the factory) came out. The <i>993</i> was introduced in 1995 and was an immediate hit with car enthusiasts. With it's more aerodynamic shape, more horsepower, radically redesigned front and rear suspensions, the <i>993</i> was almost like no <b>911</b> before it. 

The 1998 version of the venerable <b>911</b> is undoubtedly the finest example of the marque to ever come out of Zuffenhausen. With gobs of horsepower, insanely powerful brakes, a roomy and quiet interior and all the goodies most luxury car buyers are looking for as standard features, the 1998 <b>911</b> stands out as Porsche's ability to finally work out all those nagging bugs from the <b>911</b> platform.

Gone are the days of massive oversteer, with the new rear suspension taming the forces of nature on hard turns. Power comes from a smooth running 3.6 liter flat six boxer motor, pumping out a robust 394 horsepower through a simple intake management system called the varioram system. Not only is this <b>911</b> more powerful that earlier models, it actually runs cleaner and gets better mileage because of it's more aerodynamic shape that previous models. 

With its bulging rear fender and sloping headlights that slide lovingly into the front fenders, the <b>911</b> slips into the wind like no other car on the road, save of course for multimillion dollar Le Mans cars designed to do even better than most road cars anyway. (But wait! didn't Porsche win Le Mans with a GT-1 model based on the <i>993</i>? Yes, true believer they did. And did they win Le Mans with at GT-1 model based on the <i>996</i>? No, sir, they didn't. Makes you kind of wonder which was the better platform, doesn't it.)

Now let's get down to the brass tacks. <b>Porsches</b> are not now, nor have ever been cheap to buy. A certain exclusivity of the number built and imported have assured that <b>Porsche's</b> will continue to fetch a pretty penny for the privilege of ownership, and the 993 is no exception. Starting at around $60K or so for a coupe, all the way up to $140K for a turbo version (but what a car !!), these cars aren't for everyone. Luckily for all of us, all cars lose value and the 993 is no exception. Prices for 1995 models are running around $35-40K depending on mileage with the 1998 models in the $50-60K range. But, if you are fortunate enough to be able to fork over the dough for a 1998 <i>993</i>, you'll save yourself gobs in maintenance and repair costs. This is not a <i>Ferrari</i>, there are actually people who can work on them and parts are readily available. 

Unlike previous <b>911's</b>, <i>993</i> have hydraulic valves that never, I repeat, never need adjusting. Synthetic oil is installed from the factory and can, at least in <b>Porsche's</b> mind, go 15,000 miles between changes (but I wouldn't recommend it). Scheduled services consist of changing the engine oil and both filters, replacement of the air filter, cabin pollen filters and topping off the fluid levels. That's it. Nothing else needs to be done. Major services get spark plugs and nothing more. But be warned, the price for 30,000 and 60,000 mile services run considerably higher because of the placement of the #6 spark plug. It's almost impossible to replace with the engine in the car (master race, my ass!). Other than your typical &quot;it's a 911 and it's gonna leak oil&quot; condition, this car is about as trouble free as anything that comes off the assembly lines from <i>Toyota</i> or <i>Honda</i>. Just fill it with gas, check the oil level occasionally, and drive the hell out of it. 

So, let's summarize. 30-plus years of building the same car. 30-plus years to finally work out all the kinks. Only to build the car for four stinking years and replace it with a car that has a water cooled engine, that looks just like a Boxster from the front, that sometimes has a tendency to throw rods through engine cases (but that's a story for another time), that sometimes likes to mix coolant with oil and vice versa so that the coolant in the reservoir looks more like a chocolate shake from Bob's Big Boy than coolant......I don't want to belabor the new car, but you get the point. Why did they stop making the finest example of the <b>911</b> ever? Was it peer pressure? Was it some firm who made <b>Porsche</b> an offer they couldn't refuse? Was it blackmail? The world may never know. But after reading this, you'll know the real story on which <b>911</b> to buy and if you can swing it buy the <i>993 C4S</i> with wide turbo fenders, turbo wheels, all wheel drive and every accessory you need and want to make your driving experience one worth taking on a daily basis. If you can't swing the high zoot model, a regular <i>993</i> will fill the bill quite nicely, thank you. For if you own this car, drive it every day, every where and in every type of weather, because leaving it in the garage while you take the family runabout to work is an absolute crime. <br><br>
