            Man, do I miss that car...but then again, it was a maintenance nightmare!

I had the 92 Golf GTI 16V for 2 years before a lady hit the right front and totalled it.  :(  

Before the accident, my GTI had been given a new transmission, four new wheel bearings, a clutch control cable, power steering pump, etc...etc...etc.  While in the dealer's repairshop, I heard a guy complaining that he'd bought the extended warranty and never used it on his golf!  Man, VW really lost some money on mine!  

Since then, I haven't found a car that fits quite as nicely.  I'd get in the car on a rainy monday morning and actually enjoy the drive to work.  It handled like it was on rails, yet on long trips, those recaro seats just seemed to fit like a glove.  Never had that achey back, painful unfolding feeling after a long trip in this car!  Yes, I miss it, despite the occasional headaches!
