            Hey there, fellow racing enthusiasts. What's up? Today was a sad day in Hazaido Prefecture. Cousin Ruke and I were heading to Tokyo for the domestic only auto show.

About 20 miles from the city the ground started shaking! The godzilla light on the instrument panel lit up and we slowed down to better avoid any debris that might come flying down the road. Remember, our car is a 95 Civic EX with NSX motor swap and six turbos. It used to be four turbos, but seeing as how we had two cylindars not doing anything we added two more. If anything happens we can get out of the way!

The noise got louder..like a bunch of fighter jets. The godzille light turned off and the kamikaze vengence light came on! That's when we saw them, a bunch of imports coming up on us FAST. We're surrounded on all sides. They're Mustangs and Camaros!

&quot;Ruke-san,&quot; I exclaimed to Cousin Ruke. &quot;They'll never keep up with the General Ree. Imports are all slow as heck, show em what a real domestic can do.&quot;

Ruke nailed the gas, and we started to fade on those fools. Suddenly the grumbling of their motors was too much to bear. We couldn't hear the soothing &quot;tweeeeeetttt&quot; of our motor anymore, just their loud booming gargling sound. They were right up on us, surrounding us on all sides. There was no where to go.

A black Mustang hit us from the side. His car is heavy! Stupid low tech imports. He hit us hard and sent us towards the side, but Ruke recovered. He slammed it into 2nd at 65 kph and put the pedal to the metal! Unfortunately, even with our NSX motor running six turbos and over 700 left wheel bariki, a Civic is still a Civic. The pinnacle of Japanese sports car design just couldn't handle it. The car twisted in around itself, unable to handle the two or three hundred inch-pounds of torque we were making.

The Camaro driver noticed the General Ree starting to lose control and slammed into it. We went flying into the Mustang owner, sparks everywhere as we rolled along against the side of his car. The Mustang driver opened his door real quick and sent us flying back across the roadway, into a ditch.

Suddenly I'm having hot steamy sex with sexy American &quot;bitches!&quot; Yeah it was great, musta been like three or four of them there. They were all laying before me naked..the light shining off their steamy glistening bodies. Calling for me...&quot;Bou...bou...come take us Bou...&quot;

&quot;Rippa ne...&quot; I whispered...as their long slender legs slowly opened before me. Then all of a sudden they went into labor, splitting open like a dropped honeydew and 2 Camaros, a Mustang, and a Firebird drove out!!! 

I woke up screaming. Blood trickling down the side of my head. Ruke next to me, head against the wheel. More like the wheel against his head, we were upside down!

&quot;Ruke, Ruke!!!&quot; I shouted. No answer! I managed to kick the passanger side window out and crawl outside. My side of the General Ree was ok, but Ruke's was pretty smashed in. I knew I would need help to get Ruke out of the car.

I used ancient Japanese art of &quot;sonna onna wameki,&quot; or, &quot;screaming like a woman.&quot; Help soon came, in the form of Keizan! &quot;Ooo, what were you Dukata danshi doing??&quot; I tried to explain to him what was going on, as he used the Jaws of Inochi to get Ruke out of the car.

Of course, Keizan didn't believe us and assumed we were driving wrecklessly. We received the ticket for driving dangerously and the General Ree was assumed totalled. I was able to salvage two of the turbos but that's about the only part over the hood that wasn't melted. What's worse, Ruke is seriously hurt and in the hospital.

I knew that something rotton is going on in Hazaido Prefecture. Who were those guys and who hired them? And what's more, what do they want with me and Ruke? I needed to get home to Uncle Jeshi. Together we can figure this out. Poor Ruke..I hope he'll be ok. And how can I stop these people? The General Ree is on its way to the scrap yard.

I just got back to the farm, and I'm here now. Uncle Jeshi should be home soon from the store and we can work all this out. Hopefully I'll have some better news in the next few days.
