            We bought our 1998 Tahoe new.
When shopping for a new vehicle we test drove the Tahoe. That is all it took to convince us it was the SUV we wanted. 
The love affair with this Tahoe has not ended. We love the ride it gives. The dependability it provides, and of course the great appearance. The only downside is the gas milage, although it isn't as bad as other SUV's of comparatable size, especially on a trip.
The visability is awsome and a breeze to drive. 
I would highly recommend a Tahoe for anyone who commands the very best.
By the way, except for the oil change every 3,000 miles it has NEVER been back for any service problem. Now thats dependability, and we are very fussy people :)
Oh yes, living in the North East we love those heated seats in the winter and the Rear Air~Conditioner in the summer.<br><br>
