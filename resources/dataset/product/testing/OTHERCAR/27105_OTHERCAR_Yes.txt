            Well, I am one of those people who actually owned both a first and a second generation MR2s during my life time.  
Both generations of MR2 are a total blast to drive and are relatively easy to maintain.  The only complain about my 
first generation MR2 was that it had cramped interior when seating two people, my arm and a passenger's arm tend 
to hit each other while driving.  I sold my 1985 MR2 and bought a brand new 1992 Civic Si due to a need for space 
or else I would have stay with it until it would die.  Also, rust was a bit of a problem with my 85 MR2 because it 
came from Alaska when I bought it as a used in 1990, so make sure that rust buildup is minimal when purchasing 
one.

My current MR2 is a 92 none turbo which I purchased 3 years ago from a used car lot in 1997.  I sold my Civic Si 
due to thefts associated with Civics.  My civic got stripped twice and I couldn't park it on the streets while visiting 
friends without having a nightmare about it.  So, I went back to my old fancy but this time I bought a second 
generation.  I got it at 52,000 miles and until now it clocked at 92,000 with three minor repairs; radiator leak, 
brakes, and a new clutch.  My car is as lively as ever at this moment, well seasoned and all.  I equipped the car with 
Greddy exhaust, RSR sport springs, and a set of 16 inches rims and tires awhile back after I purchased a car.  
Unfortunately one day during a leisure drive to lunch, the rear rim cracked due to one tight turn at a corner 
smashed my rear rim to a pavement but no damage to the suspension or brake rotor.  Now Mister2 is back to the 
original factory rims, the grip is much different with low profile tires and rims and I would recommend it to 
everyone who want more adrenaline cornering out of their cars.  One of the press wrote that the steering on 
1991-1992 cars lacked response in the middle - well, upgrading wheels and tires to lower profile setting will fix 
just that (thinner tires in front/thicker tires on the back).  

The engine on this car (5S-FE) is the same engine which powered the previous generation Celica and Camry LE 
which is to say, trouble less.  If you take care of it (regular oil change and maintenance ), it should be as reliable 
as an average Camry.  This isn't to say that it feels like a Camry or a Celica, the mid-engine location of the engine 
and the lightweight made it a unique vehicle to toss around all day long.  The first generations are lighter and more peppy but if you want more power, torque and comfortable ride buy a second generation.  The torque response on this car is 
satisfactory and the horsepower isn't as bad as I thought it would be from a 130 horsepower car - the torque 
buildup make it more fun driving around town and you would forget about the lack of horsepower anyway.  Anyone 
who wants more speed could always get the turbo.  

Both first and second generation MR2s are one of the best used Japanese sports cars you could purchase and live 
with for a long long time.  Buy it while there are still good one around. <br><br>
