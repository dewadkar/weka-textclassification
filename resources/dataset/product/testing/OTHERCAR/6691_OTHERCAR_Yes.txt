              When i first saw this vehicle i fell in love with its unique look. I saw it driving on the road and i said to myself, I need that car. I went to the dealer ship and they told me about the side impact and whip lash protection systems which made me feel that this is a safe car. This car comes standard with stability and traction control. It also comes with automatic climate control, AM/FM radio, and a three disc CD changer. 

  Since my purchase of the Volvo C70 i have had no problems with it and I have had no unexpected visits to the shop. I have owned this car for a little under a year and i am looking forward to owning it for the rest of my life. This car handles like a dream and the shifts of the gear are so smooth it feels like butter. Before you look at any other car i recommend that you first give the Volvo C70 a test drive. <br><br>
