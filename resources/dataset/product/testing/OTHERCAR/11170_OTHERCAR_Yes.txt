            I love my RAV4.  There are lots of places to read about why the RAV4 is so wonderful, and they're all true.  Check out Consumer Reports auto buying guide for 2001 or Edmunds.com to name just a couple popular, trustworthy sources.

Actually buying a RAV4 is very difficult.  You'll find many such comments on the Edmunds.com Townhall discussion boards.  The problem is three-fold--absence of standard trim levels or packages for the RAV4, Toyota's misleading brochures and online information and low RAV4 inventory at dealerships.

First, there are four base-model RAV4s--2WD automatic, 2WD manual, 4WD automatic and 4WD manual.  Those models don't even include air conditioning, power locks/windows or any simple option.  Everything is optional.  In and of itself, this is not such a bad thing since in theory, you only pay for the options you want.  

Second, Toyota's brochures and Toyota.com will help you configure the RAV4 of your dreams.  That's where the dream ends.  Don't expect to find what Toyota literature helps you configure acutally on a lot anywhere.  Even the "standard packages" shown at Toyota.com don't really exist.  They're all for marketing.  In reality, you cannot even order a RAV4 (or any Toyota) with just the options you want.  If it's not sitting on the lot or if the dealership can't trade another dealership for it, you can't have it.  There is no such thing as ordering from Toyota.  If you don't believe me, be sure to get your Toyota dealer to explain to you precisely what he means by "order" if he brings that up--and be sure to visit discussion sites where you'll find people waiting months on an "order".

Third, RAV4s are in short supply.  The ones that are on the lots are generally over-outfitted.  That might make it easier for someone who wants every option available, but if you don't want every option available, you're going to have to pay extra for options you don't want in order to get what you want--the antithesis of the "in theory" support for the "everything is optional" method mentioned earlier.

Given these three factors, other problems arise.  It's difficult to compare RAV4s to its competitors since you really have to look at each RAV4 thats available on lots near you and compare them individually against the cost and trim levels of other manufacturer's vehicles.  It's not like you can say, Toyota LE is like Honda EX, and the cost difference is X.  You have to do it over and over for each RAV4 you're considering.  Furthermore, if you do decide upon RAV4, you have to do the same thing among RAV4s themselves--comparing and pricing.  It's a real pain.  

FYI--I insisted on copies of window stickers to take home and make spreadsheets from, which I populated with information from Edmunds.com, combined with the financing arrangements I had.  I happen to be an information systems manager for a bank, and I have a degree in accounting, and this was a challenge for me.  I wondered several times how someone without as much spreadsheet familiarity and financial savvy would manage.

The bottom line is that while the RAV4 is a great vehicle, you'll be so irritated at Toyota by the time its over that you'll be looking for an alternative.  I did, and I loved the Honda CR-V, which was even roomier and much easier to buy.  In the end, I didn't want the CR-V because the 2002 body style--which will show up this fall--will be all new.  I didn't want to buy an almost out-of-date body style, and I couldn't find a way to wait until fall for the new CR-V since my old car was a lease (Honda, btw).  Believe me, I tried.
