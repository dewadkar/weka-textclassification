            I was in the market for a better commuter than my '98 Jeep Cherokee.  Some might argue that this isn't exactly searching for the Holy Grail, but nonetheless, I'm picky and 6'4".
<p>
I test drove the BMW 330i, BMW 530i, and Audi S4.  They were all great cars.  However, I just couldn't find a comfortable driving position in any of them.  No matter how much I squirmed around, the wheel was always right in view of the speedo & tach, or my legs were too damn long and had to rest against a door or console, or I couldn't seem to get low enough.  Then, on a whim, I stopped by a Saab dealer and test drove a Viggen.
<p>
What a rush.  Perfect driving position.  Ultra comfortable.  Terrific power in any gear.  It was a perfect fit.
<p>
The Viggen has torque steer, being a FWD with 230HP.  It is a driver's car.  Pay attention.  Hold on to the wheel.  Be responsible with the throttle.  These seem like fundamentals, yet Viggens are criticized over and over for making them requirements.  Put your cell phone down, take your eyes off the guy picking his nose in the lane next to you, and drive.  That's what the Viggen is all about.
