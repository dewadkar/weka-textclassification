            We purchased our Toyota Highlander back in May, 2001.  Before visiting the Toyota lot, we did not know anything about the Highlander.  In fact, we were informed the car was just released in March 2001 and marketing had not yet started!We are truly excited to say we own such a new, quality, luxury car from a highly respected company such as Toyota.  I have always stood behind Toyota and been a loyal customer.

The thing I love about the Toyota Highlander is it has the appeal of a luxury automobile with the sensible "necessities" of SUV.  The interior is very appealing with faux wood finish on the dashboard, classic fabrics/carpets and lots of head and leg room.  I really like that the driver and front passenger have pull-down arm rests to invite a comfortable driving environment.  There are "mini" stereo speakers distributed discreetly throughout with great sound from a decent "Toyota-model" stereo/cd system.  

The back storage hatch is good size with a cargo net to store groceries, etc. and a roll top cover to hide all of your belongings in the back.  The back storage also holds a standard size spare tire, tools and has extra hidden compartments to store your extra safety travel equipment.

The exterior of the Toyota Highlanders looks very similar to the Lexus SUV.  I'm sure it makes the Lexus SUV owners a little angry to know there is another SUV on the road that looks exactly like the Lexus and costs half the price!  It has the roundness shape like a Mini-Van, but the general body looks similar to a Jeep Cherokee.  It has a sporty top rack on the roof and a good looking spoiler over the rear window.  The car has front and back windshield wipers, cruise control, sunroof, moonroof and much more!

I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a fun, sporty, reliable SUV.  The gas mileage is decent (approx. 23mpg) and holds a 17 gallon tank.  The Toyota Highlander is a terrific car for the sporty bachelor, traveler, adventurer or the young family needing an affordable, reliable, and fun car!
