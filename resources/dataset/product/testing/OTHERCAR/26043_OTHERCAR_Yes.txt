            The Montero is one of only a few SUVs I'd ever own.  Let me explain some of the reasons why.

<b>Safety</b> 
In this day of the ridiculously-sized Ford Excursion and Expedition, driving a small vehicle becomes more and more dangerous as it becomes smaller relative to others out there.  

Since survival in a serious accident depends in a large part on whose car is biggest--and Americans are more and more buying these monstrosities in the forms of SUVs and trucks--a concerned driver should be considering whether the VW Bug is really what he wants to be riding in should he collide with an Excursion.

I should note that I'm not usually keen on large vehicles.  My last vehicle was a Honda Civic, which must weigh about 1,500 pounds;  my previous was a still-smaller Toyota Corolla.  But with kids, the whole game changes, and 'size matters' becomes more of a mantra, especially when you maneuver over icy winter roads.

The Montero weighs in at around 4,250 pounds (curb weight).  That's big.  The Expedition, which appears sizably larger, only has 600 pound over this Montero.  The Excursion hits the scale at 6,600 pounds, well over both. 

Related to similar vehicles in its class, the Montero does 'weigh in' well: around 400 pounds over the Nissan Pathfinder; a full 1,000 pounds over the Honda CR-V; 500 over the Jeep Grand Cherokee; 300-500 over the Honda Passport; 300-600 over the Nissan Xterra; 600-800 over the Toyota 4Runner.  The only heavier comparable SUV is the LandRover Discovery (300+), and I do not trust these vehicles one bit, based on family experience.

My '95 has passenger and driver airbags, which I've never had the misfortune of needing.  Nonetheless, we're talking safety here, and this is part of it.

<b>Design</b>
The Montero holds its design.  This '95 edition stands well against even the most recent SUVs, as it was in many ways a breakthough design for Mitsubishi.  The 2001 Montero (not the sport edition) in my opinion is gaudy and bulky looking;  I much prefer the '95 design with a more refined look and less exaggerated curves.

The vehicle size is perfect.  The wheelbase is neither too long nor too short.  I can parallel park it downtown very easily and not worry about the width or girth of the vehicle.  Inside, space is roomy and comfortable.  Head room is exceptional.  In fact, after riding in a Mercedes SUV, I was thrilled with the headroom in the Montero.  The same goes for the Toyota 4Runner--tight head space.

I've come to love the sense of command you get sitting in the front.  The controls are relatively low-cut, and the hood slopes downward;  combine this with the firm, perched seats and you get a great range of sight in front of you.  

This vehicle comes with a fold-out pair of seats in the back, giving it seating for seven--perfect for kids. Really, the best you can do is five adults and two children in the back, since those two seats are pretty tight and tough to get to.  I've ridden in the back with little discomfort, but wouldn't ask my mother to do the same.  

Access to that third row is via the fold-up second row, which is tricky.  A better design might be a 60/40 split seat.  The real issue here is that if you have children's seats in the second row, you're forced to move them to get access to the back.  You can optionally leap in from the back via the wide-opening door, but if both seats are down, you're forced to jump over them.  

Those fold out seats <i>do</i> take up considerable storage space in the back.  When folded up, I can barely fit an adult bicycle in the back because of them.  I'm told you can remove them, which you might consider if you don't have children or just need it for daily commuting.

By and large, though, I've been very pleased with these additional seats, since I have three nieces and nephews that periodically ride with my family of four.

<b>Comfort</b>
This is where Mitsubishi scores a slam dunk.  <b>The front seats are the most comfortable I've ever used, period.</b>  That's saying a lot.  But with the back problems I have, it's an important factor.  I can ride four hours in this Montero without back discomfort, most other vehicles begin to cause pain well within one hour.

These seats have superb lumbar support in a firm fabric seat.  There are no adjustments other than forward and back and recline, but you don't need them.  A great addition are the adjustable armrests on the inside of each of the front seats.  I drive leaning on my right elbow a bit, which is really quite a thrilling position--my left hand is free to place out the window or drink a coffe. Kudos to Mitsubishi in this category, I love it.

The middle row is nothing to complain about, either.  The support is excellent.  Like the front seats, these have adjustable headrests (up/down and forward/back) and retractable exterior armrests with cupholders.  My kids love these, because they can sit in their carseats and nurse a drink next to them while riding.

<b>Power</b>
This is the weakest point about this car.  The V6 engine sports only 177 horsepower in a 3.0 liter engine, which is rather weak.  The better SR model has 214 horsepower in a 3.5 liter engine, which is better.  What Mitsubishi should do is offer a V8 model for those of us who really want more power.

This is not to say I'm unhappy with the power.  It is adequate for day-to-day operation, but being in Alaska, sometimes we want a little more to clear a hill or carry a load.

<b>Ride</b>
Firm, quiet and rigid.  I tell my wife this is a truck, but she doesn't like to hear that.  The suspension is firm and can handle some pretty nasty conditions.  Really, folks, these SUVs are trucks modified for passenger use (except for a few, like the pathetic RAV4 or the respected CR-V).  

The engine does eminate some noise into the vehicle, but it's hardly noticeable and very little compared to other vehicles in its class.

<b>Repairs</b>
Use your Mitsubishi dealer exclusively.  You'll pay extra, but these cars need premium parts.  For example, if you don't put in factory brake pads, you'll regret it when you drive by the school to pick up your children because it will squeal like nothing you've heard.  

This is a bit of a bummer, because I loved the cheap repairs on all my Toyotas.  I could take them anyway to get fixed.  Not so with these Monteros.  Don't trust anyone but the Mitsubishi people with these.  You'll pay more, but it's worth it.

<b>Fuel Efficiency</b>
I get around 17 mpg, which is rather lower, but comparable to other SUVs in this class.  Mitsubishi claims a 14/18 city/highway split, which is consistent with my experience.  

I see the newer engines have improved in both fuel efficiency (16/19) and power (200 hp), which is great. 

Nonetheless, if a car performs well without problem, you don't complain too much about fuel efficiency.

<b>Conclusion</b>
This is a great family SUV.  I've found few others that have the combination of seating, safety, dependability, and pride of ownership that this vehicle offers.  

Pack in the kids, pop in a good cd, buy a cup of coffee and go for a long, painless ride in a vehicle you can be proud of.
