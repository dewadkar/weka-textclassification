              I'll try to be objective in my review of the Cougar, but I admit it will be difficult. You see, I just purchased my 2000 black, fully-loaded V6 on March 23rd of this year and we are probably still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase of our relationship. I'm happy to say, I've had only a minor problem with my Cougar and that is....the stereo. For instance, I'll be driving along with my favorite tunes blaring and all of a sudden the volume will mysteriously decrease! It's slight, but noticeable and annoying. I find myself constantly adjusting the volume. Another little nuisance that I've come across, is the fact that there are practically no exterior, after-market accessories available for the new body style Cougar. Very disheartening when you're trying to customize.
  Well, I don't want to bad-mouth my new &quot;baby&quot; too much, so instead let's turn to what I LOVE about my Cougar. That is, the whole exterior. This car is too sleek and sexy for the road! Especially in black. When I park, I turn around and look at it and it's there, always &quot;smiling&quot; back at me. 
  This car handles beautifully and is fairly quick, considering the fact that my previous car was a '96 Chevy Cavalier and the pick-up in that was lacking to say the least. I've gotten my Cougar up to about 110 mph on the highway and all I can say is, the faster you drive this car, the more FUN it is!! 
  I don't want to offend anyone reading this opinion by any means, but I must say, this car is NOT for people above the age of 40. I believe, those that should invest in the Cougar are those aged 21-35, because this age group will get the maximum driving excitement out of it. 
  The age issue aside, I'll end by saying that anyone &quot;looking for a good time&quot; should call their local Lincoln-Mercury dealer and ask to test drive a Cougar today!  (Sorry if that sounded like a commercial!) <br><br>
