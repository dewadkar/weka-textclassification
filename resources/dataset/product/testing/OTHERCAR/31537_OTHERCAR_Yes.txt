            The first thing you'll notice about the Fuji MX-1700 is
it's size--its' not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes!
But don't let the small size fool you.  This mid-priced
model takes pictures whose quality rival those of larger,
clunkier (and more expensive) 2-megapixel cameras.

This camera has many features to admire, such as a true
3X optical zoom (as well as a 2X digital zoom).  The
controls are well laid-out, and convenient to use. Special
features such as flash settings (such as red-eye and delay)
and macro have their own buttons, making them much easier
to use than similar features on cameras that make you
scroll through endless menus when you want to change the
settings.

The lithium-ion batteries that this camera uses are both
a blessing and curse.  On the one hand, these batteries
charge right in the camera (with the included charger 
cord), and are much smaller than 4-AA batteries, which
helps keep the camera portable.  On the other hand,
their small size gives them a bit let juice, which means
that you should probably keep a spare charged up for
emergency swaps.

If this camera has any drawback, it would be its uneven
low-light performance.  I've seen some other digital
cameras (like some of the Olympus models) that provide
more consistent results when indoors under low-light
conditions.  With the MX-1700, you won't always get top
quality pictures indoors (though in most cases, they are
at least satisfactory).

Of course, staying at home shooting pictures isn't the
point of this camera.  If you're looking for a great
digital camera that you can just slip into your pocket
when you are on the go, that combines moderate price
with great 2 megapixel performance, you won't find a
better choice than the Fuji MX-1700.<br><br>
