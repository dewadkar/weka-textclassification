            We bought this mainly as a utility vehicle for our business. It has plenty of room for all the necessary tools and gear for our phone company.My husband mainly drives it and needs a comfortable car as he drives a lot of miles daily. I love driving this vehicle. You are up high and feel really safe. I have heard that Suburbans have a excellent safety record. It is a lot of truck! People don't tend to &quot;mess&quot; with you and give you plenty of space on the road. It's a good vehicle for hauling &quot;teams&quot;. It is BIG and you can't &quot;zip&quot; right into the little bitty parking spaces, so you may have to park and walk....I love to drive the Suburban, it handles like a much smaller car. It does drink gas, unfortunately! I think it's an excellent vehicle, if you have a large family or need the extra hauling capacity. ALL your friends remember you have a big old 'burban, when they have to move something! If you're worried about gas mileage.....THIS AIN'T THE SUV for you! I think handicapped people might have some problems here, as it is a long way up and down. If you are a large or tall person, there is plenty of room here.<br><br>
