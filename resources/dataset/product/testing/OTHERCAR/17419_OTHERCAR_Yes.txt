            I have been driving a Toyota 4Runner for a few months now, and I could not be happier!  The truck has been very reliable.  I own a 6 cylinder, 4 wheel drive truck.  I have been off road several times, and have had little or no problem each time.  Furthermore, the truck rides like a car when I am on the road.  It handles with great care, just like a car, the only exception is that you are a little high up on the road.  Which can be a wonderful saftey feature.  Also, I love the extra features in this truck!  With the back window going all the way down, the 4Runner is a very comfortable ride.  The cruise control is easy to use, and the AC in the car is awsome.  Factory speakers will do just fine.  They have a large capability if you know how to tune your speakers.  
The only cons to the car are the drink holders, stability at high speeds, and they can be a bit top heavy.  The drink holders are not very good.  They are directly above the radio and the AC control.  The car is not very stable at high speed, because it is so high off the ground, but someone who drives fast should be driving a sports car.  Overall, this car is a great car!  <br><br>
