            I am now driving a 1994 Chrysler Town and Country Mini-Van...loaded.  This decision was not by choice, believe me.  I have no kids and have harbored disdain for these bulky, hard to see past vehicles in the past.  My wife came down with a rare bone condition that resulted in multiple broken hips and legs.  Getting in and out of our Grand Marquis GS was torture for her so I had to come up with a solution.

As luck would have it a practically new, only 22,000 miles, Chrysler T&amp;C became available.  This van was retrofitted with a special ,rather  unique, front passenger swiveling seat.  This seat base is made by Braun and rotates out 90 degrees and then extends out of the vehicle and down toward the ground.  This allows the wheelchair person to easily transfer from the wheel chair to the electric seat and then be pulled back into the vehicle.  Enough about the seat, this is about the van.  

Having been used to driving a full size American V8 I was sure that I would not like this mini-van and made up my mine to hate it.  After several months I have to say that I was dead wrong.  This van has the big six and actually is faster that the Grand Marquis, i.e., better acceleration.  It is just as quiet on the road, gets better mileage, has a lot more room in it , a plethora of cup holders, storage compartments, and .is more comfortable than the Mercury.  I can now see why they have been so popular.

This T&amp;C has four leather captain's chairs, with armrests, an outstanding Infinity sound system, and a third seat in the rear.  Not having, kids I seldom need the rear seat, so I keep it folded down and pushed forward, allowing me a tremendous amount of space for stuff.  I have driven the new Chrysler Town and Country and they are ever bit as good as the '94.  I did go to http://www.crashtest.com and find that the latest body style is not as safe as the '94, '95 iteration.  

If you like luxury transportation and want to have plenty of room, I recommend that you look into a Chrysler T&amp;C, used or new, it is a nice ride.
