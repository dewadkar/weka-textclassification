            We bought a 1991 Dodge Dakota for my husbands work truck a few years ago.  We have the basic model. No much on frills but it's a real work animal.  Four years ago when our youngest was only a couple of months old my husband was t-boned by a guy who ran a red light at 45+ miles.  The police said he was really lucky to have walked away but we credit the stability of this truck for his safety.  The truck itself sustained over 8,000 in damage and our insurance company choose to fix it rather than total it.  He's still driving it and knock on wood it has only required regular maintenance and a few minor repairs.  <br><br>
