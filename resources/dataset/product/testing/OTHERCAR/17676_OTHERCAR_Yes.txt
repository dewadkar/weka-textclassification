            Several months after finding out we were going to have a baby, my husband and I realized that it was time to start looking at four door cars. We both drove small, two-door hatchbacks and pictured the difficulties we would have getting a baby in and out of the back seat of either one of these cars.

We test drove the Saturn SL1 first, then went to a Pontiac Sunfire, Toyota Echo, Hyundai Accent, and a Ford Focus, but ended up coming back to the Saturn because:
          1. It was a comfortable, quiet, fairly smooth ride.
          2. It had all the features we wanted.
          3. There was absolutely no price haggling.
          4. Saturn has a great reputation.
          5. The lease payments fit within our budget.
          6. Safety, Safety, Safety...

I did a lot of safety research on the Saturn and found that it scored very high on Consumer Reports, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and several other vehicle crash test facilities. On the Insurance Institute, the only cars that proved to be safer in Saturn's class were double the price with only marginal safety increases. We were convinced after seeing those results.

This is what Saturn service is like:

We picked up the car on a Monday afternoon, and by Monday night had to have the car towed back into the dealership because the security system was not recognizing our keys. (With computers and electronics, you have to be prepared for anything) It was in the shop the rest of the following day. The salesman called in the afternoon and said not to worry about arranging to get to the dealership because he was bringing the car back to me. He showed up  a half hour later with a sincere apology and two movie tickets for our inconvenience. When I got in the car, there were candies left in the console unit. Its the little things that truly stand out.
