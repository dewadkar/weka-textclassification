            I decided I needed a digital camera when my business went e-commerce. Photographer's fees were phenomenal, so I started shopping for a digital camera that a novice could pick up and make great close up pictures with--boy did I find it! The FD83 is everything a camera should be. It's simple to use,has the option of still pics and movies, and that wonderful floppy disk that makes your pics quick and easy to view without all the additional equipment. The battery is a big plus too, it's rechargeable and it will hold it's charge through several sessions or events without changing-and the camera will turn itself off to save the battery if you forget to do it. Another great aspect is the camera's memory will allow you to remove your disk and copy to several other blank disks to give instant copies to friends!(Good for family reunions and other special occasions) I've only found one slight drawback to this camera since I've had it and that would be the placement of the flash tends to cause red eye syndrome. For action and nature stills(you can get as close as 3-4&quot; with the macro lense) you can't beat it. I would recommend this camera to novice and professional alike.It's the best money I've spent in a while.<br><br>
