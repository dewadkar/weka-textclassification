            Last August, my girlfriend and I rented a 1999 Mazda Protege SE to go to Sudbury which was 7 hours away. I immediately fell in love with it, when I saw it. 
We were supposed to rent a Toyota Echo, but it wasn't available that day, so they let us use the Protege at the same cost as the Toyota. When I got in the driverï¿½s seat, I got used to the instruments and controls right away, as they were all simple and in the best locations. The CD player was pretty good, as you could crank it high enough to feel the bass without destroying the speakers. The downside was that there was no center armrest. Not very comfortable without one for a long trip, although the seats was comfortable. 
Everything was tight. The steering, the brakes, and the transmission, all worked very excellent. The only drawback is its not too powerful 4 cylinder which produces around 105 hp, but to make up for that lack of acceleration, I found it could reach high speeds without the whole car shaking or rattling. It went rather smooth. The gas mileage was pretty good. Only spent $70 for a 1200 km drive. Not bad, comparing to the Dodge V10! 
The trunk space was a bit small to my liking, but still sufficient enough. Although it is better with the backseat folded down. The back seat was pretty average. 
Now to the styling. I liked this style of the 1999 Protege better than the previous styles. The Protege looks better than the new Honda Civic sedan. Drive, buy, or rent one, and you'll fall in love...
