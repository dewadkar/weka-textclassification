            This was my first digital camera that I owned and I only used it for less than a year before I opted to get a better camera. I actually found the model as a closeout at a local electronic superstore.

My main beef with the camera is the pictures provided were passable at quarter size relative to your 8x10 print, however, blowing up the pictures in a photo editor and the dreaded sandstorm effect seen in low pixel digital cameras was apparent. Also, this camera didn't include a flash so indoor pictures were usually out of the question. I managed to get around the fixed lens problem by using an attachment system provided by tiffen(consisted of a plastic lens holder than went over the camera lens and allowed you to attach a wide angle and telephoto lens). The trouble with this is that the attachment prevented you from moving the camera lens at different angles which is the only strongpoint i consider with this model. 

My suggestion is that with the current crop of digital cameras out on the market I wouldn't give this camera a second thought unless you got it for free.<br><br>
