            The saying is true when is comes to this car. You get what you pay for. I bought a <b>Plymouth Neon</b> cause I had to get something fast that was in my price range at the time. I didn't have a very large down payment and I didn't want to have my car payments coming out more each month then my rent, I looked into many smaller cars. The <b>Plymouth Neon</b> seemed to be the one that would fit in my price range and looked pretty sporty, not like a family car.

The ride in this car is not a very smooth one though. You feel everything in the road as you are driving. As well as when the wind picks up, you can feel it pushing the car. Not as bad as in some I have driven though like the Kia. You also sit very low to the ground. I at one time had a 85 Mustang and the Neon seems to sit even lower then the Mustang did.

While driving this car you will also notice that there is a lot of noise coming from all around the car. You can hear air leaking into the car, the faster you drive the more air you hear. I feel that this is due to the fact that there is no metal going around the door windows on this car, only rubber that the glass is to close into. When it rains though or I wash my car, three of my windows leak water. Not enough to leave a puddle but enough to wet the inside of the window as well as going down the door. Not only can you hear air while driving, every move this cars makes you hear it. The steering wheel and front dash sound like they move when you hit a bump or something. When you turn it also makes little noises within the dash.

There are a few other problems with the car that I started getting right after I had the car just over a month. The first thing I had to have fixed was the back light sockets. Which I can understand sockets going out in ones car but the reason that I was told that they went out was due to the fact that the trunk was leaking water and caused it to burn out. The light didn't burn out, just the socket its self.

Shortly after that the driver side window started rubbing some where inside the door, leaving scratches along the glass, as well as the brakes on the car would not hold. I went to stop at a light one day and just about went through it cause they just wouldn't grip to stop the car. I did take it in to get repaired and I was informed that none of the issues would be able to be covered in the warranty they gave me so I had to pay for all that my self. Which later on I found out that all they did was &quot;clean&quot; my brakes off and not replace them. Which I have had to go back and have them fixed again. 

With in a few days of getting my car back, remind you this is now about the 4th month I had had it, the radio decided that I didn't need my front speakers to listen to music any more. So they just stopped working. When I took that in, they told me that that also was not covered in the warranty and that I would have to pay for it to be fixed and I about fell out on the floor when they told me how much it would cost to fix a &quot;wire that had a short&quot; in it. I just had a friend fix it and it turned out it was a bit more then &quot;just a short&quot;. When he pulled the radio out, the wires were a little wet. So I believe that they got wet and burned out just like a lot of other things have in the car.

The last problem I have had with the car was the air went out in it around the 6th month I had it. This was just after summer, so the weather had cooled off a bit but not much. And if any of you have been to Texas or live in Texas, you know that you need air in your car. Its not a fun thing driving to work at 3pm in the heat of the day. By the time I would get to work I would need to take a new shower.

The &quot;get up and go&quot; in this car is not all that bad. Its not as quick as the 85 Mustang but it sure is better then the Kia Sportage. I have even had a 92 Chevy S10 that had more get up then this car. It does on the other hand get great gas mileage. Not as good as the Kia. Which I could put $18 and it would take me a little over 260. The mustang eat gas like it was going out of style and the S10 pickup would take $12 and get just under 200 miles. I feel this car up with $13 at the most and go a little over 220 miles on that tank.

It handles turns pretty good. You don't have to slow way down like you do in the Kia. Then again in the Kia you feel like the car is going to flip over if you go to fast but it doesn't/hasn't. The steering wheel though on the <b>Plymouth Neon</b> is very loose. It has a lot of play in it and to me that makes me feel like I have less control over what the car is going to do. This car also has some very bad blind spots on both sides. I had to get use to it and quick cause in the first month I almost hit to people cause I could not see them at the tail end of the car. That's not good when you want to get over in the other lane. Unlike the Kia, you can see all around you and the blind spots are not that blinding.

Over all, I feel that this car would be a good car for someone that just needs a second car for maybe the kids to drive once in a while but even then I am not so sure about the safety of this car. I really wouldn't recommend it to any one to drive. Lets put it this way, when friends come over and want to go to the store real quick, if they ask to use my car, I flat out tell them no. I just do not have enough confidence in this car to let anyone else drive it and feel good about it.<br><br>
