            When we purchased our Honda Passport used in October 1998, I fell in love. For the first few months I adored it. My kids loved the room for them and they're friends I loved the versitility. But later, however, problems occured. While driving at night, the car stalled repedetly. I finally pulled over and called a tow truck. It turned out the car needed a new clutch! I said fine, guessing that it would take an hour and I would have the car back. But I fount out that the whole process took over nine hours! They had to remove the engine and transmition to get to the clutch. It cost me $1,200 out of pocket. I had no problem with the clutch after the work. The ride is bumpy and a bit jittery. Some stuff will rattle when driving on smooth roads,(and we have lots of dirt roads in our area!) I still like taking it on trips, I drive it on the beach and the four wheel drive is great. The only thing I dont like about it is that I have to stop the vehicle, shift into four wheel drive, then continue. It's getting a little old, but I think I'll hold on to it for a while. It's handy to haul kids to soccer practice, the carpool, or taking the bikes on the hitch. Keep on trukin'!<br><br>
