            We just bought the Saturn LS series because it's the best car to be towed by an RV.  So since we have a RV we found it best to get the Saturn.  Because it is a light weight car that miles don't come up on the speedometer while it is being towed.  

What I loved about the Saturn is the way that it drives.  This car is great. You can ride around in it and it feels so nice and safe.  It isn't a very bumpy ride.  It's just like smooth sailing.  Also I like how the doors are not metal.  That they are plastic and that it is very hard for them to dent.  THat is a great thing to know.  Also this car doesn't rust.  So it can be good for years to come.  There's nothing more you can ask for that you don't get with the Saturn.

This is the nicest car to drive.  I just Love the way the Saturn is made.  The people at the dealer are really nice. They try to make you feel like part of the Saturn family

I think that anyone can buy this car.  that anyone should buy it.  It's a great car for any thing.  THey even have a 3-door coupe which would be a great car for teens to have. If you are the type of person that wants t have a car that lasts and won't dent really easily then Saturns the car for you.   There is a few things that Saturn does that no dealer does.  Say your car is dirty all u have to do is go to the dealer and they will wash it for free.  Isn't that a deal.  They also have a 30 day buy back guarntee that if you aren't satisfied with the Saturn you can return it within 30 days or 3000 miles and get all of your money back.  Now do many car dealers do that. No. so think about how great Saturn is.
