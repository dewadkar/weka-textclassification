            I compared the ES300 to a number of similar cars and found that there isn't much that truly compares with it in its class.  In the nearly three years that I have had it, it has needed no maintenance other than scheduled service.  This impresses me as I have owned a number of domestic and foreign vehicles in this class over the past 15 years and most demonstrated an annoying array of unacceptable flaws and quality lapses.  There are two highly-rated manufacturers (who shall remain nameless) whose products I would not touch again under any circumstances.

Although I only have 23,000 miles on the clock the car still performs as well as it did the day I picked up.  It has plenty of power, tight handling, luxurious appointments and a straightforward ergonomic design. 

I wouldn't want to sit in the back behind someone with the front seat all the way back but then, I don't drive from back there.  

All in all, this is the best car that I have ever owned and there is no way that I will not replace it with a new Lexus when the lease expires.<br><br>
