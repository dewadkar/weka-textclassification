            The Honda Civic sedan is an excellent solution to the constant dilemma of finding the perfect car.  It is a combination of both safety and cost- effectivity.  It is on Consumer Reports list of the safest 50 cars on the market currently.  It is important to know that when you are getting into a car, that your life is not in danger.  The Honda Civic is also very inexpensive comparatively to other sedans on the market.
 
I own a Honda civic and enjoy every ride in it.  There are only a few aspects of the car that I do not like.  The first is rather minute compared to all of the good aspects of the car, but i do not like the cup holders.  They are not adjustable and they are very large.  I sometimes find myself buying a large drink in order to make it fit in my cup holders.  Another aspect that I do not like is that the EX edition, or the more luxurious model can only come with a sun roof.  I do not like sun roofs and was somewhat forced to get the LX model.  The dealership that I bought my car from made it possible for me to get a cd player in my car although the LX model usually comes with a tape player.  Another bad aspect is that you cannot have both a cd player and a tape player in the car.  Although this is usually only available in luxury cars, I think it would be better if this car was able to have both.
