            I just leased my first car and it happened to be 2000 Jetta. Why? For the same price I could have gotten Honda, the most stolen car in the US, Nissan Altima, which reverted back to 1993-1997 design, or some silly Mitsubishi which is supposed to be so sexy and all. I got Jetta because it has style, looks, and a lot of options that are standard (Honda charges extra for every floormat). Jetta provides a nice ride, good value for the money, and a great feeling of realizing that you finally are driving a German automobile.

Gas mileage leaves much to be desired (24/31). The vehicle has a 2 year bumper-to-bumper warranty, 10 year warranty on powertrain, and 12 years of warranty against corrosion (living in Michigan where they drop huge amounts of salt on the roads in winter, I am sure to appreciate this). The manual transmission feels tight and has a funny peculiarity for reverse gear (you have to shift it up, not down!). The GLS trim offers several options (Monsoon stereo, cold weather package, leather, alloy wheels, etc.). The colors of the 2000 line are spectacular. The silver arrow color is in highest demand nowadays and dealerships feel free to charge you extra just for the color. 2.0 engine provides regular  pick-up and acceleration, whereas 1.8 Turbo lets you can really feel the road and control traction.

Overall I think that Jetta is not the cheapest vehicle out there, but for the money it does provide a lot of bang. This car is not for everyone. But if you appreciate quality and style, buy it.  <br><br>
