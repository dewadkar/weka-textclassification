            I bought my Mazda626 about a 1 1/2 years ago.  It's a 1986, but I love it.  It has never let me down.  It has minor upkeep since I bought it, and had the same before so.  I have put very little into this car, and have received nothing but greatness.

Although I am looking at buying a new car...my Mazda will remain my baby.  When I do get that new car, it too will be a Mazda.  I have owned other cars, but none impressed me as much.

I love manuals, and my 626 is smooth and performs nicely.  I learned to drive a manual in this car, and am very thankful I did.  It was a great experience and I picked up fast.  I tried to learn in other cars, but shifting gears didn't go as smoothly.

I recommend a Mazda to almost all my friends, as the upkeep for me has been minimal.  As I hate to typecast, I am a typical clueless female when it comes to working on cars...so for others like myself I would recommend this car.<br><br>
