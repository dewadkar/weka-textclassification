            This 2-megapixel camera has an abundance of features including an optical zoom (as well as a digital zoom, but that is somewhat of an irrelevant gimmick, more on that later), self-timer, movie recording and a sliding lens cover.

The 3x optical zoom is obviously very valuable. For a camera of this price, consider it a gift! There is also a digital zoom, but be forewarned. Please ignore the digital zoom when shopping around for cameras as digitally zooming in on an object is the exact same thing as taking a picture of the entire object and then cropping out the relevant portion. In other words, you simply lose clarity in the desired image. The optical zoom is what really matters.

Also, the camera has movie recording. For the price, having this feature is great.

The sliding lens cover protects the lens from unwanted foreign particles. I love the camera for this reason, because through my experience with other cameras, it is really a nuisance to have to constantly clean the lens because of dust accumulation. Also, without a lens cover, it is very possible for a small scratch to ruin all your pictures, and that simply would be horrible!

There is also a self-timer. If you are tired of being excluded from all the pictures you take of other people, this feature will help you out immensely.

The main negative aspects of this camera are the lack of buttons for very important functions, such as the aforementioned self-timer, and the length of time taken between pictures. Hence, you will have to fiddle around a bit to set up the self timer as opposed to having it set by the instant push of a button. Also, this camera may not be the best idea if you plan on taking shots in quick succession.

Some people may think the battery life is a problem, yet all digital cameras experience this. These are not film cameras and should not be compared to them in this regard. The LCD screen is the biggest drain of the battery, so please refrain from constantly viewing your images in the LCD. With this camera, I highly recommend buying rechargeables because, especially at the beginning, your battery will probably die much more frequently than you would like due to your inexperience using digital cameras.

All in all, this camera is simply amazing for the price! If you are looking for an extremely reliable camera with 4x or 6x optical zoom, 3 or 4 megapixels, very long movie recording ability, and buttons for functions such as the self-timer, you should undeniably look to spend a great deal more. Yet, if the specifications of this camera are what you want, almost no other great camera will beat the price!
