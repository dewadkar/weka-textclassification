            Have you ever sat in a seat? I am not talking about on a seat, I am talking about when you sit down and the seat seems to conform to your body. If you have not then you haven't experienced a Monte Carlo firsthand. I love this car, my family loves this car, everyone I know who rides in it loves this car.

The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is truly a car that is &quot;Driven By Excitement&quot;. The steering responds to the slightest movement, the accelerator responds to the faintest touch, the cornering capabilities are awesome. The Monte Carlo was purchased as a 'family sports car' for my family and has lived up to every expectation we had. All of us can ride comfortably, front or back seat. 

Now, 'family sports car' is not to say that this is a car just for families. It has plenty of spunk to get you to the grocery store and plenty of spunk to beat the car sitting next to you off of the line at the red light! You mash the gas pedal and this baby gets up and goes. This is a superbly designed car for an average family of four, or a superbly designed car for a younger soul who feels the need for speed!

This is the first Monte Carlo we have owned, but I can say here that it will not be the last...<br><br>
