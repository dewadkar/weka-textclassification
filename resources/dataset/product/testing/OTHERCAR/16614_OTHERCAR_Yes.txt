            Recently my wife bought a cadillac catera.  We started looking for a car for her about a month go.  She was interested in a luxury car that had the simple luxuries like leather seats, cd  player ect...  What we found in the Catera was much much better.  Not only is it a fast car and has great handling but to me it defines a luxury car.  My favorite feature are the heated seats.  Something that has warmed me up wether i was snowboarding, sledding with my kids or it was just a really cold night.  The quality of the leather seats also amaze me.  When we were shopping for cars we sat in everycar we were interested in, the catera had the best seats. Well, if your looking for a car ranging in price(20,000-30,000) and has luxury comparable to a bmw, or lexus, the catera is for you.  Give it a test  drive.<br><br>
