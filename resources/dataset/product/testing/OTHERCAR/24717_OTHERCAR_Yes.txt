            After much research into the digital camera world (which left me more confused than when I started), I decided to play it safe and go with Sony.  After all, their brand name carries the weight.

I was not disappointed.  The DSC-S70 is a fantastic digital camera.  It has enough features to keep an amateur (very amateur) photographer busy for a long time.

The Good:

The resolution at 3.3 megepix is amazing.  The DSC-S70 also does incredible macro shots, something other camera's I have seen seem to have trouble with.  

The Memory Stick format is Sony Proprietary, meaning that you can't use it with anything else except other Sony devices, but it is actually cheaper than comparable flash RAM used in other cameras.

The number of accessories is growing, but somewhat limited.  I just ordered the strong arm flash for the DSC-S70, as the built in flash is close to useless.  I have yet to take a decent picture using the incorporated flash.

The USB Memory Stick adapter is a must have accessory.  It allows you to transfer your pics without hooking the camera up to the computer, a nice feature.  Speaking about the USB transfer, it is fast.  Very fast.  If you have ever downloaded pictures using the old serial method you will be in love with the USB connection.

The Bad:

Built in Flash:  Useless.  Hopefully the external flash will save nightshots for the DSC-S70.

Support:  Am I the only one that thinks the Sony Web site is completely insane in its layout?  Finding drivers and files is next to impossible.  On a recent trip I forgot to load the USB driver onto my notebook.  I subsequently spent an hour surfing Sony's site (long distance from Grenada, mind you) to find the 59KB driver.  Which I found by accident.

Take my advice.  Burn copies of every driver and the PDF manual onto a CD and throw it in your camera bag.

Other than that, the DSC-S70 is a champ in all respects.  With a little practice, and patience with Sony, you won't be disappointed.
