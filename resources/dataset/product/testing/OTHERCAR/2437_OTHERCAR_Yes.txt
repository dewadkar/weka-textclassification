            Please read this review along with the 'Just Doesnt measure up' review. I believe the author has done a good job for the most part, but renting a Montero is not the same as owning one. Having owned a 2002 Montero Limited for more than a year, I can agree with most of his observations - e.g. the 3.5L V6 is not really enough for such a heavy vehicle, it does feel a little tippy through hair-pin bends, it does recommend Premium fuel. However, Mitsubishi has already fixed all these problems and more in the 2003 model. The suspension has been redesigned and traction control is standard - also a new stability control feature has been added, again standard. The engine has been upgraded from the 3.5L 200HP V6 to a 3.8L 215HP V6. Also, the new engine does NOT require premium unleaded fuel anymore. Kudos to the folks at Mitsubishi for 'listening'.

I wanted to touch some aspects of the Montero that were not covered by the previous author. For one, if you want an "SUV" that can beat a Civic on the drag strip, then you should get a Toyota Highlander or an Acura MDX, not an SUV. If you want an "SUV" that does not feel tippy on curves, you need to get a minivan or a sports car, not an SUV. But if you want an SUV that feels like a truck, rides like a car, has loads of room and sticks to the surface - whether its wet, icy or off-road - then you want to get a Montero. There is a reason why this truck is so popular in the rest of the world - because it is one of the best off-roaders money can buy. Because not everyone has freeways laid out for them and people in some countries have to carve their own roads in the terrain. Its no surprise the Montero (or Pajero as it's called elsewhere) keeps winning the grueling Dakar rally, year after year (nobody even dares to enter this world-renowned desert rally with a Toyota 4Runner or a Ford Expedition)

In fact, the only other SUV which is equipped with a 4WD transfer case similar to that of the Montero, is the Hummer!! I even had a personal incident when I went skiing recently, that reminded me of my trucks potential. The parking lot was so icy that the Ford Expedition parked next to me had trouble backing out. I just had to shift my 4WD to LLC and presto... I was doing all kinds of stunts and the truck just stuck to the ice like it was asphalt. The only time I felt I was on ice was when I slammed the brakes (the ABS went off and I could feel it assist the brakes). The best thing about the Montero is that you can shift to AWD (all wheel drive) or 4WD on the fly. If you feel the roads are slippery, just shift to AWD and you can actually feel the added traction.

As far as looks are concerned, Mitsubishi has taken a bold and awesome approach - their design team has somehow managed to keep the tough truck-like look without making it look like a box on wheels (Hummer??). In fact, its the great looks of the new Montero that made me walk into the showroom the first time!

Another unexpected surprise from the new Montero was the comfort. I got mine used - got a 2002 model, in 2002, with 10K miles, for $27K. It's as good as new and you can use the ignorance of the used car market to your advantage (I saved $10K). I was considering a used Audi A8 too, but after test driving both, I was surprised how a german luxury sedan did not have the same riding comfort as the Montero!!

Bottom line is... the Montero is no pickup-truck modified to look like an SUV (4Runner??) or an elevated sedan (Highlander??). This is a thoroughbred SUV that was built ground up to do what an SUV should do. I hope the next version of the Montero has a GPS and V8 optional, a better looking console and lighter components to help shed some pounds. That would make it THE perfect SUV!!!
