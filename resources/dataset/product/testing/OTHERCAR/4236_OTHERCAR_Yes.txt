            *UPDATE---If you want this car, NOW is the time to buy it! GM just came out today (Jan. 4, 02) with 2,002 rebate on the 2002 Aztec! I had a feeling there would be a rebate soon since car buying season is over. TAKE ADVANTAGE! Luckily, I still get the rebate price! YES! So I will adjust my paying price on the bottom of this review accordingly!

As soon as I saw this car in a GM brochure, I immediately fell in love with it. The brochure I had was a 2001 version, and when I saw the 2002 Aztec, I knew that I HAD to have this car. The 2002 model looks EVEN better than last years. 

The following feature I explain are part of the package I received on my Aztec. I got the front wheel drive Aztec with the 1SD package. This the highest end package available. For more info on the lower end packages and standard features, I found them at www.pontiac.com
click on "Aztec". You can build your car there, or check out the stats. It is fun.

I love that you can get a fully loaded luxury interior for such an affordable price. I have always wanted a ride that had leather seats and a premium sound system.... and this SRV has that and so much more. 
1)Power outlets.... I know this will make vacuuming the inside much easier.
2)HUD (heads up display).... I am so excited to have this in my SRV. My dad has this in his Caddy Coupe. It projects your speed and other info onto the lower windshield so you can see it while driving. No excuses for speeding tickets, eh?
3)On-Star.... I understand that this feature gives any help or info at the touch of a button, like nearest ATM or gas station, etc. It can also send a signal to unlock your car incase you get locked out. I don't know first hand about this feature because I opted for the power moonroof instead. It is either one or the other.
4)Heated 6 way power seats. Also a Caddy feature, but not for a Caddy price :)
5)security alarm
6)leather wrapped steering wheel with radio controls. I upgraded to the 6 disc in dash with 10 premium speakers. The radio controls are right there on your steering wheel so you don't have to look away or reach for the controls while driving. Of course, there are the main controls still in the usual place.
7)tinted glass comes on all packages, I believe. COOL feature
8)remote keyless entry!!!
9)sliding cargo tray.... can hold I think up to 400 pounds to slide in and out for easier loading and unloading. Also has compartments that lift up to hold in groceries, or what not. Is removable.
10)traction control.... since I did not get All Wheel Drive, traction control is the next best thing. It helps in icey or wet conditions, which is all I would have used AWD in anyhow.

11)leather interior.... comes standard in the 1SD package group. Ahhhh. Leather!

***12) Forgot to add another cool feature!!!- As you accelerate, the volume on the stereo goes up slightly, and visa versa as you start to slow down. COOL!!!

I will not comment on the vehicle's performance yet. I will come back and review that after I have had it for a while so I can offer a thorough review.

I love this vehicle because I am a young mother of 2, and is so much cooler than a minivan, roomier than a car, but not as masculine as a traditional SUV. 

The price I got it for is the military price. We got ours from our AAFES New Car Sales dealer. So we pay under MSRP, and about 3-5% above dealer invoice. You can still bargain for it and get the price we got, considering that we got the most expensive package w/ leather, and every upgraded option (stereo, moonroof,). If you can find out what the dealer invoice price is, then go up from there, and NOT over the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). 5%, maybe even 3% or 4%, above invoice is a good deal. Don't let the dealer pull that, "I am not making any money off this sale." Bull! If they don't tell you the dealer invoice, then thank them, and let them know you will find a dealer who does. Some dealerships will refuse, because they don't want you to know where to start off bargaining. The dealer invoice (what the dealer paid) for the model I got with all the options, it is APPROX. $23,000 give or take. I do not remember. That is your starting off point for bargaining. You can also look up car buying tips online, maybe even from this site. Check it out before you make a deal. Good luck! ***UPDATE- Corey76 has informed me of a site that will allow you to see the invoice for any car. You really should know the dealer invoice and MSRP for the exact model you want with all the options you want. Here is the site-

Make sure you get the whole address in there. I checked it out, and you need to know which options you want and their code numbers. You find all that out by building your car first (don't worry, it's just for fun) at www.pontiac.com as I stated above.
