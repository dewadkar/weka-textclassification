            What can I say about the Pontiac Grand Prix? There are many things.  First of all, I own one and I am getting ready to buy a new one. They are a great car for the price.  It is sporty, comfortable, and a joy to drive. It handles really great especially around corners, it has great acceleration, and is pretty good on gas mileage. The heads up display option (windshield speedometer) makes driving easier so you can keep your eyes on the road. Then for people like like sports cars and don't have a whole lot of money for a real sports car like the Firebird, Camaro, or Corvette, this is the car for you. I love mine and I can wait to get my new one. So I will say that whoever buys one will not be disappointed in their purchase. Just remember &quot;Wider is Better&quot;.<br><br>
