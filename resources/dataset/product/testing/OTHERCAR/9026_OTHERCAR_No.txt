            We recently took a test ride in a 2000 Sportage EX. The Window price was over $21,000. For considerably less we have found alternatives. Our interest is in a four wheel drive. The turning radius and center of gravity height, makes for a &quot;tippy&quot; vehicle. Our needs were for some off road driving to a building site and the ground clearance of only 7.9 inches was need deemed satisfactory for our needs. We found the detail of the interior as only satisfactory for a car of that price. There where too many &quot;common&quot; details that we find in a car of only 12-14K. <br><br>
