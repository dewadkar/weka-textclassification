            Looking for my first car to purchase once I graduated college, I spent hours researching, test driving, and debating over which automobile I wanted to start my new life in.  The Durango above all other SUV's on the market caught my eye from the beginning. The sleek body but tough body, looks almost like an alligator driving down the road.  One key piece to owning your own vehicle, it has to be pleasing to your eye.  If you don't like the way your vehicle looks, your not going to be happy driving it. The Durango has all the features that can make an SUV owner drool over.  
The interior of the vehicle is everything you could ask for in an automobile. Plentiful head and arm room to comfortable seats, including the 3rd optional seat.  Surprising enough the 3rd seat is as comfortable as the drivers.  The seating is also very high on the road which makes for a great view of on coming traffic and the feeling of being in control.  
The handling is great for a large vehicle. I have just driven my Durango in snow for the first winter and it has handled it very well.  Corners are no problem, the turning radius is very good.  
Great options available on this vehicle including: CD player, leather seats, steering wheel controls for the radio, defrost on side rear view mirrors; make driving this vehicle feel like you are driving a luxury automobile.  
One draw back to the Durango is the full economy. Only getting about 12 mile per gallon city and 17 miles per gallon highway. This is not a car you would want to commute an hour each way, every day.  
Overall this this has been a great vehicle I would recommend this to anyone that is seeking a SUV that can handle anyone from a sportsman (off road driving) to a family that needs the space and comfort of a large vehicle.
