            Those of you, who have read my previous reviews know that I tend to be a careful shopper.  Not so with this camera.  After tremendous success with my Fugifilm A203 and A303, I was ready to make the jump to a more capable camera.  I initially looked at the Fujifilm S602 but was deterred  from buying it due to my substantial investment in xD memory, which the S602 does not take.  I also looked into the Canon Digital Rebel, due to it&#146s interchangeable lenses and true SLR design, even though it was more expensive than the S602.  If it had used the xD chip and AA batteries, I might have splurged, but I didn&#146t .

When the S-7000 was announced, I went crazy.   Finally the camera I wanted that used the memory I already had.  I begun anxiously awaiting the initial delivery date, even going as far as writing Fuji to see when the actual ship date was going to be.  For over a month I waited for one of the trusted retailers to have the camera in stock.  Finally during the last week in October, I was able to place the order.  One of the major disadvantages of being &#147the first kid on the block&#148 with a new toy is that you usually pay too much.  This indeed the case with my purchase.  I paid $699 but now you can get the same camera for under $600.  Even though I paid too much, I have not been disappointed.

If I had waited to see the reviews on Epinions.com, I am not sure I would have purchased the camera.  I am glad I did not read the reviews.  So far the camera has been great and I have taken some awesome  images.

My first fun shoot was an image rich environment.  One of the local nurseries supplies poinsettia to the wholesale market throughout the southeast US.  Yearly, just before they ship, they have an open  house where you can drive and walk through the nursery, viewing over 100,000 individual poinsettia plants.  It is so beautiful that it takes your breath away.  I shot over 200 images in the hour or so that we were there.  The combination of blue sky, white framed greenhouses and the multicolored hues were a  photographer&#146s dream come true.

I had only had the camera for about a week so I was mostly shooting in auto mode.  The images that I captured are as breathtaking as the original scenes.  I found the camera as easy to use in this mode as the point and shoot cameras but it was nice to play with selective focus and bracketing exposures.  The basic operations are much like the A203 but with a world of feature there if you choose to use them. I mostly shot at 3 megapixel but did shoot a few at the 6 megapixel setting.

Within a couple of hours I printed several 8x10 on my home printer that created many oohs and ahs among family and friends.  One of the images was so sharp that my wife insisted that I have it turned into a 20"x30" blow up for part of her Christmas decorations.  Even with inexpensive poster printing (Walmart.com $20 plus shipping) The image is stunning.  It was the talk of many a holiday gatherings at our home.  Maybe it is my untrained eye, but I just don&#146t see the excessive noise that has been noted in previous reviews.
						
Features I like:
The electronic viewfinder is great.  Being able to adjust the eyepiece to your individual vision is nice to have. 


 The 5 fps and last 5fps sequence modes are great for action photography, something I had troubles with when using point and shoot cameras.  

The f button is nice as it allows you to rapidly change resolution, ISO and film type (chrome, normal and B&W). 

 The macro modes are fantastic.  The super macro mode allows you to focus down to 0.4cm.  Even everyday objects take on an artistic look when imaged at that range.  I cant wait for springtime do some great flower shots.

OK, I admit, nothing is perfect.  Here are the few bugs I have found.

When changing from photographic to view mode, if you go slightly past the detent, the camera tuns off and you have to cycle the camera fully off then turn it back on.  I have done this way to many times already.  I wish there was a single button that you could  use to review the last shot.

It gets a little confusing sometimes when you try to change a menu setting.  There is a setting position on the main mode selector that deals with most important setup functions but then there are menus also accessible  from the picture taking and viewing modes (accessed by pressing the enter button) It get a little confusing when you remember a certain menu function but can&#146t find what menu it was on.  I still keep the owners manual handy for such searching.

It would have been nice to have the adapter tube come standard with the camera so that you can add filters right away without having  to purchase something else.  From what I have seen it is included with the S5000. You would think they would include it with the high end camera as well.

It also would have been nice if they had included the exceptional 10x optical zoom from the S5000.  I have  recommended the S5000 to several of my friends who don't require the higher resolution of the S7000 just because of that feature.

In the end, this is a great camera.  It will do everything I want it to do until the newer models come out (which in this rapidly changing world will be next week).  If you are moving up to digital from 35mm SLRs I think you will be happy with this camera.
