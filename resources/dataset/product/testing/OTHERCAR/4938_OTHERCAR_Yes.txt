            I bought my truck new, and now have about 60,000 miles on it.  Here are some of my experiences:

Pros: 
- I am a big guy (6'7") and this truck is very comfortable for me as a driver.
- 5.0L V8 has plenty of power.

Cons:
- The transmission went out on my at 41,000 miles - just barely out of warranty.  GM told me to pound sand, and i had to eat the entire $2000 replacement cost.
- The back seat is small.  You really can't sit behind me at all, and if you have kids or car seats its very tight. 
- This was the first year of the 3rd door, and why they put it on the passengers side is beyond me.  By 2001 it comes on both doors - but I never use mine.
- It gets pretty crummy mileage in the city (13mpg), ok on the highway (20mpg).  This is to be expected I guess, but for a while there it was costing me $40+ to fill up.
