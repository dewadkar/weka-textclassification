            Just wanted to drop a line and thank you for allowing me to participate in the survey for the 2000 Chevy Impala.  My first car was a �64 Impala, so I am another Impala story.  I think almost everyone has an Impala story.  I traded in my 1995 Beretta Z26 for a 2000 black Chevy Impala LS, and I could not be happier with any automobile on the road.  My Impala has all the options of a car that should cost thousands more, and I have NEVER had a vehicle that has inspired more smiling and interested glances.  I get compliments on �her� from young and old alike, and it�s a very �head-swelling� experience to own this car.  I have been stuck in traffic on a Little Rock freeway and had a teenage boy roll his window down to ask me what kind of car I was driving.  He said it was gorgeous.  I am always getting smiles and thumbs up from people on this car.  It is wonderful.  It has plenty of power, looks great, rides great, it�s safe, and is part of an American institution that is rooted in our culture. I was extremely  excited  Chevy brought the Impala back, and although I am a single 30 year old male, I feel like this car was built for me.

Admittedly, this new Impala is different from the previous cars it shares its name with, but I believe this new Impala is here as a domestic and import fighter, and as far as I am concerned, it is very well equipped and more than able to carry its head high against its competition.  To sum it up, I love my Impala, and the torch has been passed to the 2000 model.
