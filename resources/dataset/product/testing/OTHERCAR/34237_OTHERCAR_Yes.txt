            I have always wanted a convertible, but I didn't want to sacrifice the spaciousness of a 4 door.  After being crammed in the tiny backseats of many 2 door sports cars, I vowed never to buy a 2 door. However, finally, in 2000, Toyota solved my dilemma with the release of the Solara. I was on a waiting list for 3 months, but it was worth it. The reliability of Toyota is always a plus, but even I was astounded by the quiet ride of this convertible. The backseat is also the same size as the normal 4 door Camry, so my dream of a spacious 2 door has finally been fulfilled. There is even a power outlet for my cell phone charger, so I won't lose my cigarette lighter under my seat anymore. I have almost had my Solara for a year, and I haven't had any kind of mechanical problem. The only problem I've had at all is that you must secure the right side of the convertible top tightly first or the top will not fit snugly. This is not a major problem though. I am thoroughly satisfied.
