               I must be honest, I have never been a Mopar fan. I have heard about, and seen for myself, far too many bad experiences. So why did I go ahead and get one? From all of the latest commercials I had thought that maybe they did &quot;Change the rules&quot; and took care of some of the obvious flaws in their vehicles. Instead of buying the truck I leased it thinking that this would be a better way to put Dodge to the test rather than getting stuck with the truck.
   I am in the construction business and carry quite a few tools in my trucks. This is when I noticed the first problem. I hadn't loaded more than 100 pounds in the back when I noticed that the moon was shining brighter than usual. The head lights didn't hardly touch the road it squatted so badly.
   The second problem I experienced was that at or around the speed of 45 mph, the truck had a definite bouncing in the ride, (on roads that I know are fairly smooth riding). Something was not balanced very well in the drive shaft. After 6 visits to the warranty shop and many tire balancing jobs, nothing has changed. I had to chuckle though at one of the warranty visits, the mechanic tried to mention something about a possible problem with the transfer case but the service manager quickly, and obviously interrupted him. I just gave up on that one, I was tired of driving the &quot;loaner minivan&quot;.
   The third major problem with the truck is that it seems to burn more than just gasoline. I have to fill the transmission fluid, the oil, and the antifreeze about every third month. I don't know where all these fluids are going because I don't have any visible spots on my garage floor.
   The interior of the truck is really nice though. The extras such as the cup-holders, stereo system, electronic compass, thermometer, and the seats are nice. The doors could be adjusted better to put an end to the whistling wind outside, and they might have to do something about the design on the quad cab frame. There is a large &quot;blind spot&quot; which is caused by the extra reinforced frame in front of the passenger door.
   I think that Dodge should pay more attention to the mechanics instead of the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; I know that I have learned my lesson, I wonder when Dodge will.<br><br>
