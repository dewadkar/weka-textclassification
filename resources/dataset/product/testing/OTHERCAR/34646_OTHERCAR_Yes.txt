            With a three year old and one on the way, we finally realized it was time to break down and buy either, an SUV or a minivan.  I was pro minivan the whole way, my husband on the other hand, got hooked on the SUV's.  He just wasn't ready for the FamVan look just yet.  We went to a dealership intending to look at some Jeeps, and other SUV's and the owner of the dealership came out and started building up the Montana.  He and his wife have one, and so do each of the their kids and their families.  What finally hooked my husband was the gas mileage, 25+ miles per gallon in town and on the highway.  The cool sporty look inside and out, not to mention the child integrated car seat and the separate jacks for our three year old to listen to her own music, (we were getting tired of the Tarzan soundtrack, Phil Collins is great and all, but for all 7 hours every time we go to Colorado to see family!)  So, we took it out for a test drive, even on the heavily beaten roads around our town due to all the road construction, it was a luxury car ride.  And boy could it accelerate.  Even with the air-conditioner going full-blast, we were up to 60 in 7 seconds or so as we got on the highway.  The only draw back that we see are the cup holders.  We just don't like the design up front for the driver and the front passenger.  It sit's on the floor next to the passenger seat.  We just don't trust them.  I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a minivan console/organizer to go between these seats.  Cups are much more manageable now.  Our van is red over charcoal, with light grey interior, and charcoal dash.  We haven't taken our van on a long trip yet, but have little doubt that we will love it.  For this Kansas family, our Montana is perfect.  We have a minivan that my husband is comfortable in (Did I mention he is 6'3')? and sees as a cool alternative to the SUV's, and I got the room I needed with the convenience and luxury ride I was looking for, not to mention the great gas mileage.  The Pontiac Montana is probably the best kept secret in the minivan world.  With everyone going for the Windstars, and Ventures, take a look at Montana.  You won't regret it. <br><br>
