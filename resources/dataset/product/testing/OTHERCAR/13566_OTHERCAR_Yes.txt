            We were a 5 member 2 car family with three dogs.  We had a snug fitting 4 door blazer for comfort and a roomy 2 door bronco for work and hauling a tractor.  With that there were two tag bills, two insurance bills and with growing frequency two maintenance bills.  We decided it was time to find something to meet all our needs in one hardworking, roomy, comfortable riding vehicle.  SUVs were out because they lacked the power and stability required with regular towing.  We wondered about a four door trucks.  I checked consumer opinions with my insurance company and while the Ford satisfaction was listed as good.  The Chevy was listed as overall outstanding.  We didn't consider the Dodge because while they offered a 4 door option, I wasn't interested in their model because the doors opened like my 62 ford van did where the front had to open before the rear. So just to see what it was like we test drove the Chevys. We all fell in love with the space available in the cab.  I didn't like the duely because the ride was too rough for our daily routine while obviously it would have worked fine in a work only application.  The single rear wheel model 3500 was all together different.  We got a super smooth, quiet ride at all speeds.  Handling was very responsive and the acceleration was impressive especially given the size of the vehicle.  We decided right then we wanted this truck  It had all the cargo space we needed, all the power we needed for towing the tractor, and it had plenty of comfort features.  We got every option available to include 4X4 and skid plates except the cd player since they did not offer a deck or multi cd player.  Some pluses for this truck is that it does not sit real high off of the ground.  I have plenty of ground clearance for my needs but my small children and 5'3&quot; wife can get in and out without a step stool or ladder.  The stereo system is great and has an auto adjust feature for road noise.  But the ride is so quiet it doesn't kick in.  The 454 motor has power and you can feel it when you need it.  It gets the same mileage as my 1980 CJ5 with a 6 banger.  If I had to complain about anything it would be that initially the paint had some problems on the hood and the leather seat on the driver's side wore too quickly but the dealership jumped on it and took care of it as soon as I brought it to their attention.  How does it drive?  Like a dream come true.  You can't park it in small spots, the turn radius is larger than small cars and shorter trucks but that shouldn't be a surprise.  If the station wagons of the 90's, aka SUVs don't quite meet your needs and you want a hard working, tough durable, comfortable riding all around super family vehicle this one is for you.  This is a real truck with all the features that make driving it a real pleasure.  If you have a lot of friends who are always moving from apartment to apartment you don't want one of these.    <br><br>
