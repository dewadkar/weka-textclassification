            The SONY Mavica is my third digital camera, and now after 24 hours of owning it, it's my favorite.  Easy to use, it seems to do everything well.  The 10x zoom is great and it saves pictures on 3.5&quot; floppies in .JPG format which go right into the computer with no complicated software.  The built in flash and numerous on board options allow this camera to be near perfect for any situation.  The Mavica is neither big nor heavy and is ideal for anyone travelling.  Readily available 3.5'&quot; floppies give the vacationer or tourist the ability to take unlimited pictures while travelling.  As a confirmed 35mm camera enthusiast I really dislike digital cameras, but in the case of the SONY Mavica, MVC-FD73, I gladly make an exception.  The Mavica is probably going to give my closet full of 35mm equipment a lot of competition.  I love it.<br><br>
