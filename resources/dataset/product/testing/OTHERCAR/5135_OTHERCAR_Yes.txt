            After owning a 1999 R/T and taking advantage of the buyback program by Chrysler, I took delivery of my 2000 R/T on December 23, 1999, my Christmas present to myself.  After driving my 'old' R/T only 5400 miles and reading a not too flattering article in Motor Trend magazine, I was curious too see if Dodge was able to increase the performance of the truck.

My 1999 R/T Club Cab was impressive looking, fast, good top end speed, but not quick, as confirmed in the Motor Trend article and suffered noticeable hesitation in shifting at highway speeds. Fuel economy was as expected, the truck was noisy, but a good noisy, full of deep bass exhaust sound. The interior was austere by new car standards, no leather available, etc.

My 2000 R/T Club Cab seems significantly quicker, with an even better top end and smoother shifting at highway speeds.  I had a friend, a former short track, stock car owner/driver, drive both vehicles on several occasions and he confirmed the 2000 was significantly quicker.  The exhaust noise seems more 'throaty' as well.  I ordered all options available on the 2000 and the interior still seems austere, but with more comfortable bucket seats. 

I was pleased with my 1999 R/T and would have recommended it to anyone but  the 2000 R/T exceeded my expectations, making it my best Christmas present ever. <br><br>
