            Ok, I admit it ... I have been a fan of high performance luxury German cars and have rarely ever considered any American performance luxury (except, perhaps, the new Vette Z06).

Wow, did I ever get a wake-up call with this Mark VIII.

I had just returned from a posting overseas and needed some wheels so I went down to my local BMW/Mercedes dealer.  I asked the salesperson what was the very best value on his lot (from over 100 cars) and, without hesitation he pointed me to this lonely American Lincoln.  I almost fainted.  Anyway, he convinced me to sit in it, and drive it.

Time to wake up!

So, I bought it, at a fraction of what the comparable german car would have cost me.

Having now had it for 2 months and having put 12,000 miles on it (yes, that is correct, 12K miles in 2 months ... lots of high speed highway driving), I can say that this is one amazing car.

For reference, I have owned dozens of cars ... mostly high performance ... I am a car nut ... but almost all of the cars I have had have been German (aside from a Trans Am that I hated and a 340 Duster that was okay).

This Lincoln hums along at 85 MPH at about 2,000 RPM, and simply wants to go faster.  I read an article how a 1994 stock Mark viii was taken to Bonneville and topped at 180 MPH ... I'd believe it ... this car rocks!  I took it to 115 and the car was still purring, obviously still full of power.  And it does all of this with leather and climate control.  Nice touch Mr Detroit, and at a very small fraction of the cost of Mr. Berlin.

So, all of my buddies are devout German car owners (aside from the one NSX owner), and laugh at me when I drive up in my Lincoln ... until they get a ride ... or until they try to smoke me.  I have had a lot of fun with this car, "teaching" the naive.  By the way, I am a professor by trade!

As for reliability ... the car seems fine, if maintained (and who would NOT maintain a Lincoln?) ... except the headlights.  These things cannot be more than 1 candlepower.  They suck, suck, suck.  Aftermarket headlights are available, I've learned.  And the doors are huge (2 door) so parking can be interesting.  Else, everything about this car seems really cool.  4 days after buying it, I snapped the antenna in a car wash ... new one was only $40 ... do that on a BMW and you're out $250.  Gotta love American prices!

So, this will certainly be my baby for at least 9 months ... which is a lifetime for me, who normally switches cars every 2 or 3 months.

These cars are amazing.  You have to try one if you get a chance.  Unfortunately, surprisingly few of them were made.  But they are out there.
