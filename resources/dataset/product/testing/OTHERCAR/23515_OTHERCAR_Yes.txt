            After parting with my 94 RX-7, I wanted a car that combined the speed and poise of a sports car with the practicality of a sedan.  I stopped shopping when I found the S4.  When I first purchased the car I was amazed at the smooth ride and seamless torque provided by the 2.7l Bi-Turbo engine.  I have now put 15,000 miles on my silver S4, without a hitch.  The car performed flawlessly in late winter ice storms, and is wonderful to drive in good weather.  Despite the car's performance bent it is very comfortable for daily driving, with power available at nearly any engine speed. The seats are well designed without too much bolstering in the sides.  The interior is simple and elegant, true to German design, but not cold with stylish red illumination at night.  The automatic climate controls work very well, but can take a couple of minutes to cool on very hot days.  The radio is very good but will provide muddy bass when listening to Hip Hop style music.  The rear seats both fold flat to provide a huge storage area in the trunk when needed. Overall, the only dowside to this car is a smallish rear seat.  Legroom can be limited when the front seat are moved back to accommodate passengers over 6'.<br><br>
