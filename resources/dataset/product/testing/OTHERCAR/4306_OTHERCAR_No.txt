            The vehicle was originally bought because it was something different, and because of the nostalgia surrounding it.  After that wears off, it is just a car.  For some reason people love hitting this car, I am not sure why, but in parking lots, on the street, everywhere.  Truly overall it isn't a horrible vehicle, women love it.  It is very impracticle though.  I find the car grinding over speed bumps irregardless of how slow I go over them, no one over five feet can really sit in the back of the car, I have almost given people conclusions because of a large metal structure that sits right where their head should go, it is part of the hatch system, but it takes up a ton of inside space, and when people in the back turn to look out the window, smack.  

The dash is enormous, it is good because it really does give a feeling of open space, but it is in two pieces and the piece that is farther away begins to warp, and leaves a small gap where they are supposed to meet, Volkswagon tells me that this is normal, I tell them they are smoking crack.  The light grey headliner really does show its age quickly.  The stereo isn't to bad, I think they did a good job on the speakers, except that the last time I took my car in to be serviced one of the mechanics accidentally turned up my stereo when he was trying to turn it off and blew one of the speaker, and of course Volkswagon won't cover that.  

The windshield is also huge and loves to crack from any kind of rocks that hit it, I have had my car less then a year and I already have four HUGE cracks in it, it will have to be replaced.  The fog lamps are one of the dumbest things I have ever seem!  They make those lamps out of glass, the make the headlights out of plastic, well that fog light broke within two weeks of getting the car, one rock and bang.  I had two of these cars and the same thing happened to the other one around the same time, if you look at pretty much any Beetle you will find this to be true.  I asked Volkswagon is this was just a design flaw, and they said no because it was the rocks fault, I asked them that if they made a while car out of glass and said what a amazing car for the road, then had a rock hit the car and it shattered, would that be the rocks fault?  I was told yes.  To replace those lovely little fog lights you have to get Volkswagon to take the whole bumper off, a costly procedure, of course NOW you can buy little protectors, to bad someone didn't tell me that before.  

The part of the bumper that houses the foglights is made out of white plastic, you'll notice that pretty quick if you get any rocks or sand at all.  The gas cap is horizontal, so that during winter, bring a thermos of boiling water with you or it is impossible to open, again really smart on their part.  My tires continually leak, I have brought them in a bunch of times and they say that I picked up a nail.  Well last weekend I had the car in and by the time that I picked it up from the local Volkswagon dealer, apparently somewhere in their parking lot I picked up another nail, cute.  Overall, I think it is an alright car it has a decent amount of power, gas mileage is alright, it is not a highway car because it is geared to low which sucks.  It is pretty stable on ice and snow which is awesome, and overall is fun to drive, I do think that it would make a great rally car.  

If Volkswagon would have spend a few more moments thinking about the car they would have gotten it right.<br><br>
