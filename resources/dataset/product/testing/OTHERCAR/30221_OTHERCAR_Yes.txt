            Being a former windstar owner, I was excited to try the Odyssey which I had heard so much about.  Initial impression was that it was very plain inside (like all honda products), but after comparing all the comparable minivans, we took the plunge and are very happy with our choice. First of all I have to say, having three young children made us go from suv owners to embarassed but extremely happy minivan people.  There is no comparison between any of the midsize SUV's and the minivans with respect to ease of "strapping in" children, flexibility of seating, and overall useable space with three rows of seating.  We actually had a great experience for three years with a Ford windstar (leased), but were happy to have the lease come up, as it was starting to show its wear (many little things came up like difficulty with the auto sliding doors, and annoying noises, etc..), and the resale value was abysmal.  The Odyssey has been a step up in most ways, in particular the overall volume of space is much greater and more useable (compared with the 2000 Windstar), the ride is actually a lot smoother, and the cabin is much quieter on the highway than the windstar.  We took it on a 2000 mi road trip after having it for a month, and it meet all our expectations.  The only thing that I missed was the integrated compass and outside temp gauge like in the windstar.  The only negative thing is that the fuel gauge is useless, as the warning light comes on with about a quarter of a tank to go, giving you no idea just how far you really can push it.  Half of the trip we towed a 5x8 trailer and had almost no lag in pickup or loss of control, the engine is strong and solid (so far).  Overall, a great buy (especially when comparing comparably loaded sienna's and windstar's),  We love it and hope it continues to perform this well for many years.
