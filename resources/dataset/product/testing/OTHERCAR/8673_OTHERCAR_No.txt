            This is a great little camera! But the two notable exceptions to its greatness let me to take it back in exchange for the Olympus C-2100 UZ, which I like much better.

The most glaring fault is this camera's biggest selling point...the 10X optical zoom. Wonderful but almost unuseable for hand held. Only in bright light and with my hand propped against a solid object could I get an unblurred 10X shot. And if I want a camera small enough to fit in my pocket, then I'm certainly not in the market for lugging around a tripod!

The other fault is the lack of lens threading. So the only way to use filters is with a slip-on holder which is not a very satisfactory solution in my opinion. I prefer using a skylight filter to a lens cap, just to protect the lens. This option just isn't available on this camera.

Olympus does make wonderful cameras and I cannot recommend the brand more highly. But you can get the same lens and just about all of the features of the C-700 (with the notable exception of manual white balance) in the C-2100, which is available at CompUSA for $499. It's only a little larger, but not by any means too big or heavy to carry around (as my old Sony F-91 was!) The C-2100 also comes with rechargeable batteries and charger, as well as a remote control. The C-700 does not.

I do find the Olympus manuals, in general, and the C-700 in particular, not easy to understand. These cameras have a LOT of settings, so it's important to understand what they do. I ordered the manual from www.shortcourses.com and find it well worth the $21! They have a FREE pocket guide for the C-700, so if you decide on this camera...get it!
