            This is one of the most beautiful SUVs inside or outside to grace the American roads.  It seems that most of these vehicles are imported almost fully loaded: Tan color leather interior, electrically retractable moon roof, sophisticated AM/FM stereo with 5-disk cd player, automatic diming of the rearview mirrors (internal and external), compass in the rearview mirror, heads up sunglasses holder, Electrically movable front seats, combination heating/AC,  electric antenna, v6 engine and automatic transmission, full time all wheel drive, adjustable steering column, side inpact air-bags, dual front airbags, all electric windows, wood grain panelling details inside, leather covered steering wheel, dual sliding-tray console for driver and front passenger, electric door locks, electrically adjustable external rear view mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors on both sun shades. Extra 12 volt outlets in rear of driver's center console and one is in the trunk. Anti-lock brakes. Brakes are very effective, never seem to fade. Vehicle came with plush grey  front floor mats and rear cargo cover.  Very plush carpeting is found through out the entire vehicle.  Vehicle is based on a car chassis (this may account for the smalish cargo space), cruise control, dual lCD odometers with total mileage.  Built in Security system (replacement keys reportedly cost $300 each & I am steamed)provides good transmiter range for remote activation of all locks). Garage door opener in drivers sun visor will not operate code scambling garage openers.  Supplied with Goodyear radial tires. Outside temperature is displayed on the central white on blue information screen in the center of the dashboard.    Owners manual comes with signiture of builders in Japan showing pride of the workers and the company.

Security system defeats two American Automobile Club locksmith's piano-wire standard cardoor-opener and fired off audio alarms in response. Very difficult to break into.  Wallet card key with security code chip helps reduce chance of accidentally locking the driver out of the car with the ingnition key inside.  Key Grab:  The security system also provides some safety in that it will not release the key until the shift column is in park, and it will not let you start the car unless you are stepping on the brake when the driver turns on the ignition and it rings a bell as a reminder to step on the brake before the car can start.

The car also warns if a door is ajar when traveling and if the brake is partially on. 

Parking brake is foot activated and released: The harder you step when locking the harder the parking brake will hold.  It's Ok but car still lurches forward after the parking brake is engaged hard and the column is in park position.

Rear seats are capable of spliting into one down and one up for hauling larger things.  With both rear seats folded down, this vehicle can load very large objects if necessary. 

Runs well on regular unleaded gasoline, providing about 17 mpg. Passengers sit high in comparison to sedan type vehicles giving the driver et al a good over view of the road and traffic  conditions.  Very little cabin noise even at the high speed of 85 mph.  Gas tank holds 19 gallons, in  comparison the year 2000 RX-300 holds 17 gallons.
 
Full time all wheel drive makes this car stick to the road in torrential downpours and greatly improves driver  confidence. Have never felt tire slippage at any time.

Wide turning radius makes manuvering very difficult at times even with power steering.  Rear trunk space is not very large, related to (r/t) spare tire that is inside the rear trunk.  Cargo cover does hide contents well.  

Daytime running lights make the car much more visible and really helps at night as cars see this car well even though the driver has not activated the headlights. At nignt time  the interior and exterior mirrors automatically dim on this sample.  It activates to on as a defalt and needs to be turned off if an unfamiliar driver takes the wheel and should be disabled when changing lanes at night in heavy freeway traffic as it can reduce visibility enough to increase the chance of an accidnet .

Large windows all around.  The Front window tends to flare with strong sunlight reducing visibility for the driver's right lower corner. This makes it much easier to colide with a parked car or pedestrian as well. The glass all-around has a golden reflective tint that makes it difficult for pedestrians to casually glance into the vehicle and see the contents inside.  

Drive column has an overdrive off button on it 

Wonderful glove box but only slightly bigger than a pair of gloves.

Cup holders have weak adjustment wings and console top popup cup holder is very weak altogether.  Both need to be redesigned.  The cup holder inside the top drawer of the console is removable, so perhaps a better one will plug in at a future date.

Dealership delivered the vehicle to the owners home in perfect condition. On Friday the 13th no-less.  GET-OUT!  This is a true story. 

Car paint job is extaordinary with metal flake highlights in this example's pearl white paint.

Aerodynamic look and feel to this car. 
Great as a people mover.  Elderly people enter and exit easily related to 4 door construction and high seats. Most people can just sit down and the swing in their legs to load and reverse the procedure to exit.  Good leg room front and back noted.  Vehicle seats 5 adults very comfortably with nice headroom and visibility.  
Driver can lock out all windows and doors to childproof them.

Fuel cover releases from pull up lever only at the backleft of the driver's foot carpet.
Trunk lid is hinged on top a-la lift back style and spring loaded.  Watch those ceiling mounted pipes in subterranium garages, it can hit them hard and also catch on them as well if you drive with the trunk lid up.

Customer service is very concerned that the owners are satisfied and delighted with their product.  You get top notch support and care for these finely built and durable machines.  Warranty is longer than most and comprehensive but I would have to look them up.  Just keep changing the oil every three thousand miles and the car should be driveable untill the wheels fall off.
