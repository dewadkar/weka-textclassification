                 In the 14 months since leasing a 1999 BMW M roadster, I have yet to be disappointed.  The M has been pleasing in every way: it still catches my eye, it still inspires me with its performance, and it impresses me with its reliability.  BMW has taken its Z3 droptop and given its famed BMW Motorsport (hence, the &quot;M&quot;) free rein with the engine, drivetrain, brakes and wheels, and seats.  The result is a breathtaking combination of handling and performance that will not fail your expectations.
     To be honest, I was never a big fan of BMW automobiles in the past.  They always seem to offer less interior space for a hefty price when compared to other cars.  When shopping for a Porsche Boxster, a friend suggested I drive the M roadster to compare.  I found the BMW to offer more standard features, better performance, and a program where all scheduled maintenance is included in the lease.  All of this and $10,000 cheaper!  How could I say no?  As far as space, who drives a 2 seat convertible to help your friends move?
     Fourteen months later, I am very happy about my decision.  The M roadster has been very dependable, with one minor speaker problem covered under warranty and replaced within 10 days by my local dealer.  The one thing I wish the car had: a passenger side airbag turnoff switch.  The first car magazine test I read had one in it, but now BMW says they do not offer one.  Oh well, I guess every car can't be perfect!<br><br>
