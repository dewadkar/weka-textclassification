            Less than a month after we bought our 1998 Dodge Ram 4x4 extended cab brand new from the dealer, we had to bring it in to have the engine completely replaced.  We noticed a strange noise coming from the motor so we took it in to have it checked and found that it was about to throw a rod.  Despite this, Dodge was very cooperative with getting this fixed and we demanded that they give us the 100,000 mile extended warranty, free of charge.  They obliged, and we've had no problems since.

We love our Dodge truck.  It is very roomy, and certainly is not lacking of power.  One thing we enjoy is that despite it's enormous size (and I do mean big), it has excellent acceleration for a truck, and the ride is very comfortable.  Gas mileage is so-so, but when you consider the size and weight of the truck, it's acceptable.

Besides the wind noise when traveling down the highway or interstate, my biggest complaint is the way that the stereo is configured.  Instead of having fader and balance knobs, the stereo has a little joystick-like control, which is too easy bumped and very difficult to get perfectly centered.

All in all, this is a very well-made, solid truck.  We were a bit scared at first because of the issues with the engine, but since then it has proven to be very reliable.<br><br>
