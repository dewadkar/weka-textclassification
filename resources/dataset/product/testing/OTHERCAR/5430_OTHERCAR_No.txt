               <b>Ok so maybe my title is a little overboard</b>, but seriously this car's acceleration is very disappointing. The prototype of the Prowler drew crowds at all auto shows in 1993-1996. Much like new Nissan 250Z more than an estimated 50,000 buyers put down their orders before a single car went on sale in late 1996.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

    <b>I</b>t's not hard to grin when you drive the Plymouth Prowler for the very first time, you know you are in a cool looking car, and a car that is admired by almost anyone who gets a good glance. Unfortunately the engineers at Chrysler must have been on medication the day they decided to build the powertrain for the Plymouth Prowler. Instead of using a traditional tire burning V8 that would have went with the whole hot rod theme, Chrysler used a V6 engine that would have been better left in a family sedan. On to some positive notes; the front wishbone <b>suspension</b> works as good as it looks, and there are 20 inch rear tires that give the rear end the right 'hot rod' look. There is no V8, but the look, the feel, and the 'almost V8 like sound' is pure bred American fun. If you buy a Prowler be prepared to be the center of attention at every 'hot car nite.' They may be booing you for buying a car with family car horsepower, but honestly we all would like to have one of these, whether we admit it or not. I have a feeling people would have still bought this car even if it came with the Dodge Neon's base 2.0 SOHC 132 horse power engine.
 
      <b>W</b>ith apparently no suitable V8 still in production (personally I think Chrysler should have used the Viper's V10) Chrysler uses their 3.5-liter V6 found in cars like the Dodge Intreped R/T, and the Chrysler 300M. Its alloy heads have four valves per cylinder, operated by a single overhead camshaft per bank of cylinders via hydraulic lifters. The engine is fed by electronic fuel injection, a far cry from the side-valve engines of the first hot rods. The maximum power is just an adequate 253 bhp for 1997, produced at 5,800 RPM. Its cam profile is designed to give quick throttle response, but 0-60 in the mid 7 second range isn't too quick sounding to me, at least for a car with such a high price and hot rod looks.

      <b>T</b>he first Prowler's frame was produced by Indianapolis race car builders in all aluminum. Chrysler knew this car would not have very much power so they needed to save weight wherever possible. Because the car sits so high in the back, it makes sense to package the switchable semi/fully four speed automatic transmission at the rear, using an alloy propshaft to join engine to box. That means that the engine can be set well back under the hood to allow that sleek nose. This layout also makes for better weight distribution and better handling.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> is surprisingly luxurious, rich black leather, a 'super' thick, leather wrapped steering wheel, decent sound system, plenty of room for a 2 seater. The seats are very comfortable, and despite looking like a car that is hard to drive, this car on the contrary is very easy thanks to its super easy ergonomics, easy to operate transmission and modest power delivery. The plastics in the cabin are of good quality, Chrysler did not skimp out using cheap plastics as they did with many of their cars in the past.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

    The <b>exterior</b>, as you all probably know, looks very much like a hot rod. The prowler is meant to be enjoyed with the top down, but it even looks more stylish with the top in place. It's very low, which emphasizes the larger rear trunk and gives the car a more custom made look. The '97 Prowler comes with dual exhaust with big chrome tail pipes, an exposed front bumper, a retro styled grille and ellipsoid lights. you can even buy a little purple trailer which makes you look even more 'ultra cool' when extra luggage capacity is needed.

<i>Pricing:</i> 

  The <b>price</b> for these cars new in 1997 were around $40,000. Today a '97 will set you back around around $30,000. These cars have very good resale value, only around 5,000 were built in 1997 so it has exclusivity on its side. 

 <i>Conclusion:</i> 

The Plymouth Prowler is much more of daily driver which couples as a show car vs an actual hot rod. the price is a bit high here, even today these cars are in the upper 30K range. If you are looking for these type of attributes from a car then the Prowler is recommended, otherwise I suggest looking elsewhere. One also should note that the later Chrysler badged models boast even more power, and more appeal.
