            I've had this car since it had 40k miles on it.  Since then I have put so much work into it that I cant remember half the things I had to fix.  First off, the interior panels and upholstery are sh*t.  If you get the material seats be prepared to have them dirty as hell in an hour or two, literally, i had the white seats with pin stripes and just after shampooing they where dirty in hours.  The front panels and door panels, although screwed tight, still rattle and squeeeek.  The dashboard shakes like a jalopie when you hit a pot hole, and dont forget to check the rear view mirror to see if your tire didnt fall off.

After owning this car for some time i've had to replace the following,

Side moldings, 3 times already!
Alternator
Rims (cheap sh*t)
Exhaust system, including catalytic converter and muffler
Air condition compressor,
Belts,
Belt pulleys,
Battery
Starter, about 3 times!
Battery cable
Frame straightening, Car pulled to left due to bent frame??!! CHEAP SH*T!
Brake master cylinder, 
Brake rear calipers, both, every time i changed breaks,
Thermostat, overheating
Motor Mounts


I have more blood on my hands from working on this cheap car than any other machine i've worked with.  The german engineering is so stupid that you would think they put the engine in so that you can work on it, but NO, you have to break your arm in 3 places just to get to a simple screw.
All I can say is that i'm happy that this car doesnt need to be plugged into a computer, but when you have to work on this machine it will make you want to take a sledge hammer to it.

I've added so much time and money to this car that it has 150k miles on it now and runs like a charm.  I added a low temp thermostat and Neuspeed lowering springs as well as 17in rims with touring tires.  I made this machine for travelling long distances.  Even increaded the timing so that at high rpm i get more power at higher gas mileage.  The engine runs fine now after I regularly had to replace a whole lot of junk.  My current problem is that the steering wheel rattles like crazy if I go over 45 mph, I bet its the steering column since even the mechanic says the ball joints are good. 

Thats another problem with this VW, you dont know what the hell is wrong with it and you wind up replacing 20 different things before you get to the actual problem.  This car is a peice of SH*T, but i've added so much to it that I love it.
