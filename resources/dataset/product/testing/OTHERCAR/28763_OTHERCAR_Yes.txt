            I've had my '98 Honda Prelude for almost three years now and I couldn't be happier with this car's performance.  It's great on gas mileage, and it costs less than $15 to fill the tank.  This car has given me the bare minimum of problems in 3 years:  about 6 months ago, for the first time, I noticed a tiny problem.  Whenever I'd come to a stop and then drive again, I could hear a knock in the front somewhere, nothing major; but within a month I received notification from Honda that that make and model had a problem with the ball bearings, and they fixed it for free within a week after I received their card.  Other than that, NOTHING has gone wrong with this vehicle.  And most importantly of all--this car has FANTASTIC PICKUP! ;)

The heat kicks in quickly on cold winter mornings, and the car is only a teensy bit sluggish when the air conditioning is on.  Since '98, the Prelude does not come with a cassette player--there is a one-disc CD player instead.  I find this to be quite superior to having a CD changer in the trunk, first because you can easily change CDs while you're driving, and also because the CD player hardly EVER skips the way that it does in cars where the player is located in the trunk.

There is lots of room within the car for storing your things:  2 cup holders, a spot for CDs under the CD player, a change holder, nice-sized glove compartment, pocket in back of one of the seats.  One complaint--this car can feel VERY small, and sitting in the backseat is uncomfortable even for one person.  If you're used to a four-door, you probably will feel cramped in the Prelude, so I'd suggest the Accord.  Either way, you can't go wrong with a Honda; I doubt you'll find another car that's as reliable and stress-free.<br><br>
