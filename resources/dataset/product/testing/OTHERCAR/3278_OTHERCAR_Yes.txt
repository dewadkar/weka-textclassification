            I have driven nothing but Nissans for twenty-seven years, and even wrote an epinion for the Pathfinder.

My lease was coming up on my 1999 Pathfinder and I was thinking of a Maxima.  I read all the reports on the Camry, Accord, and Maxima and decided I would "just look" at the other two before leasing the Maxima.

On the way to the Nissan dealer, we stopped at Toyota.  I was looking at the Camrys and turned around and saw this sporty car in the next row.  I said "WHAT is that?'.  It was the Solara.  I looked at it, sat in it - then drove it.  The handling was very good at high speeds.  We put it through the tests - went to an empty lot and got it up to 80 then slammed on brakes - the slide was absolutely straight! Perfectly controlled.

The Solara was quieter that the Camry we test drove.  I love my Solara!  I am 5' tall and a little overweight, but the seat adjusts perfectly for me - though I have a slight problem with the seatbelt being high on my neck (a problem in almost any car for me at 5').  My husband is 6'3 and the Solara seat adjusts perfectly for him also.  He has plenty of head room and leg room in the front.  He can even sit okay in the back if he sits behind me (okay, so I am short).

The 4 cylinder engine (have never had a 4 before) seems strong and will get up and go when I have asked it to.  

My friend drives nothing by Lexus.  She got in and immediately said "this interior looks just like my Lexus".  The quality and reliability of Toyota and the looks of a Lexus - what more can you ask?

This Solara is my first car that was not Nissan in 27 years and I think I will keep this one a long time!
