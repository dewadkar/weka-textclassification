            Picked it up early Nov after a custom order (white is not a standard colour for the coupe, extra $1000 for the paint job). I bought this car since I used to own an 85 white XJ-S coupe with the V12. That car had some troubles but the experience of owning it was still positive and I like the way Jag coupes look. Thus as things worked out, it became possible for me to get a new 2001 XK8. I thought about the XKR that everyone raves about but frankly, a 12-18month wait, no roads here that allow that kind of power to be unleashed (northern California), let me save ~10k$ and get the car that much sooner. A typical custom order takes 90days (assuming they have not sold all the body shells and you need something special (like a different paint job)).

Loves:
-- Performance. Powerful engine married to a very good ZF transmission        makes a lot of options open up as you drive (easy merges, passing etc).
-- Handling. This ~4000lb car is managed very well via precise control        from the speed sensitive steering and 4wheel disk brakes. It is            surprisingly agile and can take corners at speeds I would not have         considered in my XJ-S
-- Looks. Wow. 2001 adds a few visual cues that are nice, some chrome         added in various places (like around the tail lights). The basic shape
   is that gorgeous swoopy curvy sexy body. You either fall in love with
   it or naysayers typically go on a Taurus rant. Of course I think the
   white onyx paint is far superior to the other colours they offer :)
-- Toys. New in 2001 is a parktronic system on the rear bumper. Beeps         faster until it is a solid tone indicating ~8&quot; from an obstacle.
   The alpine 320 watt stereo is awesome. The clarity and power of this
   system will make you slackjawed.
-- Accoutrements. Leather, wood. Fine leather abounds, well prepared wood
   on the dash. This is what classic British creature comfort is all          about. 2001 adds new seats with built in side airbags and power            headrests. Also the passenger seat has more adjustments now.
-- Safety. Side airbags in 2001 + the 3stage passenger airbag (full power,    low weight occupant, off) makes for a safe cabin. Traction control and     ABS+ round out the safety features. (I have not used TC or ABS yet).

Hates:
-- A/B mileage clear/set review is fiddly and confusing.
-- Auto-wipers can come on late (after startup in the rain), and can
   come on out of the blue for a single wipe in stark sunshine.
-- The guy that flicked a stone up on 101 at me and pitted my windshield.
   when the car was 1week old.
-- Gas mileage on the Mulroney is optimistic 24hwy? at 65-70 I get ~20-21.
   Around town it is ~14-18. (Mulroney 17).
