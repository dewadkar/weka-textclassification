            The Nikon CoolPix 950 is a modern marvel.  With most digital cameras providing the look and feel, and probably the picture quality, of a toy, the CP 950 feels like a Nikon, looks like a Nikon, and delivers the pictures I expect to get from a Nikon camera.
While digital photography hasn't reached the levels of 35mm or better, the 950 comes close.  The slight difference is easy to forget when the pictures are quickly and easily transferred to my computer, exposure and compositon errors can be instantly corrected, and the pictures can be available on the internet within minutes or hours at most to be shared with friends and family anywhere they have a computer.
I chose Nikon because I've been using their products since the 70's and know they make a solid, reliable product with superior optics.  I have not been disappointed.  Anyone who wants a flexible, sturdy camera with superior optics and potential to match their own should seriously consider the Nikon CoolPix 950.
What I miss most is the speed of a mechanical shutter that takes the picture when the button is pushed.<br><br>
