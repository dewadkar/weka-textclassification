            Saab has created a very well appointed, technologically advanced car for the money in the 9-5. A very comparable BMW 528 or Audi A6 is thousands more.  If it were only reliable! In 25K mi, I have had it into the dealer more than 10 times for UNscheduled maintenance.  Water pump, SRS sensor, thermostat, major coolant leak, dead battery, failed trip computer and clock LED.  If you need a part, it's usually 3-4 days waiting just to get it from the Saab warehouse.  

Just goto www.Saabnet.com and look at the 9-5 bulletin board if you want to see the widespread problems that lots of people are having.  Maybe the 2000's are more reliable, but I would NOT recommend the 1999.  My experience re: reliability has been horrible.  On the plus side, every time my car has broken down, SAAB customer assistance has been very helpful and generous.  But still, for a $30,000+ car, it is way too unreliable. <br><br>
