            My wife and I purchased this car after trading a '95 Passat Wagon( The VW was supposed to be our nice, paid-for Home Depot capable vehicle).  Unfortunately, the Passat didn't work out for a variety of reasons (5-speed, electrical snafus, etc).  We are both very happy with the purchase.  After putting 2k miles on it in the first month, I can state that this car is very road-worthy and a pleasure to drive.  The light-touch turbo supplies all the in town power one should need.  The wide-open throttle is not as impressive as the Passat 2.8l V-6; however, the quickness is more  desirable than the high-rev power.
My first Volvo was a '72 wagon that could haul everything I owned in college but couldn't get out of its own way(4cyl, auto trans).  It DID respond faithfully when lifted off the ground during a tornado!  The 2nd model was a '80 GT.  Also somewhat under-powered but super solid in all road conditions.  Went broke trying to maintain it by the book after the warranty expired.
The newest generation of Volvos looks very promising...great fit and finish, responsive engines and a much longer warranty (roughly double that of VW's standard warranty...could explain Volvos claim that former Passat drivers are some of their best customers).
I would echo the disappointment mentioned by another reviewer re: standard vs optional equipment... The CD upgrade is quite expensive considering the stereo performance.  The leather upgrade is very pricey for the small amount of leather surfacing.  We opted for the stereo/leather combo upgrade for $1800...still high even with the &quot;discount&quot; for the package.
One not-so-minor consideration is the WAY high insurance premiums which have always been associated with this type of &quot;safe&quot; car.  Volvos, Saabs and many other passenger safe cars crumple to absorb impact and protect passengers.  Unfortunately, this results in greater repair costs and higher premiums.
Re: driving impressions...At 5'11&quot;, I drive with the seat fully rearward.  This would cut into rear seat comfort (not usually a problem for us.  Our other car is a Miata...we're happy to HAVE a rear seat) and could present difficulties for taller drivers.  The Passat had a good bit more front leg room.  The light-touch turbo cuts in quickly enough to break the front wheels loose in turns or on any slick pavement (parents, this may NOT be the best Volvo for your kids) and provides plenty of pick-up under all but the most demanding conditions.  It is effortless ( somewhat surprisingly easy) to reach 100mph.  Welcome to Atlanta! The mileage was rated at 22/32, higher than the 2000 model (5spd auto vs 4spd).  Our highway average was 28ish @ 78-80 mph average.  Our less-spirited in-town average is 21-22mpg.  Back seat room is limited, but, we plan to use the fold-down seats to expand the cargo capacity more often than we will carry rear-seat passengers.  We considered the wagon(V40) but couldn't justify $1000 extra just for the wagon body.  I would highly recommend the S40 for anyone considering a Maxima, G20 or Passat.  You pay a little more for the safety record, but, $25k for a well-appointed vehicle isn't uncommon any more.  By-the-by, we purchased our 2001 in October @ $200 over invoice, no hassles.  Volvo has a significant dealer holdback that makes purchasing (in Atlanta area, anyway) almost fun!<br><br>
