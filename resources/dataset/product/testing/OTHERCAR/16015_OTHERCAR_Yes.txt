            This is my 4th Toyota and 3rd Camry. That says it all. These are the best cars on the road. The Japanese won hands down. I have 4 cyl for better gas milage and this car may be no speed demon but why do I need my insurance rates higher! 
Comfort, reliable, great cup holders, a cd. What more do I need. Oh and the trunk is huge! And the ride is so quiet. I have basic CE. Why pay for extras. It will just bring up the price. I love my Camry and cant say enough good stuff.
And driving this car is a pleasure. As I said the ride is smooth. I hear very little engine noise or road noise. The care is roomy enough for 5. It is very well laid out. Better in many ways than my Mercedes 320ML!
Just put the key in and go.
