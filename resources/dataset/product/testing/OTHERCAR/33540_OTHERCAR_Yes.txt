            Although I often have to suffer through occasional comments that a VW NB is a "chick car" or a "gay man's car" (I thought that title belonged to the Miata), I think it's a spectacular commuter car and a general blast to drive. It has decent acceleration (esp. between 3500-5000 RPM; if you want more, you want a turbo or an RSi V6), gets good fuel mileage (28-30 mpg, depending on how hard I push it), and it tracks and turns very flat and true, much like my old 944. It also has lots of front-seat leg and headroom, and the Monsoon stereo can make one's ears bleed. :)

Nits are the smallish glovebox, finicky auto-up/auto-down window controls, poorly laid out cupholders (suggestion to VW: Put the handbrake outboard, and the cupholders between the seats), and especially the lack of an in-dash CD player (there is a spot for a trunk-mounted CD changer, but the dash has a cassette deck. Who has cassettes anymore??). One other small annoyance is the A/C power and recirc buttons, which do not dim with the rest of the dash lights, and are neither red nor indigo).

I wouldn't recommend it for family use (unless the kids are on the small side and 2 or less in number). Loading it up slows it down considerably (as does firing up the A/C), and there's not a great deal of stowage space.

However, for one or two people, it's a comfortable car. And for a long commute on winding backroads, it's great!
