            [ Please note, from talking to other people, the problems here also apply to the 2002, 2003, 2004 models ]

I bought my 2001 Mazda Tribute LX shortly after they were first released. I did not want leather seats, so I went with the LX 4WD instead of the EX.  Price paid was sticker, but at least I got a little bit of a deal on my old trade-in.

At first I absolutely loved the little SUV.  Handling was superb, and it looked really nice.  However, after the honeymoon period ended, I started having lots of little problems and one very big problem.

<b>Design Problems</b>

The Tribute has more wind noise than any other truck or van I have ever been in.  You can't hear the person next to you unless they shout or the radio unless you turn it way up.

The shift lever was in a really bad spot.  You couldn't see the radio because the lever was in the way, and you would always knock it when changing stations or CDs.

<b>Fit and Finish Problems</b>

There was a plastic rivet missing from the plastic around the bottom of the door.  Because that was missing, the inside step-plate kept popping off and falling outside the car if someone kicked it on the way in.  Over the course of several months, the dealer tried several times but could never get me the correct plastic rivet.  Eventually I got a box in the mail that promised to have the correct rivet.  Nope, instead it had about 20 undersized black rivets as used in another Mazda Vehicle.  I gave up and put one of those in.  It didn't look right, and didn't fit well, but it kept the plastic piece in place.

Some of the plastic around the inside of the rear hatch started to lift and separate - the plastic actually warped.  The dealer could not do anything about this without keeping my vehicle for several days.  They also said that plastic part was next to impossible to get.

Later on, the headliner (the interior top) started to fall down.  It turns out that the glue was defective.  This was a very common problem with the tributes.  They took my car for a couple days and replaced the headliner - a large project.

<b>Gas Smell and Gas Mileage Problems</b>

The SUV had a bit of a gas smell problem.  The dealer told me this was normal and it would go away.  I questioned that, but they stood by that comment.  The smell never really went away - if the car sat with the windows closed for a day or two, you could definitely smell it on the inside.

Later on, I learned that this was another common Mazda Tribute problem.  The gas mileage gets worse over time (I noticed that, but thought it was all in my head _ I was getting mileage in the 13-17mpg range) because of some sort of a leak in the line. I didn't quite understand that (there was no gas on the ground), but it was a real problem.  There are numerous complaints about this on the NHTSA Site ( http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/complaintsearch.cfm ).

The vehicle also received numerous recalls in the year I had it.  These ranged from wipers that might fly off, to significant problems with brakes and steering.  It was always in the shop for one thing or another.

<b>Stalling - The Big Problem</b>

One day, as I was approaching the end of the 36,000 mile warrantee, my wife and I were driving down a side road to get to a store.  As we rounded a corner at about 35/40 miles an hour, the engine stalled and everything shut down.  I lost power steering, brakes, everything.  I had to use the emergency brake to stop the car as I slid into a ditch and raised earth on the side of the road.  Scared us both!  After a minute, I was able to start the car back up, but we were both extremely nervous.

We turned around and went home.  Immediately we called the dealer.  They told us to bring it in for service the next day.  My wife brought it in for service the next day while I was at work with her car.  She called me and told me that they said there wasn't anything they could do to fix it, but just to be able to diagnose the problem they would have to replace the computer with a new one.  After that, they would be able to adjust the idle timing.  They said that would make it use more gas, and idle a lot higher.  When asked if that would fix the problem, my wife was told "Well, it's a Tribute" in a "not with this piece of junk" tone of voice.  And that was coming from the service department at a Mazda dealership!

In the meantime, I searched the net for similar complaints.  I stumbled on the jackpot at the NHTSA Site ( http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/complaintsearch.cfm ).  There are literally hundreds of similar complaints against the Tribute and its twin the Ford Escape. From talking to other people, it appears that no solution has been found, no recalls issued etc.

In the end, before the new computer could be installed (it would take weeks to get one in), I traded it in and got a 2002 Honda CRV.  While it doesn't have the acceleration, height or handling of the Tribute, it also has not had a single fit/finish or mechanical problem and gets twice the gas mileage I was getting in my Tribute.
