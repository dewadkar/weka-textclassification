            This vehicle the E 320 sedan i have stalls when going over bumps.
I have 2 small children,, and it stalls out of drives and on railroad tracks. I have had it in 5 times for repairs with no luck. I hope to God we do not get killed, and to top it all off Mercedes has accused me of being a liar. 

This is a documented problem with this vehicle already registered with NHTSA. 

I have requested a replacement vehicle since this one cant be fixed, but has been denied.

This problem seems to be found in many E 320 vehicles, and i hope they can find out what is causing the problem.

If anyone knows, i would appreciate finding out. I leased the vehicle, and have 3 more years left. God only knows i dont want to wonder if every road bump will stall the vehicle. This is not good.

If you can help it would be appreciated, for the sake and safety of my family..

Thanks very much<br><br>
