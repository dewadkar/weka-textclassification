            My dad has had his Passat for about 7 years now. He is still very happy with it.
He has the Diesel version which gives him an awesome gas mileage around 50 mpg on the freeway. The ride is very smooth with very direct steering.
The only problem he ever had was when he was traveling on the freeway at about 70 mph, the brakes quit working altogether. Since his Passat is a standard, he used the engine to slow down. Luckily, the road was pretty empty so he managed to come to a stop without any damage. What had happened was that the material on the inside of the hood had come loose in several smaller pieces. It must have fallen on the exhaust manifold or some other hot part and had caught fire. One of these burning pieces must have set a hose on the brake system on fire and cause it to completely fail.
This really happened, I had trouble believing it myself, especially since this car has always been very reliable.
The Diesel engine gets a bit noisy at higher speeds but it accelerates the car up to 115 mph at only 75 horsepower. Even at those higher speeds, the as mileage is still great.
The car is very comfortable, even tall passengers have plenty of space in the back seats. Everything seems to be built with the idea in mind to make it tough and long lasting.
One big drawback to VW's in general is the high cost for replacement parts.
I strongly recommend a Passat to everyone who wants a well built, comfortable and economic car and is willing to pay a little more for the quality.
