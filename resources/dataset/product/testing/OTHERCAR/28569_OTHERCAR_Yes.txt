                The Jeep Wrangler was my first new vehicle, purchased just before Thanksgiving 1999.  I love mine, but there are some important things to consider before purchasing a Wrangler.  If my review seems to focus on the negative aspects, it is only because I have heard too many stories of people running out and buying Wranglers, only to hate them after a month.  We all know the reasons for buying a Wrangler, so I will try to focus on who isn't suited to drive a Wrangler.

    First of all, the Wrangler IS NOT a passenger car, and shouldn't judged as such.  Remember, the Jeep was developed over 60 years ago as a wartime vehicle, and no other vehicle on the road has evolved less than the Wrangler.  However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The ride is stiff compared to other cars and trucks, but the amazing traction and ground clearance is the positive result.  The interior offers little in the way of creature comforts (although much more than Jeeps of yesteryear).  All of the interior is either waterproof of easily removable, so clean-up can be done with a hose after a weekend of four-wheeling in the mud.  Gas mileage isn't great, even in the 4-cylinder due to the low gearing - don't expect to get 30+ MPG like a Japanese car just because its a 4-cylinder.  Virtually everything on a Wrangler is an option - including carpet, steel doors, and rear seat.  Jeeps are convertibles and have little or no insulation, so they are quite loud, especially on the highway.  If at all possible, get the Sport or Sahara model - the 4-cylinder engine (which I have) is A DOG.  However, the Jeep isn't built for speed.  The 4-cylinder engine would be useless after a suspension lift and larger tires were added - popular modifications for Jeep enthusists.  The upside is that there is an almost endless supply of aftermarket accessories for Jeeps.

    There is a reason you mostly see twenty-somethings driving Wranglers - they simply aren't practical.  They are convertibles and cannot seat 4 people comfortably.  They have no room for cargo without removing the rear seat, and they are easily broken into.  If you are shopping for a primary family vehicle, the Wrangler is not it.

    All of the above being said, the Jeep excels at its original and primary function - it is indestrucible and will go over almost anything.  it is the most capable 4-wheel drive vehicle made, with the possible exception of a $80,000.00 Humvee.  It is built on a solid steel frame and is as sturdy as a tank.  I have no fear of the elements or road conditions when driving my Wrangler - 18 inches of snow that would cripple passenger cars doesn't keep me in my house in the winter, even before the roads are plowed.

   The other main advantage of the Wrangler is that it holds it retail value tremendously - I have seen 10 - 15 year old Jeeps frequently go for $5,000.00 or more.  This is also an advantage when leasing - I was able to get the Wrangler for less on a lease than substantially cheaper vehicles (Saturn SL, Ford Focus) simply because you are only financing the depreciation.

    Overall, if the Wrangler suits your lifestyle, or you are looking for a second vehicle, the Wrangler is one of the most capable and fun vehicles you will ever drive.<br><br>
