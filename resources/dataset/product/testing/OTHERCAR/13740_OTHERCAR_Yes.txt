            We bought a used 1996 Subaru Impreza with 24,000 miles on it.

We live on a dirt road in the country,
and we need 4-wheel drive to make it up a steep hill.  The Impreza handles
beautifully in the snow and ice.  One thing we like is that it is a very basic car with manual windows, seat adjustments, etc.  There is not much on it to break.  We have 70,000 miles on it and have never needed any repairs.  With some cars we have owned we were nickle and dimed to death. It seemed like something was always breaking.

The main drawback of this car is comfort.  It is fine for running around town, but if you take a long trip of several hours, it becomes quite uncomfortable.  My son is 6'3&quot; tall, and he finds it too small.  He has to recline his seat back to keep his head from hitting the roof.

We are very happy with our car.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs good reliable and inexpensive transportation, who is not planning to take lots of long road trips.<br><br>
