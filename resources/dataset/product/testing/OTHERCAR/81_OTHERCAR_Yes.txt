            If you have ever dreamed of splurging on a sexy, sleek little topless number for yourself, then do it!  The Miata will fulfill your every dream and more.  You can have one with supple leather and cold a/c if you need it, and every  one comes with a light weight vinyl top that can be down in about 15 seconds.
But the best part of all is that this baby is reliable.  Her curvacious lines were inspired  from early British  sports cars that were not too dependable.  But her lineage ends there.  She will always start and be waiting for you.  
Insurance will be very affordable.  And trips to the dealer for maintenance will not break the bank.  You will be smiling from ear to ear not only from the go-cart like ride, but also from how much money you are saving over purchasers of BMW Z3's and Porsche Boxters and the like.  She may not have the power of a 'Vette, but she will still turn heads and hang in the curves with the very best.

I bought my first one new in 1992.  I bought another in 1998.  I may buy another.  You can usually find very good used ones in the price range of $7,000 to $12,000 up through about the 95 model year.  New ones start at around $19,000.  You should not be afraid to pocket some change and pick up a nice used one if you have it checked by a good mechanic.  These cars really age well, and have a history of rewarding their owners with many trouble free miles.

The Miata has a devout club, The Miata Club of America, and is at 25,000 strong.  You will be able to find  active online groups of Miataphiles to share with and get  support  from.  And those into racing will be very happy with the Miata's performance either in stock form or with some minor modifications.  The Miata holds many national titles in SCCA and other racing forums.
