            I purchased my 1992 Dodge Caravan 4 years ago.  I had always wanted a minivan, and after looking at several, I liked the look of the Caravan the best. I had 2 kids at the time, and was thinking about having another 1.

Now I have 3 girls and thank God for my minivan.  There is alot of room to fit the kids.  There is also enough room in the back to put all my purchases.  It is easy to get my baby in and out of her carseat and the carseat fits nicely into the seat.My oldest likes to take friends everywhere we go and now I can do that.  

Because of the short front end on it, it makes parking a breeze.  I was never much for parallel parking, but with my minivan I can do it.  It also gets pretty decent gas mileage.  I get 20 miles to the gallon on short runs and 23 on trips.

It has great power, and being from a state with alot of hills, it makes them with ease.I really enjoy my minivan and hope it is around along time. I purchased it used, and it now has about 90,000 miles and no problems so far.  Hopefully, I will get another 90,000 out of it!<br><br>
