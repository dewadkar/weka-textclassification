             Being a nascar fan, I'm biased towards the Monte Carlo. I purchased a 1999 Z34 six months ago. The exterior aerodynamic contour body is a cross between a sporty appearance but somehow strikes the driver as an average body design. So if your the family type but want the earnhardt, (famous nascar racer), to come out in you while driving this is your car to own. 
 The interior is moderately roomy with sufficient leg and head room. The seats are comfortably contoured to snug you into the seat. Naturally leather, with power adjustments. The steering wheel is leather with a thick padded feel. Stereo controls are geniously placed in the steering wheel to maximize eyes on road driving. The dashboard has a sporty look with large numeric speedometer/tachomter clusters.  Easy to reach Power doors/locks/windows, etc. 
 The engine is a 3.8 V-6.  No problems with this engine. It's quiet and smooth with power that commands respect. A lot of mechanic friends of mine say that chevy engines, when properly serviced run forever. 
 The handling is absolutely fantastic. You can feel the road. It's steering is solid and precise. I already had to panic steer out of a near collision. the car responded and went were I wanted it to go. 
 The ride has a comfortable feel. Shocks are adequate with no excessive movement. The brakes are way too small for this car. The brakes are wearing down and I will have to get them replaced soon.
