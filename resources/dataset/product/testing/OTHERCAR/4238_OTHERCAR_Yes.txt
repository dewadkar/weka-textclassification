            I have wanted to test drive an Aztek since I saw them arrive at a local dealer.  I looked at a 2001 Aztek once, but was afraid it was just a bit too funky for me.  That all changed when I saw the 2002 Aztek!  I loved the refined looks and seemed just a bit more sporty, but I still wasn't sure it was for me.  I drove everything that interested me under $30,000 and still was not quite satisfied.  I became more curious about the Aztek.  Then I saw the commercial for GM's 0% Financing.  I thought now would be the best time!  We also have a 2002 Chevy Avalanche.  That was a bit funky too when it first came out.  I checked out GMBuyPower.com to find out which dealer had the best selection.  I was lucky to find a dealer that was low pressure and interested in what is right for me.  

The only loaded Aztek was in Yellow, but I liked it anyway. I loved the leather, sunroof and heads up display.  This thing was loaded!  Then I took it for a test drive.  I loved the way it handled.  The power was much better than I had heard about.  The seating is very comfortable with a great ride height.  Visibility is good.  (The rear spoiler takes some getting used to.)  By the end of the drive I was totally digging this vehicle.  I was actually surprised how well I liked it!  It had everything many luxury cars/suvs have, but for thousands less. But, was it really for me?  The dealer even told me that it's not a car for everyone, but you will know if it's right for you.  

I went home and looked up as much as I could about the Aztek.  I even printed out the pricing on Edmunds.com.  I thought it over for a couple of days and couldn't wait to drive it again.   After driving quite a few more cars I realized that the Yellow Aztek was for me.  I could have tried to get a dealer transfer from another state, but I didn't want to chance it sight unseen.  Anyway, I thought why not go with the yellow?  If you are going to get an unusual automobile, why not go all the way!  

The dealer came within $300 of Edmunds.com pricing.  I opted not to take the $3000 Cash Back and get the 0% Financing from GMAC.  I also opted for the extended warranty.  It couldn't have been easier or faster!  In about an hour I was out the door.  I picked up my Aztek the following day.  The entire experience was amazing.  I couldn't have been treated any better. 

I have only had my Aztek for three days, but it makes me smile every time I look at it.  I love the heads up display and the 10 speaker stereo rocks!  It is the quietest car I have ever owned.  The yellow does grow on you and the styling itself is just different than anything else out there.  I have already been approached twice by people who wanted to know what it was!  Not to mention the people slowing down on the highway to check it out!
