            This digital camera, even though being the cheepest of the five, is very easy to use and has great quality.  It has many features including zooms, panorama, and multi.  Zoom lets you zoom in close to what you are taking a picture of without getting blurry or you having to worry about focusing.  Panorama gives you a wider shot to let you get in those spread out pictures.  Multi is a great function for all of those extreme sports guys.  You can one picture but the camera will take 9 shots.  This allows someone to be moving and not having to take the picture at the perfect time.  You can get the one picture you like most and cut it out using the program that comes with the camera.  Also, you can change the quality of the pictures.  
       For all of the skaters out there I would definatly recommend this camera.  I use the multi function and get sequenced shots and edit them to make great gif files.  You can easily take the pictures and then put them on web pages also.<br><br>
