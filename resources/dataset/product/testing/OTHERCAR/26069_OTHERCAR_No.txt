            This car is for the person just starting out.  If it's luxury you want, don't consider buying this car.  It gets good gas mileage and the price is affordable, but if you live where you have a lot of hills and dales then look for something else that will keep it's speed on those hills and that can make the time pass.
I took a two hour drive that felt more like 4 hours because it seemed to take so long getting over the mountains.  I thought I would never get to my destination!
I had to stop a couple of times to stretch my legs and get some fresh air.  I lost reception in the mountains and was unable to play my radio.  It does have a CD so that's a good option to have when all else fails.
