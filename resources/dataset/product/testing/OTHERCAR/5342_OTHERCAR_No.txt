            I've had my Grand Voyager for a little over a year now.  I've never had to pour so much money into a vehicle as I have this one!  We bought it used with 60,000 miles on it.  Almost immediately the brakes had to be changed, including the parking brake which would not release when activated.  

The windshield wipers needed changing.  Simple and inexpensive, right?  Wrong!  We couldn't find them someplace like Wal-Mart or K-Mart, we had to go to an auto parts store and pay over $35 for them.

Last summer the air conditioning stopped working.  I haven't gotten that fixed to this day because it needs a new pump and between parts and labor it will cost around $1,000 to fix.

I've had 3 recalls on the vehicle since I've had it.  One had something to do with the latch on the rear door, one was a fuel pump module seal and lock, and I can't remember what the other one was, I've lost track.

I thought it would be great to be able to take the back seat out for more cargo room when I went to craft shows.  But this takes two people, and I can never seem to get the seat unlatched from it's track without a great deal of struggling.

I have a cousin who leases his vehicles, he has leased 2 Dodges, 1 Ford, and 1 Plymouth.  He told me the only one he ever had any major trouble with was the Plymouth, and he'd never lease another one.

I see no physical difference in the Dodge Grand Caravan and the Grand Voyager, but for some reason all of the people I know who have Caravans love them, and I can't seem to keep my Plymouth out of the shop.  I wonder if this has something to do with Chrysler discontinuing the production of Plymouths.<br><br>
