            I already owned a Photosmart 200 that is 1 mega pixel and really liked it but wanted to be able to print larger pictures.  I saw the ad for the Photosmart 315 and went right to the store to get one.  It takes very nice and sharp pictures.  I can crop the pictures that are taken on the fine setting and they remain sharp.  The Photosmart 315 is smaller then the 200 and and not as bulky.  I took 350 fine pictures before my lithium batteries gave out.  It comes with an 8mb compact flashcard which does not allow many pictures to be taken so I suggest getting at least a 32mb card.  I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants an easy to use economical digital camera.<br><br>
