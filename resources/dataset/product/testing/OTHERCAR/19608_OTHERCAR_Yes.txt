            The Saturn SC is a beautiful car.  It is reliable, fuel efficient, and economical.  The third door has uses far surpassing the tuba or doll, but there is one problem.

I am 6'1&quot;.  This car proves to be a little small for me.  I am sending this out as a warning for those of you who are taller.  This little car can hurt.  Many times my knees hit the steering wheel and my legs feel cramped.  The seat just doesn't seem to go back far enough.  And you can forget about anyone sitting behind me.  With the seat all the way back, there is little room for back seat passengers.  

Cost put me into this car, but I cannot get another.  I have not tried the larger models that Saturn has to offer, but I am willing.  I like to be comfortable.  Saturn is a great company and hopefully another model is better suited for me.  Tall people BEWARE!<br><br>
