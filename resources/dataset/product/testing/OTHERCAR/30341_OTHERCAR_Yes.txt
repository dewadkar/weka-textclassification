            Being in a tight budget I assumed this would be a great purchase. Many people I know have paid anywhere from $200.00 to thousands of dollars for a Digital Camera. I am not into a Professional Photography field so I was not in need of one that whistles and dings. Just a basic 'Point and Shoot' and 'Focus Free' and all this for $60.00! Could this be real? What is the catch? All questions I should have asked <i>before</i> purchase. 

For the record, I am a typical Mom who likes to take up to date photos of my children as they grow each and every day. To hold their memories on film is very precious. From infants, children, adolescent and adults are moments made just for film. I am not an expert on equipment but I know quality when I see it, or should I say, when I don't see it.

I have had for almost 2 years now the <b>Intel PC Camera Pack</b> and though its attached by cord to the computer it does take much higher quality still pictures. I use this camera for close-up in room still situations. But as far as mobility goes, hang that one up. So to have a non-restriction, low cost and light weight digital camera was my objective. 

I think I should have set my goals a little higher. 

The programs it comes with are awesome. 

<b>~Photo Studio~</b> To import and adjust pictures taken. You can crop and standard adjustments. I do not use this program. It reminds me of old style Paint and my hands just aren't steady enough for that. If you have a keen eye for Pixel by Pixel coloring then this might be just for you.

<b>~Photo Fantasy~</b>  This is my favorite. You can import from Albums, Scanner, the Digital Camera itself or a different source. I use both the <b>Argus</b> and the <b>Intel USB</b> for this. Once imported you can adjust lighting or Mirror Image to fit into one of the many pre-made scenarios provided.

And many more. This is addicting though. Its simple, easy and fast. With printer friendly software. All TWAIN compatible.

<b>~Photo Printer~</b> I do not use this often. I use the software proved by my printer (Lexmark) and that works with it as well. But once you select the 'Print' Option you can size the photo with guided lines for emphasis and comparison. The quality pending on your printer itself. Also, great to share with friends for a laugh. 

The Camera holds up to 80 white back ground simple coloring pictures. On normal usage, 20 pictures. It is not self centering. Actually, I have centered every picture I have taken according to the box on the looking lens and each one is to the right. Now I adjusted so that I put the object to the left side and it is then centered. You will have to mess with yours to adjust to your discretion.

Under the LR (Low Resolution) setting the camera will hold several more pictures. Under the HR (High Resolution) up to 20, give or take a few. With the HR setting the pictures leave much to be desired so to attempt under LR mode, I can just imagine the 'greatness' of quality for that. Hmmm...

This is USB connection so the download time from Camera to PC is rather fast. I have a <b>USB Port HUB</b> so plug in space is not a consideration. If you have only one, you may have to pick and choose which one you use at one time.

From the pictures I have taken, I would have to say the under 2ft away outside (on a SUNNY day) are the best. Inside at a distance of 3ft or more, even with several lights on, are not show quality. Again, adjust to your preference. 

Being I use my camera hooked up to the PC 90% of the time, it turns on and off with the CPU. Unplugged uses 3AAA not included. I have not taken it on trips for extended use so I can not give you an exact time. Estimated I say 20-30 hours life. 

All in all, I have to say the Camera is not horrible. But if you don't have a good camera, get the ArcSoft software and save money for the Camera itself.

<i>Personal Note</i>: I use this and my Intel PC for Yahoo WebCam, Making Short "HI" clips and also NetMeeting. Both have good Live feed quality.
