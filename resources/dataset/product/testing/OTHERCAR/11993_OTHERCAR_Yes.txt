            I bought the 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage DE in July of 1998.  I bought it primarily for my daughter to drive.  She was driving my 1992 Explorer, and was racking up 20,000 miles a year going nowhere in particular.  The Explorer is a gas hog, and I bought the Mirage after going through the shock of paying for the gas bills.

My daughter kept up her driving ways, and put 30,000.00 miles on the car in 18 months.  The car has been extremely reliable.  Neither my daughter or I have ever had a breakdown.  The gas mileage has not been as great as I expected, probably because this automatic transmission model is underpowered, and my daughter has to push it to go fast.

 When I drive it, the gas mileage is fairly good.  On maintenance, the only complaint is one that I have had with several small cars that I have owned.  It seems to eat front brake pads.  The first set did not get out of the 12,000 mile warranty.  If I had it to do over again, I probably would have picked the next up trim level.  The DE is pretty spartan, and the rugs are just plain cheap.  The fabric on the seats is pretty basic too.  Right now, much of the nylon has pilled.  My daughter went back to college and left the car with me, and I drive it daily now.

If you are unconcerned about cars as a status symbol, and are more interested in getting from point A to point B economically, I recommend this car.  Right now, I have 38,100 miles on it.  I hope to keep it until it has at least 150,000 miles.  A friend of mine had an older Mirage, and he had no trouble taking it to the mid six figures on miles.<br><br>
