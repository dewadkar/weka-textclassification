            I had sold my Altima just a few days earlier and was shopping intensely for another means of transportation.  It's August and before you know it, it will be time to go up to the mountains.  I've looked at a lot of cars.  Should I go all-wheel drive?  Or how about economic?  01 Civic or 01 Corolla would be ideal, especially with 4.9% APR.  I love the amber gauges in the Civic.  How about the RSX?  Wow, I test drove that one too and the car is truly unique.  But it's two doors and I need something for "down the road."  Okay, back to a car with stabiliby in mind because surely those other 2500 lb FF cars will win doughnut hole contests at ease.  I got to get to the mountain!

Before I looked at the Imprezas I checked out the Audi A4.  What a great car!  Leather, moonroof, euro styling, and their infamous Quattro All-Wheel drive system.  Stellar!  I couldn't afford, or at least justify buying a 2001 model at 27k plus (besides, the new one is out November) so I looked at some used A4s.  Best deal around these parts was a 97 black A4 with 72k miles and Quattro system, with an auto.  $15,900.  Uh, that's not bad I guess.  Called the lady and she said she already had a potential buyer.  Dang.  Some others were out there but with 80k and above miles.  And this was for a 4 year old car!?

Okay, back to the classifieds.

What's this?

<b>"2002 Impreza TS SW.  Rear wing.  Keyless.  Loaded?  <i>16,888?"</b></i>  Royal Moore Subaru in Hillsboro Oregon.  And what is a TW SW?  I did my research, gave them a call, and did a half hour drive out there.

The salesman drove it out.  It was white with a rear wing.  The first thing I noticed was it's unique front round lights.  <b>Very "JDM" looking.</b>  Looked like a HB with two extra doors.  Got in and couldn't help but compare the interior with the RSX and new RAV4.  Nice!  Guages looked kind of boring but that's okay.  We went out to a golf course and drove it a "bit" on the gravel.  The car glued itself!  Absolutetly no traction problems with no wheel spin.  Took a 90 degree corner on some pavement and no squeel, no drama!  Felt like a car with an all out SUS setup!  

So I took the car home that very day.  He tried to influence me to buy a RS sedan with a wing and boat load of other accessories, which they marked $21k.  Said I wasn't interested.  He got it down to $19k but I still wasn't.  If I wanted to spend $19k on a car I would have bought a RSX.

And now there's 284 miles now on my car.  I added a couple of things to it.  A fakie FUBA antenna (great Euro/VW look) and PIAA superplamas (9007).  I may lower the stance, just 1" to 1.5", nothing extreme, just to make it handle even better.  5Zigen and H&R and some STI are the only ones I've researched that make springs for this car.
