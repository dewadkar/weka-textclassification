            I&#146m 25 and have lived in major cities all my life, so the need of a car was minimal until about a few years ago when public transportation finally aggravated me past the breaking point.  Time to get a car!

Part time check encoder, part time student, and full time comic book publisher- my money was next to nothing, so a used car would have to be my option.  Went to a used car lot with some friends and ended up buying a 1990 Pontiac LeMans for $600.

I&#146ve had it for nearly 2 years now and it&#146s not so bad.  A female friend of mine tried to put on a new rearview mirror, cracking the windshield which added to the unsightly look of the car (it came with a small dent on the side rear area).    The only major problems have been the brake pads and the way I have to add brake fluid every week (had to have the pads replaced- about $250), exhaust system has rusted away (but there is no smoke from the car so it isn&#146t a problem... just a slight noise), and a few other small odds and ends here and there, mostly because the car is nearly 14 years old.

It&#146s great to drive, though I do wish it had better shocks and would turn corners easier.  The LeMans is a great starter car, student car, or car for someone who wants something to last pretty well for not much money.
