            The Suzuki Esteem is an interesting little car.  For the college student or those buying their first new vehicle, it can't be beat.  The price alone was incentive for me to make the purchase, and overall I'm happy with the little scooter.  After about four years with it, I've had no problems whatsoever, mechanically speaking.  Although the little four banger engine leaves one feeling a need for some power, once it gets going it cruises around quite well.  I also prefer a stick shift, which makes the drive a little more eventful.  In short:  The pros are price, low repair, and a real fun little car, (which by the way, is larger inside than what the outside view suggests).  The lows are little power, and cheap interior components (cup holder, ashtray, console) which break apart easily.  But for the price it can't be beat.<br><br>
