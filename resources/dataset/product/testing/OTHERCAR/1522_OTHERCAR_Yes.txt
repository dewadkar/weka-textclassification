            In the past I have always owned foreign automobiles. After spending 2,900. for a USED transmission to be installed in my 1988 Saab 900S, I finally decided to start shopping for a new or used car. My twin sister told me that her girlfriend bought a Saturn and just loved it. I wasn't so sure about Saturns, the only info I had about them I had learned from their sincere (and memorable) television commercials!
I visited a nearby dealership and test drove a few models. The salesman could not have been nicer. It was a very pleasant experience.
I decided to go check out an inexpensive Toyota and became frustrated when the salesman there was vague about the price and was averting my eyes and trying to &quot;make a deal&quot; with my boyfriend. We left and drove right back to the Saturn dealership. I bought a used Saturn and the rest is history.
I now feel as though I understand exactly what the television commercials were bragging about. Two weeks later my boyfriend sold his Toyota truck and bought a Saturn station wagon. A year later my twin sister bought a used Saturn exactly like mine(but a different color). I raved about my car to some co-workers and two of them bought Saturns this past year. We have been joking about forming our own &quot;gang&quot;!
