            In 1992, I was looking for a new car, I looked at Hondas, Grand Am's &amp; Saturns.
I already had a civic wagon &amp; I was pretty sure I would just get another one(no Brainer- right) until I test drove the Civic and noticed that In 6 years there were no basic comforts added to it. O f course, I was Six yrs older and needed a car that was a little more than basic transportation.(read better suspension , shocks, roomier )
I tried the grand am-  I really wanted to like it- It was a smoother ride, a bigger more adult car...but I couldnï¿½t see over the dash. The grand am did not have a height adjustment for the seat and I was to drive it I would have to sit on a pillow.(No Way) 
Next we tried the Saturn, a new car on the market, it had all the special perks that the more costly cars have for less money. It a very fast moving 5 speed that is wonderful to drive in all weather. Even thought my sl2 is 7  yr. old, I still get compliments on it stylish looks.
This car is a good basic car for a small family.
