            And it was meant to be. My Jetta was stuck from the back by a so-called �driver� driving a so-called �car�.  I had to leave her to a repair shop. What a misfortune: while driving a rented car described in another review, all the good things about my VW are coming back�

One year ago while looking for a car, after long investigations and exhausting trips to dealers, all having in common the desire to stick in your throat their �best deals�, I arrived at the conclusion that a VW Jetta would be what I need. Maybe subconsciously, my father in law who drives a Passat fueled my conclusion. Honestly, I bought it from a dealer who had everything in common with the ones described above.

Do you remember what was your first thought you had when the key ignited the engine of your new car? I will tell you mine: why took so long to decide to buy it? From that day Jetta continues to amaze us, being our trustee friend in the long trips around the beautiful southwestern US. It is said that the driveway feeling a VW gives, no other car do. Jetta GLX VR6 subscribes to this with its whole nature. I remember long trips, when the only purpose was not necessary to see for the third time the destination but to drive. 

Recalling, at the same time I bought it, we had to buy some furniture. IKEA was the choice as usually. Everything there in packed ready to be assembled, once is transported to your home. And here comes the point. I was amazed, being squeezed between SUVs, making Jetta look like a toy, who had to anchor things-with-strings on their tops, while the same merchandise fit in my �little� car. The reason? Jetta�s interior was designed by people who knew this job. The back seats can be folded in halves, or all together creating a huge space where you can put even a mattress (was not the case).

My little incident was in the same time the misfortune for the car I rented during the repairs. Even if newer with 5 years than my old friend, the Focus suffered badly from the comparison I permanently do with VW. The only association than can be made is: both have four wheel and take you to the job. How many cars subscribe to this description? 

And landing on earth, I will conclude saying that Jetta is a robust, reliable car, a delight for the driver, a �must have in mind� when shopping for a new or used car. Excepting the change of oil (7000 miles), the recommended maintenance, and distracted drivers, no other reason will put it into a repair shop (dealer?!).
