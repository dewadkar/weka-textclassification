               Let us start by saying that this car is certainly not the beetle that many of the older generation have gotten to know and hate. My dad, who once lived in a small town in the Sierras, has told me many a tale about the times he was stuck behind a Beetle that just didn't have the stuff to make it hp the hill at a reasonable speed. The New Beetle, particularly in its potent turbocharged form, is not that car. So go into this with a (somewhat) more positive attitude, if you will.
   We'll begin in earnest at the outside. At first glance, the curvy trademark shape of the Beetle is apparent. And when you get closer you notice particular things. Big fenders that stick out from the car, for intance, just like the original. In my eyes (I'm a guy) it's not particularly pretty, but I have to commend the folks at VW for building something that looks different that the cookie-cutter conservative cars of today. The paint is also nice, ranging from subdued black & white to the absurd Turbonium Green, like my mom's car. It honestly looks radioactive...but it definitely fits the character of the car. 
   Next is the interior. It's well laid out and reasonably well built as well as roomy, at least for front seat passengers, although constructed of cheap plastic. The rear seats are roomy enough, but there is a motable lack of headroom back there. I won't even tell you about the bruise I got on my head that one time...anyway, the only other problems are the small buttons on the radio, the fact that the radio has only a cassette player, no cd player, and the fact that the seat recline is handled by those annoying little German wheels. Otherwise, it feels roomy and is comfortable. It even has the body-colored metal part on top of the door, just like the original.
   Now comes the "guy stuff". That is, ride, handling, performance, etc. The very high-tech turbocharged 1.8l 4-cyl. is gutsy and reasonably economical, even with the optional automatic transmission. High marks here. Strictly speaking, though, if you get it with the standard 2.0l 4-cyl., let alone the diesel version, it'll simply be slow. The handling is there too, though the steering is a little bit overboosted for serious performance driving. That makes it hard to tell when the car has been pushed to its limit, but thankfully, traction control is here to save the day. I can't fool this little device, and believe me, I've tried. The brakes are excellent, with little fade and great stopping power. The car also comes standard with ABS, which will probably save you that next fender-bender. Overall, a pretty handy car. Until you come to the ride. It's busy and sometimes downright stiff, at least with the Sport Package, and only copes with cornering with the same degree of efficiancy as the Ford Focus, which rides much better. See my review on that car here at epinions.com. Still, it's livable and with enough driving flair to keep your commute fun.
   Pricing is something of a concern. All VW's come well-equipped, but you pay accordingly. Add on the options, and you're looking at some serious payments. Ours, for instance came nearly fully optioned out for $24,000. That's a lot for a car of this size. Still, it may be worth it to those who want the style of the Beetle and/or the panache of owning a german car without the inflated price tage from other firms like BMW and Audi, and you do get what you pay for here.
   My only other concern here is reliability. This is really the only thing that keeps me from recommending this car. I'm not sure where to begin with this one...first, the hatch wouldn't open when you hit the button to open it. then, the power window switches came off, rendering the power windows useless. Then, one of the vents broke, and a plastic trim piece around the sunroof control button came off. All of this is as a result of cheap interior materials. Lastly was the passenger-side power door lock that sometimes didn't lock - or if is was locked, would unlock itself. all of this was taken care of under warrantee, however.
   All in all, it's an okay little car, fun to drive, different and economical, but with mechanical maladies just waiting to pounce on you.
