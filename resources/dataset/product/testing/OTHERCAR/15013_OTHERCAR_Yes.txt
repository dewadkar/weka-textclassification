            I received a Sony Digital Mavica, model MVCFD73,last year as a gift. For a novice, this camera is very easy to use and operate.  With a 10x Optical zoom lens, it automatically adjusts to focus on the content to be photographed.  I have used it for recording backup pictures of old family photos and for taking pictures for sending via the Internet.  
The camera offers special features for &quot;Picture Effects&quot; such as Negative Art, Sepia, Black and White, and solarization.  With the selection options you can format or copy disks within the camera, choose an additional email mode for pictures sent over the Internet, and control the flash and quality level.  
Pictures can be viewed immediately.  If the picture did not capture the content you required, it can then be easily deleted from the disk and another picture taken. 
The camera also offers &quot;onscreen&quot; display features with indicators for the selected modes of operation as well as the battery life indicator. There is also an automatic shut off feature which turns the camera off when it hasn't been used within a short period of time; therefore saving on battery power.  The battery can be easily loaded and ejected and comes in a variety of battery life time variations.  The 3.5 inch floppy disks are also easily loaded and ejected.  
The only problem I have found with the camera has to do with night time pictures.  In dark nighttime situations, you cannot view the object of projection in the viewfinder screen.  It is somewhat an aim, click, and wait and see the results process, all the while hoping you caught the content you wanted in the picture.    
Overall, for the money, the Sony Mavica, offers great quality pictures, ease of use for the novice, and a variety of control options for taking and sharing great pictures.     <br><br>
