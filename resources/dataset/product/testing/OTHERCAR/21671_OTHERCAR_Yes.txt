            I have always liked small cars until I drove my brothers 4-runner.  This car is truely a great one.  There is so much room and the seats are very comfortable.  I have a camry now and I am looking into getting a 4-runner because they are trustworthy and fun to drive.  The pick up is not that good, but his is a 94.  I have drivin  98's and 99's and the pick up in them are exceptional.  Along with the outstanding features that the 4-runner's have to offer the look of the car is great.  Who could turn down what the 4-runner looks like.  They have done so much to make it look superior to all.  It is the sharpest out there.  It looks similiar to the Land Cruiser but smaller, which is better, because it is hard to manuever such big automobile.  The 4-runner is perfect size and it very affordable.  I would recommend 4-runners to everyone.<br><br>
