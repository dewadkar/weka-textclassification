            This summer I purchased a 2000 black 2 door Sunfire Coupe. It is a college students dream. A low price for a sporty car. My friend has a '95 Sunfire and has never had a problem with it. I love my sunroof! I have now driven a winter in this car and I think it handles very well. I have yet to fishtail, like in past cars. This car is perfect for everyone!!! The only drawback to this car is the size. My 6'8'' friend had a hard time fitting in the front seat. I am very happy with Pontiac cars. This is my second one and I continue to be a satisfied customer.<br><br>
