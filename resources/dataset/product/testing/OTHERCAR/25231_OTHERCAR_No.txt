            This is the kind of car that most people mistake for at least 5 other cars in the GM line-up. This is the kind of car that you wouldn't want to give to a friend - even one who made you mad.  The kind of car that you cringe with when you trade it in.  In short, this car is an Oldsmobile...

The Oldsmobile nameplate is one of the oldest in America, and soon to be going the way of the Dodo.  Good riddance!  With their cleaver "This isn't your fathers Oldsmobile" ad campaign and the introduction of the Alero and Intrigue - Oldsmobile seemed to have everything going for it - except that it's part of the multi-billion car conglomerate, General Motors!  How general was the 1997 Oldsmobile that I owned - well, general enough to replace the alternator 5 times... before it hit 91,000 miles! General enough to have the power door locks pop up and down incessantly until the fuse was pulled.  General enough for the turn signals to work, oh, whenever they felt like it...  Unfortunately, this car left me with a general feeling of malaise.

I bought my Forrest Green Olds off a dealers used car lot in September of 1998.  It had plenty of engine umph - good, quiet ride - power everything - alarm - 4 doors - alloy wheels - the kitchen sink - only 33,000 miles (with the rest of the warranty still left until 36.000 miles) - pretty good looks - just EVERYTHING! And, because it WAS an Oldsmobile, and I was (until I actually owned one) an Oldsmobile hawk - I JUST had to have it!

My first week saw me bringing the car back for a ton of "warranty work" - everything form the air conditioning knobs breaking off (later, I found this to be a common occurrence in these cars) to the alarm being improperly set-up...

It went downhill from there..  Between the time I bought the card, and when I traded it in with 91,000 miles, I had replaced the alternator no less then FIVE times - and the battery twice!

The fit and finish of the car was solid enough, the paint and interior held up really well, the AM/FM/Cassette sounded great -- but the only thing I can think of when I think of this car is being stranded in Temecula with a dead alternator...  Never again.  

I got rid of this heap - and got me a real car -- A KIA (well, almost a real car -- see my epinion review of my Kia Sephia)...  So, take this to heart, with the lack of electrical soundness in this car - and seeing the other reviews on this year car - steer clear of Oldsmobile - BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR FATHERS OLDSMOBILE!!!
