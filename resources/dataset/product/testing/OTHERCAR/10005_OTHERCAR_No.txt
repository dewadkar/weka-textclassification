            Too much to List!!! My car was in the Shop (21) days in it's first 2 months. The First time we filled the Car with Gas, it only took $3. Gas poured out the Side of the Car, because the Vapor Recovery System was Broken. The Dealership didn't even register my car. We payed them to transfer the plates, and they didn't! I found Out (8) months later when i got Pulled Over, my Car was unregistered, I had to pay another $65, they never gave me my Money back. I wen't to the dealer for an explaination, and 3 customers overheard, and left, so the Kicked us out of the dealership. Getting Our car serviced at another Kia Dealership was impossible. One Of the machanics, even took our car home with her, and brought it back the next morning and Our breaks didn't work no more, She was Fired! All the Guages had to be replaced. All the Rubber molding around the inside of my Doors, and trunk Had to be replaced, they completely fell off, causing my trunk to fill with water when it rained, now my trunk is useless! The Trunk Latch had to be replaced. I've had my car now 2.5 years, I paid $18,000 after taxes. I was the first in Rhode Island to buy one, then a year later My car could be bought for $10,000. My car is Valued at $5,600, and I still owe $11,000. Dealers won't take my car for trade without a $10,000 down payment! I,ve Had (3) starters put in. I've gone through (6) sets of Brakes, and (3) sets of Rotors, and Calipers. I've Had My Power window motors replaced in it's first year. I Average (150)miles on a Full tank of Gas. I've had 6( recalls )on my Car and Kia never notified me, until, I Had it towed in to put a 3rd Starter in after it died for my wife at work when she was 8 mo. pregnant. I had a Cracked Leaking axle, and a bunch of other Crap. "LOVELY" Every Time we take it in for service, they tell us they can't find anything wrong, and send us home, with nothing Done. I can hear fluid going throught the Steering wheel as I turn, Even with the CD Player on. Whats, is, it with the Body? Rain will Dent my Car!!! I think it's made out of Aluminum Foil. We find New little Dents on a weekly basis. The Interior is trashed! the Seats rip very easliy, be carefull, I recommend getting Seat Covers, and the Carpeting wont last the Year, With Rugs. The Wipers our Useless, I had to replace them with non-kia Blades. The Engine is Extremely noisy, and the Car shakes after 60mph. but it does handle well. Now at out of Warrenty, at 36,200 miles, my Cars transmission is Going!!! I know I've missed a few thinks, There are too many to remember off the top of my head for the last 2.5 years but you get the point. Stay away from this Little Korean Model!!!
