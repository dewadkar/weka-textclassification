            I was &quot;forced&quot; to buy a 4 wheel drive vehicle with room, this was the first s.u.v. and the last I looked at. First of all I'm 6'-3&quot; and usually uncomfortable in any car and most trucks. The Rodeo has plenty of head room and leg room. I am a traveling salesman, and the gas mileage is very good, considering the V-6 engine and weight of the vehicle. The ride is smooth, and the basic cassette/radio stereo is great. (for about 600.00 you can upgrade later with a 6 disc cd player!)I'm not much of a mechanic, but all I know is, so far I haven't needed any work. (I bought this as a leftover with 13,000 miles on it, I put about 19,000 additional miles on it in 6 months) And still no problems. It's a no brainer if your looking for an s.u.v.<br><br>
