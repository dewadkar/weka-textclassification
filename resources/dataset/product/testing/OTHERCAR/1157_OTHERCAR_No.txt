            This is just a quick review of the Dodge Neon.  My suggestion is don't buy this car.  If you all remember the commercials for this car, the Neon was supposed to be cute, but with some power.  Thus the slogan, &quot;Hi&quot;.  As we learned in grammar school, &quot;Hi&quot; is an incomplete sentence.  A modified slogan that better describes the car would be &quot;Hi, I'm a lousy car.&quot; 

While the Neon has pretty good acceleration for a car of its size (I believe that this is the only good thing about the car), it lacks many of other features that make a car appealing.  Below are some of its deficiencies:
1. Engine noise is too loud, especially when you accelerate.
2. It does not have a trunk opener (At least in the one that I was driving.)  
3. There isn't much legroom in the front or back.
4. The price isn't the greatest.
5. The engine revs/shakes too much when you reach a high speed.

I could go on but I hope this gives you a good idea.  Look for another car instead of this one.
