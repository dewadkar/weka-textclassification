            <b>PREFACE:</b>
After having many regular non-digital cameras, I decided it was time to change and modernize.  I always do research now thanks to the internet.  I did research and this camera came out on top for me.  

<b>YOU CHOOSE:</b>
To be sold on wanting this camera immediately, please view the picture that I actually took with my G2 and uploaded to my website with the link below

<b>APPLIED TO LIFE <i>(WHERE IT REALLY COUNTS)</i>:</b>
After having this camera for about 1 year, I have taken many, many pictures.  From Christmas trees, to my new car, to vacations, to the beach, to school happenings, even to gettysburg PA and Boston MA, and much more.

After a little playing with the features, this camera was easy to use and easy to learn when your far far away from the manual.  In fact, I never even really read the manual, I just did what I do best, play with buttons and knobs.  This camera is definatly hi-tech, but user friendly.  You can choose many modes and features such as resolution, compression, how long you see a picture after its taken, how loud the volume of the simulated shutter is, and much more.  Taking pictures is fun now.  If you dont like how a picture comes out, you can delete it during the review period immediately after you take the picture.  The great part is the ability to take 30 second video clips.  That puts this camera into a new ballpark.  Although they are not great quality, its a GREAT feature.  You dont need a panoramic mode to capture amazing horizontal images.  This camera has a mode that allows you to take a picture and then then view that picture next to the next picture so you can create a long picture that really used for example 5 pictures.  It comes with the software to merge these pictures on your computer once uploaded.  This same method can be employed to create vertical pictures and even 4 pictures that form a larger picture.   

If you can afford it (or have enough American Express points =) ) then go for it.  There is a little number of better cameras out there.  Make sure to read my recommended accessories below and consider spending a little extra $$$

<b>Durability</b>
Few come as durable as this one.  It has been banged and dropped and even exposed to very humid conditions, but keeps on snapping photos.  Quick Story:  I recently took a trip to Baltimore, MD and in the local aquarium, there is a simulated Tropical rainforest  with live birds and animals roaming the ground while you walk around and observe.  To keep that section humid enough, there are sprayers that continuously expel water vapor to keep it humid.  My camera withstood these extreme humid conditions and still took great pictures!

<b>ACCESSORIES:</b>
I purchased these accessories that made my experience more pleasurable:

-Extra battery
-512 Megabyte Compact Flash card by SanDisk (see why below)
-Tripod
-Memorex multimedia reader (improves upload and download speeds as well as useability

Why Buy 512 MB?  The pictures taken by the G2 are great quality so they are large file sizes.  This card allows you to take about 800 pictures using the second highest resolution and middle compression quality.  Is this excess?  <b>NO!!!</b>  On a family vacation for 6 nights, I took more than 400 pictures and 17 30-second video clips.  I can take all these pictures without needing to move them to a CD or my laptop to free up space.  The quality of the CF(Compact Flash) card is superior which means its very very unlikely that you will lose data left on the card for a long time.
