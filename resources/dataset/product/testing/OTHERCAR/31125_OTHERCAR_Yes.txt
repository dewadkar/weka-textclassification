            Wow! This is the best car I've ever driven. The BMW 750i is possibly the fastest and most luxurious car in the universe. The interior is amazing, from the heated leather seats, to the 20 disc changer, to the navigation system, to the spacious, roomy, and comfertable backseats, BMW has outdone it self by producing this fuel enjected monster. The car can tear up the road. With a top speed of 228 mph (on my car) I can get anywhere i want to in no time. I love it!! The navigation system is great too, however the sticker on the car 80,000 makes me frown. I did spend a lot of money on it, but hopefully my kids won't mind when they dont' see that there is a lot left in their college fund!! 750 babe.<br><br>
