            I am a proud owner of a 1992 Honda Prelude SI.  It's been treating me well for almost 8 years now, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a used car at a good price.

When I was car shopping back in 1992, I compared several factors, including cost, options (all the creature comforts), engine power, and fuel economy.  By far, with all of the cars in that genre (compact sports coupes), the Honda Prelude has the best (for loss of a better phrase) bang for the buck.

The only bad things I have to say about the car are that the back seats are basically non-existent, you are owning a virtual two-seater.  Also, the visibility, when it comes to checking your blind spot, is not too ideal.

At the time of this post, with current Kelly Blue Book pricing, the Prelude SI goes for around $8000 - $10000 in good condition.  That is an absolute steal.  

Trust me -- the Prelude is a great car, problem-free, and speedy.  You'll be pleased beyond words.<br><br>
