            Being a proud owner of a '92 honda prelude, my review may seem somewhat bios. Let me assure you that i am the most skeptical of them all when it comes to big claims from car manufacturers.  However my first experience with the prelude was flawless, at the age of 19, i was introduced to this car of luxury. It has everything.. Outstanding sporty looks, a futuristic dash and interior, not to mention the grunt of a 2.3 litre DOHC that just beggs you to floor it. Despite the new VtiR model, the 2.3 litre is a nice mid way. the lower end of the scal...the cruiser model 2.0 litre and standard 2.2. Sure it isnt as sweet as the humm of the v-tec, but it is more true to the feel as the engine responds to your judgements, not that of the computerized valve timing.
At the original sticker price of a new prelude with all the options, australian dollars would set you back just under $50,000. Maybe alitlle pricy, but what do you expect from Honda's ego. As a second hand car, they are a bargain hunters paradise. I snatched my coupe up for about $25,000 on road. This included every option you could imagine. I had a clutch problem in the first year, which was a sign of the previous owners enjoyment. After $900 to replace it, I literally have a brand new car.
 The handling is similar to Bmw's at three times the cost. The feel is alittle heavy but the  four wheel sterring balances the oversteer just nicely. Performance  is just nice. Maybe alittle under powered for a true sports enthusiast, however  i am sold. The 2.3litre produces a impressive 125kw, and considering this cars incredible fuel economy,thats enough for anyone. If you are light to the pedal, 10 litres of premium will see you travelling over 140km. Push the pedal to hear the engine grawwll and it'll set you back $$$ as she drinks your tank dry while pushing you deep into the back of your lumber.  Safety on most sports car under $50,000 often lack good features. The lightness of the car for speed usually comes at the expense of saftey features, but not the prelude. Although she is heavy, about 1.2ton,
With airbag and side and front crumple zones with intrusion bars, I feel at ease knowing that theirs a little protection around me. Having driven this car for over 5 years, i have only come up with two mayor faults.
My first is the lack of room and passanger comfort. Although it is really only a car for two, there comes a time when you do need to squeeze your mates in the back. Unfortunately if anyone in the car is over 5 ft, your pretty tight for comfort. 
My second downfall is the lack of traction she has in the wet. On dry track, the prelude sticks to the corners like glue, no matter how much you push it. On the other hand, if your track is the slightless bit greezy or wet, she could slip out of control at speeds as low of 80km/h.   The good news is that if you are careful with your prelude during the wet, she will purr like a kitten and growl like a beast on the dry open roads. 
I still own my prelude, despite an offer to buy my car for $28,000 last year. In my opinion the 92-96 model preludes are a collectable. There are many new cars built today that cannot compare to the overall enginerrity of the prelude. the new make is bold and ugly, and the legend of the prelude will die with this. If you have a prelude, keep it as they are discontimued. dealers  cant get enough of the 92-96 makes in Australia to meet demand.   
You would be hard doing, finding a more for your money vehicle for the price of a prelude.  Well worth Keeping!!.
