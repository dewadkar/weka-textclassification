            Today I went looking at new cars;primarily the Dodge Intrepid which I feel is great value for the money. But I was a little disheartened when I saw the showroom models...I would like to know who picks the color combos for these cars. Certainly not a woman, could be a colored-blind man!! Why else would a silver car have camel interior and a bronze car have a charcoal grey interior.  Now I ask you does this make any sense?? Maybe they should have a woman in charge of this department then at least the color selections would make more sense.  Still feel the car is great value but will have to search for some color coordinated models to suit my tastes.  Would like to hear your opinions in this matter.  Thanks for listening...<br><br>
