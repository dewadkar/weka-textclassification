            So lets forget that this car is all aluminum, has 300 hp, and even solar panels in the sunroof.  I mean this is enough for some, but I must say that the car is much more than this.  My girlfriend's father drives this car, but for a entirely too short weekend, I was able to pilot this refined beast.  From the outside the car looks pretty plain.  To most, the exterior is nothing really exciting.  I think it has classic German lines adapted to today's aerodynamic lines.  While I started off as a passenger in this car I was quite happy.  The seats were quite roomy and comfortable.  They offered great support as well.  Since this was basically my first time in a high priced luxo cruiser, I was basically impressed with everything.  I though that the automatic rear window shade was pretty neat.  However, after about an hour in the car the novelty started to wear off.  A short while longer I soon piloted this machine.  First thing I noticed was the stellar Audi steering.  All audi's are like this so I wasn't surprised.  Was surprised when the steering wheel warmer started frying my digits.  Anyway, as I entered the highway, I quickly depressed the accelrator and the car suddenly had a new identity.  I felt like I was in an F1 car as I was catapaulted down the 500 ft entrance ramp.  The 4.2L V8 was one of the sweetest sounding engines I have ever heard from inside.  The handling was another surpising issue.  It was quite firm and tight for such a large car.  I thought it would be like driving a harbor ferry as I am used to driving a small, sporty car.  Noope, it behaved like a much smaller sports sedan.  Some might say that the ride is even too stiff, but I liked it.  If you like your cars chock full of engineering marvels, superbly crafted, and your luxury on the side of performance, buy (at least test drive) this car.  It has a more German feel than many of it's German counterparts!<br><br>
