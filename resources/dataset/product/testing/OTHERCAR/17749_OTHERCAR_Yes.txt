The Saturn has a five-speed manual transmission. Since I had driven only automatics for the previous twenty years it took a little while to get used to driving with a clutch. I have always enjoyed a stick shift although I soon remembered the fun of waiting for red lights on hills. I like the fuel economy,and have gotten close to 35 mpg on expressways. The car has a lot of power for a 4 cylinder engine, and it will go up hills a lot better than a lot of other fours.It's a lot of fun to drive. It is fairly comfortable for me(6 feet 2 inches) in the driver's seat. One thing I do not like is the painted bumper! I can not see the logic to painting the bumper Light Plum(the Saturn-listed color of the vehicle]unless somehow the designer has a cousin who is in the country-wide automobile painting business, or perhaps the bumpers are not supposed to have any contact with foreign or domestic objects on the road or in the parking lot. Another problem is that the car is difficult to get in and out of,at least for this reviewer who is somewhat arthritic(as are most people who can drive a stick shift).I am happy with this car and I recommend it. It's not a comfortable luxury car,but it is a lot of fun to drive and the gas mileage is as good as the Volkswagen Beetles I drove in my youth.I don't recommend this car to .230 hitters in major league baseball as the car doesn't fit the image of a person with an income over a million a year, but for the less financially comfortable the Saturn SL is a really neat car.
