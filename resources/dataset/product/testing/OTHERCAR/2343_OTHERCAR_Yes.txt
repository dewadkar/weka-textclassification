            Almost every person who has used the internet has always wondered what the person they are talking to looks like.  When chatting with a member of the opposite sex, they often ask for a picture to see what you look like.  The Toshiba PDR-M4 makes this all easier than using ICQ for the first time.

This camera is loaded with features!  You can preview the pictures you just took, write protect them, change the brightness and contrast, delete, change the size, the options are endless.  Not only can you take a still picture, there is a burst mode which takes 8 pictures in 2 seconds.  The Multi mode creates a little animation making for tons of fun.  There are many different flashes as well.  You can make the flash last either 1, 2, 4 or 8 seconds, turn on red eye reduction and so on and so forth.  I took this camera to a local house party and it was the center of attention.  Once you've done all this you can browse through all the pictures you just took using the handy LCD screen and keep only the ones you want.  The camera comes with an 8 meg flash card which saves approximately 150 800x600 pictures.  

Once you have had your fun and are ready to get the pictures off the camera onto your computer it is tremendously easy as well.  The instruction manual guides you through the procedure every step of the way.  Installation is a breeze, it even comes with a program to edit and save all the pictures (which are saved as .jpg's). The only problem we had was because of an old cheap motherboard, it didn't have USB and the serial port wasn't working correctly.  Make sure you have these working or upgrade if you get this camera.  Another bad point is the battery takes 5 hours to charge and lasts for not even half that time.  However, you can pick up a battery charger sold separately and charge it super fast in an hour.

All in all, this is one of the best digital cameras available right now.  The possibilities and features are endless.  If you're a computer newbie or a power user, this camera is the one for you.<br><br>
