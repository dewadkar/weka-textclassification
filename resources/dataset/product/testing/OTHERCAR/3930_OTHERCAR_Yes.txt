            I got my stratus(a 2.4l base model) from my parents before I went to college. They bought it from a good dealer when it was new in 1996. From the start there was a couple of recalls, just minor stuff like filters and the sort. For four years it was our family car, commutes to work, vacations, and all the things that go along with being a family car. When my sister turned 16 they pretty much turned over the car to her. This is when some of the problems began occuring. These included a busted power steering pump(my sisters fault) a broken head gasket(not her fault) and a broken front bumper(her fault). She kept the car until last may when she bought a mustang. Since she no longer needed the car I inherated it. At the time the car had about 60,000 miles. From there i drove it to college and back home quit a bit (100mi commute almost once a week). Currently the car has about 111,200 miles on it, and from 60k to 111k, the only problems it has had is the plug wires wore out at about 80k, a brake pad went at about 90k, and one of the brake rotors is warped(thanks to the brake pad, i think). At 111k i still am confident to take it on road trips to anywhere, and havent been let down. Currently the car gets an estimated 28ish miles to the gallon and uses about one quart of oil every 3,000mi , and one quart of transmission fluid about every 8-10,000mi. For the $12,000 my parents paid for this car when it was new, my parents, my sister, and i have most defentaly got out money out of it. I would recomend this car to anyone.

Pros:  Nice styling, very good gas milage, roomy, good seats, very reliable, decent power, Good handling traits, cheap on the wallet.

Cons:  The dash may be a little cold and plasticy for some people, there were a couple of recalls when it was new, while the 2.4L four cyclender provided decent power I am sometimes left wanting a little more.
