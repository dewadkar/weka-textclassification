            After much research we decided to purchase the 2002 Impala. It is a great ride, very quiet and enjoyable.  The leather seats with automatic adjustment controls make it a comfortable car for long trips. The spacious interior and easy to use controls feel very luxurious for the price paid. I love the radio/CD controls mounted on the steering wheel. The huge trunk space capacity has come in handy for packing luggage or lugging home purchase from the store. The only drawback is that the front cigarette lighter jack cannot accommodate my cell phone charger. I have to reach around to the backseat jack to plug in. I've had mine for 10 months / 16,000 and it has been very reliable.
