            The Chrysler Concorde Limited (LHS) is a very comfortable roomy car that comes equipped with most of the amenities that make driving more convenient.  

Just so you know, this opinion is based on my perspective of only having owned cars from BMW and Audi.  The Germans make wonderfully engineered cars that drive beautifully and are built rock solid.  However, they are not known for building big cars that make road trips with small kids enjoyable unless one wants to pay $85,000 for the 7 series BMW.  My wife and I did not, and so we pondered the market and eventually selected the Chrysler.  

Here is what we've found from owning one for a couple of months:

PERFORMANCE and RIDE:
     The car handles as well as can be expected.  It doesn't have the same level of performance as I'm used to but is nevertheless responsive and has a 'safe' feel to it.  It is by no means a zippy car with strong acceleration, but then that isn�t its purpose.
     The only major drawback is the low swept hood and trunk - in a normal driving position you can't see either so it is hard to see where your car ends.  The shorter the driver the worse the problem.  I'm 6'-3" and can't see anything, my wife really has a hard time parking.  Unlike most of the competition that Chrysler does not offer rear sensors that alert the driver of the proximity of obstacles while backing up.  Too bad . . . that is a needed feature.
     The car also tends to have a lot of wind noise.  It isn�t striking but it is noticeable and on extended trips can begin to wear at the nerves.

SEATS
     The leather seats are comfortable - almost cushy by German standards.  Consumer Reports says that they aren't supportive in long road trips, but we've found them to be perfectly fine.  But since the leather is soft, it wrinkles quickly.  My 3-year-old BMW's seats are not as wrinkled as my 1 month old Chrysler.  I don't yet know if that is a bad thing, but it does concern me about the long-term quality.  
     Front seats have heaters that warm up quickly and keep you toasty. The front seats also have memory settings that I still can't figure out how to use.  Mind you, we're used to memory seats but Chrysler has turned an otherwise easy process into an infuriating ordeal that defies logic.
     Cup holders are conveniently located in the front and back armrests.  The front set pop out on demand.  Those in the rear are built into the armrest and make a nice place to put crayons and other kid stuff.  In fact the rear armrest has a clever compartment that neatly doubles as a small toy chest.  This coupled with really generous pockets behind the front seats makes for easy stowage of all the paraphernalia that kids need on road trips.  The front compartment under the center armrest is also pretty room and has a convenient power outlet that makes a perfect place to keep a portable cell phone.

DASH AND INSTRUMENTATION:
     The dash is laid out fairly logically with all of the controls being grouped by function and easy to see and reach even at night. The dials (speedometer, clock, engine RPM) are backlit with a cool greenish blue color that is easy to read at night and gives the upper dash an elegant style.  However this is coupled with temperature and radio displays on the lower dash / console that have a cheap digital clock look. This goes along with the dash being mostly plastic with only a few touches of wood that look more like an afterthought than a design element.
     There are some really stupid design flaws.  (1) The cruise control buttons are built into the steering wheel.  They are not lit, so at night it is impossible to see them unless you turn on the overhead reading lamps.  (Major safety issue!)  (2) Neither are the window controls nor door handles lit.  Thus one must feel around in the dark for a way to open the door or close the window.  (3) There are also some buttons on they steering wheel that enables the driver to control the stereo.  I love this feature on my BMW because I don't have to take my eyes off the road to make minor adjustments.  However, Chrysler has put these buttons on the BACK side of the steering wheel of all places!  They are hard to reach and give no clue as to what they do - so they are useless.
     The windows lack a very handy auto up and down feature of most German cars that allow one to fully open or close the window with just one tap.  Only the driver�s window has this in the Chrysler and it is only down.  The rear windows also don�t fully lower � they stop half way as if this is some big safety feature.  Too my mind it is only an inconvenience.

TRUNK:
     The trunk is huge and has a really handy cargo net that effectively creates two separate compartments and prevents contents from rolling or sliding.  Unfortunately, the trunk can only be opened by pressing a button on the dashboard or by using the key.  I really miss the ability that German cars have to open the trunk like one opens a car door with a latch and not have to fumble with keys or first open the driver�s door.

GPS Navigation
     There isn�t one � even as a dealer installed option.  What a shame!  The Chrysler vans have them as available options, but not the cars for some strange reason.  Our salesman did suggest a nearby installer who did a first class job installing an aftermarket version of the Chrysler GPS system that goes in their vans.  The cost was about $2,500 but the safety and convenience that such systems offer makes it well worth the price.
