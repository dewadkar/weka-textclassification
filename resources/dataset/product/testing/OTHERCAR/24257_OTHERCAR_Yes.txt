            Wow! What a great vehicle! We had almost always purchased Toyotas until this year when we bought our first Montero Sport. We bought it because the Isuzu Rodeo we had was so bumpy and I couldn't see over the tire on the back of it. We are so glad we bought the Montero Sport because it is so comfortable and quiet.  It has a feature to raise the drivers seat for those of us who are short. I love to drive it and you will too. It has a luxurious ride and look. It takes the bumps better than any other SUV, and we tried most of them. It has great speaker sound and a quiet ride so you can hear the music, instead of the outside noises. Also, there is very little wind noise. The air conditioner really cools in this southern heat. There is plenty of back seat and storage room. Also, there are hidden storage compartments in the back under the floor. Plus there is a regular size spare tire under the car not on the back.
There are only a few things that I would change. One is that they should offer more colors for the exterior. We bought a white one but wanted red. Also, we bought the upgraded edition, but not the one with the leather seats. However, it only came with a radio and CD player, no cassette player which we really need. Also, when they put the seat raising handle on the side of the drivers seat, they didn't think about the fact that it would catch the edge of a woman's skirt. I have to really be careful and not embarrass myself by getting my slim skirts caught by it.
Overall...it is a wonderful vehicle! Any driver would love it, but especially those who need and want a quiet SUV with lots of room.<br><br>
