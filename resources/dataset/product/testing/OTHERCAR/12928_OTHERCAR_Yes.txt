            I own a 93 Mercury Cougar. Although it is a bit larger than the other cars I own, it still feels nimble around town. The seats are extremely comfortable to sit in. People have fallen asleep in than many times before. There's plenty of room up front, but don't expect an adult to sit in the back for long.

The v8 isn't as powerfull as some that I have seen, but the power is there when you need it. Step on the gas and you can definatly feel the power of a big American V8. Build quality is as most of Ford products. Average.

There are some problems with it however. Such as the a/c. I've replaced the control panel 4 times, and it keeps breaking. I've almost given up on it.<br><br>
