            Go buy this car before it's too late!  Mercury recently announced that it is discontinuing this great car because of slow sales.  It's too bad because it's a great car.

We test drove both the Mercury Mystique and the Ford Contour, as well as other cars in this size/price category--Saturn, Honda Accord, Chevy Malibu.  The Mystique was identical to the Contour in price, size, and nearly so in shape.  But the feel of the drive was much smoother in the Mystique and tremendously quieter.  I believe there is some additional sound insulation in the Mystique that accounts for this.

Compared to other cars we tested, the Mystique was larger, more comfortable, and a much better value.  The price we paid wouldn't have gotten even the base Accord or Malibu.  Even the Saturn with the same options was more expensive.

One year and nearly 20,000 miles later, we still love the car.  We've had no problems with it and it continues to be a great car.

In short, the Mystique is a fantastic value, and if you are looking for cars in this price range, you should snap it up before it's gone forever!<br><br>
