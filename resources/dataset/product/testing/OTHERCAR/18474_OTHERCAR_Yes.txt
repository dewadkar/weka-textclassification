            The 2002 Lexus IS 300, known as the Altezza in Japan, has finally come over to the U.S. in manual transmission form.  Man, it makes all the difference.  I test drove a friend's, yes, it took awhile for me to beg him into it.  Let me tell you all about it.  I may have to ask him for another...

Exterior: Beautiful lines, 17 inch alloys wrapped in low-profile Pirellis, and HID lights accentuate the exterior.  The altezza-style tailights, thus the moniker in Japan, are surrounded by the more sophisticated, less loud dark chrome setting.  This is a drastic improvement aesthetically from the 2000-2001 models.  The car is beautiful on the exterior, no ifs, ands, or buts.

Interior: Comfortable seating, a little skimpy on the leg room, and ergonomic and convenient knobs and controls.  Automatic climate, temperature readings on the rear view window, and leather/suede combination seats are some of the amenities of this car.  The chrome shift knob and the racing-style pedals are some of the sport characteristics of the IS 300.

Under the Hood: Vroooooom.  Wow. Smooth gear-shifts, excellent acceleration.  It purrs when you're taking it easy, but roars when you need it off the line.  This I-6 revs like no other in its class.  Stock strut bar, with plenty of room in the engine bay for modifications if that suits you.  This car's engine is a work of art, expected from the the Honda/Lexus camp.
