              We bought this vehicle back in 96 when we had our first child, we were looking for a safe, economical, reliable vehicle to tote around our precious cargo.
  
  Our Neon has serviced us well over the past 4 years.  I am very impressed with the roomy interior and I fell in love with it's cute body style back when they were first introduced.  We actually bought the original white highline with the roof racks we loved it so much from the commercials.  For a small car she feels very sturdy and is a dream to drive.
  
  We drove her all the way from NY to California and back without a problem while towing a 1000lb pop-up.  We were able to maintain a good rate of speed even with the camper on the back.  It was almost like towing nothing at all.  Now we have two children who fit quite comfortably in the back seat each in their own car-seats. 

 We have only hit one problem in the past few years and that is that occasionally our gauges quit leaving us with no use of the speedometer and occasionally the fuel gauge.   

 I would highly recommend this as a great first car for college students as well as a family vehicle.  We plan on enjoying our Neon for many years to come. A great car at an affordable price, and you have to admit it's kinda cute too!<br><br>
