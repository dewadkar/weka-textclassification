            <b>Love at first sight�</b>

In December of 1997, the Mercedes Benz ML-320 was HOT:  Motor Trend named it SUV of the year and other reviewers raved, there was a 6 month waiting list to get one, and dealers rarely had a demo because they were selling like hotcakes. The Mercedes was billed as the first to be a precision engineered �true� SUV, as opposed to a hybridized mix of car and truck components. Bottom line, this baby had all of the Mercedes appeal at a bargain price, costing not much more than other domestically branded  SUVs.

I had the privilege of driving one at the dealer�s and was hugely impressed by the luxury feel of this type of vehicle.  Tight and smooth with great acceleration, it handled and rode much more like a car than most SUVs.  We ordered our 1998 Mercedes Benz ML-320 that day, loaded with options including a Bose stereo system and a towing package.

<b>Getting to know you�</b>

Fast-forward several months to the long-awaited day of arrival.  Beautiful and bursting with new car smell, the Mercedes so impressed us that it took us a few days to realize it had been shipped with the wrong stereo. In the first of what would become many dealership jousts, we were given the cheesy option of having an after-market system installed.  After forceful negotiation, it was arranged that the vehicle we ordered would be provided as soon as available, and we would drive the first one in the interim.

We had Mercedes Number 1 for about three months.  It continued to amaze with its great acceleration, excellent cargo capacity, comfortable ride, and surprisingly good fuel economy�up to 24 miles per gallon of premium unleaded on the highway.  We enjoyed its comfort on our long trips from southern to northern Michigan. 

We loved this vehicle, but wished it liked us better.  The Mercedes demonstrated its disdain in a variety of ways centered around its electrical system.  At any random moment, it would sound its alarm, summoning its embarrassed owners.  Sometimes it chose to lock us out, and other times exhibited a finicky appetite by refusing to open its gas door.  We became well acquainted with the folks at 1-800-MERCEDES.  Perhaps the vehicle liked being at the dealership, where it was massaged, bathed and vacuumed, as it certainly required frequent visits.

By the time Mercedes Number 2 was ready to be delivered we had moved 250 miles away from the selling dealership.  The new local dealership did not offer the spa-like amenities to which Mercedes Number 1 had become accustomed, and Mercedes 2 tried to play the �lock you out� and �don�t feed me that� games only a couple times before submitting to being driven and fed on our schedule.  Mercedes 2 was every bit as impressive in performance as Mercedes 1, yet with a much more pleasant attitude and the fabulous Bose system to boot. After driving this vehicle through a Northern Michigan winter, we were extremely impressed with its ability to cope with the worst of winter ice and snow.  Its independent all-wheel drive handled most treacherous situations with ease, and it even has a little dashboard warning light to indicate when it does not have adequate traction.

<b>Ch-ch-ch-changes, and face the strain�</b>

The spring brought with it a lifestyle change for us.  We purchased a small farm on which to keep our growing horse collection, and had to decide whether we needed another vehicle. Most horse farmers have a pickup truck.  Could the Mercedes successfully make a transition from trendy Sport to primarily Utility Vehicle?

We analyzed what functions we needed a vehicle to perform.  We needed the vehicle to do a lot of hauling, of everything from feed sacks to fence posts to show supplies. Happily the Mercedes transports our standard purchase of 1200 pounds of grain without breaking a sweat.  The guy at the feed mill gets a real kick out of seeing the Mercedes �pickup truck� drive in.

Since our hay gets delivered, we did not have to be concerned with hauling a huge hay trailer.  But what about a horse trailer?  The Mercedes has a trailer receiver hitch rated up to 5,000 pounds, which was an extra option we purchased.  Unfortunately, the Mercedes did not have electric brakes, and auxiliary braking would be critical for hauling a trailer anywhere approaching 5,000 pounds in weight.  Further, the dealership would not install electric brakes, and Mercedes would only provide a wiring diagram for a hitch installer to follow.  That scared the hitch installers we talked with, and the fact that the Mercedes delicate and temperamental electrical system would have to be altered really scared us!  With diligent shopping�and a pretty generous budget�we found a two-horse trailer that would come in well under 5,000 pounds PLUS had inertia brakes, allowing it to be towed by a vehicle without electric brakes.  We decided to take the plunge and order the trailer, and were happy to find that the substantial weight of the Mercedes keeps the �tail� from wagging the dog.  While the Mercedes may not be the ideal vehicle for toting horses, it does very well in light usage with a trailer engineered to work within its limitations.

<b>Four years and going strong�</b>

This summer brought the end of our fourth year with the Mercedes ML-320 and the end of the dealer warranty.  Newer models have a few more options, a bit spiffier look, and of course the new car smell, but the 1998 is still going strong as an all-around vehicle (and no, we have not bought a pickup truck yet!).  The fact that we, a mother and daughter team, have chosen to keep this SUV beyond the warranty period should tell you something about its suitability and the confidence it expires, once it got over its pesky electrical issues.

The Mercedes ML-320 is literally the only new vehicle we have ever purchased.  The main objective in buying a new vehicle was to have a long and extensive warranty.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, we have not noticed any rattling or other noises, except that the brakes are sometimes squeaky.  The best explanation the dealer could come up with is that the squeakiness is a common characteristic of metallic brakes.  Overall, that is hardly enough to mar the impression produced by these past four years with the ML-320.
