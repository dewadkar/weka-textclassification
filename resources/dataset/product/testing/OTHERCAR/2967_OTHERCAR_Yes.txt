            My Navigator was new in the summer of 1998 when we made our long-awaited
move from Lake Forest, Il (suburb!) to Bozeman, Montana (rural!).
For weeks I had wondered why in the world any sane city-dweller would want
such a road monster.  There was no question in my mind that, if I lived
in the 'burbs, there would be no Navigator in my life.  Too big.  Too gas
hungry.  Too much!

But then, Montana.   Yes, this vehicle was made for the mountains and can-
yons of the western Rockies.   It's pulling power is unmatched, as several thankful neighbors can attest to; and it was really terrific
driving over drifted roads last winter, though I do recommend good snow
tires.  We have room enough for our family of five and two or three
friends who accompany us rafting, hiking or climbing (yes, that's with 'gear'). Oh, did I mention that it does outpace a charging buffalo
with relative ease?

Even after all the jiggling of the past year-and-a-half it remains tight
and squeak-free.   My visits to the dealer have been of the routine sort;
and I look forward to next year's lease expiration when I will 're-up'
for a new Navigator!
