            We bought this car way before we knew we were pregnant. My husband wanted a new car and loves VW's. We were sold on this car for several reasons. First, all the options that were available on the car. We have a GL model and have a lot of features that other models called &quot;extras&quot;. Then, my 6'1&quot; tall husband could actually sit in the back seat of this car. This wasn't possible in any other model. Then, the trunk. Now that we have our baby, it's become my car. I can load the stroller, the groceries, the diaper bag, the pack-n-play, and anything else I might want, all in to the trunk and still have plenty of room.

We haven't had any problems out of this car. The SRS light on the dash was lit up for a couple of days. They discovered it was a bad fuse and immediately replaced it for us. The car is stored and driven really close to the beach with the salt air, and still no problems. It has 17,000 miles on it, and I realize that it is still technically a &quot;new&quot; car, but I love it and would recomend that anyone who loves to drive, try Volkswagen!!<br><br>
