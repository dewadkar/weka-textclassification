            I bought a used 1995 Avalon XLS and I absolutely love it.  I haven't had any problems with my Avalon it has primarily been maintenance free. This car is truly a gem among the rough.  It can come fully loaded which creates a luxurious surrounding or with basic options for everyday people without the high cost.  This car has lots of room,and has nice options for the affordable cost. My husband and I are both tall and we are very comfortable while traveling. Truly satisfied, and when it comes time to purchase another car in the future I will choose the Avalon again and would recommend the Avalon to anyone looking for a great mid-size car. <br><br>
