            I must say this: I'm a bit partial to luxury cars. I'm telling you this because I'm not the type to like luxury cars, being that I'm almost a twenty year old. And in the past as I've been told, a luxury car has to be two things:1. cost over $40000; and 2. It must start with a 'C'. The luxury car my father just purchased is neither. It is a 1999 Buick Century.
When we were at the dealership, I helped my father look for something that was reliable and at a good price (and something I'd like driving,too). Then I fell in love with the Century we test drove. I did all the normal things: speed up fast, slow down fast, ect. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. Then my father found a problem: it was so comfortable, we could hardly feel any kind of bumps at all, and my father fell asleep (hey, car shopping can be tiring). When I woke him back up at the dealers, he immediately said we'll take it, and reassure me he'll stay awake driving it.
I'll now go over the features: As I said it was a comfortable ride; has great stereo system with CD/tape players; dual weather climate control (perfect since I'm always cold and my father's always hot); great display feature; leather seats are fantastic, but dirty easily, so make sure to get leather cleaner; great leg room in both front and back seats; plenty of trunk room. It's also very safe with it having ABS, airbags, and daytime running lights.
The only thing I would have to say that it's bad is that it has poor acceleration. You always have to speed up very gradually, not speed away very fast. 
After owning the Buick Century for now over 5 months, I can honestly say it's the best car I have ever driven, so far in my short life. My father and I are very pleased will the car, adn  look forward to driving it for many years. I especially, so I can impress all my dates with my such a great car.<br><br>
