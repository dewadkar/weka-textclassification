            I am writing this review for one reason--to warn you away from the 4 cylinder 1991 Chevrolet Corsica LT.  This car completely died at 105,000 miles.  I know that they don't make this car anymore, but I am hoping to dissuade anyone who is looking for one of those $2000 cars from buying this one.

This car was my wife's first car.  She bought it in 1995 for $4500.  We had this car until 1998.  It had a 2.0 4 cylinder.  She did not drive this car hard either.  This car had no pick up.  It was embarrassing driving this junk.  The car was great when she got it with about 60,000 miles on it.  It started having real problems around 90,000 miles.

The car handled good because it was a smaller sedan.  The weight was distributed evenly.  The room was average, except in the trunk, which was below average.  The gas mileage was great.  It got like 24 and 35.  We only filled this thing up like twice a month.  

The biggest thing about this car is that it did not run well.  When you started it, it would shake violently.  It got to the point, right around 100,000 miles, that you would have to drive real slow to avoid hitting stoplights because it would die.  If you went over 60 mph it would die.  No mechanic could figure our why.  They said they had ideas, but could not guarantee spending the $900 to fix it would work.

The interior absolutely fell apart.  The trim on the radio fell off.  The side compartments both came off.  The radio knob came off, never to be seen again.  The vents were broken--you couldn't aim them.  The tip of the shifter knob liked to play hide and seek.  The turn signals worked at the speed of light.  Part of the outside trim came loose.  This car just looked and ran horrible.

I don't think the Corsicas are horrible cars; just the 4 cylinder ones.  I had a 1992 V6 that was great.  I don't know, even the interior to mine held up.  Maybe they got better in 1992.  I know another guy who had a 1991 V6 that fell apart too.  Hmmm...

I am just saying that you should avoid any Corsica earlier than 1992.  My wife may disagree with me, but she is biased...<br><br>
