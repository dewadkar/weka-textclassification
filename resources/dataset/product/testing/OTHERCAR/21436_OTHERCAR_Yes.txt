            Amazingly enough, and despite the derision of friends and colleagues, I still drive my 19-year-old 1982 Nissan Stanza 4-dr hatchback.  I paid $1600 for it in 1989, and have since spent three times that in repairs and maintenance.  Why, one asks?  Well, it IS a good car.  Despite chewing through front stub axles at a great rate and some transmission problems, it has some very nice features -- more back seat room than any car its size I've seen, impressive load-carrying capacity (lawn mowers, for instance) with the seats folded down, and amazing paint durability in the savage ultraviolet of Colorado, while always parked outside.  Also, I dig its looks -- it's more rounded than the boxy VWs and domestics of its day, and it thankfully managed to bypass the &quot;melted&quot; look that is now finally falling out of favor.

More than this, though, my trusty auto (dubbed &quot;Justine,&quot; after Justine Bateman, I think)has been a fertile ground for self-expression.  I have modestly &quot;tricked it out&quot; with 14-inch wheels from a 1984 Toyota Celica, laboriously hand-repainted by me and my then-girlfriend.  It has a fairly powerful Sony CD Player/stereo receiver, run through converted bookshelf speakers covered in chicken wire.  I have pulled the transmission twice, once to replace a shredded differential and once to replace the clutch.  I've replaced stub axles four or five times, repaired a blown head gasket and filled the attendant crack in the engine block with marine epoxy, and replaced the original peeling vinyl front and rear seats with fabric ones from a higher-model donor from the junkyard ($100).  

The junkyard has been fertile ground as well for ministering to injuries sustained through the carelessness of others: a model of the same color contributed a rear hatch ($100) and front bumper ($100) after a rock through the window and the high-speed reversal of the driver in front of me rendered the originals useless.  Parts at my local junkyard fall into either the $10 or $100 category: when I fried the IC ignition unit and was told a replacement was $254 from the dealer, I rooted around in an old pickup bed at my salvage yard and found an entire replacement distributor for, yes, $10.

Now my friend needs a fifth gear synchromesh, new coils and struts, and a paint job.  It makes no sense at all from an economic standpoint to do this.  Yet this is MY car, the only car I have ever owned, and by this point I feel just about like I've built her with my own two hands.  Economics don't enter into it.  This is a labor of love.  Besides, I'm now very good at pulling transmissions, and once I get around to fiddling with the carburetor, she'll purr like a kitten . . . <br><br>
