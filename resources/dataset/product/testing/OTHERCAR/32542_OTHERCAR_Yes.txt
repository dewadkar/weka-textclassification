            In the summer of 1997, we found ourselves needing a new car.  Neither one of our vehicles was running, so we didn't even have a way to get to a car dealer.  I remembered the television ad about the little old lady that the Saturn dealership flew in to their dealership.  She flew in, and drove a new Saturn home.  I called the closest Saturn dealer and they picked us up within 2 hrs. We drove a new Saturn home a few hours later.  I call it my "I turned 50, the kids are gone, and I got a promotion" car.  

Over the last few years, I have only had a couple of occasions to work with Saturn's customer service.  One day it was raining heavily (that's Seattle!) and the driver's side window would not go up.  I drove to the dealership and within 1-1/2 hrs. I was on my way home.  When I apologized for barging in, the reply was "no one barges into Saturn".  When they brought my car to me, the interior had been cleaned and a flower placed on the dashboard.

In February, 2001, I was alone on the freeway headed for the casino approximately 40 miles away.  At mid-point, I heard a loud clunk, saw a lot of smoke coming out from under the hood, so I immediately pulled over.  I had a blown engine, and only 16,000 miles on my Saturn (yes, I have no life and never get away, that's why the low miles). 

I had it towed to the nearest Saturn dealer.  They were baffled that my engine would blow at that low mileage.  They assured me that they would take care of things.  Even though the car was technically out of warranty due to the age, they took into consideration the mileage.  My final bill was $430.00 for a brand new engine.  I had it towed in at noon on a Friday and had my car back by noon the following Tuesday.

The staff at the Puyallup Saturn dealership made me feel so relieved when I dropped my car off, that I decided to continue on my trip to the casino.  I may have lost money at the casino that day, but Saturn made me feel like a winner!
