            We purchased our Bravada in the fall of 1998 so that we would have a reliable  family vehicle.  We looked at Blazers and Jimmys, and we chose the Bravada because it comes standard with many features.


What we love:
The Bravada has a lot of power.  
We LOVE the heated seats with high and low settings.  Great for those cold Midwestern winters!
Leather seats - they come standard.
Plenty of cup holders.
Large rubber mat in the very back to make it easy to clean up spills.  This does not come standard in some SUVs.
Folding side mirrors.
Smooth ride.
The Smart Track all-wheel drive is awesome.  It knows when to shift from 2-wheel to 4-wheel drive.  
This is the third winter we have driven our Bravada and it drives very well in the snow and ice.  It can stop on a dime.

What we dislike (we don't hate anything about our SUV):
The back seat is a little small.  Two people fit comfortably. The middle seat is on the small side, but it is not too uncomfortable for three people to ride in the back seat.  However, if you have a car seat, or two like we do, the back seat is pretty cramped.
The garage door opener, the homelink, does not work very well.  You have to drive right up to the garage door and hold the button down for a few seconds to get the door to open and close.

Time in the shop:
We have only taken our Bravada to the shop once and it was for a very minor problem.  The knobs on the radio cracked and would no longer fit where they were supposed to.
