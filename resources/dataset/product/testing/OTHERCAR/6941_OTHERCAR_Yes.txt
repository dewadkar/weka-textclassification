            I have a 99 4dr Chevy BLazer LS.  Ever since I bought the car I have loved it.  The looks are great and a lot more stylish than the Explorer, 4 Runner, and other competitors in my opinion.  THe Blazer has 190 horsepower, which provides adequate speed and the acceleration is quite fast for an SUV.  The engine can be very loud when it is not warmed up in the morning, but after a minute the engine is fine and rather quiet, compared to the really loud engine of an Explorer.  The interior is rather spacious, but the hump on the passenger side floor really limits the foot space.  The leg room on the Blazer is not a good as in a Explorer, but there is ample room for almost everybody.  The interior parts are built solidly, but for those who have loud sound systems you might want to consider getting Dynamat to reduce vibration and noise cause the parts are all plastic and do tend to rattle and shake.  The seats are very comfortable and soft, with a wide range of movements.  The handling is superior when compared to other SUVs and the Blazer's ride is unmatched by any of its cometitors.  The ride is very stable and smooth, not to mention extremely quiet for an SUV.  The back seats are roomy, but if you put three large adults in it they may be a little cramped for space. The truck area is very accessable and large.  The payload and towing capacity for the Blazer is not as big as that of an Explorer, but the Blazer is a smaller SUV.  Turning in hte car is carefully done cause all SUVs dont turn well.  The Blazer has a good sound system considering that it is made by the manufacturer.  The intruments and the dash as very simple and easy to locate.  There is nothing really complicated about the car.  There are a ton of options when buying the BLAzer cause there are  three models that come in 2 and 4 dr choices, not to mention the (ZR3)offroad  or cold weather packages that you can also get.  I haven't had any problems with my Blazer yet and nothing has really changed siunce my purchase last December.   The price on a BLazer is way cheaper than the $ Runner and about the same as an Explorer with the same features.  The BLazer I think gets better gas mileage when compared to an Explorer.  The best feature on the BLazer is the automatic light turn on/off feature.  When it gets dark the car autoatically turns on the lights for you and turns them off when you turn off the car or it gets light enough.  Thats cool since I always forget to turn on or off my lights.  Basically I'm just trying to tell you that the Blazer was a very easy choice for me, beating out all its competitors in my eyes.  <br><br>
