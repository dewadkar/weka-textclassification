            I bought my cavalier 2 months ago. It's a 5-speed and I love it. I needed something practical for my situation. A nice roomy compact car, that was great on gas, and something I could look decent in as well.This car has ample power and the stick shift is a breeze to find gears in. The set up is great,cup holders for everyone and a standard C.D. player that has never skipped...even on the cruelest Cincinnati streets. The seats are very comfortable, and the rack & pinion steering is a dream. The trunk has plenty of room for whatever crap you have to put in it. And how could you complain about 30mpg. The only think I can complain about thus far is there is a gap in the passenger door where air flows through quit easily. I believe it's because of a few washers in the door wearing out and so it now sags.
