            It's Sunday afternoon; what's that crowd in front of the Mopar dealer? Pulling out of Wal Mart and stopping in, I found behind the mob of people the dealerships first <b>PT Cruiser</b>. Looking at this car, there's no way not to love it. The engineers who designed it, like me, no doubt considered the movie <b>American Graffiti</b> a turning point in their lives. 

The retro look fenders and the tasteful application of chrome trim led to a very visually appealing package. The interior was spacious and very well thought out. The retro styling was carried over to the dashboard and instrument cluster. The dashboard was painted the same color as the exterior, giving it a unified, old fashioned look. The functional gauges were almost complete, lacking only an oil pressure gauge. All controls, including power windows and climate control, were laid out in the center of the dash for easy driver access. 

I drove the <b>28D</b>, which is the lower end version. This model had cloth seats, dual airbags and car seat anchors. The <b>Limited Edition</b> model adds leather trim to the seats, and something called <i>&quot;Preferred Suede&quot;</i>. I did not see that model, and so am still mystified as to what <i>&quot;Preferred Suede&quot;</i> actually is. They couldn't give me a brochure because Daimler/Chrysler was charging the <i>dealership</i> $18 a pop for brochures, and the dealership had given them all out within 10 minutes of pulling the car out onto the lot. The seats were high and comfortable with very easy access. The back seats could either be folded flat or popped right out to enlarge the cargo area. The rear passenger doors opened to an almost 75 degree angle to facilitate easy seat removal. The rear shelving system had three separate positions, one to make a level loading area with the seats out, one to make a level loading area with the seats folded down, and one to make a table of sorts for tailgating or to cover contents of the cargo area, as this car is a hatchback.

The exterior of the car was some of the finest work I've seen from Chrysler in a very long time. It's hard to believe this is the same company that makes the <b>Ram Pickup</b>. The lines were all very clean. The way the chrome was molded into the bodywork itself was impressive. The fine detail work was amazing, right down to the enameled chrome hood badges. It's just too bad this fine attention to detail didn't extend to what lay <i>under</i> the hood.

<b>This thing is ANEMIC</b>. The 2.5 double overhead cam, 4 cylinder, 150 HP and 162 FP of torque was <i>totally</i> inadequate. I've driven stock Chevy Vegas with more guts than the <b>PT Cruiser</b>. This model had a 4-speed automatic with shifting inconsistencies. It always seemed to shift too soon or too late. In addition, while sitting in the drivers seat, look over your left shoulder. There's a superb view of the B-post, the seat belt bracket and the headrest. Other than that, you're on your own. This thing has a blind spot big enough to conceal the entire city of Memphis. Couple that with a total lack of horsepower, and you'll have a real adventure trying to merge into heavy rush hour traffic. Just hope they slow down to get a good look at your funky Cruiser. The fact that they retro-ed the mirrors down in size, both rearview and sideview, and rounded the corners to maximize 'funkiness' (thereby reducing the visibility more) only adds to this glaring fault. 

I took it out on a half an hour test drive (and had to make an appointment to get that). While that wouldn't be enough to tell me if I wanted to buy this car, it was enough to tell me that I didn't. Adding right to the retro aspects of this car, it did <b>not</b> come with ABS brakes; in fact, it had rear drums! The body roll and handling, for a car this top heavy, was good. The braking, however, was abysmal compared to what's available on the market today. Now mind you, this <i>was</i> the base model. Traction control and 4-wheel disc ABS are available (at a cost) on the higher end model. Considering the market for this car, however, young 20's and fifty plus, a better basic braking package than rear drums should be offered.  All in all, a very <i>un</i>impressive ride. In the price range of this vehicle, $18,000-$22,000, there are many other cars that are both safer and more fun to drive. This car talks the talk, but it doesn't walk the walk.

I had originally looked at this car for my mother in law, due to the retro styling and <i>extreme</i> ease of access. About two minutes into driving it, I shelved that idea. This car will turn heads, but it won't turn tires. I'd wait on purchasing this car until next year, after they have time to iron out the bugs, and shoehorn a V-6 into it.
