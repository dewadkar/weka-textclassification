            I purchased my 1991 NX2000 as a demo model. At the time, it was arguably the best in the "pocket rocket" category and was almost universally praised by automotive magazines for great handling and a very smooth 140hp engine. That, and the fact the NX was priced lower than Volkswagon's excellent GTI, brought me into the dealership for a test drive. I walked out with an great deal on a beautiful dark blue demo and haven't regretted my purchase in the 11 years I've owned the car.

Some things to consider about the NX2000:

- Unique, contemporary styling. The NX is, in my opinion, several years ahead of its time in styling. These cars still look contemporary today. In fact, because many people aren't familiar with the early 90s NX's, it's not unheard of for people to mistake them for much newer cars. I've never gotten tired of seeing that surprised look when I tell someone my car is over a decade old.

- Passenger space is somewhat tight. Consider this a two seater. In front, elbow room is limited and so is headroom. Legroom is very good, however, and so is cargo space. Remember, this is a hatchback - you can certainly load a lot of groceries in the back of this one.

- Handling is outstanding. In fact, an NX feels better to drive than many cars offered today. Nissan won a number of awards with the car, and when you drive one you'll understand why. Wonderful in curves and very stable at high speeds, especially with the right tires.

- The engine is very nice. 140hp doesn't seem like much, but in a smaller car like this it's a lot. This is the same 2 liter, twin-cam four cylinder (16 valves and sequential multiport fuel injection) used in the SE-R. You'll see 130-135 mph in stock form.

- Overall feel - This just feels like a more expensive car. Take one for a spin and then jump into a current generation Civic, and you'll notice the NX is far ahead.

- Reliability - Very good, although after 11 years, things do go wrong. I've noticed that only Toyota's are ahead of the early 90s Nissan's in reliability.
