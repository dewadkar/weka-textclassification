            I am still driving my 93 Regal - bought it new and just hit 250,000 miles.  I can't believe how durable this car is.  The biggest problem is the air conditioner.  I need to get it fixed about once every year.  I have heard that this is a common problem with this model year.  Also, there is some kind of flaw in the way the brakes were designed that causes the rotors to wear out about every 50,000 miles or so.  However, these are the biggest problems I have had with this car.  The only other parts I have replaced are the alternator at around 150,000 miles and the starter around the same time.  Otherwise, the engine still runs great, transmission shifts flawlessly and in general the car runs perfectly.  Still has lots of power and has never given me any trouble.  Someone else's review said that there is not much leg room in the back seat.  Well, I would have to agree with that.  Don't buy one of these if you're going to have a bunch of 6'5" guys in the back.  But if you're looking for a great, reliable car you will get plenty of bang for your buck with the Regal.  Mine's still going strong and I have no plans to trade it in any time soon!
