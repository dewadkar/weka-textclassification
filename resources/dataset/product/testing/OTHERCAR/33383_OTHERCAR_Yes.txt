                 I haven't been driving for long and the Volkswagen Jetta GLS is the first, and only, car I have so far driven (in other words, this is not a review be a seasoned driver).  When my mom was getting a new car I was able to persuade her to try a Jetta and she loved it, so we got one.  We got the GLS model, which has many available options.  We got the 174 hp VR6, the luxury package which included 15-inch alloy wheels and a power sunroof.  
    The car was great to drive, the handling was good, the braking was good, the acceleration was good (it is a 5-speed manual, I could easily accelerate faster than most cars).  With all these good things about the car I couldn't stop pushing my limits.  Until I crashed it right into a 6 foot ditch!!!  Well, let me tell you now, my mom was definitely not happy.  The car was very badly damaged, but due to the airbags and other great safety features, neither me nor my friend who was riding in the passenger seat, were hurt (except for my ego).  
   To conclude, I love the car, it is fun to drive and very safe.  It is also very reasonably priced for what you get.  I recommend you get one right now!<br><br>
