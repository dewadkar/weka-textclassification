            As a first time Jaguar owner I am very impressed by this entry level model. With the sports package and interior upgrades this is the most comfortable and best handling auto I've ever driven. Features such as the automatic windshield wipers and the back-up warning system only add to the mystique. Fairly decent room in the back seat for passengers. Xenon lights are really welcomed and the self leveling system keeps them from annoying oncoming traffic.
The controls are well placed and easy to use. The only problem came when trying to figure out how to change the clock to daylight savings time. I finally found the correct way in one of the three manuals that came with the vehicle. Also, the dealership was the lowest profile dealership I've ever dealt with. They were more than helpful, responsive with none of the pressure I've experienced with other manufacturers.
