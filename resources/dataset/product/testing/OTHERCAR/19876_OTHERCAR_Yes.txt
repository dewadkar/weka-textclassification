            The HP C30 is a great digital camera.  Being a first time buyer of such an item, and also not being that technically gifted, I at first was worried that I had gotten something that would take several hours to learn how to use.  Not so!  With the aid of the easy to follow instruction manual, I had all the features mastered in only about 10 minutes!  It is really a simple camera to use.  Changing settings is very quick and easy.  I have been really satisfied with the picture quality also!  The included software makes it a breeze to load images to the computer (Also included was MS Picture-It software).  One fun feature is the TV slide-show you can play directly from the camera onto the screen of your television (takes only a couple of minutes to hook up the cable (included with the camera)).  The only bad thing I can think to say about it is the C30's energy consumption.  It would be a good idea to invest in a good set of re-chargable batteries and a charger.  Overall I have to say that the folk at HP have a winner with the C30!<br><br>
