            I purchased my Honda Civic 2001 DX on a whim one summer. Its been a solid car since the day I drove it off the lot. My only concerns have been the front strut replacement at 22,000, 48,000 and again at 62,000 due to manufacturer defect. Also an odd squeak in the clutch on humid days. Other than that, the car has operated perfectly. Its average on gas, and I can get 600km's out of a tank if I drive it sparingly. 

I'm currently averaging (30.57MPG) 13.0 KM/L 25:75 Hwy to City driving ratio.  My monthly average maintenance cost per month have been $105.14 ($1261.75 for the 2003 year *projected to Dec 31, 2003) 

Great seats, simple controls easily accessible although I'm a little confused about the 'air condition' light that turns on when the defrost is selected. The car handles nicely and absorbs majority of road roughage and bumps although there is a bit of noise highway driving and a constant 'whirring' of the wheels. (This was remedied by a recent purchase of 4 Michelin Harmony Tires) Excellent, and rated top in their class for all season tires.  Factory tires were replaced with Harmony's at 64,500KMs.

OTHER: Shop around for your service schedule fees.  Prices vary from dealer to dealer - it pays to research.
Replacement windshields are roughly $340.00.

A great feature is the removal of the 'hump' on the floor in the backseat with relieves the pain of the person sitting in the middle. The civic however has a great amount of room in the back which is surprising for this 'foreign' car. The trunk is quite large and can accomodate multiple sets of golf clubs. Sound system is not bad for factory and seems to keep the sound inside the car for us conservative people who do not like to attract attention to ourselves as we're singing our lungs out down the road.
