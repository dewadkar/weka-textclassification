Blah, Blah, Blah

Not quite 2 years ago an amazing thing began to happen, I started to receive emails with pictures of my friend�s children, and of my nieces and nephews.  I thought, �This is wonderful.  My friends and family can send pictures to everyone they know through emails over the Internet.�  When the first few started coming in I thought it was cool, but I didn�t really think that much about it.  But then I started to get a bit jealous.  I wanted to be able to send pictures over the Internet.  This became even more important to me when my Sister moved out of state.  But the technology scared me, so did not feel comfortable making a purchase at that time.  When Christmas rolled around last year, I was ready to say that I wanted a digital camera.  I told my husband who set out on a mission to find me the best camera that he could find for the money.  Based on the opinions and friends who owned this camera, and by reading Epinions my husband decided on the Canon PowerShot S110 Digital Elph.  

On Christmas morning I opened up my new digital camera, and I was happy, but afraid of it.  I had no idea how to use it, and was afraid to even try it.  Don�t ask me why but it could be that I have broken just about every camera I have ever owned.  I wanted my husband to be the first to use it, so that he could show me how.  Determined to make me figure it out on my own, my husband refused to use it, or show me how to use it.  As a result my new digital camera sat untouched in the box until mid February.  Sometimes we can be so stubborn.  

Finally a perfect picture taking opportunity arrived.  I decided it was time to take out the digital camera.  My husband and I grabbed the entire box and headed off to my daughters last soccer lesson.  We got there and I opened up the box, still hoping my husband would be the first to use the camera.  Just then my son had a potty emergency, this was perfect timing.  I told my husband that I had to take my son to the potty, then I told him to make sure to take some pictures I then handed him the camera and ran off with my son, (giggle).  By the time my son and I got back from the rest room, my husband had already taken 10 pictures and had made two short movies.  After a 1 minute explanation I was on my way to taking pictures and making short movies like a mad woman.  Now my husband became excited about this new toy. 

The minute we got home that night he went and loaded the software on to the computer so that we could view our pictures.  There is a very detailed book explaining how to do this.  Within minutes he had pictures up on the computer.  We were then surprised when we played the movies.  We thought we were only taking moving pictures, but it turns out they have sound as well.   

Includes

The Canon Power Shot S110 Digital Elph comes with the following items:  Wrist strap, CF Card FC-8M, Cannon Digital Camera Solution Disk, Arcsoft Camer Suite Disk, USB Interface Cable IFC-200PCU, Direct Interface Cable, AV Cable AVC-DC200, Battery Pack NB-1L, Battery Charger CB-2LS/CB-2LSE.  Don�t ask me what all of those numbers and letters mean.  I put them there for those techies who love that kind of information.

Booklets

I think this is worth mentioning because I think with a lot of technical gadgets the booklets or instructions can leave you confused.  The booklets that come with the camera are very detailed and simple to understand.  

The Camera also comes with a system map which is very handy.  This little map has a picture of all of the things I mentioned in the Includes paragraph it then has arrows pointing from all of these things to the proper things that they go with for instance: the AV Cable AVC-DC200 goes into your video/audio in terminal in your TV or VCR.  This system map is actually a flow chart of what items go where and what you can combine them with.  This is very handy.

Battery

The battery is very simple to charge, recharge and to insert.  The battery pack is thin and slides very simply into the battery compartment.  It also slides very easily into the battery charger.

CF Card

Installing the CF card is just as simple. You open up the slot, slide in the CF card the slots eject button fully extents and you close up the slot.  To remove it you simply push the eject button.

Size and Other Physical Characteristics

This thing is so tiny it will fit into your jacket pocket.  It is not so small however that it is uncomfortable to use the LCD display while appearing small, projects the images in a perfect fashion and you get a great view of what you are taking a picture of.  If you need the technical dimensions (come on as if telling you it is really small isn�t good enough) they are 87x57x26.9mm or 3.4 x2.4.1.1inches, this is excluding the lens projection.  The weight of the camera with out the batteries and CF Card is 6.7 oz or 190 g.  although it does not say how much the battery and CF card weigh I can tell you that they are both really small and their weight is minimal.

The camera is silver/gray in color, and Is almost a perfect rectangle.  Although small in size it has a very sturdy feel to it.  

Resolution

Ok techies time for you to get all excited I am going to throw some numbers your way.  Resolution settings get progressively higher you have the very simple settings of small, medium and large.  Of course if you want a high quality larger size print you are going to use a high resolution setting.  If you are planning on using the image for something small use a smaller setting.  For email you would want to use compression settings that are listed as: superfine, fine and normal.  Ok here are those numbers I promised you:

Large 1600 X 1200 pixels
Medium 1024 X 768 pixels
Small 640 X 480 pixels

Movie Resolution
640 X 480 pixels
320 x 240 pixels
160 x 120 pixels

to be honest I don�t know all that much about pixels, I just know that the very mention of them gets my techy husband all excited.

Movies

I thought this would be difficult but it is really quite simple.  Simply go to the menu and choose the movie symbol, push the shutter button to start recording.  When it is done it will stop, movie lengths depend on what you are shooting and the conditions.  It will tell you what time is available and red dot will tell you this and that you are recording.  If you want to stop recording in the middle of a movie just simply push the shutter again.

Movies shoot at 20 frames per second   And can last from 4 seconds, 10 seconds and 30 seconds.  Like I said above though this depends.  Most of the movies we have shot have been 30 seconds long.  Remember you are also recording sounds so be very careful what you say while you are shooting.  

A Few More Numbers

Here are just a few more numbers for interested parties:  

Lens:  5.4 mm equivalent to a 35 mm
Digital Zoom:  Maximum 2.5x
LCD Monitor: Approx. 120,000 pixel
Focusing Range:  Normal Mode 57 cm (1.9 ft.)
                             Macro Mode 10-57 cm
                                                   25-57 cm
Shutter Speed:  1 �1/1500
Flash Range:  Up to 9.8 feet in normal mode, up to 10.6 inches in Macro Mode

All of these numbers were taken directly from the book.  Come on!  You didn�t expect me to have them all memorized did you?

Personal Thoughts and Experience

I can certainly tell you that I had no reason in the beginning to feel intimidated about using this camera.  It is very simple, like I said above it took my husband just a couple of minutes to figure it all out and took him just a minute to explain it to me.  I am not a technical type person and I find this camera very easy to use.  Of course I don�t try to get fancy or anything.  I just take normal pictures and normal movies, the most I will do is zoom in and out.  But if you do like to experiment with picture sizes, and resolutions, and panoramic views and all that, all of those options are definitely available to you.  If you want to use all of the special features of the camera it may take you a few minutes to familiarize your self with all of them.  The booklet has very detailed and simple instructions on how to do everything.  

The pictures and movies we have taken have all come out wonderfully.  We are always thrilled when we bring them up on the computer.  

Price:  My husband won�t tell me the exact price of the camera but says that it cost him a little under $400.00.  Knowing him though he probably didn�t shop around for the best price.

Disadvantages

The picture storage on this camera is unbelievable.  You can take a lot of pictures and the camera can store them all.  My husband went completely picture crazy at a recent birthday party we attended.  He still had plenty of storage left.  The problem was the battery died and he couldn�t take any more.  So the storage capacity of the camera out does the battery life of a charge.

The 10 second delay is also a problem sometimes.  Often when you are trying to shoot an image you will find that by the time the actual picture is taken that your subject has moved.  This of course is not a problem for still shots, but when taking pictures of children this can be very aggravating.  But I think that this is probably something that is common with all digital cameras.

Final Thoughts

All in all the advantages of this camera far out weight the disadvantages.  We have been very pleased and impressed by this little camera.  I would definitely recommend it, and I think that if you purchase this camera that you will be just as pleased as we are.
