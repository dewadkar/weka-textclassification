            any one looking for a suv should give the forester a try i have one and so far the longer i drive it the more i like it this winter i had no problems with snow and ice and now that spring is here muddy roads wont be a problem. Right after getting my Forester it was put to the test a long drive to North Dakota and back with 3 adults and one infant long drive but the forester did great.  My friends keep asking me to take it out mudding but i have to pass not that i dont think the forester couldnt keep up just that at this time its not my cup of tea and i just be happy jumping in with a friend.  Most people who have seen mine are very positive about the little SUV and from what I have seen of the 2000 model year forester will again be a good choice for anyone that wants a SUV.  I also recommend the forester for your younger drivers this would be an ideal first car for any college bound loved one.  But this is just my opinion check out a forester your self.

P.S. no I am not a sales person
