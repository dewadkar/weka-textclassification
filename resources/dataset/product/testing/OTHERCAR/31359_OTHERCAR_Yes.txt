<b>Non-Technical Review</b>

I'd like to apologize if I offended anyone by saying that this car is viewed by the younger generation as a feminine car.  From all 15 males I've spoke to (which hardly qualifies as "the younger generation"), they informed me that they would not consider buying a Celica for that very reason.  Some vehicles, like trucks, have a masculine feel to them.  I believe that Celica is a feminine car.

My Toyota Celica, a.k.a. Silver Bullet, was the very first car I purchased on my own.  It's a 4 speed automatic GT model.  I couldn't be happier with my choice now that I've own it for a while.  I was looking for a car around $25K that looks good and is reliable.

<b>Some of the things that I had to get used to:</b>

1.  The "grrrr" that the car makes when I first turn it on. But it was designed to do that.

2.  The back window!  I can't see out of them because the back end is so high.  I just need to rely on my mirrors and luck more often when I change lanes.

3.  The back seats.  What back seats?  I don't recommend this car if you plan on driving more than one passenger around.

4.  The sporty bucket seat has a 2-way adjuster, but I haven't really been able to find that equilibrium spot.

<b>Things I just LOVE:</b>

1.  The liquid silver color.  It is to die for.
2.  The sporty interior.  The air vents are actually cool looking.
3.  Spacious trunk.  
4.  Alloy wheels, they make the car look great.
5.  Automatic lights!!  Never had automatic lights before, so this was a really big plus for me.
6.  Great cup holders.  I didn't realize how important the design of cup holders can be until I met the ones that are placed in the BMW 528 (those might hold empty paper cups).
7.  This car really corners well.  Also, you can follow the curves on the ramps comfortably at 40mph.
8.  Since the car is quite low, it's easy to give it a bath and reach all its 2000 parts.
9.  The large center storage space that can hold up to 8 CD cases.
