            Sneak Peak of My Thorough Overview....

STEERING WHEEL: Rack-and-pinion steering. This means the wheel won't flip your car with every little touch. It's very steady, and safe feeling. It's all about control. You feel totally, 100% in control. European cars, what can I say? They're just better. Admit it. American cars just don't compare. (Message: Don't be blindly patriotic.)  Oh yeah, and it's got these neat little grooves on the back of the wheel for a great grip.
               -----------------------------------------

Hi. My name is Dope Ass*d Jane, but you can call me &quot;Jane&quot;. (Or &quot;dopey&quot;). I reposted part of this above, so you could see the best part of my snappy cool review while skimming for a good review. Smart, huh?

I have a Suburu Forester, April 99, Green for the environment. (Even the name, &quot;Forester&quot; goes with my true love: environment, woohah!)
I f**king love this car man, and I want to share the love:

Stats: April 99, roughly $23,000, paid for by my rich-bitch parents
Color: Green, with a beige leather interior

BACK SEAT: Comfy. Gosh, am I ever glad I agreed to go on a road-trip to VT with my mom a couple months ago. (I live in PA or NY or DE, to discourage the stalkers out there).  My friend came with us, and it was getting dark, and night, and I, consequently, was getting sleepy, and I fell asleep in the back seat. It's great. There is extra padding at the end of the seat, it's like, this, I don't know, big thing (firm and soft) to rest your head on. I slept like a baby. Also, the back seats are 100% adjustable when you pull this little lever at the top of the seat (one on each side) and you can pull the seat back a little and just float into heavenly sleep....aaaahhhhh.  (Note: The frontseats have little mesh pockets on the back, so you can stick your handy-dandy Rand MacNally roadmap in there for convenience.) If you want a car with a &quot;NOT IN THE LEAST BIT COMFY, SHOOT ME NOW&quot; backseat, get a Lexus. My uncle Jack has one and I hate the back seat.

WINDSHIELD: Wide. I'ts really wide. You know how sometimes you'll be driving, and then you look out the window and that metal bar that connects the windshield to the window on your left gets in the way of your line of vision? Well, hah, not in the Suburu Forester, baby! This is one wide windshield. 

SIDE WINDOWS: Big. (Are you loving this?!)

STEERING WHEEL: Rack-and-pinion steering. This means the wheel won't flip your car with every little touch. It's very steady, and safe feeling. It's all about control. You feel totally, 100% in control. European cars, what can I say? They're just better. Admit it. American cars just don't compare. (Message: Don't be blindly patriotic.)  Oh yeah, and it's got these neat little grooves on the back of the wheel for a great grip.

DASHBOARD: Mine happens to be black. It gets hot in the summer. Don't put your gum or sunglasses or video tapes on it. All three of these things have melted on my dashboard. Anyway. What more can one say about a dashboard? The Dashboard has this nifty little compartment smack-dab in the middle that's just big enough to hold a wallet, a pair of sunglasses, a pack of gum, and a lipstick. (Hopefully, you're a girl, because this review is written by a girl, you know, and like, I'm thinking a guy probably wouldn't dig this review cuz I don't know jack about motor, carborator, oil, or any of that stuf..just a little notice so you're not disappointedly p*s*ed off later).

EXTRA COMPARTMENTS: There are also these two utterly useless but fun to fiddle with extra compartments, one in each of the two front doors.  My friend put her Fun Saver disposable camera (a really tiny one) in the one on the passenger seat side on our trip to Vermont last October. We didn't find it again until February. Whether this is due to the car's compartments or our own stupidity is another question altogether.

GLOVE COMPARTMENT: A good sized glove compartment. Big enough to hold a couple of those fold-up state maps, 4 or 6 cd jewel cases, extra napkins, and a pack of Clean &amp; Clear's Clear Touch Oil Absorbing Sheets.

TRUNK AREA: Big. Not too interesting. Large enough to hold 14 small bags holding various items, such as my science project, my gym clothes, my bookbag, my casual-clothes purse, and a couple of grocery bags. Speaking of grocery bags, you should always bring your own bags instead of wasting our precious resources, but in case you forget, you can probably get, oh, say, 10 or 13 stuffed grocery bags in there. And if that's a bad number for you, it's probably because I'm a bad counter.

RADIO/STEREO AREA: Okay. Yup, not GREAT! Just okay. The speakers are located, like at the bottom of the doors, and I don't know, it's a good stereo, it's just not KICK-ASS. Okay, so I used to have this silver Passat before some jerk burrowed into me (I was stopped like a good girl at a stopsign in a high traffic area) at like 45 miles per hour or more, HEAD ON. So the whole frame of my car shifted and couldn't be repaired so the guy's insurance had to buy me a new car. But anyway, this Passat has the best f*cking sound system in the whole f*cking world, man. The car didn't even have to be on for the stereo to work, that's right, you didn't even have to put the key in, or anywhere NEAR, the ignition for this beautiful bass-ifying stereo system to work. So why didn't I buy the passat again? I wanted a change. Also, the passat had a narrow windshield. Of course, the lights on the inside were purple and red, SO cool, and high-tech and savvy looking/feeling. If I had to do it all over again, I'd take the passat, but don't tell Blake. (My car, she'll get jealous.) Also, my passat had cloth seats, not leather, so I didn't feel guilty all the time about sitting on animal skins. Oh yeah, and my passat had this great sunroof (or moonroof, if you're the romantic type like my friend Edna). My forester doesn't have a sunroof. But it has a cd-player, the kind where you can change the cd in the front of the car, instead of the one in the back like my passat had. So it all evens out. Besides, the forester seems more mountain-friendly than the passat (it was a station-wagon) and I am going to college out west in the Rockies and will need to haul my beautiful K2 skis out there with me. 

FRONT SEATS: Manual. I wish the seat settings had numbers so I could mark my settings and memorize them. Like: J7-14. I hate when people change the settings of my drivers seat. It drives me nuts. It takes me like a hour to get comfortable. (As opposed to my sister's Outback, which is like, a 97 or 96, and which is ultimately more comfortable, but which smells like her dog, Matsy.) 

RADIO/STEREO AREA: Too far away from the driver's seat. Not really within arms reach. That's like the only bad thing about it though.

REARVIEW MIRROR: Small. A little on the small side, but you get used to it. 

GAS: Holds about 13 or 17 gallons, depending on the day of the week, and Blake's mood. (Honestly, I have no clue, I know it's somewhere around 15 gallons) Use the gas that says 89 on it. The middle one. You know what I mean. Don't smoke at the gas station. There are signs all over the place telling you not to do it.

DRIVE: Drives like a dream when full of it (gas). Keeps going for a helluva long time after the yellow &quot;empty fuel&quot; light goes on. (I know, I know, it's bad for my engine. Shut up already. I don't do it except when I can't find a station.)

HEIGHT: Amazingly low, close to the ground. (Typical of a suburu) You feel very safe, as though you'll never tip over in a million years. 

FINDING IT IN A PARKING LOT: Forget about it. It's really roomy inside, but it's actually not all that big. It's very short...if there is an SUV parked next to it, the Forester will be completely hidden by this other car until you are about 5 feet away. It's small and cute! 

WELL, THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP! SO WRAP YOURSELF UP IN A HOT BODY-BARING PIECE OF CLOTHING AND GET TO A SUBURU DEALER TODAY! (God, I sound like a c*ap-a$$ commercial. Gotta luv it.)

BYE. HAVE FUN. BE KIND TO YOUR FORESTERS SO THEY LAST A LONG TIME. WASH THEM (INTERIOR TOO!) EVERY SUNDAY, or at least EVERY OTHER! ASK MEN FOR QueSTIONS YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO, BUT DON'T, DON'T, DO NOT LET BOYS (I.E. Anyone under 25) PLAY WITH YOUR BABY. THEY're UP TO NO GOOD! Love,
J                   A                       N                       E


PS SORRY FOR THE TOTAL LACK OF OBSCENE PROFANITY-- THEy MADE ME EDIT THiS THiNG AND SO I HAD TO PUt IN A LOT OF ASTERiKS . (*******)

                     -----------    

PS on the JUNE2K: I just found this website while yelling at all my fellow Americans on the message boards who complain about rising gas prices (we still pay LESS than EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WOLRD) and for being uanppreciative of this great country, etc: 

http://www.governmentguide.com/consumer/gas.adp

It tells you what you wanna know: The car ain't no gas guzzler! Woohah!
So if you don't believe a dopey child named Jane, believe this great site.
It's TRUTH, yeah. This car's so great, ain't nobody need to make up no lies about it.

RANDOM STORY: I just graduated from high school, but there's one math problem that's still bugging me. It mentions somebody paying 20 cents per mile for gas. And my teacher asked, &quot;Is 20 cents per mile expensive?&quot; and I was all, &quot;who knows?&quot;, in my head, not out loud of course. Wouldn't wanna pretend to be dumb or something. Okay, but see, I've been leaving my spedometer on since I last filled my car, and it's approaching empty with about 162.4 miles on it so far. So, I figured, since I pay about $23 per tank, or filling, or what-you-will, it costs me about 11 or 12 cents for gas per mile, and that's in times when we consider gas prices expensive. But then I tacked on about 40 more miles because it'll take that long to get to Empty, and then to the yellow light, and then after the yellow light goes on, I figure I have maybe 10 more miles. So it's really maybe only even 9 cents per mile. So, YEAH, Mr. Mathy, 20 cents per mile IS expensive, dude! If you find that my math is bad, it's like this then, see, I don't wanna talk to you no more.
