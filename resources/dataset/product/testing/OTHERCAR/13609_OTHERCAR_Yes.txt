            When it came time for me to get a car, I knew that my options were limited to pick-up trucks.  Pick-ups have lower insurance rates than cars, and are generally less expensive.

I was expecting to get a S-10 with an LS trim, and maybe a few other options here and there, but instead, my father decided to get the ,at the time, ultimate in Chevrolet truck design and styling - an S-10 Xtreme.

An Xtreme begins its life as a regular S-10, but during the later stages of building, it is shipped to another plant operated by on of General Motor's partners.  There, ground effects are added, a unique frontal facia is installed, special badging is stamped on, and unique alumnium wheels are fitted.  Xtremes are fitted with the ZQ8 sports handeling suspension package, which safely lowers the truck and improves mid-high speed handeling.  It is then shipped back to the original factory to join the rest of the S-10s and GMCs.

My S-10 Extreme was the most expensive factory combination possible.  The Vortec 4300 V6 engine (step up from the 4 cylinder), extended cab, 3rd door, sports side box, positive slip traction, keyless entry, and finishes off with the very fun high-back bucket seats.  I've seen several X's in my town, but none had the same package and trim level as mine.

All these options together provide a unique driving expereince.  As meantioned earlier, the ZQ8 suspension makes handeling at mid-high speeds fun.  You can tilt the wheel side to side and the truck responds beautifully.  Certain handeling characteristics have been compared to a Mustang GT and a Camaro/FireBird.  The ground effects, tastefully done mind you, and front facia provide you with a vehicle you are proud to drive.  The standard internal equipment on X's, air conditioner/heater, CD Player/Radio, and Power Locks/Windows all work wonderfully.  The heated mirrors provide an added level of safter, as well do the twin airbags.  It should be noted that all instrumentation is styled in the classic feel of General Motors equipment, and is laid out intellegently and comforatably.  Controls are just a reach away, and never cumbersome to use.

Unfortunately, the chasis and body style thats been in use since 1994 is showing its age.  The truck is unfairly limited to only a V6 engine, whereas a V8 option would be the silver bullet for Chystler's Dodge and import models.  The old chasis has a stiff and sometimes jittery ride, and although the seats are very comfortable, most roads send sock waves throughout the cabin.  Also, the door hanldes are rather tiring to use often, and would not be missed if replaced by units similar on GM's new 1500, 2500, and 3500 C/K trucks.

At 8,000 miles, the ground effects, while probably installed better than most after-market solutions, are not completely seamless and flush with the body.  Also, there sound leakage on my passenger door seems less than normal when compared to even older trucks driven by friends.

If you want an experience, get this truck.  Also look forward to new trucks by GM coming out within the next two years.
