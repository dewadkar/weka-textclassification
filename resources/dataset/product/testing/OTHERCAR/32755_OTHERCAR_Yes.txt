            When it comes down to performance, this car knocks a real punch.  For 10-12 k one can pick up a clean used model and really enjoy the thrills of a modern day muscle car.  
    I picked up an immaculate 1993 Z28 (the first year of the fourth generation model) over 2 years ago and have nothing but good things to say about my car.  My car is regularly autocrossed and drag raced with very successful results, with a streak of wins in the past 5 events.  The Camaro Z28 handles well and accelerates awesome, my Z28 has posted 12 second quarter miles times with 1/4 mile trap speeds over 107.  This was accomplished with under $500 in mods...... Now ask that out of a late model Mustang, or any other comparable model.
    With a 6 speed transmission this modern day muscle car also posts over 25 mpg on the highway, making it affordable also.  Parts for replacement are very well priced and reliability has been excellent so far.
    While this car is all about muscle, it is still a very comfortable car I have travel in many times.  8 hour trips are no problem with the comfortable seating.  

    I give this car a 10 out of 10 and absolutely love it.<br><br>
