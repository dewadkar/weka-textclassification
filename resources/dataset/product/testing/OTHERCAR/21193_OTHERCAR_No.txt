            <p>I bought my Geo Metro last year from an old lady who only used it on Sunday's to church. So, it only had about 27K miles on it. It was almost as if it was brand new.&lt;/p&gt;
<p> I'll get right to the point. The car was great as a starter car. It was small, easy to maneuver, parking it was a breeze, because I could fit into any little space. As far as gas, the tank would fill up with less than $10, and it would last me about 2 weeks! It wasn't very roomy, but like I said, as a  starter car it was adequate. &lt;/p&gt;
<p>Here's the bad part. The car doesn't go very fast. Try to take it faster than 60 and the car begins to shake. In fact, it would shake so bad, even the steering wheel was a little hard to control. And if a semi so much as passes you by, the wind from it is enough to blow the car out of control. That actually happened to me on Lake Shore drive (in downtown Chicago). I was only driving around 40 mph and one of those huge Envoy trucks passed me up. I lost control of the car and began to swerve through all three lanes. I almost hit another SUV but luckily I let go of the gas and the car calmed down once it slowed down. I believe this happens because the car is so egg shaped. (now remember I'm talking about the sedan here, although the hatchback is also a little egg shaped). So maybe the speed issue is a blessing in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
<p> If that isn't enough to scare you off, this is. God forbid you get into an accident, because then, youre stuck without a car. It is so flimsy, that in even a little accident, the body of the car can be damaged enough to total it. I had the unfortunate experience firsthand. My brakes failed and I rammed into an old pickup truck. I was only going 30 miles an hour, but the impact was enough to tear my car apart. The police report stated that the car was in 5 different pieces when they arrived. Now, here's the kicker, the pickup truck only had a dent the size of a basketball. Lucky for me, I only had three staples put in my head. I know that is what matters, but to tell you the truth, I rather would have not been through it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>In my opinion, this car is good, for a starter car. But that's it. I don't think this car is very safe. Wear your seatbelt, and pray that the airbags go off. But I wouldnt buy another one of these cars again.&lt;/p&gt;
