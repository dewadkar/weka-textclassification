            This is a great great car.  I live in San Francisco and it is the <b>perfect</b> 'round-town car.  It's small enough so that it's always a snap to find parking spaces and since it's a two seater, I can easily take advantage of carpool lanes.  

The car is very comfortable.  It's stock sport seats fit like a glove.  Since there are only two seats, there's actually a lot of legroom.  I've had people 6'5&quot;+ sit in there without any problems.  

If you remove the rear cover, there is actually a lot of space in there.  I've can easily fit two golf bags with plenty of room to spare.  

I get nearly 40 MPG on an engine with well over 100,000 miles.  I fill up (on the cheap stuff) ever couple of weeks for $15 bucks.  This, when all the super-only SUVs are paying $2/gallon and $50/tank.  Makes me all warm-and-fuzzy inside.  

The only downside I'd say is the suspension.  You can feel every bump and pothole in the road.  It's a pretty small price to pay, though.   <br><br>
