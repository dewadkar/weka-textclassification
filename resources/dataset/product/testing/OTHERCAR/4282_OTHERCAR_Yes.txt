                                            Bugged Again!!

The first time I experienced a Volkswagen beetle was in the fall of 1966. I was a 13 year old youth who loved cars. You know, Real cars! Cars like
a 1964 Chevrolet Impala Super Sport with a 409 cubic inch big block motor and all the trimmings.

 Then, it happened. Who would have known? Thinking I'd &quot;been there, done that all&quot; at 13, I was intrigued when my Uncle Eugene brought back a red, open top (they call them sunroofs today) VW bug with a grey and white interior. He had paid the ridiculous price of around 12-1400 US dollars for it in Germany,(don't quote me on the price)
and drove it around Europe with my Aunt Catherine on vacation.

 They then had it shipped to good old Cleveland, OH, where I had my first real introduction to the car. We drove all around an area known as the metro parks, and I was hooked.

Well, my first car turned out to be a &quot;65 Fiat 600&quot; which was the Italian answer to the Beetle because it was small, and all I could afford at the time. Close enough! The Fiat was smaller in size than the Beetle, had 12 inch tires, and was powered by a minute rear mounted water cooled engine.

 Regardless of my on again-off again love affair with little rear engine cars,(even including Renault Dauphines and Chevrolet Corvairs) I  went through the decades with many participants such as a '65 Westfalia camper, a '73 Westfalia camper, a '72 microbus, two '75 microbuses, a '59 beetle, a '70 beetle, a '73 beetle automatic stick shift, an '80 rabbit pickup and lots of memories.

 I picked up a copy of the magazine VW Trends a few years ago, and saw the prototype testing on the New Beetle; I was as ecstatic as a chicken around a June Bug! (And to think-it was only October!!!) When the New Beetle was introduced at the Cleveland Auto show, of course I was there.

 Subsequently, I test drove a GLS and later, a Turbo.(I don't remember that model- it was two years later). Alas, I still was plagued by the good old financial problem of getting a new Beetle because my wife at the time insisted we buy a Mini Van for the family,(yes, kids,) and to this day I'm hoping, hoping hoping!!!

  Well, here are a few reasons I would personally recommend the new Beetle to anyone. I have owned and driven over 30 some different cars, trucks, vans et al in my life, of which some were new, some were old, and some just plain odd!. Therefore I feel qualified to say the following based on what I consider some important facts:

 1.It's Comfortable!! I am six foot, four inches tall and I was very pleasantly surprised at the room in which I had in the vehicle when I test drove it. I am also large framed, weighing in at 260 pounds-yet, there was still plenty of &quot;non elbow smashing&quot; room in the front seats while shifting, etc., with my wife in the front-(I'm getting smarter-I won't disclose her weight, ahem....)2. The visual aspect was excellent with the wide design of the windows. 3. Ok, It's getting harder and harder to find that Chevy 409, but let's face it- these cars have pep! Especially the Turbo. 4. The following may not be applied to everyone; But for me, this next item is important-Noticeability! Yes, even today on our daily drive into work my wife and I exchange punch buggy blows to each other because we A. constantly play the game, and, B. NOTICE every Beetle, new or old that drives by. What can I say? I love getting attention, and owning a new Beetle would certainly &quot;feed the need!&quot; 

The following is but a short description of why I endorse this car. Don't expect me to be Tom McCahill of Popular Science/Mechanics fame, But this car is a refreshing, delightful and new approach to the mundane normalcy of all else what is out there on the market today. Go Herbie!!<br><br>
