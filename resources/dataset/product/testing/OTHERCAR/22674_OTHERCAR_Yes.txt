               The main problem I have had with my 96 Grand am is the power windows.  The motor went out in 98.  Two years after I had the car.  I rarely ever even use the passenger window, not to mention I live in Chicago and only roll my window down for 6 months out of the year anyway.  My sister, also the proud owner of a 95 Grand Am had her Front and rear passenger window go dead.  My cousin had a Grand Am, the passenger window went did.

  Of course all were after the warranty had expired.  I tried to fix the window myself just by getting a new motor and it was very very difficult.  I got it to work, but it still is not right.  My driver side window has never sealed correctly so you constantly hear air coming in and you can now see it is starting to roll up uneven.  I called Pontiac and they have said there is no defect in their power window motors.  This is ridiculous.  I think its very ironic that three people just in my family that have grand ams have had problems.  I have also seen probably 20 Grand Ams either driving or in parking lots with their windows crooked. 
  
  So I say forget you Pontiac.  When it is a certifiable problem that is going on you should have stepped up and took care of it, instead you hid and for that you lost my entire families business and anyone else that I can talk to forever.<br><br>
