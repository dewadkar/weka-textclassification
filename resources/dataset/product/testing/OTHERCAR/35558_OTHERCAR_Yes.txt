            I decided in 2001 that it was time to replace my old 1993 Mercury Topaz with a newer car.  The old Topaz saw me through quite a few years but I was afraid it was getting tired.  I also got tired of literally standing on the gas pedal, pushing it all the way to the floor, when I wanted to go up a hill.   That car had no power at all...I also needed to turn the A/C off when going uphill!!

I set out to the used car lots first and saw nothing that interested me.  Then I saw an ad in the Sunday paper for the Honda Civic.  I decided to do something totally foreign to me...I decided to buy a brand new car.  

Once I test drove the '01 Honda Civic, I was sold.  I wanted that car.   It had a great feel to it, handled well and surprisingly, had quite a bit of pick up!  (I believe the engine is 112 horse power)   I ended up trading in the old Topaz for the Civic and I have NOT been the least bit sorry.  The Civic has not let me down once and it is going on 2 1/2 years now.  

I bought the DX model (the lowest end Civic) that does not come with standard power windows or locks etc.  However, those types of features don't fascinate me. (The price of the DX model is what fascinated me!!) If I am warm, I turn the A/C on (I almost never drive with the windows down) and power door locks, to me, are not a priority for a two door car.  When I have a guest passenger it does not burden me to reach over and flick the lock up. Or to unlock their side first.   I mean how simple does one expect life to be??

I get approximately 32 miles to the gallon on the highway and about 27-28 mpg on city streets.  NOT BAD!!! Especially considering today's gas prices.  In the North East, we are at over $2.00 a gallon in some spots now.  Yikes!

Another great thing about all Hondas in general is that they all have such a solid feel to them.  I have test driven some of the other competitors' vehicles and they felt like tin cans on wheels.   

My Civic has seen me through two winters so far and this car handles the snowy roads quite beautifully I must say. The Civic has just the right amount of weight and the all weather tires that come standard handled the snow very well. 

This model Civic is not for people who put a lot of stock in their cars; it is meant for people who need and are merely looking for inexpensive, comfortable, reliable transportation.. 

Some more random thoughts and comments on my Civic:

It has very comfortable seats. I am 6'1" and I have plenty of leg room and head room.  Also, the idle is very smooth and there is virtually no vibration in the car while the engine idles.  The vision out of all the windows is excellent. And, it comes standard with an anti-theft device. 

In addition to my comments above, I would like to add that my Civic is an auto-transmission and it shifts very smoothly. Almost unnoticeable.   The brakes are by far, the best I have experienced.  They appear to be electric assist, non ABS but are very reliable and provide very short stopping distance.  The back seat in the two door is surprisingly roomy for a 2-door car.  I am usually the one to drive all my friends around and none of them have a hard time getting in or out.  The back seat actually flips down to accommodate a large item in the trunk if need be and the trunk is deep and roomy!!  I can fit a ton of stuff in there!!    The controls are very user friendly and in close reach and clearly marked.   

If anyone is in the market today for a pre-owned Civic, I would highly recommend the '01 Honda Civic.  This car will not let you down.
