            I have owned a number of sports cars and found the looks of the Boxster and the image of porsche attractive.  After owning for two months I sold the car because my 4 door Maxima was more fun to drive.  What happened to porsche performance!  $50,000 to be beat by Honda S2000 and others!  I care more about a car than image.  I had hoped that the increase and torque for year 2000 would make a difference.  I should have read comparison on Edmonds.com roadsters.  The final straw was after only 2k miles, the hood of my ocean blue car looked like the milky way from all of the paint chips.  What happened to the 18 layers of paint on porsche!  The car was also the roughest riding sportscar I ever had with 18" wheels.  even on smooth highways the steering wheel vibrated and squeaks abounded! Yea, true porsche refinement.  This is a very competitive market, and porsche just did not measure up.  I have even heard other Boxster owners complain about the stereo quality, the plastic rear window, and the cost of options!  The cost of maintenance is $500 for 15,000 service that is only for oil change and inspections!  It's your money...
