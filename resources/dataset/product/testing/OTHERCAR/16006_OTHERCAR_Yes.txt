            No other car gave me a sense of a good purchase decision.  We all know cars depreciate, with the exception of the new VW Beetle one year after it hit pavement in America and a few other classic cars.  The case with today's auto purchase is the product is not designed to last 50 years like a '56 Ford T-bird.  Not too many people will look back in the year 2050 and say "wow...that 2001 Ford Escort was a beaut'" 

I have owned many cars over the years...ok want a list:
'60 VW bug (Last year manufactured with out a gas gauge...long stories of gas runs)
'73 VW bug
'73 VW bug Convertible
'84 Honda Prelude (Fast little Guy)
'84 Toyota Corona (Not a beer on wheels)
'84 Honda micro van (Nick named "ZIPPY"/had 10 inch wheels)
'87 Chev. Chevette (Pronounced "ShoveIt" or "Vette" depending on your pride of that thing.)
'90 Ford T-bird
'92 Toyota Tercel
'94 Toyota Corolla
'96 Toyota Camry
'96 Nissan Sentra
'99 Toyota Rav 4
'01 Toyota Camry (Current Garage Filler)

And that is only a 12 year span of owning cars.  Do see the trend.  I owned about 1 car for every year I drove one. Some of that had to do with moving around a lot.  But many people will own a few cars in a decade.  They trade or sell them because they stop working right or they get tired of the lack of comforts or for some other reason...but people are just not hanging on to cars.  However, in this recession we seem to be in, we are probably going to have to hold on a little longer than usual to our bigger ticket items.  Especially ones we need like a car.  

So it came down to this.  I need a good car that lasts a long time, is safe, gets great mileage, works all of the time, requires little maintenance and when I am through with it will aid in the purchase of my next car.   That is Camry.  For the money you can't beat it.  Many would say it is too expensive, but I have gone the less expensive route and it actually cost me more in the long and sometimes short run.  

I had to repair my own cars for the first few years because I had lack of funds to pay people.  I spent countless hours pulling VW engines and changing throw out bearing clips and bleeding brakes and the list just goes on.  With my Camry, and many new cars that is not even an option due to the nature of on board computers and so forth.  So, since the mechanics have to do the work I wanted to have to take it to them fewer times.  Camry has a suggested maintenance plan of every 5,000 miles rather than the usual 3,000.  This includes oil changes.  Don't beleive me?  Check the factory books on it.

The 4 cyl. engine sure doesn't feel like a normal 4.  I would say that you would feel a slight difference from a 4 and a 6 ... but folks ...the 4 is a great gas saver (28 mpg) but I can get up and go even with the AC running full blast!

I had one problem with a computer going out but the dealer replaced it and that computer did not prevent me from driving the car.  It is very reliable.

Resale value is a must.  I had the 96 Camry and in 2000 I traded it in for about 13000.

The comfort is much better than the Toyota of yester year.  If any of you ever rode in an early eighties Toyota Mini-Van, then you know Toyota was not the smoothest ride in the world.  But that has all changed now.  Unfortunately it is so much more comfortable than all of the other cars I have driven, I could fall a sleep.  (Don't worry...have not done that ...yet)

My wife is a safety nut.  This car has all of the right seatbelts and airbags to keep her satisfied. (Marriage counseling not provided with car or this article but the dealer will often try to lure her first :))

Camry is a tight car.  The doors are not heavy to close but they close tightly and outside noise is greatly reduced.  And they are not flimsy either.  None of the car rattles.  And for you VW Bug owners of the old school...you would probably miss that.  

So if you are like me and tired of having to deal with the up-keep of a car and need as little trouble as possible and want to make the purchase that has the potential of a high resale value, look at the Camry.  It just keeps getting better.  As for my 2001 ... I might just hold on to it for 6 years or longer.
