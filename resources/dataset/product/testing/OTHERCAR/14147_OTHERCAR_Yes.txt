            I first have to start off by saying that this was the cheapest camera that my parents and I could find for my High School graduation present.  We thought that it would be the best for me to just have a camera to point and shoot, and get mediocre quality pic to send with our emails to friends, but when we bought this camera we found that it was a whole lot more than "mediocre"!  

We bought the FinePix 1300 from compUSA when they had it on sale for only $149.99.  Again because of that low of a price I was even hesitant to get the camera because I thought that it may have been cheaply made.  I took it home and began to read the instructions immediatly.  The instruction manual is a very user friendly one that has good illustrations so that you will not get confused.  Any computer-illiterate person can understand how this camera works after reading these instructions.

Like I said earlier, I originally wanted this camera to put onto the internet and to send to friends, the FinePix 1300 allows you to easily do so even with the 8MB smart media card (included) it allows around 90 pictures to me taken before it is full.  This is a LOT of pictures when compared to the traditional non-digital camera.  Loading these pictures onto you computer at home is very easy.  Just install the software that the camera comes with which will allow you to view your pics the most efficiently, plug in your USB cable (also included), and your pictures should automatically pop up on your screen.  It is as easy as that.

This camera has  a manual and automatic mode when you are taking pictures.  This allows you to do many things with the camera.  For instance, if you want to adjust the shutter speed because of the less than adequete light around you, you can do so by switching to manual mode and then selecting the shutter speed option.  However, while in either of these two settings you can set the flash to do whatever you want it to do.  If you have even a little bit of light, you can take a picture of it with this camera.

I am very happy with this camera, because it is simple to use, and light to carry.  Because the batteries that it came with only lasted me about a day, I switched to rechargable NiCD's.  They last just a little shorter than the original batteries, but you can recharge them, so it doesn't matter really.  The only thing that I bought extra is another smart media card.  A 16MB and the original 8MB will let you take pictures till your heart is content.  If you have the camera on the low memory setting, a little over 200 pictures can be taken combined. :)

Now I know two other people with this camera, and we all live far from eachother, so with these cameras we can see eachother more than we should, now that we have the FinePix 1300.
