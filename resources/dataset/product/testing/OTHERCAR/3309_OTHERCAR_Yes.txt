            I think the first thing that should be said is, if you want a mini-van or sedan you shouldn't buy an SUV. Too many people want an SUV they can drive on the freeway, then complain that it doesn't handle like a sedan or accelerate like a sports car. This 4Runner wasn't created to hall soccer balls and cheerleaders. This year 4Runner is a good mix of reliability, durability, and function. I don't think it was ever intended to be a freeway racer or an economy commuter.

I bought my '95 4Runner in 1997 from a dealer in Oregon for 14k. Admittedly I spent some time (4 hrs) wearing them down on the price, but I was paying cash, so I don't think they wanted me to leave. I must also state that I actually went looking for a 4-cyl model without power windows, locks or a sunroof. Most people want all that stuff so a stripped 4-cyl was hard to find. For what I use my SUV for, I didn't want all the extras. The only option I made sure to get was A/C. (4 wheelin in the American desert can get a little warm.)

The power, or lack there-of, is still somewhat of an issue. I have tried to find ways of beefing-up the little 4 cylinder in order to eek out a few more horses, but I just couldn't trade the reliability for the couple more horses you get with the same year 6 cylinder. Besides, I heard from many sources, that the 1995 6 cylinder had some problems with warping heads.

Lastly, I've hauled everything from people to tools to shrubbery in my 4Runner and even towed another vehicle from Oregon to Utah. It didn't do it very fast but I ran the A/C all the way without so much as a millimeter of movement in the temperature guage. 75k miles later it still doesn't use oil or blow smoke. I also added a 'fold and tumble' Jeep seat to the cargo area for my kids to utilize. It's kinda' like a mini-suburban that seats 7.

The vehicle had 70K miles on it when I got it. I was told I was owner #2. The odometer now reads 161,475. I've driven it, (A/C blowing cold), between Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, and California. I have replaced the clutch, and speedometer cable. Other than those items, I have done nothing but oil changes, tires and tune-ups. That's it. I still drive it everyday and take it on long trips. I trust it like an old friend to get me where I'm going. That kind of reliability is worth twice what I paid. For some one who doesn't part with his money easily, there is no other vehicle for me.
