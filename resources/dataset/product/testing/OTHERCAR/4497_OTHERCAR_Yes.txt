            I am not able to drive anymore due to being handicapped but this vehicle is a dream come true for me.  My wife drives this van I get in the back and away we go.  This vehicle allows me to put my leg up and away we go to Florida and California.  It allows us plenty of room and comfort. 

 The gas mileage when loaded down is not all that great but the comfort makes up for it.  We purchased the vehicle new and have never had any repairs in the 80,000 plus miles.  We have made more trips in this vehicle than ever expected and love every minute of it.  We would never give this one up until we need to it is a dream car/van.  

My wife claims it handles as a car and parks like one as well.  The comfort is there for her.  I can have my own heat and ac as I need it on trips.  The next one will have a TV for me I know that.  

We love this van and know those who like to travel with kids or grandparents going to see their grandparents would love it as well.  Seats move out easily, allowing the rear seat to move up without a problem.<br><br>
