            It earned its keep on Christmas day and has been fun to play with since then.

I've used several very expensive digital cameras and their accompanying software through work, but this is definitely the right one for play time!  The others come with manuals -and you need them... I was taking pictures with this camera 15 minutes out of the box.  I then read the directions and the photos came out even better!  (I must be getting more like my husband)

Anyway, I found the icons on the camera back very easy to navigate and use.  I also appreciate that you can adjust the pixels from very good to super fine on the photos and can therefore take anywhere from 12 to around 50 photos, depending on what type of clarity you want.  The photos of the kids and pets came out just fine on the lower setting and I've taken some beautifully sharp shots of ice on trees on the higher settings.

Although the coloring wasn't great on some of the indoor shots, the software provided lets you lighten it up, adjust the hues and crop so that every picture can be perfect if you want to fuss with them at all.  (NOTE: I read some of the other epinions on this camera and several people complained about the skin tones.  If you play with the software a litte and have a photo you really want to print or blow up, you CAN make it beautiful without too much effort) Basic photo taking skills help too!

I can't say enough wonderful things about the software that comes with the Photomax.  There are two different programs, both are essentially the same but one is more "serious - business type".  The more user friendly version has most of the same features but in a much easier to use format.  I found both programs easier to use and comparable to expensive "professional" programs such as Adobe Photoshop, which I have used extensively. The software also includes a Fantasy Photo feature where you can put your photo in the Mona Lisa or back in black and white fifties style.  That alone was good for several hours of entertainment with the kids!

It's a great little camera for the price.  It does go through batteries pretty fast but I found that by using an extension cord indoors it saves batteries and money.  I'm considering buying some rechargeable batteries just to save a few bucks in the future.
