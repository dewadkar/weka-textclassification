            We helped our daughter by a new Kia sportage 98.. after a few months it was in the shop because on the freeway it would go into Neutral... can you imagine the accidents she was luckily  able to avoid...Kia kept trying to &quot;fix it&quot;,, but their comment was always &quot;we can't duplicate the problem&quot; and then they gave it back... it was in quite a few times....
 
THEN it began to actually turn OFF at stop lights or signs.... This is extremely dangerous, because another driver behind you wouldn't see your brake lights because you are now putting the car into park and stepping on the gas while starting the car again.... a definite accident waiting to happen.... It was in quite a few times for this.... Kia wouldn't do anything because they couldn't duplicate the problem.
  
During the times it was in we were told by a KIA rep that he had the same problem with his.. When we were told they did all they could do, and the Kia dealership wouldn't do anything else until it occurred more frequently, I told them i would refuse that my daughter drive a car that she could die in while they waited for it to happen more often.
  
At this point we went to the BBB and went through arbitration... the inspector only found at the time a low idle problem that could possibly be the problem and could be fixed.  Our local dealer wouldn't budge.  A few days later we got a call from KIA headquarters... they felt the car had been in the shop &quot;way too much time&quot; and they would replace it. They actually gave her a new 2000 Kia... thankfully she kept it for only a few months before trading it in for a 97 acura... (it was hard to find someone to trade it in to... she actually ended up at the original dealer that sold it to us)

Since we traded it in, we have gotten TWO recall notices... both state that they could &quot;cause injury or death to passengers or others&quot;.. had to to with stalling problems and then a brake line problem....(we had problems with the brakes too, replaced them when we had car for only 5 months.) 

I'm glad we got ours exchanged when we did,,, and weren't one of those that did have the &quot;accidents that did cause injury or death&quot;, that finally prompted KIA to do a recall!!!!
