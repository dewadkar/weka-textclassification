            I was tired of my head hitting the ceiling of my LS400, so I decided it was time to get a new car.  Being 6'4" and about 250 pounds I have real problems fitting in most cars comfortably.

I have always been an SUV kind of guy.  I have owned over the years 2 Jeep Wranglers, a Honda Passport, a Ford Expedition, and a Mercedes M-Class.  

The real question is, what type of SUV do I want?  I have always liked the Expedition.  It was very roomy and was still finished off nicely on the interior.  The Mercedes is a great car, but is still a little small.  I decided to go big, real big.  I didn't want a Suburban, and I really don't like the front grill of the new Escalade.  I was thinking about getting a Denali, but then I remembered a new Hummer was coming out.

So, Labor Day weekend I called up the local dealer and asked about the waiting list for it.  Since they had been announced a year ago I assumed it would take several months to get it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when they informed me they had several in stock to choose from.  Thirty minutes later I was pulling up to the dealership ready to be skeptical.

The demo model that was out front was a very nice burnt orange (The color is really not bad at all.).  At first site the thing look absolutely enormous.  It is a man's man car.  I could feel Tim Allen starting to seep out of my body as I stuck my nose to the window like a 5 year old looking into a candy store.  Without driving it I new this was the car for me.

The salesman comes out and I try to play it cool.  I needed my wife's help getting my jaw off the ground and my tongue back in my mouth.  We decided to take this baby out for a spin.  Did I mention the car was big?  It is narrower then the original Hummer, but still 6" wider then a GMC Yukon.  Getting in was an easy task and the view of the road was great.  The engine fired right up and you could hear the 6 liter V8 just gurgling to life.  I could already feel my gas bill getting higher and higher.  It is a little freaky to drive until you get used the large dimensions.  After about 5 minutes you are ready to run a slalom course.  It is very comfortable and the seats are nicely supportive.  It has 8 way power seats and four way lumbar controls.  It doesn't real cut through the wind as much as it pushes the wind aside.  Some noise at 75 mph, but what do you expect?  It's not like it is a Benz. It drives much smaller then you would think. Acceleration is adequate and you just tower over everyone.  It can tow up to 8000 pounds.(Looks like it is time to get a boat.)
After the test drive I went to the back of the dealership to pick out my car.  They were out of the Lux package which comes with a sunroof and some chrome pieces and such, but no biggie.  I picked up a Pewter adventure package, they pretty much order them all the same way with some minor differences.  It was a nicely loaded out H2, heated leather front and rear seats(There is only one interior color choice.), in dash 6 dish changer, onstar, brush guard, rear tail light guard, light rack on the top, third row seat, and it has an air compressor built in the back.  Never know when you might have to air up the old Mountain Bike tires.

The amount of storage space in the rear is a little on the small side if you choose to keep the full size spare inside the H2.  They make a tire rack for the back, but at $1500 I could live without it.  The H2 seats five adults very comfortably.  The third row could work in a pinch, but I wouldn't want to put an adult back there for an extended period of time.

I think Pewter is the best color.  All the other colors seem to hide the lines of the H2.  Plus my buddy pointed out the Pewter is about as close as one can get to a military color with what is offered.

I guess the coolest thing about the H2 is the way it makes anybody that has ridden in it feel.  We all feel like we are 18 again.  I have never seen so many stares, finger points, dropped jaws, and cat calls in any car I have ever owned.  That includes the 911 Turbo convertible.  I think the greatest reaction is from small children.  Their eyes open real wide, their jaw drops, and they all point.  I think they believe we are being invaded.

Now to get to the title of the review.  My friends and I have been racking our brains trying to figure out what to call the H2.  It isn't a car, and truck doesn't seem to fit.  Our UPS driver called it a rig and I think that works for the time being.

Bottom line.  If you are looking for a new SUV, buy this one.  You won't regret it.
