            The PowerShot A50's combination of features, size, value and more is a winner for the $300-400 digital camera range. It's not the absolute killer of a machine, but it's quite satisfactory to the beginning to intermediate digital photographer.

It's <b>price</b>, which has fallen $50 since I bought it two months ago, is very respectable. It's very easy to overpay, however; be sure to use mysimon.com or dealtime.com to find the best price. I find it a much better deal than most of the equivalent cameras in the same range, all of which seem to miss one or two features, such as zoom or resolution, that the A50 has.

It's on the large end of <b>pocket-sized</b>. I admit I imagined it would be a mite smaller and lighter than it is, but that's due to clever photographic angles like the one on the picture on this page. It's thicker than it looks! I strongly recommend buying the <b>case</b> which runs from $15-20. It's a nice, velvety texture with a little space for squeezing in a spare battery and memory card (more on that later).

It's <b>photo quality</b> highly depends on the resolution. 640x480 is fine for squeezing either 120 or 60 shots on an 8 MB card (depending on high or normal quality; normal looks blotchy and weird), but is disappointing colorwise. Shiny objects, and especially thin white lines, have surreal green and purple tones. On the other hand, high resolution at 1280x960 is really beautiful most of the time. I've also found it has a slight fish-eye effect on close objects.

<b>Taking pictures</b> is a skill that takes practice. The camera may take one or two seconds after pressing the button to take the picture, so be sure to hold your hand steady for a few seconds. If you turn beeping off (I do because it would otherwise beep at every press of any button), it's nearly impossible to hear the three faint clicks of the process. To be absolutely sure that a picture's been taken, wait for about five seconds and a green light should flash in the viewfinder. Alas, motion photography really is poor, unless you like blurs; most digital cameras suffer this malady. And the red-eye reduction does barely anything.

You can also use the <b>LCD screen</b> as a viewfinder, but unless you've got the rechargeable battery it's a real energy waste. The screen is good and bright, and fun to use to show off your pictures to friends. Turn the dial to Play to see them.

The <b>zoom</b> isn't all that powerful at 2x, but it really makes a difference. It's also a true optical and not a digital zoom, which makes for better photo quality. I've entertained myself for minutes on end turning the camera on and off to watch the strange and fascinating way in which the door slides away and the lens comes to life.

One of the great benefits of digital cameras is <b>viewing your pictures</b> without developing them. With the ample <b>screen</b> on the back (on which it's very easy to get noseprints from holding the camera to your eye), you can look at the pictures you've taken and delete the ones you don't like. (One reviewer complained about the difficulty of deleting pictures, but there's a shortcut: when viewing a picture, hold down the Set and - (minus) buttons. Then arrow to OK.) With the <b>video cable</b> you can display your shots on a TV, a much easier way to present to a large group. It's also easy to <b>download to a computer</b>: cables are included for both PC and Mac (yay!). Avoid the evil and incomprehensible Time Tunnel software; instead use the plugin for Adobe PhotoDeluxe (included with the A50) or Photoshop (my favorite program!). To get prints on photographic paper, use shutterfly.com, ofoto.com or photoaccess.com. All of them offer some arrangement for free prints!

<i>Strong recommendations</i>

<b>Battery:</b> The PowerShot line uses a strange Lithium battery called 2CR5, which costs around $12 in most stores, is not rechargeable, and wears out after about 250 pictures and 30 minutes of screen use combined. It cannot take AAs. But do not fear! There are two solutions:
1. Get the rechargeable battery pack. It's expensive ($80), strange, and the Nickel Metal Hydride battery weighs noticeably more than the 2CR5. However, it's worth it. It pays itself off over time for not having to buy batteries, and it's much nicer on our environment. You'd throw out 200 lithium batteries by the time your NiMH one wears out.
2. If you insist on buying throwaways, or want some spares for a long trip, you can do much better than $12. Search for &quot;2cr5&quot; on eBay and you'll find a variety of deals at around $4-5 a battery. Or send an email to Jerry Watterson at ptron1@hotmail.com, from Sunn Battery in Jacksonville, FL, or fax 904-358-7753. I swear I'm not being paid; I was just very happy with the service.

<b>Memory Card:</b> The 8MB CompactFlash card included with the camera will get you around 23 shots at Large High Quality, the setting you should use for most shots. I strongly recommend at least another 8MB card or larger. I used a $10 coupon at http://www.flamingoworld.com for buy.com, and landed an 8MB card from IBM for a total of $21. See what deals you can find.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The PowerShot A50 Zoom is a good machine. It is not without its shortcomings, but goes a long way for the price. I have been very satisfied, and I wholeheartedly recommend at the very least a good look into it by any buyer in the sub-$500 price range.<br><br>
