            I've always loved the Neon.  When it first came out on the market, I decided that this car was for me.  And finally, I bought the 2000.  I do not regret it.  It is a cute car.  It has a slight aerodynamic look.  The headlights add to it's personality.  Despite the fact that it is a small car, it is quite roomy. The seats are comfortable--even on the long rides. There is no longer the whipping wind sound as reported from the earlier Neons. It rides smooth and has pick up.  There are a couple of drawbacks.  They don't bother me; however, other people have mentioned them to be quite cumbersome.  The front-end is short.  If there ever was a front end collison, the Neon would be totaled.  The back end is slightly high, which could cause slight problems when backing up.  Other than that, I find that for a young woman buying her first car, this was a choice I am proud of.  <br><br>
