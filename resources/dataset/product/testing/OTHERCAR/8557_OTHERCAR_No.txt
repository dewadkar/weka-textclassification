            Where do I start? Just typing this my blood is boiling. I bought this car in 1994 new as my first car. I was 18 years old. I really love the way the car drove and it felt sporty. 

:: sigh :: it was ok the first 36k miles. Unfortunately I didn't buy the extended warranty. The following year (less than 2 years old) it all started going down hill.

The flasher went out and from then on I have had weird problems with the lights. Occasionally my ABS light will come on and it's tied in to the turn signal. When my lights are on at night the turn signal light (not the turn signal itself) will stay on. If I turn on the flashers the ABS light comes on. And the scariest part: the dash lights will just go off and it will go totally dark in the car and freak you out while you are driving as it catches you off guard. The gas gauge is also affected and jumps around frantically.

Next problem: The steering column. The horn area has the Pontiac symbol on it. The apparently wasn't molded well and it has split all the way down the side of the symbol...creating about a 1/4&quot; gap as it constricts and swells with the heat/cold. This allows you to see down into the airbag area. It's been this way for about 4 years and hasn't done anything major but it's scary and will need to be replaced before I can sell the car.

The car leaked like a convertible for a while. We couldn't figure out HOW the water was getting in. Everytime it rained water would be sloshing in the car and this resulted in mold forming under the carpet. I even had mechanics looking at it and they couldn't figure it out. Finally through process of elimination, including replacing the trunk seal for $50 that had rotted due to all the water, we realized it was a bad seal around the back tail light. My husband caulked all around it and that fixed that problem. 

Let's see everything that happened within the first two years I owned it: Had to replace the alternator, alternator belt. The automatic lock quit working on the passenger side. The wiper blade transmission went (the plastic gears wore down) and the wipers wouldn't work. That was $100 for that part and my husband replaced it. 

I've had to replace the knobs on the AC when the plastic cracked. The dash rattles terribly.

The AC quit working last summer. The heat defroster quit working which we since had fixed. The latch that allows the seat to be adjusted broke.

The biggie: I had to replace the engine this past year just as I paid the car off, so I had to refinance it. These engines are NOT cheap and cost over $3k for a rebuilt engine/labor, and yes I called around to ALOT of places.
I was told on more than one occasion that these engines have a very bad reputation. The engine only had around 115,000 miles at the time. I had also gotten a tune up on it a few months earlier and spent several hundred dollars replacing this boot thing (I forget the exact part) that had scorch marks on it and the mechanic told me they had tech notes on that part because it was known to have alot of problems.

I've replaced the clutch at a cost of around $900 but I'm sure I would have had to do that as a routine wear and tear expense.

I'm very bummed I've had these problems because this car means alot to me, being my first car and all. But I really wish I could trade this car in. But now I owe on it again with the engine and it needs SO many things repaired that I can't afford being a stay at home mom. So I guess we are stuck with it and will drive it until it completely dies. Hopefully we will be able to at least get the electrical problem fixed since I'm scared to even drive the car with that problem.

One other downside I didn't notice when I bought it is the lack of head room in the front. I'm only 5' 4&quot; so it didn't bother me but my 6' DH has to lean the seat back a bit to fit.

Let me summarize this way: I will NEVER EVER buy another Pontiac EVER. I would not recommend this car to anybody. I would even feel guilty selling it off to some poor soul.<br><br>
