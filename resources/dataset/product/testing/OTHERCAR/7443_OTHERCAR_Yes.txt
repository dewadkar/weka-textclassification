            I searched for a long time and looked at several different kinds of sports cars when i was looking for a new vehicle. I had not even given any thought or in fact even noticed the Grand Am's when I was on my hunt. Well, when my choices were narrowing down, I happened to come across Long Pontiac in Chattanooga, TN. I saw a black car sitting in the middle of the parking lot kinda by itself, therefore standing out. The reason I went to look at it first was because it looked pretty sharp, it was black with 16 inch aluminum wheels, and low profile tires, but I wasnt sure what it was just yet. I began to check it out, look at the interior and so forth and started to realize what a sharp car it was. I finally took it for a test drive, and as soon as i finished my drive i was in love. There wasnt anything that I didn't like about the car. It was comfortable, it had every option possible. The powered sunroof was a great sporty touch. The factory stereo system was amazing. It contains a am/fm and cd player with the 7 band graphic eaqualizer. It came with the 6 speaker system with a subwoofer as well.  The handling was also incredible. I looked at the price which was a little steep, but I believe it was well worth the purcahse in the end. I dont think there was anything the I didn't like about the car. When you look at the motor performance, it performs excellent for a V6. I have the 3400 V6 GT Ram Air model, and it is amazing how much power and performance you get from the V6. It also gets good gas mileage as well, so its great for traveling too. As far as the interior goes, it was more stylish and aerodynamic than any car I had owned, or seen before. There is a small extra this car has that not many people would notice or pay attention to in a car and it is a battery run down system. This is a sensor where if anything in your car that runs off the battery has been left on once the ignition is off, it waits a certain amount of time, then shuts itself off, therefore you can never have a dead battery. I think this is a great quality of the car, although maybe not noticed by most car buyers. Another great quality this car has is space. I looked at several 2 door sports cars and there was none that had the space and comfort of a 2 door car as the Grand Am did. It has plenty of room for me, and meets all my needs. I probably wouldn't suggest the 2 door as a family car, but the 4 door grand am series would be a great choice for a family car, and I would highly suggest anyone owning one!<br><br>
