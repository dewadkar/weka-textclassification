            My husband is a truck man!  When he had an accident a couple of years ago, he was in a 91 dodge ram truck.  If he had been in a car, he would have been seriously injured.  

We had to find another truck for him, immediately.  He looked at a Chevy, they just didn't drive well.  He decided to look at another Dodge.  The Ram drove wonderfully.  The ride was quiet and there was room for our kids with the Club Cab.  The only draw back with that truck was the kids had to climb over the front seat to get to the back.  Dodge heard our complaints!!!  And we didn't even tell them!  

When Dodge came out with the Quad Cab my husband started to drewl.  It was just what we needed.  Now with our '99 Quad Cab, we can haul just about anything, including our kids!  The ride is quiet, smooth and it drives like a dream.  That means I don't mind taking the truck now and then.  

The only draw back with this truck is that it sits high off the ground because of the 4x4 option.  Getting in and out can be tricky.  The gas mileage isn't the best at 10 miles per gallon.  But once we have a few more miles on it, I believe the mileage will improve.  

We've taken this truck on trips and it performed wonderfully.  There's plenty of room to stretch on those long rides.<br><br>
