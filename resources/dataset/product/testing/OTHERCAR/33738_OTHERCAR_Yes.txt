            In the year that I've owned my 1995 Nissan Maxima, I've had more fun driving than I did in three years of driving my 1992 Plymouth Voyager. And I had a lot of fun in that car, but it mostly involved doing donuts and smashing into shopping carts.

I purchased this car after my minivan died. My mom is a worrywart, so she wanted me to have a safe, reliable car. The Maxima is very safe from my experience; the mirrors and windows provide excellent visibility.  It also has enough horsepower for me to get on the busy expressway without being rear ended. Additional safety is provided by two airbags, one for a front passenger and one for the driver.

Riding in a Maxima isn't only safe, it's comfortable! The driver's power seat and the passenger's seat are both leather and have warmers. In addition, the driver's seat has a control to adjust its firmness for lumbar support. There is ample room for my legs in the Maxima (however, I'm only 5'5", so I'm not sure how larger people will do) and there is a small part of the floor that is raised and fits my idle left foot perfectly. On long, two-hour trips from Chicago to central Illinois, I am perfectly comfortable.

One of the best things about the Maxima is its temperature controls. The two modes, "Auto" and "Econ", once set to the desired temperature, will continually adjust the blower's strength until the car is just how you like it. You can also adjust the blower's strength manually.
If you feel like getting fresh air, four power windows are easily controlled, as well as the power sun and moon roof. The roof can either be rolled back or just slightly tilted up. It moves into position quickly and quietly.

This Nissan also has plenty of space for hauling stuff around. The spacious trunk and back seat are connected by a lockable pass-through which can be revealed by folding down part of the seat. The center console has a spot to stash cassette tapes or cigarettes, as well as an ashtray and cup holders. The cup holders are square shaped and fit most glasses and cans, but won't fit plastic bottles or anything larger. They are well placed behind the leather-wrapped shifter and don't get in the way. Behind the cup holders, there is an additional storage area that can fit plenty of CDs and other stuff. I keep my owner's manual, a 20 CD case, and a few books in mine with room to spare.

The Bose stereo system with both CD and cassette provides awesome six-speaker sound. My only complaint is that the CD player won't work in extreme temperatures. What I mean by this, is if the Maxima has been sitting out overnight in freezing weather, it rejects the CDs and says there is an error. This does not happen if the Maxima has been in the garage overnight.

For a luxury, V-6 car with 90,000 miles on it, the Maxima gets pretty good mileage. In my experience, it gets about 23 in city driving and around 27 on the highway.

I have had a few problems with the Maxima in the year I've owned it. One was a fuel injector failure that resulted in a rough idle and lackluster acceleration (and a $400 bill to fix it). According to my mechanic, this problem is all too common in Nissans.
It also had something wrong with its computer that resulted in it not being able to start. My mechanic bypassed it so that it would start, but at the expense of the power locks NOT working when the ignition was off. This has been kind of annoying but better than paying the $900 to fix it.
