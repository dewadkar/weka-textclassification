            I've always been a Chevy fan.  Their cars took a nose dive a long time ago and I switched to Honda.  The trucks took a little longer to decline but after owning this truck I'm done with GM.  My problems may be due to my truck being used when I bought it, many people have wonderful opinions of these trucks.

I bought a 1997 GMC Sierra K1500 SLT Extended Cab Z71 (what a mouth full) in September of 2002 with 68K miles.  The truck that it replaced was a 1989 Chevy C1500 regular cab that had 170K miles on it.  I'd had such good luck with my first truck that I didn't even cosider anything but GM when I decided to replace it.  My brother is still driving my old truck, nearly 190K and no problems!

<b>1997 K1500</b>
The SLT package is loaded.  My truck had leather, power everything (even seats), a third door, 5.7 liter engine, push button 4WD.  It really was a step up in the luxuries department.  Maybe I fell in love with it because it made my old '89 look so dated.  The 5.7 liter (350 cid) "Vortec" engine was noticeably more powerful than my old Throttle Body Injected (TBI) 350.  

<b>Exterior</b>
The 88-99 GM trucks are "boxy" but there is something about that look that I like.  My truck was black (top) and silver (bottom below trim), the paint was in very good shape with only a few scratches in it's 5 year life.  There was no noticeable oxidation or peeling except for one spot on the grill.  The paint seemed to resist chips much better than the older models.

My truck had the "wideside" or normal style bed wherein the wheel wells are inside the bed.  There was adequate room for my 4 wheeler and plenty of other hunting equipment, a drastic increase in capacity from my old stepside bed.  The GM trucks didn't come with any anchor points in the bed.  All you have are several holes in the bed rail where you can hook a tie down, it would have been nice to have some anchor points lower in the bed a la Toyota.  The tailgate supports were cables that are notorious for rusting and breaking, my older truck had folding steel hinges that would not break (under reasonable stress). The tailgate handle trim ring would not stay in place.  It was not a big deal most of the time, but indicative of the lack of quality of the truck.

<b>Interior</b>
I really like the dash layout in the GM trucks.  The only thing that I really don't care for is the location of the radio, of course it is convenient for the driver.  My truck had the cassette radio with optional CD player.  The location of the CD player was right behind the gear shift (automatic) when the truck was in drive... annoying!

The gauges are big, well thought out, and easy to read.  The fuel gauge is only a best guess (most are) and since this truck has no fuel light it's best to refuel well before the gauge hits the red.  By '97 other manufacturers were using digital trip/odometers.  GM still used the analog style, it seems to fit in nicely with the analog gauge package overall so I didn't mind that part.

My truck had power everything so it was nice to see that GM had decided to relocate the window and door lock controls since 1989.  The controls are mounted on the door armrest and they are lighted so you don't have to feel around in the dark.  All of my power accessories worked flawlessly.

Leather upholstery was not my first choice, however the leather bucket seats in my truck were some of the most comfortable I've seen.  The driver's seat was completely adjustable and with the built in armrest you could just relax on long trips.  The passenger seat would only move forward and back, but it also reclines so your traveling companion can nap if he/she wishes.  The rear seat LOOKS like it would have a lot of room and it does have plenty of shoulder and hip room.  The leg room is almost non existant though.  I'm not a tall person (5'10") but with the driver's seat adjusted for me comfortably there is no way somone my height could sit behind me.  

The only real downfall of the interior is the cheap, brittle plastic that GM uses.  Granted, mine had some age on it, and my other truck suffered from the same problem.  The plastic parts are just too brittle.  Take the dash apart once to install speakers or a new radio and you'll find out just how brittle the plastic is.  The adjusters in the vents will break right off in your hand!

Finally the interior has so many squeaks and rattles that I gave up trying to locate them.  The third door always rattles when you hit any sort of bump.  There is some sort of squeaking coming from the plastic panel behind the rear seat.  The driver's seat ALWAYS squeaks and there are numerous creaks from the dash.

<b>Engine/Drivetrain</b>
The 5.7 liter engine is THE GM small block.  It is a reliable and powerful engine, even more so with the Vortec heads.  Other than the water pump I never had to do anything  to the engine other than routine maintenance.

Transmission - my 4 speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly and pulled fine.  It did sometimes "clunk" from first to second.  These truck are NOTORIOUS for loosing the transmission somewhere between 80K and 100K.  It's some sort of electronic switch inside that cost like $50, but once it goes out it's $900 to fix the stuff it breaks!  I got rid of mine before that happened to me!

The pushbutton 4WD transfer case worked flawlessly.  It made a lot of noise going into 4 low, but the truck never failed to go into 4WD and it always pulled with authority.  I believe it would go just about anywhere!  I did develop some leaks around the front axles where they go into the transfer case.

The downside to all that power is gas mileage... or lack thereof.  I averaged 14mpg and never got more than 16 on the highway.  Towing 3 motorcycles to Tennessee, I got a whopping 12mpg!  

<b>Summary</b>
So why do I dislike this truck?  It never broke down, it never got stuck, and it had plenty of power.  I can't put my finger on any one thing.  I was scared to death that the transmission was going to fall out of it for one.  The squeaks and rattles were too numerous to ever find and overall I was very unhappy with the quality of the truck.  I think that GM built that truck to last for 5 years and get traded.  I am well aware that it could have been abused by the previous owner, however, it showed no signs of any kind of mis use and still rattled like a 69 Volkswagen Beattle.  If I'm going to make payments on something it's not going to annoy me to drive it!

I'm buying a Toyota.  The Tundra is built in Indiana and is a MUCH better quality vehicle that suits my needs.
