            The first vehicle we test drove before buying a new SUV was the Sorento.  Because of its total package (warranty, styling, luxury package, etc.) and affordable pricing, we set it as the standard for all others to beat.

Next, we test drove the GMC Envoy, Nissan Murano, Toyota Highlander, and Honda Pilot.  My wife also drove her friend's Hyundai Sante Fe.  In our opinion, the only one that came close to the Sorento was the Nissan Murano.  

I've always heard people refer to driving certain vehicles as "fun."  I truly love my full-size quad-cab pickup, but it's not what I'd call "fun to drive."  In fact, I had never driven a car that was "fun" until the Sorento.  It is a blast to zip around in. (The Murano was, too.)

The interior of our 2WD EX (with optional luxury package and ABS) is loaded.  We love all the storage compartments, sun roof, and radio controls on the steering wheel.  This is a very solid, well-built vehicle, and it's quiet inside.  The attention to detail in the assembly and workmanship is superb.  Even the doors have a solid luxury-car feel about them when they close.

We highly recommend the Sorento. It was the ideal SUV for us (It's only fair to point out that we did not need or want a third row of seats.) The only option I wish it had was a 2-driver position switch to store different mirror and seat position settings. 

Update 15 December 2003:  My wife travels quite a bit, and she has put a little over 8,000 miles on her Sorento in only 5 months.  To date, we have had ZERO problems...not even a rattle!  This vehicle is as solid as the day we drove it off the lot.  We both still really enjoy driving it, and the gas mileage has actually slightly improved over time.  Just last week our neighbor bought a 2004 Sorento.  I am positive she will be happy with it.  I feel like this is one of the best investments we've ever made.  You just can't beat the style, quality, ride, and comfort for the price.  And our Kia dealership takes GREAT care of us...even better than the Lincoln-Mercury-Dodge dealership where I take my new truck for service. I still recommend the Kia Sorento 110%.
