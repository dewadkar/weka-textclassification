            This is a car that I bought for my wife, who is new to this country and not a confident driver.  She went for it right away, compared with some other cars, because it was very easy to see in all directions from the drivers' seat (she is 5'2").  This is not something you take for granted, as many of today's cars have curvy sheet metal and fadeaway fenders that make it difficult to see where the back of the car ends, an advantage when you're trying to back out.  Also, the Civic, though a relatively inexpensive model, has very good build quality and finish, so it doesn't look like a cheap car.  

ENGINE AND DRIVETRAIN:  We got the EX 4-door automatic model.  The EX comes with the 127 HP VTEC engine, which has a bit more zip than the other version.  It also comes with antilock brakes standard (I am not sure if the DX and LX models offer that as an option). You do have to mash the accelerator a bit for high speed passing, and being a small four cylinder engine, it will be more noisy than a large six.  The 4-speed automatic with lockup converter does downshift a bit late.  Under the hood, it is easy to check levels of coolant, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, brake cylinder fluid, windshield washer fluid, and engine oil. 

SEATING:  Seats are upholstered in a comfortable, durable cloth, with matching inserts in the doors. The driver's seat, though manually operated, has height and angle adjustments for part that you sit on, in addition to the reclining seatback. This makes it relatively easy to find a position you are comfortable with.  Rear seating is actually quite roomy for a car of this class. 

INSTRUMENTS & CONTROLS: Instruments are easy to read.  The heater & A/C controls are well-placed in the driver's normal field of vision and simple to operate as well. There is also a small slot for about 3 CDs right below the sound system panel. However, the standard sound system (with the CD), doesn't have particularly good sound.  Aftermarket speakers may improve the quality, in my opinion.  

CONVENIENCE FEATURES:  Storage areas include map pockets in each of the front doors, cupholders in front of the shifter, and a small box under the armrest between the front seats.  Hood and trunk releases are at the driver's side on the floor.  The trunk release is lockable for security.  The rear seats are split-foldable, in case you want to carry large cargo. The rear seats are also lockable for security as well.  

EXTERIOR:  Low sloping hood provides good visibility to the front.  The notchback design also makes it easy to see the back as well.  Tasteful, no-nonsense look (for the sedan). The modest exterior dimensions and straightforward lines make it easy to park and maneuver, a virtue in urban areas. The Vintage Plum color, I believe, is a new one for the Y2000.   

VALUE:  The Civic has a well-deserved reputation for reliability. The car has been trouble-free in 18 months of ownership.  Civics seem to have a low rate of depreciation---we were looking at getting a 2-3 year old car, but the prevailing prices of late model used cars told us that it would only cost about $1000 more to get a new car, and we did. It's not a posh luxury model, and you won't get neck-snapping acceleration (at least for the stock version; where we live, Civics are popular models for custom modification and there are many aftermarket parts available).  But what you will get is a solid, daily driver that will take you from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss and won't drain your bank account in keeping it running. I've heard that the new redesigned Y2001 model has taken out the double wishbone suspension and left out a few other things in the interest of keeping costs down, so if you're in the market for a Civic, take note.
