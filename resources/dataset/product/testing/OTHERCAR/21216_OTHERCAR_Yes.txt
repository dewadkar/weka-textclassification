            This car really has it all.  I am truly amazed that for under twenty five thousand dollars that a car like this fine automobile can be obtained.

First of all let me start out by saying that this is a fairly stylish machine.  Granted, it's not going to replace porsche anytime soon as the best looking car on the road; however, I have already received compliments on the looks of my new Camry.

Secondly, this is a very safe car.  The manufacturers have gone above and beyond the given standards for crash-testing and have made sure to leave no stone unturned in the area of safety.  This would be a great reason for a family with small children to look into buying this vehicle.  Even more than just the statistics on crash tests, it is easily to see that the car is made well just by looking at it and road testing it a few times.

The third reason that I love this car is the fact that it offers a very smooth ride.  It really does feel as though you are riding on air and the shocks do a wonderful job of absorbing impact.  Anyone with hip or lower back problems would certainly find the Camry to be a Godsend.  

The fourth great feature about this car is the price.  For under $25,000 this car can be obtained loaded with most features at most dealerships. For this money there really is no equal.  

Basically, what I am trying to say is that if you want the quality of a Mercedes and a car that also is eye-catching, the Toyota Camry can't be beat for the price.<br><br>
