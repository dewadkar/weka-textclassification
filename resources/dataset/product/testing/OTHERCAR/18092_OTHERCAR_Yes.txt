             I have driven a neon for three years, I found the abundence of aftermarket parts and proformance parts a big plus. In the relm of small cars, it is hard to find good horsepower and torque. But with about a thousand dollars and a few weekends, you can get great speed out of the neons fore cilinder engin. the stock airbox and pully system are easly removed and it is cheep to find and quick to install. this is a car renound for its handiling so that is not an issue.The price of this car is resonable and the interor is roomy but noise.A good value all around.<br><br>
