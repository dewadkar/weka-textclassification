            I've always wanted a convertible, and since I really like fast cars, I decided to try out this one. 

I'd heard the Honda S2000 has a top speed of around 150mph, which, I always think is a good thing. So it sounded like the ideal car that would be a lot of fun to drive. 150 top speed normally means very fast acceleration. Well, that happens to be somewhat true. It's pretty quick. After having tried this, I went and looked up that it does the 0-60 in just under 6 seconds. Which translates into only a second faster than my current car, so I was only marginally impressed. But the acceleration in the S2000 feels much faster than 6 seconds. This car will snap you back into the seat when stomping on the accelerator. Always a plus in my book.

<b>The engine-</b>
240 horsepower also sounds pretty nice, what is amazing is this is out of a 4 cylinder, Honda has many years of experience in race car engine development, this engine no doubt came out of that engineering. This car actually will rev up to almost 9000 RPM. Most production engines will blow at that rpm, 9000 actually seems like a scary number to bring a car up to, but this is a Honda after all, a company known for its' reliability. Granted with a car one year old longevity and durability cannot be known, but one can rely somewhat on the past history of Honda as building a lasting engine. The engine is a dual overhead cam VTEC, aluminum engine actually. The transmission is only a 6 speed manual. I happen to like automatics, especially when driving through the city, but this manual transmission is kind of fun. Perhaps it is the novelty to me of a 6 speed. 

<b>Handling-</b>
Unreal. Throw the S2000 into anything you want to. It shall remain on the road. (At least in dry weather, I didn't try this, nor would I recommend it, on wet pavement) The ride is great for feeling the road, as a little sportscar should be like. But this isn't always the greatest thing when driving in Rhode Island, as Rhode Island's Department of Transportation appears to take pride in poorly maintained roads. The handling really is impressive. Honda says this is from the almost perfect 50/50 weight split of the car. The suspension is a double wishbone independent, and it certainly works well.

<b>Interior-</b>
Well, lets say the back seat sure stinks. In fact, there is no back-seat. This is a 2 seat car. Front seats, decent room, excellent leg room, and you are seated down low in the car.

License and Registration Please.
OK, so chances are I'd get stopped for speeding in this car. I'd have to get out and reach into the storage place behind the seats. Why? Because there isn't a glove box in the dashboard. Is that bizarre or what? I thought my current glovebox was small, I had no idea someone would build a car without one.

<b>Instruments-</b>
It's digital. GRRRR! I dislike digital. You can't watch a needle go spinning past numbers. 

<b>Gentlemen- Start your engines!</b>
Turn the key? Nah, that would be boring. Insert key, push button to the left of the steering wheel. Push button start, like a race car! Cool. Way Cool. This should be an option on all cars.

Cup Holder!
Yes, the S2000, unlike my car, HAS a cup holder. It's the little things in life.

<b>Looks-</b>
This car looks like it's competition. It looks much like a BMW Z3 roadster had sex with a Mazda Miata, and out popped the S2000. I'm not impressed by the looks. It was the power I was interested in.

<b>Wheels-</b>
16 inch wheels, wider in the back, which means thou shalt not rotate thy tires.

<b>Fuel Economy-</b>
Said to be 20 city, 26 highway. Now on the surface that doesn't sound like much, but in a 240 horsepower sportscar? Sounds good to me.

<b>Brakes-</b> 
Anti-lock brakes, all the cool kids put anti-lock brakes in their cars these days. These brakes also slow this car down very fast. You want brakes like this. You won't bang into things as easily.

<b>Taking the top off-</b>
Taking the top off is always a good thing. The faster you can get the top down, the better, how does 6 seconds sound? You just undo a couple of clips and push a button. Down it goes. You can do this while waiting at a red light. Sadly, the convertible's rear window is plastic. 

<b>The ride-</b>
It's loud. You've got a tiny engine running on average around 5000 rpm. You can hear it. Turn the radio up (standard with a CD player) and you can drown out the sound, but then you're blasting your radio and ruining your hearing. Now try talking to your one passenger, you'll need to speak UP! The stereo isn't great when cranked up. You may want to replace it with better speakers or something. (Below in the select ride menu, the choice chosen is "Good, relatively quiet ride" this is because the car itself doesn't rattle and squeak)

<b>SAFETY-</b>
Dual airbags. This is a good thing, but you can't shut off the right passenger side one. Since there is some evidence of airbags killing kids and small people, if you fall into one of those two groups, don't ride in this car. Or, if you do, stab the dash where you think the airbag is. This will probably annoy the owner of the car, but you just can't put a price on your own life. A real friend would understand.

The Chassis is some new one called a high X-bone. This somehow makes a convertible as rigid and stable as a car with a hardtop. It also is said to be excellent in a crash.

<b>Trunk Space-</b>
This is not the car you are going to store a couple of bodies in. In fact, the trunk is downright small. The Dodge Neon has more room.

<b>The Price!</b>
So, this is Honda's answer to the BMW Z3 and the Porsche Boxster, it is priced accordingly. This car is supposed to be $32,000 new. The used one I found was priced at $32,000. Apparently they don't depreciate after 7,000 miles. No, that can't be it. Dealers are doing what they did with the VW Bug, and the PT Cruiser, jacking up the price because the car is hard to find. Those dirty capitalists! The nerve of them.

$32,000 is absolutely ridiculous. Considering you can get the same speed out of a cheaper Camaro Z-28 SS, and older 5.0 Mustangs will beat the S2000 in a drag race. If you want performance, and have $32,000, the Pontiac Firebird with WS6 Ram Air package is much better. That will get you 320 horsepower, and even better gas mileage, and you can get that in a convertible, with a Glass window.

Overall, the S2000 is a car one will get because one has some money, and wants to be the only one on the block with one of these. It's overpriced for what it is. Do I recommend it? Yes, if you have $32,000 sitting around and can't figure out what to do with it.
