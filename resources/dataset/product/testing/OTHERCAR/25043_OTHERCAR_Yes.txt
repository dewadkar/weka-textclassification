            The instant you pick up the Kodak DC-4800, you realize this camera will soon be the benchmark others will be measured against. There are a lot of more than 3 megapixel cameras coming on the market now, but this camera won't get lost in the herd, once the word gets out. 

This camera is more of a &quot;photographer's camera&quot; than a computing tool. I like it much better than the popular DC 280. For one thing, the lens cap stays on, even when the lens is extended.

The DC4800 handles like an analog camera which, in my view, isn't a bad thing. The placement of the knobs and dials are in logical places. Unlike a lot of digital cameras, which require you to punch through menu upon menu of LCD screens just to change the exposure, this camera has nice clear knobs and dials.

The zoom lens is smooth and fast. It's also nice to have a digital camera offering a 28mm wide-angle lens. Many cameras focus on the tele mode, forgetting there are some of us who want to capture grand vistas.

With the DC4800 you can select ISO values, use automatic and manual shutter speed and f-stop settings, and use 6X zoom (3X optical and 2X digital). This camera has a point-and-shoot design with optical manual controls. Image color modes such as saturated, neutral, black-and-white, or sepia are nice but I don't use them much. I prefer to capture the raw, high-res file and manipulate it on the desktop. 
  This is one of the few digital cameras offering simple light sensitivity controls, at 100, 200, and 400 ISO. 

Also, it's got a neat recharging function; you just plug the camera into the wall and it recharges. You don't have to remove the battery at all.

I have a couple of small beefs with the camera; the flash has to be manually raised, which can interfere with shooting. It really should pop up automatically. 
  Also, the on/off button is in an odd position: It sits in the middle of the exposure mode dial, right behind the shutter release. I caught myself pressing this button instead of the shutter occasionally. A mild inconvenience but irritating nonetheless.

The camera's included bundle is good, but not great:
  KODAK DC4800 Zoom Digital Camera with lens cap.
  Lithium-ion battery
  Neck strap
  KODAK Picture Card (16 Mb CompactFlash)
  AC Adapter
  USB cable
  Video output cable for TV viewing.
  DC4800 Zoom Camera User's Guide, and a Quick Start pamphlet.
  Warranty registration card
  Software CD-ROM 

A complete line of lenses and filters is available. The lens mount is 43mm.<br><br>
