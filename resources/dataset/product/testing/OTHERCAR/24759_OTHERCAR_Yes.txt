            In the winter of 1994, me and my Mercedes 300D, went shopping for another Mercedes.  We couldn't find the Mercedes dealer, and it started snowing, so I finally I gave up and went into the Cadillac showroom - UGH too big and I'm never going back to bench seats.  Across the street was a Lexus dealer and I said to myself: &quot;Self - no way, however I've another 30 minutes to burn, so let's see how the other half lives.&quot;  I was enroute to a ski slope in the Poconos, where I was to meet my daughter and this was in Wilmington, Delaware.   

The beginning of the affair was the courteous and polite reception in the Lexus show room.  I had recently received a snobbish reception from a Mercedes salesman down South, which was why I was looking for another Mercedes dealer.  Finally, even though it was snowing, a sales person convinced me that I should take a 300GS for a test ride. The Love affair starts.

After I'd returned home, the salesman called and convinced me to take a car for a few days.  I selected the LS 400 I'm now driving, a week later, I couldn't give it back.  My wife went from no-way, to gotta have it, in 2 days.

However, while I was &quot;testing&quot; it I continued to look at Mercedes's, but soon discovered that even if I went up 2 models in the Mercedes line, i.e., up to the really big Mercedes, we're talking $60 thousand plus here, the Lexus still had more room, especially in the back seats, and was much much quieter.  This quietness has impressed me the most, and invariably, this is the most common comment by passengers who have never experienced a Lexus before.  I think it even makes trips more pleasant and less tiring, since one is able to speak at normal levels.

Bought the car in February of 1994, and it is now just about to turn 70,000 miles. Replaced the tires, battery one time, and have had one brake job, other than that nothing.  For servicing the dealer meets me where ever, usually at work or home, with another Lexus, and brings the car back to me.  What a wonderful convenience!

Three years ago, convinced my neighbor to try one, and they bought a 300GS, equally pleased with the dealer and car.
