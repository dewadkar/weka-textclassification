            My digital camera needs were three: great-looking photos, download ease, tiny package. I did the research. Weighed my options. Picked a winner.

After three months of solid use, I've found the Canon Powershot S10 to be a real workhorse camera in a tiny, portable unit. And with the newer Canon S100 appearing in stores, you'll also find the S10 to be a sweet little bargain. 

The high-resolution allows me to mess up on the framing in my shots and crop it nicely in Photoshop later on when I have more time to think through the composition. A nice bonus I didn't expect to find was the way the camera handles low-light situations. I've got some dynamite night scenes and fireworks shots that I never could have hand-held with a standard SLR camera.

The camera also wins in the easy set-up and image downloading category. The software that comes with the camera is a rapid self-install for Mac or PC. The interface is utilitarian and organized and allows you to preview images before committing to download them. 

Finally, I love the size and look of the S10. It's durable (I've knocked it into things a few times and it hasn't failed me yet), and fits into larger pockets (think of those side-of-the-leg pockets on cargo pants). 

It also looks a lot like some of the cheaper point-and-shoot cameras, so it doesn't scream &quot;HEY STEAL ME! I'M EXPENSIVE!&quot; like some of the other digitals do.

It doesn't have all the features you may eventually look for if you really get into digital photography, and the batteries die FAST, so you'll need to buy a recharger kit right away, but for capturing your life's adventures, the Canon S10 is a sure thing.
