            This is my wifes car, she got it used with 49K miles in Feb. 1997. It has leather interior, cruise, power locks &amp; windows, the DOHC 3400 V6 and 4 wheel disc brakes. She bought the car to replace a 93 Grand Am that had no air conditioning.

I was very surprised at the overall handling of this car, I am used to small cars and this relatively large car corners pretty well. Acceleration is very good with the DOHC engine, gas mileage is OK. The automatic transmission shifts so smooth you never feel it changing gears. The styling is very attractive, the interior seems nice enough, and the car has a load of extras.

This is what you would notice at first, and probably why these cars sell, but after a while we have found some glaring faults. The turning radius is so large that parking is a challenge. There is more noise on the highway than I would expect from a car like this. The GM stereo/cassette has an incredible amount of bass from the rear, even with the bass adjusted to full negative its too much. If you like rap music get this car with the 6 speaker stereo, youll love it.  The front seats look very comfy but provide little support, and the leather is cold in winter and hot in summer, and there is no more leg room in the back seat than in my Escort GT. The cupholder is a neat idea, folding out of the console, but it will spill your drink on the first corner, and its the only cupholder in the entire vehicle. The dash layout is virtually the same as my moms 86 Buick Park Avenue, GM likes to save money by using common parts, they finally gave this car its own dash in 95. Im not really surprised by all this, GM was not a company known to take care of these kind of details.

We now have 72K on the car, the only problem experienced so far was a minor oil leak around 55k miles. Hopefully the car will last a long time, its a nice car overall despite the design flaws. If you are considering a used one, be aware that maintenance might cost more than you might expect. The DOHC engine has a timing belt, so it will need to be replaced. The tires are 16 inch and will cost extra, and the 4 wheel disc brakes might cost more to maintain. Changing the plugs requires loosening the engine mounts. Even replacing the battery will be a pain, a brace and the wiper fluid tank have to be taken off to get to it.
