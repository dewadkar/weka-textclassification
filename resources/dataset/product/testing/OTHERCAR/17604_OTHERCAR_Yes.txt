            When I bought my Plymouth Neon Expresso, I got it used.  They weren't any problems right off the bat.  I didn't even want to test drive it, because I didn't really like it.  But after I did, and realized that I couldn't afford the Stratus that was sitting next to it, I figured that this was the best one on the lot.  And I actually did fall in love with my car.  
Of course, about a week after I got it, I had problems.  The ERG Valve was clogged up, giving me 200 miles/tank of gas, instead of the usual 230 miles/tank of gas, and my fourth cylinder was misfiring.  But the car somehow corrected that before I could get it fixed, and then it happened again.  But this time, I'll get it fixed for sure.  Another problem was that the trunk was leaking in water like a SOB.  It was the seal around the left tail light.  So my trunk got all moldy and smelly.  And (now this only happens when it rains) the brakes squeal in the most Ungodly fashion.
Other than that, it is a Great First car!  But you always look at the other cars that you wished you got instead. *SIGH*  But it is quite roomy, and I'm 6 feet tall.  The trunk is really roomy, and has a pretty good factory sound system in it.  Of course I put in a Pioneer CD player, and two eight inch subs, and an AMP.
But it really is a great car!  I mean every car has its ups and downs..and don't just take my word for it...there are plenty of other reviews on this web site.  Check em out!
