            My '98 Grand Cherokee has 70,000 miles in 18 months with absolutely NO problems.  I follow the maintenance schedule religiously and the car has NEVER let me down.  I previously owned a '95 which I also put heavy duty mileage on and am totally pleased with the car.  I plan to drive it until the wheels fall off and buy another.  I have no reservations about recommending the vehicle to anyone.  It's probably one of the best values on the market.<br><br>
