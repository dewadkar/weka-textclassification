            The 93' Pontiac Grand Am we bought new from the dealer as a lease. Problem #1 we ended up paying twice as much for the car than the sticker price stated.  After bringing the car home we noticed it dents very easily.  A magnolia bloom falling from our tree put a huge dent in the hood.  We only had the car for about 3 months before the brakes went out and needed to be replaced.  We have now had the car for 6 years and have replaced the battery, brakes and tires 3x.  I do not like the vehicle due to the fact it just keeps requiring more and more maintenance that is due to normal wear and tear.  There is only 90k miles on this vehicle and has had the top of the line parts put on it.  The shocks have also had to be replaced.  Even with new shocks it feels like riding in a wagon, very bumpy.  It seems to be a very nice vehicle from appearance but make sure you check out everything under the hood and get a extensive warranty if you plan to purchase this vehicle, new or used.<br><br>
