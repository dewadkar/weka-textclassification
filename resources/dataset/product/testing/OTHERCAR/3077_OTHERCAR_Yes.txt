            I recently bought a Red 1996 Dodge Intrepid ES with 50,000 miles.  I really like the car, but I am having a few problems.  I had to get 2 new sway bar links (car made clunking noises when going over bumps, $240) and I had to get a new A/C evaporator (free under Dodge's 70,000 mile warranty).  But even though I got the A/C fixed, it doesn't get cold, and I found out that I have a hole in my condesor-so now that needs to be fixed.  I bought the car for $8,000 and have had to put $600 in it to get it all fixed, but now the car is ok.  The guy at the dealership that I bought it from took $2,000 off of the price- it was originally $10,000.  It has almost every option- Infinity Stereo with an Amp in the trunk (behind the trunk lining) and 9 speakers, Power everything, Power Antenna, Keyless Entry, 3.5 Liter V-6, Traction Control, and ABS.  It is very quick from the start, but the brakes don't work very well.  I really like the styling of the car, and the ground effects on the bottom of the doors.  The car is very roomy and comfortable.  One other thing that bothers me is that I practically have to slam the stereo buttons to make them work.  Even though it sounds like my car is a lemon, it's not.  It's a very nice car and I am happy I bought it.  I don't think $600 is too much to get everything fixed on my car.  I would recommend this car to others-  but get a'96 or newer...any older and you will probably have problems.
