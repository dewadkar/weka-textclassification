            You are looking for a good quality camera, but want the most for your money.  You don't want the cheapest, but can't afford the best?  I can tell you that you will be very pleased with the Nikon Coolpix 800.  It will cost you about 450-500, and runs on AA batteries.  Stay away from the Lithium batteries...very expensive and don't last as long if you have and LCD viewfinder.  The coolpix also has an 8 ft. flash range and 8 second shot delay.  It also has 8MB storage and is plenty for just a regular family household camera.  I would also recommend the Hewlett Packard Photosmart C500 for about $50 more if you absolutely have to have more memory, a bit more zoom, and a battery charger.  Both are great deals that you will be pleased with.<br><br>
