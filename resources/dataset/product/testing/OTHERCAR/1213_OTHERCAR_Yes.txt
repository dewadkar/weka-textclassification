            I drive various company-owned SUV's, and I find the '03 Suburban the best that I have driven to date. It is the best combination of power, comfort, suspension stiffness and versatility on the road.

Acceleration is crisp and precise, even with a full load, but the accelerator is set up to ease into the load, so your initial touch does not send your head bouncing backwards. You can easily be be at full speed by the end of any entrance ramp and ready to merge with traffic.

The steering has the amount of oversteer that I prefer, so a small turn of the wheel means a big turn of the front wheels. (I drive a half-ton GMC pickup, and they behave the same way.) A driver accustomed to cars may need some time to adjust. Because of this oversteer, road feel is very good.

Combined with a stiff 4x4 suspension, the ride can seem harsh to some drivers, especially on uneven or rough pavement. The wrong road will turn you and your passengers into BobbleHead dolls. But this suspension is most often a benefit to steady, secure handling in turns. There is very little listing to the outside of a turn which is common in many other SUV's.

Interior design is practical without being overdone. The ergonomics are great for a tall driver (I'm 6'3"), but the driver's seat is adjustable enough to accommodate those who are built normally. Visibility is great with the exception of the split rear door, which can limit your view directly to the rear.

I've been averaging around 15MPG, which is horrid in the big picture, but better than the 12MPG the Ford Excursion I used to drive got. 

If the full-size SUV is in your future, the '03 Suburban should be at the top of your list.
