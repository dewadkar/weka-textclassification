            I leased my 2000 Montero Sport in October of 1999. I had just come off a Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado that I thought was great.  Both have good looks,both have great rides, and both suited a multitude of needs.  The Montero is actually bigger, has larger tires and sits higher off the ground.  The interior is plush with an excellent standard AM/FM-CD radio.  The utility electric socket is well placed in the armrest for a cell phone.  The gas milage is good on the highway, but boggs down in bumper to bumper traffic, especially with the AC on.  This SUV was recently taken on a 2400 mile trip and ran excellent with one minor problem.  Steep highway grades gave this standard engine some problems.  On very steep grades in upstate New York, it had a trendency to downshift out of overdrive.  Again with the AC on the problem was compounded.  The pearl dark green and silver beige two tone paint is great with one minor complaint. Passengers have a tendency to scrape their feet against the side panels getting in the car, leaving either scuffs or worse yet scratches in the paint.  This paint finish is so hard, the bumper scratched went hit with a shopping cart.  I would place this SUV on the list of vehicles to test drive and buy.  

The pricing at aproximately $27,000 is just right for a fully equiped, four wheel drive SUV.  Since the Sport uses the larger Montero's body, save yourself a couple of bucks and go with the Sport.  Besides it has better looking than the new 2001 Monteros. <br><br>
