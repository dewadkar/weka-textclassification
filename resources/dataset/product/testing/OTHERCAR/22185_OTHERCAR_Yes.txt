            I had originally decided on the Kodak DC280.  I did alot of research, including reading all opinions on Epinions.com.  I researched prices and found the lowest price at Centore.com.  I placed my order and waited.  Approx. 1 week later, a representative from Centore called and informed me that the DC280 was being replaced with the DC3400.  He advised me that I could upgrade to the DC3400 with a rapid battery charger and four NiMH rechargeable batteries for approx. $20 more than the original price.  The total price was approx. $387.00.  I agreed and about 5 days later I had my camera.

This is my first digicam, and I couldn't be more thrilled.  This camera is just fantastic.  Within minutes of opening the box, I was taking pictures with it.  The image quality is fantastic, with rich colors and outstanding detail.  The camera has exceeded my expectations in every detail so far.  

I've read alot of complaints about battery life with Digicams.  So far, I've shot approx. 60-70 pictures with differing qualities and resolutions on the original alkaline batteries that come with the camera.  I've also played with different menu options and settings and the low battery indicator has yet to make an appearence.  I've mainly used the optical viewfinder, but even doing that the image appears briefly on the lcd screen after it's captured.  I also purchased a SanDisk compact flash card reader (approx. $24.00 at OfficeMax), so that too, may explain the battery life.  You can connect the camera directly to your computer with the supplied USB or serial cables, but I prefer the speed and drag-and-drop convience of the card reader.

I feel like finding "cons" with this camera is very tough and nit-picky, but with that in mind, here are the only "cons" that I would mention.  The camera ships with only an 8 MB compact flash card.  You will probably want to purchase a higher capacity card.  I found a Simple Technologies 64 MB card at Egghead.com for $79.99, which is a very reasonable price, comparatively speaking.  The placement of the LCD screen virtually guarantees that it will get smudges if you use your right eye to frame the picture with the optical view finder.  The LCD screen is virtually impossible to see in direct sunlight. Other than these minor issues, I've yet to find anything not to like about this camera.

I would whole-heartedly recommend this camera to anyone in the market for a 2MP, easy to use, point and shoot digital camera.
