            From the moment I saw the PT Cruiser advertised, I LOVED its design. The design definitely lives up to its marketing- the joy of looking at it doesn't wear off. I realized from the outset, that, at my age (22), this car was NOT marketed to me. It was definitly within my budget though. And while I might have been expected to fall for the similarly priced and equally over-advertised VW Bug, I appreciate the added room and size of the Cruiser. The features I got are great- the &quot;moonroof&quot;, CD player and adjustable &quot;trunk&quot; configurations all live up to promise. I chose to get a silver Cruiser, as I was a bit scared of the garishness of the other colors. BUT I only viewed these on the website at first, and the non-traditional colors do look GREAT in person. Everyone has commented on how much more room than expected the backseat has for passengers. Its not a minivan, but its not a tiny bug or small-sized sedan either. There are tons of safety options, which I suppose are more geared towards parents, but I appreciate them all the same. Side air bags for only a few hundred dollars extra is hard to pass up. I do wish I would have gotten a larger engine, because the base engine- even with the manual transmission I have- does require literally flooring it to get onto the interstate. But this is a very small complaint compared to the positive aspects of the vehicle. A note of warning: when you get this car, you begin to believe that everyone else on the road is either flirting with you, staring at how bad your hair looks, or sending you glances about the quality of your driving. Really, they are just checking out your car. This is distracting but it does help the ego!<br><br>
