            I bought this camera at a wholesale club for about $224, which was a pretty good price, I guess.  I wanted to be able to take pictures without the developing costs of a regular camera, and something where I could put pictures on the computer.  It came with a nice fanny-pack type case where you could carry the camera, extra batteries, etc. with you.

This camera is easy to use and works well IF you have perfect lighting.  The downfall of the camera is just that.  It does not work well indoors, because there is not enough light.  If you have a really bright light that you can use to light up the room, it works ok.  Otherwise, the pictures are so dark, you can barely tell what it is.  This model does not come with a flash, which I think is a big mistake.  

Likewise, if you are using the camera outdoors, and have too much sun, you cannot see the picture on the screen, and the pictures come out with a big glare in them, and so light that you can't see them well.  

I took this camera on vacation recently, and was unable to use it really at all.  The light was either too little or too much to get a good picture, so we ended up using one of those cheap disposable cameras instead.  

I think if it had a flash and a stronger adjustment for outdoor bright lighting, that this camera would be great.  Short of that, it just isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Could be a lot better!  If I ever buy another one, I will be sure to get one with a flash.
