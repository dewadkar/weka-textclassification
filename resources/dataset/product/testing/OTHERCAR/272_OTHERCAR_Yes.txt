            I have had my D-510 for about three months now, and I could not be happier.  It is easy to use and takes great pictures.  At under $350, it's a great deal, too.

As with almost everything I buy, I researched digital cameras to death.  I decided I wanted to spend under $400, which meant that 3 megapixel cameras were pretty much out of the picture (no pun intended).  I don't plan on printing any 11x14's anyway, so 2 megapixels is plenty.  I wanted optical zoom, which narrowed my choices considerably.  Given my limited choices, I went with Olympus based on price and my past positive experiences with Olympus film cameras.  I am not disappointed.  The camera with an additional 64MB memory card cost under $400, with shipping.  

The camera is point and click.  No training required.  Two quick pushes of the monitor button gets you a photo preview.  It allows pre-focusing, has several flash modes, etc.  In other words, pretty much everything a reasonably sophisticated person would want.  

Picture quality is fantastic.  Color is accurate and true.  My prints definitely rival those of film, at least in the sizes that I have printed (up to 5x7).  

I bought a 64MB memory card, which holds about 120 pictures.  The included 8mb card holds less than a roll of film at high resolution.  

Uploading to my computer is a snap.  Plug in the USB cable, and the camera shows up as a drive.  Copy to your hard disk and you are done.  Truly painless.  The camera also includes a video cable so that you can view your shots on TV.  This is a big hit with the kids.  Instant slide show!

The camera will also take short movies, but I have not tried this.  I have a MiniDV camera, so I am not likely to use this very much.  Plus, have to learn how, which will require using the CD-ROM based documentation.  A hard copy book would have been appreciated.  

In short, the D-510 takes great pictures, has great features, and can be had at a great price.
