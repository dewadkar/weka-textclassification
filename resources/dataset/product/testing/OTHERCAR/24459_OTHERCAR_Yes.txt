            WHY I PURCHASED - I made my way around the local electronics stores looking for the best digital camera for the money and found myself talking to a very knowledgeable gentleman at my favorite store. He showed me how the 1.3MP (good 5x7), 2.1MP (good 8x10), and 3.34MP (good 8x10 even after cropping and enlarging) cameras stacked up and what the results I should expect to see out of each. I figured he must have been a fan of Sony (like myself) because he immediately took me to the CyberShot cameras and told me about how much easier the Sony�s are to operate than their competition. I spent two hours in that store picking his brain and by then a group had formed around me and three other couples ended up taking the S50 home with them and 1 guy took home an S30 at the same time.

THINGS I LOVE - I love the size of the camera along with the size of the 64MB Memory Stick that I purchased along with it. It is a nice small convenient package. I also love the options you have for reading the pictures into the computer (ie: Optical Mouse w/Memory Stick Reader). Most important of all is the Flip-Around Display that gives you a few different ways to position the LCD (Very Nice).

THINGS I HATE - I can�t really say that I hate the absence of an optical viewfinder because of the battery life anyway and the �What You See is What You Get� LCD is awesome, but it would be nice to have an optical viewfinder just in case.
