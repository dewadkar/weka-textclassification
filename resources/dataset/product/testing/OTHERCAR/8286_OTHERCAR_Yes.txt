            When my 1993 Protegï¿½ was getting too expensive to repair, I decided to go all out and get a new car.  After seeing the new 2003 Corolla at an auto show and reading reviews on epinions, I knew what I wanted.

My dealership experience was wonderful.  I emailed four Toyota dealerships via their online contact form and of the four, only Erin Park Lexus Toyota (in Canada) had contacted me.  It was a little thing, but enough for me to know that the service there would be good.  (Plus, I called the other dealerships and over the phone I wasn't impressed and one dealership left me on hold for 10 minutes without so much as a "thank you for continuing to hold").  So off to Erin Park I went.  My salesman was excellent and clearly explained the benefits, improvement of the new Toyota over previous models and he even took me out to SHOW me the older Corollas so I could see these improvements for myself.  Nice touch.

I first test drove the Corolla, I drove the Corolla S (B package).  I didn't like it.  I don't like spoilers and the moon roof wasn't my cup of tea.  It drove well, although I didn't get to really see the power because I wasn't going to floor it with the salesman in the car.  But for a 'normal' drive on local streets and the highway, it was fine.  But again, the options weren't my thing.  So we took an the CE (B package) out and I loved it.  The only thing that I wish I could have had was power windows (which are now available in the 2004 models).  

I decided to finance a Black Sand Pearl 2003 Toyota Corolla CE, Automatic, B package (keyless entry, power locks, a/c).  I got a graduate discount off my car (I'm a recent grad).  My parents decide to chip in and get me the Extra Care Protection.  After everything was figured out, I'm paying $375CAD per month. 

The car is very comfortable.  The seats are apparently designed by a chiropractor (?) and are extremely comfortable.  The gear was odd for me at first (after driving my protege for 6 years), but it didn't take long to get used to.  The radio was nice.  I didn't require any fancy stereo and the one in the CE was more than adequate for me.  1 CD, 2 FM options, 1 AM.  It's not programmable and sometimes I wonder just how "random" the random option for the CD is.  There is lots of room for "stuff" in the car.  I tend to live out of my car and I have MORE than enough room to store things.  The trunk is extremely spacious.  The rear seats fold down allowing for more trunk room.  The back seats are equipped with three "stations" to attach booster seats.  If you are using one, it is VERY easy to just pop the seat in, tether it, and go.  The car drives very smoothly.  I don't know very much about the workings of engines, but from where I stand, it goes fast (130-140 km/hr) enough for me without me having to force the car.  It handles very well and I can't feel when the transmission changes gears.  The car gets a LOT of mileage for a tank of gas.  I've driven as much as 550 km before having to fill the car up again.  I use regular gas (per the manual) and the car is fine.  I used premium gas in the car once and it didn't seem to make a difference from what I could notice.

Now.  The car hasn't been flawless.  Three days after I bought the car, the pillar molding on the driver's side fell out and hit me while I was driving.  NOT A HAPPY TIME.  I took it to the closest dealership and the guy "appeared" to have fixed it.  But a few days later, it fell out again.  I took it back to the dealership where I first got it repaired and ended up having to leave it there for the weekend to get it fixed properly.  Which wasn't a big deal because I was given a rental.  But the experience was very depressing.  A new car should NOT be falling apart after 2 or 3 days.  The Customer Service agent at Toyota didn't seem to concerned with my problem and told me "that's what the warranty is there for."  Note: don't deal with 1-888-Toyota.  HORRIBLE customer service.  I also noticed that the wind noise inside the car was a bit ridiculous.  I just figured that it was a flaw with the car and ignored it.  It turned out that the rubber weather strips in the back doors weren't installed properly and was causing the noise.  Again, unhappy with how poorly the car appears to have been assembled.  I'm also a bit dismayed by the fact that there isn't much I can DO to upgrade the car (adding fog lights, etc).  It's just not really feasible to add some options after the fact.
