            For about the past year I have been previewing several automobiles because my youngest daughter got her license. I had an extra vehicle, so I was fortunate not to be in a hurray.  After much deliberation and two months without a car payment, I decided on the Altima.  I already own a Nissan Sentra and have been very satisfied with the quality.  What I really wanted was something more comfortable to ride with good gas mileage.  

In addition to a good track record, I found that Nissan's were more economical than their competitors in the same class.  I had test driven a few Toyota Camrys which I found very tempting, but I was not able to negotiate as fair a price as I did with Nissan.

By watching newspaper ads, I was able to purchase the car for over $2500 under the sticker price.  There were no hassles since I was not forced to buy and there was a manufacturer rebate of $1000 and a Nissan car loan at 5.9% interest rate with a good credit history.

The excellent gas mileage and smooth ride are great assets.  I especially like the CD player/alarm combo.  I recommend this car to anyone who is looking for affordable and  reliable transportation.  I base this on my past experience with my Sentra and a friend who owns a 1995 Altima and loves it too.

Go for it!<br><br>
