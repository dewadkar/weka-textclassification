            For a camera that's easy to use and produces excelent pictures, you can't go wrong with the C-2000z. I was in the market for a 2+ megapixel camera, and quite honestly, the C-2000z was the only thing that came closest to my needs. I wanted CompactFlash TypeII, SLR, and USB as well, but there wasn't a camera on the market that had ALL of these features that was under $1000 (if at all). So, I decided I could live with an external USB card reader (MUCH faster than the camera's built-in serial connection), and that SmartMedia was really cheaper in the end. SLR is nice, but with the built-in LCD, you get nearly the same results.

The image quality is nothing to complain about. You do get some red/blue noise, but there's a Photoshop filter that can clean that up. I've gotten exceptional outdoor and low-light results from the camera, better than I expected. With some minor adjustments, just about any photo can come out outstanding. It is unfortunate, however, that many of the adjustments are menu driven, which takes time to use. I also long for more zoom at times, however, 3x seems to be the norm in todays Consumer market digicams.

Battery life is poor with alkaline batteries, but I invested $35 in a good charger and set of NiMH batteries, and I've gotten a surprising amount of pictures with them (with and without flash, with and without LCD - both are battery eaters), only hitting low battery once during a shooting session.

I love the concept of the digital camera - instant pictures without the waste and wondering of film. If I don't like a picture, I can delete and retake it (where possible). And since I primarily want my pictures in the PC, the digicam saves me two steps - film processing and scanning. That, and it's a perfect excuse to take oodles and oodles of pictures of my little girl being as cute as she is. The Olympus - especially with a tripod and the remote - is perfect for this. The remote enables those cute family portraits without having to bug someone else to take the picture.

All in all, a good buy for me... I paid $739, but PriceScan shows as of this date $695, and it's falling every week. Expensive, but worth the convenience for me. Be careful though, accessories can push the price even higher (additional SmartMedia - it only comes with a meager 8MB, tripod, lens adapter, case, batteries, A/C adapter, USB Reader for quick transfers).<br><br>
