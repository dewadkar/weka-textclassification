            This BMW is the best on the lot. Towers over the Mercedes-Benz C-Class anyday. Has better steering, and better control. Plus a much smoother ride. The 3-series has a coupe, a sedan and a convertible. Ajustible head rests are standard and great front airbags are stantard as well. Dual airbags as well.The 318 has a 1.8 liter engine. The 323 has a 2.5 liter engine but is less fuel efficient. The seats are extremely comfortable, yet i think the back was meant for kids only. Once again, all the cars in the 3-series have great control. If you are looking for a new car, or if you just have some free time...go test the BMW 3-Series.<br><br>
