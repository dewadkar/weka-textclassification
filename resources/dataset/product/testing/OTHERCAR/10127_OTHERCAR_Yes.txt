            I owned a 1994 Protege.  I bought it slightly used in 1995.  I bought it for the price, around $12,000.  I traded this car off in 1998 with 140,000 miles on it.  I commuted about 110 miles per day round trip.  I traded because I was scared to keep driving a car with that many miles on it.  Now, I wish I'd kept that car.  We never had to do one thing to it.  We just kept up the maintenance.  It was a 5-speed and it was so fun to drive.  It was the first 5-speed I had owned as my personal car and I thought, why hadn't I bought a 5-speed before because this is great.  The car got unbelievable gas mileage - 40 miles per gallon on the highway, and about 32 in town.  With gas prices today I am so regretting trading it off.<br><br>
