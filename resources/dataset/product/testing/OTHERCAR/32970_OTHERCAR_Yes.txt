            When I bought a new Camry I really had no doubts.  This was in 1997 and they had recently changed the body style to the sleek, somewhat sporty family car.  I bought cashmere beige with the gold package, and wood package.  This car is so comfortable, we drove it nine hours straight on vacation and the seats were wonderful.  Not to mention a few other trips we took. 
 The 1991 I owned before, I bought used and just really loved it.  It too was comfortable and at the time I had heard the camry's were so reliable and comfortable I just had to try it.  So when the opportunity came a few years later, I had to buy another camry.  We became the two camry family.  
This car had so much power for a four cylinder 2.2 liter I was amazed.  It accelerated smoothly and I had no fears of any problems.  Besides all the other beautiful features Toyota offered on this camry were the moon roof and very nice stereo.  Toyota offers so may luxuries, this car is a must have.  Yes it might be a little more expensive than it competitors but my opinion, very worth it.  This car will last for miles and miles.  I have no complaints.  Plenty of leg room, plenty of head room, everything you could want in an automobile.  My advise, buy this and you wont be let down.  I recommend it to anyone.
If you are thinking of a car to buy your teenager for the first car, buy a used Camry.  These cars have won so many safety awards you wont have to worry about your teenager being in an unsafe sports car.  Like I said before, I recommend it to anyone.
