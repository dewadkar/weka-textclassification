            I bought my 1998 Sunfire when it first came out thinking I was the coolest guy on the block with my brand new car.  It turns out that this car has kept me from getting a lot of dates during the past three years.  Since it was so cheap, alot of people bought these, most being female.  Therefore, everytime I go anywhere, guys stare into my window thinking to see a cute blonde, instead they see a 6'2 guy.  Other than that aspect, this is actually a very good car.  It is very easy to handle, starts up no problem, interior is nice, and the stereo system is pretty good.  Above all, I can pay 17.00 for a full tank and go about 450 miles without refueling.  I have been saved many times by the the steering on this car.  It is pretty tight, but at the same time isn't hard to turn.  All in all, if you want style in an automobile, get a Mustang; If you want a good traveling car, the Sunfire is your man.<br><br>
