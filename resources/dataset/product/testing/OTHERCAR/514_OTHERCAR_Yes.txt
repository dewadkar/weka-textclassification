            You'd think that digital cameras were a serious "hobby" for me as I've written a few reviews about others I've owned or used in the past.  You're right.  Years ago I was into photography, but the cost of film and processing caused me to put it on the back burner.  Digital photography freed me of those ongoing costs, and in the last couple of years, I can't seem to take enough pictures!  The Olympus C-2100 has only made this hobby more of an addiction.

<b>INTRO</b>

In today's digital camera market, it's like going to a car lot and talking about horse power in a car's engine.  The buzz word here, is "megapixel".  Digital images are measured in size depending on the number of pixels that make up the image.  Today, a 3 - megapixel image is "hot".  Last year, it was 2 megapixels, and back from there.  A state of the art 1 megapixel camera from two years ago cost up to $1000, and can now be bought for $150 or so, so you can see how quickly prices are dropping.  

The C-2100 is a 2.1 megapixel camera.  This basically means that the largest sized photo it produces is 1600 pixels by 1200 pixels (about twice the size of the viewing area of many computer monitors).  When printing, it will produce a great 5 x 7 photo, and really good 8 x 10, provided you have a good printer and paper.  But let's not get too far ahead.

<b>THE CAMERA FEATURES AND MORE</b>

The C-2100 is a slightly larger than normal camera, in that it is not "palm sized" like some newer cameras.  The extra size is due to it's zoom lens.  As a matter of fact, this camera's main feature is the 10x power optical zoom lens, that also features "image stabilization", a feature that steadies the image even if your hand is shaking, helping to reduce the chance of a blurred photo. Forget cheap cameras that offer a fake "digital zoom", or the majority of other cameras that only have a 2x or 3x optical zoom.  This camera's zoom will bring you as close as a 380mm zoom lens would on a traditional 35mm film camera (for you film users), or let's say, a higher power set of binoculars.

The 2.1 megapixel image size is just fine for the sized photos I mentioned earlier.  Sales people will tell you this is "obsolete", but that is not the case.  The C-2100 has such excellent quality lens glass and optics, that it will produce great images both on screen, and in print.  If you need to print images larger than 8 x 10 inches, then yes, perhaps a 3+ megapixel camera is in order.  But for the sizes of prints most of us get, this is more than enough.

Some Epinions errors to correct:  If you read the specs they list for this camera on their description, it lists "no flash".  This is not true.  The C-2100 has a pop up flash that hides when not in use, above the lens barrel.  When you need it, press a button, and it pops open, offering a good amount of flash when needed.  They also list this as a "point and shoot" camera, and that is partically correct; if you're a novice, you can leave the camera set to "auto" and let it do most of the work, however, if you're into photography, you have control (if you want) manually of focus, shutter speed, exposure, and more.  It's not just a point and shoot.  There is a LOT of creative control.

The camera features a LCD as well as an electronic viewfinder.  Think of it as a small tv in the eyepiece that shows you many of the camera's settings when you look through it.  Four rechargeable NiMh batteries and a charger come with it, and please, buy one more set.  You WILL need NiMh rechargeables with this camera.  Regular off-the-shelf AA batteries last no more than 15 photos - literally.  The rechargeables will last for a full day with normal use, and you can use them over and over again.  Epinions also list the "storage capacity" at 16 megs... do not confuse this as how many photos you can take.  The camera comes with an 8 meg Smart Media memory card, but you can buy larger cards up to 64 megs that will work with this camera, allowing you to take many photos.  The 16 meg reference is an internal "buffer" that temporarily saves photos when you're taking "burst" photos - that is, many photos in a short number of seconds.

There is a movie mode that allows you to take short video clips with sound (movies are great, sound is only so-so), so you can add some movies to your collection.

The controls are well placed on the back and top of the camera.  A threaded lens barrel allows you to add 49mm lens filters to protect the lens, or use for special effects.  The camera will allow you to take photos in color, black and white, sepia (rusty colored), and more.  While this is not exactly a super simple camera to operate out of the box, if you take the time to read the manual, you can master all of the basic functions in a short amount of time.   

<b>THE BAD</b>

The camera as just mentioned, is not the easiest to figure out at first.  You DO need to read the manual.  The on-screen menu allows you to adjust everything from the photo's pixel size to it's quality and much more, but can overwhelm first time digital camera users.  If you are a very very impatient person that gives up easy, this may not be a camera for you.  The built in microphone will allow you to have sound to the short video clips, however, sinc eit's built-in, it picks up the noise from the zoom and camera engine, so, I would have a gripe with the microphone, but you can of course use an external one and that solves that.  Other than that, I literally cannot find anything else wrong.

<b>THE PRICE</b>

Many stores as of July 2001 are telling people this is a "discontinued" camera.  It is not.  The stores themselves are discontinuing carrying it on their shelves in favor of newer models, but the C-2100 is still available online or by special order.  While some are still trying to squeeze out $799 for this camera, shop around, there are better deals to be had.

Don't let sales people try to talk you into the Olympus C-700 as the "replacement", either.  It's a little cheaper and also has a 10x zoom, but it has poorer image quality, NO image stabilization, and no threaded lens barrel for filters.

<b>SAMPLE PHOTOS</b>

By going to http://photos.yahoo.com/greg30127  you'll see an album titled C-2100 Ultra Zoom.  Click it to bring up some samples I've taken with this camera (click on the small thumbnail images to see larger versions).  While Yahoo somewhat distorts the images (the originals are better), you'll see how good even these are.

The C-2100 is a very good investment for photo buffs.  It should offer everything you need, and I think you'll be happy with the results.
