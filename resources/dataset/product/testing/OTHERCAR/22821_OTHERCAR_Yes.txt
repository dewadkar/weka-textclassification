            This truck is excellent!  It is my very first truck and I love it so far.  Though the ride (above 50 mph), it kind of vibrates a little more than my old '93 Mercury Tracer I traded in for it.

Other than that, the sound inside is good.  I do not like the handwound windows, nor the bench seat, but it makes out okay.  I am 5'7 so it is perfect for us 'little people', it fits like a GLOVE!  and I can actually SEE the road.  But 'power' windows, locks and mirrors would be much appreciated if they were added or options.

It's a really great truck.  Good enough to ride in, but also good enough to ship and haul things also.  want to go biking or canoeing with me?  Email me.

The dark green looks better in person than it does on the website.

The extra cab version looks like it has more space, which is does, which allows you to adjust the cab seat back a few more inches for taller drivers/passengers.

Also, opt for the bucket seats if possible, the bench is nice, but the buckets are better, trust me.

I do not know if my indoor light is malfunctioning. It will not shut off when I close the door, so I have to manually do it.
