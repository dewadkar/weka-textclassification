                 It's hard to fault this car so far. I've owned mine for about 6 months now and I have 13,000 miles on the clock. 
     UPDATE! Currently the car has been mine for 18 months and I've put 35.5 thousand miles on it. It continues to run well and act basically like it did the day I drove it off the lot when new. 
     The car is good looking for the price, head and shoulders above it's predecessor, Sephia, in my "epinion"! 
     I live in Vermont. I bought it in the cold of January and the doors didn't seem to want to seat on their switches to shut off the dash "door ajar" light. So on certain curves, centrifugal force cause the doors to separate from their switch and voila, instant interior lighting just when you don't want it! The dealership so far has not really been able to duplicate the problem as it is warm and the body and doors aren't so stiff. 
     The overhead light comes on when you are driving as the body/doors (must flex and) cause ceiling interior light to activate. So, I just turned the o/head light permanently off. Pain in the neck, as no light comes on automatically when I open the doors to get in when it's dark. If you leave the overhead light in the "on" position, it may well come on while you are out of the car, thereby draining the battery. Hope this makes some sense to someone...
     Other than that, I am really enjoying the car. It is my first new car and I bought it for commuting. For this purpose it is doing well, it looks a bit sportier than your average commuter but I think they could hike up the mileage abilities abit somehow. 36 mpg is my best on a 500 mile run to Delaware, hopefully because I'm now using Amalie synthetic motor oil. It does indicate a tad cooler on the temp guage too.     
Again, the seats are real comfy. Good for smaller individuals (I'm 5'6"/165 lbs).      
The transmission is a tad "notchy"(meaning:it's not easy to shift quickly). You really have to stick to the "H" pattern and don't try to round off the corners.
     One last gripe. The rear deck is too high, restricting visibility. I have managed to back into two immovable objects, puncturing my rear bumper and denting the rear quarter panel.  Watch out for this if you get one! It is hard to gauge how far you actually are from objects.        Visibility is hampered when you actually turn in the seat to look behind.  Using the mirrors is better. I think most hatchbacks might share this visibility problem? Many of these cars that have been around a while have a dent or scratch near the rear (backing incidents)!
Could benefit from a rear wiper too, on every model. The GSX model,which also has power stuff inside, also has the wiper. UPDATE: I think the '03 model GS/GSX hatchbacks are coming with rear wipers now.
     As far as the engine, I drive 80mph out in the open nicely at about 3800 rpm, or half it's range, roughly. Torque/acceleration is wimpy. A long open stretch is advisable for passing. The car goes well but I feel the need to "hang on" firmly. I wonder a little about the tire compound/suspension set-up. Also, seems like they could do something about the gas mileage with a car and engine of this size. But maybe I shouldn't complain about 36Hwy,30 around town.
But hey...It's a small, inexpensive vehicle that's zesty looking, is quite comfortable inside with a nice sounding stereo and darn bright projector hi-beam headlights that really reach out and touch someone!
     So far, I'm STILL recommending it. Thanks for reading, hope it helps! Tom
Update! Finally traded the Spectra(on an '04 Kia Optima) with 44k on it, 6 days shy of two years ownership. Still running strong, good mileage, comfort, etc. The stock tires needed replacement after about 43k and I was detecting a buzz in the gearshift on the road at RPM's. My take: She's ready for plugs.  I'm writing about my Ruby Red 2004 Optima in the New Car Section...but I'll say this much here: It's a really nice car! See you there? Tom
