            The Chevy Venture for 2000 has many new features which make it a wonderful van for families. It has versatility and convenience as well as a sleek appearance.
Some of the features I have were optional. Everyone has choices as to what they need for their van.

I'll start with the least important element. My van is red.

Now getting down to the basics. I like it because we travel in the summer. We go to the beach with a van load of people so we like the multiple seats provided. We take trips with our two dogs so I like the ability to fold the seats and have plenty of back room for traveling cages. During the year we are always hauling something either home, or to someone else's home, so I enjoy the ability to switch from passenger to cargo van. The adaptable interior is the best in my book.

The prices range from $19,000 to $20,000. The variables are the additional features. There is room for some price adjustments especially with a trade-in. We've learned never to accept the sticker price. You can do research on the web and find the best price.

Air bags are required these days but this van goes further. Venture has the combination of driver and front passenger air bags(1), side-impact air bags(1) and 4-wheel ABS standard on every model. 

Now this is a pricey van, but we were able to work a deal with our company and get the fleet price. This varies from company to company and also according to the features, but I can tell  you it is under $20,000.

So what are some of the features of this van? Well, as you'd expect at this price you better get plenty of high end features, and the van does not disappoint.

It has air conditioning, a cargo liftgate, child safety slilding door, cruise control, cup holders for all three passenger rows, a reare window defogger, OnStar service is available.
 It can seat up to eight people. One of the features I love is the tilt wheel. I'm short so I have to move up close to reach the pedals. The tilt wheel is essential for me to be comfortable.

My husband and I like to listen to quiet music on FM, my son has his own taste in music. The van offers more than my husband and I need, but my son loves these features.
 Am/FM stero and CD player. Our son can bring his own CDs and enjoy his music when he drives the van. Standard is the digital clock.
  
Another neat feature is that there are two sliding doors. This is so convenient when you have a load of passengers at the beach and everyone wants to get out fast. Actually, it's convenient at any time.

The glass is tinted which helps keep the van from overheating the interior in the summer. It works good now also with the glare of winter light on snow in New England.

The outside mirrors both operate with remote control.

There is a luggage carrier.   The tires are all-season. I don't know if that's good or bad with snow and ice. We have antilock brakes for both front and rear. The keyless entry is a real bonus because I can start the van from my deck, let it warm up and then hop in.

Gas mileage isn't too great. Maybe ten miles to the gallon on the highway. You pay in gas for the convenience of a large van for your family.

So even though the van costs what it used to cost for a small house, it is worth it. We have a guarantee on all parts and labor for five years so we are assured of not needing to spend money on upkeep repairs. Our last van lost it's transmission the day before the warranty ran out, but the dealer replaced it with no problem at all. So we trust our Chevy dealer to live up to the guarantees.

And to make this article even more helpful I want to add that if you like the Chevy Venture you can save a lot of money by buying a used model. If you buy from a reliable dealer the van will be checked over and any problems corrected. You'll even be able to get a warranty.

If you don't have a large family, lots of friends, or a need for such a big vehicle, check out the Focus. I hear they are great little compact cars.
