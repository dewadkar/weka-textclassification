            I bought a used 1998 Mercury Mountainer this winter. I love it. It handles the road great. Comes with a ton of features (cd player,power everything, all wheel drive, controlled seats, thermomoter you name it it's got it)
I used to fear snow storms but after having 2 major ones this winter, I made it to work no problem. This SUV handles snow covered roads wonderfully. I will never go back to driving a car. I feel very safe in my SUV.
Driving this vehicle is wonderfull you feel like you own the road. Other people dont cut you off as often since the vehicle is so big and they dont want to get hit by it. The vehicle also has awesome power with a V-8 engine. Same engine as the 1996 Ford Mustand GT. It is one powerfull vehicle.<br><br>
