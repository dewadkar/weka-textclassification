                  My very first experience with jeep was a 1988 Cherokee. It was a speedy V-6, automatic w/ shift on the fly four wheel drive. I bought it for for $3600 (used) and I drove that bad boy into the ground. I'm one of those people that believes that a 4x4 should be driven like a 4x4. My friend and I took that jeep into some places that most 4x4's would even dare. One day we were feeling particularly devious and decided to try and tackle a rocky hill. I popped a tire but we made it all the way to the top and managed to get back to a gas station to boot. 
      Jeep's are not just sport utilities. They have an attitude that says &quot;leave me alone or I'll run you over&quot; I really loved being able to drive through snow, over ice, across small streams, and just down a nice paved street. My jeep handled like a dream. It corned well and had enough juice to beat my cousins 95 Chevy Sonoma (V-6) in un-official races. My gas mileage was pretty good too; around 17 mpg in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. 
      To find draw backs to my jeep I had to think long and hard. The biggest problem I could come up with was the bumpy ride. I really didn't mind it, but my pals were always complaining about bouncing around (especially in the back seat because your right over the axle) I'm 6'4'' and at times I could have used just a little more room, but overall I thought it was roomy. You don't want to try and squeeze more than 3-4 people in any model of jeep because they just aren't that big. 
      If your are looking for a go everywhere vehicle that is powerful enough to take you to the edge of the world, but down to earth enough to go grocery shopping then you need to consider a Jeep Cherokee. They are a ton of fun, practical, and a good buy for the long run.
       As a note I will be writing a more formal version of this epinion when I get some time, so make sure to come back!!<br><br>
