            I have always liked to drive a Saab and believe me I have tried numerous of cars but  always returned back to this Scandinavian brand.
I have to say I haven't had the chance to try it when it's summer but my main goal was indeed to get a good winter car ( I live in Finland, so it's really important that the car is drivebul on snow and ice), and that's what I got when I bought my Saab 9-3.
It could eat a bit less of gasoline ( at winter-time it's 16,1 liters/100 km = 6,7 gallons per. 100 miles. and at summer-time the car eats 11,5 liters/100 km. = 4,8 gallons per 100 miles.)
Relative growth between summer and winter expenditure in gasoline is more than 40 %.
But it also has good qulitys like side.mirror warmers, fabulous lights and a good seat heaters.
Saab 9-3 is also very safe car, aerbags are located for the driver, front row passanger and there's also aerbags on the sides.
The heater is very good as well, it only takes about 12 minutes for the car to reach normal room temperature from minus 12 celsius degrees.
The top speed for Saab 9-3 has been estimated to be 235 km/ hour or 146,8 mph.

Here's some numbers I gave to my car ( numbers are from 4 to 10 )

Control of your car              9
The brakes                          9
Going forward in snow       9
Consumption of gasoline   7
Heater                                  8
Electric heaters                   9
winter accessories             9

      General estimate of Saab 9-3      8,5

Spear parts for Saab can be expencive in the States but here in Scandinavia they're quite cheap
What else can I say, I love my car!
