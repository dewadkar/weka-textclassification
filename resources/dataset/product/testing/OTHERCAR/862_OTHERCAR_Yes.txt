            I had a need for a digital camera that would take a picture immediately when I pressed the button (no waiting on a green light.) The SONY 340L would not immediately take the picture because I had to wait on the focus, and then I had to wait again before taking the next picture. I take pictures of dogs and they rarely set still for very long.

The C-3000 Zoom gives you the option of shutter speed and all other SLR functions. I'm not a professional photographer but I did know I had to have a better camera.

I was amazed at how easy it was to learn how to use the C-3000. At first, I was worried because it had so many buttons, dials, and settings. When I first took the camera out of the box, I almost immediately took some pictures on the default settings to see what would happen. The images weren't quite what I wanted, it took me another 5 minutes or so, to look in the manual and find out how to set the camera to take the best images (I was in the house at the time.) After less than 1 hour I knew how to set the camera for use in any lighting conditions and subject.

The camera uses 4 AA batteries which can save a lot of money compared to other cameras. My pictures are for the internet and it may seem excessive to pay so much for a camera when the pictures will only be viewed at 72 to 150dpi, but as stated earlier I needed the capability to control shutter speed and the aperture setting. The C-3000 gives me complete control. The only thing to hate is the lens cap. It's to easy to forget it and leave it laying somewhere (they should have put a hinge on it.) If you take pictures of moving objects, like pets or children, then you want go wrong with the C-3000.

THE FOLLOWING IS ADDED AFTER USING THE CAMERA FOR OVER A MONTH.

I forgot to mention the software that came with the camera for downloading the images and the external power source.

First, the software installed with little hassle or input. After hooking up the camera to the USB cable (which I leave hooked up to the computer) you start up the CAMEDIA 2.0 software. After a couple of clicks the pictures are downloaded and ready for preview. You can select which images to download or select all images and where to download to. The speed of the download is very fast (thanks to USB.) I appreciate the fact that it is smart enough to continue the numbering of the images in sequence if previous downloaded images are in the folder.

Second, I was disappointed that Olympus didn't include a AC adapter. I was lucky that my other camera had a AC adapter and that it worked with this one. I use the adapter when downloading and deleting or viewing the images I've taken.

Third, I'm still completely satisfied with the camera. In fact, I look for excuses to take pictures.<br><br>
