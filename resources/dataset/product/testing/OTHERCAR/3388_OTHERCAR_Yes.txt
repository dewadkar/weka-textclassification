            Can life get any better than this?????  I've waited for years to be able
to afford the car of my dreams and now I have it in the Jaguar XK8 Convertible......

This car has the sexiest lines I've ever seen in a car and every thing
is done perfectly.  

The wood grain dash is very classy, the Harmon-Kardon sound system is
second to none with a 6 disc CD changer in the trunk.  The leather
interior is beautifully crafted and they thought about just everything
a girl could need.

I love the fact that I can make phone calls, adjust my music volume and
change stations all with the push of a button on my steering wheel.  I
can't imagine why all car makers haven't thought of this.  Not to mention
the convenience of it all but the safety factor is a major one.  No more
looking down to switch stations, just easily push the button on my
steering wheel and there ya go....

The integrated, voice activated phone system is also another major plus
to this vehicle.  All I need to do is push the button on the steering
wheel......say &quot;call home&quot; and it automatically dials home  for me.  The
phone speaker is right next to my sun visor so it makes for easy hands
free phone calls.....which again is another major safety factor in addition to convenience.  

And when it comes time to putting the convertible top down.....well there
I have two options.....I can either do it from the outside just by putting
my key into the drivers side door and turning it......or from the inside
with just the push of a button.....nothing to unclip or pull down!!!

The car has needed very little maintenance and it drives DEAD quiet and
smooth.  

I would highly recommend this car to anyone who was interested.<br><br>
