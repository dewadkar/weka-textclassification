              The Dodge Durango in my mind is flawless for a sports utility vehicle. Depending on what you are going to use it for should determine whether you shall buy the two wheel drive or the four wheel drive. Depending whether you have a boat , or something to tow there is a selection of engines to choose from. The Durango is also built for different age groups as it has three different classes of interior and exterior styling.
  

  If I could afford a Durango , I would go with the two wheel drive 5.2 liter engine. I would also purchase the sport model with no tow package and leave the dealership with a great deal on a weekend sale Durango. The reason for the sport model is because the sport model doesn't have the home link tranciever up top. I live in an apartment so I wouldn't need a garage door opener ,  I hardly where sun glasses , and I have a sense of direction without a fear of getting lost. I would pick the two wheel drive because I would never use four wheel drive unless I go to Tahoe twice in a year which hardly occurs , I would rather put chains on than pay an extra three to four thousand dollars on four wheeling. I currently don't own a boat or jet skis , so the tow package would do me no good right now. I also wouldn't need a third row because I wouldn't be carrying that many people with me. I would have a great looking sport utility vehicle at a great price. What i described to you is the strip down model but all the extra accessories wouldn't fit my needs.
  

  Other people need the four wheel drive , the power door locks , power seats , leather interior , home link tranceiver , tow package , and the 5.9 liter engine. This type of person would be able to afford a price of a thirty thousand plus vehicle. This person would probably want the four wheel drive to either use it or for resale value later on. Then again they will walk out the dealership paying over $30000. <br><br>
