            Overall I have to say that I am happy with this camera. It was easy to use & learn, the photo quality is brilliant - I never knew colors could be so real on a digital camera! The battery pack lasts around 2 hours, & recharges in less than half that time. It's size makes it easily portable but not so small that fingers get in the way of photos. The cost is reasonable for Sony quality & the considerable resale value of Sony cameras. 
The standard Sony purchase package comes with enough to get you started. Namely a strap, an 8mb memory stick, lens cap, battery / charger & usb & video cables. 
Most of the drawbacks have to do with what's in (or not in) the box as well. First off 8mb is relatively useless. I was able to get 5 pictures in the largest size on the stick. I promptly acquired a larger one. Second, Photo Suite is an annoying program. If you are serious, spend the money & get Adobe Photo Shop Or Corel Photo. Third, a case would be nice! Fortunately this camera is an average size & for 10.00 I got a perfectly suitable case at Wal-Mart. 
The flash, although adjustable, is really really bright. I don't like washed out skin tones & this has been a problem for me thus far. 
The shutter delay was hard to get used to. Now it isn't such a problem, but initially it upset me! 
I miss having a movable LCD display! I really hope that Sony puts it back on their next Cybershot camera because learning to live without it is exceptionally difficult. 
All in all it's a great little camera that takes great big pictures. If you are considering purchasing it I don't think you will be disappointed!
