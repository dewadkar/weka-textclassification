            When I went shopping for a digital camera I was looking for an inexpensive camera that would take great shots and was easy to use.  At the first computer shop I went to I was overwhelmed with the selection and realized that there were many things I didn't know about digital cameras.  I was confused about which required cards and which didn't, what the different features meant and how they operated.  I decided to do more research before making a purchase.   

I stumbled upon the Polaroid Photo Max PDC-700 at WalMart of all places!  This is the camera to buy if you are feeling clueless about which camera to go for.  It's easy to use, takes great pictures and at $210 was very inexpensive.  It is easily uploadable, and allows up to upload either all the pictures or just one at a time.  The only thing that could be done to improve the camera would be to expand the instructions.  There are a couple buttons that I'm still not quite sure about!<br><br>
