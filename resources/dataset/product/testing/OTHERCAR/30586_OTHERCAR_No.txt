                 I have been an advocate of Japanese engineering for quite some time. Starting with the Datsun Maxima in 1981,then a Datsun/Nissan pick-up in 1984,and a Mazda 626 in 1991, I have been amazed at the durability and reliability of these vehicles. My pick-up truck had over 240,000 miles before I gave it to my gardener because I didn't care to repair the brakes. It still had the original clutch and virtually no engine work other than a minor tune up and a fuel pump problem at about 115,000 miles.
     So I had expectations of a similar experience with the Honda Odyssey I purchased in 1995. Regretfully, this is not the case. There has been problem after problem with this vehicle. Some have been rectified while others are something an owner will have to learn to live with.
     This is my wife's vehicle that she uses to shuttle kids to school, run to the market, and tool around town in. Therefore, I don't expect very high gas mileage. But 15-16 seems a bit low for a 4 banger. However, that is tolerable for  the comfort and room it affords. Now let me run down a list of items that aren't as readily accepted.

     1. There is no ventilation unless the air-conditioner is running. (the honda techs say that is because the outside air is vented across the engine. what kind of design is that?)

     2. The arm rests are anchored so flimsy that they break after very short usage. ( the honda service people say that is a design flaw that cannot be remedied so they advise me not to use the arm rests.)

     3. the ABS system has begun leaking at 50,000 miles.( the honda service people say that is a common and expected occurence.)

     4. the stereo system sounds as if the tuner has drifted slightly from the intended station. this with a digital tuner. plus, this is the second radio as the first one lost the left channel within the first week after we purchased the vehicle.( this is the ex model with the so-called premium stereo system.

     5. the sun roof has an opening of 7-7.5 inches because of the rear air conditioner. if there is a full moon at night, it's hardly possible to see the entire thing through that tiny opening

     6. now, at 52,000 miles the oilpan has a leaky gasket and the front motor mount is broken.  it is a 400 dollar repair job at the honda service. God, I wish i had my datsun pick-up back.
