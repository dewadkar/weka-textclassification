            Ive had this camera for 3 months now. I absolutely love it. I got a 8 meg and 16 meg. I still  have the 8 mg and haven't filled it up yet. Got about 20 pic on it and set to low resolution.  I cant believe the excellent quality of the pictures in this setting. I have emailed to friends and family and they agree.
Also I see others have complained about red eye. Sorry I dont get red eye in my pictures. I have done may indoor and the quality is superb.
The camera is small and that is why I chose it. I checked out some of the Sony and they are way to big. Yes they may have larger LCD, but so what and they weigh a ton. I wanted something smaller but not too small like other cameras.
The software works great and I upload quickly with USB. Only beef is this uses batteries like they are going out of style. So I finally listened to what others said and bought for $20 an ac adapter from Ebay. 
Anyway, check this one out. I am a happy camper.
