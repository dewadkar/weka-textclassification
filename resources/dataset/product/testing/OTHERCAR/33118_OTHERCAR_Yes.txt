            The best decision I have ever made was the purchase of my 2000 Chevy Malibu SE. I love it, the looks, the price, and the power! The SE model is well worth the few extra dollars, it comes standard with:

4 wheel Anti-lock brakes.....Dual airbags 
Split Folding Rear seat........Custom mud flaps 
Daytime running lights........Power windows 
Power drivers Seat.............Cruise Control 
Rear Window Defogger.......5 MPH Bumper 
Remote Keyless entry.........Nice Alloy Wheels 
Child Safety Locks...............Fog Lights
Back Seat Vents..................Air Conditioning
AM/FM, tape, CD Player.......V6 engine
Power Locks........................And much more....

As you can see itï¿½s quite the impressive package, but its nothing compared to the ride itself! As a taller man, at 6'3", I needed a big car to be comfortable in, and the Malibu has plenty of room in it. I drove it from Virginia all the way up to Maine last month (aprox 1000 miles) only stopping for gas without a single problem with the car. I was averaging about 37-39 Mpg on my trip, which was great since the gas prices are so high. It was also surprising since it is a six cylinder. The ride was so quiet that I had no problems sleeping as my wife took over for a few hours. Its really hard to tell that the car is running while you sit parked, I usually have to just check the tachometer.

It has the normal 3yr, 36k bumper to bumper warrantee, with an option for 10yr 100k for an extra $800.

My only regret is that I wish I would have bought the silver myst rather than white. White would have been my second choice if I would have seen a silver myst one on the lot.

<i>Just like to make a small update to my epinion that I wrote over a year ago now.  This car has traveled many miles for its first year, about 32K.  Me and my wife were using it to travel from Virginia to Maine quite often.  Now we have it in Jolly ol' England with us, and were having a whole lot of fun riding it on the wrong side of the road!
No problems yet to speak of, what a GREAT Car I've bought!</i>
