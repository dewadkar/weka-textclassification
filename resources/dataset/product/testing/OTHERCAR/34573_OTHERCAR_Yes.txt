            Finally someone brought together small suv's and superluxury.  The inside is unreal.  Leather seats are among the most comfortable I have ever sat in.  I could drive 1000 miles in this car and still feel great.

I drive full time four wheel drive and in that way the car handles great.  Very steady on the turns.  Handles great on the highway.

What about that sound system.  If you have never driven an Infinity before, they all come with a great BOSE speaker sound system.  The sound is great.  For those of you that like to alter the interior and change speakers and decks when you buy cars, no need this one is as good as you need.  The cd deck is very touch related so you dont have to take your eyes off the road.  The dials are real easy to remember and locate so you will not have to risk your safety and the safety of your passengers to change the radio.

You want good looks.  Just sit in the driver seat of the Qx4 and you will feel like you are in heaven.  The dials and dash give you the feeling of cruising in a superluxury automobile such as a rolls.  

One problem though, and a minor one at that, the center console is very shallow and doesnt offer much room to store anything.

What about that annoying garage door opener that always falls off the visor.  Well the Qx4 has the buttons already built into the visor.  Just simply program you vehicle with the signal and three different signals are at you command everywhere you go.

The far back offers plenty of room to haul anything from luggage, to golf clubs, to your lawnmower.  How about those back seats.  Plenty of room, and just as comfortable as the front seats.

Gas mileage is marginal compared to suv's, but the car has hauling power so use it.  One problem is I hope you dont plan on racing anyone because this car accelerates like a Mac truck.  But, hey , you want to accelerate fast, buy a vette.

No problems with mine so far.  Great car.  Go buy one.
