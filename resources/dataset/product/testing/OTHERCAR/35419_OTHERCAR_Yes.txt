            The main thing that reviewers of the various Sipix mini-cameras fail to appreciate is that this thing should not be called a "digital camera" -- it just raises people's expectations.  Think of it more as an electronic version of a Polaroid instant camera.  A Polaroid can be a lot of fun in certain situations.  No one could accuse a Polaroid of taking good quality pictures and no one could accuse the Blink of taking good quality pictures either.  

That said, this is a very cool little toy.  The main value I have found in it is the ability to shoot dozens of candid shots over the course of an event and string them together into video montages.  The camera comes bundled with easy to use video software which allows you to create these short movies out of your still pictures.  All that's left to do is choose an appropriate soundtrack and you've got a great montage that documents a trip, party, football game or whatever.  These movies have proven to be far more popular with friends than a couple of boring high-quality photos.  

The Blink is so cheap as to be almost expendable... you can be a lot more carefree with a $40 camera than you would be with a $400 camera.  It is so small that it can hang comfortably around your neck, ready for constant use.  Sure, there are drawbacks such as the fact that you are limited to the 8MB of built-in memory or that there is no flash, so you cannot effectively use the camera indoors.  The battery life is acceptable using an rechargeable NiMH battery and should buy you several days of use before you should upload the pictures to your computer.  The memory is powered by the AAA battery, so you can't leave photos on this camera for an extended period.  But, that is the trade-off you will make for a $40 camera the size of a matchbook.

So, if you are creative and ever-so-slightly computer literate, you will enjoy this camera and be able to create great videos with it.  If you want a camera which can produce print-quality images, look somewhere else -- that's not what this camera is all about!
