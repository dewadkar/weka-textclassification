            We purchased the Kodak DC-25 about 3 years ago.  It was one of the first cameras to have a digital display which was why we bought the camera.  I believe we paid around $250 for it at Wal-mart.

It is very easy to use, simply turn it on via the power button, aim and shoot!  It does not show you your picture unless you press the display button.  After pressing the display button it takes about 20 seconds for your picture to load up on the display.

There are only to settings for picture quality (pixels) standard or high...don't even mess with standard, it's lousy.  We always leave ours on high.

The camera holds about 15 pictures and you can delete them one by one or delete all.  

To download the pictures onto your computer you plug your camera in to the computer via the cable that comes with the camera and use KODAK PICTURE EASY software (also comes with the camera).  We've found it takes around 4 minutes per picture to load!  You then can save the pictures on to your hard drive.  

As my title states, thankfully technology is advancing quickly and the world of digital cameras has gotten much better/faster!  Unless you are very patient with the loading time I wouldn't recommend buying this camera.  I have to also mention a few other things:  our camera was dropped and the display screen cracked in half...considering this was not a bad/hard drop this rather surprised me.  Also, the batteries are $5 each and it takes 2 batteries. This really adds up fast as the batteries don't last very long since it relies on them while downloading the pictures unless you spend the money for an adapter!

I would say yes the camera works (we use it for ebay pictures, sending stuff to grandma via email, etc) but unless you find it at a garage sale don't waste the money!<br><br>
