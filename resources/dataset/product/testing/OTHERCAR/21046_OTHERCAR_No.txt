            We received our mini-van through a family member that was upgrading their vehicle 2 years ago. Since then, we have replaced nearly everything under the hood. This vehicle had 80k miles of highway driving on it. Not enough, in my opinion, to require replacing the engine, transmission, and radiator. Though the handling is excellent, very much like my Dad's Cadillac, we have a hard time reaching 70mph when accessing the highway. As far as cargo room is concerned, it is quite sad. I can not fit a cooler and a Graco stroller in the back. The stroller wheels are too large. There is no leg room in the third row and that's just as well as we mostly use it for extra cargo. I like the cruise control and speaker system, but I wish the vehicle was a little more reliable. Also, my paint job refuses to stay on the car, manuf. defect I was told.
