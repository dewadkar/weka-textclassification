            Hi,

I've had this car since it was brand new in 1995.  Never ever have I made a repair nor has it broken down.  My car is the 5 spd. manual it looks like the autotransmissions were problematic according the reviews on epinions.

I wish I had purchased an automatic because I get tired of shifting but that is not the car's fault.  My friend has a 626 which is even older than mine and it is still running.  The repairs she has made were accident induced.

I love this car but need a larger one now.  The only bad thing I would say is that the paint looks very old on my car but it is not peeling or anything.  I replaced the tires with Pirelli's which I found cut the road noise to a minimum.  The seats are comfortable and this car is totally reliable.  It really should be rated more highly in Consumer Reports.  I would not hesitate to buy this if you find one with a good history.
