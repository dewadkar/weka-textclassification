            This is the first car I have owned. After learning to drive on my parents' cars, a 95 Ford Windstar (a tank) and a 94 Chrysler Concorde (also a tank), driving this was like a dream. And it still is.

It handles incredibly well. It goes in a straight line (something that our Windstar doesn't like to do), turns almost on a dime, and gets great gas mileage.

When we bought this car, it came with the factory stereo system. I replaced the head unit with an Aiwa CD player, and the sound is excellent. However, I don't drive with the volume all the way up; I prefer to listen at a reasonable level. The speakers can handle this - and more.

There is plenty of trunk space, although it's hard to fit people into the back seat. Gas mileage is excellent. And heck, it looks good. It accelerates incredibly well. 

Finally, it's easy to maintain. Change your oil, make sure you have gas, and replace the timing belt at 90,000 miles and you'll be fine. This car has a reputation for running well.

The only problems? I hear that the back columns can be in a troublesome location for shorter people. The car can get noisy at times (though not mechanically, and even when you do hit the accelerator hard, the engine is one of the best I've ever heard). It rides low, and getting into and out if it isn't exactly the easiest thing to do. However, these are just minor problems in my opinion.

Acura has made a happy customer out of me, and once I have to give up my car, either when I go to college or it finally breaks down, I'll probably be buying another Integra.
