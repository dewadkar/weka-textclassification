            I really have enjoyed my Jeep.  I purchased the car 12 months ago, because I needed a vehicle with more space for passengers, as well as space for two dogs.  The Jeep has worked very well for me.  I love the extra features for trip planning, and have used the vehicle to travel from California to Wyoming and Colorado and back, with two adults, a 4 year old, two dogs, and all our camping gear.  My old complain regarding the Jeep would be the low mileage per gallon (because of 4 wheel drive) and the fact that the model I have (1997) had the spar tire upright in the back cargo area, thus taking away cargo space.

I would recommend this vehicle to my friends, and in fact two of my friends have purchased a Jeep after my recommending them, and both are very happy with the Jeep.

I would recommend the vehicle for anyone.  It is a very safe car, with great control especially in poor weather condition (rain, snow, mud).  The back seat is easily accessible for the driver to look back and see a child in a child seat in the back (for safety), and thus it is great for children under 4.<br><br>
