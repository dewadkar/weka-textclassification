            This camera (the Olympus D-460Z) has caused me all sorts of headaches... I love to use it so much that I've been compelled to buy all sorts of accessories that I can't afford.  I purchased it because it felt good to me; compact, attractive, nice pictures, no lens cap to lose...  Since that fateful day, however, I've made many trips back to Best Buy.  I bought more memory cards (8 MB isn't nearly enough), a battery recharger (that screen is so fun to use), a SanDisk USB Smartmedia card reader (I didn't like having to plug my camera in constantly, and this is so much faster), photo paper, a case, and the worst... a new HP deskjet 970cse (what's the point of having this awesome camera without its printing equal?).

Truly, though, this camera is great (and I've heard the new Olympus models are even better!).  It is small and light enough to fit in my purse, and I don't have to worry about it turning itself on (you have to slide the lens cover over to turn it on), or scratching the lens.  The battery consumption is pretty good with the screen on, and excellent without it.  The picture quality is great, and the autofocus seems to be better than most cameras.  The optical zoom is something that I now realize I can't live without, it puts the digital zoom on most cameras to shame.  The different light and picture settings are easy to access, the menu system is very easy to use.  I was/am a digital photo novice, but I don't foresee  my self outgrowing this camera anytime soon. <br><br>
