            My dh and I purchased the Venture LS in June 1998.  Little did we know we would really need it when I got pregnant again 4 months later.  We looked everywhere at all different models before deciding on this van.  The financing was wonderful (1.9%),but the van is even better.  The joy of driving this vehicle is miraculous.  It holds 7 people comfortably, or you can do like I did and take out the back seats to have more storage area.  The groceries, strollers, etc. all fit with ease.  I've even carried a motor in the back.  LOL  I love the adjustability of the driver's seat, and all of the accessories are within arms reach.  We got the &quot;loaded&quot; model and have loved every feature.  I have only done routine maintenance on this vehicle and have had no problems at all.  The horsepower is right up there with the sedans. The size of this vehicle doesn't hold you back on the road.<br><br>
