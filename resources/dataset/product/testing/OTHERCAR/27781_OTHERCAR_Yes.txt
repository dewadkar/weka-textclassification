            Overall, this is a fantastic buy. I've owned this camera since October of 2001 and have gotten a lot of use out of it.  

The quality of the pictures it takes are good, even when you leave it in its default setting which takes the most number of pictures but gives you the lowest resolution.  

The camera is easy to use, very intuitive.  You don't need to read the directions and yet it gives a lot of control.  

If you're like me then you use your camera most when you travel, and you learn quickly that size does matter.  This camera fits in my pockets easily and even the tiniest of my girlfriend's designer purses (it's so small, she doesn't even complain about carrying it).  It's a little heavy for it's size but not enough to be a nuisance to carry like most others are. 

This camara is also very durable.  I don't abuse things, but I've put this through the heavy travel test and it has survived drops and falls without a scratch or any internal damage -- very solid casing!

COMPLAINTS

First, the 8 meg compact flash card provided is too small, I recommend buying a bigger one.  I use a 64 meg card which is more than adequate.

My second complaint is that it is difficult to take pictures really quickly.  This may sound like a silly complaint to the digital camara guru who might claim this is a problem with all digital camara's with auto focus, but I don't know, I'm only offering my opinion as an ordinary user.  If you're on a safari tour bus and you're trying to take a quick shot with a 2 second window of opportunity, don't count on getting a clear, high quality picture - sometimes I luck out. 

The battery life isn't great, but decent enough to last through a heavy day of pictures. It's good considering how small it is. I also like to review pictures a lot on the dgital display, which is fun but it uses up batteries. It's probably worth getting a backup battery since the battery itself is so small.

My final complaint is the zoom.  This camara zooms up to 4 times actual distance.  It's fine for most cases but when you really want to capture something, like a monkey hanging from a tree in the distance at the zoo it can be tough to see.  I guess I was spoiled by my brother's Cannon Powershot which zooms up to 9 times (it's much larger though and costs over $100 more).
