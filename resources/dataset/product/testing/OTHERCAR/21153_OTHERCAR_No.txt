            After driving Volvo cars for over 30 years and owning eleven Volvo models, I was thrilled to be able to afford a brand new 1998 Volvo S90, the fleet flagship at the time. I took delivery in August of 1997 and was thoroughly enjoying the experience until problems began to appear. Brake problems were an ongoing issue with warping rotors and ridiculously short pad life (one set lasted only 4500 miles).  It was a constant battle with the dealer to replace these items under warranty since they are viewed as "consumables". The car was in the shop fourteen times during the warranty period, five times just for brake problems. The sun roof failed twice and failed again after the warranty period had expired. Both power seats failed. The passenger's seat required a module replacement under warranty. The driver's seat failed at 60000 miles and the repair quote was $425.00. The engine developed an oil leak which was repaired under warranty but the car was out of commission for a week. Two modules failed which disabled the car completely. The A/C controller acted up and turned the heat on when air conditioned was selected. It has required over $2500 in repairs since the warranty expired. The car now has 66000 miles on it. There has been no satisfaction from the dealer nor any support from Volvo North America. On the positive side of things, the S90 is a beautifully appointed car, with soft leather upholstery, artificial wood accents and virtually no accessory lacking. The sound system is above reproach. It is roomy with a cavernous trunk. It comes standard with front and side air bags and rear passenger head restraints that really are restraints. Handling is superb for a vehicle of this size. Fuel economy is mediocre however but Volvo has never been known for fuel economy. There is a factory requirement for premium fuel but I've used regular grade with no problems. From the perspective of a long-time Volvo owner, this car is a definite disappointment.
