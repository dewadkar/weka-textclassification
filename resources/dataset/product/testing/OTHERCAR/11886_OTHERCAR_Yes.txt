            This is not only a product, but a company.  My first experience with the Agfa 780c was when Agfa sent it to me as a replacement for the 780 that I had accidentally dropped.  That camera was over a year old and out of warranty.  Nevertheless, the company sent me a new 780c for $99.00 plus shipping.  Boy, was I happy!

The 780c has the same features as the 780 but comes in a much better looking bluish/silver-toned body.  It is not a &quot;megapixel&quot; camera, so I would not recommend it for print work.  But, since I am a Web Page designer where the max. resolution that I need is only 72 dpi, it works great.  The colors are vibrant.  You can see some of the pics I've taken with it at my web site: www.chrisopfell.com/ckolaw.htm.  Judge for yourself!

The camera comes with a standard 2 MB Smart Card, which I upgraded to 8 MB quite inexpensively.  Now it holds 45 Hi-Res pics and about 390 Low-Res ones.  There is also an intermediate setting.

Even at this low price, the camera comes with a 1.8 inch LCD color monitor on the back which lets you delete bad photos at will, and includes thumbnail views.  The LCD also doubles as a viewfinder, but that runs the 4 AA batteries down quickly, so I don't recommend it.

On the downside, the 780c does not have Auto-Focus.  So you have to set the distance setting manually.  This can be a pain if you forget to do it and have to retake a rare live shot.  Also, the flash is a little weak.  The best pictures taken are in daylight.

The included Photowise software is fairly comprehensive and allows a great deal of editing to be done.  It is also easy to make prints by uploading the files to a place like Ofoto.com (which gives several free prints as an introduction to their service.)

The 780c does not come with a carrying case and I strongly recommend you get one.  It is fairly small for a digital camera with an LCD and is easy to drop, as I found out!

Otherwise, for someone who does alot of work on the Web, or likes to e-mail photos to friends and family, this is a great buy.  There is nothing else at this price point which competes with it!
