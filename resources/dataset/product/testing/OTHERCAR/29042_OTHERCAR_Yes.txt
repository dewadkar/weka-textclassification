            I bought this vehicle.. well actually my parents brought it for me, in my senior year in high school (Jan 2000). You can have the feel of an SUV without the gas guzzling and the behemoth size of one. It has great gas mileage: 22 city 25 highway. The built in table is totally cool (hidden under the cargo space) and has a power outlet in the cargo area.( u can watch your portable Tv or make something w/ your microwave!!) There's even armrests for the back passengers!

There are some things that really bug me: 
passenger armrest not included!!!
non painted door handles &amp; side veiw mirrors (LX model only)
Lack of power: only 146 HP!!!! (its a honda, what do u expect ;))
And other subtle things that you don't realize on the first test drive
It seems like the seats where made for small people, i cant get comfortable!!!!

I recommend this car for for mostly college students: it fits your budget (esp. gas) You can go camping, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, et cetra, et cetra. you name it, YOU CAN DO IT !<br><br>
