            I bought my 96 green Neon in 1998 as my first car. I just got my Driver's license and I was thrilled to buy my own car. I saw this bright green Neon standing at the car dealer waiting to meet a new owner. The price seemed good and after several discussions with the dealer, I and my parents were able to knock of thousands bucks off the original price. 
After few months of ride:
My Neon didn't have a CD player and since I love music, I bought SONY CD player. Few weeks later, someone broke into my car and took my CD player. Fortunately, my insurance paid for my CD player. Few weeks later someone broke into my car AGAIN, he or she didn't still my CD player this time, just left some damage. Again, I called the police and the insurance. I found out that it is so easy to break into Neons(even I could do it easily). So finally I bought an Alarm system for my car. 
Problems starting to show up:
I was able to take my friends out with my Neon and it was great to have a car until My little Neon started to show problems. First,on down hill,my car just died, the engine just died for no reason.About few months later I had flat tire,then one morning my battery died -in result I was late for school and missed half of my morning class-. Ok, flat tires and dead battery  would be some problems that other cars might have too but after I fixed all of those problems, I had another. My break started to have squeaky sounds-another big dollars- then after months, my engine oil was leaking-another thousand dollars-. After all that, I thought that the problems were over but no Way, I could hear some kind of squeaky sound from both front and rear wheels. I took my car to Chrysler again and fixed it-another hundreds of dollars and hours of waiting at dealer shop-. I had enough with those problems. I don't love my Neon anymore and I am not taking any of my friends with my car, I don't want to harm them. 
Pros:
One of the reason that I bought Neon was because it was cheap. It actually has a good fuel economy. When it first came out,,I thought that it was good looking car(but Y2K models looks terrible!). Trunks size is reasonable for this class.
Cons:
Safety features in this car is horrible. It has poor crash test result and it is so much easy to break into this car. It is too noisy inside, because of the engine sound, I can not listen to music. The handling isn't great I feel like I am driving a tank. And mine doesn't have power windows-it is so much pain since my parents car have power windows-. This car doesn't have much interior features even tachometer isn't in my car. 
And now:
One of my friend bought her Neon several months ago, she bought exactly same colour as my car.If I knew that she was buying Neon,I would have stop her. I believed in Chrysler and I bought my Dodge Neon because I trusted them. I am not going to buy any of Chrysler car again. Their service wasn't bad but it wasn't best either. My advice to anyone-who is considering Neon- is forget about this car. There are tons of other great cars that you can get at this price range.I loved my car and took good care of her but I had to spend huge amount of money and time to fix problems which was not necessary. I just spend too much time, effort, and money on my Neon so that both my parents and I both got tired, so my parents helped me to get a brand new Hyundai Tiburon. 
   The bottom line is Don't buy NEON. Neon is a lemon.
