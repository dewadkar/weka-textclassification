                                    THE NUBIRA ON TEST

A relative newcomer to the Irish market, the Korean built Daewoo Nubira competes favourably on price and specification with both its Japanese and European cousins.
There are four cars in the range, the 1.6 S.E. and the 2.0 C.D.X. saloons, and the estate versions of the same.  
Daewoo cars were at one time based on the cast-off designs of General Motors, but that�s not true any more. They are totally engineered and designed by the Korean manufacturer, and to very exacting standards indeed.
So what about the drivability? It is a refined and comfortable car, with good performance and excellent fuel economy.
The specifications are comprehensive. Air-conditioning, dual driver and passenger airbags, A.B.S. brakes, remote central locking, alarm, side impact bars, heated mirrors, and an engine immobiliser are all fitted as standard. If you have yet to experience the joys of air-conditioning, you will be a convert the first time you use it to demist your car. It is far more effective than a heater alone, which leaves the vehicle feeling like the inside of a sauna.
Your safety is well catered for, and if you are unlucky enough to be involved in a �shunt� the dual airbags and side impact bars both give you that extra bit of added protection.
The A.B.S. (anti-lock) braking system can help you avoid that most feared accident,the rear end collision. Lost no-claim bonuses and whiplash claims are a drivers� nightmare in our litigation conscious society.
Leather upholstery and trim can be purchased as an extra on the C.D.X., as can an electric slide and tilt sunroof. The leather seats are an option well worth considering.
If you are a sun-worshipper then the tilt and slide sunroof is for you. There are electric windows all round on the C.D.X., and on the front only on the S.E. version, while the estate has a rear integrated wash and wipe.

It is a good looker, with metallic paint, colour coded bumpers and side protection strips, a distinctive chrome grill, and integrated headlights and front bumper. All again at no extra cost! All versions come with a high mounted rear stop lamp, and the C.D.X. also includes front fog lamps as standard, both again useful safety features. Alloy wheels are standard on both the saloon and estate models of the C.D.X.
A R.D.S. radio/cassette stereo is fitted in all models, with the C.D.X. having  a six speaker sound system. 
�Will ya give us some sounds driver?� You can really blow them away with the six-speaker system. It�s like being in the front row of an �Oasis� concert. 
Comfort levels are high, with the drivers� seat having lumbar support, and height and tilt adjustments, an extremely useful addition for drivers who spend long periods behind the wheel.
Another useful extra is the cup-holder for your in car cup of coffee. There is more than ample space in the rear seat for three adult passengers, and leg room is OK. Boot (trunk) space is superb.If you have a large family or need extra space the estate car is the one to go for. There is room in the tail for about 5 to 8 suitcases (depending on size). The estate also has roof rails as standard, which gives even greater luggage capacity.
The handling is crisp, the power steering light and responsive, the ride quiet and smooth, and the performance impressive. With the 1.6 litre you will go from 0 to 62 M.P.H. in eleven seconds, while in the 2.0 litre you will do the same in a zippy nine seconds.
It maintains good levels of torque or pulling power at low engine speeds. The 5 speed manual gearbox is a delight, and for city driving a 4 speed automatic box is an optional extra on the C.D.X. Fuel economy is quoted at a frugal 36.2 M.P.G. and 32.5 M.P.G. for the 1.6 and 2.0 litre respectively.
The Daewoo Nubira has a lot going for it, especially its exceptional price and high specification levels.It offers more for less, compared to most of its familiar opposition.

P.S. This was a review I had published in the &quot;Irish Taxi&quot; magazine, which I have shortened and changed somewhat,removing some of the &quot;taxi&quot; references.
