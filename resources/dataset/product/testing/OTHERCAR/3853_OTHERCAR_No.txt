                    The Mercury Tracer is a pretty car and it has some pick up,but that's were the pros end. It seems you can never find the part you need for the car. Ford makes sure that you go through HELL to get the right part for your car. The interior is all wrong. For example, there is no arm rest for the driver in the LS model. If you are 5'8&quot; the car is almost impossible to drive and if you wanted to make modifications to the car: that would be impossible because there are no parts to buy. Now if you had a mazda you could get all kinds of KITS for your mazda, but if it's a ford they have NOTHING!!! It seems as if Ford supports only mazda and totally ignores Mercury! 
                     
          The Mercury Tracer seems to be built only for mechanics. If the layman wants to work on his\her car they almost always have to take to a shop. The shops almost never have the part. The Tracer is probably the most difficult mid-size car to manage. This is a car for OLD people; not young folk. One more thing, It costs too MUCH!!!!!!!!!!! I see why they discontinued it! <br><br>
