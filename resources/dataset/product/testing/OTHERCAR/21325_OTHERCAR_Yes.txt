            Our decision to purchase a new car was driven by the need for more room (a new baby), so a mid-sized passenger car was the ticket.  We quickly determined we wanted a 4 door sedan, V-6 engine, and 5-speed transmission.  That narrowed the field to really 2 choices in our price range:  The Mazda 626 and Toyota Camry. After a test drive of each (automatics, no 5-speeds on the lot) my wife felt the Camry was much more car and we agreed to purchase one.

Now, since our desired model of a V-6 and 5-speed were not on any dealers' lots near us, I ended up using one of the Internet services to buy our car. In fact, we got more car than we really planned to, but in retrospect I am really pleased with our purchase.  They ended up ordering a Camry with the &quot;sport package&quot; for us - a LE V-6 5-speed with every option (I think the only other ones on the XLE are power seats and traction control, and a CD changer, but I did not want those anyway).  Plus it has custom star shaped alloy wheels that are really rare and look awesome.

First off - this car is fast.  I drive a 1995 Probe GT, my wife's old car, and the Camry will blow the doors off it.  The V-6 has lots of torque and pulls great.  I am sure automatic owners are plenty pleased with their cars as well.  Our Camry is very quiet and rides smoothly.  The car has been defect free from day one.  The ETR/CD/Cassette stereo is excellent. I really like the leather seats - they comfortable even on long trips.

Dislikes:  uummm, I'm thinking.  OK, I have two.  ONE - The car is not a sports car, even with a sports package.  It corners fine with moderate body roll.  But the steering seems a bit dead to me.  You really don't feel the car turn when moving the steering off center, and then BOOM, you get more turn than you expected.  My wife says she never feels this, but she drives it every day and probably has adjusted.  I have to transition from the Probe to the Camry often and notice it more.  TWO - the shifter is notchy.  It works great, but it is not buttery smooth like my old Accord was or even my 5-speed Probe.

Overall this is a fantastic car.  We average about 28 mpg on the highway and 20-22 in the city.  Families with up to 3 young children should consider this car.  The back seat is fine for adults, but limit the load to 4 persons if the trip is very long.  The trunk is large and holds what we need (wait until the next child!!).  If you haul older children often or several adults you might want to consider the Avalon, or a minivan or something bigger.

ONE NOTE: to get the maximum performance out of the V-6 you must use premium fuel (91 octane or higher).  It makes a big difference in how powerful the motor feels, so consider that as an additional cost if you are thinking about a V-6 Camry.
