            In 1996 there were not many SUVs with full time 4WD:  Ford Explorer, Mitsubishi Montero, and the Jeep.  I wasn't satisfied with either the Ford or Mitsu, so the choice fell square upon Jeep's shoulders.  Why full-time 4WD?  Mostly for my wife who liked the idea of automatically having four wheel power when needed without having to push a button or throw a lever.  (like my older Pathfinder required)

At first blush, the Jeep GC limited is a very eye-catching vehicle - subtle lines with nice wheels that really stand out.  The Jeep designers really did an excellent job of creating one of the best looking trucks on the road today.  But love at first sight is empty without substance, so I made a number of test drives to determine if this was to be my next new car.  The initial feel and drive were very impressive. With the Jeep's amazing 5.2L V8 pumping out 230HP, it would literally jump from the line and out ahead of traffic!  Very impressive power, and yet when not pushing the pedal down into the floor, the V8 would return fuel economy similar to the standard I6 engine.  The powerful engine did a lot to earn my vote.  Handling was slightly below my older Pathfinder, but not by much.  Turns were fairly tight and crisp with a touch of body roll expected from any SUV.

The interior was nice and plush, but had a cheap plastic look and feel about it.  Fit and finish were a bit sub-par as some pieces would shift out of place or not fit correctly.  (these have turned into rattles and misc. noises today)  The front power seats felt nice and soft with plenty of space, the rear seat much less so.  Those comfy front seats get a bit too soft on long trips, reducing comfort.  I loved the Limited's steering wheel radio controls and superb sounding Infinity stereo system with single CD player and tape deck. (other companies need to duplicate these steering wheel mounted controls)  Hated the rear seat cup holder that prevents access to the armrest storage console when in use.  The very adept climate control heated or cooled the interior quickly, including rear seat passengers via floor mounted ducts.  Cargo space was limited (no pun intended) thanks to the full size spare eating up part of the left side, but still seemed adequate for most needs.

Overall, an impressive package:  power, looks, convenience, and, dare I say it, a bit of prestige.  Seemed like a winner in all ways.  Consumer Reports listed the '96's as &quot;average&quot; repair reliability, so everything seemed in order.

After negotiating with the dealership for approximately 5 days, we finally drove our new Jeep home and immediately began to realize what the statement &quot;it's a Jeep thing...&quot; truly means: problems.  For the first two years of ownership, the vehicle suffered over 40 trips to the dealership to correct poor workmanship and quality, including the following items:  roof rack rattled loudly, wandering alignment, faulty transfer case lever, numerous engine reprogramming efforts, mass airflow sensors, numerous air conditioning problems, multiple drive line problems including three (yes, 3!) new rear differentials, multiple HVAC control replacements, seat control problems, gaskets, seals, sensors, and many others.  (some are still not fixed properly!)  Apparently I'm not the only one with these problems as the dealer's service manager has mentioned on several occasions that Grand Cherokees, especially those with the Quadra-Trac 4WD system, are notoriously unreliable, and are more frequently found in the shop than the mountains. (new JGC shoppers take note that this includes the redesigned 1999+ model as well) 

What a disappointment this vehicle was, especially when Consumer Reports gave it an &quot;average&quot; reliability record!  (that record has changed lately to reflect the poor reliability myself and others have experienced - it is now the least reliable SUV on the market)  The vehicle's handling is now very loose and wanders about, something that seems to get worse with age, and requires the driver's full attention in traffic.  There are still plenty of problems (mostly driveline related) with this vehicle that I will have to pay to be repaired.  Working with the dealership has not helped much, but persistance pays off if you want to have Chrysler pay for any out of warranty repair.  Prospective Jeep owners be warned - these vehicles are not reliable and they have the history to prove it!  Don't believe me?  Check out http://www.alldata.com and view the list of recalls and service bulletins related to Jeeps and read the reviews from any non-biased source such as cartalk.com.  Knowledge is power, search the truth out.

For those Jeep Grand Cherokee owners who disagree with me, I hope you have one of the rare &quot;good&quot; Jeeps that were made.  (Every once in awhile someone claims to have one - usually they just purchased the vehicle and have no history built up yet)  Odds are you don't.  And for any problem you haven't experienced, you probably soon will.  I purchased my JGC new in April of 1996 with 101 miles on the odometer and am a fanatic about vehicle maintenance:  changing oil every 3K miles, checking fluid levels frequently, and adhering to Jeep's &quot;severe&quot; service schedule.  As with most SUVs, almost all mileage was accumulated on the highway.  Currently there are 61K miles on the odometer and I have logged over 50 trips to the dealership, each with a viable problem that required attention. 
 
I really wanted to love this vehicle with it's great looks and powerful engine.  When a Jeep runs, you're in love.  When problem after problem arises, you begin to question your sanity.  When others experience similar problems, you realize its not you with the problem, its Jeep.  How Chrysler can continue to sell so many of these unreliable vehicles is beyond me.  Hopefully this message will enlighten those temped by Jeeps looks and initial performance.  I know many Jeep owners who feel they threw away $30,000; don't be the next.<br><br>
