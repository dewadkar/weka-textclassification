            The Saab 9-3 is a great and reliable car.  Saab breaks through on this one.  This car is just magnificant on tight turns at high speeds.  This car has wonderful interior design and great accesories.  I have a radar detector installed so that when the cops try to pull me over this car can react great.  Great stopping, slowing down, and wonderful accelleration. I also had a cd player installed and the speakers on this car are stupendous.  In the back seat is enough room to fit comfortably about 3 people.  There is so much room throughout the entire car.You cant go wrong with this car.  It is a great buy at a great price.<br><br>
