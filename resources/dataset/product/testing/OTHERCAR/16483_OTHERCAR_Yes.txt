             I decided to buy a Mereury sable manly for its size. The station wagon has more size than most mid-size SUVs, and has alot of space in the back. I have had ownen my Mercury for more than 8 years and it's still running
like new.
 I love how spacious the front seat is, and the speakers in the way-back, so music can be heard throughout the car. The only setback to this nearly perfect car, is that it is only 2-wheel drive. It is very comfortable in this car even at high speeds on highways. I have found it very relaxing when in this car on long car trips. 
 This car is perfect for families with many children (fitting 7, 8 using the middle seat in the front). I cant think of anyone who shoulnt buy this vehicle, but it is best for families
 This is a great car, and i hope you get one and enjoy it as long as I have<br><br>
