            The body is well finished and shows no trace of rust.  The paint still shines and is not dull anywhere.  There are no rattles and all panels fit together nicely.  I wish I could say that about the interior which shows broken/cracked plastic that occurs almost daily!  With 150K miles the drive-train is still going strong but does require frequent maintenance it is hard to keep up with leak plugging.  The electrical system is plagued with problems as the wiring harness insulation deteriorates after a few years and it affects several of the 80s models.  The drivers seat frame has warped and I've seen this in other 760s. The car does feel safe and is fun to drive.  The turbo really provides great performance. Mileage on the highway averages about 25mpg with about 17-19 in town.
