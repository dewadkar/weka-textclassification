            I purchased my 1998 2dr soft top in Oct 99 as a leftover. I get 25-30 mpg ,I was right out there with the &quot;big boys&quot; during the snow storms last winter and I am very pleased with the fact that all I have had to do so far is get the oil changed. I'm retired so this is the perfect vehicle for me , I do some part time work here and there and this vehicle is perfect for me. I think they could up the engine size a little but for a great around town vehicle this is it. With gas prices soaring I'm glad I have this economical vehicle. I'd have to pay 3 times what I paid for this Suv to get one of the &quot;big boys&quot; and with the price of gas figured in they are just not worth it.You get a whole lot more bang for your buck with this vehicle. If I could put a little bigger engine capable of towing a small watercraft  I would be perfectly content. This vehicle isn't only for the young its also for the young at heart.After the way it performed in last years snow I would not hesitate to take it off road. I'm looking forward to many years of fun driving with this vehicle.<br><br>
