            Throughout the years, I have been interested in cars to some degree and have found myself testing out even the stupidest of cars, that I could never picture myself driving.  However, through my ventures, I have found that some of these so called, "stupid" cars have actually been quite amazing.  One of these such cars happens to be the 1999 Dodge Neon.

<b>Performance</b>

Backed by a pretty small 4 cylinder, this car actually has some impressive pickup.  I don't know if I've seen any other car, besides the Toyota Celica that has utilized a 4 cylinder and turned it into something that is actually raceable...  This is mostly a GT thing however.

The engine itself is extremely quiet.  From inside of the vehicle you hear very little engine noice and you hear very little noise from any of the other running parts.  Overall it's a very quiet beast.

<b>Handling</b>

For some reason, the steering wheel is a little bit stiff..  There isn't a lot of movement allowed with the steering wheel because of this.  However, you still get very good turning, but it's just a little bit flawed due to the steering wheel.  I wouldn't recommend making incredibly fast moves through traffic with this vehicle, because the steering wheel could be a huge hinderence, especially if you have to make split second decisions.. the steering wheel could get stuck on you before you can get all the way into the next lane safely.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>

This car gets some amazing gas mileage.  While not quite as good as the 37 miles that I get with my Celica, it still gets around 32 or so.  Which is definitely economical in comparison to say an Explorer, which gets around 12.  

<b>Pricing</b>

Pricing for this vehicle is extremely low.  Besides a Kia, you can't really find anything that is cheaper than a Neon.  They are built extremely well and they do everything the more expensive cars such as the Taurus do, they are a just a little smaller, and a lot cheaper.  For the money, this is probably the most underpriced vehicle on the market.  This is mostly due to it being the lower end vehicle for Dodge, bring down the price in order to establish themselves in the low end vehicle market.

<b>Style</b>

The Neon isn't exactly the most stylish of vehicles, the interior is quite ugly in fact.  The seats are generally covered with some of the ugliest seat covers, which are usually multicolored and striped or have splashes across them.  My girlfriend owns a Neon herself and she immediately covered up the ugliness of the seats with her own seat covers...  Now they are fine!  I would definitely recommend doing the same if you happen to own one or purchase one... very hideous..

As for outside styling, there's nothing that really sticks out, EXCEPT that the car looks like it is smiling at you.  Thanks to the design of the grill and the placement of the headlights, the car is a veritable joke with it's stylish grin.  

<b>Space</b>

There's more room is this car than there is in a Ramada.  You have seemingly limitless trunk space, which is great if you want to install subwoofers... :)  It is also nice if you do a lot of traveling.  The back seats have a lot of room as well, and could carry quite a few people and in fact, my girlfriend's vehicle has carried a whole lot of people all at once...  I think she carries about 7 people quite frequently to school and back.

<b>Overall</b>

Overall, I highly recommend this vehicle..  It gets amazing gas mileage and it's extremely cheap..  The money that you'll save on gas mileage alone will cover a nice chunk of your car payment each month, especially if you drive the 80-150 miles per day that I drive.

If you are going to buy this car, however, I would recommend that you change the seat covers otherwise you are going to look quite stupid driving around with the ugliest splash seat covers.
