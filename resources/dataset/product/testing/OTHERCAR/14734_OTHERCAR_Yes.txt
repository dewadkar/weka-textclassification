            This is the year we decided to put our tax refund aside and put our previously squandered disposable income into a hefty downpayment on a reasonably new vehicle.

Since we gave up our old Chevy van not long ago, this gave us but one vehicle, my little buzzy car (a previous Epinion).  This was not such a bad situation, since I work at home, and if I need to go anywhere, I could certainly take my fiance to work--unless of course he would be getting in at, say, 3:00 a.m., in which case priorities would be re-arranged.  I prefer to be in bed, or at least at home at that hour.

The problem with our vehicular situation is there are only 2 seats in the CRX.  This is great for just the two of us, but family outings are out of the question.  But being the tightwad I insist on, I wanted to wait to have a nice chunk of change to put down on a car, rather than make giant payments.  In the meantime, I've been doing some research on different makes and models to find exactly the car we want.

What happened was this:  The sister of one of my fiance's co-workers recently bought a new car and needed to sell her old one--you guessed it, a Honda CRX.  This is the <b>Si</b> version, a '91.  Checking with the online Kelley Blue Book, we found that her asking price was the equivalent of the trade-in value.  Now <b>we</b> know what a great car this is, so, yeah, the bulk of the savings went for the purchase of this car.

<i>A BIT ABOUT <b>THIS</b> CAR</i>

The Honda CRX Si we purchased is a 5-speed, with the obligatory 4-cylinder engine.  It boasts a sun-roof, and a larger engine capacity than the regular CRX, which makes the mpg somewhat lower than our other CRX--about 35-39 mgp, as compared to 43-45 mgp on the older car, but still a substantial savings rate in this time of high gas prices.

The clutch in the '91 almost feels useless--there is very little &quot;feel&quot; as to when it's grabbing, so it takes a little getting used to after the tight feel of the clutch on the '89.

Steering and cornering are still super--this is a tiny car, still.  We do feel some pull when hitting the grooves on the highway, but first of all, we drive on Pennsylvania roads (notoriously bad) and we haven't yet replaced the standard tires on this one with our usual premium pick of tires.

I'm a little uncomfortable with the gear ratio:  About 2 seconds into first, and it's time to get it into second.  The clutch grabs high as it is, so I can see this is going to take some getting used to before winter and icy roads.

The interior is somewhat larger than the standard CRX.  There is substantially more leg room, and the inside is wider.  For some body-design reason, it is harder to see out of the back window, though.  The seats are also a bit more comfortable, and they were pretty comfortable to begin with.

Since doing my research, I've found that Honda's overall have quite a high trade-in/resale value.  Our plan now is to wait til the end of summer (unless tips are good, or we win the lottery) and use our older CRX as a trade-in plus cash for a more family-oriented car.  This will give us an economical second car in the meantime for summer jaunts with my daughter.  We'll still be keeping the newer CRX, because we know what a great little car it is.

Really, this vehicle purchase was not in my game-plan, but we've had a great experience with our first one, and we know this Honda is more of a long-term vehicle than others.  I'm okay with the purchase, really I am, I swear it...and there would have been serious &quot;Trouble in River City&quot; if he had bought the Jag he was looking at! But a back seat would be nice.
