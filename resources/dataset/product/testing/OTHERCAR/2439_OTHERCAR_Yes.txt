            When my 2000 Chevy Impala was in the shop once again for an air conditioning/heating problem (thank GOD that is under warranty!), I was forced into leasing a <b>2001 Isuzu Rodeo</b> for the day in order to drive my children to numerous destinations throughout the day to several different cities for their activities.

After picking up the <b>2001 Isuzu Rodeo</b> from the rental agency, I started to put the vehicle through many different conditions and paces.

During the first part of the day, I had to go through extremely heavy rush hour traffic.  I was very surprised about how easy the Rodeo handled.  Even though I was rather unsure how the vehicle would respond, especially since I have driven a passenger car exclusively now for many years, I felt rather sure and secure in this vehicle even in stop and go traffic.

A few hours later, I was on a long highway where I was able to easily maneuver the Rodeo at a cruising speed of 55 MPH.  The engine performed flawlessly and there were no rattles whatsoever.

Later on that afternoon, I was again driving through an extremely bad traffic jam with one of the worst conditions I had ever seen.  I suppose everyone wanted to get home in a hurry because of weather conditions and the fact that it was a long weekend!  Even though I did not slam on the brakes, I was horrified when the pedal came off of the metal base in the Isuzu causing me to panic slightly.  However, I was able to maintain control and didn�t have any other problems with it during that time.

Probably if my oldest son wasn�t such a big defensive lineman, the Isuzu Rodeo would be a good choice of a permanent vehicle for our family.  Even though he was able to sit in the front seat, my son has a long �body� and his head hit the top of the vehicle. However, when I had my youngest son only in the Rodeo, it really was a lot more fun to drive.  He wasn�t as constricted and enjoyed the fun of Mom driving a new �car�.  (I had to explain to him later that our other car was coming back!)

Other than my oldest son being uncomfortable, I actually enjoyed the sitting in the driver�s seat and the back support that it provided. It was very easy to lean from the driver�s side to the back seat of the passenger side to retrieve an item that had fallen off of the seat, and overall I have to say that the comfort and quietness were really rather excellent for what I considered an SUV.

In addition, I liked the way the dashboard was designed.  I was able to view all of the dials and reach the controls for the heating and air conditioning without problems and the heating system proved extremely effective against the extreme cold that we were having that day.

Concerning fuel economy, I received probably about 15 MPG which I feel was rather good considering that I was sitting in a traffic jam for a good bit of the time.  

The things that I did not like about the Isuzu Rodeo were really very few.  

First, I didn�t like the fact that even when the vehicle had only 2000 miles on it that something as basic as the brake pedal would come off that easily.  

In addition, I really did not like the design of their AM/FM/Cassette Radio.  To me, it was too confusing to try to figure out the settings of the buttons, and the search capability of the radio would only go forward instead of forward and backwards as it does in my current vehicle.

Other than that, I really feel that the <b>2001 Isuzu Rodeo</b> is a really great SUV, fun to drive, very easy to handle and maneuver and I give it a very high recommendation.
