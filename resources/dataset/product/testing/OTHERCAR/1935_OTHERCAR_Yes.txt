            ***December 17, 1999---After several months of new car shopping, looking at various other cars, I found there to be no comparison when I chose the 2000 Maxima SE I now own.  I needed a four door vehicle with your basic amenities i.e. power doors, windows, mirrors, moon-roof and seats, a remote central locking system with alarm,  it had to have a strong yet proven and powerful V-6 engine, stop on a dime anti-lock brakes, a quiet yet powerful a/c, an in-dash c/d, a spacious trunk with useful 60/40 split seats and a roomy interior for 4 to 5 adults able to accommodate 6'3 240 pound little old me in comfort.  And I found all of this and more in my Y2K Maxima!  After looking at Accord (for which I traded in my '88 model--but couldn't see paying nearly 3-5 grand more for, not to mention sky high insurance rates), Passat (not as comfortable, poor sales staff attention and definitely not as powerful), A4 (same as Passat--basically), 323i(very nice and quite a status symbol here in L.A., but what sticker shock--10 grand more??? Who are they kidding? And service costs through the roof??? Forget it).  No way was I going to settle for any less than what I got.  I love my SE Maxima (in black of course--wouldn't look better in any other color) with it's 17&quot; wheel option (made available here in early August), for which I made mine nearly 4 months ago.  The power is awesome, the look--legendary, ease of use--the best, handling ability--unlike any other and all of this with Nissans much reliable, proven and perfectly enhanced V-6 engine (now, chain driven not belt driven, extra horse power inducing muffler, 100K miles without a tune-up) you can't go wrong with this car.  I thought I would never leave Honda after 11 years of ownership, but alas, I did.  And you will too. <br><br>
