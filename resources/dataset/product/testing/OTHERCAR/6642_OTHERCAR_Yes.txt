            I just recently talked my spouse into getting a new car- We shopped around at Saturn, the Camry and we finally couldn't help but go back to the VW Jetta.

They were fresh out of 2000 models, which I was hoping to obtain at a discount, being the end of the model year and all. I shopped all the features, and decided what I wanted to drive... But alas, all they had in an automatic ( blasphemy I know, but I hate stick shift) was a 1.8 Turbo. I really didn't want to drive it, but I humored the poor sales guy, standing in front of this poker hot car, on a day that was about 102 degrees.

I was glad I drove it. It was fast, up hills, down hills, with the air on, with 3 people in the car. I am used to my cute little Saturn (which I still like, but no longer love) and swift acceleration with a car-full of bodies, uphill with the air on is kind of a no-no. The Jetta zipped, it turned, it swerved with a precision I was no used to. As we got back from the test drive, the salesguy was explaining all the really mind-shattering array of features. I was tuining out, reminiscing about my test drive, and thinking how I would talk my Saturn-loving spouse into letting me get this car. I have been discovering new features every day practically. 

There are lights in the most clever of locations- on the air vents, the back window buttons- everywhere you can't see on a dark night driving down the road. There is a huge trunk area- I recall the sales guy saying it could fit 2 whole bodies in the trunk ( he didn't say if they were dead or alive, and I didn't ask how he knew;) and that it was the greatest visual illusion man-kind has ever created in a car. The area looks small from the outside, but you can pile quite a few bags of dog chow in the trunk, and have room for the people food too!

I know this car is reliable, it was rated well by many review websites. It ranked as being safe. It has side airbags, and that was another reason I initially looked at it vs. the Saturn. It feels very glued to the road, and handles great in the rain. ( or actually I should say torrential flood flow, which is what Phoenix has been experiencing)

Overall, this car goes- it goes fast, and it goes well. I didn't expect as much as I got for the price I paid. Well worth the sticker price, or should I say price of admission, because it feels like an amusement park ride sometimes... and the gas mileage isn't too shabby either! Now if I could just stop speeding.....

By request I add the following:)
After a year of owning the Jetta, I do have a few updates to offer. The interior is lovely- I selected the grey non-leather interior, because in Arizona shorts and leather are a no no. The wear has been minimal in this time. The seats, inspite of my messy friends, have remained clean and in great shape. I find the drivers seat very comfortable on long trips. I can move my seat to accomodate me perfectly. The passenger in front also seldom complains- with one small exception- never leave your arm resting on the door before it locks- because when you do, your skin gets pinched by the auto- locking action. OUCH! It was all purple and blue for a week.
Now the back seat, is a whole other story. Like I tell my friends- don't go there. The back seat is a knee cruncher even for my shorter friends. This car was not really made for 4 to ride comfortably. You can do it, but only if you have a smiling and forgiving friend. 

As far as cargo space goes- the back seat is fine. If for some reason you did fill the trunk, and did not want to fold it down, there is plenty of room for groceries and the family dog ( not at the same time though- my dog would chow down.)
I still love my car, even a year later!
