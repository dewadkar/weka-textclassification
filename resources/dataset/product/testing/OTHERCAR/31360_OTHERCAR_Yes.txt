              After coming from a 93 Mitsubishi Mirage the 140 hp and 125 torque was plenty for me.  I tried not to take the car over 4500 rpm for the first few hundred miles, however it was hard considering the car feels like it needs to be driven.  I did notice a lack of low end torque, yet after about 4000 rpm, I could feel the power being produced, and I was quite surprised of how well the engine sounded at the higher rpms stock.  The interior design is amazingly well put together, everything is easy to reach and everything flows.  Looks is a big part in cars for me too, and the Celica to me has one of the best body shapes out in the market today.  
  Even though the visibility in the back is below average, there are no problems with it after a week or two of getting used to.  
  The back seats also are extremely small, however the Celica is a "sports" car and should be treated like one, no one in the back.  So far into 11,000 miles in 5 months, there have been no problems, the seats have an extremely nice feel to them, and the handling is excellent.  This car may not be a drag car but get it on a real race track and you will be able to see what it can do.
