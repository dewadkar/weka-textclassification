            <b>Don�t get me wrong</b>�I still have it.  But I don�t get to drive it much anymore.  It went to my husband when I inherited my current boat�er�car, which was deemed more appropriate for hauling the kids.  I miss my Camry!

<b>We bought the car</b> in 1999 with 34,000 miles on it.  After reading numerous consumer report articles and on-line advice, we decided that a Camry was the best choice for our needs.  We had two small children and were somewhat cash poor, but wanted something reliable and suitable for a family of four.  I then researched the internet to find available 1996-1997 Camrys with low mileage, and finally decided to check a local Toyota dealer which had several listed.  We looked at two and settled on our gray-blue beauty.  We paid $13,500.00, slightly below the price I estimated from Blue Book information.  We have now owned the car for two and a half years and it currently has about 74,000 miles under its wheels.

<b>This model</b> (the LE) is a fairly stripped-down one, but it has all of the essentials�air conditioning, am/fm stereo cassette (which worked great until my baby melted a crayon in the cassette slot.  We have since replaced it with a CD player), automatic windows and doors and a remote theft deterrent feature (which I have heard does not really deter thieves, and this happens to be the most frequently stolen car in our area!).  We opted for the model without a sunroof, although one of our options at the same price had one.  We had heard some horror stories, and decided to avoid any chance of a problem.

<b>The exterior</b> of the 1996 Camry has a nice, streamlined appearance.  While some dub it somewhat dull, I actually like the look.  But then, our other car at the time was a Plymouth Acclaim, so please take my frame of reference into consideration!  Toyota performed a major overhaul of the Camry sometime around 1994, so the 1996 still looks like most of the Camrys now on the road.  Even the latest �total overhaul� on the newest models was not as extreme as the last one.  I will add that each time I see one of those older models (pre-1994) on the road--and it is often--I feel gratified by the decision to purchase a Camry.  

<b>The interior</b> of the car is intelligently designed.  There is plenty of front seat legroom.  The upholstery is typical lower-grade plush, but it washes easily and seems to be quite sturdy.  The seats themselves are comfortable enough, and the controls allow enough maneuvering of the front seats to establish one's best driving posture.  It has a double cup holder which comes in handy, but if you smoke or otherwise hope to use the ashtray, you have to forego the cup holder.  The instrument panel is clear and easy to read at a glance.  I do have a complaint about the windshield wiper controls.  There is only one intermittent setting, so you have to choose fast or slow, there is no in between.  To further add to the frustration of bad weather, the Camry is so tightly constructed (sounds like a good thing, doesn�t it?) that foggy windows are a constant problem.  The defrosters do work well, but they need to be set on a fairly cool setting.  In chilly, rainy weather one has to choose between seeing the road or freezing one�s tail off.  Your call.  We tend to alternate between the two. :-) 

<b>The back seating</b> is adequate.  We thought the Camry was about the same size as our Acclaim.  Not quite so.  As typical of foreign vs. American cars, the Camry is slightly smaller.  We know because our kids couldn�t reach the front seats with their feet in the Acclaim.  This is sadly not true in the Camry.  The back seat does hold three children comfortably (although the center seat is a lap restraint only).  We have even managed two children and one adult fairly easily.  Three adults would definitely be a stretch, but it could be done if necessary (and if they were all on the slender side).  Remember, legroom is an issue, so taller adults should sit up front.  

<b>I am quite pleased</b> with the gas mileage of this car.  Even when my husband drove it 50 miles every day in city traffic, it seemed to get over 20 MPG.  Again, for comparison, I now drive the aforementioned boat.  It has a 20-gallon tank that I have to fill every four days.  The Camry has a 15-gallon tank and it lasts a full week (and we both work at the same place).  The maintenance has been equally pleasant.  Aside from oil changes and a set of new tires, the only real maintenance this car has required is new brakes.  We attribute this to the abuse the brakes took during two years of city traffic.    

<b>The Camry LE</b> comes standard with a four-cylinder engine.  I am by no means an expert on the particulars of engine behavior.  However, compared to the Acclaim, also a four-cylinder, and the boat (a Plymouth Park Avenue, if you were wondering), which happens to be a six-cylinder, the Camry wins hands-down for pickup and general perkiness.  My husband says so, too, guys, so it can�t be just me!  It also idles quite smoothly (is the car still running, hon?).  I will be the first to admit that I am no expert at mechanics and the technicalities of automobile structure and maintenance.  However, I <i>do</i> do the necessary research before buying a vehicle (don�t let the other two cars I mentioned deter you; they were both obtained through happenstance, not research) and I believe that the comparisons I am able to make to other vehicles I have driven regularly can be useful to someone considering buying a previously owned vehicle.  

<b>I do miss driving our Camry</b> regularly, but when I get the chance to go out on my own, I always take that car.  Both economically and emotionally, it is the best choice.  I had hopes that once the Park Avenue goes, I could take the Camry back (we plan to keep it for 10 years or so).  But my husband seems to think that I�ll need to get another larger vehicle for transporting a growing family.  Seems he is rather fond of the Camry himself.  We�ll talk about it further when the time comes!
