            I am a mechanic and a Dad and this is one vehicle every parent needs for the protection of their family.  This van is one the most reliable and safest mini-vans on the market.  The space inside is great and the comfort is unbeatable.  With the seven passenger seating installed there is still plenty of storage room unlike the SUV's.  The safety features of this vehicle are the most appealing for any parent.  Dodge/Plymouth have earned a great reputation for building the safest cars in their class and I have seen several of these vehicles after accidents.  They are quite expensive to have repaired after an accident because they look demolished.  This is the way they are built.  The vehicle has multiple crumple zones to absorb the impact in a crash.  You may pay a little more repairing the vehicle after a crash but you won't be attending a funeral. <br><br>
