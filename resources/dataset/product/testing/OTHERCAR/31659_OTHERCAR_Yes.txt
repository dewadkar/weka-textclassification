            i have owned this car for about a month. At first I thought it wouldn't fit my personality, but after a couple trips it was up to par. It has great seats and leg space(since I'm tall 6'1). this car can look sporty and luxurious at the same time. On the speed, I have own a couple of cars that went fast, but never a 3.8 V6. It can be great on long highway trips( restrict using the A/C) but costly around the neighborhood trips. What you expect its an American car! Well I love it and might think twice about turning it back in, unless I get a better deal on a car that doesn't need so much gas to make it run. But overall get car with great looks  & comfort!

If you into rims* you can buy some BBS or Mercedes(AMG) rims to make the statement.
If you want power, A mustang air filter conversion, and cat back flow masters will give you the little power and sound of excellence!
If you want sound, pioneer Cd player and speakers for interior give great sound, and in the trunk just load two 12" punch box with a 1000 watt amp with cross over and you got bass!
