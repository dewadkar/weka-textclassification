            The 2000 Oldsmobile Alero GLS is by far one the best cars I've driven in a long time. I put over 3,000 miles on a silver GLS 4 door last summer and I was impressed, very impressed. I drove this car from St.Petersburg ,FL through GA, TN, NC, and to KY and it drove and rode excellent, even through the mountains. The only thing that I could find wrong about this car is on the 2 door there is a bad blind spot on the drivers side, that's it. The Alero has 3 trim levels, GX, GL, and GLS, the GLS has the 3.4 V6 which is an excellent engine, the only downfall is you can't get the 5 speed manual with the V6, only with the 2.4 4 cylinder (which is an achievement just to get Olds to get a 5 spd.). The GLS also has leather power seats, cd player and cassette, 16&quot; polished aluminum wheels, fog lamps. The 4 cylinder version is a little cheaper but it dosen't compare to the GLS, it's like GM designed a whole other car. This is a very balanced car on the road, feels like your driving a BMW, you can feel the road. If anybody is looking for a car that costs less than anything Honda or Toyota has you don't have look very far. The Accord LX V6 and the Toyota Camry LE V6 costs about $1,500 to $2,000 more than the GLS Alero.        <br><br>
