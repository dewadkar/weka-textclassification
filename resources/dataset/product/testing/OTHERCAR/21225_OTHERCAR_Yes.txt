            The Toyota Camry is a great automobile.  We have purchased many cars over the years, domestic and foreign but feel the Camry is a great buy.  The current car we have is a LE V6.  Having driven many 4 cylinder Camrys, this one really has a lot of acceleration especially while changing lanes or merging into traffic.  194 horsepower is plenty!  The interior of the Camry reflects careful thought and planning.  The car feels very solid and built like a tank.  The doors feel slightly heavy but it is a feeling of quality construction and not cheap materials.  The ride of the automobile is very smooth and seems to absorbs bumps pretty well.  Gas mileage is very good, for the six cylinder, city:22 mpg, highway:28 mpg.  Styling is rather conservative, but the new chrome around the grille and larger tail lights do certainly enhance the automobile. The trunk is very roomy and can store quite a lot.  Rear seat comfort is adequate, maybe slightly cramped with tall adults. 

I love this vehicle for its wonderful ride, quietness, and DEPENDABILITY!!

One should consider this vehicle if he/she likes something not too flashy, comfortable ride, and incredible dependabilty.

If you like a lot of flash, then the Camry's conservative styling maybe too bland for you. <br><br>
