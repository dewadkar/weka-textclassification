            The Agfa ePhoto 780c digital camera was on sale at a local shop. I have for quite some time wanted to get a camera for two of my kids, and with all the money saved on film plus film development I thought a digital camera would be suitable. The quality of the pictures therefore wasn�t the prime consideration.

I did some research via the internet and found that the 780c is a �new� release of the 780, so any of the reviews about the 780 would really apply. The only change with the 780c seems to be that the case is a different colour and apparently the CCD (the element actually taking the picture) is supposedly slightly better than in the original 780. So in other words, the technology is slightly dated but that means it has really come down in price.

On the first day the kids had the camera, they each took more than a 100 pictures, if they keep at it at this speed it will definitely save money having bought a digital camera instead of the �old-fashioned� kind. I have used other more expensive digital cameras so I feel I am able to do some comparison: The colour of the pictures is sometimes a bit blue-tinted, but this can fairly easily be changed with the �quick-fix� options available with most graphics programs such as PhotoDeluxe by Adobe. It is very easy to switch between the different levels of picture �quality�. Personally I would always want to shoot pictures at maximum quality, if you do that, the memory car in the camera will only save about 12 pictures. The kids seem happy at shooting at the lowest quality where the camera will store about 96 pictures. Be aware that Agfa claims you can make pictures that are 1024x768 pixels in size. This is not strictly true. The accompanying program can �interpolate� pixels so that the picture becomes bigger, but it won�t have been shot at a true 1024x768. Agfa is not the only company making digital cameras that makes this kind of claim.

Overall it is an easy to use camera, and the quality is great at the price.
