            Hi, my name is Lisa K. and I drive a Chevrolet Lumina Mini-Van.  This is
not a vehicle that I could see myself driving when I purchased it.  I bought it because my kids...soon to be teenagers at the time...wanted more
room than the vehicle that I wanted..which was a truck....could provide.
I have owned and driven this van for almost four years, and have not one
time regretted my decision to buy it.  In fact, have congratulated my
kids for a wonderful choice.  One of the best things about this van is
the seats are so easy to get in and out.  We have the seats in and out
of it more times than you can imagine.  This van has never left me
stranded either.  I have the oil changed and all the levels checked when
I'm supposed to, and it has never failed to start.  I consider this vehicle one of the best investments that I have made.  I never thought I
would like driving a mini-van, I'd always driven cars before, and the Lumina has such a wide windshield.  But, now, after driving one, would not
go back to driving a car.   I like sitting up a little higher off the road, and the windshield allows for better vision.  There are far fewer
blind spots when changing lanes.  I have had this van loaded down with
kids or tools or ladders...you name it...it's seen it.  My husband and I
went out one night in it, and for some reason or another the seats were out of the back of it, and we pretended we were teenagers again!  It is surely an all purpose vehicle!  Thank you very much for listening to my opinion.  I hope this helps you with your decision on what purchase would best fit your lifestyle.<br><br>
