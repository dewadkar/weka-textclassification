            I have had this camera about 1 month. It replaces my Kodak DC270 - a 1.3 megapixel camera. This camera is expensive but you get what you pay for (for the most part).

<B>CRYSTAL CLEAR:</B> The photos from this camera are beautiful. The colors are vivid and the images are clear.

<B>FLEXIBLE SETTINGS:</B> Much like a real camera, you can set a myriad of options for your shots. This is great for experimentation and getting the best shot. You can set f-stop, aperture, focus and more. Unfortunately, the controls are a little complex so it takes some practice. I find myself referring to the manual periodically.

<B>NIFTY DISPLAY:</B>One of the unique features is its fold out display. You can leave it flat against the back like most cameras or you can swing it out. It can face forward or back, tilted up or down. This allows you to use the camera in all sorts of positions. If you don't need the display, you can flip face in against the back of the camera - protecting from your greasy nose and cheek! By the way, the display is also crystal clear.

<B>HURRY UP AND ZOOM!</B> Unfortunately, the zoom feature is slow to respond. You hit the button and there's a short pause before it starts moving the lens. It's a little annoying.

<B>FEEDBACK:</B> The camera provides a wealth of information during and after each picture. The rear display shows all settings in effect. The top display maintains the basic info such as mode, battery level, and shots left. Again, sometimes a little too much info but... I grab the manual and brush up.

<B>ERGONOMICS:</B> The camera feels like a normal film camera. It's comfortable to hold and designed to fit in your hands well.

<B>COOL MOVIES:</B> One of the coolest features of this camera is its ability to shoot 30 second movies. They are actually decent quality and include sound. It's a fun little extra and impresses your friends!

This is a serious camera and is not for the beginner. The price is a bit high so it's really aimed at amateur and professional photographers. I think it's a great camera - if you end up buying one, you will be satisfied.
