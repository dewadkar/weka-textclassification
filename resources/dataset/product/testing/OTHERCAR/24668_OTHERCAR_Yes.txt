            We bought a 1997 Chevrolet Venture from my Uncle.  We we're driving a prizm, and we needed a bigger vehicle, little did I know that this would come along.

I love this van.  There is only two things that I could say would get better, and one Chevrolet has already updated in the newer versions.  First, the cargo space (or trunk space) could be bigger, but in the 1998 or newer styles they are.  Secondly, this is just annoying, but I guess it is worthy.  The back end makes a noise when there is a lot of weight in it, and this is called shock absorbers, but since this is the newest vehicle we've every owned, I didn't know what it was, and it was nerve racking, but now that I know, I am glad it is there.

The things I like about this vehicle are that it is a 7 passenger van.  It has cup holders for everyone, it has cargo space where you wouldn't even guess it to be.  It is good on gas, and it is very stylish.  It handles great on ice and snow, which in Minnesota we need.  I also like the ability to get into the back second seat through the driver door.  You can do this by folding up the front seat, like you would in a 2-door, so it is easier to get into.

I will keep this van for a long time to come.  I have had no mechanical problems with it, and it handles great on the road.  It is also very quite, other than the shock absorber, but if you do not have 400 lbs of stuff in the back you should not hear it.

I also like the air compressor in the back, where if I get a flat, or someone else has a flat, I can pump them up.  Its good for balls and inner tubes as well.  Also, the seats come out quick easily to be able to haul things around.<br><br>
