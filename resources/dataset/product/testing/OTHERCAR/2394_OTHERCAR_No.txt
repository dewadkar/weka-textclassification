            I bought the PDR-M5 when it came out in October. I fell for the specs, with 2,1 Megapixel resolution and 3 x zoom, and I read a very positive review about it in the Steve's Digicams web site.

But my overall impression of the cmera is not positive. The picture quality is my main concern, it OK, but if you compare it to  Nikon Coolpix 950, the pictures from the Nikon is very much sharper, and it also has nicer, more saturated colors.

ALso there are some ergonomical features of the Toshiba that I don't like. The flimsy lens cap does not stay on the lens, it very easily falls off, and the lens is very unprotected withut it. The camera is very light, but bulky, and it does not have a good balance.

But the biggest problem is that the dial that you use to turn it on is located at the top of the camera, where it very easily gets turned by accident. So, for example if the camera is lying in a camera bag, it sets itself on by the movement of the bag, so when you pick it up the battery is dead since it does not have any automatic powersaving mode. This is a very serious problem, it has ruined many photo opportunities for me. A very simple solution would be if Toshiba just put a little lock on the dial.
The software is good, and the USB interface is fast.<br><br>
