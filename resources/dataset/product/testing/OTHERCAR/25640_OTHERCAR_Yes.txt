            The '99 Saab 9-5 2.3 wagon is our fourth Saab and we love it.  We wanted a vehicle that would hold more cargo than our incredibly versatile Saab 9-3 sedan and we weren't interested in the popular gas guzzling, air polluting, cumbersome, truck based sport utilities.  Given our passion for Saabs, the 9-5 wagon was a logical choice.  Our wagon is equipped with the 2.3 liter turbo charged 4 cylinder engine and automatic transmission and the car has proven to be both quick and economical--we have achieved 30 mpg on the highway with 4 passengers and their gear.  The 9-5 chassis is very rigged, thus the car handles very well, the cabin is rattle free and very quiet--not typical wagon attributes.  The styling of the 9-5 wagon is quite attractive and we have received many comments from passing admirers who agree.  The Saab 9-5 line has done well in crash tests and reliability studies and I highly recommend the entire 9-5 line to anyone considering an entry level luxury, sport wagon or sedan. <br><br>
