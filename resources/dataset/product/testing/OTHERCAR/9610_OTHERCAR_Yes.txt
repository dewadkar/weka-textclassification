            I had previously owned a 1995 Toyota Celica.  I had my 95 model for 2 years and was very fond of it, and intended on keeping it until they changed the model's look.  Well in September of 1999 my roommate brought home an Automobile magazine which featured the new Celica.  It came out on October 1st and on the 6th of October I drove it off the lot.  In fact it was only the 2nd one the dealership had sold.  I got a Silver GT model with spoiler, manual shift, moonroof and the works !!!

I will never forget how many stares I got the first few weeks I had the car.  It was a wonderful feeling.

I have now had the car for almost 2 years now, have put 24,000 miles on it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I have been thinking of trading it in on a GT-S model with leather seats.  Leather Seats were the one thing I regretted not getting originally!! (Sigh)   But anyways, I haven't had any problems with the car, and have maintained it to the letter.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!   Now the question is....when I trade it in...should I go for a black one or a silver one (like I have now)??? Decisions Decisions!! :)
