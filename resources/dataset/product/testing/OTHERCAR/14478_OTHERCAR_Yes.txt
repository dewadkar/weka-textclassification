            After driving Jeep Cherokee's for over two years I realized it was time to make a change. I have damaged my back and the poor suspension combined with the small seats made it a very uncomfortable vehicle. I started looking at Land Rover on the recommendation of a friend. I have since bought her more than one beer in thanks.

One of my first concerns was off-road capability. I love to take trips into the mountains of East Tennessee and have to have a car that won't leave me stranded in the dirt. One ride over the example course at my local dealership showed me that the Discovery was the tool for the job. I was completely amazed by how well the traction control system handled slippery surfaces and the sheer amount of torque delivered from the engine. Combine that with suspension that moves like a spider's legs over rocks and obstacles and you have the perfect off-road vehicle.

Of course the whole reason for changing was comfort. In the Discovery I found wide soft seats that will adjust to almost any position. On the pavement the suspension felt like a luxury car. I was able to feel the road, but was not jarred by pot-holes or even speed bumps. I don't know how they made the suspension handle so well on the road and still move like that off-road but Land Rover engineers have my highest respect.

Many people look simply at the hight of the vehicle and assume that it will tip over easily. I used to think that too, but after the road course I know that a Discovery can tilt 45 degrees without tipping over. Try that in any other SUV and you will be picking glass out of your face. A heavy frame combined with an aluminum (never rusts!) body puts a Land Rover's center of gravity really low.

Many people also point to the fact that it only has 188 horsepower. They are neglecting the 250 pounds of torque this engine produces. If you want to drive a vehicle off-road you must have ample amounts of torque. If you intend to pull anything then you'll need torque. The Discovery pulls 7700 pounds, 2700 more than anything else in its class. If you just want to drive your kids to soccer practice you should probably buy a mini-van.

I really didn't think that any vehicle could be comfortable on the road and still have real off-road capabilities. Land Rover proved me wrong.
