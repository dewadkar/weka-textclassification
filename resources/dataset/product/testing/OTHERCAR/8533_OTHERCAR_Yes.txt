            I had been a minivan mom for a while and when decided that as a single woman, I need to spruce up my image.  At the same time, I needed a vehicle that reliable.  My family has been a Chrysler family for longer than I can remember.  My dad has done business with the same dealership for the past 30 years!  I fell in love with my Sebring LXI from the moment I saw it!  It handles unbelievable well. I know it sounds crazy, but when I am driving with the windows down, the sunroof open and the radio blasting, I feel sexy!  I have had it for almost two years and still love it.  I get great gas mileage, have had practically no maintenence.  The only real problem I have had is with the door side panels.  The &quot;rivets&quot; used to hold them on were constructed properly and they would come loose.  Chrysler has since fixed that problem and recalled all the cars that experienced difficulty and fixed it.  It is my understanding from my dealer that none of the newer cars will have this problem. I think this is a great car for a single person or a two person family. It has a HUGE trunk! Although it has a back seat, there is not alot of room for an adult to be very comfortable. Would I buy it again? Absolutely!<br><br>
