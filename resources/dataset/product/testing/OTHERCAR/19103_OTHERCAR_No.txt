            Back in 1997 i leased a Kia Sportage because i liked how it looked and it was affordable...BAD IDEA!!!...in 3 years now i have been to my service department over 40 times....I will tell you some of my problems! For Example at 4000 miles the clutch on my manual tranny was slipping so i took it in and they said it was just an adjustment needed..IT TOOK 2 WEEKS TO COMPLETE THE ADJUSTMENTS!!! and when i finnnaly did get it back it was still slipping..so i took it to a different dealer and they said adjustments so i told them to go to **** and left with my &quot;car&quot; again at 8000 miles my problemm got worse so that i could barely get the car to move! So i had it towed to my dealership and the &quot;Adjusted&quot; the cluth and the problem went away until 14000 miles when it started slipping again as bad as before! so they once again did &quot;adjustments&quot; and now at 49000 miles jusyt after my warranty ran out i had to pay $1200!!! for a new clutch why didnt they replace it while i was under warranty!!!!!! And now onto the engine..this is fun...The day after i bought the car i was back at the shop for a check engine light...They said it was and EGR or PCV valve or somethign like that i dont remember ive had so many problems...and replaced it for free...i have had this VERY SAME PROBLEM 12 times since then!!!!!! And now at 56000 miles it it for no reason idling at 4000rpm...And yesterday coming home it was stuck at 7500RPM!!! nothign would stop it short of turning the car off!!The Very second i start it up the engine howls up to 7500 rpm and wopnt go down ive check all of my throttle linkages and they are all clear i seriously think the engine managment computer is shot and the dealer wouldnt admit it cause they didnt want to do the work!!!! so now i have NO CAR that works and im risking getting fired!! well i guess ive told you all of my problems now!! Feel Free to email me if you have had simlar experiences!!!<br><br>
