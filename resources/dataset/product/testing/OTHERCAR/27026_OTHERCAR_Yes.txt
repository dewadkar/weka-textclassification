            This digital camera is definately worth investing in. This is my first venture into digital and I also am a beginner when it comes to photography. This camera is on national back order and it is HOT!! I visited countless web-sites and visited several camera shops before I came across this beauty at a Circuit City Express. By reading opinions of other members, I was able to make this smart purchase. This camera is a fairly light weight, easy to hold camera. It's buttons are complicated at first and the instruction manual is a test of your patience.  But, just like riding a bike, you get used to it quickly.  I was able to find it for around $500, which seems to be the going price.  Shop around though 'cause some places were lower than others.
I strongly recommend getting a card reader for your &quot;smart media&quot; card.  It makes downloads a breeze.  Just make sure the reader is compatible with your PC.  I also purchased 8 AA Nickel-MH rechargeable batteries and a charger from Radio Shack (all totaled about $50).  This way I am never without batteries.  Of course, you can always run on AA alkaline too, but the LCD drains them quickly.  I also purchased additional digital film (16MB).  Olympus provides and 8MB card which will hold about 36 pictures depending on the setting quality you have it on.  If you wish to purchase additional film, figure on about $30-$100, depending on the size of the film.
  If you are looking for a great beginner camera with alot of features for the money try the D-450Zoom.<br><br>
