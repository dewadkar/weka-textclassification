            My daughter needed a car for her commute to college. After a bout with a used car that broke down after 1 week my wife and I decided that it would save us allot of aggravation and money if we went out purchased her a new car. Just eliminating the reliability and repair costs seemed worth it. Driving from dealer to dealer we looked at all the comparable cars in the same price range. We were looking for a car that wouldn't take such a bite out of our bank account and put her in something safe and respectable. We then stumbled upon the Hyundai Accent.
The GL version (4 Door) came with enough standard equipment that we didn't have to spend and extra two thousand in options. A/C,P/S,Automatic,and dual air bags were all part of the standard package. Not to mention my daughter's absolute critical necessities of a cassette player and a mirror.
The Warrantee is currently the best in the country, 5 Year 60k bumper to bumper, a 10 Year power-train, and 5 year roadside assistance.
The only drawback was that it was a 4 door and kids like 2 door sedans. Although the car is available in a 2 door, by the time you add all the options that came standard with the 4 door model it would have cost us over one thousand dollars more.  We really took a chance by bringing the car home without her looking at it first. Kids (especially the girly ones) have a nice way of letting you know when they are not happy with mom or dads decision. I was afraid I was going to regret it but I was out of time and my patience was running low. Well Lucky me
She loves the car, and it's blue too! my favorite color.
All in all the car drives nice and tight and has reasonable pep for a small engine.
The only problem we have had over the past month is that windshield developed a stress crack after about 2 weeks which was promptly replaced by the dealer. I do disagree with the maintanence program. I have found over the years that 7500 miles is to long between oil changes and prefer to change mine ever 3000-4000 miles.
I have been a GM owner for years and have purchased my last 4 cars new. I would recommend that anyone that is interested in a compact car take a look at the Hyundai Accent. Although I still can't pronounce the name correctly I think this little Korean automobile is a nice car for the money. <br><br>
