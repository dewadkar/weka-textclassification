            We bought our V70 new a few years back.  We had just started our family and wanted a safe car (we were driving a honda civic) with 4 doors and room.  We considered a Tahoe, but it was too much a 'truck' for my wife.  

Pros:
- 2 years and 3 kids later we still love this car.  We bought the V70R model (turbo) and it is powerful, handles great - especially in bad weather and snow.  It still looks brand new.  This is a very sharp looking car - you almost forget its a wagon.  
- It must be cold in Sweden, because the heater on this car works better than any car I have ever owned.  We thought the heated seats were a bit decadent, but once you have them you never go back!

Cons:
- Its expensive.  We bought ours in Canada and drove it down from Vancouver BC to Portland Oregon.  We saved about 5 grand.  The only quirk is that our gas gauge is in liters and the temp gauges are in centigrade.

- We have had wheel bearings go out twice.  Fixed underwarranty.
- It goes through brakes about every 12 months.
- The headlight bulbs burn out often, at $15 each.  The good news is that they are easy to replace yourself.
- Routine maintenance is expensive too.  Granted we only use the dealer, but a LOF is $75 compared to $30 at a quick lub place.
- It doesn't have that much room for a 5 passenger car.  We have 3 car seats in ours and it is a very tight squeeze.  I don't thing you could get 5 standard adults back there.

We need a bigger car/suv, but we can't stand the thought of not having our V70.  I highly recommend this car, even with the con's I have described.

Update:  With 65,000 miles on it, the V70 still looks great. But it is starting to get more and more expensive to keep running.  The dealer says I am 'in the zone' - which means things are breaking about every 6 months to the tune of $1000+ to fix.  Vacuum pumps, belts, etc. etc.  Not fun.  And with the trade in value at $18,000 or less - the cost per year of this car is pretty steep.

Its still fun to drive, and comfortable. Although now that we have 3 kids it is starting to get a little tight.  We are considering the 3rd seat option to stretch it out a few more years.  What we really need is a Suburban :-(
