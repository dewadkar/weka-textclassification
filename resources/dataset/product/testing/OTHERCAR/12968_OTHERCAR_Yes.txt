            I bought the LX 450 new in 1997. So far I haven't had any major problems. I would recommend this SUV to anyone who is thinking about purchasing an SUV because it is VERY reliable and it has some pretty neat features. First of all, the engine it a huge V-6 flat, which is a largest a V-6 can get. I have a 24.5 foot Sea Ray and it tows it with no problem whatsoever. Also it is all time 4 WD so you can go up snowy mopuntians or wet streets. The leather seats make any long ride very comfortable. I also like the optional 6 disc changer which is conveniently located in the back of the center console of the front seat. Also i like the idea of the folding seats at the back of the car. If you have a lot of cargo you can just fold the seats to the side and they dont take much room up at all. Whenever you have a lot of passengers you can easliy fold out the back seats. The front and passenger seats have a 6 way seat adjustment. Heaters for the front seats are optional. Compared to most large-scale SUVs, the LX 450 doesn't eat up a lot of gas. The ride is very, very smooth just like any Lexus. All in all, if you are looking for a SUV, I would consider purchasing this one.<br><br>
