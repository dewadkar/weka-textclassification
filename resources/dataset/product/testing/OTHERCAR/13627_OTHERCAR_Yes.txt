            My dad bought this truck in 1990 when it was brand new, and since then he has only been to the shop 3 time (not counting oil changes and minor tune-ups).  He has added a 3 inch lift kit, 33 inch tires with American Racing wheels, a cap and a bright red paint job. This truck is very dependable and also has great power with a 350 5.7 liter fuel injected engine. It is fully loaded with power everything ,4wd, auto, am/fm cass. and an equalizer.  I would reccomend this truck for anyone who tows anything because it can tow up to 4000 pounds. The only thing wrong with it is it only gets 13 or 14 miles to tha gallon.  This is a great truck for mud hopping or if you like to drive big trucks.<br><br>
