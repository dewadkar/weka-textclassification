            One of the reasons that I bought a 92 Mazda 929 was, when the dealer told me about all the &quot;safety&quot; features, little did i know that when i totaled the car, it would be the airbags that caused all the damage. You read other eopinion members say that their airbags did not deploy, they should count their blessings.

Down to it
Pros: The best looking Mazda ever, great leather seats (though they crazy) and an awesome stock Panasonic stereo equipment. With controls on the steering wheel. Decent gas mileage at 21mpg

Cons: Undependable, horribly expensive parts and labor. Rear shocks (500 bucks) fragile fiber glass body not only dents easier then playdoh but makes you feel like ur swinging at high speeds. When the car was slightly tapped at 5 mph, by a Toyota Corolla it left a permentant imprint of the other cars license plate number (repair 1500 with rental car). Horrible security system that went off when you opened the car door (with the key). The drivers seat feels like a rocking chair after 85k miles) The worst headlights i have ever seen, and i have owned 12+ cars (within the family) my '88 camry illuminates the road better. 

If i was asked, would you like a '92 Mazda 929 or a '89 Nissan Axis (Which were all recalled due to the ignition igniting the whole car in flames) I would say pass me a flame retardant life jacket and pass me the Axis!!!!!!<br><br>
