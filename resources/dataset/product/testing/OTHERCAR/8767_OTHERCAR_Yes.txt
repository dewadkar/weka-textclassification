            In May 2001, my wife and I toured Europe and fell in love with the Mercedes/Swatch Smart Car.  Alas, SUV loving, gas gobbling Americans don't want anything as small and practical as the Smart Car, so one can't be had in the USA.  However, not long after returning from our trip, we saw the Toyota Echo.  After looking them over and test driving one, we bought two of them.  

The vehicle is designed well, handles well, has terrific gas mileage (we get a combined highway and city average right at 40mpg).  The uniquely placed instrument cluster is wonderful at night - no glowing instrument cluster right in front of you.  The visibility is terrific - you sit high and can see well all around.  I just love the way the front of the hood is dropped and is not visible from the cabin - reminds me of my old 1963 Ford Econoline Van.  The cabin is roomy and the fold down rear seats means I can still make runs to the hardware store.  True the engine is small, but I have no trouble going up Monument Hill from Colorado Springs on my way to Denver.  

The car is practical.  That seems to be the real reason behind the comments about it being "ugly" or "not powerful enough".  The real problem is Americans - they are spoiled into thinking they need Expeditions or Excursions - huge SUVs that they drive back and forth to the grocery store.  If you want a well, made, roomy, peppy, practical, wonderful car get a Toyota Echo.  

My only complaint would be that some options were not available; such as cruise control and power windows.  Not a great loss however as the car is a real pleasure to drive without cruise control.  And the sound system is great!
