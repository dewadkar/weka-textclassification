            I was seriously considering an S80.  I really was.  I simply love the car's styling, its size is perfect for a family and long range hauler, the luxury comfort was ideal, and there is the Volvo name and reputation.  Then I took it for a long test drive.

On the plus side, is everything above.  The car is simply beautiful, it has incredible room front and back, and very comfortable seats.  Driver ride position is great, excellent visibility.  Safety features, well, this is a Volvo.  Trunk is HUGE and will easily fit a large set of golf clubs.  Of interest, the battery is tucked into a compartment in the trunk for safety reasons.

Now the cons...

I expected this car to be a responsive luxury sports sedan.  It's not.  I didn't expect a BMW, but the ride is way too soft, feels like a Lincoln rather than a European sedan.  There isn't much feel for the road, and the surprisingly, the car tended to float and drift on the highway - requiring it to be constantly redirected and pointed straight.  A friend who also drove a different S80 noted the same annoying ride quirks.

I was also very surprised at how much road noise entered the cabin.  This is the first year run of this model, so this noise should have been noted and addressed.  It was really bad, not something I expected at this price range at all.  The dealer said it was because the floor mats weren't in, but that wasn't the problem.

The car's engine also seemed underpowered.  The engine wasn't straining, but it also didn't command any attention.  This was also a surprise given the car's size and weight.

And that is real issue - at the price range this car sits in, I expect dang near close to perfection, but this car only ranks above average.  There have also been complaints about unreliable transmissions, headlights that need replacing every few months, and more, so reliability is a concern.  I was told (and research backs this) that these problems have been largely fixed for 2000/2001.

In summary, a nice car, but I expected better.
