            When I was looking to buy my car my first priority was quality followed closely by comfort and performance in some sort of sporty luxury vehicle. I quickly narrowed my choices down to two: the Solara, and the Honda Accord Coupe. After test driving both numerous times there was no doubt about my decision. While both handled well and had power (I drove the six cylinders in both) the Solara far outpaced the Accord in comfort, quietness, and roominess. The seats seemed to be much more molded to my body, I didn't feel like the front windshield was right on top of my head, and after I started the car up I had to check the tachometer to make sure the engine was running because it is so quiet! 

I love my car! I have a 20 mile commute every day to downtown Boston and it is so much nicer now that I am comfortable all the time. I've also greatly enjoyed the added power and handling coming from a four cylinder Saturn to the Solara's smooth and quick drive while threading through highway traffic. There is nothing I hate about this car except that someday it is going to get old and I am going to have to get rid of it. 

This is probably not a family car because of the two doors, but the back seat is as big as any four door I have ever been in. Anyone looking for quality and luxury in a moderate priced sports car should run to their Toyota dealer.<br><br>
