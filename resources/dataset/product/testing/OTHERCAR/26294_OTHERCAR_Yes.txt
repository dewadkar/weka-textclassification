            I  Didn't picture myself buying a civic after seeing so many around town, until I saw the Sporty 2 door Blue Si.I loved it from the moment I saw it. The color is the best- I hope Honda doesn't produce this color in any of the other  styles- so that it can be one of a kind. I love the sporty look of the ground effects.
I am not the typical buyer of this car- I am female and 36.Most I see admiring or looking at the car are in their teens.
I added  nice chrome wheels that give it  a  bit of  extra style ( Honda does include nice wheels on the Si- But The dealer said the stock wheels get stolen frequently. I also added a  normal size( Common) Wing on the back- Honda for some reason only has a high spoiler available for this car- I am too old for this- I  am happy I didn't opt for it.I love the  interior size- for a &quot;one person in the car most of the time driver&quot; there is plenty of space, however the seats are a bit odd at first to get used too- They are a bit high for me
(I am  5'6) My hair touches the roof when I have the seat upright- So you have to get used to having it in a semi reclining position.My husband is always complaining about the low roof- seat position in the car.(5'11)- So neither of us are that tall and my hair is flat so Honda  must be making the seats for all the younger small  people in the world. I Also dont care for  the arm rest- they are too low- my arm cant rest comfortably. The middle storage bin is placed so far back I can't rest my arm on that either. HOWEVER... This car is so fun to drive.Passing another car is actually fun and a breeze.It feels solid &amp;  corners great. I love  shifting even though I wish the shifter was a bit longer ( my arms must be too short) The knobs are easy to reach- and the interior is nicely layed out-  I Love it and plan on keeping it forever!<br><br>
