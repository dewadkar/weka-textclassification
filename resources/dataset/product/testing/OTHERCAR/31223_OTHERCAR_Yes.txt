            The 2002 Jeep Liberty is a versatile vehicle. It is more sporty and at the same time more refined than its Cherokee predecessor. 
The unique exterior front styling looks very sharp. The finely fitted body panels and doors remind me of a Mercedes-Benz. The ride is much quieter than our old '99 Cherokee. Everything has a sound and solid feel. The handling, braking, and suspension are superior to the Cherokee we had. (We really liked the old Cherokee)
One thing I am not real pleased with is the power. The Liberty weighs substantially more than the Cherokee, and while the smaller 3.7L 6 cylinder churns out a little more HP than the old 4.0L, it makes for a slower acceleration. The 16" tires are nice, and the full size spare is on the outside now to allow more space in the back cargo, which is roomier than you might think. One of the biggest differences is the added headroom in the Liberty. There is also considerably more leg room for the rear passengers.
The air conditioning has worked very good in the hot Texas summer, and we have had no mechanical problems. 
The seats are not as comfortable as I would like for a long trip, but they are satisfactory. All controls and instruments are accessable, but I don't like the placement of the box between the front seats being so far back- you can't rest your elbow on it easily. Also, I don't like the electric window controls being located there. The glove box is quite small, but there is a special place for the manual. We are long time manual transmission drivers, so we got the 5 speed manual transmission and I think it makes this vehicle much more fun to drive. 
Overall, we have been pleased with this vehicle. I have not checked the gas mileage, but it seems to be pretty good. It is mainly my wife's car and she likes the look and image of the vehicle.
