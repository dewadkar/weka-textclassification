            I bought a 1998 Porsche new and sold it in 1999.  I can honestly say that I loved every moment driving that car.  I only sold it because I downshifted my life (and my salary) and needed something a bit more practical.  (See my review of Volvo 1998 S70 T5).

The handling is superb, with perfect balance and instant response.  I like it better than the 911s, actually.  I've heard that Porsche's senior test driver prefers it, as well.  The engine is a bit underpowered for a Porsche, but stacks up against 911s from the late 80s and doesn't feel underpowered.  Gotta get that cheap price out of somewhere, after all.  The interior switches and accessories seem a little too plastic, but they are largely the same ones used in the 911.  Overall, the car feels solidly built and is an absolute joy to drive.  The next time I want a convertible I'll buy this one again (perhaps a used one).

The soft top is a breeze to operate.  Just latch/unlatch at one point, and press the button for a few seconds.  With the optional windscreen you can have a conversation while driving, and can drive with the top down in any weather not involving precipitation.

Porsche purists sometimes scoff at this car, but for the $30K+ you saved you can get a whole second car for when you need to cart things around.  The best of both worlds.
