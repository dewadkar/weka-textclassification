            Having finally finished graduate school, I was in the market for a new vehicle.  After examining several options, including the Audi A4, VW Jetta, and the lower-end BMWs, I finally decided to go with the VW Passat GLX Sedan.  I have owned the car for about 2 months now, and in that time period have developed the following list of pros and cons:

Pros
1.  The seats are extremely comfortable. I have a 45 minute commute to and from work, and have never experienced any discomfort.  The GLX model I own has automatic seat adjustment - I found this to be much easier (not to mention fun!) than the GLS model's manual adjustment.  
2.  The car accelerates wonderfully.  Although I haven't measured 0-60, I do know that I have never had to &quot;put the pedal to the metal&quot; in order to pass someone on the highway.
3.  The 4 wheel ABS brakes provide excellent control.  Normal brake usage is comfortable and smooth.  Having just had the opportunity to test emergency braking this morning(thanks to a unobservant minivan) I found that the car slowed quickly but yet allowed me to retain full control of the vehicle.  
4.  The features in this vehicle are just wonderful.  Heated leather seats, automatic moon roof, sound system, trip computer, etc.  This car was clearly on par with its brother the A4 and BMW's comparable models.

Cons
1.  Little interior storage space.  The glove box will fit the instructions and that's about it.  
2.  The 1.8 Liter Turbo 4 cylinder engine on the GLS version is a little underpowered for this car. Although it accelerates well for the most part, the second you take your foot of the gas to coast a little, it feels like you're coming out of warp.  If you're getting a Passat, get the V6.
3.  The cup holders are a little strange.  They are small, not very deep, and are located on the other side of the shift.  This hasn't been a serious concern since I currently have a no-eating/drinking rule, but if you like to eat on the go a lot, this could be a problem.
4.  The entry system can be potentially expensive.  The key itself must be programmed to your car in order to start it, so if you have a tendency to lose your keys, it's $150 a pop.  

There seems to be a large variance to what people have paid for this car.  I ended up paying $26,600 for the car itself, but after adding in the ridiculously overpriced CD changer ($800), both the dealer and I felt comfortable with the price. Keep in mind there are no dealer holdbacks for Passats, so the invoice you find on the Internet is probably pretty darn close to what they paid.  The car comes with free scheduled maintenance for 2 years/24k and many VW dealerships offer free scheduled oil changes.

Summary - a nice German car with a lot of luxuries for a reasonable price - but don't get the GLS 4 cylinder, get the V6. <br><br>
