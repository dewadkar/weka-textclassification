            I am just a leisure photographer and a techno-geek.  So I love new electronic gadgets, yet aren't really into the essense of photography.  I had a 1.3 mega pixel Fuji MX-700 (if I remember correctly).  I was disappointed by the camera's poor indoor picture quality so I decided that the next digital camera I get must be "indoor superior".  After many researches and playing around with various cameras, I decided on Olympus 4040zoom, and  here's my review after one month of usage.

Getting the deal : I got mine from Ebay.  A camera bag was included.  Total include s&h is $643.  While researching for the deal, I found many NYC "Jewish" vendors have gone on-line.  And by the reviews, I see they are still hit or miss.  Living in NYC since childhood, I've dealt with them for over 20+ years.  If you find a good one, you get a tremendous deal.  Otherwise, you are screwed.  I would be careful dealing with any of them.  A head up, check store hours and you'll know if you are dealing with one of the jewish stores (they often close saturday).  A good jewish dealer I dealt with was Tri-state ($649 when I was looking), I almost bought this camera from them again, but I realize I can save $48 off NY tax by getting it from ebay.  Too bad.  Anyhow, be careful, make sure you are getting a US version and not international version/grey market.  Many will also sell you ridiculous mark up accessories.  

Functionality: Oh my god, there are so many features, I haven't fully use them all.  USB ports, various picture adjustments, flash, zoom.  I guess, just check the specs and you'll know.  No drivers for the camera either, very nice.  This camera is not ideal for making it a webcam, so if you wish to use the camera for this purpose, avoid (see fuji mx for this feature).  I haven't used the 360 panoramic views yet, will try out soon.  Take a ntsc 30 seconds movie - this is where if you got an international may hurt.  Good zooming function.

Picture quality : SUPERB!  Indoor, outdoor, all very nice.  It can take any pictures in just about any decent lighting.  While playing around at the store, I feel this camera provides the best indoor picture.  Most camera takes good outdoor picture (better lighting).

Workmanship : sturdy built.  But then it's still a camera, so be careful handling it.

Features I dislike: using smartmedia.  Personally, I love smartmedia.  Small, light, but it's capacity is limited to only 128Meg now.  Hopefully smartmedia capacity will increase to 256 meg soon, and this camera can be upgraded to use 256meg.  Why limit movie to only 30 seconds?  A bit too bulky.  The lens automatically "zooms" out when you turn on.  If you desire more storage, consider non-smartmedia camera.

Extras: Since I am not a good photographer, I almost never buy accesories, until this camera.  I've since then bought a 1.5 telephoto lens, a macro/wide angle lens, uv lens, and a polarizer lens.
