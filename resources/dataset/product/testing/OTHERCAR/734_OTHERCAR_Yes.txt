            For an economical first vehicle, or for someone who demands reliability, you can't do much better than the Mazda B2200 series of pickups.

I bought this pickup as my first vehicle back in 1996. I was in college then, and simply needed something to get me to and back from school. I wasn't looking for options or style, but for affordability and practicality. I found both in this vehicle.

You don't see too many of these pickups in the classified ads or on dealer's lots, and that's because they are simply too reliable...no one wants to get rid of them! I can leave my pickup outside over a cold Minnesota winter night, and be sure that it will start in the morning. I don't have to worry about unexpected trips to the mechanic, because for as long as I've been performing the scheduled maintenance, I haven't had any problems with it. And speaking of performing maintenance, those of you who like to tinker with engines or who like to do simple maintenance like changing oil will appreciate the easy accessibility to most all of the user-serviceable parts.

I can't complain much about the quality of the ride while driving, either. The pickup handles as well as others in its class. The only negative points I can think of for this pickup are simply annoyances at worst. First, it becomes relatively noisy inside the cab once you approach and pass the 60mph (100kph) mark. Even with the windows up, the road noise requires you to turn up the radio in order for it to be audible. Second, the bench seat becomes somewhat uncomfortable after two to three hours of non-stop driving. For making short trips around town, the seats are just fine. However, if you're planning to take a longer trip, I would recommend stopping and getting out to stretch more often than normal.

I bought a model without air conditioning, which, when the weather becomes hot, is difficult to deal with, especially in stop-and-go commute traffic. Once out on the highway with the windows down, however, it is much cooler, although I would still recommend looking for a model that comes with A/C if you're in the market for one of these pickups.

Overall, this series of pickups in an excellent investment. I've had reports from other B2200 owners that their pickups have lasted well over 220,000 miles before requiring any type of significant replacement or repair of parts. While your experience certainly may vary, I am on track to meet this goal with my pickup. With regular maintenance and a little extra bit of owner care, you can expect your pickup to last a long, long time.<br><br>
