            We bought one in June and have been very pleased with it, We got the LS version ride is comparable to Seville ( I think better) for about half the price, more room in back seat than the Seville ( aunt and uncle have new sls) good power not a hot rod but strong  passing gear I like the cassete and cd system (could use disc changer) nice sound auto is quiet running, the commercial is right, 1st car in a long time I really liked to drive just to go for a ride, bucket seats looks best seats 5 comfortably plenty of room in passenger side handles good to not a bmw but a lot cheaper, lots options that usually costing $10 to $20 k more I wood recommend it to anyone 20 something age group seems to like it We didn't get sunroof not worth next package ($2000) and did not want leather seats no problems with at all   Doug Williams <br><br>
