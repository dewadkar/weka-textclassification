            I bought my Cabrio in July 2000 and have had a very enjoyable experience with the car. I drive it daily year round and it has a bit of pep and handles well in traffic. It really helps my mood to take the long way home through the mountains in the summer with the top down. Speaking of which, the top is of very high quality and keeps the interior fairly quiet on the highway.

I'm 6'2" and the interior head room is adequate and the seats are very comfortable (the GLS heated seats are excellent in the winter). The trunk is surprisingly roomy and holds enough stuff for a weekend camping outing. I've not sat in the back seat, but two adults are comfortable back there for a short jaunt. 

The only negatives I can come up with are the brake squeal when it is cold (below freezing) and the clutch. Since the squeal goes away when the brakes warm up and braking performance is very good, I tend to believe the dealer's story that it is the materials in the shoes. Also, I like a short clutch travel and the clutch is a bit long and heavy for my tastes.

Overall, a great car and I'm looking forward to owning it for many more years.
