            I bought the 91 Subaru Legacy Wagon because of the all wheel drive and it's convenient features. The metallic blue exterior was also a nice touch. I loved the ride on this car because it never lost any grip on the road and it had a smooth ride. The seats were very comfortable. On the down side, the regular 4 cylinder engine wasn't powerful when it came to steep hills. On one particular hill on the highway where the speed limit was 65, I could only go 45 at the most. Another down side was in the way they designed the dashboard and the windshield. It allowed more sunshine to come down on the front passengers legs than most sedans and you would have to use the air conditioning a lot more during the summer. If power is your main concern get the turbo version for this year instead. Short drivers may have to stretch to reach the gas and brake pedals.<br><br>
