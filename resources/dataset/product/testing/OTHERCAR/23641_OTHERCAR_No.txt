            I bought this vehicle because of course I wanted a bigger family car and room for my dog to travel in. I have never been so satisfied with a car as I have with my Cherokee. It is stylish enough to go out to dinner or travel in the snow. I very highly recommend a Jeep Cherokee..not only for the room but for the dependability! We have had it for only 3 months but have driven in the snow and made several trips to the desert. It has a great towing capacity perfect for a boat, trailer or jet ski. You can basically go anywhere in the vehicle and it great for off-road driving.<br><br>
