            They really don't.  If you want a convertible Labaron GTC you will have to buy it second hand.  The New Sebring has taken it's place.    Mine is Wild Berry and Champagne and I love it.  My baby gets put away for the winter.  Summer months I am cruising as my children call it.

There have been a few times it's been out in bad weather and it handles well in ice, snow conditions.

The car it self is sturdy and loaded with power everything.  It has a boot to cover the back when you put down the top that makes the car look classy and sporty at the same time.


The exterior is durable with plastic side panels and trim which means no rust on those parts ever.  The rest of the car has held up good no rust at all.

It has a large trunk and bucket seats very comfortable.  It will seat four adults easy, 2 in the front and 2 in the back. It is really not a car for children. (no roll bar.)

I have had no engine problems, only brakes due to a faulty switch and that was covered under warranty.  Just pre-maintenance costs and visits to the shop is all.        

It has an anti-theft security and automatic ignition interlock system, the best is the key in ignition reminder.  The car will not start if the system is not disarmed.

There is an instrument panel that will flash if a problem exist.

The car rides smooth, the gas pedal is a little hard to push for some  but there is always cruise control if your foot gets tired and it has anti-lock brakes.

Only 2 miner negative things would I like to mention.

When I first popped the hood to add wiper flood I could not find the container and had to ask for help.  It is at the top of the engine base close to the windshield.  Everything else under the hood is in plain sight.

The surface does not have a natural luster or sheen it must be waxed and buffed out.

It is a good car and I wish they still made them.    <br><br>
