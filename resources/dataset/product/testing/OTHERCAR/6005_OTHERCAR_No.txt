            I purchased a SAAB 900s hatchback in 1997.  After the 2nd month the vehicle made a &quot;groaning&quot; noise from the engine.  The SAAB dealers were helpful with the service, however unable to diagnose or fix the problem.  The vehicle was in for service 10 times for a total of 47 days.  Unable to fix the problem with the help of SAAB specialists, I asked them to give me fair blue book value on a trade in.  The told me they couldn't do that but made me a very generous offer of $11,500 plus only $1000 over invoice on a new car.  I still owed $14,000 on the original loan.  With their take it or leave it offer I would have incurred another $30,000 of debt.  Unable to sell the vehicle due to the noise, I had little option.  I made numerous attempts to get $17,000 from SAAB and they said too bad.  As a last ditch effort I called a lemon law attorney, and despite a 12 month state lemon law I sued SAAB and won.  Saab could have been fair and offered me the Blue Book Value and we would have both been happy, instead it cost SAAB $30,000 and made me elated.  I hate having to sue but they left me little options.  
Thanks for poor customer service<br><br>
