            This car is everything I could ask for and more!  I needed a new car after the transmission in my Caravan died.  This new (okay, used) car needed to be a commuter car (ie get good gas mileage) and it also needed to be big enough to haul around my toddler and all his associated stuff AND be able to accommodate another car seat when we had a second. 

Now, needs and wants are 2 separate things and after driving base model Saturns and a base model Caravan, I wanted leather, a V-6, a moon roof and style.  I wasn't sure if I could get all I wanted for the price I was willing to pay, but I got it all and MORE!  I found a '95 Toyota Avalon, XLS on eBay (edsfloridacars) with 73,000 miles on it.  It was in amazing shape and only needed new tires.  I bid on, and won the car, for $6700 in Oct '03.  It was delivered 10 days later and I absolutely fell in love!

This car is so roomy; I can sit behind the drivers seat with the drivers seat fully back and still have about 6 inches between my knee and the seat.  Since I'm 5'9 and my husband in 6'0, that's pretty impressive!  I can also get 2 car seats in the back and an average size adult can fit in back as well.  Since all three seats in the back are LATCH capable AND have over the shoulder seat belts, I have no problem with putting even 3 car seats back there!

As mentioned above, I needed decent gas mileage to make this car affordable to my husband and I typically will get 23-25 mpg (or about 400 miles to a tank of gas) on my commute to work which is GREAT!  When I first drove the car, I wanted to test out the acceleration since that was also a big issue with me.  I was SO tired of having to turn off the AC and the radio in order to get enough power to accelerate on to the Beltway here in Northern VA- well, I lightly pressed the accelerator and I was doing 60 mph without realizing it!   This car is the smoothest thing I have ever driven and it doesn&#146t mess around with acceleration.  I will routinely do 80mph on the highway and this car makes it feel like child&#146s play.  The steering is tight and responsive; there is almost NO play in the steering wheel which definitely makes me feel better when I&#146m driving on slick roads!  We just had an ice storm here and this car took that and the snow in stride- I had absolutely zero problems getting where I needed to go- regardless of the road conditions.  I had the opportunity to check out the ABS during the ice storm as well and it gets top marks from me!  The car NEVER slid or got out of control, I could feel the ABS kick in a couple of times and felt just as comfortable driving on the ice as I do driving on dry pavement.  The other things I like about this car are that it has a pretty tight turning radius which is nice when you are flipping a u-turn and even though it&#146s a large car, it fits nicely in my garage with plenty of room to spare for my Ford Expedition.

The luxury appointments in the car make me feel like I&#146m in a much more expensive car than what I paid for.  The leather is fabulous, the climate control works like a champ, the moon roof amuses my son, and the interior just makes me feel good.  The seats are super comfortable and I like driving a heavier car since I know it&#146ll take more than an Escort or Saturn to do damage to me, my child and my car.  I also like the fact that BOTH front seats have electric controls on them.  The only other &#147luxury&#148 appointment that I could wish for is heated seats and I&#146m sure I&#146ll get them in my next car :)  I also love the fact that the heater starts kicking out heat almost immediately.  I&#146ve never had a car that could do that before and it&#146s nice when it&#146s 20 deg outside in the morning!

As previous posters have stated, the wind noise is kind of a pain, but definitely not something I&#146m willing to spend money on to correct.  The radio went bad about 2 weeks ago, but I ordered a new one on Crutchfield for about $280 and it&#146s going to be installed shortly.  My old one was a tape player only and I was able to get a single DIN CD / tape player for all my books on tape.  I also don&#146t like the fact that the trunk release is in the glove box.  I don&#146t know why that irritates me so much, but it does.  I wish the back seats had the 60/40 split, but the trunk is so large, I can fit several weeks worth of groceries plus strollers, etc in there with no problem.  Another very minor thing that irritates me are the cup holders.  They&#146re pretty flimsy so I end up having to grab my drink before I turn so they don&#146t flip over.  I also wish that the cigarette lighter worked when the car is turned off.  I like to charge my phone in the car and if I&#146m in and out of stores, the phone never gets charged.

All together, I am so thrilled with this car that I&#146m looking forward to driving it until is has over 200k miles.  I don&#146t think I&#146ll ever get tired of driving this sporty, responsive, powerful, easy to drive car and I want to own it for a long, long time!  With Toyota's known reliability, I don't think that it's going to give me ANY problems!
