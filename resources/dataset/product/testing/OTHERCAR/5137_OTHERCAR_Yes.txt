            I rate this vehicle very good compared to others in it's class, both for price and quality. The front seats in the new Dodge Dakota are to small and are not very comfortable. Other than the seats being to small the rest is fine. There is plenty of room in the cab. Recommendation neither the plug-in  in the cigarette lighter outlet or the optional electrical outlet neither one works unless the key is turned on. My wife drives this vehicle and is very pleased with it except for the seats. The gas mileage is better than most 6 cylinder trucks,it uses the lowest grade of gas. The best thing about the new Dodge Dakota is that you don't have to change oil for the first 7,500 miles, not like other trucks that you have to change the oil every 3,500 miles. We tow a boat with this truck and find it very easy with no problems with the trailer swerving like it does in other trucks. There is plenty of power to pull the boat up ramps even when the boat is loaded with people and gear. We do have to add about 200 pounds of weight in the back of the truck in winter. The truck tries to slid on snow and ice without the extra weight in the back and you get better traction with 200 pounds of extra weight in the back. you might consider this before you drive on snow or ice. We enjoy this vehicle and would like to see dodge change the seats in the future models.<br><br>
