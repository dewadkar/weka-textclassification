            In search of a deal, I walked the Honda and Toyota used-car lots. I found several prospect a year or two old with low to average mileage, but the price tag didn't feel used. The temptation to spend $15,000 on a used Honda forced me to cross the street and at least rule out a Saturn.

Frankly this is what I told the salesman. After several days of aggressive bird dogging salesman following me up and down each row of imports, I expected nothing less at Saturn of Aurora. I was wrong. After promising to &quot;rule Saturn out,&quot; the salesman acknowledged saying that's fair enough. Walk abound, take your time and let me know if there is anything I can do for you. He walked away. I nearly fell over. So we did look. My wife and I walked the lot and found an SC2 3 door coupe we liked. 

From the outside it looks sporty and sleek. I refused to allow my wife to purchase another nerd mobile, a.k.a. 88 Chevy Nova. This was her new car purchase so she test drove. It's a bit tight inside for a big guy, but very nice if you're not 6'2&quot; and 245. The back seats are snug. This is not a family car, but the third door behind the drivers door does make the back easily accessible. 

The sun roof is a nice option, but at $700 - a bit pricey. I'm not sure I would pay for the option, but in our case the price was right. We followed the advice of The Tightwad's Car Buying Guide. Rule number one, always buy the car near the end of the month. The dealer does not want to pay the manufacturer another months interest. It is easier to drop the price and sell it. Second rule, minimal options- they may end up being free. More about the sun-roof. If you are tall, you may not want it as it cuts down on head room by a couple inches. You might think this is not much, but it's worth saying again. It is a tight fitting car. The sun roof was $700. We told the dealer the only option we wanted was the CD. He went through his inventory to discover a lot full of Saturn's were basically loaded.

We pretended to discuss a &quot;non-negotiable&quot; price for a bit and didn't really get anywhere. To make a long story short, we were prepared to walk on the deal because the options were too high. Low and behold the options started to become included for free. Free sun-roof, free tire and rim option upgrade, and discounted tint. We bought the car.

The rear hatch/ truck area is roomy and the 16 cam engine is nice. With only four cylinders, the 16 cam engine is a must. Good pep for a four banger. All in all, a nice vehicle with many options you'd expect to find in an Acura. Cruise, tilt steering, security alarm, remote access key locks, full leather, rear defrost is lightening fast, duel air bags and of course A/C. 

For you union supporters, the vehicle is 98% America built. Spend the $176 dollars on the bra. It adds a sporty look to the front end. <br><br>
