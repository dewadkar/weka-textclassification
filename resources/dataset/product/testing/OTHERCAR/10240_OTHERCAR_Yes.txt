            I agree totally with the author.  I too love my Lexus.  Its sleek, fast, and headturning appearance, certainly are wonderful.  But I have a few more drawbacks than my friend.  Its acceleration is nice, but it tends to be a little jerky when switching geers and its &quot;over-taught&quot; controls are just a little too responsive for my tastes.  The lack of cup holders is also a major drawback for large families or thirsty drivers, but they can always be added on later.
I'm not sure if its just my dealer, but the service is great.  It's extremely quick, all the staff are usually very helpful, and its surprisingly affordable for such a high quality car.
Anyone who has already owned a lexus, or any high preformance vehicle, and needs a little extra room should definately buy this vehicle.  Although some of the more affluent families would be tempted to buy this car for their teenager because of its myriad of safety features; i would not recomend it.  First off, its too smooth for a new driver to acurately judge how fast he or she is actualy going, and its a little too nice to be banged around the school parking lot.  Overall I'd say its a great car, a great buy, and a great driving experience.<br><br>
