                 I got a very very good deal on one of these cameras about a year and a half ago.  I started using it with regular batteries and it was costing me a fortune so I switched to Nickel Metal hydride. They had a very short life between recharging but saved money in the long run.  The picture quality in bright sun or when using the flash isn't bad,  it is okay for basic web pages and sending email pictures to friends out of state. It is not near the quality to use for important events instead of your traditional camera.  In low light even a slightly over cast day the shots come out very grainy and dark.  It is even worse than trying to shoot with 100 speed film in that aspect.  Recycle time on the flash isn't to bad with the new Duracell ultra batteries but with any thing else don't expect to get two quick shots off in a row.  If you want a cheaper camera for the quick picture around the house to send to relatives this isn't your worst choice.  If you do but it invest in a Smartmedia External Drive.  With this you can slide your smart media cards into the slot and download a whole card's worth of pictures in less time than it will take you to download one from the camera.  Also my color LCD stopped working after about a year.  With it not running it improves battery life and I guess I will live with it until I can purchase an Olympus digital camera in the next couple months. Price listed is for the kit with the smart path adapter.
