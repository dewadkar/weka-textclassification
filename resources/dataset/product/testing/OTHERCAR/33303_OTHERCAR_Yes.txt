            I think the Subaru Forrester is a very underrated SUV.  I have been driving one for about a year without any major problems.  It is not one of the bulky, oversized SUVs but a midsized one with great acceleration and mobility.  I drive a stick-shift and I find that gives it a sports car type feel with more room.  It hugs the road and handles potholes great.  The optional all-wheel-drive also has helped me handle the tough New England winters.  I like the trunk space, similar to a Subaru Outback, but slightly bigger.  It has a great look to it and gets great mileage.  I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
