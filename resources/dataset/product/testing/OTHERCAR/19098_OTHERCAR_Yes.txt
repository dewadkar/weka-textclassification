            When I bought mine, they came in all colours, with all the creature comforts.  It wasn't bad for a first SUV.  It was peppy, yet economical at the gasoline pumps.  The pick up is wonderful, and the interior room isn't all that bad.  There seemed to be more room for back seat passengers than front seat passengers.  The trunk, cargo area lacked sufficient room to satisfy me.  It was difficult to fold the rear seats up with the seat as far back as it needed to go.  Always had to move both the driver and the passenger seat forward to turn the rear seats up to obtain the most cargo area.  Also, it seemed a little to small to tow all but the smallest trailer.  Then I went to sell it.  Depreciation kills me!  I highly recommend for a first SUV<br><br>
