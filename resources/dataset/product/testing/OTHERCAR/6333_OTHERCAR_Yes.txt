            Recently I decided it was time to give up my Grand Caravan (it had over 120k miles and was starting to sound sick).  I decided to try the Sienna.  This turned out to be harder than I expected!  The dealer was having problems keeping a stock (of Siennas) on hand!  When I finally got my ride I could see why!  I thought I liked minivans, but had never been in the Sienna.  I quickly learned that I loved the Sienna!  The vehicle felt and sounded SOLID!  The wheelbase was narrower and shorter than what I was used to so the van handled more like a car than a truck.  While the Sienna was a little narrower than my previous vehicle, once inside it seemed at least as roomy.
The interior was very well thought out and most controls were intuitive.  The flexibility in the seating and ease of folding down the rear seats (or of removing them) was a pleasure.  And there was no long list of options to be concerned with.  All the goodies were already standard!
I did notice that the suspension was a bit hard on rough roads and there was more road noise than expected.  There was also noticeable wind noise from the right sliding door when siting in the front passenger seat.  This could have been restricted to the van I bought as it is the only one I have ridden in so far.
Still and all, I found the Sienna head and shoulders above any other minivan I have seen!<br><br>
