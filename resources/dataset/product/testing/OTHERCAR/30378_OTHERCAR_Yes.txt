            I will always love it, however, the 2001 Pontiac Aztek is not exactly what it seems at first. Yes, I admit. Its design is something that originated from a designer with a little too much to drink, but as you own the Aztek longer, you grow to love the design. When I first sat down in the driver seat, a very comfortable and roomy driver's seat I might add, I was hyped and wanted to go driving over the many hills of southern Indiana. And that I did! This baby is very smooth off-road, which is weird because for some reason, it handles better off-road than on. Sometimes I'm a little scared to make some sharp turns because the Aztek has slight roll problems. You won't tip over but on those 20mph sharp turn on-ramps, I'll actually obey the speed limit. 

The interior would look great, if only it were made out of a more expensive material. I'd spend the extra thousands of dollars for better material, because the "milk gallon plastic" is not very stylish, nor is it durable. My friend who smokes has already burned a hole in my dashboard. I promptly kicked his @$$.

The extras are nice. The mattress is very firm, and well, it's a mattress. You get a six-disc CD player and some other stuff, but there are no words that can sum up this SUV, except for "Wow, but what the hell is milk gallon plastic crap!"
