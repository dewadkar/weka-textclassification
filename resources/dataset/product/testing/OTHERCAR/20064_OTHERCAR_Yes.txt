            We bought our Yukon when our first child was born.  We wanted something that would be safe and sturdy.  We test drove Jeeps, Blazers and Suburbans, but we loved the Yukon for it's power and luxury.  We bought our Yukon used, but what a great used car!  How many cars are so well built that they retain their value after a few years of use? Not too many.  There are leather seats, a TON of cup holders, electric adjustable seats, and even a lumbar support! It also has three outlets for cell phones, tv's, or anything else you can plug in. Plus, we can haul almost anything we need to in it.  I am able to get my baby in as well as long tables.  There is also a ton of room for backseat passengers, even with the front seats pushed all the way back. This is NOT a throw away car! This is the type of car you buy and drive for years and years.  It is just a great, safe, family car.<br><br>
