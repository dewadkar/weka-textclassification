            I was impressed with the size of this Fuji, although not the smallest around. It's easy to fit in your pocket because it is quite thin, at least in comparison to other cameras I have used such as the Olympus D340R and 360. It is also quite light.

The battery life on this camera really impressed me since I used it for more than a week in Egypt without changing the batteries, and taking hundreds of pictures, sometimes with flash and the LCD. (obviously battery life is increased by using the viewfinder rather than the LCD screen).

I found the picture quality to be good, especially during the day without the use of flash. The only problem I found with the camera was using the flash in very dark shots at night left several white spots on the pictures and I could not determine if this was dirt on the lens or what else, but this only happened in these circumstances.

It is definitely worth getting a camera with a USB connection since this makes connecting to a computer much easier and much much faster than a serial connection. I could transfer and play with all the pictures without having to plug in the camera to the wall socket, which was also a good thing.

The on screen menu is easy to use and it is also easy to save pictures for protecting against deleting or for printing...
