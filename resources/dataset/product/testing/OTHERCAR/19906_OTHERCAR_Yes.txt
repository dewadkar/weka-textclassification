            Well Dodge pleased me a second time with my purchase of a 1996 Dodge Dakota.  I purchased this vehicle as had had 10 years of good service from a Dodge Caravan.  This truck actually  rides like a car, not beat you to death.  This truck handles with ease.  The braking system is excellent as is the cruise control system.

The body of this truck is made extremely safe and sturdy.  I found this out for real when an 18 wheeler truck side swiped my truck on the driver's side.  The truck was virtually unharmed except mirrors and paint.
There was absolutely no structural damage to the truck.  I contribute this to excellent engineering of the frame of the truck.  

There is one drawback to the Dodge Dakota that seems to be a drawback of all Dodges.  The Fan Blower system and compressor to the air-conditioner goes out far to quickly, but of course out of warranty.  Dodge really needs to work on this item. 

The Dodge Dakota of course is not for anyone who needs to transport extra passengers.  The extended cab seats are not meant for long trips, or for frequent transport of passengers. However is a excellent truck for hauling when a higher priced truck is out of the question this is a good 
choice, as is durable and reliable.  Both men and women would like this truck.  I am a woman, and enjoy driving this vehicle, it certainly does 
NOT make you feel you are driving a tank that you have to wrestle as many 
trucks make you feel. In fact many small cars do not drive as well.

All in all this is a very good to excellent truck that anyone would enjoy
owning.

All in all I would recommend this truck to most anyone.<br><br>
