            	When I went shopping for new truck last winter I considered all of the following: engine, cab size, hauling load, ride, and handling ability.  So far in the four months I have had the truck I have not had to take it to the shop once,  the oil change was the easiest i've ever done, and all around I have had a great time with the truck.
	So far I have driven the truck from Minneapolis Minnesota, to Fort Wayne Indiana, taken it off road twice, and driven it in stop and go traffic every Monday through Saturday and nothing has even come close to going wrong.  As just the way I am I beat the heck out of trucks and with my driving record and just the way I am I'm very suprised and pleased about the performance of MY DODGE. 
	I recently switched from ford (junk) to dodge and this is my second Dodge Ram 1500.  I would highly reccomend that you consider Dodge when you go out looking for a new truck!!!<br><br>
