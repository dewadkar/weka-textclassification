            Drivers who just want to get from point A to point B will appreciate the nicely equipped, Honda 2 door EX coupe�s price tag. At $17,000, the Honda Civic will take drivers from point A to point B with ease.  There are three Civic models to choose from: EX, LX, and DX.

The DX and the LX are basically the same. The LX has power windows, mirrors and locks while the DX does not. Both DX and LX have 115 horsepowers, at 6100 RPM. In addition, both DX and LX models has 110 ft. lbs. of torque at 4500 RPM.

The EX is the top of the line Honda Civic. It is equipped with 15" wheels, while both DX and LX is equipped with 14" wheels. Also, the EX model has power sunroof to make driving extra fun during sunny days. Not only the EX is nicely equipped, a 127 horsepower (at 6300RPM) engine gives the driver decent power. Furthermore, the Civic EX is equipped with VTEC and four more ft. lbs. Of torque than the Civic DX and LX. At over 4000 RPM, VTEC kicks in. The valve opens wider to suck more air in. As a result, the driver feels a thrust that will make him smile.

The Pros

The Civic is a bargain! The rear seats fold down to give more trunk space for long items, like skis and hockey sticks. No need to buy special ski holders and drill holes on the roof! With VTEC, the driver will have a fun time driving city streets and highways. Civics are also known to be fuel efficient. A 4 cylinder Civic EX, with an automatic transmission, consumes 1 gallon of gas for every 32 miles driven in the city. In highways, 1 gallon is used for every 37 miles driven. In other words, the Honda Civic EX will go 488 miles before it finally runs out of gas! As gas prices go up, SUV owners will be frustrated as the driver of a Honda Civic will be proud of owning an Ultra Low Efficient Vehicle.

Audiophiles will not like Honda Civic�s stock sound system. At full blast the Civic�s sound system fails to meet the demands that audiophiles expect. The bass distorts and the treble is way too high. Also, drivers will be disappointed and say, �Is this loud as it gets?� The only sure way to deal with Civic�s poor stereo is to buy Alpine car stereos from an electronics dealer and upgrade the deck and speakers. By doing so, the driver will listen to a mobile concert, guaranteed.

Recommended for

Mostly for teens. Most adults will also not mind driving a Honda Civic. For people who just want to have a ride, the Civic is a must for $17,000. Even the resell value is great. Because of Civic�s popularity, the driver will also minimize depreciation making trade ins easier. As a first car, the Civic is also perfect for teenagers.

Not Recommended for

People who want power for their money. Drivers who want more power should test drive the Toyota Celica GT (140 horsepower), Acura Integra LS (140 horsepower @6300RPM), and the Ford Mustang (V6 190 horsepower).

Other than power and the stereo, Civic has a great resell value and gas mileage. In the long run, the Civic will end up saving the driver hundreds of dollars. The Civic does look cute but people will say, �you made a smart decision and bought a car that saves a lot of gas. It is no wonder that the Civic is a great car with a great price!
