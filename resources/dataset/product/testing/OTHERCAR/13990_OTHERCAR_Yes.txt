            Excellent car, the best ride I ever had...  Prior to my Honda, I owned a 95' Ford Mustang, and sadly to say, everything that can go wrong with a motor vehicle, happened with the pony.  Needless to say, it was put out to pasture and I then made a purchase of the 95' Honda Accord V6 EX with the advice of my father and after reading the review at consumerreports.org.  I've owned it for more than a year now, and never took it to the shop.  Everything in the car is very well laid out.  The leather seats are so comfortable, I wish I could rip em out of the car and use it as my home easy chair.  Plenty of leg room both in front and in back.  This Honda is truly like taking a ride on the lap of luxury.  But enough about the comforts, lets talk about driveability and horsepower.  This car has excellent acceleration, and the turns are very crisp.  When turning in reverse, the steering wheel automatically adapts to the turn and assists.  The V6 is very quiet, much quieter than the noisy VTEC 4 cyl.  An excellent car, I plan to buy a newer model Accord or Civic when my father purchases my Accord.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
