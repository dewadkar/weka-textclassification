            I bought my 300E in September 1990 - the car market was depressed and I could get a pretty good deal on the car as a result.  It was the first Mercedes I had owned; my Dad had had a few in his time and they had proved comfortable and reliable vehicles, so I knew this would be a pretty secure purchase.

I remember reading an automotive review of the car which called it &quot;Teutonic in its simplicity&quot;.  Yes, that summed it up pretty well.  There are no &quot;frills&quot; on a '90 300E - this is a serious car (see my 2000 E320 review for contrasts).  The steering wheel does not tilt or move at all!; the drivers side mirror is manually operated by a little &quot;stick&quot; (the passenger side is powered); floormats cost extra!; the radio is AM/FM/Cassette, but the features would be worthy of a MUCH lower priced car (sounds really good tho). The seats are very firm but have millions of adjustments via power controls in the door, which is the only really decadent part of the car, excepting the genuine wood trim.

The doors have a fabulous &quot;slam&quot; to them - but make sure you close the back doors with a window or other door open or they do not shut completely airtight and you can hear road noise through them.

Driving the car is fabulous - this car has completely predictable handling; tight in curves, steering is very precise; at the time the 300E was considered the &quot;drivers&quot; Mercedes - and it really was, too.  I LOVED driving this car on a windy road or even a straight freeway - it handles so well.  The car is heavy and solid - after 10 years it had never developed a rattle at all.  Amazing.  When changing tires, make sure you get ALL wheels aligned - unlike many cars (and the claims of the tire places) these cars DO need rear alignment and few places have the equipment to do it.  I once had only the front wheels aligned and the car did handle comparatively poorly until I corrected that.

Braking always had a little soft feeling to me - after talking with the dealer and driving other 300E's this does seems to be the norm for the car.  It does have ABS, but I never really tested that even in very wet winters.

Engine is an in-line 6 cylinder - open the hood and be amazed at how much room there is in the compartment.  Service costs for the 300E (at Mercedes dealers) was no more expensive than any Japanese or American car I had owned - in reality it was lower as the car was so strongly made.

The car was Midnight blue - a real head turning color - after 10 years it was still deep and rich and was still getting compliments.

The trunk is large and easy to access as the lid opens up to the vertical.  Two pockets inside allow the transportation of more fragile items without them slamming around the trunk.  Great idea.

The full sized spare in the trunk is a boon - be sure when you change tires to keep the best and have it fitted to this wheel.

After 10 years and 150K miles, I sold this car and bought its younger brother.  I would buy another as these cars are really good value for the money since they last so well.  Paid $48K in 1990, sells for $12K today - not bad value retention.
