            The first looks show the curves and bulges.  You may be asking yourself whether it is bigger.  Yes, it is!  It is clear that the Japanese SUVs are making their mark on our roads.  For the most part, a lot of them have had a good track record.  The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero's flashy and stylish looks cause more than one commuter to take a second look.  <b>It has done something the other SUVs in the same category (4Runner etc.)have not done.  It has departed from the norm.</b>  I had the opportunity to test-drive this new machine this past Sunday on the San Joaquin Valley roads.

<b>Back on the road to visit alma mater and friends in Coalinga</b>
<i>Where in the world is <b>Coalinga</b>?</i>

On a cool Fall Sunday, I hopped into the Montero, ready to visit some of my friends in this small San Joaquin town that was almost destroyed by an earthquake in the 1980s.  I had not set foot in that town for a number of years now.  I just wanted to see again the community college I attended for two years.  West Hills College is one of the hallmarks of the community.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Farms surround it.  If somebody attends this college, there is no way you won't be able to learn.  There are so few distractions.  To a certain extent, it reminds me of Wala Wala college's environment.

<i>Engine and performance</i>

Thanks to its somewhat huge size, the Montero handled the road well.  It is clear that the redesign touched a lot of interior points and added so many details.  It is a job well-done!  The gauges are clear and easy to read.  With its 24-valve, 3.5-liter V6 200 @5.000 rpm horesepower, the Montero did not hesitate to negotiate the turns and twists of the road leading to Coalinga.  <b>In a few words, it rode well, very well </b>.  Driving among fields of corn, onion, orange groves, I did not hesitate to accelerate.  The Montero can go from 0 to 60 mph in about 10 seconds.  Now that's a feast for most guys who are into speed testosterone!

<b>It was time for getting some fuel:  Stop at Harris Ranch</b>

I pulled up at the new Harris Ranch Service Center by Highway 198 and Interstate 5 near Coalinga.  Shell and Texaco are there.  Of course, I went to Texaco.  Not much of a choice.  I pressed on grade 89.  The gas was kind of expensive. <b>A truck with a trailer pulled at at the nearby Convenience store.  The driver is a young cowboy.  He took a few good looks at the Montero parked in front of the Deli. </b> I went in to buy some juice.  A few minutes after, I exited the store and got ready to resume my trip.

The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero appears to have a good transmision.  I never had any problems shifting whenever needed.  It shifted very smoothly.  The gears are fine.  No waste of time and fuel.  I was doing very well on gas.  

<b>Some great features of the Montero</b>

*  Two glove boxes

*  Third-row seat can be folded flat into a bed

*  Extremely beautiful sunroof

*  It is a great improvement from the earlier model.

*  Outside-mounted spare time for more space inside.

*  In one word, more cargo space and first and second-row seats can lie flat to create a bed.

<b>In no time, I reached Coalinga</b>

It was great to see the town, the trees lining the entrance of the college, all the campus trees and flowers.  The college has a great landscape.  A few minutes after, I went to a former friend from church. The conversation soon turned to the most recent news to hit the town.  The state of California had picked Coalinga as the site for a maximum security psychiatric hospital.  This new building will house about 1, 500 of California's most dangerous rapists and child molesters.  (California state law allows any judges or jury to commit predators to a state mental hospital for treatment...)

On the hand, some city residents are happy with the jobs this new hospital will bring.  On the other hand, they are fearful because the city has already had two other prisons:  Pleasant Valley State Prison and the Caremont Custody Center.  I had a good time over B.B.Q.

<b>My final impressions about the SUV</b>

If you are on the market for a Japanese vehicle, the Montero is for you.  Besides the outside looks, you will love the interior's amenities.  You can't go wrong.  This Montero appears mysterious.  Buy it as present to yourself or a loved-one!
