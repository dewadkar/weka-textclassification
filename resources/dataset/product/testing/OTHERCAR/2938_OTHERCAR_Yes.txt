            As many of you may or may not know, many people, particularly those of Asian descent, are modifying their Integras.  My question is, why?

I've driven the coupe however it was an automatic with the standard base 1.8L 140hp rather than the more potent 172hp VTEC model (There was also the limited Type-R model which boasted 195hp and more sports tuning).  Pushing the car hard tends to generate alot of engine noise (especially past 5k/RPM) though performance was sprightly.  This is a car suited to have a standard manual transmission rather than automatic especially on uphill situations.  The ride was comfortable, with some seat support for a sporty drive.  The controls were easy to read, the steering was precise and it gets good mileage.  It is also a very reliable car and great for city driving.

If it's a good car, why mess with it?  Performance?   Changing the original setup is expensive.  For true performance, you're likely to spend at minimum, half the original cost of the car.  Not worth it for normal street driving (driving it exclusively on the track maybe another story).  Not only will you burn up alot more gas; you'll also damage the undercarriage of your vehicle and reduce reliability.

Want muscle performance?  Try a Camaro/Firebird or Mustang, which are in the same price range.  The Integra wasn't meant to drag race.

Imports at this price range ($20~30k) aren't meant for lean mean performance, just a stable, comfortable, reliable ride.  If you're want some performance on an import at this price range, I suggest the Honda Prelude which has a 2.0L 205hp engine if you choose the VTEC model.  Or the costlier Honda S2000 with a 2.0L 240hp engine.  Prices will be at a premium for this limited production car.

The Integra is also due in for a remodel any year now.  This is the same model that was introduced more than 5years ago and is getting dated.  It is also the only Acura model still employing a name rather than a 2 letter model designation (CL, TL, RL).  But then, &quot;if it ain't broke, why fix it?&quot;<br><br>
