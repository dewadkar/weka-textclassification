            I recently bought a 96 Olds.  bravada. Now it's not a brand new one but it still rides like it is.  Before I purchased the Bravada, I had a 1992 Mercury Capri XR2, a little convertible sports car.  I loved my car, but now I have a two year old and wanted her safe.  I was getting tired of looking in the review mirror to see if we were going to be rear-ended or not.  My husband said if I was going to get a new vehicle it needed to be a SUV, number one saftey, number two they hold they're value.  I love my Bravada due to many reasons.  I live in Omaha,NE which is dangerous in the winter time.  My little convertible did great in the snow but was not safe if a collision occured.  My husband has a Ford F-250 4x4 so we had a four wheeled drive vehicle.  It became very difficult to share the truck.  I love the way it handles through the snow, we recently recieved 6 inches of the white stuff, and it handled better than my husbands four wheeled drive.  I took my mother to work, my sister to three different towns, we were safe.  I even took it through unplowed roads. It was the best experience I ever had with a four wheeled drive vehicle. You don't have to lock the wheel to put it in four wheel drive mode it kicks in.  I get the same gas mileage as my four cylinder convertible. I don't feel like I will tip over as I felt when test driving the Explorer. The only complaint I have is I don't have a cassette player.  I have the cd player.  I would recommend buying this vehicle for a family who wants everything in a SUV, that you would find in a car.  At first the price scared me, but now all I can say is I would pay more for the comfort and the safety this vehicle has made me feel.<br><br>
