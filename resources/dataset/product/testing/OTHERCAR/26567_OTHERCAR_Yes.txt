                 I love my 93 Sentra XE.  It's like the reliable girl that your mother would approve of and the one you'd marry.
     I've had a 95 Civic EX and a 95 Neon Sport.  I liked the Civic for its everything but found it a burden to maintain in New York City.  Theft and dings are a Honda owner's worst nightmare.  It's such a hyped-up car that I have no peace with myself as an owner.  Later I sold it to relieve myself of this burden and managed to sell it at a relatively high price.  She was like a hot babe that everyone looked at and thieves wanted to steal away from me.  As for the Neon...  I wished someone stole it.  The Neon is analogous of a drunken one-night-stand.  I could hardly even give it away.  It was unreliable, uncomfortable noisy and was built without quality as a concern.  Do I need to say more?  
     In 1997, I was reluctant to take on my father's 93 Sentra at 55k.  It was ugly and handled like a bicycle.  In the first month, I changed the wheels from 175/70/13 to 185/60/14.  It changed the appearance, handling and braking, not to mention safety, in a dramatic way.  I recommend this upgrade to all Sentra owners as it will change the feel of the vehicle on the road.
     The highlights of my Sentra are as follows: 
 - carefree driving in NYC- often fighting with taxi drivers for road space, unafraid of putting my vehicle in front of a raging yellow cab;
 - carefree parking in NYC- five inches, front and back combined, is typical for parking on the streets of Manhattan; 
 - low vehicle theft rate- yeah, it was broken into a few times in shady neighborhoods, but I learned not to keep anything valuable in the car.  Cost of repairs is low;
 - great fuel economy- driving conservatively helps;
 - adequate power to compete on the road- overdrive off helps in situations where power is require.  cruising at 85 mph is no problem.  My dream is to have my car in a 5-speed; 
 - reliability- other than regular oil changes at 3k miles, the following are unscheduled services.  At 55k, struts (due to leaching friends borrowing the car); at 80k, a new battery; 85k, left axle and 2 boots.  That's not so bad for a car driven hard in NYC.  Honda owners cannot say the same for their unscheduled maintenance visits.  My Sentra was made in Japan and has a timing chain instead of a timing belt, not requiring the change costing about $250.  My Civic also had a leak in the upper engine cover gasket at right under 36k miles and was fixed under warranty.  This would have cost $500+;
 - quiet ride- the vtec engine of the Civic was rather noisy compared to the Sentra at high rpm's.  Some who claim to be Civic enthusiasts like that noise.  To each their own.  At less than 2 years old, there was an annoying ticking sound from the dashboard of the Civic that I couldn't get rid of.  At 107k miles on my Sentra, still very quiet.
     My major quirk is a mini one.  The back seat is so small that passengers cannot put their knees in front of them.  For me, it's a benefit as well since whoever wants to bum off a ride will result in dealing with the consequences.  This is the perfect car for me.<br><br>
