            I bought this camera as a gift for my sister who just had a new baby.  I was and still am a Kodak fan. I own a DC 215 and love it and planned to continue being a loyal customer.  It was bought in a hurry after seeing its price was quite inexpensive and the basic features enough. It was a Megapixel camera with a 2X Zoom, it sounded like a good bargain. I received the package within 3 days. When I opened the package out of the box I saw a simple looking basic black camera.  It did not have the usual &quot;look and feel&quot; of other Kodak cameras.  But in spite of the &quot;plastic&quot; feel, it could still be considered an asset because it is very light. It lacked all of the usual indicators like no. of shots left but the LCD Display was just the right size and not that bad.  The settings for quality could be adjusted and the size can be 4x6 or 5x7. In addition to this, I had a hard time trying to find out how to use the &quot;zoom&quot; feature.  Unlike my DC 215, the zoom was digital instead of optical so you had to make sure that the LCD viewer is switched on. By then you could switch from 1x to 2x and vice versa.  The picture quality for zoom was satisfactory.  I did not notice any degradation of quality when I switched it to 2x and it was quite fast.  Another major difference is that it has a Fixed lens instead of Auto focus but I still have not seen any difference since we've only used it indoors to take pictures of the baby and of course us and the guests of the party. Another caution I need to make is the use of flash. Sometimes, the flash is not needed, especially at smaller distance.  Be sure to check the viewer whenever you get a shot to see if there is too much exposure.  If you see that the picture is too bright then you gotta wear shades, no, I mean, switch off the flash. Settings include &quot;no flash&quot;, &quot;force flash&quot;, and &quot;red-eye reduction auto flash&quot;.
So, in conclusion, I would like to recommend this camera to people who are not pursuing any kind of photography as a hobby because you will be disappointed with the lack of features and &quot;sophistication&quot; of this product.  On the other hand, if you own a point-and-click and satisfied with it this camera would be more than enough for your needs.
