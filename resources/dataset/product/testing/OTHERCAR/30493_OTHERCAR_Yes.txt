            I have owned two corollas and have loved both.  It is a problem free car.  I put my first one through a lot of hard work and it never had any problems.  It gets great gas mileage.  It is small but large enough to be roomy for kids in the back.  It comes with some great options and is very affordable.  I recommend this car to anyone from a single college kid to a married couple with kids.  Especially for those with a budget like myself.  It drives wonderfully and has very little road noise.  Toyota is a great company and the dealerships are very helpful.  I would not recommend a balloon payment however.  I had a balloon payment on my first corolla and I ended up regretting it.   The stereo system in my Corolla is wonderful.  The back seat has a full seatbelt with shoulder strap and all in the middle.  The trunk is rather large and has fold down back seats for carrying larger items.  I love the Toyota Corolla which is why I returned for another one after I traded in my first one.<br><br>
