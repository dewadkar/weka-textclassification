            I have driven Plymouths's...
I have driven Chevys...
I have driven Fords...

None of them were as smooth, reliable or cost effective as my 99' Camry.

I commute about 33 miles to work and 33 miles from work.  Gas efficiency is very important to me, as well as a comfortable ride.  The Camry gives me about 28 miles per gallon (mixed Highway and Street driving).  

I have my Camry serviced every 3-4,000 miles.  With moderate driving, Toyota states that you can have it serviced every 5,000 miles (4,000 works great).  I have been driving it now for about 1 1/2 years and have put 38,000 miles on it.  I believe it will go 100,000s of miles :)
