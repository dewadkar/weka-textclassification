            Here is the deal after dreaming of buying the Grand Prix for over a year when the time came I found that I was older and that the back didn't approve of the stiff suspension and board like seats.  After two days it was returned to the dealer.  Lo   and behold there was this beautiful Intrigue parked beside it when I parked in the dealers lot. One look under the hood showed the similarities.  Taking the test drive drive I realized that this car was going to give me all the horsepower and comfort that I was looking for two thousand less than a comparatable used Grand Prix.  The only problems so far (20,000 miles) is the 2 cent clamps that they used to attach the window moldings.  This is a common problem among other Intrigue owners that I have spoken to.  But it is quite simple to repair.  Also the kids appreciate the comfortable backseat and  the extra room.
