            Some buddies told me about this great little program: test drive an I35 and get a free Palm Pilot.  So I did.  I figured I could get a nifty free new toy and test drive a car; two of my favorite activities.

Infiniti along with Lexus has been known for their great dealerships and service.  The big parent company reign in their dealerships tightly unlike the Germans.  Its a funny thing really, that both Lexus and Infiniti don't exist outside the US at all; those models wear their Toyota and Nissan badges.  Does that say something about American consumers?  Dealing with the sales department was friendly and courteous.  The salesman seemed less informed than I was about the Nissan/Infiniti relationship (for instance, I told him about the new G35 really being a new Nissan Skyline in the rest of the world).

It's also pretty well known that this car is a Maxima.  I have not driven the Maxima at all but have ridden in it in its SE and base forms.  How similiar are they?  They share the same platform, engine, suspension with only changes to the exterior shell and interior pieces.  That said, the Maxima has always been a favorite of mine for a large sedan with plenty of power on tap and half decent handling.  If I had a family 3 years ago and was in the market for a roomy sedan, this car would of been at the top of my list.

To the car.  Step inside the car and you can feel that it is well built and handsome.  My particular test car had the heated seats plus the sport package and sunroof as well.  The seats were covered in a beautifully soft leather, mildly firm, and very relaxing.  There was much maple coloured wood all over the dash of the car, shiny and laquered and seemed to be of good quality.  Shunt lines were very reasonable and tight and pieces seemed well assembled.  However, alot of the plastic bits like the door release levers, the turn signal levers, etc seemed to come straight out of the Maxima.  Not that they were GM flimsy by any means but not very luxurious either.  Compared to the materials used in my Audi A4, they seemed cheaper in comparison.  I will say that the interior *DOES* seem very warm and inviting in contrast to my car.  This seems to be a characterstic of Japanese cars, as a friend's Lexus GS300 had also that same very inviting feel to it.  In contrast, my car seems to feel like an efficient machine, tight, no nonsense but colder with aluminum trim, chrome, instead of wood and more natural toned plastics.  If Audi feels Bauhaus, then Infiniti and Lexus feels Mediterranean.

The layout was very simple to work with.  There were more buttons than I expected but less so than the Germans.  It was intuitive enough for anyone who's driven a Nissan or Toyota.  The room inside was cavernous just like the Maxima as was the trunk as well.  The sound system, like any Infiniti, was wonderful.  Maybe I heard too many good things about it, but I was disappointed.  Bass was very good but not mindblowing.  Highs came out well though the midrange seemed a bit washed to me.  It was better than my stock 8 speaker 80watt system definately but not *a lot* better.

On the outside, I felt the car seemed bland but that is my own judgement.  It had the outlines of the Maxima still there with a few bits and pieces changed over.  There were no wheel arches at all which is a disappoint to me.  It is completely smooth from wheel to door.  I really couldn't find anything exquisite with the exterior at all.  It was blandly generic with not even a subtle amount of flair anywhere.

But now the fun part: driving.  Unfortunately, the area where the dealer was located is on a busy highway here in Northern NJ.  Ask anyone who lives here and you'll find out NJ has the most cars in the nation per square mile and most of them sit up in the northern part.  I did, however, find a little clearing in the road to check out what this car was capable off.

First the engine.  Everyone knows about the legandary Nissan VQ series V6's and this one didn't disappoint.  Mind bogglingly smooth and a broad, broad torque band makes this motor feel like an I6.  The engine note was extremely muted however though you could here a tiny bit of deep bass rumble.  By staying in one gear, I could test the capability of an engine more accurately, as the capabilities of the transmission don't get in the way.  By far, this is one of the better engines I've driven, one of the best V6's around.  I would say it is equal to the Lexus Inline-6's in smoothness.  The BMW I6's have more of a life to them but I have a feeling its due to less sound insolation more than engine design.  That said, if I had to point out the best characteristic of this car, it would be the engine.

But it was the transmission that was a let down.  At 255 hp and 245ft/lbs of torque, I was prepared to be blown away by this car, since I was used to my little 170hp, 166 ft/lbs with my 1.8T.  I too have an automatic (yes, yes don't make fun of me ;)  but with one major difference: a 5th gear.  Yes, this entry level luxary sedan has a FOUR GEAR SLUSHBOX!  As a result, the car, while definately faster than mine, didn't seem to move as fast as I thought it could.  The torque convertor also seemed sloppier than mine as well with lots of engine revving and the car not moving.  The manual shifting mode was interesting and annoying at the same time.  It was also extremely similiar to the Lexus design, that is you have to move up and to the left or right to upshift through a jagged looking gate.  While I appreciate the ability to slam down 2 gears easy, I find the sequential Tiptronic design of mine easier.  To downshift twice, you would have to move down and to the left (or was it the right?) and then down again.  I could do the same on my car by just clicking the steering wheel paddle shifter down twice.  I suppose its a matter of getting used to.

As for the handling of this car, it felt exactly how I envisioned it: tight but large.  Maybe it was the sitting position giving a phychological effect too, but this car felt big.  It felt like a very heavy car but a stiff suspension.  I was, however, surprised that it was surprising supple on bumps and also tight in corners.  It wasn't as tight or progressive as my own car but then again I have aftermarket Koni coilovers which are performance oriented.  Hats off to the Nissan engineers.  Steering was much too light for my taste and there was practically no road feel whatsoever.  I am sure that the Japanese engineers are capable of putting better steering into a car, but the manufacturers still prefer doing it this way.  I suppose the roadgoing public likes the ease of driving with you pinky and being isolated from the road irregularities, but an enthusiastic driver like myself wants a weighted steering for confidence and wants to know how my car is tracking too.  Its better than say a Camry but not alot better than an Accord and nowhere close to an Audi or BMW.

There were 2 major problems in the handling I found though.  The first was in corners.  Any sort of irregularity in the road seemed to upset it.  After glaring through some specs, I found the culprit: The Maxima/I35 uses a beam axle in the rear.  A cheap suspension is a big no, no in today's cuttroat market.  This is akin to the BMW Z3 and its money saving technique of also putting in a beam axel in the rear instead of its famous Z link design in the new 3 series.  Bad, bad car makers!   The other problem was, as others have also found: torque steer.  Generally this is a problem with high torque front wheel drive cars.  The most famous example of this are the higher powered Saabs (Viggens and Aeros) so test drive one of these to find out what torque steer is.  While I rounded a corner, I purposely gunned the throttle and the wheel jerked in my hand as well.  Definately torque steer.  In contrast, my own car (equipped with quattro and a 4-link front suspension) just rounds a corner easily with no suspense at all.  However, it does also have a lot less power.

After all that, we come to the conclusion.  Would I buy this car now.. today?  The answer: NO.  Why you ask?  Cause there's this new car with very nice styling, just as much interior space, an engine thats slightly detuned from this one, with an BRAND NEW platform and NEW rear multilink suspension.  To top it off, its base price is about $5K cheaper! What car is this?  The V6 Nissan Altima.  This car suffers from too much platform sharing much like GM cars.  My own car shares a lot of parts with other cars (A6, Passat) but I can feel the difference.  Smaller wheelbase, better tuned suspension, completely different interior makes it a unique car.  Nissan had over 35 different platforms when it was in red ink and it has since been reduced to about 5 or 6.  They should look over at Volkswagen/Audi to see how to share platforms the right way.

How it compares to competitors:
<b>Non-Luxury Choices</b>
Nissan Altima - I can't stress the Altima enough as the best buy for the Accord/Camry market.  Great engine and great design makes this car a bargain for the price.  You get the new Skyline derived rear multilink suspension and the equally good VQ engine with a slightly less pretty interior and less service.  But for that price point....

Volkswagen Passat - Slightly less expensive but still more than say a Camry, the Passat is a great choice as well.  The power can seem anemic though compared to the I35 and Altima but handles well (though too soft sprung) and has one of the best interiors period.  An optioned out Passat would run roughly $35 with AWD, 190hp V6 vs. a slightly optioned I35 with FWD, 255hp.  Decisions, decision.

Ford Mondeo - Shame we can't get this car here in the States, but this is the successor to the Contour.  It is was the Focus is to the small car market, good handling, decent but slow engines and good build quality.  It depends on money of course and where you live, but you can't go wrong with this car.  (if you *can* get this car, then you would have to compare it with a Maxima since the I35 doesn't exist in the rest of the world)  Former European Car of the Year.

<b>Luxury Choices</b>
Lexus ES - better track record, but the I35 wins in almost every other department.  Get the I35 instead.

Audi A6 series - Around the same price as the I35 with less power in the 3.0 and more in the 2.7T.  Handling wise, with wishbone rears, 4-link fronts, sport suspension, and Quattro AWD system, its a more capable package.  And of course, noone builds an interior like Audi.  The decision comes down to more power and better reliability in the Infiniti vs. better handling, AWD, and German interior in the Audi.

Lexus GS 300 - less power but you get wishbone suspensions all around and RWD.  The price will you run you about $5K overall but you get a better overall performance package in handling plus all that great Lexus service and quality.  Its a tough choice, but it comes down to the almighty dollar.

BMW 5 series -  Hey there expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Better interiors though using a different design philosophy.  What do you get?  For once alot less power.  However, 50:50 weight distribution, RWD, multilink rear suspension... this stuff doesn't come cheap.  There's a reason why Bimmers are as good as they are.  This car is nimble and handles like a dream.  Again, it comes down to the dollars.

Infiniti G35 - this is an updated suggestion but the new G35 is a very good contender into the midsize luxury market.  Fast, great handling, maybe a bit unrefined for a first try but nontheless a very nice car.  This is based off Nissan's new FM (front-mid) platform which is also used in the new Nissan Z350 coupe.
