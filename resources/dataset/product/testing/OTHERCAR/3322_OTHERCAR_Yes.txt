            In late 1995 I was driving a Mazda MVP with 90,000 hard miles on it.  Oil changes with synthetic oil were necessary every 2000 miles to keep engine noise down to a low roar and I feared that a new engine was looming on the horizon.  A new engine, and the time without a vehicle a new engine replacement would take, did not fit my single-Mommy budget or lifestyle.

So I went shopping.  Tired of passenger vans, I had decided to look at SUVs.  My first stop was the Ford dealership, based on reviews I had read and the popularity of the Ford Explorer.  I also visited the Nissan dealership to check out the Pathfinder, the Isuzu dealership to check out the Rodeo, and the Honda dealership to check out the Passport.  I bypassed the Jeep dealership, already aware that a Jeep Cherokee was out of my price range.

<b>A little history about my car ownership experience</b>

I started driving 25 years ago and owned my first car just a few months after I got my license.  My Dad was a do-it-yourself mechanic who loved tinkering with cars, and he was a die-hard &quot;buy American&quot; believer.  So in my first 5 years of car ownership, I owned about 8 different old, American-made jalopies.  Mostly Chevrolet vehicles, but a Dodge and a Ford thrown in for good measure, all were very cheap to purchase and expensive to maintain.  At the age of 21, I bought my first new car - A Honda Accord.  Dad never did more than look under the hood of one of my cars again.

My Honda Accord was a wonderful car, fun to drive, easy to handle, and it looked great!  After a few years I traded it for a Honda Prelude, wanting something a little sportier, then a year or two later I traded the Prelude for a Mazda 626.  (The prelude was just too small.)  I've since owned Honda, Mazda and Ford vehicles.

<b>SUV Shopping</b>

I didn't care for the Explorer.  It wasn't comfortable for me as the driver and there was hardly any leg room in the back seat.  The test-drive was unimpressive and it had a higher price than I wanted to spend.

Next stop was Nissan to test-drive the Pathfinder.  I loved the handling and engine response of the Pathfinder, but again felt caged-in in the driver's seat.

On to Honda to test-drive the Passport.  It was comfortable, the engine was responsive, and it seemed to have more passenger space than both the Explorer and the Pathfinder.  I was sold, but knowing the Passport is made by Isuzu, I moved on to the Isuzu dealer to check out the Rodeo.

The Rodeo didn't impress me, and neither did the Isuzu dealership.  Although I know the same company makes both the Rodeo and the Passport, I found the Rodeo to be a little less comfortable.

<b>Why I bought the Passport</b>

For price, comfort, and performance, the Passport out performed the Explorer, Pathfinder and Rodeo.  Also a factor, I was comfortable with Honda's reputation for quality and service, and I found our local Honda dealership to be very customer-friendly.

<b>I Loved It!</b>

I bought a 1996 Honda Passport LX.  A four-door SUV with a standard 5-speed transmission, shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive, anti-lock breaks, driver and passenger side air bags, tinted windows, reclining front bucket seats and an outside mounted spare tire.

I loved everything about the Passport except the monthly payments and the gas mileage.  (But then, I wouldn't have loved any payments!)  The total price was about $21,500.  It was fun to drive, handled wonderfully in the snow, and was comfortable for me and my passengers.

Gas mileage, about 16 city, 19 highway, was poor, however, and the small gas tank (14 gallons, I believe) meant I made more visits to the gas station than I would have liked, but overall driving experience and ownership was positive.  We take a lot of trips to the North Carolina mountains and the Passport was a dream to drive on curvy mountain roads, regardless of road conditions.

As for service and maintenance, I had no problems except a glitch with the autmatic door locks which was covered by the warranty.  Routine maintenance was provided by my Honda dealership on a convenient schedule with competitive prices and transportation available by shuttle if the Passport had to stay for any length of time.

The only feature of the Passport that I didn't like was the location of the spare tire, mounted on the rear tailgate.  It partially obstructs the view from the rear-view mirror and it took quite a while for me to get used to it.

<b>Why I No Longer Own My Passport</b>

I've got two bad knees, from arthritis, skiing injuries, and who knows what else.  When my driving was primarily highway, using the clutch of the Passport wasn't a problem.  But when I changed jobs and my drive required miles in stop-and-go traffic, it became very painful for me.  In consulting with my doctor, who was planning to do knee surgery for me, he suggested that I switch to a vehicle with an automatic transmission, at least for the first few months after surgery.

So I tried to trade my Passport for a Passport with an automatic transmission.  But gently used Passports in condition and price comparable to mine, were impossible to find.  New Passports were completely out of range for me, during a time when money was a real problem.  Very sadly and reluctantly, I traded my Passport for a Ford Windstar van.  A year and a half later, I still regret making that trade and I really miss my Passport.

<b>My Next Vehicle</b>

In another few months I'm going to be buying a new vehicle again.  The Honda Passport is at the top of my short list of vehicles to test-drive.  Despite the gas mileage, I now realize that an SUV is the best type of vehicle for me.  I will also test-drive a Mazda Tribute, because I like Mazda's quality and service, and only then will I be able to tell you what my next vehicle will be. 

Like me, you'll just have to wait and see!
