            I've had mine for 4 years now and will definately get another one.  When my husband and I were looking for a mini-van that would comfortably fit our 4 children, the Astro van seemed to be the perfect choice of all the vehicles we test drove.  It sat so much higher and felt so much safer than the Windstar or Caravan.  The problem was that my husband has always disliked Chevrolet and said I'd have nothing but problems like we did with a Camaro we had before.  We bought it anyway and I haven't had hardly any mechanical issues at all with the Astro van.  It now has 82,000 miles on it and we just now had to put a new waterpump in it as can be expected. The only other thing was the little circuit board for the windshield wipers that we had to replace that took 5 minutes and $30.00 to do.  The reliablitly of a vehicle with my four children and I run a home childcare business, was extremely important for me and this van has been a perfect vehicle for me.  Away from the mechanics, the only other problem I seem to have is the door frame for the rear door.  I have the model with the two door frames that go up the entire rear of the vehicle, rather than the glass on the upper half and doors on the lower.  Those frames going all the way up does block some of your view when you are backing up so I have to be extra careful. 
The rear air-conditioning is a plus also and I don't think I would have bought the van without it.  Mine doesn't have rear heat, but I see that it is an option you can get but since we live where it doesn't get that cold, it was an issue with us. The van is very comfortable for travel purposes also and the arm rests on both sides of the captain chairs are GREAT for our road trips. This Astro van is large and has alot of room and because of that and the two captains chairs in the front, my friends insist that it's not a mini-van but rather a full size van.
