            When I bought this camera 2 years ago, I might have been able to recommend it. It has some good points, but they are totally outweighed by the bad.

First the good stuff. The camera has a rotatable &quot;eye&quot; that can be rotated to take pictures at odd angles. It is small and lightweight. The LCD on the back is convenient for taking pictures.

Now the bad stuff. First of all the resolution is way too low to take decent quality pictures for printing. The pictures taken by it may be enough for onscreen work such as websites, but if they are printed out they look horrible. Second, The camera has no flash. If you take pictures inside, you will get a very bad quality dark image. Third, There is no removable storage media, this makes it difficult if you want to take a lot of &quot;high res&quot; pictures.

This camera may have been good 2 years ago, but now it is the bottom of the barrel in my opinion. If you are in the market for a digital camera, stay away from this camera unless you only plan to use the pictures onscreen and only plan to take pictures outdoors in the sun. I recommend to go for one of the more expensive newer cameras that have a flash.

Learn from my mistake, don't buy a camera without a flash, you will be sorry you did.<br><br>
