            I work on a project in a non-profit organization to provide support to children with special needs in regular settings.  We purchased the camera to help develop resources for the programs in which we provide consulting and training.  The camera is very simple to use, even for staff who feel threatened by technology.  The quality of pictures is great for creating resources for preschool classrooms, for training seminars, to record and celebrate successes, and to provide parents with visual information to give them increased insight to the activities their children are participating in. We are also able to use the camera to create ID badges for staff.  As we used this camera more and more, staff from other projects within our agency became interested and have started using it.  Each project has their own flash cards and we are planning to get a flash card reader in the near future to make the camera more available. We are extremely please with this camera.<br><br>
