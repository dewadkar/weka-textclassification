            I've had my 2000 Dodge Neon for about 7 months now and I can honestly say that I'm pleased with it's overall performance. I love my Neon! I'll love it's color (DEEP AMETHYST) and I love it's roomy interior. ( I was able to fit 4 huge boxes of clothing in the backseat while I was moving.) I also have taken a particular interest in fixing this cute car up!  (Future NEON owner's beware: THIS CAR WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO &quot;SOUP IT UP&quot;!)
Basically the Neon is a cool little car. However I've had 2 minor problems so far that I'm discovering that other people have had as well.

       1) My starter makes a slight muffled grinding noise when I start
          it. This happens only once in a while. And it's also very 
          difficult to get it fixed. When I went in to get it 
          checked, the dealership was unable to find the source of  
          the problem to have it fixed until they heard the noise 
          first. Seeing as to how this problem only occurs once in a
          while for me...I'm pretty much stuck. My guess is that the
          gears in the starter aren't catching and causing that
          sound but I'm not sure.
       2) Some times when I'm driving and I press on my gas pedal my
          car seems to stall when I accelerate. Again this only occurs
          once in a while. It basically feels like the engine is 
          running properly but it's doesn't have enough fuel to power
          it. To put it in simpler terms, when I press the gas I 
          feel as if I'm not getting enough power sometimes.

Basically my main purpose in writing this comment is to find out if anyone else out there is having the same problems I am. I've put roughly 6,000 miles on my car and I don't drive like a maniac so I don't think I'm the source of the problem. Feel free to e-mail me with any solutions or comments. Or you can just post a comment on here if you wish. Thank's a Bunch!
