            So yeah, I kill my 2000 Ford Escort ZX2.  (It was kind of a relief that it died when it did, it had 38000 miles on it).  Anywho, I bought myself a Nissan Sentra GXE to replace my Escort.  BOY was this a change.  First, it's a four door compared to the 2 door of the ZX2.  The ZX2 had the Zetec engine standard, which had four more horse power than my GXE which has the standard 126 horsepower 4cylinder.  I never KNEW four horsepower would make THIS big of a difference.  Going up hills it's like you need to rock it to get it to go up with speed, but that's ok.  It has plenty of leg room for me in the drivers seat.  Many complain about the back seat - I've never sat back there so I don't know.  What I do know is that at 6'1, I fit in the front seat no problem at all!

Everyone I know who has seen the car is THOROUGHLY impressed with it - stylistically.  I got it with the luxury package, so the 15" 5 star rims were a plus on it.  Since getting it, three co workers have purchased Sentras, agreeing with me that Nissan has done itself some good from changing the Sentra of the 80's (could it BE any boxier?) to this one, the "UN-compact sedan" that many believe looks like the Maxima.  (Hell, my parents park there 2000 Nissan Maxima SE next to my Sentra every night in the garage, the cars look so much alike it's not even funny.  

The Sentra is MUCH quieter than the Escort was, has a KICK @SS STEREO (again, it's the upgraded one with the luxury package) and an all around aesthetically pleasing look.  It has a strong body.  Some @ss rear-ended me two weeks ago. His HYUNDAI was pretty smashed up, my Sentra had minimal damage in the back (well, that we could see).  

All in all, I'm *VERY* satisfied with this vehicle.  The Nissan dealership is GREAT and very helpful, compared to ANY Ford dealership.  (Don't get me started on them.)
