            We bought a 1999 Catera at the end of its model year for $29,500 (for the whole package - sticker $38,300).  The car drives very nice, the traction control system is awesome - especially after driving a SUV for six (6) years.

The engine and power train is nice and does actually give the impression, if not reality, of power, especially when you're passing on the freeway.

I've had the car up to 120 MPH on the freeway for about mile - felt fast, but not uncontrollable.

The sound system is very nice if not a little bassy.  I really enjoy the integrated radio controls and phone into the steering wheel column.

The car is loaded with those little extras (stereo system, car phone integration, Onstar System, leather seats (heated), split back seats, heated outdoor mirrors, traction control system, etc.

Following is a list of the problems that we've had with the car in the eight (8) months:

a) Stalled twice - bad gas? - I think so, no problems since
b) Airbag light on intermittantly - I haven't had it check yet...
c) Thats it!
