            I bought the base version with a 5 speed transmission in October of 2000.  So far not that many problems, but there are a lot of stuff that shouldn't go wrong in a new car so fast.  I am getting rid of it already because it has depreciated so fast and I know that I don't want to have this car for the 5 year loan that I have.  The 12.5% interest rate killed me that they offered at the dealership.

I think it is funny that I have put only 3,300 miles on my car and I could only trade this puppy in for $7,000!  I lost over $4,000 in only four months!!  I don't think that happens to Toyotas or Jeeps.  See you might pay for it upfront but when it is time to trade and you kept good care of it, you will be rewarded.

The rugs and floor mats began to bulk up and wear very fast.  The trunk liner is useless because it broke.  The dash and glovebox lights are out, drivers side automatic window down switch works when it wants to.

Overall, there is a person out there that this car might be perfect for, but not for me.  I want a car that is fun, which this car lacks, and will hold it's value and could be traded in.  I guess I should have leased another car.
