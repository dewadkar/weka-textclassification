            Why should you like the RX300?  Well, sure it's got a nice set of wheels, and that emblem will sure make the neighbors jealous.  But, there's more to it than that.  And Lexus proves this in a nice car-ute combo that's left my buns less shaken and stirred than James Bond's drink order.

When you first climb into the RX300, you're greeted with a cool, futuristic screen containing either a boat load of information (if you're in a pre-2001 edition), or a nifty navigation system.  The automatic shifter is positioned at the perfect, human-reach height, and the space provided is more than adequate for you and your mother-in-law.

The RX will also surprise you in its on-road prowess.  The engine loves to play, and never seems overworked.  It's tight, responsive and feels like a dream on the highway.

Ok, so it's roomy, fast and full of eye candy.  Is that all?  No.  When you're driving the RX, you feel like you're driving the LS.  It's plush, convenient, easy, fun and smooth all the way from Timmy's baseball game to Cindy's dance recital.  Offering heated leather seating, and an optional Nakamichi sound system, you'll also be assured to arrive in complete comfort.

The downsides?  Well, that nifty screen isn't very easy to use at first.  The buttons take some getting used to, but once you practice (and practice you will), it becomes like 2nd nature.  The other downside is the inability to drive off-road... but who does that with a car that you spent $30,000 or more on?  Neither do I.<br><br>
