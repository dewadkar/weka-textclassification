            After thoroughly researching a variety of mini-vans, my ultimate choice came down to the Honda Odyssey or Toyota Sienna.  Both vehicles are fine choices, but there were a number of things I preferred about the Sienna over the Odyssey and the other vans.

<b>The Drive</b>
The ride in the Sienna is superb.  It is smooth, soft, and comparable to some of the most luxurious cars on the road.  Cornering is typical if not better than other mini-vans.  While highway driving conceals the mini-van feel, a sharp turn reminds you that you are a bit bigger than a car.  Folks, if you want to corner like a car, buy a car.  If you must have a van, than the Sienna probably comes closest.  When people suggest that this van &quot;feels like a car&quot; they are not kidding.  To fully appreciate how awkward some of these mini-vans can feel, I suggest you test drive the winstar.  It is rickety and choppy.  After having done this, you will fully appreciate what Toyota has done with this mini-van.

The Sienna has a powerful V6 engine that really springs to life when you hit the gas.  Toyota has done their best to squash the mini-van stigma.  This vehicle has plenty of power.  The Odyssey has a bit more pep, but Sienna isn't far behind.  You will have absolutely no problem achieving highway speeds expediently in this vehicle.

<b>The Interior</b>
I highly recommend the leather seats, they really enhance the interior environment.  On the XLE, you get two rows of captains chairs.  These are fantastically comfortable, with ample leg room.  If you are loading children into car seats, you will find that the seats are at just the right level to secure a child without having to bend over at all.  The vehicle isn't as big as the Odyssey and thus has less storage space.  Some people will view this as a drawback.  I saw it as an added plus.  The interior has ample room for storage.  Additionally, you can always fold back rests down, seats forward, or totally remove individual seats for extra room.   Additionally, the slightly smaller size benefits handling.  

<b>The Exterior</b>
In my opinion, the Sienna is hands down the nicest looking van.  The Odyssey looks like a giant potato on wheels, only reinforcing the stigma attached to mini-vans.  The Sienna really is a nice looking vehicle, making people do a double take.  I have received numerous compliments on how nice the vehicle looks.  This is obviously a matter of personal taste, and not necessarily a deciding factor for many.  

<b>The Company</b>
I have always believed that the company you are buying is at least if not more important than the product.  Honda has enjoyed a positive reputation for many years.  With popularity increasing, they have become increasingly arrogant.  In fact, they are deliberately limited production of the Odyssey so as to maintain a tight grip on supply and demand.  If I had wanted to purchase an odyssey in my area, I would have had to wait 3 1/2 months!  This is not the mark of a company concerned about customer satisfaction.  Honda's arrogance extends well beyond their supply/demand fiasco.  Many consumers have expressed increasing difficulty in contacting the company, and nightmares when attempting to correct problems.  Toyota on the other hand wont wait to here from you.  Immediately after the purchase they set the tone by following up with a phone call to discuss your feelings about the purchase.  This company stands behind their vehicle.  If your the kind of person who buys Dell, even though it costs a bit more up front to get the service, than Toyota is your company.  Honda will throw a pretty good van your way, but good luck if something goes wrong.

<b>Must Have Features</b>
I have already mentioned the leather seating.  If you have children, definitely get the optional electric sliding door.  This feature is utterly amazing!  My only complaint is that they should offer it on both sliding doors.  If you are not getting the XLE, I highly recommend keyless entry.  Another tiny feature that makes life so much easier.

If you are a music buff, definitely opt for the 6 speaker stereo.  While the integration of radio controls with the steering wheel is impressive, the sound system is still sub par.  Adding the fancier system helps, but Toyota's biggest boo boo is clearly not offering a premier sound system.  There are no equalizers or even preset sound schemes, and no way to fade.  Additionally, the sound is somewhat raspy.  You might consider the cheaper radio system, with the intention of ripping it out and putting your own in.  Really not a bad idea.  If your like me, your gonna be spending long hours in the van with screaming kids behind you.  A nice system would be a nice way to temper the havoc of the family environment.

If your considering the Sienna, you probably have a little bit more money to spend on a van.  My advice would be to go with the XLE.  Nothing is worse than the feeling of spending a lot of money and feeling a little short changed.  For a little bit more, you get their flagship van.

<b>Pricing</b>
Ignore sticker price with Toyota, it is mere bait and switch.  Before you have all of 'your stuff' added to it, the price will inflate several thousand, typically 27-30,000,000.  The Odyssey price is for a relatively loaded vehicle, making it a bit more economical.  But what is a solid brand worth.  Honda is hoping you will continue to be disillusioned by their reputation of old.  My advice, spend a little bit more and get not only a solid vehicle, but also a strong company.    

<b>Overall</b>
Both the Sienna and Odyssey are fine vehicles.  Sienna is more attractive with a solid company standing behind their vehicle.  Honda is arrogant, and artificially increases demand by limiting manufacturing.  This is outrageous, and should be a stern signal that something is awry at Honda.  This is an expensive investment, and if the company has that kind of contempt for the consumer, the consumer should avoid them.
