            My husband and I purchased our Mercury Sable over a year ago. It is a 1996 and has been very reliable. The reason we purchased this car is because my trusty ford just did not have enough pick up. The engine in the Mercury Sable is very nice. I dont get run off the road when I'm trying to merge onto the freeway.

I like the style of this car. That is what drew me to it. It has great features inside and looks nice outside. I do however wish it had more room. Its a pain to get my 2 year old in and out of her car seat. I've bumped my head plenty of times getting out. The trunk space is not so great also. 

I enjoy the smooth quiet drive in my Mercury Sable. It is a 1996 model and we have had to bring it in to the shop one time since we've gotten it. If you take care of this car and do the regular yearly work it will be around a while. I enjoy the comfort of this car. I drive a 3 hour drive to visit my sister and mother in law quite often and I enjoy the ride. I would recomend this car mostly to teens. I would trust my teen to be safe in this car and it is roomy enough to pack in some friends. I do however think it would not be recomended to parents with younge kids in car seats. It would be easier to have a sport utility car.<br><br>
