            Sony�s cyber-shot DSC-F55 is my second digital camera and I am really enthusiastic about this product. The picture are always in focus, the battery lasts at least for one hour, the download to your computer is with help of a PCMCI card very quick and �most important- this camera is small and light. You can carry it anywhere you want. And the camera is also very robust. I am not using any case or box for more than sic months now and had no problems.
Through the pivoting lens (Carl Zeiss!!! really good) you can make picture without holding this device in front of your face. So often nobody even realizes that you are taking picture. 
The chip is very light sensitive, so that you don�t have to use a flash in rooms, only if it is really very dark.
I also like the feature of taking short (up to 15 sec) MPEG4 movies. Often you don�t need longer shots and the results are a lot of fun, even though they have only a small resolution (320*240).
Two little disadvantages: it takes some time to start the camera. I hate this, especially if I want to make a snap shot. The flash is too bright. If I shoot a portrait in a dark room and I want to use the flash, the result is basically a white area on the picture.
Of course I also have to mention the advantages of taking digital pictures: no film, no additional costs, easy to erase, quick in the computer to manipulate. And the resolution is really good: I havent had the feeling that I missed an important detail. But of course we all want more!
