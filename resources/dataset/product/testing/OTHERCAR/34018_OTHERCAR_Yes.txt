            If you're looking for dozens of image, flash, zoom, and exposure settings, in a small package, you've got the right camera. The Canon Powershot S30 camera is clearly not a camera intended for photography professionals who want to take hundreds of pictures at different resolutions, want to play with the lighting and other effects, as well as have the ability to zoom into the object many times over. However, it is a complete package. The S30 offers features found in much larger cameras at twice the price for half the price at a much smaller size. The S30 is a compact camera, widely acknowledged as the best bang-for-your-buck camera in its size on the market.

The S30 is virtually identical to its cousin the S40, with several minor differences. The S40 shoots at a slightly higher resolution, has one additional shooting mode, and is 4 megapixels as opposed to the S30's 3.2. However, the S40 is commonly found for over $150 more, and these features, in my opinion, are not worth the investment. The S30 shoots images at the maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels, at a 3.2 Megapixel resolution. Similar cameras of similar sizes offered by competitors top off at around 2.1 Megapixels, without paying premium prices.

The S30 offers thirteen different shooting modes, all of which can take advantage of its 3X optical or 10x digital zoom from the automatic, where the ISO speed, flash, and shutter speeds are calculated by the camera, to the movie mode, which can record up to 30 seconds of full-audio AVI film at 320x160 resolution, and approximately 20 frames per second. Other modes include portrait, speed, and slow modes. These can be used to shoot pictures of objects up close, where the foreground recieves more exposure than the background, as well as to capture objects, whether fast or slow, in motion with little blur (fast/slow shooting modes). The camera also allows you, with additional settings, to set the shutter speed, ISO settings (up to 800) and lighting setting with a touch of a button.

The S30 accepts both Type 1 and Type 2 compactflash cards, including the IBM microdrive, which comes in sizes up to 1 GB - more than enough space to store approximately 600 pictures, shot at the maximum quality and size on the S30. Because of the camera's size, it might be expected that the battery, card, and all other "removable" parts would be hard to access and would require large fingernails. However, Canon has made a small slot on the bottom with several spring mechanisms which allow easy access for the card (when ejected) as well as the battery.

The LCD is brilliant, and captures much of the color in the viewfinder. Upon moving the pictures to my computer, I found that they looked virtually identical in thumbnail form as they did at their maximum resolution. You can also set the LCD to turn off or on, in order to conserve battery power.

Right out of the box, the camera is very easy to use. The on/off switch is built right into the lens cover, so simply popping in the rechargable battery and flash card and sliding open the lens cover allows for virtually instantaneous use. The "AUTO" mode allows for simple point-and-shoot use, with the camera selecting the right settings, auto-focusing, and taking the picture with a fake shutter "click" sound. (Installing custom software allows you to customize this shutter sound to a soundbyte of your own creation or choosing). Once the pictures have been taken, the camera also can be connected directly to certain Canon printers to print images directly out of the camera.

The camera does have some weaknesses, however. Because of its size, the flash is rather weak, and is quite sensitive if your hand is accidentally cupped over part of it - the image exposure will increase in the top left hand corner. Also, the control pad is sometimes difficult to operate as some operations require that you push it in. I found myself several times pushing the left or right accidentally as I tried to depress the button evenly to produce the desired result. Also, the S30 is a battery hog. An extra battery is a requirement for this camera, as its batteries rarely last over 70 pictures - although I have heard otherwise. 

All in all, the S30 is an excellent camera with many benefits that far outweigh its negative points. With the ability of both the novice and the professional to take advantage of its 3x optical zoom, manual or autofocus, and its 13 different shooting modes, the S30 is a camera for everybody...at an affordable price.
