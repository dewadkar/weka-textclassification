            I recently purchased a used (29,000 miles) 1998 Mercury Tracer GS 4-door sedan, and the great thing is...it's my first car!!  Being a six-foot tall, 180 lbs eighteen-year-old, this small economy car (yet roomy) was a Godsend.  I was looking in the market for a mid-size, yet roomy car that I could easily move around in, fit in the driver's seat (where my knees don't touch the steering wheel or where my head didn't hit the roof), and fit in the rest of the car.  I found that in the GS model. Its roomy driver's seat allows for me to fit comfortably while the bucket seats provide the utmost comfort for me (can you tell I'm a college student?).  What's more, I fit in the back seat directly behind the driver seat even when the seat's in the configuration I have it in...pushed all the way back.  The fold-down back seats allow for more trunk space, even though the trunk is big enough to fit me comfortably (I tested it).  The SRS standard driver and passenger side airbags allow for peace of mind on my part, and the stereo is very good for a mid-size sedan.  It runs great, and is almost quiet.  It does have a great pickup on the engine, runs smoothly, has power steering, AC, and other cool stuff.  For my first and only car, I love this little thing.
The drive on this vehicle is like riding on air...you almost forget you're driving a car (which is kind of difficult to do on Southern California's streets).  It's one of those cars that I would call &quot;small, but big&quot; because it's a compact car, but it's huge on the inside.  The powerful engine does this car a lot of justice.  I recommend this car for anyone who's just learning to drive, wants a small economic car, or just wants a fun car to drive...
Go out and get a Tracer GS. You won't be sorry.  That's my two cents.<br><br>
