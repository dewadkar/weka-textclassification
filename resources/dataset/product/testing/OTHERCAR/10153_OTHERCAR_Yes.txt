            I purchased a 1999 1/2 Pathfinder last December. We decided on the Pathfinder for the style - we bought the SE limited which included pretty much everything the LE did except the new climate control.  We were looking a the Pathfinder and the 4-Runner. We found the Pathfinder to be a much better ride, and bonus - cheaper!  We paid $29K for the vehicle. For a similar 4-runner we probably would have been talking $34-38K.

One other advantage to the Pathfinder is the maintenance - it is virtually maintenance free up to about 65K miles.  The engine is quite quiet, so quiet in fact that I have a bad habit of starting it after it is already on! So far so good, only complaint which is not specific to this SUV is the gas mileage. I've driven a Jetta for 10 years and really underestimated how often we would have to fill up!<br><br>
