            So happy with my lovely MINI COOPER.  I really liked my Land Rover, but the maintenance and the gas costs were just getting out of hand.  The look of the MINI had really caught my eye, I love British cars and the history of the MINIs is fascinating.  When I first wrote my review I'd only had it for a month or so.  I've now been driving the MINI for about 3 months and and have much better insight and comments.  I should also mention, I'm not too mechanically inclined, but I'm learning.

- Learned how to drive a stick shift on my new MINI and it's great.  Had it down in a week and I won't drive an automatic again.  From my learning I've also noticed that the shift is really easy compared to other cars - a wide throat I think it's called...

- FUEL EFFICIENT.  I really love getting 30mpg,  especially after an SUV with 10mpg.  It will take a while if you have the onboard computer to see the Ave Consumption go up, I'm reading it at about 29.7 all the time now, but I'm assuming it's because I do a significant combo of city and highway - my guess-timate is that I'm running 27 city (loads of stop and go) and hopefully 34 highway.  From the research I've done it looks like it takes a while to build up the efficiency, but I'm pleased either way.

- SHOWSTOPPER AND CONVERSATION MAKER!!  Really love the attention I get in my MINI.  Loads of looks, tons of people asking about it and plenty of great conversation.  I live in Milwaukee and during the Harley Anniversary I got tons of praise for my "cool ride" and loads of questions from riders (mostly male) about the car and how it handled.  No matter where, people's curiosity is piqued by this car and they all seem to know a bit about the history and plenty more about the mechanics than I do.  Can't be a shy person with this car! 

- Comfortable, I've been around with 2 people in the back and it's worked out fine.  They had enough room because the front leg room allows you to pull up your seat for them.  I had a 6'4" guy sit in the front and he loved that he had plenty of headroom, and was able to stretch his legs out in front of him!

- Agile.  This car is ideal for the city.  It's quick, very responsive and can fit in unbelievable spots.  The longer that I have this car, the more pleased.  I go to Chicago very often and this is a dream when you want to find some street parking.  I can squeeze into spots between greedy parking SUVS!

The only downsides are...
- It is small - so you can't really take loads of stuff around.  Which should be expected.
- The ride can be choppy or racy feeling.  Which is fine if you're prepared for that.  


Overall it's an excellent choice!  Hope you enjoy.

(I'll update my review in a few more months.  Probably after I experience driving in Wisconsin snow!)
