            I have '96 Tahoe which is a lease but we are planning to purchase when that runs out (in July).  And I just absolutely love this vehicle!  It's been extremely reliable ::knock on wood::: and we have not had any major problems with the vehicle at all.  Yes, we've put in some money, put I honestly don't think it's been more than $800 (excluding oil changes) and some of that is your 60,000 mile check ups where the tires are rotated, etc.  Not bad for a truck that has almost 80,000 miles on it now.  
We originally leased the vehicle because we had a yellow lab puppy that was growing up and out of my tiny sports car and we planned to travel with her alot! I know, a big investment for a dog! LOL! But we also knew that the time wasn't too far off when we would start a family also.  So far, it's worked out great for long trips with the dog and our daughter! Fits all the things you need to travel w/kids for long weekends, etc. (you know, the portacribs, the toys, etc.!)and the dog still has room to ride comfortably!
I love the way this vehicle rides, also.  To me, it's right up there with some luxury cars! The ride for the most part is smooth and does not have a 'truck feel' to it at all.  
I think the only complaint I have about it is that the back windows (on the 'barn door' style, do not open at all.  I remember with the old Suburbans, you could pop the back window so the bottom would be open a bit (of course having the dog back there made me think of this feature!).  It would also be nice to have some climate controls in the back seat.  The front passengers sometimes need to freeze/boil in order for the backseat passengers to get comfortable.  Oh, and also..the placement of the cup holders, they are right in front of the vents, so if it's winter and you have the heat on, there goes you cold cola or in the summer, no more hot coffee! 
Some of the features I love are the compartment for your sunglasses and the car garage remote (even though I don't have one!). Also the 2 extra lighter plugs so I don't have to take out your lighter in order to use a cell phone or radar detector.
Over all...I just love my Tahoe and you'd have a hard time convincing me to give it up...except for a brand new one maybe!<br><br>
