             One of the most comfortable luxury cars on the road and it is American made to boot. Considering the engine size it delivers great gas mileage on trips. I have gotten about 30+ MPH on highways and 24 MPH around town. Roomy and beautifully appointed interior makes it a pleasure to ride in, and  it is built to last with a great body shape. This is one sporty looking car with out losing the Cadillac appeal. There is also very few repairs needed because of the quality built in. BUT, when any repairs are necessary you had better have a good savings set aside to cover them.
Accessory wise there is NOTHING left off of this model, it has it all.<br><br>
