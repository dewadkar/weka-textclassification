            I have been a fan of digital cameras since I first seen them appear on the market. I immediately ran out and bought the then $300 Casio QV-11. The quality wasn't great but I was so impressed by digital photography that I didn't mind. When our tax returns came in this year I decided it was time to upgrade my little image maker. I searched high and low for what I thought would be my best option and I ended up picking the <b>Sony Mavica MVC-CD1000</b>. 

I don't remember which was more important to me at the time; the high 10x optical and 20x digital zoom or the fact that it stores images on CD-R discs. I've always admired the <b>Mavica</b> line for storage reasons. The earlier Mavicas used 3.5" floppy disks. The newer <b>CD1000</b> uses pretty much the same idea but with mini CD-R discs resulting in more space to keep those precious memories. 

The CD-R discs themselves range from $4-$5 a piece and can be found at Circuit City or similar stores. They're smaller then general CD-R's and say "Mavica" on the case. Each CD-R holds about 160 decent sized pictures, in my experience. I'm not certain on how the numbers vary with the different screen resolutions you can choose from. 

When you insert the disc you have to initialize it, and you have to finalize it when you are done using it in order to make it viewable in computers that do not have CD-R technology. Both of my home PC's have CD-R drives so I don't finalize mine. The finalization takes up more of that precious disc space that I treasure, though if I were to share the disc with family it would need to be finalized for them to view it on their PC's. 

The <b>CD1000</b> not only takes excellent still pictures, but it also gives you the option of making little mini movies in MPEG format. They're only a few seconds in length but they're decent quality and they're complete with sound. I've made some cute ones of the kids to stick up on their webpages. This feauture is GREAT if you have relatives out of the area who would like to watch your family grow. 

The <b>CD1000</b> has a nice 2.5" LCD screen on which you can preview your photos, use as an alternative to the viewfinder, and watch your movies. 

The pop-up flash is supposed to help eliminate red eyes in pictures and it's worked pretty well for us thus far. I've only had a couple instances of red eye, and I think a lot of it had to do with the given lighting at the time of the photo. 

One of my favorite features is the black and white and sepia effects. My husband likes the negative art and solarize effects. It gives you an option aside from your average every day photos. Add on some more special effects for improved picture quality and you can take some pretty nifty images. 

Battery life is average. My fully charged camera lasts me about an hour with LCD screen on and flash in use about half of the time. Not too bad, but not really good either. This is where I think it'd be handy to have an ac adapter so you're not left without battery power when you most needed it. 

My biggest complaint with the <b>CD1000</b> is that it is HUGE. I hang it around my neck with the strap it came with but it takes both hands to manuever and it can become very heavy after a long period of time. It resembles a conventional camcorder, not anything like the sleek compact digital cameras on the market today. 

I personally wouldn't use anything else. It's not for everyone and it does take some getting used to. I wouldn't recommend it to beginners. I have had it since March of 2001 and I am still getting used to a lot of the features.
