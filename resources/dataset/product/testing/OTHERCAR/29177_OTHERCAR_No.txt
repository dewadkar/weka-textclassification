            I bought a 1999 neon a year ago.  I thought that it would make a good little car for me,but I have made trip after trip to the shop with this car.

I bought this car because I wanted to prove to my family that I was responsible enough to make the payment and it was a way for me to start my credit.

I have only had this car for thirteen months and already it has been to the shop more than my 1989 pontiac sunbird did.  The only problem I had with my sunbird was the timing chain broke,I only had this car in the shop once.

Lately I have had problems that no one could really avoid,my car has been involved in two hit and runs,which I couldn't avoid.  My car was parked and I wasn't in the vehicle either time.

In the past week my car has been to the shop twice and today while I was driving it I noticed that the work they had done did not fix the problem.

After my car got hit the second time in the front,I noticed a noise in my transmission.  I took it to get looked at and they found nothing.  The mechanic told me that the guard that protects my muffler was bent so they fixed it,the next day I noticed a thumping noise like they had forgot to put bolts back in my car or something,the noise came from under where my console is in my car.  They had me bring my car back in and I sat at the shop for over two hours.  They told me that my muffler was hitting my floorboard.  They bent the muffler so that it would make the noise anymore.  Well here it is three days later and the muffler is hitting my floorboards again and there is another noise under my car,when this noise happens I start to loose power in my car,it is worse when I am going up a hill.  It seems like there is hesitation when I try to give it more gas to get up the hill.

So tomorrow morning I have to call the mechanic for a third time,which is something that I am not pleased about in any means.

A brand new car should not be having this many problems and this many visits to the shop in one week.

For the money that I am paying for this car you would think that it would be problem free for at least two years,it should only need to go to the shop maybe once or twice a year besides the regular tune-ups. <br><br>
