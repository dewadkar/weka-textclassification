            I ought this vehicle due to the high performance that the company usually lies about.  This vehicle was a pretty nice thing til I started to have many problems out of it the very week that I had it.  Sometimes the company tells you certain things about the vehicle to make it seem like it will last you forever.  Then, you start having troubles out of it when you get it.
I hate this vehicle because the paint job starts to fade away.  The paint job on these cars may last you two years at the most if you take care of them.  On the other hand, these cars have been known by mechanics to have the worst way of breaking down due to the engine and the transmission.  Most of the time you have to allow others to know the truth before you buy a vehicle.
Driving the camaro was pretty difficult in my part due to the loose front end and rear end.  There really isn't enough weight in the rear to help keep the rear end from sliding around on you when you drive it in the rain or on dry roads.  I wouldn't prefer driving in the rain due to the tires breaking loose on you due to the water on the roads.
I feel that no one should buy this vehicle because it isn't worth the money that you pay for it.  There are other ups and downs in this vehicles performance due to the torque of the engine for no heavier car than it is.  The camaro wouldn't be to great to have because if you get it dirty then you will have a hard time getting it clean in the future.  The wind shields also shatter pretty easy in the winter and in the summer time due to the thin windows.  Should anyone have the camaro?  no one will ever know! <br><br>
