                After our family fell madly in love with our first Saturn, which we had purchased only the year before, we decided to buy another Saturn. After all, we hadn't had any major problems with our first Saturn, and the price was sure right! We decided on a Saturn SL2 with all the options. 
    The plush leather interior and leather wrapped steering wheel made our Saturn feel like we were driving a luxury car. The car looks and feels more expensive then the purchase price.
    After about a year of blissful driving, we started experiencing problems with our sunroof. The sunroof leaked when it rained, leaving unsightly salt rings on our ceiling. After taking the car back to the dealer multiple times, the problem still hasn't been fixed. 
    Our Saturn had been in multiple accidents. One time I was broad-sided in my Saturn and the other time, the driver smashed into the front passenger side wheel. I came out of these accidents unscathed. The car on the other hand was less fortunate. Our Saturn has driven us on many family vacations, and had helped me commute over 150 miles a week. 
    Our Saturn gets good gass mileage, and has a very comfortable ride. The saftey features have saved my life on more than one occasion, and the car itself is just so cute!  Everything about my Saturn would want me to buy yet another Saturn...we already have twin Saturns....why not triplets!<br><br>
