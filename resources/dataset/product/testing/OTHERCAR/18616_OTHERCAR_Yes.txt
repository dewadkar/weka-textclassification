            My wife traded her plain, boring '95 4-cylinder Accord for a peppy, 6-cylinder, loaded Alero.  And I'm proud to say that it was all my idea!

The Alero is a very sharp, very fast sports-sedan which I would put up against any import.  The handling is great, although with the optional sport suspension that we have, rough roads are tough to take.  Sometimes, with enough potholes, you can skip all over the place.  However, any other time, the handling is first-rate.

Also, for being a GM product, the fit and finish is comparable to most imports.  Some small details, like a plastic strip between the windshield and the dash, are not engineered the greatest, but things like that are overlooked easily considering the roomy interior and superb engine.

We both would definitely recommend an Alero to anyone purchasing a new, mid-sized vehicle.  And with the 6-cylinder, it is a sports car for the young family!<br><br>
