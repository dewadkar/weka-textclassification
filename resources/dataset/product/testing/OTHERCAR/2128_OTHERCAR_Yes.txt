            I picked out this car in Jan.'93. It's a Hunter Green 4Dr V6 Sedan. When I picked it out it had 8 miles on it, now it has almost 84,000 and going on 7 years old. It has been driven all over Hawaii, then shipped to CA. and in 4 years time has made a cross-country trip to S.C. where it was then shipped to Italy and trucked to Germany.We were in HI. at the time when we bought it and we didn't have very good credit and it was financed in MO. and it took a month to get approved,so after we were able to take the car home we nicknamed it 'Shamrock', cause of how lucky we were to get it. We paid it off the end of Sept'99(We refinanced it), that's why it took us so long to pay it off. 
Anyway, the car has a lot of orginal parts, and just recently we had to buy new rear shocks to replace the orginals. No major problems have happened yet, I think it's nicknames sake has made it a pretty blessed car.
I would recommend this car, or this model, it is VERY relible. P.S. Being in Germany we've really put 'Shamrock' to the test, you can imagine. The V6 which we own(I will never buy a V4, that's another story) you can be going 100 MPH and the car runs SO quietly and smooth, I don't like to push it past that cause I don't like driving that fast, also when we did get it up to 120 MPH(On the Autobahn), it started shuttering, so I whouldn't recommend going over a 100. I LOVE the car, get it if you find one, if the previous owner took car of it, it'll take good care of you.:-)<br><br>
