            My husband and I just bought a new house, and low and behold my car died just a few weeks after moving in.  So we needed to get another car.  We looked around for a while at new and used cars.  We found that the Elantra was a really good buy.  A lot of the standards that came with the car were options on other new cars, and used cars had a lot of miles or the price was almost the same as the Elantra.  I have had my car for over a year now and it still runs as good as the day that I got it.  A couple of months ago my husband had got in a accident with the car, and he told me that he actually felt safe in it, and the car geld up pretty good in the accident.  I had it repaired at a Hyundai body shop and the car looked as good as new.  I admit it took over a week to get it fixed because they had to order parts, but they did a great job on it.  I like this car a lot, and face it you can't beat the warranty it comes with.  And I'm not a tall person so it's the right size for me, wouldn't recommend the car for someone really tall.
