            I recently found myself in need of a new car.  Always having driven used cars, I found myself, needless to say, in &quot;sticker shock&quot; after looking at new vehicles.  I limited my looking and test-driving to just a few models.  The Saturn was my first choice as I left home, having done a little research on quality and dependability.  After driving the Saturn, and dealing with the salesman, I was further convinced that the Saturn was for me.  My second choice, after driving and looking, was the Cougar.  Similar in body type and options, I found the Saturn to be more comfortable from a driving standpoint and of course the price was more to my liking.  I have now had the car for about 9 months and have been more than pleased with the performance, style, comfort and dependability of my Saturn SC-2.  <br><br>
