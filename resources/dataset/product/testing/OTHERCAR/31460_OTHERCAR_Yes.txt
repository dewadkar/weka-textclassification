               I shopped around quite abit before purchasing the HP 318.  I wanted a camera that would produce quality pictures, but being new to the digital camera scene, I didn't want to pay $400.
   The 318 has all the features you need to produce good digital pictures. 

Built in flash: auto, flash on, flash off, and red eye control

3 Quality levels:  Good    592 by 400 resolution
                   Better  1792 by 1200 resolution
                            (medium compression)
                   Best    1792 by 1200 resolution
                             (low compression)

The best setting by far produces the best pictures for printing, but you can only store 7 images at a time without a memory card.  You can store 16 images in the better mode and 113 in the good mode. 

Timer:  You have 10 seconds to jump into the picture

Auto focus:  automatically adjust the exposure for current lighting when you hold the shutter halfway down.  If camera cannot find focus a yellow light appears to warn you.

1.8 inch color LCD display:  you can view thumbnails of your stored pictures, magnify your images, or just view the picture.

Downloading the software is a snap and uploading pictures to the computer goes very quickly.  I leave my connection plugged into my computer so I can upload easily.  Works with Windows or MacIntosh.

Other Camera Specifications:  
 color depth 30 bit
 8MB internal memory
 5 element lens; F2.8;  TTL auto focus; 6.8mm(equal to 43mm
                          lens on conventional 35mm camera

  This is an attractive camera.  Comes with wrist strap for carrying, buttons are self explanatory.  I took my first pictures before I read the manual.  Small size fits easily in a purse or shirt pocket.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone starting out in digital photography.
