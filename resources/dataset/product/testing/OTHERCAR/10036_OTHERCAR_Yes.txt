            I bought a 2000 kia sephia a little less than a week ago, and although i realise that i haven't had her for very long, i wanted to put my two cents in.
The people at the dealership were marvelous, they let me test drive so many times and nver gave me any trouble, they were helpful and even cut me a good deal. The first thing i did was go for a road trip, she did great. My boyfriend was amazed by the legroom and head room (he's a tall one) and couldn't stop talking about how comfortable it is. I don't get  sore after driving for several hours (which has been a problem for me in smaller cars in the past), she corners marvelously, accelerates ans shifts smoothly and looks fantastic. I feel like for the price i paid i got a great car! Recommended for first time car buyers and college students, as well as for small families (less than 5 in total) who want a cute way to get there.
