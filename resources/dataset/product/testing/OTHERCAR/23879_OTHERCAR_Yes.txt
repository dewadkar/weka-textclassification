            I bought a blue 1995 Mazda Millenia in 1998 for about $16,000.  I traded in my horrible 1999 Ford Ranger 4x4 that I had driven for less than two months.  I shouldn't have test driven this car at night.  It looked absolutely gorgeous in the dusk.  The test drive was awesome - I loved the heated leather seats and the feel of sophisticated power.  Although this wasn't the S (which is really what I wanted) - it was good enough for me to go ahead and purchase it.  I couldn't believe how much I was getting for so little...  very comfortable leather seats, power moon roof, 6 disc CD Changer and power everything.  The tilt steering wheel comes with a cool memory feature - set it to the memory position and when you turn off the car, the tilt wheel elevates out of your way.  Turn the car on and the wheel returns to the previous position.

I came back the next day and discovered that the chrome trim on the wheels was peeling - that's why you should never test drive a car after dark...  Other than that, it looked in pretty decent shape.  I have since driven this car for about a year and have had zero problems with it.  It now has over 70,000 miles on the engine.  It is my favorite luxury car.

The only problem I have with it is the overpriced replacement parts...  I think that is a problem with most luxury cars, but it would be nice if Mazda could be a little more kind to us.  A replacement headlight costs around $500...  After getting quoted about $400 per wheel to replace the damaged ones, I went to Discount Tire and purchased four Mongoose wheels for about $700.  Now the car looks nigh perfect...

I hope more people will buy the Mazda Millenia - it is definitely a car that is well worth the money (even new).  At lease try it out before shelling out the big bucks to Lexus (Toyota), Infiniti (Nissan) or Mercedes Benz...<br><br>
