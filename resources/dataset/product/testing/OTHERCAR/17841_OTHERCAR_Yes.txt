            My girlfriend and I decided to rent a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer to take up north with us.  We didn't want to take our compact cars on a long trip.  We rented the LS 4 door model with four-wheel drive.  I was afraid at first to drive a sport utility but after sliding into the comfortable seat, it felt like the truck was built around me.  Every option from the overhead console to the CD player was within a good reach.  I was amazed that an SUV could be so &quot;off-road&quot; but &quot;luxury&quot; at the same time.  

Upon starting the Blazer, you are easily able to point out the powerful V-6 under the hood.  Driving the Blazer was like a dream.  I coasted over every bump as if it were not even there.  For instance, I had taken the Blazer home before we left.  I live on a dead-end dirt road that is very bumpy.  I felt very little &quot;shaking&quot; when driving down the road.  The four-wheel drive also impressed me.  Upon driving down my road, I had turned the four-wheel drive on and I instantly felt the system kick in.  

The inside was very quiet for the ride without wind noise or rattling.  I also like the exterior looks of it.  I had received comments about how nice it looked.  One lady went as far as to walk up and look inside.  The only real complaint I have about the vehicle was the amount of gas we went through.  This is true for any sport utility but the gas mileage is poor.  

All and all, if you are a teenager who wants to cart friends around to the movies, parties, and so on, this truck would not be for you.  It lacks good gas mileage and has little room in the back. But if you are looking for another family vehicle, the Blazer would be a good choice.  I feel it delivers more power and looks than the common minivan.<br><br>
