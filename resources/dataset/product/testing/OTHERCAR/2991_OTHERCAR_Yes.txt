            I love my Jeep Wrangler, it is my pride and joy.  I have spent a lot of money on it so far and this is mostly my fault for being uneducated about what is a good price on this type vehicle.  I bought my Jeep for $10,500 and it was completely stock.  I later found out that this was a few thousand dollars too much.  If you are looking for a '94 or under Jeep you shouldn't pay this much.  After a couple of months i decided to put a lift on it and some 33x12.50 tires.  If you want a lift on your jeep, just spend the $500 or so on a suspension lift.  I tried to save money by using the stock parts and flipping the springs to attain a 5 inch lift.  This may seem like a cheap way to do it but in the long run it is much cheaper to just but a lift kit.  You will be much happier with a big lifted Jeep than with a stock one with little tires.  Talk to somebody knowledgeable who doesn't work for a specialty car shop and they will charge you a lot less than a shop that will charge you up to $1000 to put the lift on.<br><br>
