            The dodge ram is by far the best looking truck on the road.  The fender flares which can be added make this truck look even bigger than it really is.  This truck is extremely comfortable and is a good work horse but Dodge cannot make a transmission if its life depended on it.  This truck will need constant visits to the shop based on this fact.  If not for this problem the ram would be at the top of my wish list but sorry dodge...take after the Japs and make a good transmission.<br><br>
