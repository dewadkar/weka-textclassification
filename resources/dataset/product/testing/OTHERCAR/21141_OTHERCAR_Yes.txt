            Last summer I was thoroughly researching a camera to get myself as a graduation gift, and now, a year later I would still buy the same camera today.   Why?  The first thing that caught my eye was that it caught my eye.  Boy, is it pretty.  I had seen the earlier model, the F505, at Circuit city and thought that if they changed just a few things like a higher resolution CCD it would be perfect.  In the second generation, they fixed it up nicely and I pre-ordered it right away.


In a year of use I have come to love its viewfinderless design w/reflective TFT screen(as surprise to a SLR user), rotating lens (great for elevated shots, better than the Nikon's), <b>macro focusing</b>, and all-around great lens.  The picture quality is pretty good, though I rarely use its full psuedo-3.3MP, or its uncompressed modes.  The zoom lens is smooth.  

Using many of the Sony models, I have come to appreciate the polish they put into their cameras.  It never feels chinsy.  Their memory stick, while proprietary, is neato.  It clicks in and out, just like the infolithium battery, and is fast enough.  They make 128MB sticks as of now, I like it better than CompactFlash, and it is hard to fill that up in just one outing (no real need for me for a microdrive).  The manual focus on this thing just works in a fun way, like this whole camera.

I found to make this camera really worth it you need some accessories though.  An extra battery, memory stick 64MB at least, and case (Sony's is neat) are mandatory by my book.  Despite that, I just love this camera!
