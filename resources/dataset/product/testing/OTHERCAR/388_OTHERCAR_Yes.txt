            I recently bought a black 4-door 2000 Nissan XTerra SE w/ 2WD, and I love it!  It looks great and provides a smooth, safe, and fun ride.  My model, being an SE, has many features, including an AM/FM/CD/Cassette audio system w/  6 speakers, a skyroof, 15-inch alloy wheels, roof rack w/ gear basket, step rails, fog lights, rear window de-fogger, 12-volt power outlets, first aid kit, power everything, remote keyless entry, security system, automatic transmission, cruise control, map lights, digital clock, 4 cupholders, floor mats, water-resistant seat covers, and lots more!  
I would say the XTerra is a great off-road vehicle with a lot of luxurious features.  Also, the price is unbelievable!  Most sport-utility vehicles cost over $30,000, where the XTerra costs anywhere between $22,000 and $26,000.  What makes it such a great off-road vehicle is the fact that it's built very similar to a truck.  In fact, the base IS a truck.  
This new Nissan SUV was introduced just this year, and I have seen so many of them on the roads, especially in Panama City Beach, Florida.  Obviously, people are beginning to realize what a great car this is and that they need to go out and buy one for their next vehicle purchase.  So, I recommend for everyone to go out and buy an XTerra today!  <br><br>
