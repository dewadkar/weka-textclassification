            I recently purchased a SAAB 900 after changing my job and needing a car. 

The car is great for the motorways and for trunk roads, making long journeys seem short. It is also very quiet at high speeds. 

One of the great features of this car, is the black panel display, allowing you to switch off all dashboard illumination and just watch the runway. The cockpit of the car really does feel like an airplane cockpit. 

The engine has astounded me, as it can really rev high, with over 5000 revs/ minute, if you so desire. This means, you can accelerate very fast in this car which can be useful for getting out of tricky situations. 

The car came with built in CD player and the sound system is great. 

Some parts on the car are GM parts, when I looked under the bonnet. This is an advantage, as GM garages can service the car avoiding the expensive SAAB garage. The previous owner got his car serviced at an Alfa garage. The car comes with alloy wheels, which look great in summer. In winter, I put winter tires on the car. 

The car has excellent ABS brakes, with really good braking. Other safety features include 2 airbags, sturdy frame, elevated drivers seat for good visibility, keys placed next to hand brake, fog lights, good acceleration...
I still have not figured how to full fold down the back seats, but it is possible.  The seats are very securely attached with a lateral steel bar.  Shows again, that SAAB designed the car with safety in mind.  

If you are planning to buy a SAAB, check out the 2.3 liter turbo model, as I feel the 2.0 Coupe lacks the power of its big brother. 

The car consumed 11 litres / 100 K when I first got it, but, since I learned to drive it correctly, it only consumes 10.5 l/100k.  

This car is intelligent.  It checks your brakes every time you turn it on, it tells you to put your seatbelt on, it advises you when its time for a service.  Wow..I am impressed. 

Another great feature of this car, is the heating.  It really heats up well.  Feels like a sauna.  Just what you need for those cold winter days..  Also has aircon, for the summer.

I feel I got a lot of car for my money. I am already planning to purchase my next SAAB.
