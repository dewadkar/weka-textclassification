            I have always wanted a Maxima ever since I got my license.  So as soon as I could I bought a new one.  I thought it was going to be a great experience.  It has been everything but that.  Let me list all of the things that have gone wrong with the car and how many times it has takes to get fixed.

1)  The day I got the car the CD player broke.  Two trips to the dealer.

2)  A rubber bumper from the trunk lid was missing.  This would cause the trunk to rattle while driving which ultimately caused the paint on both the trunk lid and the body to chip away.  After 7 trips to two different dealers the missing piece was finally replaced and the paint was touched up.  Now the areas are rusting.

3)  My AC fan started making a REALLY annoying clicking sound.  3 trips to the dealer for this.

4)  My head-liner started to fall near the sunroof.  Two trips.

5)  Rear sub-woofer is makes some awful noise (rattling)whenever I try to turn the base up above the middle mark.  Three trips and a new sub-woofer later it's still doing it.

6)  After 30k miles the leather on the driver's seat cracked away (a pretty big patch of it too).  I treat my seat with leather conditioner every other month.  Two trips to the dealer and its now been two months the seat has been on back-order.

7)  The paint.  I got the white.  Whatever you do...don't get the white.  It really comes off the car easily (chips EVERYWHERE).  And to make it better...the touch up paint the dealer gave me is not the right color (it looks more like a silver).  If for some reason you do get the white...DON'T use their touch up paint.  Take it to a body shop and spend the $50.

8)  The car is currently at the dealer for engine problems.  The car is intermittently stalling and misfiring and the check engine light is on.

***Got the car back...apparently the ECU connector came loose.  Fixed at no charge.

***Two days later the problem started happening again.  Guess they didn't fix it and the loose connector was their way of saying "we don't have a clue."  The dealer was too busy to work on it today...

9)  Passenger side front door has become very difficult to open and close.  It's at the dealer for the too today.

***This was fixed also...not enough lube.

Otherwise I love to drive this car.  It really handles well, has a lot of power (I put a mustang GT away the other night), and gets great gas mileage.  It's a shame that it has had sooo many problems in so little time.  

Make sure you bring some CD's in before getting the BOSE system.  It sounds better than stock...but that sub-woofer does not shake the car like you'd expect.  The system is also too powerful up front.  The speakers in the back hardly put out any power.

Any questions comments...  bapow1@hotmail.com  No abuse please...I've gotten enough of that from the car/dealers already.
