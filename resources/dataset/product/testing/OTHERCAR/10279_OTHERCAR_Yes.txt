                  I just recently bought a used 1997 Nissan Sentra GLE. I bought this car when my previous car bit the dust.  I looked around at cars for almost 4 months before buying this one.  I drive 30 miles to and from work in very heavy traffic, so the reliability of the car was a must.  I see wrecks everyday and wonder when it's going to my turn so the safety of it was also an issue.  So far, I have had this car for 6 months now, and it's been overall great.  I haven't had one problem with it since.  Plus, the 2 front airbags set me a little bit more at ease when driving next to that semi with that guy who looks like he just got his license.

     I would have to say that it's probably worth it to spend the extra money to get the GLE instead of the GXE.  I test drove both and it was a huge difference.  Now, I might have just been driving a bad GXE, but the GLE (the one that I bought), has a different suspension, which is very evident.  The GLE has a lot smoother ride (not to mention all the bells and whistles like power everything).  

     The few things I don't like about the car is 1)it's not a 'get up and go' car.  I find my self saying to it often, &quot;COME ON!&quot;.  It does ok though. 2)I think the front end could be more attractive, but I do like the looks of the rear.  
   Overall it's a good car for the money.  <br><br>
