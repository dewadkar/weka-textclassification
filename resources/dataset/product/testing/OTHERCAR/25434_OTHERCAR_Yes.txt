            We bought this car brand new on April 29,1998, this was our first new car purchase and since then we have purchased a used Saturn also.  When we decided to purchase this car, Saturn had come out with a limited/special edition coupe which is what we now have.  They made two styles white with black roof (White Hot) and red with black roof (Red Hot).

I love this car it is the best automobile I have ever driven, it is sporty, and the power that comes from it is remarkable, great gas mileage, excellent handling and for the cost of the car it didn't put a whole in our wallet.

We have our car serviced as suggested by Saturn and have never once run into a problem.  The only thing that I would change is the room for back seaters, we just use our other Saturn when we have guest travelers though.  This car since it was a special/limited edition was supposed to cost $20,000.00 fully loaded, but we got it for $16,000.00 which was less than what the dealer paid.      <br><br>
