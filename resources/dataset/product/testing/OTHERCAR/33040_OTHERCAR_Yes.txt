            Our 1993 Dodge Caravan was a godsend... We have four kids and a great need for a roomy vehicle.  The Caravan was great! It always started, never broke down and gave me a feeling of security that my wife and kids were driving a reliable car -err... van.  

Then when our lease was up, we decided to purchase it. Take a break from car payments for awhile.

Well, that was probably the biggest mistake we ever made. Prior to our buy-out of the lease, the only money I put into the car was for brake pads, oil changes, tires and the like.

Almost like clock-work, the transmission went... just died... while my family was in the car, far away from any help... very worrisome. Taking it to the dealer, we were advised that this was a very common problem with our vehicle's model year. Very common? Did he just say what I thought he said? Absolutely. But, because ours was out of warranty, the replacement for the tranny would only cost $1500. Wow! What a bargain for a common problem. Excuse me, but I thought that a problem would be something that the manufacturer would replace at no charge. Not so.

Anyhow, we had the transmission replaced and ate the $1500. I shouldn't use the term &quot;ate&quot; because the costly repair actually took food out of my family of six's mouth.

Well, then the real fun began. Leaks, leaks, smoking, burning oil and antifreeze. And no one can find where it's leaking from without taking apart the engine. Another costly repair job. And, keeping an eye-out on the road for Caravans of the same year, we see smoke billowing out of the tail-pipes all of the time! About 90% of them are smoking!?!

As soon as we can, we'll get rid of this minivan and lease a brand new one. Like I said, for the whole lease period, we had no problems, and I trust that I'll have no problems again... we just won't buy it at the end of the lease. I don't think they're reliable past 3-4 years.<br><br>
