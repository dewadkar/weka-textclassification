                Three years ago in March I purchased my first car: a used 96 Chevrolet Lumina, and since then I've never regretted it.  I purchased the car with 33,000 miles and its odometer now reads 60,000.  In the time I�ve owned it I've never had to do any maintenance on it (besides replacing the brake pads and changing the oil).  Chevrolet advertises the Lumina as a reliable car and in my experience it is.
    I�ll admit, anyone in the market for a luxury car or a sports car will be a tad disappointed.  However, the Lumina�s price reflects its goal: it�s not supposed to be fancy or fast!  It�s a pretty good looking car considering its age and its V6 has more punch than the engine in most other cars of the same class. 
  Besides its reliability, the Lumina has a safety record that allows parents to feel safe with their 16-year-old son driving it.  It�s a big car with front-wheel drive and anti-lock breaks (a must in snow) to prevent trouble and a steel safety cage to protect its occupants.   It�s interior isn�t fancy but it comfortably seats 5 people  and the driver has easy enough access to all the controls.
  I recommend the Lumina for anyone who wants a safe, reliable, and affordable car and who isn�t looking for luxury.
