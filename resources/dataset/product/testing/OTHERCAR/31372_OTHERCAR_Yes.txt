            Purchased this vehicle in August 2000 and have put on 7000 miles. 

Compared the Toyota Celica and Corolla, Olds Intrigue, Ford Mustang, Chevy Malibu, Dodge Stratus, Avenger, and Nissan Stanza.  I already own a late model Mustang and did not want another rear drive with poor gas mileage.  The Celica was overpriced, the Corolla was boring and overpriced.  The Malibu is boring, but already have one as a company vehicle and didn't want another one.  Handling and acceleration is much better on the Olds, completely different feel and look - no comparison between the vehicles although they are based on the same platform.  The devil is in the details - that makes the differences very significant.  If you are comparing, don't assume they are the same, they are not. 

The Intrigue is a much larger vehicle and is comparing apples to oranges - fine if you need a larger vehicle. Nissan was just cheap looking and feeling. I couldn't even fit inside the Stratus! (6' 200 lbs.) Similar story with the Avenger, the steering wheel hit my knees even after adjustment.  I have driven go carts with better ergonomics. Too bad, nice looking cars, although questionable reliability.  

Purchased the GL3 that comes with the 16 inch aluminum wheels and 3.4 L V-6 with 170 HP. The car comes with a number of techie goodies such as tire pressure monitoring (which has already indicated a low tire avoiding excessive wear and a possible blowout), and an oil change indicator.

Instrument panel is the best I have seen in a GM car. The CD and cassette player has fine sound.  Only a BOSE could give you a better sound from the factory and it isn't available on this model. There are two power outlets on the front dash for those electronic gizmos.   

Unfortunately, the GL3 comes with the rear spoiler that severely blocks your rear vision thru either the mirror or the rear window.  Delete it if you are considering purchase.  

Handling is more than adequate for this class of vehicle.  It will go around any exit ramp with more than enough enthusiasm with little squeal and a moderate amount of front wheel drive plow even at extra-legal speeds.  I have trained law enforcement officers and done some road racing in the past and this car could keep up with our best squads on the track. It is sporty, not a sports car.  It will not keep up with a Corvette, Mazda Miata or Honda S2000.  

Acceleration is excellent. The 3.4 will get you to those extra-legal speeds in no time at all.  Drove the 4 cylinder and it has adequate power, but it sure works for it and you feel every rev.  The V-6 is much smoother and unobtrusive, but you know its there when you need it. Gas mileage is exactly between the two EPA city/highway estimates. 

Braking with the ABS is also just fine.  ABS is noisy when activated and lots of pulsating, common to the GM ABS system. 

This is a compact car and it shows on the inside.  Room is limited but comfortable.  It is fine for commuting.  No cross country trips would be advisable for 4 adults though.  Rear seat room is also much better than the competition. 2 adults can sit comfortably for short trips. 

At list, the price is way too high - $21,000, but the dealer was more than willing to deal and got it for $18,000 which makes it a deal when you consider what you get. 

The only defect is a shaky driver side outside mirror.  Common on this model and the dealer was eager to repair, free of charge under warranty. Only service required, so far is oil changes.  100,000 mile spark plugs and coolant.
  
This sure ain't your father's Oldsmobile.  Stylish (if you like that aero look). Excellent acceleration, good handling and nice comfort for a compact car.  Too bad GM has decided to eliminate the brand.  The only brand in which all of the models could go in my garage.  Why not Buick?  Who would buy an ugly Buick (seen a Regal lately??? UGHH!!!!) when you could have an up to date good looking Aurora, Bravada, Intrigue, Alero or Silohuette.
