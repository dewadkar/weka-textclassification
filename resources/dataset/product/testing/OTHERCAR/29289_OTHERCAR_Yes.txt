            Has anyone noticed that on game shows like &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; and &quot;the price is right&quot; they are always giving away chevy camaro's.  Could this be such a good car that anyone would desire it?

They chevy camaro is a very classic car.  They were produced &quot;back in the day&quot; and are now used as muscle cars or speedsters.  Not that many people have camaro's though.  Could it be the price?  I don't think so.  

Chevy camero's start anywhere from $25,000 to $45,000 offering all of the features.  Here are some of them:

-Convertaible
-Fast
-Fun
-Sporty
-Metalic glossy paint
-Aerodynamic
-to die for
-powerful
-high quality

These are just some of the things that would make your mouth water.  However no one really knows unless they own one, which I don't.
