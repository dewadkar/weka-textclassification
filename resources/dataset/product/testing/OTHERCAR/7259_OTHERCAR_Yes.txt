            My 1997 Pontiac Grand Am has been a great little car and has served me well, but last month it was time to start looking for something new.  I wanted something bigger, with more power.  Something that felt solid and tight.  I went to my local GM dealership (McElwain in Elwood City) to see what they had on the lot.  After much test-driving and searching I saw a speeding ticket red Grand Prix.  I was sold before we even left the lot.

The current Grand Prix (due for a replacement in 2004) bowed in 1997.  It featured Pontiac's trademark "Widetrack" design and clean new sheet metal that has won accolades for its styling.  Wide, thin headlights surround the Pontiac requisite twin grills above two round foglights pushed to the corners of the front fascia.  The elegant greenhouse flows smoothly to the rear glass &#150 a rarity with sedans.  Two large taillamps are flanked by a low wing, which sweeps across the tail above the dual oval exhaust tips.  Overall, the exterior of the car is aggressive and sporty, one of the best Pontiac designs in quite some time.

Inside, the Grand Prix &#150 like most GM products &#150 is covered with somewhat cheap plastic and cloth.  Controls, however, are intuitively laid out and feature large, easy-to-read buttons and knobs.  The instrument cluster features large analog instrumentation complete with a tachometer, speedometer, water temperature and fuel level.  Unfortunately, engineers decided to opt for a single GM &#147Super Stalk&#148 for windshield wiper, cruise control and turn signal functions.  I do not understand why a second stalk could have been added to the right of the steering wheel as in the Grand Am as the shift knob is located between the seats.  Storage space is generous with an array of &#147nooks&#148 throughout the car.  In front of the center armrest are dual flip-out cup holders that will accommodate large drinks from your favorite fast food restaurant.  Rear seat passengers will find a fold-down armrest complete with storage space and dual cup holders, as well as trunk access.  Front seats are firm and supportive, but could have been better bolstered for better lateral support during spirited driving.  Passengers riding in the back will have no qualms for short trips, but pack four of your friends in the car for a road trip and they&#146ll soon be fighting for the front seat.

The Grand Prix comes in three two trim levels.  The SE is powered by a 3.1 V6 good for 175 horsepower.  Step up to the GT and you&#146ll find a 3.8 Series II V6 (optional on the SE) good for 200 horsepower and 225 ft-lbs of good old American torque.  Order the GTP package on the GT and Pontiac ups the ante by adding a supercharger, serving up 240 horsepower and a whopping 280 ft-lbs of tire-melting torque.  Power is routed through a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission.

Driving the Grand Prix is a revelation for those of you who are used to the floaty feel of larger GM cars of years past.  This car is SOLID.  Steering is tight and precise and body roll is negligible.  Toss the car into a corner at double the posted speed and it will remain poised and smooth.  Things get a little unstable when bumps are encountered mid-corner, but this is a minor qualm with an otherwise great suspension setup.  Power from the naturally aspirated 3.8 V6 is impressive.  Lots of low-end grunt down low and a smooth, linear powerband are just some of the reasons that GM uses this engine in many of its products.

Overall, you can&#146t go wrong with this car.  It packs performance, comfort and features into a very affordable package.  I was very close to signing a lease on a 2003 Mazda 6s until I drove this car.  I bought this car with only 21,000 miles on the odometer for only $12,500 &#150 a sound bargain no matter who you&#146re talking to.
