            It was a late summer day and time was running out for the closing on our new house.  I was diving a 9 month old Audi A4 2.8 Q equipped to perfection but we decided to cash out and drive cheap.  We had arranged in advance with a local VW/Audi dealer to look at two Jetta TDIs he had.

The press on these cars was positive but the expectation was being last in line off the pole, oops toll plaza.  Put away all those preconceptions because this four cylinder diesel has a powerful heart.  I did not put a stop watch on it but I figure 0-60 times under 8.0 seconds,(downhill slightly better) 

Admittedly, this car lacks the silk and glue of the A4, but there is no apology for its responsive turbo diesel.  A few items were not so pleasant.

  1. It did not create billowing smoke to impair your pursuers vision.

  2. There is no optional cd/tape deck as a single unit.

  3. The standard Goodyear radials were square and trucky sounding.

  4. When they ordered carpeting they must of shipped underlayment.

Beside these little oddities this is a wonderful car that loves to just go and go even in the coldest climate this vehicle has started flawlessly and in over 50,000 miles it needed to go in for warranty work once and this was due to an over zealous tech overfilling the battery which boiled out and onto the shifter linkage.  The incident occurred on a Friday late and the dealer was very cooperative.  The car was able to drive in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th so to the dealer we went and we were provided a loaner during the inconvenience.  

Fuel economy is stated to be 49mpg highway and you can actually do better if you drive less aggressively. If you need to get lots of places or perhaps you wander about lost not wanting to ask directions this is a car to consider.

On the body side of repairs, I was the victim of a parking lot hit and run, but to my surprise the panels were inexpensive and the headlamp assembly was about 1/3rd the cost of the typical European car. This was a big savings to my insurance company and the total repair barely exceeded the deductible.  

We did opt for the power package and 6 disc changer and premium sound and there is probably no other car for the money that can deliver the range of acoustic reality.  I think they still say &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot;.

As of today the Jetta has continued to perform without a stumble, the original trucky Goodyears got peeled off at 55,000 mile and replaced with another &quot;better&quot; Goodyear RSA and there is no question that these tires are rounder and somewhat quieter.  There has been one additional repair since new and this was a very simple repair, rear wheel bearings.  

In the 'for what it is worth department' I have done all the oil changes with synthetic oil at 5,000 mile intervals.  At the last service I thoroughly inspected all normal wear items and I will be replacing the auxiliary belts at the next service and as for the other anticipated repairs well I do not see anything before 90,000 miles when I will do the timing belt and possibly replace the original front brake pads and rear muffler.

I think this car is far better than I initially anticipated so I would highly recommend this Vee Dub to would be critics even.<br><br>
