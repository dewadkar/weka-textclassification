            I recently spent a week with my grandmother and she is the extremely proud owner of a red 2000 Lincoln Navigator.  This is her second Navigator - she had a silver 1999 model, but my grandfather decided a 2000 would make a great Christmas present for her.  (I wish they'd spend that kind of money on me!)  So we spent the entire week riding in her &quot;baby&quot; because wel, she's grandma and she wanted to.

I must say that although I am not just in love with the look of this SUV, I was very impressed with the ride and features.  Don't get me wrong - it looks great, but my grandparents own one therefore I associate it as a &quot;grandma car&quot;.  Anyway, of course Grandma has the top of the line - leather interior, CD, knick-knacks and more little hidey-holes than you could possibly find stuff to put in them.  You can fit a lot of people in this thing too.  We're talking 20-25 teenagers, at least, if you were going for some kind of record.  Of course you couldn't ride with that many in here.  What I mean is it is roomy.  There is plenty of space for everything.  You wouldn't need to put luggage on top of this on a family vacation.

The ride is very smooth and that really surprised me.  I've been in other SUVs before and they were kind of bumpy, similar to most trucks.  But this one almost rides like a car, very smooth and really not bad at all.  The seats are comfortable too.  Maybe it was the leather, maybe not, but I could have slept just fine sitting in that seat.

So my experience with the Lincoln Navigator was a good one.  As someone who does not own one, I may not be aware of some possible drawbacks that an owner might know if, but let me just tell you this much:  if there was something not perfect about this car, my Grandmother would take it back and get something else.  That's just the way she is.  So I can pretty confidently say that this is well worth the money, if you can afford it!<br><br>
