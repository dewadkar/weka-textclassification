            It was last year that my family ditched the old Mazda MPV, which was getting very old and reliable for a new minivan, the Toyota Sienna.  The van looked great when we first bought it and today it is still hasn't failed us.  I have both been a driver and a passenger and I can make the following comments:

- This minivan handles extremely well.  The steering is very responsive, and like a car rather than a clunky van.  

- The acceleration is quicker than many other vans.  

- The seats feel comfortable and leave you relaxed while driving.  

- It comes with the standard sound system with cd player, tape player, and radio.  There is bass, treble, etc controls.

- There are cup holders everywhere to hold drinks.

- Air conditioning throughout the entire car.

- Plenty of leg space in the front.

- Good mileage.  Over 20 miles per gallon.

- Dual sliding doors.

- Sleek design makes it look cool.

- Great for trips.

- Great for families.

- Removable seats allow you to remove seats and provide more space for storage and transferring larger items.

- Smooth driving.  No bouncing around.
