            The Buick Century is being touted as the &quot;Safe Family Car&quot; for those who can't afford the luxury of a Lexus or Cadillac.  It even has built-in tether anchors for your car seats.  What they don't tell you is that your car seat may not fit in this car.  You see, the back seat is equipped with seat belts that have long buckles.  Long buckles spell T*R*O*U*B*L*E for car seat installation and make it virtually impossible to get the car seat TIGHT, which is the very thing that makes it SAFE.

So, unless you can work wonders with car seats or have an unusual car seat, you may be running around in this &quot;Safe Family Car&quot; with your kids buckled NOT SO SAFE in the backseat.

Speaking of the backseat, OOOF.  Sorry, that was me trying to squeeze into the back seat.  Buicks being GM cars, you'd think that the size of the backseat would be at least as big (and hopefully bigger) than some of the lower end GM cars, like the Chevy Lumina.  NOT SO.  This is a little backseat, and your kids will be complaining that &quot;I'm cramped.  She's touching me.  Get your feet away from me.&quot; and everything else under the sun because they truly will be sitting in a sardine can of a back seat.

Want a safe family car?  This isn't exactly it.  Maybe next year they'll get it right.<br><br>
