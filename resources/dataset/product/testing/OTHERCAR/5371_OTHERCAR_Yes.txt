            I drive a 95 Nissan Sentra and have never had any type of problems.  The ride is very smooth and it gets great gas mileage.  When I put the 93 octane in I consistently get 30 mpg.  When I put the less expensive gas in, my gas mileage drops to 26-28 mpg, so I don't do that often.  

I put tons of mileage on my Sentra because I am a pet sitter.  I will reach the 100,000 mile mark in March probably and the only thing I have had to do is replace a starter.  Other than that I just keep the oil changed.  

I don't know anything about cars and don't want to have to know about cars.  That is why I bought a Sentra.  When we were looking for a truck for my boyfriend one of the salespeople noticed our Sentra.  We told him this was our work car and he said, &quot;Well you couldn't have picked a better one, them Nissan's run like they're possessed by the devil.&quot;  He said they will just never die.  Pretty good recommendation from a guy at a Ford dealership, huh?

The only con I can think of is because of the smaller engine my Sentra doesn't have a lot of pick up.  This has never been a problem for me but I have noticed that whenever a man has had a reason to drive my car they have complained about this.

I would urge anyone who has to have a dependable vehicle and doesn't want to have to do anything except keep gas in the tank and the oil changed to get a Sentra.<br><br>
