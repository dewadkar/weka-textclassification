            This is a car that I really enjoy. Getting to highway speeds is a load of fun, and driving on the freeway gives you a strong sense of power. I added a Global Positioning System to mine, and a K 40 Radar Detector. Fog lights were also added . Keep in mind not to buy the blue bulbs to make it look cooler, because it'll ruin the lights. I'm not sure about how often this car is stolen, but I added a viper alarm system, with a remote start. The big problem I have besides the trunk space, is the fact that it has zero traction in the snow. The reason is that it's rear wheel drive, but the weight is in the front. The only way out is to put 8 sand bags in the trunk.
