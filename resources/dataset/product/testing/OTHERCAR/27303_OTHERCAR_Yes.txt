                This is truly a great sports utility vehicle.  I was lucky enough to get behind the wheel of one of these beasts.  My uncle purchased an aqua colored Durango a couple of months ago.  He happens to live about an hour away from the Rocky Mountains.  Three weeks ago he decided to take my brother and I on a camping trip up there.  Being the nice guy that he is, we both got a chance to drive.  I have never enjoyed driving so much in my life.  My family owns a 98' sub-urban, but after experiencing the Durango I have tried to get my dad to do a trade in.  Of course he won't listen to me because, &quot;I'm 18 and know nothing&quot;, but then again he hasn't driven the Durango yet.  It is very responsive, and the steering is very smooth.  My experience of driving only lasted a half hour, but I noticed how well the traction was.  Their was a thin sheet of ice on the road, but I could hardly ever notice it.  I guess two other parts of this SUV that were important to me, and probably any other young guy, was the stereo system and the power of the Durango.  My uncle's Durango came with a sweet CD player with surround sound.  I don't think their is any need to upgrade the system that comes stock with the Durango.  Of course if you love to blast your music so the neighbor hood can hear it, maybe your opinion would be different.  The style of the Durango is striking, as anyone can see, and you would just have to take a test drive to feel the power behind it.  I would recommend this vehicle for someone who is looking for a fun, exciting, and at the same time practical vehicle.  One last thing to mention is the interior very stylish, and seats can be moved for long camping trips or whatever. I have to give this sweet ride two thumbs up.<br><br>
