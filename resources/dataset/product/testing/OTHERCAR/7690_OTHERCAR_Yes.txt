            I bought this car in 1991 while I was in college because it was inexpensive.  After 9 years and 150,000 miles, the car is still going strong.  The only work that has been performed on the car are oil changes every 3,000 miles, 1 set of new tires at 80,000 miles, 2 sets of brake pads (the first set was around 70,000-75,000 miles), and a fuel pump, which happened to be a recall.  Around 1998, the paint began to oxidize, which may have been a result from living in a heavily polluted city and near a major airport.  Also, with time, the brakes have begun to squeak when applied (the brakes work just fine, they just squeak).  It seems that no matter what work is performed on the brakes, the squeak remains.  My family has owned numerous Nissan cars and all of the cars began to squeak after a couple of years.  When driving at 55 mph or faster, there is a little wind noise and road noise.  

The car may appear small from the outside, but I was able to pack all of my belongings in the car during my moves back and forth from college and home (that included a computer and a compact refrigerator).  My only regret is buying the 2 door instead of the 4 door.  It is difficult to get in and out of the back seats of the 2 door as well as getting children into their car seats.  In the back seat, three average sized adults can fit but it is a little cramped and three children or small adults can fit comfortably.  

This car is a great first time car.  It was my first car and I still have it after marriage and two kids.  <br><br>
