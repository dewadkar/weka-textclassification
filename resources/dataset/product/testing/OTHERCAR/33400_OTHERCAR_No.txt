            As soon as I saw that they redesigned the Jetta, I had to have one.  It drove solidly, and looked great.  I think I got taken on the deal (VW dealers in the Northern VA area are crooks), but I didn't care.  I had a fun new car.  The first year and a half was great.  Free scheduled maintenance for the first 24k miles meant all I had to do was put gas in it and take it in to the dealer once in a while (more on the dealers later).  

At about 20k miles, my first problem occurred.  The dash lights behind the climate control area went out.  I had to take the car in to get that fixed.  Luckily, under warranty.  At about the point the warranty ran out (24k miles), I noticed the power locks acting funny.  You see, when you get over 10 mph or so, all doors lock.  At this point, the driver's door lock only engages about half the time.  Doesn't bode well for their future.  

And now, at about 33k miles, two problems have just occurred.  First, my battery went dead.  Not good considering the mileage.  The battery, by the way is nearly impossible to get out to change unless you buy ratchet extensions, etc. and have a TON of patience.  The engine looks cool when you open the hood, but access to the innards is hampered as a result.  

Second, my right front power window broke.  Fell right into the door.  I took it in to the dealership (it took me a week to get an appointment, and that was the "shortest waiting time in the region"), and the guy acted as if it was a common problem.  Someone else in the place seemed to have the same thing.  A couple hours later after waiting there (no loaner cars!) I was informed that it would cost 350 bucks to fix.  All I could answer (after the initial shock) was "That's totally unreasonable", and left with my window still inoperable.  

Which brings me to my largest complaint about VW:  Their dealerships.  All four of the dealers I've been to in my area are shady and rude.  They don't treat their customers with much respect.  (Sure, I'm a 24 year-old male, but that doesn't mean you can ignore me, talk down to me, and make me regret doing business with you!)  It always takes at least a week to get a service appointment, even for an oil change.  Perhaps their service departments are overburdened due to the low quality of their cars?


I know it sounds like I'm just attempting to trash VW after my one bad experience, but realize that until about a year ago I was a die-hard VW fan.  I loved my car and intended to have it for a while.  At this point, I think it may be better for me to take the hit and bail from my lease.  Paying for ridiculously expensive repairs on a car that isn't mine makes no sense.  Hopefully, VW fixed lots of these problems in newer model Jettas, but only time will tell.  Mine is the first following the redesign.  I knew there was something strange about a German car made in Mexico...
