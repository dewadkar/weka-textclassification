            Having a family of six, buying a van was a no brainer. The adverstising blitz by plymouth on voyager and it's two sliding door's convinced me to buy it. Boy was that biggest mistake of my life. Nothing but trouble from the start. The brakes went first. Calipers froze and were defective. Then the engine malfunction light would not go off. Took the van to the dealer 10 times and they still could not figure it out. Then at 40k miles the transmission went out. Obviously this was not covered under warranty. The dealer fixed the transmission and within 7 months it went out again. My advice to you is to stay as far away as possible from this van.
