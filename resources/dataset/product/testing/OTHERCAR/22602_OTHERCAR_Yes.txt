              I had bought this vehicle because I had made quite a nice sum of money in the stock market so before college started I decided to buy my favorite VW.

 When talking about this car you cannot think of anything you hate about it. The seats are so comfortable, the trunk is surprisingly roomy considering that it is a hatchback, it handles incredibly even before it was modified. The gas mileage is adequate considering that when you are whipping around turns and streets you do go through gas rather quickly.

Absolutely everything about this car is good; they had even improved upon the way it handles in the rain, snow, and any other not so favorable weather elements.

Considering any other cars in a similar price range, well go and test drive them you will not even come close to being satisfied with them when you compare it to the GTI. One thing that I must strongly recommend is that you get both the VR6 upgrade and that you will buy this car in its true form; a manual. This car like my Jetta does not perform even close to its true capability with an automatic transmission.

All of the positives that I applied to my review of my Jetta applies to this car and then some. It is like you are trading trunk space for performance, and in my mind this was a great trade off.

    So please if you are serious about buying a VW go and look at my review of my Jetta because I feel that these are the two to buy right now.

   Remember Hondas are evil, support Volkswagen.
