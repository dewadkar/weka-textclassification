            I just returned from a business trip, yesterday.  Since it was in-state, I had to drive a university car.  I was issued a 1996 Dodge Intrepid.  First of all, I was impressed by the size of the car.  It didn't seem all that big from the outside, but once I sat down, the car seemed to grow.  There was a lot of room in the passenger compartment.  

Well, I started my three hour drive to western Maryland.  I found that the acceleration and pick up was great.  When I hit the gas, the picked up, and flew.  The ride was <b>very</b> comfortable, as far as the road noise, and suspension went.  I didn't like the seat too much though.  It was hard to adjust, both the seat, and the head rest.  I also found that the neat little cup holder in the center console got in the way of my right arm.  I kept hitting the cups with my elbow, and they almost tipped over when I made a sharp turn.

Mileage was pretty good.  I drove about 300 miles on a little more than half tank of gas (about 8 Gallons....37mpg).  The trunk was huge!  But the car I drove did not have fold down rear seats, which I happen to like (I spend a lot of money at Home Depot/Lowe's and need the extra space to put stuff).

In all, this was a very nice car to drive.  The car I had in particular, was an automatic with A/C (which worked very well).  The stereo system provided a nice quality sound.  And the motorized side mirrors made it easy to adjust.  The car itself was a fleet car, and had over 109,000 miles on it, and it still held up well!!  If you are a Dodge fan (and I am usually not) and you are looking for a new, or used four door sedan, I think you should try the Dodge Intrepid....It's smooth ride, and quick acceleration make it a dream to drive.<br><br>
