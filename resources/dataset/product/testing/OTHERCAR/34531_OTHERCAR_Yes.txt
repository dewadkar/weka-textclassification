            I bought this camera last year to replace a Casio camera that broke (I am pretty rough on my cameras).  I immediately went out and bought a 20meg compact flash card to replace the tiny card that came with the unit.  I also bought a Viking Compact Flash Adapter for PCMCIA, so I could plug the card into my laptop.  The camera works like a charm and takes great pictures, especially given its low price compared to similar cameras.  I normally use the medium resolution mode and get pics that look great even when blow up to fill a 20&quot; monitor or an 8.5x11 sheet of paper.  The 20 meg card holds 43 pics at medium resolution, and this is plenty.  I've taken about 1000 pictures with this camera, and gotten some really nice results - on average, about as good as I get with my film camera.
Much as I love the C20, there are some minuses:  
1.  There is a significant delay between pressing the button and taking the shot, so candid shots are a lot harder.
2.  There is a significant delay in between shots to store the image.
3.  The display, which can be turned off easily, sucks batteries fast.
4.  It takes 3 button presses to turn off the built-in flash.
Despite this, I am very pleased with the C20 - like any HP product, it has put up with a lot of abuse and still performs admirably a year later.<br><br>
