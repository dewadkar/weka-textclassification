            I've been driving a 1991 Plymouth Sundance for far too long, so I'm actively shopping for a new car.  Now, I have to say I'm bitterly cheap so I'm looking at economy cars, 1 to 3 years old.  I couldn't let the opportunity to look a Sunfire over pass me by.  They're cheaper than dirt.  One test drive later and I could see why.  I tested another to make sure it wasn't just one bad car.

Both models I tested were automatic transmission.  I'm not sure what option packages were included.  They were not convertibles.

The interior has the feel of children's toys that are assembled on a high-speed conveyor belt somewhere in Southeast Asia.  It doesn't quite fit right.  I tried this one right after a Grand Am, so I'm not comparing apples to oranges.  GM really went cheap on the console.

The next thing I noticed, from the outside, was that the body panels didn't fit just right.  The door closed okay, but you could see it wasn't positioned exactly where it was supposed to be.  The hood was slightly higher than the body panels beside it.  I asked the salesman how many accidents the car had been in and he said it had been in none.  I realize that by law he would only have to tell me about crashes causing $500 or more in damage.  All he would say was that the condition of the car was taken into consideration when they put the price tag on it.

The ride of the car was poor, but consistent with one that's been treated badly, like the condition of the body would suggest.  I handed it back and told the salesman I was disgusted with it, and that even the low price they were asking was too much.

I have since tried another one, and it was the same story.  The hood was popped up slightly, just like before.  I've asked mechanics whether it might be the construction of the car that causes that kind of damage, and what has been suggested to me is that they may have been subjected to some kind of jarring motion, such as running up on a curb.

I've driven into potholes that popped off my hubcaps and launched them over people's houses, and my car's frame is still as solid as ever.  I don't buy the opinion that this is normal wear and tear.  I suspect that this car is either badly designed, or badly built.  Either way, it's unacceptably cheap.

Even for the price, I can't honestly say that you get what you pay for with this car.  Basically, I'd call it a big, overpriced toy.<br><br>
