            Years back I was dumb enough to purchase a Chrysler Dodge 2.2 Charger ... my dumb mistake!  It was a terrible little vehicle and I bought it new in 1985.  After the bad taste Chrysler left in my mouth I vowed to never try them again.  Well, I guess it is true what they say about time and memory and you tend to forget... a very expensive lesson has now ensued.  I bought the 1997 Dodge Caravan because the Consumer Reports rated it right next to the 
Windstar in crash tests.  Thus, I purchased a minivan thinking with adding the name Daimler that maybe Chrysler improved.  Shame on me for buying Chrysler twice.

The first week I have a cracked head gasket right off the factory floor.  Of course they replaced it but I had to beg Klaben Dodge in Ohio to get a rental car.  I finally got the rental at their charge. The head gasket was replaced again in North Carolina at Lake Norman Dodge and I was told that many of the Caravans have their head gaskets replaced because there is something that doesn't "sit right" in the mount.  He also informed me that I needed to expect that the head gasket will crack again.  Whew Hew!!  Are we having fun yet?

Then it started making this horrible noise when you turn the steering wheel and it only happens when it is hot out.  Well, the shop couldn't figure out what that noise was and said it doesn't happen much.  The next shop I tried (after I moved to North Carolina) told me the noise was in my head.  Every time someone in my family says what the heck is that noise?  I respond, "It's in your head!"  You have to try to find some humor in the situation.

After two years the transmission needed a complete overhaul, the glove box (while driving down the road one day) just fell out of it's "hole", for lack of a better term.  Rack and pinions have been replaced.  The entire fuel injection system has been replaced.  The air conditioning compressor has been replaced at $1,200. and only blows on high because it would take more diagnostic tests to figure out why it is doing this and could run another $50. to $500.  You name it, it has fallen off my mini van with mostly highway miles.  In the past two years my repairs have nearly been $4,000. and all out of warranty.  Now I have been researching on line and have found that a great many of the consumers that have purchased these big lemons have had the same repairs.  Could Chrysler have done a recall?  It would have been nice because I can't afford to keep this piece of junk!

The only good thing I could say is that it is very roomy and great for hauling things and for taking family members to dinner, etc.  Oh, and that's if it doesn't break down on the way.  By the way, all the dash lights are blinking, but no one can figure out why without hundreds of dollars of tests and this includes the dealership in NC at Lake Norman which also cost me hundreds of dollars of questionable repairs.  

I have finally learned my lesson ... Chrysler STINKS! Shame on me for not learning the first time in 1985 ... they say those that don't learn are doomed to repeat the same mistakes .... you can bet I get the message this time!

Boo Chrysler!!!  Boo Dodge!!!! They should all be painted yellow, squished and sold as LEMONADE!!!  Isn't that what you're supposed to do when life deals you a lemon!  I can see why Honda, Toyota and Mazda sell better than the so-called 100% American made cars!  I do not recommend the Dodge Albatross Caravan to anyone that doesn't have an endless bankroll to dump into it ... It would even be irritating if I had the extra money to dump into it just because of all the time the vehicle has spent in the garage and all the car borrowing and "rides" I have had to get with regard to the Caravan needing so many repairs.  On a side note.  I have never wrecked the vehicle and purchased it new ...
