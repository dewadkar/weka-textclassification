            I have used Nikon 35mm cameras for many years. I have also bought many point &amp; shoot cameras. When digital point &amp; shoot cameras exceeded three megapixels, I learned I could get sharp 8x10 prints on my inkjet printer that came close to the quality of 35mm 8x10's. 

The Coolpix 990 has many of the same features as its 35mm counterparts. For example, it has similar metering patterns: matrix, center-weighted, and spot. It also has selectable focusing and spot metering areas, just like the F5 and F100 35mm cameras. It also has flash compensation, exposure compensation, fill flash, red-eye reduction, and slow sync flash, just like the 35mm &quot;big boys&quot;.

If all this sounds complicated, trust your instincts. This is a camera aimed at experienced photographers, or those who are interested in a fully adjustable point and shoot digital camera with all the bells and whistles. A nice feature of this camera is that it also has an &quot;automatic&quot; mode, which makes most of the decisions for you. 

That mode yields acceptable results, and is a nice way to get used to the camera. I would recommend this camera to someone who is very interested in top quality digital photography. With the automatic mode, even the more timid or inexperienced members of the family can use it and get good results. One final bit of advice: Expect to buy additional Compact Flash storage media cards. I carry two 128MB cards with me and can shoot all day without worries. Good Luck!
