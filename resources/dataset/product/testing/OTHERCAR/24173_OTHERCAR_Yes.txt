            I own a chevrolet camaro and I would never give it up or sell it.  It is one of the nicest cars I've had in my life.  I had a Monte Carlo SS and that was a pretty awesome car until I traded it for a brand new camaro.  This camaro will last me forever if I don't treat it like I have been.  I like to lay rubber and sort of get the engine revved up until the rpm's are in the red zone.  It can go from 0-70 faster than any ford.  I would say about 7 seconds.  I had it modified so I could have something better than my other friends with the same kind of car.  I paid an extra thousand to get a BOSE stereo system installed( it is better than any pimps stereo)and she put's out 387 horsepower.  It is a nice car that will put you back in your seat.  You put a 100 dollar bill on the dash and go from 0-70 while trying to grab the money, I guarentee that you will not get the money.  All of the power sort of acts like a seatbelt when you are taking off.  I recommend this car to everyone and hope you can afford it.  It is a comfortable car and has electric windows and seats.  Well the driver seat is automatic and I like it.  The stock tires aren't very good in the snow unless you have weight in the back, otherwise you should get better snow tires(smoke em').  Other than the tires the car rules.  Get one!<br><br>
