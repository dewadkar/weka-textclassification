            As a means of supplemental income I recently started my own business as a mobile DJ.  Therefore, though I really didn't need a reason to WANT one, I had a reason to purchase my first SUV.  After months of shopping around and looking for the right vehicle for the right price, I came to what I think is the best decision.  I went with a 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  I have yet to regret it!  Of course, it helped that the previous owner took immaculate care of the Jeep, but it's really great.  If you are looking for cargo space, and I was, this is for you.  Due to the fact that you can either flip the rear seat up or completely remove it, and then lay the back down flat, you get huge results when it comes to space.  I also found that the "strap rings", that are mounted discretely to the floor in the back of the vehicle, are a wonderful way to secure any fragile items.  However, if you have too much stuff to fit into the enclosure, the sport comes equipped with a luggage rack on top, (for the kids)!  As for handling, I couldn't ask for more.  The steering is perfectly responsive but not too loose.  And boy can this little guy get up and go!  Now, as with any vehicle, there are a couple of minor draw backs.  The first, and primary, is that the Sport has only two passenger doors.  So, if you have kids or intend to carry your grandparents around, you may find it a little inconvenient.  The only other snag is that there are absolutely no cup holders in the front.  There are, however, two in the back.  Hmmmmmm.  Anyway, these are minor faults as far as I'm concerned.  Jeep really did a great job with this one!
