            I wasn't real sure about getting a truck, I was spoiled by our 94 Suburban and really couldn't convince DH not to get rid off it. He felt that we didn't need that seating capacity now that the kids were older. He was right. :) Anyway..He brought home a 99 Silverado this past summer and I LOVE it. It rides like a Suburban, has many of the same features and is so comfortable.

I love the seat adjustments.. they are an important issue in our house as there is 10&quot; between my DH and I. When I drive the truck I feel like I am driving my Malibu which I love as well.

We have the king cab and the one thing I wish it had was a way to force the back door to close before the front. I am so sure my kids or I will smash up the front door. You must make a mental note to close back first.

The auto alarm/door system is great. I love that the doors automatically lock when you place the truck in drive.

There really is nothing except lower gas mileage that I dislike about the truck, I can live with this though as we had same issue with Suburban.

You can't lose with this truck<br><br>
