            I know most consumer reports try to deal with product specifics.  Perhaps that is as it should be.  However, for most common purchasers, buying an automobile is an experience of hope, ownership pride, and excitement, which usually crosses one&#146s mind with something like <b>"ALRIGHT!  A NEW CAR!  YES!"</b>  Of course the product itself may be used, but the approaching ownership is the <b>"NEW!"</b> flashing in the eyes and mind of the purchaser.  I think reviewing a specific product should contain specific information on the product; however, consumer satisfaction, or not, - the experience - also gives consumer product readers eye opening information related to the specific product also.  As a consumer, and possible purchaser, would you really not want to know the true satisfaction possible with a purchase of nearly $9,000 in value?

I now see automobile purchasing in only one stage - the signed, sealed, and done deal <b>purchasing</b> stage.  There may be other important stages; however, this stage means <b>you</b> own the automobile, and the dealership owns the money!  <b>Please, be careful.</b>

There&#146s the <b>need</b> - not a desperate one - but a need.  Of course we - the wife and I - broke that first cardinal rule.  The old 1991 Chevy S-10 seemed wore out by the 30 or so miles into Houston, which meant "Buy another automobile," or "the wife loses her job."  Certainly a desperate choice, but it really did not take a lot of brains.

Then comes the <b>recommendation</b> (hopefully from a trusted relative or friend.)  My younger brother loved his Nissan product, and our trusted and loyal mechanic of years said, "Nissan?  You just can not find a product easier to maintain, that is if you ever need to."  I hope you see why I now have a different loyal and trusted mechanic.  I do think it is wise to have a used vehicle checked out independently; however, be sure the checking mechanic shop is well known and reputable.

So, it was off to our nearest Nissan dealership, which just three miles down I-10 East from our residence.  Now how convenient could that be, if you "ever need to?"

Next cardinal rule?  Know your budget, and <b>STICK</b> to it!  Being the auditor and keeper of the family funds I knew any purchase over $3000 would become an excessive burden on the family budget.  However, my wife brought home the bacon.  I saw myself in the advisory role.  We have a standing rule between myself and my wife:  We discuss any purchase costing over $100.  Believe me, it is a safe way to avoid disaster.  But, once you have advisory council it still comes down to consideration.  Again, believe me, that when a woman raises two handicapped children, cares for a disabled husband, dedicates 17 years to earning that BS degree, and holds the bread winning job - there is a great deal of respect and consideration due her and her desires!  So, in this matter, it came down to a simple saying, "If you make the money honey, you get the final say!"  It is not always a wise saying, but it carries powerful weight.  I had done my advisory duty in quoting the $3000 purchase limit, and I did it with great emphasis on the budget disaster that would result in crossing the limit.  No.  That is not an attempt to dismiss my responsibility toward the resulting purchase.  It is just the facts.  So, let us go meet the Nissan dealership salesman.

The salesman seemed like a dream.  The dealer did great at not revealing a snicker toward our $3000 limit on the purchase price.  He actually let us know anything under $5000 just would not be found on a Nissan lot.  Alright, we are despaired, but we could at least look at his available inventory.  Right?  (<b>WARNING!</b>  We just broke the second cardinal rule!)

The salesman let us test drive a rather divine Chevy van; however, it was not a Nissan product, which meant there would be no warranty provided.  No warranty!  That did not make any sense on a purchase of nearly $9,000!  The van idea was ditched.  We were so smart on that one.

Then it appeared - a Nissan 1999 Sentra SE, and it was only $8295, and $518.44 sales tax, and $22.79 vehicle inventory tax, and $15.50 title charge, and $50 documentary charge, which presented a grand total cost of $8901.73!  The salesman made sure to mention the full warranty coverage.  He did not check it off as, "in effect," on the contract&#146s fine print, which we would notice much later, and way too late, but he did mention the full warranty coverage.  Now that is watching out for the $3000 budget limit!

Naturally I checked the car out from top to bottom.  The oil appeared new (it was), and there was not a detectable scratch anywhere.  I even kicked the tires.  It did not have anything to do with the well being of the car, but do it anyway.  It may turn out to be the most satisfying part of the whole ordeal.

Of course there was the $1800 down payment.  "You only have $100 to put down?  Oh, you have a sufficient income tax return to cover the difference.   No problem.  We will be glad to finance that small amount until your return comes in.  Here, take the keys, use the car over the weekend.  We will figure it out Monday."

We were off, sailing down I-10 East, and parked in front of the house in less than ten minutes!  WOW, what an experience!  The four cylinder engine did not have any acceleration power, but it did seem to give a sports car ride all the way home.  And it was nice of the salesman to take only the $100?  And he let us have the car for the entire weekend, which meant my wife could make it into Houston to work her overtime Saturday!  WOW!  What a great opportunity to really check out the automobile!  And I did.  That oil was as new as the can from which it had just been poured.  A great car!  How are we going to fit it into the budget?  Well, we&#146ll see how it performs over the weekend.

Monday morning.  The car seemed to run like a dream over the weekend.  What car would not seem to run "like a dream," when compared to the rough ride of an old (still running) pickup?  "Well?  I will check on financing through the Credit Union (the only smart decision in the whole ordeal).  We need this car.  We will make it fit the budget!"  (Of course hardcore numbers do not change or lie, but what the heck.)

The salesman had the answers.  They would be glad to finance the car (despite our credit report).  Naturally Nissan would not do the financing; however, there was (an unknown) someone, who would put the deal through, and it would only be at 22 percent interest.  Wow!  What great consideration by the Nissan dealership.  They even went all the way to the dealership manager to get <b>approval</b>!  You just <b>could not</b> beat this dealership.  No. Really.  You could not beat them.  Well, maybe walking away from the entire deal would have worked.  If you are ever faced with this kind of deal, or these circumstances, <b>PLEASE, WALK AWAY!</b>

Upon calling my wife there came the only good news.  "The Credit Union will finance the automobile, and it will only be at an 11 percent interest rate.  And they will let me have the payments automatically taken from my paycheck every two weeks!"  Now how could a husband dash the hopes and dreams of such dedicated effort to make a deal work?  I could not.  On March 3, 2002 it was a signed, sealed, and done deal.  There are no more purchasing stages.  In fact, signing was the only purchasing stage that seemed to matter.  For once the IRS delivered right on time (that might have been a sign), and we made the down payment balance.  She had kept her pride of new ownership, and I delighted in her smile.  Dear Lord, please have mercy and grace on me.

About four month&#146s time passed.  It was a nice looking white car.  Nothing fancy, but nice.  Although, it did seem odd that the car needed a quart of oil exactly every seven days.  I was not sure about that.  I took the car back to the dealership.  Sure enough, it had an oil leak.  "That is alright," said the maintenance manager, "The computer says you only have a fifty dollar deductible on your warranty, and we take care of the rest."  That was good; however, the strapped budget did not quite have a clear fifty bucks to spare.  We determined to save the fifty dollars and return to complete the repair at a later date.

One morning, at about the sixth month of ownership, the car had difficulty starting.  It cost the wife a day of vacation from the job in order to have the problem analyzed.  Useless expenditure of a vacation day did not sit well with my wife.  However, we made it back to the dealership.  "Just replace the battery, and it will work.  I guarantee it.", says the maintenance manager.  He was right.

Then came Christmas of 2002.  It was actually an unusually cold time for the Houston, Texas area.  It had left a frost on the car.  I thought it would be nice to turn on that great rear window defroster and internal heater to remove the frost and save me any scraping efforts.  An attempt to start the car brought forth no fruit.  Nothing.  I was baffled.  Removing and replacing the battery with the one from the (still working) Chevy truck made no difference.  Now I felt a bit perturbed over the car&#146s performance, or lack thereof.  I called the towing number given to me by the dealership.  "Sorry, sir.  That warranty (and the tow) was canceled by the car&#146s previous owner prior to its sale.", says the service operator.  So, $35 later, a great local towing company delivered the car to the dealership for analysis.  Yes, I said, "Check it out, <b>and make it run."</b>  Can you believe my stupidity?  Check it out they did.  And, yes, it ran.  "What is the cost?", I asked the maintenance manager.  "Well, it only took a major tune-up, and it runs great.  Let&#146s see, the price?  Only $356."  I was on the scene, at the dealership, in the old (still running) Chevy pickup in about three minutes!

Smiles met me, keys in hand, and a major tune-up bill awaited my approving signature.  "What about my $50 deductible warranty?", I asked.  "Well, sir, this was not a mechanical failure of the car.  It is just normal maintenance due every 30,000 miles.  You should have had this maintenance done at the 60,000 mile mark.  Your car was sold with only 51,916 miles on it.  Now it has over 61,000 miles on it.", replies the maintenance manager.  "It is Christmas, maybe they will have a little mercy on my budget.", I thought.  Wrong!  $356 dollars later I drove the car home in a fume.  Where was I going to get the money for the kid's Christmas?  It was only days away.  Thanks to the faithfulness of our church the matter was more than met.  God is infinite in His mercy and grace - even for the stupid.  And we did have the car (bills and all).

Well, feelings subsided, forgiveness was joyfully given, and the experience continued.  We did notice the over drive button consumed a lot of gas in either the on or off position, and it seemed strange that the cigarette lighter held a false lighter cap instead of an actual lighter.  Even a man with severe coronary artery disease needs time, fasting, and prayer to stop smoking after 35 years.  I do need prayer.

The rear seat belts always tighten right up against the body.  Just take a deep breath, but do not try to exhale.  The rear seat belts will have already of made a tightening adjustment.  If you have anyone near six feet tall, do not invite them to sit in the back seats.  Leg room for my nearly six foot tall daughter does not exist, especially with the nearly six foot tall son in the seat just in front of her.  The front seats seem adequate; however, I am only five foot six inches tall.  Twenty eight inch leg lengths seem to fit nicely.  If you have any form of back discomfort, or real back pain problems, you will find the entire car way too low for entering and exiting.  Time certainly reveals the truth.

Holding the road is obtainable, as long as there is no wind.  I am pretty sure the tires are undersized, but the dealership says, "It comes that way from the factory."  Alright.  Do all Sentra models naturally come with there tires unaligned also?  It seems to need a front end alignment way too often.

I thought cup holders were a very nice addition.  I had never had cup holders in a vehicle.  However, I do not think the engineers realized that cups in front of the stereo system will not allow proper stereo operation.  In fact, while grasping a cup for removal, you will actually turn off the stereo system.  That is alright though.  It took me - a past computer technician for NASA, about a week to figure out how to program the stereo system and clock.  It seems the dealership never could get me an owner&#146s manual.

I do not use cruise control, but the car is easy to maneuver.  I like the electric mirror adjustment capability, and those power windows.  I think I just have a car with window switch problems on the driver&#146s side.  It seems the design of the car top allows rain to occasionally seep in, and the drops just happen to land on the window control panel.

The interior light is great.  Just avoid trying to see the ignition switch with it.  Your shadow will cover the space between the light and the switch.  The automatic stick shift is way too high for confident driving, an it is only $150 (parts and labor at the time) to replace the light bulb needed to read the stick shift panel.  It is a bit irritating, but I left mine dark after the bulb burned out.

I still recommend to my wife, that she sell the car for the balance of her Credit Union loan, take the financial and emotional loss, and start all over in a search for a car, or at least for a new dealership.

Well, just be sure to kick those tires before buying.  At least there was some pleasure in buying this automobile.  Not much, but some.  And I know reading this review has been torturous;  however, it is not nearly as bad of letting go of over $8000.

Lesson learned?  A twelve year old Chevy S-10 (still running at near the 200,000 mile mark) is a great fishing truck for the boy and I.
