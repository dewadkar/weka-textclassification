            Purchased new in spring of 1997, my Savana conversion van was the 5th full size GMC or Chevy van I've owned. The ride is excellent, like a luxury car. Reliable 5.7L V8 never caused a problem. It tows a 21' boat without straining. The wide-opening back doors are great. After 44,000 miles, it's still a great ride for long trips. Forward visibility is excellent and the new side mirror design is better than the old one. Spare tire is located behind the rear axle, where the gas tank used to be. Since the gas tank is moved up, the gas filler is now just behind the drivers door and lining up with a gas pump is different.     

However, there's a few glitches...(compared to pre-1996 style) 

It took a while to get used to new seat and steering wheel position (closer to the door) and my left foot gets uncomfortable resting on the curving front wheel housing. 

This van goes through brake pads a lot faster than any of my prior vans (every 10,000 miles?).  

The gas gauge is acting up and won't register correctly below half way point. This caught me by surprise (ran out of gas....and I thought someone else was putting gas in it). 

Drivers window control won't always send the glass back up (pop the module out of the arm rest, jiggle and then it's ok for a while).   

Since mine is a conversion van, I can't comment on the standard Savana interior or wheels.   <br><br>
