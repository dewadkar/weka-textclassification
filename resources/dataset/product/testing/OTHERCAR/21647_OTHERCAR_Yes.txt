            First of all I purchased this vehicle because I wanted a classy, modern and reliable car.  I chose the 2.3 CL because the price was very affordable and the interior of the car was beautiful, not to mention it's sleek outer looks and agile body. 
I appreciate how this car drives, it's handling on turns is impeccable. Driving on the highway is easy, smooth and quiet, you feel total tranquility. Inside the vehicle, you feel relaxed and comfortable because of the roomy interior. I also applaud the large trunk space and handy opening from the trunk to the back seats. The gas mileage is reasonable and the power of the engine is sufficient.  My dislikes are minimum, with just the complaint of wanting more torque when I switch gears and a little cramped seating in the back. 
Driving this car is effortless and fun. The brakes are decent and the performance surpasses other subcompact cars. Long drives are not a problem and is very comfortable. 
I recommend this car the the aspiring career goers who want a refined vehicle but don't have enough funds to go all the way yet. To those people who want a eye turning car which other people will be envious of, this car is for you.  If you like supple and smooth leather and comfortable interior seats, you can't pass this car up.  This car is not for the shy nor the timid, it is for the outgoing and extrovert personalities. <br><br>
