            I purchased a 1996 Chevy Blazer 4x4.  This SUV rides rough, corners poorly, and has many other glitches.  Since I bought it there have been many recalls.  The brakes have always been a problem, locking up, not stopping correctly, and even a recall on them.  The gas mileage could be better.  The handling is lousy.  The 4 wheel drive doesnt do any better for you on slick roads or snow than the 2 wheel does.  It has poor traction control. It is not very roomy for an SUV.  The interior armrests pop up continuously.  It creaks a lot when driving.  I think I could have bought a better SUV for the money I spent.  It does drive nice on trips.  The power seats are nice, but many vehicles are becoming equipped with them now.  You can get more for your money.  Maybe they have improved the new 1999 or 2000 models.  I would consider checking them out.  However, I think they are definitely overpriced for this vehicle.<br><br>
