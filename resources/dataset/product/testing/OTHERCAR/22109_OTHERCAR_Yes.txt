            I got this model because of the price and some reviews I had read. Its not the best or the fastest but for the price it has the most features and highest resolution I could find at the time - my one feature requirement was that it have an LCD. 

I would recommend getting a larger compact flash card and flash card reader shortly after purchase, as the serial cable it comes with takes a long time to transfer files, and depletes the camera's batteries as you do it!

The quality is great, and the resolution is (just barely) considered mega-pixel. For just shooting pix for a web site or on-screen only it more than suffices, and the quality is still very good printing out at 1400x1400 on my Lexmark z-51 color inkjet. 

The built in LCD works well, but depletes the batteries (4 AAs) at an alarming rate. Keep it off for normal shots.

Once I got the 16MB compact flash card and card reader, I was more than pleased with this camera.<br><br>
