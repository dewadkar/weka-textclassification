            When I started searching for my first car, I went straight to the Honda company. I liked the Civic style the best. But the next choice was 4 door or 2 door. Thinking of all the people that will be riding in my back seat I went with the 4 door sedan. While riding in my new 2000 Honda Civic I rolled the windows down and turned up the radio. Although my Honda is an LX without moon roof or key-less entry, I still like it. If I could go back to when I bought my Honda I would have made some different decisions. I would have gone with a 5 speed LX with moon roof and key-less entry. When you think about the money you would save getting a 5 speed you can go all out for the little perks that just add to a great car! Honda is very reliable! I would strongly recommend any kind of Honda to anyone who doesn't mind just driving on the road... driving off the road in a Honda doesn't work too well.
