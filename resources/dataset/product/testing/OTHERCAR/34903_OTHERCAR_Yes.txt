            Not that this Van is by any means small, but all the other Van's, (and I test drove them all), felt like I was driving a bus!  The way that the Honda handled and the powerful V6 engine handled hills, the design and layout of the front seat, made you feel like you were in a luxury car.  I told my husband that I had to look in the rear view mirror to fully comprehend the length of this van!  Now that may be a con to some people.  Never driving a van before, I did have one some difficulty backing this vehicle out of my drive way.

I was also one of those people, who was too cool, (or just not thinking), to by a van, but when our baby was due last January, we looked at many vehicles.  For the $'s there were no other Vans that gave us as much.  We could have went for a mini van but what was the point.  They all drove like they were not made as well.  The stability of the Honda made me feel immediately safer.  It just feels and drives like a &quot;well made&quot; vehicle.

We have had some minor problems with the paint marking quite easy; would recommend the paint protection package, either dealer or after market.  <br><br>
