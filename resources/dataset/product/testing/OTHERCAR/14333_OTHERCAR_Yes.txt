            The '92 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is my very first car. I bought it from a very close family member who had finally decided that it was time she could get a new car... and didn't actually need to give it up. I couldn't be happier, because it's perfectly reliable and in excellent condition.

It's a four-door, dark blue, with a/c and cruise control, both of which work great. The windows are electric and so are the backs of the front seats, which makes it very comfortable. There's plenty of room for five people, and no one is cramped for space. Even the trunk offers plenty of space for whatever you're carrying. However, the car is not big and bulky; it's just the right size. The doors lock automatically but don't unlock, which does catch you off guard at first but is easy to get used to. There's also the radio and a cassette player which provide good sound.

Because it's summer, I haven't had the chance to try out the heating system yet, and that will be important because the weather gets pretty cold around my area; the winter will be the real test. However, I had ridden in the car many times prior to my purchase and I don't expect any problems.

Don't get me wrong, there will be problems eventually; after all, the car is nine years old and things will need to be replaced after a while if I want to keep it running smoothly. I am also well aware of the car's history... it's got plenty of miles on it and it's seen a few deer accidents as well. Still, it runs without a hitch and I have never seen it stall or hesitate to start. If you are lucky enough to get a model that has been in such good care, you will feel the same as me in expecting to have your Cutlass Ciera for a long time.
