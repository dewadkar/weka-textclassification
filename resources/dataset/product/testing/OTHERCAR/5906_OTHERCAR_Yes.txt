            I just began college in upstate NY so the car is mainly for my use in school (yes freshman are allowed cars in my school).  We get massive snow storms often so I got the car to prevent frostbite from walking all over the place and to have my independence from relying on others for rides everywhere.  I absolutely LOVE this car! Of course the fact that I've wanted a Volkswagen from the first time i saw the cars attributed to this affection but it's truly a great car. No matter how much snow is on the roads I have no problems controlling my car. In fact, in the 4 months that I've owned it, it's already gone nearly 5000 miles and survived through some crazy road conditions. I took it down to New Jersey through a blizzard and had absolutely no issues with sliding around on the road. 

Initially it's very touchy on the break pedal but what do you expect from a little speed demon that can rev up to 40 in a mili-second?! If you want a sporty car that's fairly small but has a roomy interior this is DEFINITELY the car to have. It has a sleek exterior look that misleads everyone to think it's very small but in fact everyone who's had the privilege to ride in it has commented on the roomy interior. Of course you can't fit in any giants in the back seat (mine is a two door) but the driver and passenger seats are very cozy. You can adjust the wheel to your comfort and the seat can be pumped up to sit higher and the back can be rotated to lean more back or be very straight.  

The engine is practically silent...sometimes I don't realize the car is really on.  For music lovers like me, the sound system is AMAZING i believe its a 5 speaker system (practically surround sound). It'll make your window boom with the sound of your favorite tunes! The only set back I ever have is feeling like I'm barely moving when I'm doing 40mph.  Cruise control is a definite plus for fast drivers like me. 

If you're thinking about buying one, i highly suggest a test drive at a dealer and good luck and enjoy it!<br><br>
