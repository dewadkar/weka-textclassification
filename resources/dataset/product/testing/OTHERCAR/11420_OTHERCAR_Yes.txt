            We bought a 1980 4 Wheel Drive Toyota in 1980. We put a camper on the back and drove to Key West,Florida. We got Great Gas Mileage. This truck still runs like a top and boy does it have the miles on it. Never any mechanical problems. I really think this is the best truck we ever bought.
In the winter when nothing else could drive in the snow we could go. In fact my husband went out and drug people out of ditches, took medicine to people who needed it. This proved to be a very reliable emergency vehicle.
Our Grandson will soon be 16 and he wants this truck. He wants to use it for hunting. I would recommend this truck to anyone. It doesn't have a lot of space in the cab, but otherwise it is Great!<br><br>
