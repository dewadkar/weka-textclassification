            I drove a 2-door Sidekick as a rental car and might as well have pedaled with my feet, like Fred Flintstone. I dubbed it the &quot;Barbiemobile.&quot; It felt like a piece of plastic meant for a child or a doll, rather than an adult. I couldn't get it to go more than 20 mph uphill. The thing is, it looks like a little truck or sport-utility. No one expects, say, a Geo Metro to go very fast, but in the Sidekick I literally had people behind me honking and flashing their lights in my rear window, thinking I was dawdling along from sheer cussedness. It does drive about the speed limit on freeways, once you get going.
The Sidekick supposedly gets great gas mileage, and it looks - there's no other word - cute. It might be a good buy for parents with young teenagers, because it looks sporty but enforces, by default, driving at or below the speed limit.<br><br>
