            I'm very sorry that I got this camera for 250$ last year... I feel I was ripped off big time. First of all, allow me to continue by explaining how the camera looks....

It appears to be an abnormally large piece of crap, although I may be wrong. Yes it is user-friendly, but I don't think users should be treated with the terrible resolution that the Casio so kindly provides.

Saving 96 pictures on the camera would be a great feature... if you could store them at higher resolutions. It's no surprise that Casio's digital camera allows so many pictures to be stored; the poor resolution results in a small size of the picture files.  Also, when porting these pics to a PC they look even worse than they did on camera!

When taking pictures in the daylight with the QV11 you usually get a nice greenish tint on your photos due to the sun's rays being introduced into the cameras low quality lens. Taking pictures at night is also impossible due to the lack of a flash.

Personally, I can't wait until I get a new camera. As a beginner I figured I wouldn't need a higher quality camera for an extra couple hundred bucks. I was definitely wrong. While you may think that the higher quality cameras are only for the pros, you're mistaken. The poor quality found in Casio's QV-11 is all too noticeable. The QV-11 is definitely one of the worst digital cameras available.<br><br>
