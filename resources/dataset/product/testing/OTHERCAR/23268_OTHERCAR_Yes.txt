            When I took a part-time job in a town 45 miles away my wife and I decided that I should look for "a little truck to beat up and down the road." After a few weeks of searching I found a fair priced '91 S-10 with 150,000 miles on it. The whole idea was for this vehicle to be "Daddy's truck" for me to drive back and forth and carry things as needed for my part-time job. For awhile it became our only family vehicle when our other car broke down and spent a few weeks in the shop.

I have been fortunate to have nothing major go wrong with the truck. In the 6 months I have owned it I have put about 10,000 miles on the truck and spent about $200 in repairs. After about the first 5,000 miles the u-joint was beginning to squeak and a mechanic friend replaced them for me for a few bucks and parts. I have also had the fuel injection regulator go out (the mechanic informs me that these "never go out" and replaced it with one from a unit in the junk yard for, again, a few bucks and parts. Other than routine maintenance I have found the truck to be reliable, easy to ride in, and very work friendly. It carries what I want, has pulled a trailer full of football equipment 300 miles roundtrip, and got me back and forth to my part-time job all summer with no problems.

If you are looking for a little truck to drive around, for your child, or as a spare vehicle this is a good choice. I'd recommend it to anyone who may need a truck.
