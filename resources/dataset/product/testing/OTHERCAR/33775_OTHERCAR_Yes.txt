            This car is a 4-door luxury car that performs like a sports car.  The straight line 5 cylinder motor made for this car performs beautifully.  Plenty of pep and at top speed,  the ride is quite and smooth.  Very comfortable to drive and ride in.  With stock stereo that sounds great.  The anti-lock braking system performs as expected (unlike other makes of the same year).  If you are looking for space but don't want to compromise performance,  this is the car for you.  I feel in love with this vehicle the first time I saw one.  The looks are classy and sleek.  This car is family approved and kid tested.  But,  also fit the single man who likes to impress.  This vehicle maybe hard to find.  People tend to hold on to one when they get it. Good luck finding one.  <br><br>
