            I went home to visit my parents, and they bought a new 2002 four cylinder Honda Accord. My parents love Japanese imports; fuel efficiency and blandness is definitely on their list of priorities. This Accord has automatic windows (thank goodness), auto doors, a sun-roof, but manual seats. It does not have ABS or traction control. During my visit, I was drove this vehicle for the entire weekend, so I do have a pretty good feel for it, and here are my observations.

The first thing I noticed was�well, I didn�t really notice. My parents had to point that the Accord in the airport parking lot. The accord is certainly not a car that stands out. It screams (perhaps �whispers� is more accurate) blandness.

Then you enter the car, and you notice the gaudy center console. My goodness, I feel like the controls were haphazardly thrown all over the place. What is it with Japanese manufacturers and their �speed-racer� mentality? Every car they produce look like it�s designed by, and for, 13 year olds. Granted, the console isn�t nearly as bad as the one on the Lexus IS-300, but it�s still disconcerting. It can�t just be a price thing�Volkswagens are pretty cheap, and their interiors always seem very �adult�.

Then you drive off, and you notice how flimsy the steering wheel is. The wheel is large and thin, making me feel like I�m driving a bus. A little extra grip on the wheel would be much appreciated.

I then try to pull into an intersection, floor the gas, and the engine starts revving. But I have no power! Just as the engine gets a bit of kick, the transmission upshifts! At slightly above 3000 RPM! And this thing red lines over at over 6000 RPM! Ditto with downshifts�it�s similarly brain-dead. Whoever designed this transmission should be shot.

Handling? Forget it. High speed lane changes caused enough body shake that I backed off very quickly. There�s simply not the confidence that you get by driving, say, a VW.

On the plus side, the sun roof was nice. It�s nothing extraordinary�just a plain sun roof. It did make me wish I was driving my convertible instead.

This car is a very good economy sedan. Buy it if you want cheapness and efficiency, but be prepared to give up performance and fun.
