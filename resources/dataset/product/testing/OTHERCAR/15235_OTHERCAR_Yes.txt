            Before I bought my 97 Acura Integra LS 3 door, I owned a '85 rabbit.  I didn't know what power and performance were until I got into my brand new blue integra.  I didn't shop around, I knew the car I wanted.  I had thought about the trendy Honda Civic, or Accord, but my friends had those, I wanted something sportier. I bought a stick shift, just because I had never owned one before, and I thought it would be fun.  Although my car is three years old, it still seems new. 
Pros:  Comfortable ride, Moon roof, Cruise control, fast, but not too fast and fun.
Cons:  Not enough room in the back seat for most adults, can't turn off the airbag for smaller front seat riders.<br><br>
