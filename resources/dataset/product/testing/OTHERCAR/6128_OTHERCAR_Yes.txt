            My wife and I were shopping for a vehicle that would be comfortable to make 500-600 mile trips in, and would provide good fuel economy.
We looked at several different makes and models and while at the local Chevrolet dealership we discovered the Impala on the showroom floor. We were not aware this vehicle was being manufactured. We took the vehicle for a test ride and were sold. We purchased the vehicle 2/16/2000 and have been totally satisfied with it. It rides and handles smoothly and the fuel economy on highway trips has been as high as 29 mpg. Town and highway combined average 24 mpg. We are 100% satisfied with this vehicle.<br><br>
