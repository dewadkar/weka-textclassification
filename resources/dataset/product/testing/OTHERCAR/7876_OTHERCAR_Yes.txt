            We bought a 1997 Avalon from a Toyota dealer after falling in love with our parents' 1996 Avalon. For the past 1.5 years, we have truly enjoyed it and it hasn't given us any mechanical troubles.

The ride is very quiet and smooth. Our Avalon cost us less than $20,000 used and has leather seats, a sliding sunroof, and a CD/cassette player. The seats are comfortable enough for long trips and have adjustable lumbar and tilting headrests. The vast legroom in this car amazes our passengers every time. 

The clearcoat on the driver's side door handles flaked off this year and we had them repainted at a cost of about $100. Also, the radio reception is weak, and I was told it was because the antenna is built into the rear window and wasn't designed well. 

Having ridden in a friend's Lexus, I can honestly say -- it feels and looks like the same car! Of course, the Avalon is thousands less, and probably costs less than a Lexus to repair. 

We did rear-end a pickup truck at a very low rate of speed (less than 10 mph) and though it did no damage to the truck, there was over $3,000 worth of repairs to our car, including a new hood, headlights and bumper. So be sure you've got good insurance, as parts are clearly expensive!
