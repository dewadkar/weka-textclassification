            I'll admit it, right up front: I'm not much of an expert on cars. I came to driving late in life, not even getting a license till I was 37 or so, and until my recent purchase of a new VW Beetle, mostly all I've owned has been ancient rusty Toyotas, with the odd and equally rusty Subaru or Volvo thrown in for comparison. But I have driven my fair share of rental cars, and while I may not be the final word on automobiles, I sure know what I like to drive.

Or, in the case of this little rented Chevy Cavalier, what I <I>don't</i> like. I rented this nice-enough looking car very cheaply from Enterprise (where we get a discount rate because of my husband's affiliation with Cornell) for a recent 4-day trip to Philly, a city where I'd never driven before and didn't want to risk the safety and well-being of my brand-new Bug. It <i>looked</i> fine - "silver" (aka grey), clean, moderately comfy at first (though not for long, I was soon to discover), only 2000 miles on it. My first clue that this was a real entry-level car was when the rental agent was giving me the "walk-through" (why do they do that? And why do they call it that?) - it had no tape deck, no CD player, only a radio. I can't recall the last time I've seen a car without at least a tape player! 

"Well, OK", I think, "this is an inexpensive rental, of course you're gonna get a stripped-down model". But still - no tape player?! Manual window control, manual locks, even a manual gas port cover (I'd never heard of that, either). The wipers worked quite well, as did the windshield-squirter. Best feature? The air conditioning was good! That may sound frivolous, but I can't tolerate heat, and the Northeast was just settling in for a nasty streak of the big Triple-H - Hot, Hazy, and Humid - so this was a not-inconsiderable blessing.

The comfort of the seating in front (we didn't check out the back seat at all) was just so-so; OK at first, and less so as the 5-hr. trip wore on. Certainly less comfy than my VW, or our old recently-departed Toyota Camry, or any of the cars I test-drove in my search for a new car. No vanity mirror on the visors, no comfy place to stash a bag of gumdrops for the road, just the most basic of basics.

But let's talk about what's <i>really</i> important in a car: this car drove like the proverbial sardine can! Its engine was loud and crappy-sounding (a technical term, I know - please bear with me!), and it stopped, started, and changed speeds with a jumpy, lurching motion that I found really disconcerting. When I stepped on the "go" pedal (another techie term), it would hesitate for a split second, then lurch forward in a way that felt uncontrolled; the same happened when I braked - first nothing, then an abrupt stop. All this lurching and under/overreaction made this car aggravating to drive both on the highway and in the city; it didn't make what should have been small, quick corrections or changes quickly or effectively, and at times this made it feel downright unsafe. Lane-changing on a rush-hour highway, for example, was far more nerve-wracking than it needed to be, since the car didn't respond smoothly and instantaneously to my steering. 

Although I spent many hours driving this car, I never did get used to the Cavalier's habit of lurching around abruptly and seemingly poorly-controlled. One thing I <i>did</i> decide, however, was that I would never buy a car that handled like this; it may be cheap (I don't actually know what it sells for), but its handling certainly doesn't give a driver the feeling of solidity and  trustworthiness that I look for. It was noisy and lurchy - reminded me a lot of going around with a hyperactive three-year-old. I don't recommend it; surely even those looking for an inexpensive small car can do better than this!

<i>Addendum: I just noted that Epinions lists the Cavalier's estimated price as $13,746. As I recall, the Toyota Echo that we looked at recently was around the same price, and the Toyota was a far, far better car both to drive and to ride in. So check around if you're looking for a low-cost new car - you can do way better than this!</i>
