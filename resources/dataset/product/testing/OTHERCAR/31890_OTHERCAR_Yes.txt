            My husband bought a used Buick Regal about 4 years ago. My husband loved the car. He had very little problems with the car.  As a matter of fact when we traded the car had over 130,000 miles on it. We had it in the shop only a few times. Now this car did not like me at all so I did not drive it that much.  It seemed that whenever I did drive it something went wrong with the car. I was pregnant at the time and had 2 other children(so I wasn't in the happiest of moods whenever I was stranded on the side of the road). Everything that happened to the car was only minor and usually cost less than $100 to repair. In my opinion if the car likes you then you will have no problems but beware if the car doesn't like you be prepared to be stranded. <br><br>
