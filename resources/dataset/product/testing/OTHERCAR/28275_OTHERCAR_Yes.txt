            I traded my 98 caravan in and bought my dream mobile a purple Durango SLT plus with every bell and whistle known to man. 
I needed something that would haul 4 kids and groceries, we also haul a boat, trailer and anything else we can think of.
 I love all the space in it and all the features. The radio controls on the steering wheel is my favorite option.
 This vehical has gone every where. We go to the lake, we go and view real estate with it which can be tricky when its old abandon homesteads with grown up brush and sprouts, or an occasional creek running through the land.
 The best thing I can say about my Durango is that it is the best SUV on the market as far as safety is concerned, Me and the kids come home from shopping and we were on the gravel road home and we hit some loose gravel, I lost control it ran up an embankment and flipped over landing on the roof. 
I was frightened, But there was not a scratch on any of us, $18,000.00 worth of damage to the Durango (my poor baby) but it kept all of us safe, I think anyone who is concerned with their families safety should own a Durango, and everyone else should just have them because they are the best looking and running SUV out there.
Hats off to Dodge!!!  <br><br>
