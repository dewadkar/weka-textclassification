            We bought our MDX on November of 2000 when it first came out.  It was very hard to find a dealership that is willing to sell it to you at MSRP.  We basically paid about $1500 over MSRP but we got to choose the color we wanted and the accessories we wanted.

We got the base model with running boards, roof rack, tailgate deflector, moonroof visor and rear mud guards.  This alone made our MDX stand out from others.  

We recently took a trip to the mountain and had a chance to drive it through some snow.  The 4wd system on the MDX performed flawlessly.  It also has alot of power when going up steep inclines.  Surprisingly, the MDX handles VERY WELL, especially going sweeping turns at high rate of speed.  The 5 speed automatic transmission gear selection is perfect for the MDX.

The interior is very roomy and the seats are very compfortable.  The front seats are side bostered and the middle row seatback can be adjusted.  The rear seats are very easy to fold up and down.  It seats 7 comfortably.  The 3rd row seats is perfect for kids, but for short trips of less than one hour, full grown adults could managed to stay comfortable.

The stereo system is better than the one that comes standard on the 3.2 TL.  It has a large subwoofer and 2 additional tweeters by the front mirrors.  

Motor Trend did not pick this to be their SUV of the year for no reason.  We are very happy with it and if you have kids, it will make it even better.
