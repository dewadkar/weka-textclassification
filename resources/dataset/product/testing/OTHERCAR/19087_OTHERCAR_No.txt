            Note: We purchased our <b>1997 Kia Sportage</b> just shy of 4 months ago. Obviously, we purchased it used. I do NOT know if the problems we have had are problems every <b>Kia Sportage</b> owner has or not. This is what has gone wrong for us in the short time we have owned it, with some technical info tossed in for good measure.

We wanted an SUV. We saw a couple at a local car lot, so we stopped and looked. Our credit just shy of sucks, so getting financed was a trick in itself. Finding something in the right price range was also a trick. We finally found a decent looking SUV. Our <b>1997 Kia Sportage</b> is a teal color, and has 4 doors. It is a 4-speed automatic, and is a 4 wheel drive. It also had a roof rack, even though we didn't think we'd ever use it.

When my husband test drove the <b>Kia</b>, our son was sleeping in the car and no way was I going to wake him up, He liked it. The gas gauge was on "E", so the dealer gave him $3 to put some gas in it. Have you checked prices? At $1.80, or so, a gallon, that didn't buy much. My husband tootled around and came back. He liked it. We decided to buy it.

We obviously ended up with a basic <b>Kia</b>. The radio was a cheesy radio from Wal-Mart or someplace similar. Obviously a cheap after-market one. It came with AC, and that is about it. No cruise or anything. It has power locks and power windows, however. 

Taking it home, I drove, so my husband could drive his <a href="/auto-review-C93-460E96DE-3A4D661B-prod3">Civic</a>. Immediately I found that I should have test drove it, since it was to be my vehicle. While I trust my husband's judgment, he is taller than I am. I am a whopping 5'3" tall. Since I had to move the seat up, he didn't have the same problem I did. Down on the right side, mounted on the hump in between the seats, and under the radio, are the gas door and spare tire release levers. They rub the back of my calf while I am driving. In town this isn't an overly big deal, but on long drives, it will be a constant irritation for short people.

When I got home, the gas light was on. We had easily burned thru the $3 worth of gas that we had been given. My husband took the <b>Kia</b> and filled the tank. That in itself was a trick, because the door doesn't want to open, even with the latch pulled. He had to take a key and pry it open. 

The inside isn't bad. The front seats have a decent amount of room, unless you have full-sized people in the back seat. They won't have any room if you don't slide forward. Since the only person in the back seat is our son, we put him in the middle in his carseat, so he has a little more room. We just get kicked in the elbows once in a while. Supposedly it can seat 5 people. They had better be short.

Three days after we took our new toy home the "Check Engine" light came on. Upset, we called the car lot. They called the place they have a contract with the repair their cars and we went right over. They plugged it into a scanner and it came up as a gas cap problem. I had never heard of this. They took off the cap, screwed it back on, reset the light, and it stayed off. We were on our way!

A few days later, it was on again. We called the lot, they called the repair place, we went back. Same story. Gas cap. They said that it might need replaced. They also said that the <b>Kia's</b> are known to have issues with the "Check Engine" light and the gas cap. Ever "top off" your tank when you're getting gas? Well, for some reason, the way the <b>Kia</b> is set up, when you top it off, some gas can run outside the tank and it tells the "brain" that there is a gas leak. Nice, huh? We had gotten gas the night we had stopped and they reset it the first time, so it took 2-3 days for the thing to decide there was a leak. There isn't one, but it thinks there is. The "Check Engine" light has been on since a few days after the this reset. We got tired of going in for it to be something stupid.

Exactly a week after we bought the <b>Kia</b>, I discovered an electrical problem in a most inconvenient way. My husband was taking his Civic to have a crack in the windshield repaired. I was following in the <b>Kia</b>, with our son. It was hot, and the AC in the Civic wasn't working. My husband, being a gentleman, wanted us to have the AC. Since we were running late, he left a few minutes before me. I strapped in our son and climbed in. I turned the key and the engine started. And that was it. Nothing else worked. No radio, no power windows or locks and no AC. The ABS, seat belt and airbag lights stayed on on the dash. The windows were up and I couldn't get them down. I had no way to reach my husband, as he had left his cell phone at home. I was supposed to follow him and pick him up. I decided that since it was only about 6 miles or so, we'd just go. I'd get there ASAP and let him decide what the heck was going on.

Wouldn't ya know? We hit every light red. I swear, there must be 20 lights between home and where my husband was. By the time we got there, both of us were covered in sweat. When we got there, I turned it off and left the door open to let some air in. My husband came over and I began to tell him what was going on. The guy that was fixing my husband's windshield said that he used to be a salesman for <b>Kia</b> and that the year <b>Sportage</b> we had, and a few surrounding years, were bad for that same problem. He said that he had countless customers bring theirs in with the same issues. 

When my husband got in, he turned the key, and the <b>Kia</b> started just fine. No problems. I was sure it just hated me.  

As a side note, my husband called a <b>Kia</b> dealership here and also in Indiana. While they denied the electrical problem being common, they both did confirm that quite a few people had issues with the "Check Engine" light and the gas cap and that it was caused by people topping off their tanks. We stopped topping it off, but the light kept coming on anyway, so I have no idea what the deal is.

Anyway, the <b>Kia</b> seemed to run ok. The following week, just over 2 weeks from when we purchased it, we went to Indiana on a 2 week vacation. We got exactly halfway when we stopped for gas for a second time. At a drive thru, my husband heard a knocking sound coming from the engine. We pulled into a parking space and my husband stuck his head under the hood. He shut it off while we decided what we wanted to do. It was almost 800 miles one way. Did we go home or continue and hope the stupid thing didn't break down? We decided to go on. When my husband restarted the <b>Kia</b>, it started, but we had the electrical issue again. He got mad, said some select cuss words, shut it off and restarted it. It was fine. Well, there was still a mild knock, but the electrical had worked itself out again. 

It only came with a 30 day/1000 mile warranty. Between the previous 2 weeks, and the 400 miles each way to get halfway to Indiana, The warranty was up. It was also very limited. No electrical was covered. We could drive all of the way back for nothing. Also, this was Saturday night. They would be closed until Monday. We would be over the mileage allowed, so we went on. Figured we would deal with it later if it broke down. As quoted from Scarlett O'Hara, "I'll go crazy if I think about that now. I'll think about it tomorrow."

About 3/4 of the way thru the trip, my husband asked me to drive to give him a break. There was no cruise control, so his leg was tired. He was trying to save me from driving, because of the two release levers that rubbed my calf, but he wanted to take a quick nap. No problem. We stopped for gas. The knocking had stopped. We fill the tank, yet again, and go on. My husband reaches for the release to lean the seat back a little so he can rest. Nope. The seat wouldn't lay back. He fought with it, cussed some more, but it wouldn't budge. It was stuck in the straight up position. 

We finally made it to Indiana. By now we are both seriously hating this <b>Kia</b>. The "Check Engine" light was still glaring at us. We also had been watching our gas mileage. A 4-cylinder. It should get good gas mileage, yes? NO! We were getting a whopping 21 MPG on the highway and 12 MPG in town. It cost us more than we had figured on. Even the <a href="/content_56536174212">Taurus</a> got better gas mileage and we thought it was a gas hog!

About halfway back to Virginia, we stopped at a rest stop. My husband was driving, so I asked him to stop. I got out and shut my door. The door lock, on the outside near the handle, fell in the door! There are only two ways to get in the <b>Kia</b>. The front doors have outside locks and then the hatch, but you have to pull the release from the inside to release the spare tire on the back. With the passenger side lock now in the door somewhere, the only way in the <b>Kia</b> is thru the driver's side door. If something happens to that lock, we're in trouble! The back doors don't have locks on the outside. I had just shut my door, not even slammed it. By now we were both over it. We were ticked, but just added it on to the list of things we hated about this vehicle. 

Oh, it gets better! 

We finally get home. The next night my husband has to work. It's Sunday night. He gets off of work at 7am Monday morning. He gets halfway home and it starts to rain. He turns on the windshield wipers. The driver's side one stops working! It won't go up! When it does finally catch, the passenger side one if totally up, stopping the driver's side one from going up at all. Well, not true. It will go flying when the wind catches it just right. Often it gets thrown over and rests on the driver's side door mirror. Since there is some room between the window and where the windshield wipers go, when the wind catches it, if it doesn't fly all of the way over, it will stop right in the middle of the glass. You have to stop to put it back down.

We had had it, so when Hurricane Isabel came thru, we were hoping she would take the <b>Kia</b> for a spin around Virginia Beach. Heck no! Even she didn't want it! We had taken the Civic to evacuate, using a <a href="/content_114587373188">cargo carrier</a>, because we wanted to save the Civic and hope the Kia was gone. It was fine, sadly enough, when we got back a few days later. Well, not fine, but in the same condition.

These may be nit-picky problems, but they are issues we have had to deal with. We now have a, roughly, 3000 lb paper weight. Neither of us will drive it unless we absolutely half to. It has a rough ride, feeling like there are no shocks and that it will tip around curves, and next to no power. Pulling out in front of people is a big no-no. You'll get hit. The "pick up and go" is gone.

The problems that we have had may not be issues with every <b>1997 Kia Sportage</b>, but it has been enough of a pain that there is no way we would purchase another one. The newer ones are supposed to be better, but I don't know if I want to find out.
