            and take care of her you'll never find a better car.  We own a 1996 Cavalier Z24.  We bought this car because this car exceeded our expectations in the areas of acceleration and handling.  It has a cute sporty look, and a firm feel for the road.  At 60,000 miles all we have had to replace is a water pump.  We have also received three recall notices from Chevy for various problems.  The biggest problem I have with this car is the placement of the cup holder.  It is placed between the shifter and the dash.  You can not put anything in it if you want to drive the car.  This is a fun car to drive, the suspension is a little bit rough.  I would recommend this car for younger, inexperienced drivers.  It is a very easy car to drive.  Interior room is a bit cramped limiting some people from being able to drive comfortably.<br><br>
