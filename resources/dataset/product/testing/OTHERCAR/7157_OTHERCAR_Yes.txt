            I liked the looks of this truck.  Unlike the old S-10's, starting with the 1998 models, these trucks are more comfortable that the forerunner.  The interior was roomy, and all of the &quot;gadgets&quot;, radios/cd, windows and locks were very handy and easy to operate from the drivers seat.  The best new addition was the headlight system, I owned this truck for 2 years and never had to turn the head lights on or off, therefore, there was never a worry about the battery running down.
The sound system was very good.  The truck rode a lot better than the older models.
I was very satisfied with this vehicle and I believe everyone who has doubts about buying this type of truck should reconsider and give a try.<br><br>
