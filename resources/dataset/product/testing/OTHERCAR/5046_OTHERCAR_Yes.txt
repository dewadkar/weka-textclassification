            My husband and I were in the market last year for a new car. I had always wanted a convertible, but we never got one because we do not have a garage. I finally convinced my husband, to go down and take a look at the convertibles at the Mitsubishi dealership.

Immediately, my husband fell in love with the Mitsubishi Spyder 2001. I was not with him at the time that he was looking at it because he did it on his lunch break. Later that night, my husband came home and told me how wonderful the car saleman was and that I should go down with him and take a look at it.

I have always loved the Mitsubishi 3000 GT, so he didn't have to ask me twice. We made plans to go down on Saturday since I did not have to work that particular Saturday. 

When we got there, the saleman greeted us, remembering my husband. He was very nice to us and took us out to check out the car. There was a whole row of Spyders. He got the keys to one of them and we went for a ride. We fell in love!

I had to make a decision, which color did I want? My husband let me pick the color of the car. I had a difficult decision since there were so many different colors to choose from: red, black, white, silver, green, burgundy, etc. I finally decided on the silver with the black top.

As for interior, the car has black leather seats. They are very comfortable in the front. I have had the misfortunate of having to sit in the back of my own car and can understand how uncomfortable that is. There is not too much room in the back, but if you must, you can squeeze two people in the back seats.

The car comes with a 5 disc changer. I have had some problems with this. After playing a cd a few times, it tends to skip throughout the song. I have taken this problem to the dealers and they have told me it is do to a scratch on the cd. My only problem with believing this is, the majority of the cds that this has happened to are some of my newer cds.

We did not get the standard shift, since I do not know how or care to know how to drive the standard shift. Our car is automatic and has a hybrid shift to make it go faster, sort of like a pretend standard shift. Just step on the gas, and this car moves.

The car is also equipped with power door locks, power windows and an anti-theft system. I have not had any problems with these features. I have had a problem with the trunk latch on the side of the driver's side. I tried to open it one day and it did not open, I later learned there is some type of vallet feature that can be accidently shut off in the trunk making the trunk feature disabled on the side of your driver's seat. By the way, the driver's side seat is moveable by a button, but the passenger seat is not.

When going places, I prefer to have the top down. It provides a nice breezy ride. My back seat passengers, do complain when we are on the highway since they seem to catch the most breeze in the back of the car. I try to prevent the breeze by rolling the windows up, but I have heard rumours that this can later cause problems with the windows. 

When the top is up, it is a little more difficult to see out of the back window. There is only a small window in the back of the car, therefore, you have a blind spot. After awhile you get used to this, but the first few times I had to drive with the top up, I held my breath when I needed to back up or see on the side of me.

Besides having a nice cool breeze with the top down, you can elect to put the top up and feel the cool air conditioning. There are four vents that you can blow in either direction in the front of the car.

Do to the fact that the car is low to the ground, we have had a couple of problems with the front of the car. When going up driveways and entranceways, we have had the unfortunate experience of scraping the bottom of our car. In the snow time, I do not prefer to drive this car because it is low to the ground and it is a sports car.

At night, if you need to read a map or see something in the car, you can turn on the reading lights. There are two buttons on the driver's mirror that you can turn on. When the little white part of the button is showing, this means that the lights are on. Don't forget to shut them off, however, when you stop because you may waste your battery.

This car is pretty much a gas hog, but I don't have far to travel to work each day, so I can last on $20 a week for gas. I recently traveled to New Hampshire on a full tank of gas from Connecticut.

The overall price tag for our car was over $31,000, with free oil changes. It is a very sharp car and we get loads of comments. We can't even get down the street without hearing nice car.
