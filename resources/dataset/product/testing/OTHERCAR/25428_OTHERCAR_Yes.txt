            During April of 1998, I began searching for a cheap, yet dependable automobile.  After two years of the most pathetic excuse for transportation, my 1988 Jeep Wrangler, I wanted something that would get me from Point A to Point B for a very long time.  So after hearing the rave reviews about the dependability of the Saturn's I looked into it.  My choice quickly became the 1998 Saturn Sports Coupe.  This car has everything.  It's cheap, it's dependable, and the options are limitless. 
One of the best things about Saturn is the way they do business.  It's simple: no BS, no pushy salesmen.  You walk in you say, &quot;I like your car.  I want one.&quot;  They sit you down and give you a price list.  They have the base price at the top and under it is the price of every option that they have available.  You simply pick and choose exactly what car you want and they ship it in from wherever and you pick it up.  You just can't beat it.  Now, as for the particulars of the car.  It's a 4 cylinder with excellent gas mileage.  I get around 27 miles a gallon in the city.  27 miles!!!  That's unbelievable!!!  Mine is a 5 speed, with power windows, power locks, sunroof, and rear spoiler.  On my Saturn I ordered just the simple AM/FM radio because I knew I was going to put a CD player of my own in.  And that saved me money.  You simply can't beat this company's procedures, prices, service, and quality.
