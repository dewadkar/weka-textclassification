            My first new car! So what if I am 48 years old? And what have we chosen? A funny-looking little bug that the young car salesman kept referring to as "nostalgic"! It's been a family joke of sorts that someday I would get my Volksie Beetle; now Our Day has Come!

I've wanted a red Beetle, of course, ever since 1967 when I remember helping my best friend Luanne Zitt and her brothers decorate their red VW with lady-bug black-and-red spots for the Beatles' concert at Komisky Park (is that what it's called? Where the Cubs used to play?) in Chicago. Hip, weren't we? Boy, I'll never forget how I cried after that Beetle pulled off to the Beatles concert without me - my mother wouldn't let me go! Have you ever heard of such a cruel thing? Anyway...I came of age back in the '60s & early '70s, when the old Bugs were still crawling around, and I've passed many happy hours inside their funny little miserably cramped domes, back in the good old days. Oh, pardon me, I keep drifting off to the Glory Days of my mis-spent youth...

OK. Tomorrow I should "take delivery" (as they say at the car showroom) of my very own modern-day (and much-improved, I must admit) Beetle. Bright electric blue ("Techno blue", the brochure calls it) - I wanted that bug-green color, but alas, it was not to be found locally, so I'll have to settle for the vastly more conservative but no less cheerful blue. Well, compromise is the gift of maturity, I guess. What about the classic gleaming bright red? As I've eyed the new Bugs since they were revived a few years ago ('97, maybe?), I've decided that the red somehow isn't visible enough - it's a great red-red, far perkier than the old faded maroonish-red that most of the originals faded to, but it doesn't draw quite enough attention to itself. If I'm gonna have a funny-looking car, I want it to be a <i>noticeable</i> funny-looking car! A toy car, a Dinky car, a Matchbox car.

So how did we go to the dealer fully intending to replace our beloved and faithful old Toyota Camry with one of its sensible cousins and coming home with a purchase agreement for a Beetle? We drove it; we drove the Toyota Corolla and the Toyota Echo, we checked into the Golf & the Jetta, and - <i>mirabile dictu!</i> - the Volksie was the best, even though it cost more than the Toyotas.

My husband is over 6'6" tall (you can read about his adventures in test-driving the Echo in my review of that car). Fitting into little cars is not his best thing. Plus I may as well say it right up-front, he's a bit <i>stodgy</i>, as the Car Guys might say, a bit cautious, tending towards the wise-but-dull if left to his own devices. (Good thing he has me to keep him lively!) He wasn't too happy with the Echo, we didn't really need the size of another Camry, and the Corolla was OK with him; when we took the VW Bug out, though, he perked up considerably. We both love the way it handled, the "feel" of driving it, and the unexpected comfort and spaciousness of the front seat, for both driver and passenger. 

Notice I said "front seat". The less said about the rear, the better. His mighty dome was barely able to squish in back there, not to mention his legs - even my midgety little legs weren't all that comfy in back. But hey, we don't have to fit people in our back seat any more!

Back to the driver's seat: unbelievably roomy (well, for a small car)! Because of the slope of the front windshield, the dashboard stretches way out in front of you on the inside - I swear, I've had gardens smaller than the dashboard of this Beetle! I feel like I'm sitting in the dome of a little flying-saucer bubble (the kind we used to have back in the '50s, before space vehicles were scary-looking and sleek). Lots of leg room - even for Mr. Gigantical's lengthy limbs - not only in front of the knees, but around the sides too. He actually found that he had to move the seat up from its farthest-back position - I've never seen that happen before. (This is a man who, when he was trying to fit himself into a rental Chevy Citation or some such car, was once taken pity on by an observing rental agent and given a free upgrade to a Cadillac, just because he couldn't bear to watch the contortions.) The ride is comfy and smooth, much less bouncy than that of the Echo, and relatively quiet.

This car is easy and fun to drive. Well, at least by my standards - I'm no techno-turbo maniac; I just want a car that is responsive, easy to manage, stops and goes and does what it's supposed to do efficiently and without my having to think about it much. This car did great over our many and mighty Ithaca hills, and took our equally many and mighty potholes equably, with a minimum of fuss & feathers. Suffice it to say that no hemorrhoids were ruptured in the test-driving of this car! There didn't seem to be a lot of engine-churning as we took it through its various speeds and hills, either - it did its business unobtrusively and efficiently. The new Beetle no longer has that inimitable old-Beetle engine sound, though - probably a good thing, but I will never forget the distinctive sound of the old Volksies chuffing along the street. Not a whine, not a chug, just "that sound" of a VW Bug. The squirrels on a treadmill, we used to call it, the rubber bands unwinding...Hey, guess what? It also has a regular-sounding horn now! Mighty! No more the laughable little beep-beep.

I think the selling point, as far as my husband was concerned, was its safety record. It has both front and side airbags, and the car, little though it may be, feels <i>solid</i>. Non-tinky. Quality. The door "thumps", not "clinks", when you close it. Consumer Reports likes it, owners like it, and its one black spot in Consumer Reports is its "reliability record". Meaning how often it needs repairs; we're hoping that in the 3 years since the new Beetle came out, that will have improved some. Stay tuned - I'll let you know how this plays out! Has a good warrantee, though.

And did I mention the bud vase by the steering wheel? My daughter says she can just picture me, driving around the country singing, with fresh flowers always in the little vase. (I've already planned how I will carry water and some little snippers in the car with me, in case I chance upon some attractive wild blooms awaiting my capture.) Her other expression of excitement and happiness that I was actually getting my little Bug? "Oh my god, Mom, now everyone will know you're an old hippie chick! That's who drives those cars, you know!" No!?
