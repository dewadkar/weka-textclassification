            I really do love my ECHO!  I have a black 4 door, automatic, with the all weather package, upgrade package #1, air conditioning, and the 6 speaker cd/cassette stereo.  I get increadable mileage - roughly 38-40 mpg which includes both city and highway driving.  The car handles very well.  Yes, you do get blown around a bit in the wind, but it doesn't feel any worse than any other car I've driven.  I also don't really notice the &quot;roll-over&quot; effect that many people talk about.  Then again, I'm not a speed-demon.  I think that the 2 major complaints people have about the ECHO - 1) how it handles in the wind and 2) the roll-over feeling - are both compensated for by smart driving.  If one drives responsibly, one won't have a problem with either of these things.  

The space inside the car is fantastic.  The trunk is surprisingly huge.  Add to that the fact that the rear seats fold down and one realizes this little car can carry much more than it's outer appearance suggests.  

I'd also like to mention something my grandmother, who has oesteoperosis with 4 fractured vertibrae, said upon getting into my car: &quot;Wow!  Getting into this car is so easy!  I feel like I'm sitting in a chair.  When I get into your mother's car I feel like I'm falling on the ground!  And you have to go digging for the seat belt clamps in her car.  In yours they're as high as the seat!&quot;  I'm not sure what my mother's driving right now but I do have to agree with my grandmother that the ECHO is very easy to get in and out of - even for my 6'1&quot; boyfriend.

I don't think that people should judge a car based on what age group the car's advertisements are directed towards.  If you are looking for a comfortable small car that will carry lots of stuff, get good mileage, and comes from a reputable and reliable company, you should definately look at an ECHO!<br><br>
