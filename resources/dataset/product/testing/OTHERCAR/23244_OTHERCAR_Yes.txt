            If you like to live on the edge...and drive powerful sports cars...the 3000GT VR4 is the car for you. With 310-320 horsepower twin-turbo V6 under the hood, this car will take you into a whole new dimension.

Not only is the car quick, 0-60 in 4.9seconds with manual and around 5.2seconds with automatic, but it is also all wheel drive and all wheel steering. That means the best traction you can get, especially during the winter and during rain.

Pull up next to a Camaro or a 'Stang on a red light and you will have no fear, you will take them off the line and be happy for the rest of the day. The car debuted in the early 1990s and stopped being produced in 1999. This was a sad day for the car, because it truly was an amazing car and stopping its production seems like a nightmare. If you own one of these you're lucky, and you should take care of it. The car is pretty expensive, $45,000 brand new(VR4) and even now you can't pick up a nice 1996 for less than $25,000.<br><br>
