            The 2000 Jeep is wonderful.  It is much more powerful than it's predecessors.  It can tow just about any boat, camper, or anything else that you would want.  The gas consumption is low compared to other sport utility vehicles.

One problem that the older jeeps have is that the storage in the trunk area is minimal because the spare tire is stored there.  In the 2000 jeeps, the spare tire has been placed below the trunk for added storage space (large enough for a couple golf club sets).  The spare tire is still easily accessible through the trunk.

The 2000 jeep comes in two different forms of 4 wheel drive.  The first option allows you to manually put the jeep in 4 wheel drive when needed.  The second option has the jeep in four wheel drive all the time.  The Jeep's computer senses when wheels are slipping and will supply extra power to these wheels to avoid &quot;spinning out&quot;.  I greatly like the second option more than the first.  It allows the Jeep to take control in situations when you might not think quick enough.  It does it all for you.

The Jeep handles extremely well and drives very smooth so you feel like you are driving a luxury car, not a truck.

The only major disadvantage I found about this vehicle is that it only comes with an automatic transmission.  It is impossible to get this car with a standard transmission.  Personally, I prefer standard transmission cars because it allows me more power over the car.  However, most luxury cars today only come with an automatic transmission, so this is a disadvantage you would find with Jeep's competition as well.<br><br>
