            I've just enjoyed a wonderful week driving a brand new Daewoo Lanos 4 door sedan!! Equipped with the 1600cc,4cylinder, 16 valve engine it hauled along at highway speeds of 80mph+ without the least bit of effort-and it delivered 31+mpg with the automatic transmission!!
Rented from a dealer in Florida I opted for their economy model-the Lanos-yet it had all the toys necessary to make life in the Florida fast lane quite comfy-for a base model it left little to be added on. The AC proved to be a big plus and provided a level of comfort rivaling more prestigious automotive names!!
The Daewoo lineup boasts that it is German engineered but built in the Orient-and like all German steel I found it to be exceptionally roadworthy and stable at high speeds with power to spare! The Lanos is tight and quiet and provides lumbar,knee and tush adjustments capable of keeping even the most finicky driver/passenger in comfort.
The trunk swallowed up three huge suitcases,a toolchest and after lowering half of the split back rear seat-a 5 foot aluminum step ladder-awesome for a small car-after 1100 miles I felt bad parting company with it- Next week I'll be renting again-Yep- it'll be another Lanos!!!!!!<br><br>
