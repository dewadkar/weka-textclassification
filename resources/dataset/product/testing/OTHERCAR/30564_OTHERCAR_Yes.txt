            I was going to purchase the new Accord. Test drove the accord and the pilot. I liked the driving position and outward visibility of the pilot. The Variable Torque Management 4 wheel drive system for off road conditions made the pilot my choice. The ride is car like. The engine is very quiet and it provides plenty of power for a vehicle weighing it at over 4400 pounds. The acceleration is very good for an SUV. I have averaged 20 mpg driving in combined city and highway conditions. The fit and finish is quite good. I love the versatility of the pilot. It is roomy offering sufficient space for both passengers and their gear. My complaints about the pilot are few and are mitigated by the fact that I would have had to purchase an SUV costing thousands more to resolve most of them. The outside rear view mirrors fog up under certain driving conditions. Heated mirrors would have been nice. There is some road noise possibly caused by the quiet engine and tires. The navigation system has limited "mapping" for some locations on the North Olympic Peninsula. Many country road are not listed. Accessing the homelink function and cruise control system is difficult during very dark driving conditions. Neither the homelink nor steering wheel mounted radio and cruise control buttons are visible at night, causing one to feel around for the control buttons.
