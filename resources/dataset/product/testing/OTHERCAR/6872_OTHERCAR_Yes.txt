                 I recently purchased an Elantra in April of 1999.  I was drawn to the Hyundai because of the incredible warranty, and low pricing.  The first time I test drove the Elantra I fell in love.  I am only 5 feet 3 inches, and often have trouble with visibility in a lot of cars.  The Elantra is  wide open and has a minimal amount of blind spaces.  The car also has enough kick to make you feel like you could get somewhere quickly if you needed to.  My only difficulty with the initial purchase of the car is its popularity.  I was forced to wait two weeks to get my car, but in the end the wait was well worth it.
    Now that I have had my car for a few months.....I realize that I have made the best decision for me.  The car is reliable, economical (I average close to 30 miles to the gallon), and it looks pretty sporty with the spoiler.  (Sorry, I am not in love with the behind without it) I have also been continually impressed with my car's handling.  Not a sports car, but sporty enough for me.
