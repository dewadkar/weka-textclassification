            I was an owner of an S-10 pick-up.  The Tacoma caught my eye just by the look.  The sleek yet rugged look of the 4x4 STD equipped version was very easy on the eyes.  Next came the test drive, and this is when it got really good.  The four cylinder engine pumps out power compared to the 2.2 liter of the S-10.  Lots of power!  This was an experience the first time I took a load up the continental divide in Maryland and Virginia and my truck was pulling the hill at 65 in 4th gear (the S-10 managed 40 in 3rd). The only complaint about the truck is the cab space.  While it looks roomy on the outside, there seems to be less space then the S-10.  So if you are tall, don't bother with the truck.  Also, being a 4x4 the ride is kind of rough, maybe in part to the 265/75/r15 tires that came with the truck. But all in all, not one problem out of the vehicle at all.  Not one.  Any four wheel drive advocate...don't let this one get by! As not having driven the 2 wheel drive version, I can't really give an opinion as to the smoothness of the ride, as the 4x4 does ride a bit rough.<br><br>
