            When we decided to purchase the Chevrolet Avalanche, we had no idea how much the truck would interest our family and friends.  We fielded an "avalanche" of questions from everyone about this vehicle.  

THE DEAL:

Before Chevrolet came out with the Avalanche, we had been thinking (for quite some time) about buying a Tahoe.  When we think about getting a new vehicle (or new anything), we definitely put a lot of time into the decision.  It took us 5 years just to decide on the television we wanted!  So buying a vehicle involved alot of investigation.  When the Avalanche came to our attention, our interest was caught.  We found out about it on a website, since Chevrolet hadn't even started advertising them yet.

Our last truck was a 1988 Chevrolet Silverado.  The main reason we wanted to replace it was because we couldn't take the whole family anywhere with the truck.  Avalanche was the perfect solution.  We toyed with the idea of just getting an extended cab truck but this looked much more comfortable.  We definitely wanted a Chevy since the old truck is still going strong after all these years.

So, we went to the dealership and made a deal.  We were the first ones to have an Avalanche in this area.  Since they had 3 on the lot (mostly for show) and had 40 on the way, they decided to make money on the 40 and cut us a great deal.  We drove out with a new, fully loaded Avalanche and only paid $28,000 for it!

COMFORT:

Since the Avalanche is built on the Suburban frame, you can just imagine the smooth ride.  No more bumping and hoping around the cab of a truck!  It is just like riding on air.  The seats are roomy and comfortable, and we got the fabric covers instead of leather since we have little children and because it's too darn hot in Houston for leather seats!

Having plenty of air conditioner vents, cup holders, map lights, and storage spaces inside the cab was essential for our family of 5.  Lots of leg space in this truck and the adjustable lumbar support is great.

The only down side is the comfort of the back seats.  Unlike the "family" vehicles such as a van, those seats don't adjust.  So for a long trip (like the one we took to Orlando), the back seat passengers get a bit stiff.  Trying to take a nap sitting straight up is very uncomfortable.

THE "BUGS":

Anytime you get a new vehicle, there is likely to be a few bugs to work out.  Within a week, we discovered that one of the plastic panels wasn't attached correctly.  No problem, of course!  We took it back and had it repaired.  Someone must have been sleeping on the job when they built the vehicle.

Another problem is the unusual shape.  Since the hood is shaped differently, you have to get a special bug shield for the Avalanche.  But once it's installed, it creates a wind noise that's irritating.  The dealership said they could install an extra seal around the windshield that can take care of that.

The next thing we found was that the plastic that holds the back glass in place was broken.  When we contacted the dealership, they said that Chevrolet has gotten several reports of this occurring and had made changes to compensate.  So, once again we drove to the dealer and had another repair.  They replaced the plastic panel in an hour.

The only other problem we have encountered is storing the deck lid panels.  It sure looks easy on TV, except I don't think they are storing the panels in that flimsy bag that comes with the vehicle.  Trying to slide those into the bag and clip the bag into the cargo area is NOT a one person job.  At least not for us.  But this is a somewhat small annoyance that doesn't bother us too much.

FINAL ANALYSIS:

What can I say?  I LOVE THIS TRUCK!  It's not too bad on gas mileage, it's convenient as a truck or a "people carrier" and it's a sharp looking vehicle.  With all the storage compartments inside, and the storage in the bed and on the sides, you can definitely take all you need for a road trip and still not feel crowded.
