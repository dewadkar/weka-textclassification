            I purchased this automobile in February of this year.  I have already put close to 19,000 miles on it and I can tell you it is an exceptional ride for the price.  I have the ES edition with the black leather interior and the autostick.  The autostick is a great feature if used properly.  The 2.5 liter engine multi point fuel injection system has lots of juice.  It out performs most cars in its class, I know a certain other car company boasts its V6 is the best in its class but I disagree.  The drawback I have found with the car is gas mileage.  Most will buy the Stratus for its fuel economy, the ES edition is a gas eater.  And most wouldn't buy the ES since for the same price they can get the Intrepid.  But I truly enjoy the ride.  Supposedly the 4 cylinder is faster off the line than the 6.  I test drove both, the 6 smoked it.  I also test drove the Pontiac Grand Am and the Ford Contour.  The Dodge smokes it.  I highly recommend this automobile to anyone searching for a mid sized sedan that acts like a full sized sedan. <br><br>
