            SECTION I: written soon after purchase- 
This is an amazing car. Seating 8, it is perfect for your whole family. One of the safest cars around, you should feel no qualms about going for a family ride in it. Not only is the volvo safe, but it looks mighty nice too. With its streamlined hood and hacked off rear along with snazzy headlights, it will turn heads. There are a few problems with it though. The cup holder breaks easily. The seatbelts often hang out of the door, consequently when you shut it the door lights smash. Also, if someone tries to open the door as you press the unlock key, the lock on that door breaks. Other than that, it is a very reliable, safe, and altogether spiffy sort of car.

SECTION II: a year or so later-
This car has lost some of its appeal. Although it may just be the axle on this particular car, it has gotten an unbelievable amount of flat tires. In two weeks, about four were discovered and fixed, spaced a few days apart. Also, when involved in a fender bender with a taxi, although the other car received not a scratch, the whole left front of the volvo was dented, the headlight was shattered and the headlight-windshield wiper was bent. This was from but a tap. Other volvos may not have these problems,  but be wary!
