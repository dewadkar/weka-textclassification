            I bought this car because I needed a car to make it to and from work and I'm a single guy, so although I didn't want the 911 okay so I did sue me.  I decided on something a little bit more in my budget and bought the Acura Integra GS.  This car has a lot that a 20 year old could desire, speed, handling, a decent stereo system, but of course that had to go for a custom system.  The trunk isn't huge but it definitely will hold a Ten Inch Sub in a custom box two amps with ample room for luggage for that weekend getaway for two.  This car is made for between 1 to 4 people really, that fifth seat in the middle that so many cars have, well it just doesn't cut it except for quick jaunts to a party no more then 10 fifteen miles away.  This is a souped up Honda, if you can really say that. The engine has the Honda Mark on it, and I assume that some of the internal workings are like the Honda's, however the difference is like a puppy (the Honda) to an alpha wolf (the Acura).  The GS is the luxury style car leather interior, moon-roof, power windows and locks.  Okay before I am accused of being an Acura Dealer, I will list my complaints.  NO cup-holder,  I don't know about you but I like to be able to have my drink by my side and not in my lap especially when its really hot.  Second, its really light and if your going above the speed limit in most states there are unpredictable results.  However, if your going to be going faster then 85 not recommended, make sure you get some performance tires, and know the road and its conditions.  All in All I am very pleased with the purchase because of the minimal amounts of effort that I have to put into maintaining it compared to the extreme pleasure I receive from driving it.<br><br>
