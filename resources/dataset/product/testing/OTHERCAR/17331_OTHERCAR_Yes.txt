            As a recent college graduate, I have been waiting for months to buy my first new car.  For the last 3 years, I've been driving a real beater - an '89 Acura Integra.  Well, the Acura has served me well, but as a young professional I felt that it was time for a newer and  more attractive vehicle.   I've loved the VW New Beetle since its introduction in 1998, and in the end, it was the ONLY vehicle I test drove when searching for my new car.   

I purchased a 2003 New Beetle GLS 1.8T, with a Reflex Silver exterior and black cloth interior.  I got several options and option packages: Monsoon sound system, Cold Weather Package, and 17" alloy wheels.  

<b>Interior</b>
There is a lot of space inside the New Beetle.  Headroom is just not an issue, even for those taller than six feet.  The front seats are very adjustable, and the mechanism to move the seats forward is located towards the top of the seat, not down by the floor as in most other 2-door cars.  The floor is low, and it is extremely easy to get in and out of the vehicle - even getting in the back seat is no challenge for someone of normal size.  

The cloth interior is pleasant to the touch and does not become terribly hot, even in direct sun.   The front seats have good lumbar support, and all four seating positions have comfortable, adjustable headrests.  The rear seats fold flat easily to allow for a larger cargo capacity - however, cargo space is still somewhat limited.   There is storage in the front armrest/console, and there is plenty of room to keep my sunglasses and my work security badge in it.   The cupholders are a bit small and mostly useless.  

The plastics used on the interior are sturdy.  I really like the exterior-colored door panels, they add a nice touch.  The steering wheel and some dash surfaces have a rubber-like surface with a nice "dimpled" pattern.  However, the dash does collect dust - I have a small duster that I keep in the mesh pocket in the door. 

Where the New Beetle really shines is in the controls and gages.  The gage lighting is a beautiful combination of cobalt blue dials with bright red needles.  It is easy on the eyes at night and makes it easy to have essential information with just a glance.   The sunroof control is a simple dial that allows for 15 positions - from fully open to popped up in the back.  It's a one-touch control, so there's no need to hold the dial while the sunroof opens to the desired spot.   The clock and an exterior thermometer are located on the rearview mirror instead of the dash.   Trunk and gas cap releases are on the driver's door.  The wipers offer 6 different speeds.  Climate control is via large, easy to use dials and offers 4 different airflow direction combinations.    Overall, everything is in an intuitive location - it's as if your hands naturally gravitate to the controls you need.  

Yes, there is a bud vase.  VW gives you a plain plastic vase - I am buying one made of brushed aluminum.   Real flowers will die quickly - New Beetle owners seem to have artificals (myself included), although some have plush or beaded bud vase displays.   

A note about the Monsoon audio system - I test drove New Beetles with and without Monsoon.   I was pleased with the system, particularly when the sunroof is open.   The system has enough punch to be easily heard above wind noise, and has a nice equalizer.    The one drawback is the lack of a  CD player as a standard feature - however VW is remedying this with an in-dash single disc player beginning with the 2004 model year.  


<b>Exterior</b>
My New Beetle has a Reflex Silver exterior.  The paint is durable and has a nice metallic look to it.  Invest in some good commercial bug remover - the rounded front grille and hood collects a lot of bug corpses.   

The windows are large and pleasant.  Rearview mirrors are fully adjustable and are adequately sized.   The sunroof (GLS and GLX only) is well-tinted.   All Turbo models have a rear spoiler that deploys autmatically when the car reaches around 45 MPH, then retracts flush with the back contour of the roof when speed slows below 10 MPH.   

The chassis is low to the road - in fact, when a New Beetle is towed, it's usually necessary to put it on a flatbed.  I haven't had any problems with scraping the undercarriage, but it is something to remember while driving.  I also have the 17" wheels instead of the standard 16", so I have an extra inch of clearance over the stock Beetle.  

I recommend the 17" alloys.  The car looks a little beefier and the wheels have a nicer look than the standard steel hubs.  


<b>Safety and Security</b>
I'm an engineer, and I am very pleased with the design for safety of this vehicle.   The New Beetle is a safe car.  I've seen pictures of crash testing...the front and back of the vehicle are crumple zones - even in a high speed crash, it's not likely that the passenger compartment will have intrusion.   The New Beetle is indeed "round for a reason" since the roof structure is a giant roll cage.   The ABS brakes and traction control system work just fine.  There are dual front airbags, along with side airbags.    Of course, wearing seatbelts is the best way to assure your safety in the event of an accident.  The New Beetle's seatbelts are comfortable and can extend significantly for larger folks.   

The New Beetle comes with a passive security system.  The "switchblade" style key-and-remote has a transponder in it - without the transponder, the key cannot turn over the engine.  The security system is armed when the doors are locked, and in the event of someone attempting to force open a locked door, window, or trunk, the horn will sound and lights will flash.  There is a red flashing indicator on the driver's door, as well as a red indicator on the audio system.    There is a panic button on the remote that causes the horn to sound and lights to flash until you press the panic button again to stop it.  To be honest, I have only tested the panic button once to ensure it will  work - the horn is LOUD!   By  the way, even if you forget to lock the vehicle, the  New Beetle will automatically  lock the doors/trunk and arm the sercurity system if no one has touched the car for 5 minutes.   

<b>Engine and Performance</b>
My New Beetle has the 1.8L DOHC inline four-cylinder, 20 valve engine with intercooled turbocharger.   I test drove both the standard  2.0L engine and the Turbo, and decided that with my mostly-highway commute, the Turbo offered me more power with identical mileage.   Although there is a very slight delay for the turbocharger to kick in, once you're moving the engine is very responsive.   I have the automatic transmission, and shifting is smooth and almost undetectable.    It's very easy to go fast in this car...I have gotten up to 80 MPH without even realizing it!   I rarely exceed the posted speed limit, but I like having the speed and responsiveness of the Turbo in the event I need it.  

Other engine options are the 2.0 liter gasoline engine (the standard engine for both the GL and GLS trim levels), and the 1.9L TDI turbodiesel (also available on the GL and GLS).  The 1.8T Turbo is available on the GL and GLS, and is standard on the GLX (which VW is phasing out as of the '04 MY).     

<b>Reliability</b>
I have not had any problems with my car.  My vehicle was late enough in the model year that it was not susceptible to the infamous ignition coil pack problem that plagued the 1.8 Turbo engine from 2001-early 2003 models.   Some people have had problems with window regulators, etc. but I've not experienced this.  


<b>Overall Impressions</b>
This car is a blast to drive, period.  It's comfortable and responsive, while still being "fun."  I only have about a 12-15 minute commute to work, and I find myself wishing it were a bit farther, so I could enjoy my New Beetle longer.  It's great to see kids smile and point, or play the "Punch Buggy" game with their friends.   New Beetle owners all seem to wave at each other - over the weekend I saw 2 Beetles, and exchanged friendly smiles and waves with both drivers.  

The dealership made me a great deal (I paid just under dealer invoice), and I am returning there for service.   I financed with VW Credit under the College Grad program, and got 1.9% financing, which I was very pleased with.  Also, before Sept. 30, 2003, everyone who buys a New Beetle hardtop recieves a free 15 GB Apple iPod MP3 player and car holder/adapter.   I was planning to have a CD player installed, but now am foregoing that in favor of the iPod.
