            Each time I shop the near-luxury segment, I try to sample all the big hitters with an offering at or under $35k (that's my limit).  Twice now, I thought long and hard about the Acura TL.  Twice now, I've wound up in a Volvo.  Last time out, it was the s70.  It has been a solid, comfortable, an reliable ride.  Volvo does comfort and safety very well.  This time around, I upped the ante and decided I wanted a little more "wow" factored in.  Some choices priced themselves out of contention because I had to build up many layers of options to get what I wanted. Other choices were long on wizardry and gadgets but short on substance. The TL type "S" offered a nice package of features and some serious ponies under the hood.  I was almost hooked. The last car on the list was the s60.  Turned out that I saved that I saved the best(IMHO) for last. 

The 2.4T with geartronic, premium and touring packages, and 17" wheels turned out to be EVERYTHING I was looking for at a price I can live with(ignore the sticker).  The car has an aesthetic appeal second to none.  The seats are the best in the business and the driving position is infinitely adjustable.  Headroom, even with a sunroof, is phenomenal up front and perfectly fine(for those of average height) in the rear. In fact, interior space is deceptively generous- don't be fooled by the numbers or your eyes, take a long test drive.  Acceleration is smooth and reasonably powerful with little turbo-lag(use the geartronic if you really need excessive punch). The ride is stable and quiet with just enough road feel and noise to keep you subtly aware of the pavement, and the brakes are stop on a dime good.  Some people have suggested that the steering feel is vague; you can feel some boost to it but the 17" wheels(with their wider tires) seem to tighten things back up nicely.  The stereo is well balanced, offering good dynamic range without the need to crank up the volume.  I'd prefer a multiple-CD in-dash unit but it's not an available option on the 2.4t; I don't want a trunk mounted changer, which is an option.  

When it comes to safety, the S60 cuts no corners.  It's true that the NHSTA is re-testing the frontal collision capabilities (Volvo has apparently made a change in the 2002 models)but I'm not too concerned with the outcome. Volvo builds its safety features with "real world" dynamics in mind.

I urge anyone considering a near-luxury sedan to take an S60 out for a spin.  You may not buy one, but it'll definitely warrant your consideration.  The performance and refinement that you get is perfectly balanced. 

02/02 update: Still looking for opportunities to go for a ride.  The car is silky-smooth; it's subtle nature rewards a relaxed driver with seamless comfort and performance- there's an almost telepathic response to the "quiet" driver.  You can over-steer, over-accelerate, and over-brake if you try getting heavy-handed.  Nearly sublime... 

06/02 update: I hate getting out of the car at the end of a road trip- the seats are better than my leather sofas at home. I've adjusted to the car and it fits like a glove. Driving on the highway is great fun. The car is darn quiet at high speeds and very stable.  I had to swerve hard left and right at 75 mph to avoid a truck that had cut across 3 lanes of a 4 lane highway (I was in the 3rd lane) and the car reacted more quickly than I anticipated.  No squeal, no lean- just a hard left and back to center.  The suspension has been neither hard nor soft, the brakes never come up short.  Only drawbacks thus far: There's no convenient place for my sun-screen when all 4 of us are in the car, I should've considered the multi-disc CD changer, and I only get about 21 mpg in mixed driving with the A/C running(as it usually is in S. Florida).  Oh, and replacing one of my low-profile Pirelli's cost almost $300 when I got a side-wall puncture.  No regrets, still enjoying every minute in the vehicle.

09/02 UPDATE:
Had my first scheduled service.  Skipped the rotation, had
warranty work done.  Another pleasant experience, still have no quarrels with Volvo when it comes to service spanning 2 cars over 4 years in 2 states.

*Oil change and filter($32) with service loaner($6 gas  surcharge) for a total of $38 out of pocket.  

*Loaded software updates for throttle management and transmission improvements.

*Replaced buggy front passenger-side door lock activator mechanism. It sometimes shorted and required that the passenger-side locks be activated manually.

*Replaced worn wiper blades

The car runs very well and is as comfortable as a worn glove.  Only downside is ride-quality over rough/rippled pavement, where the low-profile tires and chasis stiffness generate small but noticable vibration. This is typical for Volvo's and is better than the ride-quality in my s70. 

It's been a virtually trouble-free 10 months (except for the flat tire and very occasional door-lock issue). I've been averaging around 18.5 MPG in very mixed stop and go with the A/C running.
