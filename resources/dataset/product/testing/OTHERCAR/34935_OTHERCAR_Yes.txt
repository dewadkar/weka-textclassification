            The Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Coupe is very nice car.  It has a classy look and a sporty look all at the same time.  The car body is a sporty look with the classy touch.  The car carries sport style tires.  I have seen the car in every color you can think of. My mom's is red, bright red and most of the trim is black.  It is a sharp looking car.

It is a two door, of course, this is about a coupe.  It is a 6 clyinder.  It has power door locks, tilt and cruise.  It has an AM/FM radio with cassette player.  The dash looks huge because it goes back pretty deep. It has dual airbags, one in the steering wheel and one on the passenger side dash.

The interior is a charcoal gray color.  The seats are adjustable and will lean all the way back, if you get the urge to snooze will riding.  However, you can't snooze if you are driving, lol.

It has heat and air, which has never failed or given any trouble to her.  It is an automatic and is in the middle in the floor.  The front seats are like bucket seats.  The backseats are not all that comfortable for adults.  However, they are the most comfortable of all the two door I have ever ridden in.

The car rides very smooth, no bumping or shaking.  I have never heard any noises while I have been in it.  The car gets great gas mileage.  Hers has about 50,000 miles on it.  

It has been an excellent car for my mother and would make an great for anyone out there.  She bought it used I think they paid around $8,000 for it.

It was purchased in Dyersburg, Tennessee at United Olds Mazda.  It did have one recall on it but the dealer took care of it immediately.

It would make a great car for anyone looking for a reliable and sporty car.
