            Hi there, me again :) . THis time I am recomending to you a great riding and driving car , we had a 95' subaru legacy LS purchased in 11/95 .. we had bought a 95'impreza the year before and liked the subaru products ,  but wanted a nicer car to travel in .. this was a navy blue 4 door , moon roof,automatic tranny , 4x4 , had all the extras but a cd player ... we drove this everywhere it was a great handling , great summer and winter car .. this is a heavenly car even with kids .. we took several road trips and were never uncomfortable or upset with the ride , no maintenance other than the typical upkeep stuff .. why didn't we buy again we were not happy with the dealer here in our area .. so in jan of 99' we bought a s10 blazer.. and even though that is a great vehicle we were discussing today someday we are gonna have to find another subaru dealer .. since our legacy was a dream on wheels ... if you are in the market for a great car .. they are perfect .. as well as sharp looking<br><br>
