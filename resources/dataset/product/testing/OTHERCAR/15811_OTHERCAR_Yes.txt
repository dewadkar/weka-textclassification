            Looking for something just below luxury-class with all the luxuries?  Something bigger than a sportscar (bigger than a lot of sedans, actually) but still with a lot of zip.  Looking for the best V-6 in its price range?  I was, which is why I bought the Solara -- and I have not been disappointed.

I haven't been in a car this comfortable since I was a kid riding in Mom's Caddy Coupe.  The sound and climate control systems are great, and the seats are cushy and firm at the same time.  

The drive is smooth and powerful.  A little too smooth for me, coming from a choppy Mazda 626, but, for those of us who like a little leg room and are finally starting to grow up a little (i'm 32), it's a neat compromise between a high-performance sports car and boring sedan.  The ride is different than that of a sports sedan, too.  When you step full throttle on this one it's kind of like being transported through a vertical pressure mail slot, just a smooth whoosh and you're from one end of the block to the other faster than you can even lock your seatbelt.  Just slow down on the corners or when changing lanes a bit more than you would with, say an Acura Integra or the like.

And how does it look?  I get compliments all the time, and feel like I'm driving a car made for the 21st century.<br><br>
