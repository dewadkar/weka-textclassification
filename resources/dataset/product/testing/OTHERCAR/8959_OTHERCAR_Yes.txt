                 There really is nothing that I do not like about my 1999 Plymouth Breeze. I like the color (white), I like the way it drives, the way it handles, need I say more?
     This is my first new car and it has been a good experience. The seats are comfortable when you slide in, there is plenty of leg room and head room inside, and even the stereo has a high quality sound to it. The ride is smooth and quiet and the closeness of all the dashboard instruments make it a totally comfortable ride.
     However, I must say that the best part of owning a Breeze is the fact that now I can park next to any car in the lot and not feel that I am driving something second rate. The overall look of the car rivals that of the overpriced luxury cars and is much less expensive in price.
     If you are looking for a good all around car, the Breeze makes perfect sense.<br><br>
