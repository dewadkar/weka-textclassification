            This car is a mixed bag of toys, coming with Mercedes-Benz's wave of cost effective cars.  I seems perfect at first with its cool hardtop, and its supercharged engine.

The only problem is that the fun effect will wear off.  The hard top is a nice feature, I must admit, but not an overwhelming advantage.  A soft top would protect from the rain, and its not like the SLK can be taken out in the snow.

The biggest current downfall of this car is its performance.  It is seriously heavy.  And even thought the engine is turbocharged its 185 horsepower runs out.  Especially considering the tough competition it is now against...the Boxter, M3, TT, and the Honda S2000 (too hard to get).

Another new disadvantage is Mercedes zero bargaining policy, meaning you have to pay sticker price.  Additionally, the price has gone up, plus an automatic transmission is extra, where as most people would get it.  Plus, the exterior package, which helps out the car alot in terms of looking like a toy, is way too expensive.

There are three good alternatives
1.  buy a used 500SL
2.  buy one its competition
3.  or wait until spring/summer of 2000, when Mercedes is releasing a V6 engine for this car (how exciting, and about time!!!)

Good look with your decision.<br><br>
