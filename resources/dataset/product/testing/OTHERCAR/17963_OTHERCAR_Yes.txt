            This MUST HAVE SUV is loaded with fun.  It easy handling makes it good on the streets and its outstanding suspension makes it a great off roading car.  It is always fun to ride in.  My family has one, and its a great car that gets fairly good mileage.  The thing we love best about this car is the way that people look at it as if they envy us for having it.  It can come with either a hard top or a soft top.  Ours we got with a hard top, and if it is too hot outside we can take off the hard top and put on a bikini top (only covers the first two seats).  Either that or we can just leave all tops off of it.  Its standard features are great, such as four wheel drive and a cd player or tape player.  Also, speakers come on the roll cage, and they provide great surround sound.  I would highly recommend getting this vehicle.  It is always fun to ride in and my family loves it!<br><br>
