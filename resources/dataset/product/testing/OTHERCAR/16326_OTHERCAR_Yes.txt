            I got this camera as a Christmas gift.  When I opened the box I thought to myself, &quot;I wonder if I'll ever use this?&quot;.  I already have a great 35mm camera and a scanner.  Once I put the batteries in and opened the shutter cover I was hooked.  The major advantages of this camera over my 35mm are price (no developing charges) and instant gratification.  It's like having an instant camera without the expensive film.  The disc that came with my camera holds up to 80 images (depending on the desired resolution) and if you mess up a picture, you can simply erase it.  Like most HP devices, this camera is VERY user friendly.  You will be taking pictures almost immediately.  One of the best uses for this camera is to post pictures on eBay and other on-line auctions.  I would assume it works just as well for posting images on websites. I also use this camera to document my collections and to document things at work.  The only disadvantages I can see are the lack of zoom (there is a digital zoom on my camera, but it's only 2X.) and the quality of printed images.  I have a great printer and even the best quality photo from this camera is less than a &quot;real photo&quot; but not by much. This is so much more than just another &quot;techno toy&quot;. You will find a new use each day!<br><br>
