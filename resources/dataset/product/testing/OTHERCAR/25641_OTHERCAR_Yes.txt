            In mid -August I bought a Saab 9-5 wagon for my wife.  We have been a Saab  family for years and the wagon was something that we felt would be very practical.  We chose the 4 cylinder 2.3 liter 5 speed manual.  Air conditioned leather seats were the only option.  The car is dark green with beige leather interiors.  We added a sport exhaust system and a dark anodized grille.  

We have over 7000 miles on the car now [mid December], and have been delighted with it.  It has excellent packaging, lots of comfortable passenger space and lots of carrying capacity.  Styling is really stunning.....I feel the best looking in the Saab line at the current time.

The handling is stunning.  It is a great combination of ride and cornering power.  Supple but comfortable.  The 170 HP turbo motor is very linear and responsive.  I feel it will be reliable.  My 1988 900 Saab has 184,000 miles and the 1985 has 195,500 and the engines have never been apart.

Wonderful balance of comfort, safety, performance and value.  Sticker price was under $33,000.<br><br>
