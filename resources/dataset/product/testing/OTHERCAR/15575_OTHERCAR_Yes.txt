            I find this to be a very comfortable ride. Roomier driver seating than most, and very acceptable performance. I bought the 2wd model as I seldom go off road but I do appreciate the ground clearance when I do. The ride is better than my Nissan Maxima, except that there is more body roll. I suppose that is to be expected with the bigger tires and higher ground clearance. I get good fuel economy, 18-19 MPG around town and 22 -24 MPG on the road to Vegas, (75 MPH+). The 175 HP V-6 is quite adequate for this size vehicle. Driver visibility is excellent, seats are comfortable, and there is plenty of room for my wife and my toys. Anyone with a bunch of kids might want to get the larger version with another seat as the Montero seats only 5. 
The dealer was very pleasant and they did not haggle over price, (I paid $25350 out the door).
There is little to complain about this vehicle. There is some wind noise at highway speeds, and a little more body roll on cornering than I am used to, but handling seems to be excellent. The odometer is hard to read unless the sun is shining on it, I think a small illuminating lamp or LED should be considered by Mitsubishi. The drink holder,(when in use), masks the heater and radio controls and the holes should be a little larger. If you are into changing your own oil and filter it looks like the skid plates under the engine have to be removed first, but only requires the removal of a half-dozen or so bolts. There is little braking effect when down shifting so driving in hills might require lots of brake use. The brake are excellent.
I think the styling is a little &quot;boxy&quot; but that's OK with me. I didn't buy it to impress anyone. I pulled the &quot;Mitsubishi&quot; off the back door and replaced it with &quot;Le Box&quot; <br><br>
