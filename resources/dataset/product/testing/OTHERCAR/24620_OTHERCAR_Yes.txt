            My family just added a 2000 I30t to the family garage and we really like the car.  It is a Titanium colored one, like in the commercials, with all the options.  We wanted to keep our new car budget under $35K for this car.  To go any more would be in the $50-60K amount, which was not what we wanted to do.  Anything less would have been, in the Camry/Accord league.  The objective was to get something very nice and different.  The I30t was the right choice.

The car is a world of a difference with the Touring package.  It adds the performance items that support all the power (227hp) under the hood.  It comes with 17&quot; rims and tires which are great in performance driving.  The vehicle comes with a very nice interior layout, which is driver friendly.  The vehicle is nice without being to plain.  It can be driven with the feeling that it won't be as common as its counterparts.  We looked at the Lexus ES300, but decided against it because it was not as aggressive in its driving manner.  The ES300 has looked the same for some time now.  The Acura TL was the next best choice for us.  What sold us about the Infiniti was the value of the car.  For its price it came with a ton of features.  Far above the rest in this category.  For right under $34K drive out, we purchased ours with every option.  It came with a standard rear sunshade, rear cup holders, cargo net, 24 month maintenance free service, leather, Performance package, Heated seats, traction control, Xenon lights, Moon roof/Sunroof, Temperature control and floor mats.  

The engine packs a nice punch and even with the 17&quot; tires, it has a comfortable ride.  At highway speeds the cabin remains quiet.  The rear cargo space is great for a family trip.  The interior appointments have come to challenge the higher competition.  

The bad side of the vehicle is the leather and wood.  One word to describe it is &quot;CHEAP&quot;!  The seats are comfortable but the leather is not near as nice as the Lexus.  The wood is the worst fake plastic I have ever seen.  Just like the Mitsubishi Galant or the Nissan Altima.  If the wood was real and there were more wood appointments through out the dash, it would make it great.  

Another complaint was the gear ratio of the car.  I was racing the car around the neighborhood, keeping below third gear, when I came to a stop sign at the intersection.  I saw a clearing and immediately jumped into traffic and slammed on the accelerator, big mistake.  The vehicle just sat there for a second and then came to life.  Luckily the engine has power and before someone could rear end me I was thankfully out of the way.  I called my dealership and said that I was having engine trouble but to my surprise my service advisor said that the vehicle had not down shifted into first quick enough.  This is the first time it had ever happened in any vehicle that I have owned.  I was really surprised to find this out, especially because the car is advertised as a sports sedan. It is also a different feeling for me to have Front wheel drive.  I miss being able to peel the back tires.  

For the most part I enjoy ownership of this vehicle.  It is nice to take out and release some stress through it.  It is worth its price and it is possible to get a great deal on one also.  <br><br>
