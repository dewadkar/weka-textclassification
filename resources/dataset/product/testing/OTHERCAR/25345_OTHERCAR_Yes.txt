            Just bought a 560SEL, 1986 off of ebay from the photos the car looked very good and from the description quite in good shape. It only has 115,000 miles which I was told that for a Mercedes it is still in the break-in period. 
On the positive side their are so many good points that it is very hard to enumerate them all, let's just say that I am used to owning Cadillacs and Lincolns and let me tell you that my Mercedes has absolutely nothing to envy them, on the contrary it puts the Lincolns and Cadillacs to shame, everything seems to be made so much better.
Well after owning it for close to 6 months now, I am in love with this car it is so tight and comfortable you can easily cruise down the interstate at 80 miles an hour and not feel any of the bumps, you won't hear the noise of the outside even the semi tractor trailers.
The car is very roomy front and back with front and back adjustable seats (electric) as well as heated front and back seats. the front seats each have 2 programmable recall buttons.The trunk is of cavernous proportion, you can fit easily 6 full size suitcases with room to spare.

The negative points are: 
1- The 5.6 liter engine is a true gas guzzler on the highway I get about 15 miles to the gallon, in town that goes down to about 11 or 12 miles a gallon, and only uses Premium gas 91 octane and higher.
2- Repairs, OUCH if you never owned a German car be prepared to shell out some serious money for them, here is a few examples of repairs made in the last 6 months: rear shocks (hydraulic) $ 950.00, front brakes; $ 250.00, full tune up replacing wiring, distributor cap, plugs, rotor: $ 750.00, replace head gasket $ 2,900.00
the only thing left for me to address in order to have the car in perfect mechanical condition is replace the internal transmission gasket which I was quoted $ 1,200.00 
This sounds and is expensive, but remember that this car will still be going strong after 4 or 500,000 miles, I figure that it is worth the investment.
In 1986 this car sold at the dealership for $ 60,500.00 plus tax.<br><br>
