            Just sitting in this car is a thrilling experience. Let's face it, this kind of styling is a love-it or hate-it decision. Audi has tastefully styled this beautiful machine with accents of aluminum, cutting edge yet retro styling that evokes the TT class cars of 50+ years ago. The handling of Audi's quattro system makes this car feel extremely precise and responsive. You only have to ask yourself whether you want to take the hardtop now or wait for the convertible later. I'm biased. I've owned two Audi's, including my current Audi Cabriolet. My experience with past Audi's leads me to believe that reliability will be top-notch and that the overall ownership experience will be very pleasant.

One caveat: Audi's have depreciated at a higher rate than their competition, though I would not expect this to be the case with this limited edition, high-demand car.

With looks like these, you'll be fielding lots of lustful stares and many comments about how great this car looks.<br><br>
