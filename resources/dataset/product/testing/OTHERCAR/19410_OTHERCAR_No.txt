            My family purchased a 1999 Honda CRV EX in June 1999.  We had owned numerous Honda vehicles before and been extremely satisfied with all of them.  However, this one is a change.  The main problem I have with it are the anti-lock brakes. 
I have had them on other vehicles and found them indespensible.  But they just don't seem to cut it on the CRV.  Come winter I slid all over the road despite the 4-wheel drive feature.  I just do not feel secure in driving this vehicle.  
One plus is lots of cargo room (love the rear folding seats for the dogs to ride in back).  I like the upholestery... doesn't show a lot of dirt.  The interior is more than roomy enough for my family but none of us are very tall.  The seats are a bit firm and cause my back to ache after a couple hours of extended driving.  
The visibility for me is not the greatest, with considerable blind spots no matter how I adjust the mirrors.  The bottom line on this vehicle -- cute and fun to look at but not at all fun to drive.
