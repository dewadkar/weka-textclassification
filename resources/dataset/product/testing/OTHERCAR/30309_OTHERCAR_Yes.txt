            We purchased our 1990 Isuzu Trooper brand new. We first purchased it because of the price, and it seemed like a good size for our family....then three children, and we needed a four-wheel drive vehicle because we liked to camp and hunt. 

Well what a treasure it has become! It now has 263,000. miles on it, and is still going strong. We didn't trade it in after it was paid for, because it was running so well. Its obviously a work horse. I love how dependable it is and the roomy interior. I do hate the ride...it has very stiff suspension, and very few amenities. If you're looking for a luxury vehicle, don't purchase a Trooper. If you need a long lasting, well built vehicle with lots of room to pack stuff, buy it. <br><br>
