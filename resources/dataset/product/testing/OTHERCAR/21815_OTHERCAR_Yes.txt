               The previous reviews are right on. There are other very detailed and scientific reviews so I will give you my perspective about this camera.
   I purchased this as a gift for my wife. It was $300 with a Lexar 128mb SD card and extra battery @ Office Max on sale.
   I have owned a Nikon 990 and currently shoot a Olympus E-20. I wanted my wife to have a simple to operate camera and Canon is tops in the area of simplicity. The controls and menus are easy to use. This camera is great for grab shots of family and the size and durability of a stainless steel case make it a great camera to keep readily available when on outdoor excursions. 

My simple Testing:

   I tested the camera for the "purple fringing" and don't find it to be a major issue. The situations I've seen, either in my own tests or the web examples, involve what I consider to be overexposure of certain components of the frame area. I personally try to avoid this because of the lack of contrast and color caused by over-exposure which are conditions that should be corrected or avoided any way. The focus is good and is adequate in low light. The test shots I shot were generally very good. Outdoor results were great. The indoor "less than preferable" light conditions were a little noisy and a little soft(not bad though). In better light, the indoor shots were pretty good. The color accuracy is very good. The LCD is excellent, however I only use it to review pictures. The viewfinder is good and has enough eye relief for eyeglass wearers. Other reviews had put a negative light on viewfinder because it only covers about 85% of the image area. I see this as a plus because framing the picture by the viewfinder allows room for cropping rather framing the picture to tight.

   Overall I believe this camera will produce pleasing photographs and at current prices of about $260 it's a good buy compared to other 3mp compacts. I would recommend buying at least a 128mb card ($60)and an extra battery($15-$35).
