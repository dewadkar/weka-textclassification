            The Fuji Finepix is a stylish chap, make no mistake. It's cunningly designed to snuggle up into the back of your hand, and that's a very nice feeling.
Here's what it can offer you:

- 4.3 million pixel image file
- 2400 x 1800 resolution
- 38-114mm zoom lens
- real image viewfinder
- variable shutter speed - 3s to 1/2000s!
- 2ins TFT screen
- 16Mb media card
- 2s fast start-up time.

That's a lot of features, I'm sure you'll agree. Lets go into more detail:

<b>Picture Quality</b>: With 2400x1800 resolution, shots are of extremely high quality, and the colour is good. Also with the viewfinder, you'll get previews of what you've taken. I've found that the pictures make a good transistion from the camera to the PC and beyond.
The zoom is good, up to 3.75x in digital, which may not sound a lot, but is compensated for by a nice lens. 
This is complemented for by a wide range of shutter speeds: up to 1/2000s, meaning that in the time of a blink, you can take up to 2000 photos. The slowest speed is 3s, try taking some photos here for some really weird results.

<b>Ease of Use</b>: The viewfinder here really makes all the difference. You're able to see what you've taken, and either erase it or keep it. The design is really good, and it's comfortable to use. There's a continous shooting facilty, great, if like me you take sporty photos, and extra touches like a 2 second start-up time make it the ideal camera just to take out of your pocket to catch something.

<b>Overall</b>: This is a great camera which is very easy to use. The viewfinder makes a lot of difference; great if you're not too hot at taking photos. <br><br>
