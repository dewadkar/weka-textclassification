            I own a 1990 Nissan 300ZX 2+2, it was only number 324 off the production line (I still have the window sticker framed in my garage), and came equiped with T-Tops, 5Spd Manual, A/C, Premium Sound, Alloy Wheels and Security System. After over five years on the road (I bought it when it was 5 years old), I must say that this is the most reliable and fun car I've ever owned. I have only had two breakdowns on the road, and one of them was due to an ignition control module which was under Recall by Nissan Corp....so they reimbursed me for every single expense including the towing. This is a sporty car, with classic and timeless lines. It is fun to drive, with enough power to keep you happy, and the control, stability and handling normally only found in European cars. Insurance rates are also very reasonable for this vehicle, particularly if you get the  non-turbo model. I just had a complete tune up done and it is running like a new car....with over 175K miles on the odometer. I plan to keep this car for a long time, eventually I hope to slowly customize and rebuild every aspect of it, from transmission and engine to interior and paint. 
I have only one gripe about this vehicle: the back seat is ridiculously small; then again, I think it may have been intended to transport children, not three full grown friends on a five hour trip to Las Vegas.

Z Cars have been around for many years, from the introduction of the 240Z in 1970 until the 300ZX's very last model year of 1996, Z's have captured the hearts of sports car enthusiasts around the world. 
This true classic is not currently in production , but if you can get your hands on a used one, I would highly suggest it..but rest assured it won't be mine. 
A new Z line of cars is scheduled for release in the upcoming couple of years, you can get a sneak peak by logging on to www.nissanmotors.com<br><br>
