            Boy do I love this vehicle...  I have been looking for a vehicle and my wife said lets try for a SUV...  I was not sure I would be able to afford a SUV but I said ok...  And it looks like I was able to even think about one...  And one day we decided to go looking again and we finally went to get one...  Even though I still had to go through the bank...  But we got it...  And boy do I love it...  When we took a test drive we really like it...  The ride is real smooth...  The engine is quit...  The last vehicle was so loud and falling apart I had to get a new vehicle and finally I did...  The other thing I like is the price...  I was surprised when I got the Rodeo that it did not cost that much...  It was about $15k...  I got a 96  LS 4 Dr Sport almost fully loaded...  All power, with a alarm system in it...  The only thing it is missing is a CD player...  But I still love it...  I got a 96  LS 4 Dr Sport almost fully loaded...  And I am glad I did...  We are about to take this SUV on a long trip to VA...  I just hope that the long drive will feel good... As it does on short trips to work and to the stores...  

I really recommend this vehicle to anyone that can afford it...  The ride is great...  A lot of chooses...
