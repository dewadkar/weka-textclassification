            <b> Background </b>
I do not personally own this camera, although, one of my good friends does, and I've used his a few times. I'm going to detail for you what I've experienced with this camera over the past month. As of April 2001, Fuji has released a camera which is the 4900's "big brother", the 6900,  which takes a picture with 6.0 Mega Pixels, as opposed to the 4900's 4.3  Mega Pixels. I'll probably get that one, it has the same features pretty much, with better CCD's.

<b> General Info </b>
The FinePix 4900 Zoom features Fujifilm's new Super CCD and PxGA color image processing technology which captures and faithfully reproduces more color than the conventional "MegaPixel" CCD's found in most other digital cameras. Some other interesting and very useful features include: manual focus, aperture or shutter priority, multiple ISO's (125,200,400,800) , hot shoe mount and an electronic mini LCD through-the-lens (TTL) viewfinder plus a 2" LCD monitor. I'm going to say here that the images this camera produces are extremely nice, and much nicer than any other digital still camera I have seen.

<b> Accessories </b>
The basic camera package comes with the following items: 16mb SmartMedia Memory Card,  NP-80 Lithium-ion rechargeable battery with Charger, AV cable, USB cable, Adobe  PhotoDeluxe v3 (Windows only), USB driver, Exif Viewer, DP Editor. Of course you're also going to need more memory cards and more batteries and these are available from just about any of your larger photo/video retailers. A  32 MB Memory Card is gonna run about  $ 50.00, and an extra NP80 Battery is about  $ 55.00. YOU WILL NEED THESE. 16 MB and 1 battery is not going to be enough if you're going to use this camera to it's full potential. And, after paying nearly $800.00ï¿½. who isn't?

<b> Using it </b>
I'll have to admit, at first, it was a little overwhelming. This is definitely more of professional level camera and has a lot of things a typical point-and-shoot user isn't going to want or need. There are a multitude of buttons all around the camera body. You've got the shutter button, focusing mode selector switch, exposure compensation button, custom white balance button, info button, zoom button, and the flash pop up button. After sitting down with it though, it all made a little more sense. I didn't have a manual so it was just, "push this button and see what happens." The on-screen menus are fairly intuitive and if I can figure them out, anyone can.  Something else about this camera is its weight. It is VERY light weight, and that's good if you have to carry it around. Anyone who uses a regular 35mm SLR knows what I'm talking about.

Of course the neatest thing about the camera is that 2" LCD monitor. I think the general public is becoming spoiled by the way camcorders these days have flip out LCD screens, so now digital still cameras are including them too. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It is a VERY useful feature.

Another thing that is handy is, you can change the quality level of the pictures.  If you're crunched for space, and you need to take more pic's, just lower the resolution and you're ready to go. With the 16MB card that comes with the camera, you can take anywhere from like 6 to several hundred pictures depending on the quality setting you choose. The highest quality settings are good for printing out 8x10's on a photo printer.

Which brings us to a good section to discuss hooking it up to your computer. All you've got to do is install a driver (which is provided of course), hook up the USB cable, and turn everything on. The computer will recognize the camera as an external hard drive, and you just drag and drop the files as you would with any other desktop application. It's so easy!

There are a few things I don't like about the camera, and I'm not sure if they can be changed. It has a power saver mode, which is good, but it kicks in after about a minute. Which I guess is a good thing, considering the fact that the battery seems to have a relatively short life. We use this camera to take digital pictures at weddings and events and when we first got it, we could barely make it though a typical 8 hour day at a wedding with it. Another point, there are no filter threads! I guess I'm use to video cameras, but I would like to see threads so I could attach a UV filter, simply to protect the actual lens. Oh, I just remembered, there is some kind of software glitch in the one we have. It just dies sometimes for no reason. It completely locks up. The only way to get it to work again is to physically remove the battery and reinsert it into the camera. That's weird huh.

<b> Conclusions </b>
If you can afford $800 for a DSC, then I would highly recommend this camera. The picture quality is outstanding. Once you learn the features, and get comfortable with the buttons and menus, you will have a camera that should last you many years.
