            I got this camera as a birthday gift about three years ago. Since then, I've carried it everywhere I go with me because it's such a great camera. 
It's got a zoom function, you can change picture size, color and quaility, and the design is quite durable. 
I've knocked this little thing all over the place in the three years I've had it. I've dropped it several times, had it on my wrist when I open doors (which causes it to slam into the door frame as I pull back), had it rained on, had a rabbit chew on it once, and even knocked out of a window! The front cover didn't survive the trip out of the window, but the warranty from Olympus covered me and got the camera back to me at zero charge in about 2 weeks! 
The place where this camera really shines is the photos. The quality is wonderful for web publishing and family snapshots. I've resized these photos and not lost a bit of the sharpness! Not only that, but the camera snaps the photo as soon as you press the button. Some cameras lag a few seconds and you get the dog's butt instead of it's head. This one is so fast nothing has a chance to move. I've even gotten shots of birds in flight with it! If you're a professional photographer or someone that prints your photos, then the 2.1 megapixels is a bit on the short end though. 
My biggest complaint about this camera is the speed at which it goes through batteries. It uses 4 AA batteries (which make the camera a bit heavy, especially if you carry it everywhere, like me), but if you use alkaline batteries they last through about 2 weeks of daily use. I use the AA lithium ion batteries (which are a bit lighter and last longer) which last me about a month of daily use. Most stores, however, don't carry the AA lithium batteries, and I have to go to specialty shops.
