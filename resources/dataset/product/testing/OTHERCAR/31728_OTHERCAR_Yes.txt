                 For starters, this car is a family car and nothing else.  I do like the addition of the new 3.5 engine giving the RT 242 horsepower.  This gives a few of the fathers out there that want power but can't sacrifice the family for it.  The first thing that came to mind was a toned down Impala SS.
     One key feature that I liked the best was that Dodge added an Auto-Stick.  For anyone that doesn't recognize this term, it means that you can have the luxury of an automatic, yet the sport of the stick.  I am, and always have been a fan of stick shifts.  I like the idea of being able to drive the way I want when I am the only person in the car, but if I am with anyone else I am sure to use the Auto portion.  However, I don't like the way it works...  I am not fond of the motion required to shift.  
     17 inch wheels dramatically effect the handling of this car.  I did notice that it seemed shifty in the front while cornering fast, but since the size and width of the tires are large they quickly helped out.
     As for the interior, the instrument panel still has white backgrounds to help readibility.  There is plenty of room inside.  I have been told 5 people, but on my test drive I didn't get that opportunity to do so.  The trunk is pretty massive for loads of suitcases of your wife's makeup and hair-dryers and your luggage too.
     The good news is that a few of the standards for this car include, power windows, power mirrors, CD, tilt wheel, and ABS.<br><br>
