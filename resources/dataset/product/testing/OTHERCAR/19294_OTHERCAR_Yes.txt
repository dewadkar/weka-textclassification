            The Buying Process
First off, the biggest thing that caught my attention when choosing this camera was it's image quality.  After looking at the various reviews at megapixel.net and pcphotoreview.com, I came to realize that the Fuji Finepix 1400 has the &quot;best in class&quot; image quality of any 1.3 megapixel camera and under.  Because I was not concerned about any other features, this camera immediately appealed to me.  
Second, what caught me next was the price.  I recently found this great camera at beachcamera.com(around 3 weeks ago) for $298 + a $50 rebate I found at amazon.com(search for the camera and the rebate is on the camera's description page.  Hurry before it goes down!).  After doing some recent pricing it has come down to $248 at beachcamera + $50 rebate could mean a possible ~$200 great camera.
Lastly, I liked the look of the camera.  Most digital cameras have outlandish styling that just really stands out in crowds.  Although this is great if you want attention, I would rather not have everyone gawking at my expensive equipment.  This camera gives me the piece of mind that only the trained eye can tell it's an expensive digital camera.

The Camera Itself
All I can say is that the camera has lived up to all the hype around it.  The quick built-in USB connection makes connecting quick and easy.  You don't even need to buy an expensive AC adapter to transfer your files as transferring files is super-quick.  The battery life is around average, but pretty much every digital camera eats up batteries.  I would really reccommend 2 sets of rechargeables so you can charge one set while you are shooting with the other.  The LCD can be tough to see at times, but it's a very minor drawback.  The camera really shines when it comes to image quality.  You can easily make great 4 x 6 prints with a good printer.
The software installation is flawless.  Once installed your camera is instantly recognized as a removeable hard drive.  This allows you to just drag and drop your files within Windows Explorer/My Computer quickly and easily.  It includes Adobe Photodeluxe 3.0 which is a fun little throw in.  One other minor issue with the camera is that it only comes with 4mb of SmartMedia Memory.  But, with memory prices dropping(especially on Ebay and pricewatch.com) you can easily get 32mb at a great price(and I really reccommend it).  
Also, I have not encountered the body scraping others have mentioned.  Fuji probably has remedied this already.
Who would use this?
This camera is great for anyone looking for an entry-level point and shoot digital camera.  It produces great image quality and would be great for anyone who uses a regular point-n-shoot regularly.  If you use a SLR, you may feel a bit restricted by having less control, but you will undoubtedly be shocked by the image quality!<br><br>
