            Ok, I'll confess straight off: I don't like SUV's. I hate the fact that with almost no added utility and little sport value, they guzzle tons of gas and are the most wanted cars nowadays. The RX300 is a little different, though. I drove my friend's RX300 for 3 months now, since we are roommates, and have to say, it is very seducing. The luxury, I mean. Inside, it does not at all feel like a Jeep. Rather like a Mercedes-Benz 600. The power from the modestly-displaced 3-liter engine is very adequate and, unless you are speed-minded like I am, you will be satisfied with its road manners. In the latter, the car resembles the BMW X off-roader in the shared feeling of driving a much lighter car while behind its wheel. This Lexus is made to Feel like a Lexus - plush and sporty at the same time, with no extremes at either end, but with enough of both to make the trip a pleasure. Another thing I liked was the styling - original, although again, a bit reminiscent of the BMW. Driving comfort is great, there is a GPS, which tells you where you are at any time of the day, anywhere in the world, and a seat position memory module, so that different people can save their own settings (not only for the seats, but for the steering wheel, as well!). However, I WOULD NOT buy this car, even if I had the extra money to spare! What's the purpose? If I had kids, I'd buy a luxury sedan for the same price plus the comfort. Otherwise the $40-something grand could be utilized in a much more efficient way. And come on, there isn't much nature left to drive on! I am sure not even one percent of the people who own SUV's use their off-road capabilities to the full extent. So, I don't think ANYONE should buy this vehicle, although it is a damn nicely crafted piece of machinery!<br><br>
