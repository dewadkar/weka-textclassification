            My wife bought this car brand new before we met in 95. I met my wife in 97.We lived in California and so most of the miles put on the car were highway. I must say it's hard to beat 38-40MPG and 30-35MPG in town.
I'll admit I was brought up feeling that the only cars you buy were American. I have yet to see an American car stand up to the foreign market. 

Interior: Not much to look at but everything has its place. I like the fact that if you don't like factory radios, installation is easy with little dashboard moving. The Bucket seats are fairly comfortable but I would prefer a lumbar option for the long drives. The biggest con I found was with the seatbelts. The retracting spring in the roller doesn't seem to maintain tension after awhile and the belts twist easily. I also noticed that the craftsmanship of the seats was cheaply done. after the first year the material started to separate at the seams. I just threw seat covers over the seat material and ignored it.

Exterior: The 95 model was pretty simple. I do like the locked gas door for the extra security. The hood didn't &quot;disappear&quot; when trying to park, I could see it without worrying I would hit something.

Engine: The 1.5L engine has an easy configuration when having to do basic maintenance on it (i.e. replace belts, filters, spark plugs). The only two major problems that happened miles after expected was the alternator at 80,000 miles and the air conditioner at 60,000 miles. Now the AC I attribute to living in the desert of California and using the AC more than average. Other than those two problems, This engine is one of the most reliable engines I have experienced. Only one other drawback is that the AC when the compressor is running takes a few horsepower from the engine's torque so the takeoff from a stop is reduced. This does not effect the car when up to speed.

After 115,000+ miles this car is still in my possession and I will keep it until I can't buy parts for it anymore!
