            My first Buick Skylark I owned was a 1990 of which I enjoyed the style of the car however after owning it for 2 months the motor blew.  According to many mechanics the quad 4 motor is notorious for blowing a head gasket.  It is also a very expensive repair not to mention a pain in the royal butt!!

The second Buick Skylark I purchased was a 1993 and that one has the V6 motor which is more durable.  The only problem I've had with this one so far is the mass air flow censor and the fuel pump which probably are due to a lack of care by the previous owner.  The body on the 1993 has held up a lot better than the 1990 ever considered holding up.  

All in all I would recommend the newer versions of the Skylarks as they seem to be much more durable and reliable. (Which is important when you have children)
