            Previously to purchasing this vehicle, I owned a 1995 Plymouth Voyager with the infamous "Ultradrive" transmission, which was a terrible minivan and gave me nothing but 129,000 miles of lemon-scented trouble. But what do you do with lemons? You make lemonade! I already own one Astro, a 1994 model with over 198,000 miles on the original powertrain. I wanted another Astro, one with which I could go on vacation with, because, let's face it: 200,000 miles is a lot for any vehicle, even one as reliable and rock-solid as my '94 Astro. Furthermore, now that two out of my four children are driving, it was a priority for me to make sure they had reliable transportation to and from school, work, etc. I was lucky enough to come across a 2001 model that was being sold at a rock-bottom price, primarily because of its higher highway mileage.

My 2001 Astro has all-wheel drive in addition to the top-level LT decor package, which in addition to some nifty body stripes and sweet-looking aluminum wheels, features upgraded seats and stereo equipment. It had 47,000 miles on the odometer, and it cost me $14,000. 

The Chevrolet Astro has rode on much the same platform for over 17 years, undergoing the equivalent of a nose job in 1995, which gave the Astro its current undercut profile. Under the slab-sided sheetmetal, the Astro has a fully-boxed ladder frame, as opposed to a unit body, which most smaller minivans use. 

Under the hood, 4.3 liters of Chevrolet truck V-6 engine produce 190 horsepower and 250 foot-pounds of torque. Due to the engine's large displacement and pushrod design, much of the engine's torque is manufactured under 2800 rpm, making for easy low-speed acceleration. This engine is hooked up to a four-speed automatic transmission, which is one of the best in the business in terms of smooth operation and longevity. A newer feature is a separate trailering mode that holds engine revs longer between shifts for easier acceleration under load. 

My Astro has all-wheel-drive, a godsend especially in rough Central New York winters, where roads are snow-covered at best and impassable at worst. The van just glides right through the snow, accelerates without stumbling or slipping, and stops sure and straight. Not that AWD is a substitute for safe driving practices, but I do feel safer knowing that my kids probably won't ever get stuck somewhere trying to climb an icy hill. This system is seamless, with no user intervention required. An added bonus is the better sense of front-rear balance it gives the van on dry roads. 

My particular Astro is dark blue ("Medium Cadet Blue Metallic") on top with two-tone "Pewter Metallic" lower cladding. I believe this is a rather popular color combination, and with good reason: It has a very classy look to it that complements the straight, upright profile of the vehicle very nicely without adding needless froufrou. Adding a polished look is a set of 15" brushed five-spoke aluminum wheels and white-letter tires. 

On the inside, high-back bucket seats with fixed headrests are standard, with power available on the driver's side. The LT model, however, has "special cloth" seating for eight, with dual front buckets (with adjustable headrests) and two bench seats with folding armrests. The dashboard is a vast improvement over my '94 model, featuring a three-dial climate control system and a modern Delco radio with both a cassette and CD player instead of the antediluvian sound system my '94 Astro uses. The overall look of the interior has been modernized, with rounded contours and a more useful center console storage area. The steering wheel is standard-issue Chevrolet truck, a four-spoke leather-wrapped affair with a recessed hub. I like the design because it is uncluttered with radio controls, cruise controls, etc. The overhead console has a nifty onboard computer that calculates average and instant fuel economy, trip mileage, estimated range on fuel remaining, and outside temperature/compass direction; as well as a number of storage compartments, reading lights, and a universal garage door opener.

The rear seats are also enjoyable places to be, with an abundance of cupholders, armrests, and air conditioning/heater vents. Rear passengers are also, in the LT model, treated to separate radio controls with headphone jacks. 

In the rear, the spacious cargo hold is accessed by a set of "Dutch" doors. The rear window flips up, while the bottom half is split in half again and opens outward, French door-style. It is a marvelous convenience to have when just a small amount of cargo is being loaded into the back.

Now that I've extolled the virtues of the Astro LT at length, it's time to talk about the few shortcomings of this wondrous vehicle. My biggest gripe with this car is the subpar fuel economy. The EPA rates the Astro at 15 mpg in the city and 20 on the highway with all-wheel drive. I consistently average between 16 and 18 in mostly highway driving (where I live, the 10 mile drive to the mall is highway driving). My other wish would be better safety scores. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that the Astro fared extremely poorly in a 40 mph offset crash test. The NHTSA awarded the Astro three stars for the driver and four for the front passenger in the 35 mph full-width frontal impact test. Although I have never been in an accident (knocking on wood), I am still unimpressed by these scores. I am also unimpressed by the quality of the plastics used on the interior. For a vehicle manufactured in 2001, I would expect the materials to be of a higher quality and of a richer texture and appearance. However, the Astro was primarily designed for the commercial consumer, not the luxury car-seeker. 

In summation, I would recommend the Astro, in spite of its questionable safety scores and unimpressive material quality, to anybody looking for a spacious, comfortable minivan, primarily because of the great value it offers and its proven reputation for reliability and durability.
