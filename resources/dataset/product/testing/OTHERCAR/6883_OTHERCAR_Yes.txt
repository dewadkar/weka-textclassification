            I recently traded in my 1990 Toyota Corolla after 8 years of ownership.  I bought my Corolla in 1992 while in college.  At that time the car was 2 years old and had 54,000 miles on it.  It had been a previous daily rental.  We were a little worried about the mileage on it, but being a Toyota we knew this little car was going to last.

We made the right deicision.  This car required very few trips to the shop and those were only after it had well over 100,000 miles on it. Those shop visits were usually inexpensive and easy to fix problems.

My Corolla was a great car, we took it all over.  We drove from Northern California to the Grand Canyon and home.  The next year we drove to Yellowstone and back home to Northern California.  We also took several weekend trips in our car.  

We would have purchased another Corolla but we opted for the Camry since we had a growing family (that is a separate review you might be interested in reading).  The Corolla is roomy enough but after the kids were born we bought a soft car top carrier to carry all our stuff when we went camping or whatever.  We also carried our canoe on top of our Corolla  when we went on canoeing trips.

This is a great car, one that will last you many years without significant problems, and will definitely go well over 100,000 miles.  When I traded mine in it had 160,000 miles on it.  What a great car!<br><br>
