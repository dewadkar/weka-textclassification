            What can you say? If you want a reliable car that gets good gas mileage, that is sporty looking and has room.. then you want the 1999 Honda Accord.  I personally own the 1998 Honda Accord LX and I love it.  Guess what my previous car was?  Yep you guessed in a 1991 Accord LX.  Why the Accord?  Well let's put it this way.  I put 226,000+ miles on my 1991 and made sure I kept it tuned and changed the fluids and I didn't start having trouble with it until the summer of 1998.  It has never failed to start in any weather condition.  The car has more than enough power to get you out of a situation or onto a freeway!  Oh and for all you enviromentally concious folks out there.. its smoke free! (laughing)!!! So for all you out there that need a car that will look good on you and work for you as well... its none other than the Honda Accord!!  Go get one, tell em' Section 31 sent ya!<br><br>
