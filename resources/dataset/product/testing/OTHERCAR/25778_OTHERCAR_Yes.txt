            After living in Memphis for two months, I found out why it's the second most popular place to lose your car.  My little '93 Altima was sacrificed to some thugs who stole it in the middle of the night.  After the cops found the car abandoned, I was finally able to realize the sweetness of this story.  They had done a number on the car, but they were after the radio...which hasn't worked in three years (it was an after-market add-on).  However, after ten years of owning an Altima, I've got a strong opinion about this fairly boring car.  

<b>The Goods</b>
For something this small, you'll be hard pressed to find another car with more zip.  Acceleration is just flat out great.  If you're trying to blow past someone in the right lane so you can make your exit in the next quarter mile, you'll be fine.  Up to the bitter end, it could pull out in traffic without a hitch.  I also liked all the amenities that came with this model--power locks, power windows, etc.  This is also a very reliable car.  It gets you where you need to go, and even after ten years, I wouldn't have hesitated to take this on a long trip. 

<b>The Bads</b>
First of all, the gas tank on this sucker is about the size of my grandmother's bladder ("can we pull over at the next gas station?").  You spend a lot of time getting fuel, which isn't something I particularly enjoy.

Something else I hated about this car was the automatic seat belts.  I called them attack belts, but basically, you close the door, the shoulder belt rides up a track on the door frame.  Fine...when it works, but an EXPENSIVE proposition when it busts (remember, the low tech version is practically maintenance free, and works better).

The designers could have come up with some smarter ideas, as well.  Instead of having a rear seat that folds down, this car has a fold down arm rest (yes, I said that right, an ARM REST).  So, if you've got ONE pair of skis, you're great, but other than that, it's useless (and I don't ski).  Also, like many cars in the early/mid 90's, the cup holder is in one of the stupidest places to put a cup holder--right in front of the radio.  So, if anything sloshes over, it's going directly into your cassette deck (I found out first hand that the cassette deck doesn't like Coca-Cola, which is why I got a different radio).  Another real design flaw is where the rear window brake lights are positioned.  Most bulbs in this car are easy to get to...except for those.  In order to change the bulbs (there are two) on the rear window brake light, you've got to go remove the back seat and disassemble part of the rear casing.  Basically, not worth it.  Oh, and one last BIG thing...the right front hub cap came off SEVERAL times.  I'm not the only one, either.  EVERY early/mid 90s Altima is missing a hubcap, and it wasn't because a stupid thief wanted a souvenir.  I replaced my hubcap four times before I'd had enough.  I talked with a friend of mine who replaced hers eight times before she called it quits.  Make a mental note and check the right (passenger's side) front hub cap on every 90s Nissan Altima...I'd give you pretty good odds that it's long since gone.

In the last two years I had the car, it began having electrical problems.  Specifically, the dashboard lights would flicker on and off, then eventually shut down.  None of the other lights failed, but as I found out, to get those lights fixed (so you can see such trivial things as your speed and how much gas you've got at night) would cost in the ballpark of $300-500 (according to the dealer).  That's a load of dough for something that shouldn't have gone out in the first place.

<b>The Bottom Line</b>
Would I recommend this car?  Without hesitation.  I was hoping and praying that it would get me through grad school, but alas, that was not to be.  To the bitter end, though, it was a great (if boring) car.  The "Bads" section is long, but you'll notice that a lot of those gripes are matters of taste, or annoying inconveniences.  Overall, this is a great car, and if you're looking for a reliable used car, you could do a lot worse.
