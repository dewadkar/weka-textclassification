            By even the most charitable measure the Beetle (sorry New Beetle) was a triumph of marketing hype over automotive design. Now I&#146m not one to automatically sneer at the idea of a re-bodied Golf (itself already overdue an update when the Beetle appeared) &#150 I&#146ve owned and like the Audi TT for example, love the SEAT Leon and even manage a smile when I see a Skoda whizzing up the autobahn. So it&#146s not that I&#146m a platform re-engineering snob &#150 it&#146s just that the packaging of the Beetle (New Beetle &#150 sorry again) was appalling.

At this point I can feel the Boomers bristling and can imagine the sound of people over at VW leafing through their rollerdexes in search of lawyers specializing in cease and desist. But the New Bug did have some fundamental issues. You couldn&#146t see out of it, either out of the front or the back. You couldn&#146t fit a passenger in the back. It had a dashboard so big you felt as though you were at the wheel of an 18 wheeler rather than a fun hatch. Okay it handled a little flatter than the Golf upon which it was based &#150 but you spent so much time trying to see around the A-pillars and into the traffic that you never really got to do that much cornering.

Of course none of this mattered. New Beetle enthusiasts didn&#146t care whether the car had an engine, a trunk or a lineage that linked directly to Hitler. They didn&#146t care that the car was the automotive equivalent of your granny in a mini-skirt and they certainly didn&#146t care that it was over-priced, under-engineered and more than a little flabby. They had other things on their minds.

The Beetle (New Beetle) was cute. It was the same shape as the old one, it didn&#146t sound as though it was about to explode, had some modern safety features and best of all it came with a plastic flower. This was a car that America could sink its dentures into. In a landscape devoid of the madness of Daihatsu, Citroen, Renault, Alfa Romeo and British marques (Morgan, Caterham) this was a care that had personality. It was the height of eccentricity. It was cool.

Of course there&#146s a cheap joke to be had here about how a nation that relies on the German&#146s to provide personality is a country that has to be in mourning for the imminent death of it&#146s culture &#150 but I&#146ll not be the one to make it.

So the Beetle was cool. It sold by the shed load. Suddenly it was everywhere. Not very cool. Shots of the new MINI started to leak out. Damn. Orders began to fall, inventory started to rise and the Beetle was suddenly in trouble.

One answer would have been to re-engineer the car. To launch a new, improved, kick butt version of the favorite but that of course would have cost a fortune &#150 and the New Beetle was never meant to be much of an investment &#150 it was meant to be a cash cow.

Which leads me to the New Beetle Convertible. A case of &#145When all else fails hack the roof off?&#148 or a genuine entry level soft-top designed to democratize open top cruising and fill every student parking spot in California?

An aside here &#150 the Beetle could be the quintessential Californian car, how about a hybrid version? Wolfsburg are you listening?


So what&#146s the convertible like? Well in the creamy off white that I drove it&#146s a bit of a looker. People actually wanted to talk to me about it. It was cool. I looked cool in it. Even when I was parking because no roof meant that I could see out of the back. Job done VW.

For the more technically minded I spent a long weekend in the two litre auto version. This is a six speed and it needs to be because even with an extra ratio or two the Topless Bug is in no hurry to get anywhere. I know that the point of a convertible is being seen but the VW takes the idea to extremes &#150 pulling away from traffic lights with all the urgency of a cruise liner pulling out of dock in the Bahamas. 60mph arrives in around 13 seconds but it feels longer &#150 as every man, woman, child and cyclist whizzes past you.

Much of this can be put down to the car&#146s weight &#150 at 1350 kgs it&#146s not light and that 2.0l, 115bhp, 8 valve engine is no spring chicken. All of this weight also means that the New Bug is not a car that begs to be driven hard through corners. Again this might not be quite as important in Florida (say) as it would be in Italy but you have to look at the general lethargy of the car and admit that it&#146s no sports coupe in bulky clothing. Where BMW&#146s MINI is a pocket rocket that will eat even a Ferrari through a slalom the VW is a soccer mom van in trendier track shoes. 

Being a van of course means that comfort is essential and the sunshine Bug does score here. Scuttle shake is all but eliminated (a result I&#146m told of extra internal bracing), scars in the road impressively dealt with and seats supportive and grippy in that attracts lint VW way. Space in the front is very good &#150 though the rear is a little pinched, you may fit two Italian Riveria behinds on the rear bench but in the US you&#146re going to struggle to get your massively overweight teen in there. Wiggle room not an option. Whilst those rear seats may no accommodate little Tiffany&#146s girth they will improve her posture &#150 being possibly the most upright rears I&#146ve ever encountered. 

Whilst on the interior &#150 everything is as solidly constructed as you&#146d expect from VW (never a company to scrimp on the things that the customer can see, touch or hear). The stereo is excellent and the air-conditioning powerful enough to keep you chilled even as the car moves glacially from 0-60.

Interestingly VW claims that the soft top will stow in 13 seconds &#150 meaning that you could hit STOW and then race off &#150 seeing whether you could hit 60 before it hits the back. The mechanism is hydro-electric and no doubt very clever &#150 giving the retro folded hood look of the 1940s original without the effort of manual folding. Stowed it looks neat and tidy and I have to say that it worked without fault during my four days with the car and with a precision that inspired confidence in a fool-proof future.


So what did I make of Bug minus roof. Well it was a bit of a mixed one really. The car certainly makes more sense as a convertible. It&#146s more practical too. And cooler. But my is it slow. And why is the interior so dour, yes VW I appreciate the quality but show me some fun here.

Would I buy one? No. The technology is too old, the engine too weak and the packaging just not good enough. Should you buy one? Sure, if you want to recreate an idealized youth or are young enough want a car that you&#146ll remember fondly in 30 years or if you just want to look cool as you cruise slowly (oh so slowly) along the main beach drag in search of the perfect partner / breakfast / wave.
