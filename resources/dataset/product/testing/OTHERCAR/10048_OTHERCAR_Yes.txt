            The 2002 Lexus ES300 is a redesign of one of the most popular Lexus models.  For the 2002 year, Lexus incorporated more of the GS styling to give the ES model a more modern and sleek look.   Others have compared the look to that of a Taurus which I agree it does have some similarities from the front hood.  

However, the rear tail lights now have the circular look and give the car a more sporty rear profile and distinguish it from the Tauruses of the world.

Overall though, I agree that the styling does not 'turn heads' in traffic - but then, most ES300 buyers are not under the illusion that the ES is a sports car.   The Lexus ES300 has little of the bells and whistles that other cars try to use to differentiate themselves and more of an 'elegant' approach to styling.

The interior is typical Lexus.  The white lit dashboard dials are absolutely a joy to view and provide a nice 'wow' factor at night.  After driving the ES300 and then going to a car with the traditional dash lighting, I found myself checking to see that I really had the lights on!  The Lexus dials are easy to read and stand out in daylight and especially at night. 

The stereo now includes a 6 disc in dash CD player (with most luxury models).  The controls are easy to use, however, in bright sunlight - they can be hard to read.

As for the interior room, I have found the ES300 with ample room for comfort.  I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and over 200 lbs.  I compared the ES300 to the Infinity I35 and the Acura TL.  Even though the Infinity lists more interior cabin room - I found the ES300 by far the most comfortable of the three for both driving and passenger use.  Even with the front seat adjusted for my size, the seat behind the driver seat is still usable.  The steering wheel seems to adjust higher than the others and provides a comfortable fit even for those taller than 6 feet.

The Lexus ES300 has about 20 options, but the combinations are primarily manufactured in 3 trim levels - base, luxury, luxury with Navigation package.   If you want to pick and choose your options, prepare to wait weeks/months for your Lexus to arrive.  The majority of the ES300's sold are the Luxury or the Luxury with Navigation models.  The base does not include leather seats and thus - there are very few made and bought.   The rough price ranges for the three are $31,000/$35,000/$38,000.   

In working with multiple dealers I found that the ES300 is in quite high demand in the Chicago area and there was very little dealing on the sticker price.  Some dealers were willing to go a few hundred below, but with none on the lot to sell, the dealers have little incentive to give price breaks.  I was told that it would take 2-4 weeks to get the particular color I was interested in (Blue Onyx) but it ended up taking roughly 4 days for them to locate one.  

The Blue Onyx is a new color for the 2002 ES300.  It is darker than the blue color offered for the IS300 and often it looks like black.  Its only in daylight and bright sunlight that you can see that it is actually a midnight blue.

The ride in the Lexus ES300 is nothing if not smooth.  The suspension effortlessly flows over road imperfections and at 80 mph the wind noise is minimal at best.  The handling and stability at high speeds (70-80mph) is equivalent to other cars at 40mph.  Braking is supurb and the plethora of safety features including curtain airbags front and rear gives the driver an unparalleled piece of mind. 

In addition, for those not familiar with Lexus the complete owership experience with Lexus dealers is a cut above the rest.  The dealers will pamper you even after you own the car.  They provide free loaner cars when service is performed and even provide the first 2 checkups free.

Complaints

While Lexus makes a fabulous car, but I have found several things that I would change in a perfect world.

Transmission - as other readers have noted, it does not always give an instant response.  This is especially true when you are in motion and hammer down the throttle. I found my ES300 hesitate for a half second to almost think 'which gear should I use'.  Once it found one, it was too low, it reved to high RPM's and then switched to a lower one that provided acceleration.  Overall this causes a 1 to 2 second delay before the car really 'takes off'.  Not the instantaneous 'push' that you would like to see especially when punching it to cut across traffic.  I am following up with the dealer to see if there might be some sort of reprogramming to fix the behavior.  The dealer has offered to go on a road test with me to understand the problem.

Steering Wheel controls - The ES300 comes with a steering wheel control that allows you to select the mode and reset the trip computers (avg mph, running time, fuel range).  While its nice to have the computer, it doesn't really need to have the control on the steering wheel.  Controls for either the stereo or the cruise control would be much more beneficial and both are not available on the steering wheel.

Cruise control - the driver control for cruise control is located under the windshield wiper control (at about 5pm on the steering wheel) and difficult to reach/use.

Gas Mileage - While rated at 21-29mph, in the first 1500 miles, I have yet to reach anything better than 26 on the highway (continuous highway driving, no A/C, 70-80mph) and no better than 19 city driving.  I would have expected numbers much closer to the stated averages especially since the ES300 seems to shift early to keep RPM's down and fuel efficiency up.  It even idles at 500 rpm when stopped (most cars run around 1000).

All of these complaints are quite picky and are in no way show-stoppers to recommending the car. It is a very enjoyable car to drive and provides a smooth, safe, and luxurious ride.  It provides what Lexus owners have come to expect - a luxury ride in an elegantly styled machine.

6 Month Update
*****************
After 6 Months of owning/driving the ES300, I would like to add a few more comments.

After getting used to the way the car shifts, I can say that I have somewhat 'adjusted' to the way the throttle and transmission is geared.  However, I still occasionally run into spots where I would like to see it react quicker.

The first six months and 5,500 miles have been flawless in performance, quietness of ride, and overall comfort.  I have had no mechanical problems and at the first two dealer service trips (regular maintenance) I was treated like royalty.  However, their price schedule is quite high ($100 for oil change and minor maintenance) so you certainly pay for the treatment.

Also, 6 months later I am still averaging around 20-22 MPG. I admit that I enjoy punching it when starting from a clean stop - but even when driving the majority of the miles on the highway at constant 60-75 mph speeds - I get no better than 24 MPG. (Sticker claims 21 city to 29 hwy)

I have a couple minor complaints to add to my list this time regarding the automatic programming on the car.  Certain features of the electronic lock/accessory system are preprogramed to behave in a certain manner. While some of them can be 'reprogrammed' by your service technician - others cannot.  The ones that can't be reprogrammed that I have found annoying are:

1 - You cannot lock all doors via the keyless remote if any door is open.  This is quite annoying because many times I want to carry my child in her car seat or other packages out of the car.  I exit, open the door where I want to take the items from, and want to press the key fob to lock the doors, put it in my pocket, then have both hands free to carry my items.  Well, the cars beeps at you and won't let you lock it until the door is closed. So you have to take your items out, set them down, then press the keyless remote, then put the keys in your pocket and go on.  This annoyance has caused me to leave my car inadvertantly unlocked (several times at the airport) because after getting my items out, I had forgotten all about locking the car.

2 - Moonroof - there is no way to have it autoclose when the car iginition is turned off.  My old car/moonroof did this and it was very helpful.

3 - Trunk - you cannot open the trunk via either the keyless remote or the glove box button while the car is running.  Lexus says this is a safety feature, I find it an annoyance when trying to drop friends off at the airport or wherever when I just want to pop the trunk so they can get their things without turning the car off.  I can understand if you cannot do this when the car is not in park, but forcing me to turn the car off, pop the trunk, then turn it on, is certainly not an elegant solution.

So again, overall the experience has been wonderful, but I have found a few minor annoyances.  I hope that Lexus takes these into consideration as they pursue 'perfection'.
