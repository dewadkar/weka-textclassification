            My 1995 Jimmy was the first SUV I purchased.  My experience was so horrible, I have vowed never again to buy a GM vehicle.  Before there was even 40000 miles on the vehicle I had to replace U-Joints, the alternator (twice), the freeze plug, the O2 Sensor, the fuel line, the fuel pump, the windshield wiper motor, and many minor but annoying things.  The vehicle also had problems with engine surge and the mechanics were unable to determine the cause.  The day I traded it in the &quot;service engine soon&quot; light was on AGAIN and it died three times on the way to the dealership.  Is this an extreme case? Maybe.  I'm definitely not a &quot;hard&quot; driver.  I never towed anything with it or went off-roading.  This was my commuter car.  I bought it because of the 4WD which I thought I needed in our Wisconsin winters. Other people I've talked to that have owned or own this vehicle have had problems, but most not to that extent.  When I was able to drive it, the ride was smooth and the height of the vehicle allowed for good visibility, but I was too worried about what would go wrong next to enjoy it.  The 4WD is a definite plus, but you don't need a Jimmy to get that.  My advice? Buy a Toyota!<br><br>
