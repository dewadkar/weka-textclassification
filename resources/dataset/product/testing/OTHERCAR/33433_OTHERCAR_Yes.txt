            This is my third Volkswagon Jetta.  I find the car to be durable and very trustworthy, in the worst of conditions.  The car has a ton of guts, I drive the 5 speed.  When you want action, it is there.  Especially in holiday traffic when you have to jump into the traffic lane.  It is easy to squeeze into small parking spaces, also.

The only drawbacks to the car are the poor seat tracks, which needs adjusted frequently.  The trim on the bottom of the seats, which is just for detail purposes only, has broken in all three cars.  If you purchase the white one the door trim changes colors, usually yellows.  The headlamps on two of them leaked water.

But even though the car needs a few tweaks, Volkswagon stands behind their product firmly and made repairs immediately without questions.  They also provided rental cars, at no charge, if they had to keep my car overnight.

It is an outstanding purchase for the money and the gas mileage is wonderful.  The interior is a dream on long trips and the comfort is one of the best I have ever driven.  The ride is a dream.  I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
