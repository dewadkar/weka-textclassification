            A Cavalier is perfect for a young, sporty driver.  Though I would not suggest this car for a family with older kids, I strongly recommend it for young adults.  Any Chevrolet is safe and dependable.  You will find very few mechanical problems with this car.  My entire family owns different models of Chevrolet, including a Malibu, Lumina, and Z71.  None of us have had any problems with our cars.  If you prefer a stick-shift car, whether you are a learner or professional stick-shift driver, a Cavalier is the route you should go.  It is the easiest five-speed I have ever driven.  The Cavalier has its disadvantages, as well as the advantages, but the advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages.  It is not the type of car you should invest in if you plan on driving lots of friends, because it is a small, two-door car, and it is not easy for those sitting in the back to get in and out of the car.  This is the perfect car for driving around town, running errands, or for taking long trips.  It may seem as if it does not have much room; however, you can fit so much into that little car.  In choosing a sporty compact car, the Cavalier is the route to go!<br><br>
