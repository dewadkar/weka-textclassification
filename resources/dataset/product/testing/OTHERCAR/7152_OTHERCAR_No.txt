            I bought a Chevy S10 back in 98 and the vehicle was new. The vehicle was bought in Brandon, MS at Rogers-Usry Chevrolet from a nice sales rep named Tony Mathieu. After having the truck for about a week, I started having problems and the truck was in the shop more than I was driving it. The first thing that happened was that the battery was bad, not only once but twice.  Then both door sensors had to be replaced. Then the driver's side handle fell off of the truck. So I was like what else is next? Well, then I took the truck to the car wash and the horn shorted out and ran the battery down; the truck had to be towed yet again to the dealership. After a few months of nothing going wrong with the truck, I thought that it was just some flaws and everything is okay. No sooner than that is when my large problems began. First, the truck has some type of built-in anti-theft system, and one day I got into my truck and it decided to keep my key and not start. So yet again the vehicle was towed to the shop and the whole locking assembly had to be replaced. Thank God all of this was under warranty. But then the worst happened yet again. A little less than a year later, another battery died. This time I took the truck to Turan-Foley Chevrolet in Gulfport Ms 2120 15St 39501. That is where I met a repair person named Oscar Harris. After tinkering around with my truck he finally came back to me and told me that the battery was just dead and asked me if I left any lights on. I then replied that the vehicle has a computer that prevents you from doing that. The computer automatically turns off any power to the truck after 15 minutes. Now this is the funny part: this is a manager in a Chevrolet repair shop and does not know that the truck has this feature?
Anyway, after a month or two had gone by I noticed that my truck's tires were cracked. So I went down to the Chevy dealer, spoke to Oscar again, and he told me to go to the Uniroyal dealer and have my tires replaced under the warranty. So I drove to Uniroyal tire highway 49 in Gulfport, MS and explained the situation to the service rep Tom. I was advised by him that since I had put Armorall on my tires, the warranty was void. I then left the tire place and went back to speak to Oscar. He told me that the tires were under warranty and that Uniroyal needed to replace them. I then left the Chevy dealership went home and called Uniroyal, spoke to Diana, and she then confirmed that the Armorall damaged the tire and I had no warranty. So I then called Armorall and spoke with Chad. He advised me that Armorall does extensive testing and there is no way that Armorall had caused the damage. So I then called Chevy's 800 number for complaints, spoke to Todd, and he advised me that he would get to the bottom if the tire problem. He never called back. After two weeks went by, I called the Chevy 800 number again spoke to Jason. He advised me that my case was still being looked at. Then 2 more months went by and I called Oscar again.  I asked him what the deal was and Oscar said to come on down and he will get some numbers off of your tires and order them. So I drove down to the Turran dealership once again. He wrote some numbers down, told me he would call in a few weeks, and HE NEVER DID. So I called Oscar back. He advised me that they would have a rep from Chevy arrive in a few days and he would look at my tires to make the decision. Well a month went by and no call. So I went down to the dealership, spoke with Oscar yet again to find out when this rep would arrive. I was told that oh he was here and did not stay long. At that point in time I knew I was getting the run around. So Oscar goes out to my truck and scribbles some more numbers down. He told me he would call in a few weeks. HE NEVER DID. About a month went by and I called Oscar AGAIN. Oscar told me that something happened to the sheet, and he would have to do another one. So I drove down to the dealership yet AGAIN. Oscar comes out and tells me there is a problem:  the tires are not under warranty for cracking. I told him that the manual that came with the truck says that the tires need to be replaced when they are cracked or when the fabric is visible. And don't try to tell me that the Armorall caused the cracking because the manual also says that if you put tire dressing on be careful not to get it on the paint. Oscar then replies,  "Can I see the manual?"  I told him I did not have it in the truck but I'm sure there is a manual to the s10 lying around in the building. So after approximately 20 min of sitting in my truck Oscar comes back and says he will not replace the tires. Now the funny thing is that the truck has a 3yr 36,000 bumper to bumper warranty that includes the tires. Now all of a sudden they do not want to honor their end of the contract. 
Point being the warranty that Chevy gives with the vehicles is nothing more than a dog and pony show. The people who work for Chevy obviously do not know the products they service. This experience had left me bitter in thinking about Chevy. I guess the days are gone when an American car company honors their end of a contract. I now truly understand why more people are buying foreign cars. At least companies like Toyota keep their promise. My wife has a 94 Toyota Tercel and it has never been in the shop. So what did I do to remedy the problem?  I sold my junk Chevy and bought a Toyota. Now the Chevy truck is just a bad dream.
As for Chevy and Oscar - may the company go bankrupt and you see the EVILS that you sell. The Chevy s-10 is junk and should be treated as such.
