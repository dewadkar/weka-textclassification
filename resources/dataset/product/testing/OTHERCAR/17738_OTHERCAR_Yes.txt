            I am starting into the nursing program this fall and needed a dependable car to drive.  My husband and I began looking and after several months we came across a 1994 SL2.  We were a little concerned at first because the car had 68,000 miles on it, but after test driving it we decided it was an excellent car.  Although it was a '94 it drove and handled better than any car we had test drove.  It was also very reasonably priced at $5500 with all the luxury features such as a power sunroof, power door locks and windows, and last but not least the child safety locks.  Because of all the safety features we have also received a large discount with our insurance company. With gas prices being so high I was thrilled to find out that my SL2 gets 30 or more miles to the gallon. This car also is able to hold up to the knocks and bangs it gets everyday from my children, because of the wonderful idea of plastic sides the body of my car will look new even when it is twenty years old.


I have never enjoyed driving a car as much as I do my SL2.  At this point I wouldn't trade it for a new one.  My husband and I have also decided when the unfortunate time comes that we have to purchase a new car that we will be purchasing a newer model of my Saturn.

Take one for a spin, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.<br><br>
