            I leased my Audi A4 1.8T in early April and I love it so far.  The 2002 styling is similar to the A6. I get numerous comments and complements on the look of this car. I got Dolphin grey with a platinum leatherette interior.  The interior platinum color tends to get dirty very quickly.  The door handle, floor mats, etc. need to be washed frequently because dirt/grease is visable.

The handling of the car is excellent.  I got the larger 16 inch tires.  The stiff german suspension keeps the car gripped to the road and makes for fun driving on country roads.  The Quattro system makes the car handle better during poor weather.  I have not yet used it in the snow, but I have felt its effects while driving in heavy rain storms.  I was ready to "oversteer" a potential skid on a flooded street, but the Quattro shifted the power to the tires that had a better grip on the wet road.

The engine is pepy but could use more horsepower.  I test drove the 3.0 version with the 220 HP however for the price the 1.8 170 HP is not too shabby.  The car rides smoothly at speeds up to 95 MPH.

The Tiptronic shifter is going to be useful in the snow but otherwise I don't use it too much.  They have gear shifter buttons for the tiptronics on the steering wheel.  These are not neccessary, would have been better if these steering wheel controls were for cruise control or the radio.

The auto dual climate control is great.  One passenger can have cool A/C at 65 degrees while the other can be heated at 80 degrees plus a heated seat.  The heated seats are great.  They are in the front seats and back seats.

The trunk space is large.  I like to ski, so I got the ski sack option to accommodate the skis through the back seat.  There are two side trunk compartments that are useful for storing items such as car cleaning materials.  The trunk also has a useful cargo net that keeps groceries from rolling around.  The remote key has a button to open the trunk.  Also there is a button on the inside part of the door.

Safety is big with the A4.  In addition to the Quattro AWD the car is equipped with numerous airbags both front and side.  Also included is a first aid kit and road reflecters.

The driver information display computer gives the driver info such as avg speed, avg MPG, actual MPG, outside temp, radio station or CD track.  It is the center piece of a well laid-out dashboard.  All items are within the drivers view and easy to read.  The dash illuminates to a cool red color that gives it an awesome airplane cockpit look.  The cruise control switch is the only item in a bad location.  It is under the directional and sometimes is tough to located when the wheel is being turned.

The 6 CD-indash player is easy to use as well as the AM/FM radio and cassette.  The are numerous well-placed speakers throughout the car but the overall sound is not as loud as it should be for the CDs.  Maximum volume for CDs isn't loud enough for those Rock and Roll music lovers.  The radio AM/FM does get loud enough.

The main complaint I have so far is the wind noise.  When driving on highways at speeds above 50 MPH there is alot of wind noise.  Also when the sunroof is open at speeds of more than 30 MPH the wind creates an annoying "thumping" sound as it gets trapped in the roof opening.

Overall I am very pleased with this car.
