            We needed an SUV a bit larger than our troublesome Mercedes ML320. We bought the American made Toyota Sequoia SR5 4x4 based upon looks, performance, room, value, handling, and reputation for reliability. The Sequoia drives very nicely for such a big vehicle.  The steering is light and accurate.  The transmission is seamless.  The engine is quiet and smooth.  Handling and maneuverability are outstanding considering the vehicle weighs 5000 lbs. We're still getting use to it, with only about 700 miles on the clock. Gas mileage is 16-17 MPG combined suburban/highway driving. This is the 2nd Toyota we've owned, and my initial reaction is it's not quite up to the standards of the Japanese manufactured Toyota models. The Sequoia has clearly been tailored to Toyota USA's perception of American market tastes, to the detriment of the vehicle in some areas.  Must be ex-GM people working there.  However, the Sequoia compares favorably with competing American makes.

Interior room is excellent.  The third seat is higher than in competing Chevy or Ford models, making it much more useable.  Legroom and headroom are good in all seating positions.   The third seats are split, foldable, removable, and they adjust fore and aft.  I like the locking differential (on 4WD model) for serious off road traction.  Something not to overlook is the Sequoia burns regular gas, which helps compensate for V8's fuel consumption.  It has a great paint job; ours is a beautiful two-tone Thunder Gray.  The cargo configuration is very flexible, but I wish the 2nd row seats could be completely removed to maximize cargo space. The electric window in the rear hatch is a useful feature.  As one expects from Toyota, it's rattle free, and nothing has fallen apart to date.

But alas, there are some surprising trouble spots.  The huge disappointment is the front seats. Way too soft, the seat cushions narrow considerably to the back, and the back of the seat cushion is flanked by hard plastic pieces that you find yourself sliding over as you exit the vehicle. The seats become uncomfortable after a couple of hours on the road. (We have the optional 8 way power seats.)  Past reviewers have commented positively about the seats, and that has me wonderingï¿½  Did Toyota change something in the wrong direction for 2002?  Check them out for yourself.  I think you'll find them soft and cozy for the test drive.  It's on a long run that the overly soft cushions become apparent. The front row head rests lack any tilt adjustment and they are too far forward. I'm 6'-2" and they don't bother me, but my 5'-2" wife is bothered by them.   Other complaints: The engine idles too fast for some reason. The brakes require excessive pedal pressure in normal stopping and the pedal is to high in relation to the gas pedal.  The gas pedal is too close for tall drivers like me.  I wish Toyota would adopt Ford's adjustable pedals.  Here's one that is inexcusable.  Some switches (e.g. side mirrors, door locks, cruise control) are not illuminated for night driving.  The power radio antenna Toyota installs is not appropriate on this relatively tall SUV; it hits entering most any garage.  An in-glass mount diversity antenna should be used.  Overall, the quality of the interior plastic and carpeting could be better.  The Limited model's interior trim is little better than the SR5, and the metal tone plastic look is not appealing.  The seats are no better.  So we went with the much less expensive SR5.  A minor quirk, the Low fuel lamp illuminates too soon; with 4 gallons (26 gal capacity) remaining.  The rear side storage compartment cover is an awkward design.  The intermittent wiper time control works backward from intuitive.  The steering becomes too light with heavy load in back, but it's perfect with light loads.  A heating system box intrudes on right front passenger foot room. More granularity in the tilt steering wheel adjustment is needed. The standard 6 speaker Stereo is tuned for booming bass, although it is OK overall. I would much prefer console mounted shift lever and parking brake, like the Landcruiser uses...a good example of the contrast between the Japanese produced model (Landcruiser), and the Americanized layout on the Sequoia.  Hey Toyota, just because Ford and Chevy do it that way, you don't have to copy it.
