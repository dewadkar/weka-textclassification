            I recently purchased a brand new 2004 Dodge SX 2.0 in Bright Silver.  (I am Canadian, but I believe it's still known as the Dodge Neon in the United States, although I could be wrong!)  I couldn't be happier with it.  The base model is equipped with such standard features as a 2.0L 4 cyl. engine, with an output of 132 horses, fog lights, six speaker AM/FM CD player, tilt steering, air conditioning and much more.  The model I purchased is a base model with the optional 4-speed automatic transmission, 15" cast aluminum wheels, a trunk lid spoiler and the security group which consists of power door locks, remote trunk release and two transmitters which lock and unlock the car.  It's also equipped with the Sentry engine immobilizer system.  I paid approximately $15,000 with a down payment of $2,000 and my trade.  The financing is 0% for 60 months.  I also do not have to pay for 90 days.  The incentives for buying a new car right now are wonderful.

The car drives like a dream.  The handling is crisp and precise, with the almost go-kart like feel of my previous car, a 1998 Dodge Neon.  The SX is much more refined, however.  The interior is made up of heavy vinyl, and deluxe black fabric covers the seats.  The window frames cut out the wind noise at high speeds, and the insulation minimizes excess road and engine noise, making for a nice, quiet ride.

I bought this car for a few reasons.  First and foremost, it is economical.  Second of all, it looks great!  The quality of the Dodge SX 2.0 is a far cry from the early model Neon.  Daimler Chrysler has made many improvements.  It was also the only car in it's class that afforded me the most bang for my buck.  I have yet to find any faults with it.
