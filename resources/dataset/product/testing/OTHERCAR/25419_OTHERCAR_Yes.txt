            I'll probably never look at driving the same way because this was the car I learned to drive on.  I still can't think of a single thing to complain about, and I've never driven another car that came near to this one.  I couldn't hear a noise while driving with the windows closed, the handling is superb, the seats literally adjust everywhere to conform to your body, and while this car may be expensive it is worth every dollar.

Everything inside the car is easy to find and easy to use, including the excellent sound system that comes with it.  Almost everything is controlled automatically, something that may not seem important, but if you have ever tried to drive a car without it quickly becomes priority.  It is fun to drive and really just plain looks good, which is important if you are trying to enjoy your car.

But even if the attractiveness and convenience of this car alone doesn't impress you, it is also equipped with all the state of the art safety systems, and has great visibility for the driver.  There is plenty of room inside the car, ensuring the comfort of all the passengers and leaving enough space to carry any reasonable amount of goods, even if the car is full.

The only problem that I can see with this car is the price (the only reason I don't have my own), and it only gets worse if the car breaks down, something that can happen in spite of good manufacturing and maintenance.  If this car is something that barely fits into your budget, I don't recommend it because the parts and labor cost a lot more on this car, not to mention the car insurance!

However if you can afford the car and the correct maintenance for it, go for it.  I don't think you'd find a more comfortable or better car on the market (except perhaps the new model).<br><br>
