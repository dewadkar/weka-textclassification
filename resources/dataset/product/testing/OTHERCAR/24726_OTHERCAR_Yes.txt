                The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC S70 has capabilities that far surpass their bulky, low-resolution predecessors.  It yields the sleek look and feel of a good quality SLR 35MM Camera.  It has a lens capable of 3x optical zoom.   It accepts external flashes and lens attachments, which definitely provide you with more creativity control.  You can purchase zoom, wide angle, and fish eye lenses for this digital camera.  
     This 3+ megapixel camera offers excellent image quality and can yield enough detail for even 11 X 14 Prints.  The detail this camera is capable of putting out is incredibly sharp.   It allows you to set your own ISO, as well as exposure settings and it has manual focusing capabilities. This camera allows me to produce high-quality, well-focused images.  The camera is very affordable too.  It is definitely worth the money I spent on it.The only complaint I have is that it did not come with its own case.  
     Another good thing about this camera is its capacity for memory.  It uses a memory stick.  It fairly small but it provides substantial storage capabilities. This is so much better than the floppy disk method of storage. It comes with a 8MB memory stick, but you can get them as high as 64MB. I was a big skeptic at first because the pictures I had observed that were taken by digital cameras lacked quality, creativity, and more importantly detail.
This camera changed my perception of digital photography.  
     This camera is fairly easy to use.  Occasional reference to the user manual may be necessary in some cases, but for the most part it is pretty self-explanatory.  It has a good number of features that are quite enjoyable to use.    It is quite practical too.  The LCD screen allows you to preview your pictures right away.  If you do not care for a certain picture you can delete it and replace it with something else.      
  Digital cameras are claiming their rightful heir to the camera realm.  Digital photography is a technology that is continually emerging and improving.  To say the least digital cameras have come a long way and I am extremely happy with mine.
