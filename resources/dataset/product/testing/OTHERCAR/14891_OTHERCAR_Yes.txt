            This camera is great as a stand alone digital camera, it takes normal floppy 3.5&quot; disks, it can internally format them, and it has many picture altering features, such as sepia and solarize.  It is NOT effective in low light situations, the viewfinder is impossible to see through and it cannot focus unless the light is good.  The flash mechanism is far too bright, and useless because if it is dark enough to use the flash, you can't see what you're shooting anyway.  It is a wonderful camera for vacationing, I took mine to italy and came home with almost 400 pictures, disks can hold up to 40 depending on file type and disk format.  There is a very useful delete feature for those shots of your thumb or feet, and it has an &quot;auto off&quot; feature that shuts it down after several minutes inactive to conserve battery power.  Runs about 3 hours on a fully charged battery in view mode, less in camera mode.<br><br>
