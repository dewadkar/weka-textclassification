            I bought my G20 back in February '99,  and in November I had put over 20,000 miles on it.   The car still runs like new and I've been generally pleased:

Good:
1) Comfort...  One of the most comfortable cars I've been in.  The driver's seat has &quot;auto-adjust&quot; controls so getting comfortable is easy.  
2) Roomy... My friends in the back never complain about leg or head room.  Careful though, the car isn't very wide so fitting three in the back is tough.
3) Trunk space... the trunk is huge.
4) Sound... It comes with a incredible CD and Cassette Bose sound system (standard).
5) Price... definitely one the most affordable luxury car on the market.

Bad:
1) Steering...  This car has the absolute worst turning radius i've ever experienced.  If you didn't know better, you'd think you were driving an 18-wheel big rig.  Parking is tough and u-turns are scary.
2) 4 cyclinder engine...  The four cyclinders don't give you very much starting power, although if you push the car to its limits, you get some good pick-up.  However, unlike most four-cylinders, the G20 gives you great acceleration at high speeds (a necessity for hi-way driving).

Would I buy again?
-- Dollar for dollar, I don't think you can find a better car...
