            I purchased the 1999 Hyundai Elantra in mid-July, right before I drove it all the way out to Illinois from NYC.  I've had my car for nearly 6 months now, and no complaints.  In fact, I think it's one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.  I bought the car mainly for getting around in grad school, and it's been a solid buy for me.  The car is not only gas efficient (which is ALWAYS a concern for the money-conscious grad student!), it's easy to maneuver.  It's a great size (small enough to park, big enough to feel safe), and has plenty of legroom for everyone.  I'm also in grad school in a place where it snows and ices up a lot, and to date, I have had no problem with the weather.  The car drives amazingly well!  All I can say is, GREAT bargain!!!  For a car this good, paying $12,000 brand new was a steal!<br><br>
