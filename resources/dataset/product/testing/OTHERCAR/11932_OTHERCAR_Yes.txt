            3 days ago, I received my AGFA780c.  Keeping in mind that I am very new to the digital camera world, I found the camera to be very user friendly.  The only problem I had was not getting the pictures to view on the computer.  After playing around with the baud rate, which was set for 113000, down to 9200, I had no problems whatsoever.  I did notice how fast the camera does use up batteries and I will be investing in the batteries that recharge and the charger.  I am able to get absolutely clear pictures for use on auction sites even at 320 x 240.  I find myself also patting myself on the back when I figured out how to use pictures I have taken and putting them into a screen saver program. I am pleased with the camera and would definitely suggest the camera to my friends and relatives.  Nice and easy to use.<br><br>
