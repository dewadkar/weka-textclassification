            In 1997, a friend of mine bought a RAV4, and I thought it was the cutest car I had ever seen!  About a year later, my Geo Prism was on its last legs, so my husband and I went car shopping.

The only car I really wanted to look at was the RAV4 (which probably didn't help my deal any).  Although it probably is a little over-priced, I love my RAV, and can't imagine what car would work better for me.

It handles great, more like a car than a truck. I live in the mid-west, and my RAV has weathered several bad snow and ice storms, and gotten me back home safely. It's a very dependable car--I have had no trouble with it in 2 1/2 years. 

The pick-up on the highway isn't the greatest, but more than adequate, and my two kids fit fine in the back seat, although it is cramped for adults.  My only real complaint is the cupholder (or lack thereof).  In the 1998 model, there is only one cupholder in the whole car, and it is awkwardly positioned in the middle front console.  I understand Toyota has fixed this minor problem. (and, if the cupholder is the biggest problem, you can see that it's a pretty great little car)

Anyone looking for a great, dependable, all-weather car, RAV 4 is the one.  If you need to transport more than one adult, (especially if they all will have a drink with them!) you might want to find a car with a bigger backseat.
