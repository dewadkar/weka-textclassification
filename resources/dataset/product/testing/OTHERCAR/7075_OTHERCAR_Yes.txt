            This camera has so many features that anyone from a novice to the seasoned pro would fall in love with this camera.  Easy to use.  Works on both the Macintosh and the PC.  USB connection is fast.

Go out and get one of these NOW!  It's a great deal online.  I bought mine on auction for just over $500.  Can't beat that price.

The best part of this camera is that not only does it capture still images, but it also captures 80 seconds of video.  Wow!  Who could ask for anything more?

Digital cameras have finally come to a point where the photos are clear and bright and worth the money you'll spend on one of these cameras.

This is one of the best!
