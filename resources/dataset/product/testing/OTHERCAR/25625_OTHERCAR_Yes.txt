   When I was looking to buy a sedan, I strongly considered the Saab 9-5; I loved its sporty handling and apperance, as well as it luxurious feel and impeccable safety record.  However, I was able to get a fully equipped Platinum edition of the Toyota Avalon for less money.  Despite this purchase, I was still very enchanted with the 9-5, and I was quite excited at the prospect of a wagon version of the car.  Well, the Saab 9-5 Wagon is here and I honestly like the look of it even more than I liked the appearance of the sedan.  Probably the sportiest of the European wagons hitting the US market, the 9-5 Wagon comes with a premium stereo system, including a CD/Casette player.  In addition, even the base model comes standard with a sunroof, which none of the other wagons offers as a standard feature.  Actually, the Saab Wagon only comes in two models - one with a turbo-charged V4 engine, and a more expensive one with a turbo-charged V6 engine (which comes standard with leather and traction control by the way).  I was hesitant to consider the V4 model because I hate cars that are underpowered, but much to my surprise, the V4 was one of the most nimble cars I've ever driven!  The pick-up was great, and the Sport mode (S mode) provides one with a boost of acceleration when trying to pass a car or get onto a freeway.  In terms of cargo capacity, the Saab rivals the Audi, and has about 73 cu. feet of storage (with the middle seats folded down).  In addition, the rear leg room was especially ample, which is great for long-legged passengers like myself.  Inside, the wagon feels sort of like an airplane, which makes sense since Saab does construct airplanes as well.  The driver's seat is positioned well, provided the driver with great back support.  Saab was thoughtful and decided to place some radio controls on the steering wheel - a feature I feel is very convenient.  Like all Saabs, the ignition is located on the center console, and while this may seem weird/quirky, it actually prevents one's knee from getting damaged in an accident (in other cars, one's knee would be rammed into the keys hanging out of the ignition during an accident).  All seats are bucket-like and the leather has a distinctly Saab-like quality to it - not especially plush, but rather supportive.  Like the Audi A6 Avant, there's two cupholders in the front, and two in the rear, and folding down the seats is a cinch.  However, I feel that the A6 Avant has two minor advantages over the Saab. First, you can't get four-wheel drive on the Saab - at best, you can resort to using traction control or the Winter mode to give you extra traction.  This may suffice, but I feel better knowing I have four-wheel drive if I need it.  Second, Saab doesn't offer to cover maintenance during part of the lease (and Audi does).  However, the Saab offers a better sound system, a sportier feel and handling, and a standard sunroof, which the Audi does not.  It's really a trade off, since the cars (when similarly equipped) lease for about the same price.  One really can't go wrong with either - they're both excellent wagons.  It's really just a matter of personal preference.  But I would strongly suggest that people should consider the Saab 9-5 Wagon in addition to considering the Audi.  And one more thing - if you live on Long Island and are confused about what Saab dealership to go to, I would suggest North Shore Saab (in Glen Head) or Garden City Saab.  The people at Karp Saab in Rockville Centre are obnoxious, inept, and are especially reluctant to help women car-buyers.  <p>
