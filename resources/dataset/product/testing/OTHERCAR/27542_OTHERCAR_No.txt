            The 96 grand cherokee was redesigned, however it still cannot seem to escape its previous shortcommings. I bought this vehicle used with about 80,000 miles on the clock. Although it is a very capable offroad machine, one cannot help but wonder when the machine will break down. I admit the high mileage may contribute to some of the problems I faced, however it is getting quite rediculous. At 82,000 miles the a/c compressor went kaput, resulting in a 500 dollar repair bill. At 85,000 miles the front pinion bearing started whining at freeway speeds (due in part to the full time 4wd) At 88,000 miles the check engine light mysteriously comes on and then turns off, a download of the computer reveals no faults. At 90,000 miles the transmissions lock up torque converter feature fails to unlock, resulting in jerky downshifts etc... And finally at 101,000 miles the jeep fails to start completely. Changed distributor as prescribed by local mechanic, still no start...the saga continues with maintenance including a failed fuel pump. 
When this truck is running however it runs strong, handles very well, is extremely comfortable and the 4wd is outstanding, especially in the rocks, and snow. I am only 22 years of age, however one lesson I have learned in my short driving career; buy japanese vehicles! Particularly toyotas or hondas. I understand the pride people take in buying american, but you must be ready to swallow some "hidden costs" when purchasing such vehicles. I happened to know the previous owner of the jeep and he was meticulous about upkeep, as was myself, and she still failed me over and over again. Just look up the website www.nagca.org (national grand cherokee association) and you will see a lengthy list of annoyed grand cherokee owners.
