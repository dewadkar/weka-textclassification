            The Clicksmart 310 is a great concept!  However, it is unfortunately not all it claims.  It is shaped and modeled after a handheld camera but with the ability to be used as a PC camera as well.  It is a great idea, but the still pictures on this camera really aren't anything at all to get excited about.  

I bought this camera to take pictures of stuff when listing on eBay.  I shortly found out it was not going to work that great.  I just didn't feel the pictures were clear enough to post.  Maybe for someone who doesn't expect much it would be good ... oh well.  Getting a 3.1mp Olympus digital cam didn't help any either.  

Anyway ... here are the specs ...

Store 160 photos and about 15 seconds of video (batteries drain quick though) ... 2MB Memory
Use as a webcam / PC Camera to video conference
Software to use as a webcam and create albums
Easy to download images to pc
2 year warranty from Logitech (pretty standard for Logitech)
USB cable connection
The Logitech website says Motion Detection software, but the camera is not compatible
CMOS sensor at 352x288
Base which swivels (better design than older Logitech webcams ... the ball type which would constantly fall off the computer)
Comes with lens cover and wrist strap
Takes 4 AAA batteries ... they don't last all that long
Still image is taken at 352x288
Video capture at 176x144
Has a self timer of 10 sec
The webcam portion is 640x480 and runs about 30fps
It is compatible with Windows 98 and later
Recommended 64MB RAM, 200MB free hard drive space, Pentium II 400 or higher, CD Rom, Windows compatible sound card and speaker

No mic

It is overall a pretty good webcam.  However, the pictures really are nothing to look at.  With all the other webcams out now ... even other Logitech stuff, this will soon be not even worth it.  By the way, my ended up on eBay because I didn't use it for its intended purpose.

Well .. happy hunting!
