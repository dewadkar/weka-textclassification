            I lease my Honda Accord because the price is right for me. I am a working mother with two teenagers and a husband and it has enough room for all of us. Its great to drive. I feel very comfortable and safe driving the Accord. This is my 3rd Honda and I wouldn't buy anything else. I have a 6 cylinder and it's good on gas. I think any family with two children would feel great driving in this. There is plenty of room in the trunk for groceries, plants, or luggage. There is even a opening in the back where the arm rest is for the kids to get their stuff out of the trunk on long trips. The back folds down if you wanted to put more stuff in the trunk. I would highly recommend the Honda Accord.<br><br>
