            I bought my '99 Neon used, with about 21,000 miles on it. I got a great deal on it. I strongly believe the Neon is the best car you can buy in the $10,000 to $15,000 price range. 

I've put over four thousand miles on my Neon since I bought it, and there hasn't been a single problem. This car is extremely quick and nimble for such a low-price automobile. Not only is it fast, it handles like a dream. The base suspension is tight and responsive and yet forgiving and comfortable at the same time. Even though I have the smaller two-door coupe model, I often drive my friends around comfortably. The rear seats in the coupe aren't the roomiest, but they're far from uncomfortable. 

One advantage to owning a Neon that you probably won't hear about in many places is the enormous community that surrounds these cars. Neon owners form one of the largest, kindest, closest-knit communities of enthusiasts I've ever seen. Furthermore, the list of custom after-market modifications and accessories made for Neons is staggeringly large.

Neons are also very safe cars to drive. Driver and passenger airbags are standard, and the Neon's tough frame can really withstand an impact. Only last week, my Neon was rear-ended at a stoplight by another car. The car that hit me was traveling at around 40mph. Myself and the two passengers in my car were unharmed, and amazingly, the only damage to my Neon was to the bumper. The other guy's car was smashed beyond repair. I was able to drive off relatively unscathed, thanks to my Neon's superior construction. <br><br>
