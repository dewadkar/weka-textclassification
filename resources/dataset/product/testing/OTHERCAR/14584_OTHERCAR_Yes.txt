            I am lucky enough to be the owner of a 1991 Honda Accord EX automatic, purchased new.

Never before have I ever loved a car like this!  I can honestly say that if something happened to my car, I'd be at a loss as to where to start to look for a new one.

The ride at 136,000 miles is just as good as it was at the 16 it started with.  Gas mileage ranges from 25 to 35 on the highway and 20 to 25 in the city.  And with gas prices breaking the $2.00 range here, it's quite nice to be able to go far on your dollar!  My interior has held up very well except for a few mishaps with spilt items and some sun-fading on the upholstery in the back window.

I have been lucky enough to only have two problems with my Honda.  The first seems to be the rust that appears in the same spot on all the other Hondas of the same age group in my area.  The wheel well on both sides of the car seem to be the number one spot.  If you care for your paint in advance you can avoid some of the rust, but even having had the car rustproofed at purchase and keeping the car clean and waxed about 95% of the time, my rust is just starting to appear.

The second problem I've faced is a few transmission problems.  The "brains" of the transmission have been replaced twice, but I've learned a short-cut!  If the sports light flashes (indicating a possible transmission problem), simply disconnect the battery terminals for approximately 10 minutes.  This action will reboot all the onboard computers and usually solves the problem.

Overall, no other car has the same amount of leg and shoulder room as my Honda Accord.  I installed my own stereo and cd changer to improve upon the factory install.

I expect that this car will continue to serve me well for at least another five to seven years.  I simply treat it well and get the regularly scheduled maintenance and she's never let me down!
