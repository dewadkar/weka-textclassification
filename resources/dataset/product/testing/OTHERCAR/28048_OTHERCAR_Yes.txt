            I'm currently 17, and I've recently purchased my first car, a 1995, SOHC, Automatic, Black, Plymouth, Neon, Sport, Coupe.  I love this car, and I couldn't amagin driving anything else.  When looking for a car, I wanted a neon, but I also test drove a few other cars.  I continued returning to a dealer down the road from my home until he got the car I wanted.

I haven't had too many problems with this car.  My head gasket began to leak just before 90,000 miles, not bad for a neon.  I had a rust hole in the muffler, the rear brake pads were worn down, door speakers rusted to death. these were defects.  I accidently broke the left wiper arm, and had to get the windshield re-sealed because the previous owner had it done improperly, and it leaked.  I also had the A.C. recharged, and I need new rear struts.

These may seem like alot of problems, but try to keep in mind that this is a used 95 neon from Mass.  I have no idea of its past history, but its only recall has been addressed.  Even though alot has happened since i got it, most was covered by a 1 month dealer warranty, and I absolutely love the car, I couldn't live without it.

I pay for the car and insurance, and I don't mind it a bit.  I have a few co workers who drive neons, and a bunch of people drive them at school.<br><br>
