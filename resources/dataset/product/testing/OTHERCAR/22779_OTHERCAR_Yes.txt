            I purchased our Aurora after a vacation to San Diego were the car rental agency put us in an Aurora for a week, It was a splendid week!
I can't say enough about the comfort the car provides on long journeys, The motor is an absolute dream, A very nice combination of smoothness, Power and decent fuel economy &quot;about 25 Highway cruising at 80+mph &quot; for a large car.
The dash cockpit layout is very nice &quot;Personally this is my favorite single item about the car&quot;.
The seats are well padded and the shape and power controls make it easy to get comfy and stay that way for extended trips.
I love to take the car on long trips, We now drive to many places that we used to fly to.
The shape and styling of the body is my least favorite items however, these items are totally subjective and most other people that comment on it like the looks.
The problem areas I have had with the car include an Air Conditioning Compressor replacement at 30,000 miles, 2 new Oil Pressure sending units, Fuel gauge problem &quot;The dealer told me I was overfilling the tank&quot; They turned out to be right, I now stop fueling when the nozzle click the first time and round of to the next $ and have not had any more trouble.
The stock Goodyear Tires are horrible! They offer poor cornering and lousy bad weather grip, I have replaced them with Michelin XGT-H4's and it made A world of difference.
Power Steering Pump replacement at 42,000 miles.
When it is time to replace the brakes on an Aurora, Do not try to have the rotors turned, I was warned against it but decided to have mine turned, Big mistake, They warped within days and I wound up replacing the rotors anyway.
The car has a very large turning radius &quot;a small price to pay for such a nice automobile&quot; witch make it difficult to park in tight lots.  
If you are considering the purchase of an Aurora a couple of recommendations I would give you are: 
Get the Bose Sound System &quot;The standard stereo is not very rich sounding.&quot;
And also opt for the Autobahn Package that includes Michelin Tires, 135 mph Speed governor and a Lower overall  Gear Ratio &quot;Quicker acceleration&quot;.
My car has none of these features &quot;Unfortunately&quot;, But, I have driven an Aurora that does and it sure up's the &quot;Fun Factor.&quot;
And finally DON&quot;T PAY TOO MUCH FOR ONE! With huge rebates and large dealer discounts you can expect to get roughly $8,000 off of the Sticker price.<br><br>
