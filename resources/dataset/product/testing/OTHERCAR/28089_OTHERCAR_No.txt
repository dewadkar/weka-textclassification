            I am very confused as to why people are writing positive reviews about this camera.   I have a 2.2 megapixel camera and I've been wanting to upgrade to a 4++ megapixel camera and this seemed like a good deal -- it was also recommended by the Circuit City guy.

Pro:
- Ok, it takes good pictures.   The quality of the pictures are very nice, inside and out.
- I liked the movie mode, was easy to get a movie started and stopped.   Not great quality, but good enough (with sound) for its purposes.

Cons: (Too many to mention, but here are a few)
- Battery burned VERY quickly - after only an hour or so of playing with the camera, the lithium battery told me that I couldn't use the screen any more
- Shutter time -- after you click to take the picture, it often take 1-2 seconds before it TAKES it.   Horrible and useless for any type of action shot.    
- What you take a picture of is NOT what you get.   When you use the LCD monitor (which is horrible too), you often get a picture of something that is a little "off" of what you originally were viewing.   I thought this was because the shutter time was so slow that I moved the camera a little bit - perhaps, but it's still not taking what I originally had on the LCD.   In addition, if you use the viewfinder to take pictures, it gives you a picture that is "further away" than what you viewed in the view finder.
- Batteries.   I didn't spend a lot of time messing around with this, but the camera didn't come with a charger.   I learned after that I could charge it using the USB port, but that's not useful or convenient.   I tried using other AA rechargeable batteries in the camera that I had and they wouldn't work.    If you're going to use this camera (see comment above), you're going to need a bunch of extra batteries..


Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this camera.   I'll be returning this one immediately and getting either the Sony or the Canon 5 megapixel deal..

Good luck to those that use it..

Eric
