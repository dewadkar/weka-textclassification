            What follows is an in-depth analysis of one of the most remarkable automobiles of this generation, the Infiniti Q45 Performance Luxury Sedan.

The concept was a familiar one with a new twist: a premium four-door luxury sedan with the power of a V8. The twist was that this sedan would be as luxurious, well appointed, and as high quality as anything the German manufacturers (BMW and Mercedes-Benz) had ever produced.  Even more interesting is that for the first time in history, such a magnificent machine was to be made in Japan.

Infiniti, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissan Motor Company, sought to be different.  In addition to being extremely well made and very luxurious, their premier flagship was also to have something their primary competitor, the new Lexus LS400, did not: character.

Both the Infiniti Q45 and the Lexus LS400 were to be premier luxury sedans with ample V8 power, top-grain leather, luxurious appointments and spacious seating for four adults.  The differences between these two sedans, however, could not possibly be greater.

The Lexus was engineered for ultimate quiet and silky smoothness, while the Infiniti was engineered to provide a smooth, quiet ride along with truly outstanding handling characteristics.  Both sedans were brought to market (in the US and Canada only) within six months of each other, back in mid-to-late 1989. The Lexus proved to be the smoother and quieter of the two, but the Infiniti was by no means a harsh vehicle.  With their introductions, both vehicles immediately surpassed their other Japanese competitor, the Acura Legend, in terms of luxury, power, price and prestige.

The Infiniti was definitely the muscle-bound prize-fighter of the pack, beating the Lexus LS400 to 60 miles per hour by more than a second.  More importantly, the Infiniti Q45 would carve up curvy roads with the gusto and eagerness of a genuine sports car in a way the Lexus could only dream of.

Another significant difference between the two vehicles was their dramatically different philosophies of style. The Lexus LS400 was a very simple vehicle, stylistically. No dramatic new ground was broken either on the exterior of the car or inside. If one would have imagined an ultra-roomy and ultra-luxurious Toyota with a V8, the Lexus LS400 would probably come immediately to mind (perhaps this was the designers goal?). The exterior was elegant, but hardly exciting. Same with the interior. Simple, understated elegance has been a constant theme in Lexus automobiles, and the original LS400 set the pace in this regard.

The polar opposite of the LS400, the original Q45 sought to be an animal of a different breed. The concept was to produce a very luxurious automobile with a decidedly sporty nature. This meant almost no chrome at all (just the door handles and window surrounds), and a medallion-type emblem in place of a conventional chrome grill. The shape of the body was elegant, yet at the same time very sporty, with rounded corners, a long wheelbase, and a long sloping hood with strong vertical character lines.  The overall impression was of a streamlined, vaguely oval shape. Even the door handles were beautifully done ovals in chrome.  The LS400 looked like a stylized brick, while the Q45 looked like it could cut through water like a speed boat.

Q45 Interiors were two-toned, employing combinations of gray and black, white and black, or strongly contrasting shades of light tan and dark chestnut brown.  Yes, the interiors of the original Q45 had character --plenty of it.  Imagine a vehicle with a black and white dash, black and white leather seats, black and white doors, black carpet, a white headliner, and the Infiniti signature round analog clock on the dash, and you might get the picture.  Even today, these early interiors still look fantastic and are very interesting in contrast to the LS400 interiors which were decidedly bland.

Pop the hood of the Q45 and an all-aluminum intake manifold with the Infiniti insignia proudly displayed on top greets you.  This award-winning V8 engine was truly a work of art.  ...32 valves, dual overhead cams, highly-advanced materials, a timing chain instead of the conventional timing belt, and 278 wild horses straining at the reins.  Yes, the first generation Q45 was a genuine rocket ship.

The LS400 was powerful as well, but the difference is in the nature of the delivery of that power. The LS400 was silky smooth, providing the majority of it's punch in the mid-range to high end of the rev-range.  Conversely, the Q45's power peak was lower in the powerband.  This meant the Q was capable of spectacular launches from a standstill, while the LS400 was far less dramatic.

Handling is another important issue with (again) many differences between these two vehicles.  Without going into the technical details between the two, let me just say that to drive a LS400 is to drive a Japanese Lincoln, whereas driving a Q45 is more like driving a BMW sport sedan.  Neither vehicle really feels anything like a Mercedes-Benz (although Lexus has stated that their goal is to compete directly with Mercedes).

As for comfort, both cars pamper to the utmost levels of luxury.  Close the door of either car and outside noise all but disappears.  The leather used in the Lexus is slightly softer than that found in the Infiniti, but for some reason the Infiniti Leather seems to have stood up better against the test of time.  Ten-year old examples of these cars tell their own story.  The leather on either car will be creased, but that in the Lexus will probably be cracked and peeling, whereas the Infiniti leather is more likely to look great.

Both vehicles offer outstanding audio systems, with my personal preference being the Bose system found in the Infiniti.  I have always been a big Bose fan, having owned a set of Bose 901 loudspeakers years ago.  Both cars are spacious, with the Infiniti having one significant design flaw: the rear passengers toes cannot fit beneath the seats of the front seats.  This means that while rear-seat leg room is good, foot room is not.

An interesting design element also contributes to the smallish size of the trunk of the Q45. Instead of being located conventionally (low-slung, behind the rear axle), the gas tank is located behind the rear seat, <i>above</i> the rear axle. This was done for two reasons: first, it provides an added measure of safety by removing the gas tank from a potentially hazardous location (a rear impact in most cars can rupture the gas tank --this is very unlikely in the Q45), and second, it puts the weight of the gas tank directly over the rear (drive) wheels. This latter point contributes significantly to the awesome handling of the Q45. This can be seen either as a benefit (safer, better handling), or as a flaw (less trunk space) --it depends on your point of view and priorities.

These two design elements aside, the Q45 is literally almost flawless in execution.  To date, the only major flaw in it's design has most likely been corrected long ago by Infiniti technicians in most Q4s. A TSB (technical service bulletin) was issued regarding the timing chain guides. These guides have a tendency to break over time (usually sometime after the car hits 100,000 miles). If they break, the timing chain also breaks, wreaking major havoc.  If you are considering purchasing a first-generation Q45, I urge you to find out if the guides were replaced or not. If not, get them replaced ASAP.

A few model variants were produced, and some are more desirable than others. Probably the least desirable is the relatively rare <b>Q45a</b>.  This car employed an advanced &quot;active suspension&quot;, hence the &quot;a&quot; tacked on to the Q45 nameplate.  This suspension automatically leveled the car during turns, braking, and acceleration.  The problem with this system is that it is slightly slow to react.  I'm only talking about a few fractions of a second here, but none the less, it is irritating at times.

The system self-adjusts the shock damper valving (i.e. damping pressure) 5 times per second.  This might sound like a lot, but when compared to the new, similar system found on the 2000 Mercedes-Benz CL500, this is very slow. The Mercedes-Benz system self-adjusts something like 48 times per second (I think) --a lot faster anyway. The system is expensive to fix if it breaks (I've heard it is quite reliable, though). This was a $5,000 option, and as a result, the Q45a commands a premium in the marketplace. I seriously doubt, however, if the extra money is worth it.

A far more desirable option is the Touring package, denoted by the letter &quot;t&quot; following the Q45 nameplate (&quot;<b>Q45t</b>&quot;).  This package consists of a firmer suspension, limited-slip differential, lower-profile tires, a rear spoiler, and other minor trim tidbits.  The Q45a is the genuine sports car of the lot, providing a firmer ride, and even more nimble handling, with only a marginal penalty in ride quality and road noise. If I were to seek out a used, first-generation Q45 for purchase, it would be a Q45t without question.

As far as cosmetic changes go, there are several worth noting:  1994 saw the end of the grill-less nose of the Q45. The 1994 model was considerably more elegant in appearance than the 1990-1993 models, as a chrome grill was added and the front end was resculpted. The interior colors were changed as well for 1994:  the two-tome treatments disappeared, giving way to monochromatic interiors in either black, tan, or gray. Yes, the Q45 matured a little, but it also gave up some of its character at the same time. I really love those early 2-tone interiors. Lastly, also in 1994, additional chrome trim was added to the exterior. Most people liked the additional chrome, but I personally never cared much, either way. I guess, if asked, I would say that I liked the interiors of the earlier (1990-1993) Q45s better, but I liked the exterior of the 1994-1996 cars better.  Go figure.  Some people are never happy, ya know? :-)

Both the Lexus LS400 and the Infiniti Q45 provide plenty of luxury, power, refinement, prestige, and quality for your money. However, the Q45 adds a healthy dose of character to the mix that the Lexus LS400 lacks, in my humble opinion (in fact, I see it as a glaring omission in a premium automobile). This remains true to this day, with the current generations of both cars. The 2000 LS400 is very nice, but a little dull (think stuffed-shirt), while the 2000 Q45 Anniversary Edition is loaded with both style and character (not to mention an adjustable sport suspension-!).

In case you can't tell by now, The Q-ship is one of my all-time favorite cars. I think it is grossly under-rated by both the public and the motoring press in general. In my opinion, a nicely-kept example of a 1995 Q45t <i>is</i> the ultimate driving machine (sorry BMW --not this time).

Thank you for reading my Epinion!I hope you enjoyed reading itm and that you found it to be both entertaining and informative.  Please rate it highly if you liked it!  :-)<br><br>
