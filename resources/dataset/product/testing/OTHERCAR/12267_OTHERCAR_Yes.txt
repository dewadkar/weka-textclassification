            This Mazda 626 ES V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission is a phenomenal car. One of the most exceptional things about the car is the outstanding acceleration of the car. No matter what gear your in, its got awesome amounts of power. The 5-speed manual is also a very smooth shifter, making expert-like shifts commonplace. The transmission, however, does get jerky sometimes, especially when in 1st gear. The ride is quiet, but a little bumpy. Steering is okay, but is a little too light and is not lighting quick. Handling is good, with not too much body roll and sufficient amounts of grip. What is most amazing about the car is the value. I purchased a ES V6 equipped with the 5-speed, leather interior, a sunroof, in-dash CD player, power drivers seat, power mirrors, locks and windows, air conditiong with swinging vents, tilt steering wheel, fold-down rear seats, and 15-inch alloy wheels in good condition with 98,000 miles for a mere $3,600. After inspection, there was only minor problem that only costed about $100. Fit and finish, however, might be a different story. The sunroof had a problem opening on occasions, requiring a pencil to open it, although it does work fine now. The inside door frame, however, was pulled off one day, with a bit of tugging. It was put back on though easily, and has been doing fine ever since. Those are the only problems I've experienced although I just purchased it about a month ago. Everything else works great. All the power options work, the stereo and cd player are great, the trunk is roomy, the back seat is comfortable, visibilty is good. Overall, the car is absolutely phenemonal. It provides sports car like speed with 4-door practility and Mercedes-Benz like luxury with a Geo Metro like price tag.
