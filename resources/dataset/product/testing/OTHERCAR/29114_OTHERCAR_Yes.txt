            Without a doubt, Toyota stands out among all the rest.  I had BAD experiences with my old Chevy S10, so this was such a refreshing change.  
My Tacoma looked just like the black one pictured, with the big tires making it look (and it is) very powerful.  It is a very hot looking vehicle.
But beyond looks, this truck outperforms any in its class. Having only a 2.7L, 4 cylinder engine didn't hinder this truck at all.  I used it to commute, haul, and just drive around in.  There was nothing this vehicle couldn't handle.  Snow here is not a problem with this truck.  It never even slipped, even just a little bit.  Well...while I wasn't around, the hubby even took it out for a spin in the mud.  Hated that since it was so pretty, but the boys had a blast.  Needless to say, they came home in the Toyota and didn't have to be pulled out.
This truck didn't have too many convenience or comfort features, since the price paid went toward performance and craftsmanship Toyota is known for.  My only problem here was that the seats, though a nice looking cloth, are not plush at all.  Other than that, I was pleased.
Considering this was a 4X4 with bigger tires, I was surprised at the gas mileage it got.  VERY good compared to trucks in previous years.  Insurance rates also were very good.  
Past tense in this review only means the vehicle went with the X--and I miss the truck so much!
