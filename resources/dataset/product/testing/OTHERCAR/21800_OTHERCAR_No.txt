            When I bought my Chevy Tahoe I thought it was an impressive vehicle.  It wasn't two days and the vehicle had an injection problem. It seemed as though there was always something wrong with it.  I was disappointed with the service from Chevy and the parts delays. I paid over $30,000 for the vehicle and I expected it to perform satisfactorily.  

I always had to prove to the service department that something was wrong with it when I took it in for warranty work.  The universal joint went out on it and I had to take them for a ride to show them and they still didn't believe there was anything wrong with it.  The check engine light was always coming on and to solve that they just disconnected it.  What a fix.  

I don't think I could ever have another Tahoe and trust it and be happy.
