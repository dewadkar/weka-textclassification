            The xterra is a well designed vehicle. based on nissan's frontier line of pickups, the xterra handles like (and gets the gas mileage of) a truck. the seats are pretty comfortable, the controls easily accessible, and you really sit high--you can see a lot on the road. i love the manual transmission...it shifts well. the 4 wheel drive also works well. i've only had to use 4wheel low once when i was stuck in snow, and it performed admirably. I suggest that you buy a loaded XE (with the three options packages) and not the SE, because the SE is much more expensive, and only adds a tape deck, sunroof, and leather on the steering wheel. And you can't even use the sunroof when the gear basket is in place.<br><br>
