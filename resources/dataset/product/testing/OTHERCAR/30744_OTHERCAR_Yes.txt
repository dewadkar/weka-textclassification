I purchased my Olympus D-340 R about 6 months ago.  It was my first digital camera purchase, and I did *A LOT* of research before I bought it.  The Olympus seemed to offer the best features for the price.  I didn't want rock-bottom, low-quality cheap, but I also didn't want to spend thousands of dollars for a top-of-the-line digital camera.

I have been very pleased with the Olympus.  It offers good resolution, a good amount of memory- using the lowest resolution, the camera can store about 120 pictures.  I have ordered 4X6 prints of pictures taken at this resolution, and they look pretty good.  If you want better quality pictures, the Olympus D-340 R can store 36 pictures at a time.

The D-340 R also comes with plenty of little bells and whistles- a timer, a setting to take rapid multiple pictures, a setting for close-up pictures, and lots of different views of your stored pictures on the LCD screen.

I have 2 complaints about the camera.  The first is that the LCD screen offers no menu system, and navigating around it can be confusing and I often find myself having to start over while trying to view/zoom in on my stored pictures.

The second complaint is that using the LCD screen really eats away at your battery life. But this is easy enough to work around- minimize your use of the LCD screen, and always be sure to carry extra batteries or invest in rechargeables.<br><br>
