            We bought a 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix in August of 1995.  Our compact vehicle just wasn't cutting it since we had our daughter a few months before.  I had done a little research and asking around, and I found all the Pontiac owners I talked to were impressed with their cars.  I liked both the Grand Am and the Grand Prix models and hadn't decided which to buy when we went shopping.  

When we got to the lot, there was a Grand Am and a Grand Prix sitting side by side, so we did a good comparison.  The Grand Prix had a much larger trunk, front seat and back seat, plus I loved the beautiful blue color of the Prix.  While the design was a little more &quot;grandma-like&quot;, we chose the Grand Prix.  

I loved this car!  The ride was flawless, it had tons of power, it cornered great and outperformed my expectations.  The only drawbacks were that it was very low to the ground, my particular car's alignment was screwed up somehow and we went through a set of new tires pretty quickly, and the brakes squeaked slightly, even after getting new pads.  

This car is great for families.  It fit 6 pretty easily.  The back can fit three carseats and that's quite a feat for any car!  The gas mileage was pretty good also, (23+). If you're single or don't need the room I'd recommend something a little smaller.

Sadly, we no longer own this car; we just needed something with 4WD to get around out here in these tough winters. But boy, when summer gets here I long for my Grand Prix.<br><br>
