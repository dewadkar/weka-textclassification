            When I bought this car, I had just received a nice bundle of cash. I dropped the wad on the Durango and drove away in my first new car ever. And I was debt free. I was giddy.

I bought a Dark Chestnut (Brown) 1998 Durango SLT Plus with all the amenities. Tan leather interior. Third seat. Rear air. Skid plating on the bottom. Big tires. CD player with the eight Infiniti speakers. Running boards. Mmmmmmm, nice.

I got the smaller engine, 5.2 litre V8. Standard side mirrors (not the elephant ears). No engine-block heater. 

One of the features of the SLT Plus is the little computer above the rear-view mirror. Nicely, it tells me the outside temperature, direction, miles until empty, and (gulp) gas mileage. There are few things more depressing that to look up and see the numbers fall to the single digits. 

After the first couple of months (and the first scratch -- ouch!) we took a 1500 mile trip, watching the mileage the whole way. It was tiring just to watch the numbers fall. Mile after mile, we could almost watch the needle drop and hear the sucking sound of the tank emptying. It was painful.

But there are some wonderful aspects about the car. It's big. I can fit all my children (3 carseats) comfortably in the middle seat. More frequently, though, we'll shove two in the &quot;way back&quot; and one in the middle. It really keeps the noise down. And the nice sound system makes it even easier to ignore the whining from the back. Conversely, I can almost ignore the kid's tape I might put on to quiet my little cherubs.

The seats are very comfortable. In fact, they're probably nicer than anything inside the house. The electric action of the driver's seat is a big plus with my wife. The lack of the action in the passenger seat stinks.

The third seat is too small for normal humans, but fine for children. Great for carseats (especially since it's not real leather back there). The little compartment on the floor inside the rear door is a great little perk. We keep a little broom, rags, jumper cables, a kite, the tow hitch, emergency diapers all back there. Nice and out-of-the-way.

There's plenty of power. We towed a trailer 800 miles and hardly noticed any drag. Hills are no problem. We can pass slower, uglier SUVs (like those damned Ford Expeditions) with aplomb. 

Bucking the trend with SUV owners, I have indeed taken the vehicle off-road. The kids love it. My wife doesn't. But bouncing and sliding around in the mud gives my children more laughs-per-mile than any other way. Maybe I'm a bad parent, but I love the sound of toddler laughter from the back seat.

As an off-road vehicle, the Durango has plenty of power. Maybe too much. You sacrifice a good deal of control and finesse, but make up for it in sheer strength. There's no getting stuck in the snow in this puppy. Not with a gazillion pounds of steel pressing down, and a billion horses pulling. That sheer oomph makes the Durango a poor offroad choice for a place like Moab, Utah, where the slickrock trails require a delicate touch. But find a nice muddy field or a mountain log-road and you can let 'er rip. Your children will thank you and all the other soccer moms will secretly spite your inner confidence. (Don't even think about trying that in a Lincoln Navigator!)

I was read-ended by some poor sixteen-year-old in his mother's 1985 Oldsmobile. Poor kid. He was jammin' out to Korn or Rage Against The Machine and plowed into me mid-intersection. His whole front-end was smashed in. His car looked pretty destroyed. My big-daddy Durango had some paint on the bumper. I rubbed it off with a wet sponge. I really liked that part.

The size of the car, however, has been a bad thing in parking lots. Many, many scratches on the doors from people (bad people, not like you) who throw open the doors of their Hondas and scratch poor family men like me. Compared to our other, smaller, commuter car (see my review of our Volkswagen Passat), the Durango is much more dinged up from parking lots. Call it a high ding factor. Ding! Ding! Ding! That's the sound of my paint chipping off.

It's a great car. I'd buy it again. But I don't know how happy I'd feel if I had both a car payment and a gasoline bill every month. Just the gas is bad enough. So, if you buy it, sell your soul and pay cash upfront.<br><br>
