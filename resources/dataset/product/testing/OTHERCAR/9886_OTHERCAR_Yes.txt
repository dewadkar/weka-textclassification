            I purchased my Dakota over a year ago and I am still in love with it.  It has been the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Being a Michigan resident, if you do not have four wheel drive during the winter time, most of the time you have problems getting around.  Not with a Dakota.  I had no problems getting around at all even with the factory tires that come with the truck.  I should mention that mine is two wheel drive as well.  I am a police officer and my work never closes for the winter time so I had to have something that I knew would get me to work regardless of the weather conditions.  I saw many small trucks that were stuck but the amazing thing is, I never saw a Dodge truck stuck anywhere.  
    This truck gives a smooth ride all the time and to be honest, you have to watch your speed when you first get it because it never feels like you are going as fast as you actually are.  So watch your speed until you get used to it.
