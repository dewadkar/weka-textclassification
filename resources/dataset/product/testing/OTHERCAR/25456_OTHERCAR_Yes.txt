            One good part about buying a Saturn is the no-haggle sales approach. What you see on the sticker is what you pay. The downside is Saturn generally does not offer as much on trade.

Saturn offers one of the best cars for the money. A 2000 model SL1 starts at $11,295. Honda Civic DX starts at $12,785 as does the Dodge Neon. Toyota's entry level Corolla starts at $12,418. From what I've seen, they all do well (for their class) in crash tests except the Dodge Neon. The Neon did very poor on side impact crashes.

And speaking of crashes, I have put a '95 SL2 through one. The car does exactly as advertised. Its crumple zones work effectively as do the air bags. The passengers received minimal injuries. 

But the best part about Saturn is what you get for the money. For $1123 lower than the next car listed here, you get a quality car that gets excellent gas mileage without having to fight tooth and nail to get the price you deserve. The SL1 drives and handles well as does the SL2

My most recent Saturn is a fully loaded '98 SL2. It has leather, all the power options, ABS and traction control and a 12 disc CD changer. The total sticker price was just over $18,000. To get leather in a Honda, you have to get an Accord which puts your cash out-put to around $25,000.

If you stick with the basic model, you don't get much but you don't get much with any basic model car. What you do get is extra cash to upgrade a few features if you want such as air conditioning or ABS.

On my SL1, I frequently average 33mph in town and 35 to 40 mph on the highway. The Sl2s get slightly less but I still consistienly get 30 mph in town.

I have owned one SL1 ('95) and two SL2s ('95, '98). They have all performed well without extra maintenance. They are comfortable and economical. I have driven them in snow and ice and they handle just fine.

The most important item, as with any car, is to try to buy with cash-in-hand.<br><br>
