            I bought my Dodge Neon a year ago with 90,000 miles.  I knew that was high miles but a friend of mine bought one brand new and loved hers.  I always thought the looked cute and wanted one since high school.  When I bought it I thought that I was getting a great deal at $4,000.  I have never been so wrong in my life.  Shortly after I bought it I learned it needed a new rack and pinion ($500).  Then it needed a new Oxygen Sensor (I think that was $100).  After that it ran good for a few months and then when the summer came everything changed.  The car would overheat and die after driving for 20 minutes tops.  After putting a new coil box ($80), a new computer (used $50), and a new thermostat (I think that was $25) it still would overheat.  After being in the shop and nothing found wrong with it, it ran good for another month or so.  Then two nights ago (let me tell you this is with 20 degree weather) the car overheats along the highway when I had been driving in town 10 minutes before that and no problems.  I have had nothing but problems with this car and wouldn't trust it to go any farther then I have to.  If anyone else has had this problem and knows what it is I would be more then happy to hear your opinion.  

I will say that the car gets great gas mileage and is roomier then it looks.  The car has also been to Chicago and Georgia but it will never go again.  Or at least with me behind the wheel.  I am currently looking for a new car.  

One last thing to add is that the windows always leak.  Rain don't get in but they whistle when you're driving over 50mph.<br><br>
