            This pickup has good power and acceleration with the V-8. Engine and ride are very smooth. Hills present no problem for this truck. No squeaks or rattles. Milege varies between 15.3 and 19.5 depending on city or highway. Supberb brakes.

There are 3 things I do not like. The center console moves too much when down and the door detents don't work much at all on a hill or if there's a breeze blowing. Could be quicker from a dead stop - could use a lower 1st gear in trans or lower final drive ratio then the 3:91:1. Once the motor winds up some it does make up for the slow start though.

I would highly reccomend the Tundra to anyone who wants a 1/2 ton pickup truck. I feel the ride and quiet are excellent. It is so comfortable that I actually enjoy driving in the SF Bay area again in spite of the traffic. The factory stereo is also excellent. I have slightly over 12k miles on it with no trips to the dealer about anything except the left power mirror that would not go up/down when I got it. I showed up at the dealer a week later and they fixed it on the spot in 45 minutes with no appointment. I refer to it as my Lexus pickup as I feel it's that good. I also like the fact it's easy to park.

As no 3/4 ton is available, if I'd needed a heavy duty truck then I would have had to get a Ford, Chevy or Dodge so you can't compare the Tundra to the big 3's 3/4 ton products. In the 1/2 ton markeplace I consider this truck to be a best buy.
