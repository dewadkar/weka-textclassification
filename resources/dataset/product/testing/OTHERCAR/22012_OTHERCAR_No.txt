            Well, I could finally afford a minivan after years of wanting one for my family.  We found one that we really liked and after some inquiries with some people that had experiences with minivans, we chose the Dodge Caravan.  I absolutely loved my new van!  Until the brake pads wore out at 1,300 miles!  I had them replaced and then they wore out again at 1,800 miles!  So again, it had to go back to the shop for new brakes.  This time they supposedly took the rotors off and inspected them.  This went on for 3 more times with the same results....nothing was fixed!  Then it developed a noise that was never fixed either.  I put up with this for 36,000 miles and had to trade it off (with a loss no doubt).  I suggest if you want a minivan to last, get something other than a Dodge Caravan.  Dodge it for all its worth!<br><br>
