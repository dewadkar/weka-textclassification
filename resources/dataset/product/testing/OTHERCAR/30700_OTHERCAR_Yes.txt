            As I walked into the dealership with the giddyness of a young child, I looked around the showroom at the shiny new cars with their beautiful paint jobs, shiny new rubber tires and plastic bags on their seats.  I new people ( two to be exact) that owned Sunfires and they were completely satisfied with them.  So on a regular tuesday I went hunting for my first brand new car!!!
After I test drove other cars, I found myself at the Pontiac dealership.  As soon as I arrived I knew what car I wanted.  The 2000 black with a sunroof, spoiler and CD player.  And as I eased my anxious body into the bucket seats I was surprised to see that their were features in this car that I never expected to see.  For a four cylinder engine, it has excellent pick up ( I beleive it is a 2.0 or a 2.2), cup holders for your passengers in the back seat, and controls that are at arms length and placed perfectly at the drivers convienence. Being a little closer to the ground, it handles corners nicely, gets and average 15-20 gallons to the mile and is very affordable. 
Even after 7 months of ownership, I still get a feeling of excitement when I get into my car.  I now own a great car that I am not worried about ever breaking down ( and if I did Pontiac has wonderful roadside assistance, so even if I forget to put gas in the car someone will come and rescue me).  I guess that is why they call it Pontiac, Driving excitement. <br><br>
