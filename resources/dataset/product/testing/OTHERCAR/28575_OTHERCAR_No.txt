            A Jeep that really sums up this whole review in a nutshell.  Just by looking at the Vehicle you should know it is not for long dist travel, by that I mean anything that you need to use the interstate for!!!  Though you could as I did very easily talk yourself into saying that the wind, road noise and all that goes with a jeep &quot;really isn't that loud&quot; ya right, but hey if thats what it takes to get the final paperwork done, then that what is has to be!!  I love my jeep and am very happy I bought it, It would be much better as a second car for the summer.  There isn't anything better then taking the top off and Cruising around town.  Convertible doesn't even compare to the Jeep Wrangler.  They do seem to hold there value very well, and I havn't had any problems what so ever.  Course there is only 12,000 mile on it so that is to be expected.
For a second fun vehicle I would very much recommend it, unless of course you can afford that Porsche 959 2000 model I am about to trade my jeep in on!!!  Ya right!!!!  Maybe next year!!!<br><br>
