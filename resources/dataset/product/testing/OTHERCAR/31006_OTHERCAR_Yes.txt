            I first became interested in the Dodge Ram Quad Cab when I saw it on the way from Cape Cod. This is one of the best looking 4 door pickups on the road. This vehicle is great as a work or family car. What else can you want in the car other then 4 doors and cargo space? I test drove Ford SuperCrew and all other quad, supercrew style trucks. None of them convinced me to actual purchase, till release of the new Dodge RAM Quad arrived. 
The 2002 Dodge Ram Quad comes in many trim levels. Two main ones are SLT and SLT Plus. You can also obtain SPORT package that is well worth it on the top of those packages. For 2002 you can choose between V6 (not recommended for this size of truck,) V8 4.7L (new generation engine) and bullet proof V8 5.9L. If you are looking for the full size truck, prepare yourself for bad MPG results. I made the attempt to compare fuel consumption on few of the trucks in the same class and results are very close. I would scratch that category and concentrate on vehicle performance and features. V6 version may be good for daily commuting, but for my taste this engine is just not cutting when it comes to even light load and some basic hauling. 4.7L seems to be good choice for urban driving with some light load, but if you plan to haul boat or to carry some load 5.9L is the way to go. Dodge is coming up with some new engines next year for the new RAM and one that is around the corner is V8 5.2L that may be a new good choice. It is almost as powerful, as current 5.9 with a better mileage. The reason I did not wait for it is that all car manufacturers have a lot of problems with new engines in two first years of production and I rather go with well proven engine.

INTERIOR:

The interior of the car is very functional and specious. Leather package comes in stylish finish and it comes with heated seats. There is also a great cloth interior option that is very close to Ford finish. It is amazing how many hidden storage spaces Dodge placed in this truck that are not available on any other trucks. 60/40 split rear bench is great for carrying some items while having space for passengers. Front and the rear area is equipped with cup holders. SLT Plus package introduces some nice features like 7 speaker Infinity system with center speaker and radio control buttons built in to steering wheel. The Dodge RAM interior also includes power adjustable pedals, which is nice for long distance driving. One of the most amazing things that I learned on the test drive is very specious arm rest that can be used as a seat for a sixth passenger.

EXTERIOR:

The truck�s exterior is very well designed. Adding SPORT package adds a very stylish grill and colored bumpers. There is not much of the third party accessories available yet other then MOPAR ones, but I am getting information that by the end of year more cool stuff will start showing up. Truck has a very nice ground clearance and its massive look is a huge plus. You can choose 20 inch wheels, but from my reading and own test drive it is not the best package for every day driving. To take advantage of $1600 wheels you need to drive primarily on the highway. Going with 17 inch option you will also save a bunch, when it comes down to replacing tires in the future.

MECHANICAL:

5.9L V8 engine is very smooth, but thirsty one. New 4X4 electronic switch option is a nice addition that not only saves 4X4 system, but also clears space on the floor that is taken in the front by otherwise manual shifter. This is the best sounding truck without muffler modification. The best part of buying Dodge Ram now is that you will receive 7 year/ 100000 miles powertrain warranty at no charge and for wrap around coverage is only $1300. 

The Ford F-150 is the top-selling vehicle in America, but now it has a very serious rival. I test drove Ford and could not make a decision to buy it. Dodge addressed almost all my concerns that I had with other truck and all it took is some research and test drive to make a decision to buy. The short bed will certainly make some people hesitate, but Dodge is starting to ship long bed shortly. Part of the dodge Rams appeal to Ex-Ford SuperCrew fans is appearance and versatility that puts this truck on the top of it�s class.
