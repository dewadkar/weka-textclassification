               The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a great car for anyone from a 16 year old to a midlife business man.  The vehicle whitch is very sporty on the exterior, also comes equipped with many saftey features.  

   This vehicle, although a sport utility, rides more like a car.  The ride is smooth and the Jeep handles curves at high speeds relitivley well.  Insurance rates on this vehicle are reasonable compared to other sport utility, the cheapest i was able to find with the exception of the Ford Explorer.

The only problems i had had with my Grand Cherokee are poor gas mileage(expected with any SUV).  Also, even though it is american made, parts for it are hard to get in my area.
