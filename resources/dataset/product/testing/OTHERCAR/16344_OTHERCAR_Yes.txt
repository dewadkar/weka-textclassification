            Tired of buying a roll of film, taking 24 pictures, paying for development and then finding out that only 4 pictures are worth keeping? The HPC200 resolves that issue by saving you hundreds in film and development costs - and if you don't like a picture, just delete it.

When I bought this camera (on close-out), I was intimidated because I knew nothing of digital cameras. But this one is so simple to use, I had my first picture printed within 20 minutes of unpacking the camera.

One mystery with this camera is photograph inconsistency. Some photos are crisp clear, better than those taken with the traditional 35mm. Yet others sometimes look choppy and do not have straight lines in them. Regardless, I have used the camera for thousands of pictures. The real advantage, in my opinion, is being able to take a picture and then check it in the view window to see if another one is needed. 

The only problem I've had with this camera is the port where the parallel port cable connects to the camera. This stopped working after about 6 months. The camera was still under warranty so HP replaced it at no cost, but the technical support representative indicated that this was a common problem with this model.

The battery-life is unreal. I know friends with cameras that have to insert new batteries for every series of pictures that they take. With the new Energizer E2 Photo batteries, I can take and upload nearly 200 to 300 photos before they need replaced.

The camera has three quality settings that may be chosen. The lower the quality, the more photos that can be taken at one given time. For instance, at low quality, you can get take almost 80 pictures. At mid-quality, 40 pictures. For the best quality, you can get about 15 pictures. The lowest quality is adequate for internet use. The mid-level is good for printing, and the highest quality should be used for enlargements.

The telephoto feature does not work too well. I've yet to get a zoomed picture that is clear. The other features do work well and using the small screen and controls to view and delete photos is perhaps the easiest I've ever seen on a digital camera.
