            While the Nikon Coolpix 5000 digital camera screams quality and the price tag screams expensive, the new box comes packed with impressive necessities, and the camera itself with impressive features. For the amateur user, ease of use may not be a favorite quality. Though the picture quality is exceptional and the camera boasts many useful and convenient features,  the instruction booklet is a must read for the not so experienced photographer. As you become more familiar with this camera and its diverse capabilities, I'm sure you will feel much better about the price.

My decision to buy a Nikon Coolpix 5000 digital camera came after months of careful researching and compilation of information and reviews on digital cameras. I bought my Nikon Coolpix 5000 for $1,050.00. Included in the box was the strap, lens cap, starter memory card (32 MB Compact Flash) , USB cable (To transfer photos from the camera to the computer), AV cable, Rechargeable Li-ion Battery, Battery charger, Nikon View 4 CD ROM (a software program to view and edit photos on the computer), Warranty and Registration card and Quick Start Guide. 

The camera's capabilities are just as beautiful as it's razor sharp pictures. The full color LCD monitor swings out in selected position to help capture and maintain the "perfect shot".  After taking the picture(s), you can go back and view them all on the monitor - select the ones you want to keep and/or transfer to your computer, delete the ones you don't want.  Movies can be made both in motion and still.  Numerous image controls and settings are at your fingertips, some of which I still haven't learned yet. There is white and color balance, noise reduction, as well as many accessories to add that can change and/or enhance your project - all this and more. If you're just a beginner and feeling a bit overwhelmed, the instruction booklet will come in handy for understanding every feature at your own pace.  The creativity potential is endless!

I am completely satisfied with the Nikon Coolpix 5000 - my research paid off!
