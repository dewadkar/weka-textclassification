            I bought the 2000 Nissan Sentra SE after much research. As a librarian I have access to many different sources. Although the styling isn't cutesy or sleek, the car is incredibly solid.  It handles curves with incredible accuracy. The car is peppy, too, giving you more power. Driving is a quiet experience in the Sentra. Other cars in its class were loud, rocky and didn't feel anywhere near as safe. I would definitely recommend the SE package over the GXE because the extra power and stability are worth the extra money. 

The dials and controls are easy to see and operate. The 5-speed shifts like a dream.  As a city driver I appreciate that. Nissan gives you a loaded car for the price. Items which are usually options in this car class are standard on the Sentra. The car has a/c, cruise, power windows, door locks, remote entry, and a host of other features.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants an economical vehicle with a great repair record. If you're looking for flash this isn't it, but if you're looking for solid, dependable and surprisingly peppy, try the Sentra. <br><br>
