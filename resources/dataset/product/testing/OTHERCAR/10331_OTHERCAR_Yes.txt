            I used to own a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS Turbo.  It was a great car.  I was the usual teenage kid who really beat up on the car back then, and it ran great all the way till the 195,000 mile mark.  It was the transmission that finally gave out.  It was amazing that it lasted that long, for I went through a set of tires every year from all the wheelspinning I did.  The Turbo engine was a beast.

The car could out accelerate just about every car out there remotely in its price range.  It was also a very capable car in the corners.  I often will pull the emergency brake to lock up the rear wheel while turning and then slam the gas to get all four tires squeeling.  I don't recommend others doing this, but I've done it for years.  As you can see, the car took plenty of abuse.

I ended up selling the car to someone who then fixed it up with a new tranny and drove it around even more.  Then they finally sold it to someone who stripped the car for parts, mainly the engine for its tuning capabilities.

For those who complained of the lack of power, they need to drive the turbo model.  The base model had a whooping 95 HP or so while the turbo model had 190hp and 195lb/ft of torque (which is still amazing to today's standards where a Honda Civic Si only has 170hp and even less torque).

If you're reading this to determine if you want to buy a used one of these, don't buy anything but the turbo model.  Anything else will seem underpowered.  Also though, read about how to drive turbo engines.  If you don't know how to, you WILL damage the engine prematurely.

Also, STAY AWAY FROM THE AWD MODEL.  They may be great for traction, but the AWD system is full of flaws.
