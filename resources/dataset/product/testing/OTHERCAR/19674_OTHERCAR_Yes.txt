            I leased a 1999 Saturn SL in September of 1998.  The people at the Saturn Dealer were very courteous, not too pushy, and aimed to please the customer.  With Saturn, there are no deals or haggling over prices.  You can take it or leave it.  

The car I leased is a four door, with many options available to you at a reasonable price.  For a small car, it is fairly roomy.  My husband, who is 6'3&quot; is very comfortable inside the car.  We drove down to Florida from New York, pushing 75 to 80 miles an hour in this four cylinder car and it handled the ride like a charm.  

In Florida, we visited a Saturn dealer to get a tune up after the long drive, and the dealership in Florida was so helpful and accommodating to us.  As a matter of fact, they performed a check up and oil change in less time than my dealer in New York.

There isn't one thing about this car that I dislike.  It is by far the best investment I have ever made.  Looking for a car, try Saturn!
