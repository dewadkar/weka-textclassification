            I traded in my 1996 Ford Taurus that was a lemon and got a 1999 Mercury Cougar V-6.  Loaded with everything except a sunroof.  The car has preformed excellently.  The brakes are good, and there is a lot of power on demand.  You have to watch yourself on highways, because before you know it you are going 85 MPH.  People always smile when they see it, and the polished aluminum wheels look excellent.  I also like the interior because it looks like one of my favorite cars, the Mazda Miata.  This car also has a great sound system with good bass.  This is the best vehicle I've ever driven, and seen.  At 12,000 miles,it still looks like it was brand new.  I think that a person who wants a great car at a good price and doesn't need a sedan.  Wouldn't it be great if Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT) got hold of the Cougar?<br><br>
