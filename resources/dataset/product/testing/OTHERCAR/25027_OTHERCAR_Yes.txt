            i had one up to satuarday and i tell you i loved it.well i went and got my frist one in 1990 becuase we have three kid's and they were the best for the money.but after i got it i feel in love with it ,it had all the room we needed with the kid's and it was great on long trip's with the kid's.we also got good gas mileage out of it and to me it was like having a car.then in 1995 we went and got one more so like i said i just traded it in on satuarday.if you have kid's and are looking for somthing with room and a good price i say go get one and you'll be happy you did.also if you like to take trips on weekend's or just like to travel alot then i do then it is in you best intrust to that a look at one.<br><br>
