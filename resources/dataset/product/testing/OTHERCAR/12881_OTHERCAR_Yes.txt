            Bought My 1988 Suzuki Samurai in the fall of 1990. After nearly 200,000 actual miles, it still is not using oil. I have four wheeled my little Samurai hard for 8 of the 10 years that I have owned it. Because of this, I had to rebuild the transmission at 110,000 miles. I had to rebuild the started after it sat under water for 15 minutes at 130,000 miles. During this same episode, I also had to replace the alternator bearings. The weakest part on the samurai sit in the front axle. The little CV joints don't like tires bigger the 30X9.50X15 if you install a locker. Axle beefing is a must up front. Other then that, just change your oils and keep it tuned. They are very reliable and their light weight makes them easy to tow. I love mine and have no plans to sell it anytime soon.<br><br>
