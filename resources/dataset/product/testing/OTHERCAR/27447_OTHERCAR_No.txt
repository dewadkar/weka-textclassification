            I first purchased my 1995 Dodge Neon Highline Sport Sedan in Nov 1999.  Yes I know purchasing a used car is probably just asking for trouble from the start, but I needed a car....and fast....  From the moment I test drove it I was in love with it.  So my mother and I purchased it and off I drove in my nice shiny new (but used) car.  

After having the car for a month, the radio decided it didn't like me anymore and quit working.  We thought maybe there was a problem with the fuses, but they were just fine.  My boyfriend at the time was a Dodge Certified Mechanic and he decided he'd just put a brand new radio in for me...that was only the start of my problems...

After installing the radio, (it mysteriously started working) it kept blowing fuses under the hood of my car...so again my car went into the shop.  

After the dealership completely rewired my dashboard, the radio worked for about another 2 months and everything was fine.  Little problems with my car happened (but nothing un normal) and my car was finally starting to show the signs of aging.  

Then for the Fourth of July, my parents, my cousin, my sister's family, and I went to Oklahoma for a vacation.  We chose to take my car and my parents truck.  So my cousin, my sister, her husband, their baby, and I piled into my little car and headed down the road.  

The car did fine on the way there...but the problems started happening on the way home.  First my car wouldn't accelerate, then the radio blew again...just problem after problem until we got home.  

I'm still driving that neon, not because I want to, but because I'm in school I can't afford to go buy another car.  I will have to put up with the car that will catch on fire someday until I'm done with school.  And when I do get done with school, I'll go buy another car and put up with the same problems I'm dealing with now...<br><br>
