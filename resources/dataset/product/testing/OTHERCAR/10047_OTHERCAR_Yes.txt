            Hands down, Lexus automobiles are some of the finest, best built, and most luxurious cars in any price range. For more than 10 years Lexus has been redefining luxury and beating American cars at their own game. By the early 1990s, American automakers where gradually phasing out rear-wheel drive, luxury sedans. Lexus stepped in with the first LS400, and they�ve been making great cars ever since.

Shortly after the LS400 debuted, Lexus introduced the ES250. The first ES was a forgettable, re-badged Toyota Camry with some leather thrown in for good measure � and that awful two tone paint scheme only made the ES250 look that much cheaper. The second generation ES still bore a striking resemblance to the Camry of that time, but was a huge improvement over the 250. Today the new ES300 still shares much with the Camry, but along with a more unique exterior, there is true luxury to be found. It seems that early ES cars were simply fancier Toyotas, today it seems as if the Camry is de-contented version of the Lexus car � in short the ES is no longer just a Camry with �classy� paint and extra leather.

On thing Lexus has been able to provide over the years is value. While Lexus automobiles are not inexpensive, they often cost thousands less than a similar vehicle from a rival brand. Starting at just $32,000, the ES offers lots of luxury at a family sedan price. Like many Toyota products, the base price is quite low, add some options or option packages and the price climbs quickly. As tested, this ES had an MSRP of just over $39,000.

The 2002 ES300 is almost all new. Styling is more bold and dramatic; up front are larger headlights that appear to be stretched back as they become part of the hood and fenders. The front end styling of the new ES is really the only part of the car about which a legitimate complaint could be lodged. While Lexus has succeeded in giving the car a more upscale and distinguished look, the front of the car simply looks too bold and somewhat ungainly. Lexus has also succeeded in giving the ES300 its own distinct appearance � the new ES looks longer and lower than a Camry. The ES300 further distances itself from its Camry cousin with sportier looking alloy wheels and unique tail light treatment.

As with most luxury sedans, the ES� interior offers soft and comfy seats that rival the best living room lounge chair. Rear seats are equally comfortable, and offer a pass-through feature. Rich wood trim abounds and chrome accents lend a classy look to the cabin. The optional Mark Levinson audio system sounds wonderful, but seems slightly lacking when compared to the same name brand system found in the GS and LS sedans. Optional navigation system is simply one of the best in the industry. Besides the stellar audio system, the ES� interior has a look and feel similar to American luxury cars � think of the ES300 as a Japanese Lincoln � and that�s not meant as a put down. Lincolns are fairly luxurious cars, now take the Lincoln recipe and add Japanese ergonomics, quality interior materials and Toyota reliability and you have the ES300.

It�s funny how one�s perspective can change once children are in the mix. My wife and I recently had our first child, and suddenly we are noticing certain features (or lack of features) that we never have even considered just 2 months ago. For example, the ES has what anyone would call a roomy trunk, no argument there. The Mark Levinson audio system is a wonderful sound system, no question about that either - and here comes the �but.� The audio system mounts some components on the underside of the package self in the back � the sub-woofer specifically hangs down making it difficult to get a stroller in and out of the trunk. How many ES owners will have small children? Not many, but how many ES owners might have small grand children? Ah Ha! The bottom line is, if you need to haul a stroller and little kid goodies around in the trunk, skip the Levinson sound system,

The ES rides like a soft, fluffy cloud and is just about as quiet. This is no sports car, but the adjustable suspension actually does offer stiffer, sportier ride and handling when �sport� is selected. Other cars, such as the Lincoln Continental, with adjustable suspension seem to offer the same spongy ride no matter where the selector is set. Moving the switch from �comfort� to �sport� nets noticeable differences in ride on the ES300. With the suspension selector set on �comfort� or even one notch above, the ES offers a soft ride befitting a luxury car. This softness can work against the ES when traveling over huge dips, as the car tends to float or bounce too much. However in everyday driving situations, the ES feels exactly like it should � a smooth luxury car.

Acceleration from the 210 hp, 3.0L V6 is smooth and adequately brisk. The ES is not racy or dramatic; it�s just a good, solid luxury car. The 5-speed automatic transmission shifts almost seamlessly under light or heavy acceleration. In certain situations, passing another car at 40 MPH let�s say, the sophisticated transmission seems easily confused, not knowing exactly which gear to use. Press the accelerator just � further when cruising at 35 or 40 MPH, and the car hesitates, then seems to run through two gears before finally settling on the correct setting. Once the transmission finds its way, the ES moves out smartly and often feels more powerful than it really is. This �hunting� from the automatic transmission is not dangerous - it�s just annoying. 

Comparisons to the Camry are inevitable, and it�s only fair since the ES and Camry do share much of their mechanical underpinnings. However there are few differences worth noting. Firstly, the Lexus has a longer bumper-to- bumper warranty - 4 years / 50,000 miles versus the 3/36 on Toyota products. Secondly, Lexus service is more in keeping with what the owner of a $30-40,000 car would expect. Third, the ES300 has nearly 15 more horsepower than a V6 Camry XLE, and the Camry is not available with such options as adjustable suspension, or Mark Levinson audio system. And lastly, the dealership experience - a Lexus salesperson is not going to resort to �what can I do to get you to buy this car today� or other such tacky sales tactics. Unless you like pushy salespeople, the Lexus dealership experience will be far less agonizing when all is said and done. Plus, as a Lexus customer you can almost always count on a complimentary loaner car when having your car serviced � imagine spending $40,000 or more on a Toyota (Avalon, Land Cruiser, Sequoia) only to find when entering the service lane that you�ll be waiting around for the same damp smelling, coffee stained shuttle van as all the �89 Corolla owners.

Overall, the 2002 Lexus ES300 is much better than average luxury car. While there are some similarities to the Toyota Camry, this year�s ES looks substantially different. While enthusiasts will likely be disappointed with the ES� handling and acceleration, Lexus has them covered with the IS300 and GS line of cars. The ES300 is more similar to an American luxury car than any Japanese product, only the Lexus will probably last longer and have a higher resale value than most American brands. While certainly not an inexpensive car, the Lexus does offer value not typically found on most luxury brands. The ES300 is basically a luxury car for the price of a loaded family sedan.
