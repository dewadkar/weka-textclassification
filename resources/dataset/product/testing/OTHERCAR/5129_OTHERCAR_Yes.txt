                 About 4 months ago I purchased a 1994 Dodge Intrepid ES from a independent dealer and so far it is the best car I have bought.  It has all sorts of bells and whistles, 6 cylinders, and it's a 3.1 engine(I won't settle for less).  It had 80,000 miles on it and I'm on 98,000 now, and I haven't had any problems with it yet (except that the headlight bulb is hard to get).  
     When I get in the driver's seat, I feel like putting on some racing gloves, it has smooth and fast acceleration, it handles so wonderfully, and it is perfect for those who want a fast ride but aren't prepared to shell out a lot of cash for it.         
     I can't think of a single person who wouldn't want to buy this vehicle unless your standards are so high that even the best isn't enough.
     If I could this car would be for racing, but for now it's to get back and forth to work, which show this car's multi-purpose advantage of half sports car, half luxury car.<br><br>
