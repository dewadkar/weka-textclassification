            My husband and I spend countless hours searching for a new car. We considered the Honda Accord, Civic, and Kia Spectra. When we test drove the Cavalier we knew it was the one we wanted and I am very happy with our purchase. 

The Cavalier 2-door coupes are absolutely gorgeous, but the sedan was my choice. It has proven to be the most convenient and accommodating with plenty of room for 5 passengers. My car is Red with beige vinyl/cloth seats. The seats are comfortable and recline completely which is excellent for long trips. There are under seat vents for backseat passengers, backseat shoulder strap seatbelts, and the seat folds down to create more room in the cargo area. 

This car nearly takes flight when you put your foot on the gas! Handling is great! You'll feel totally in control while going around sharp curves or maneuvering. 
The engine runs smoothly, there aren&#146t any jerks, and it idles well. It also doesn&#146t bog down when going uphill. Also, I like that the under-hood fluids are easily accessible and clearly marked. This car is Bi-Fuel and gets really good gas mileage.

The interior is nice and has good lighting. It has an auto-dim dome light. The instrument panel lights are white/tan as opposed to the usual green. This car also includes daytime running lights. The glove box is in dire need of lighting. It&#146s very large and there isn&#146t a light inside. 

This car also includes battery rundown protection, air conditioning, heater, front/side/rear defoggers, tachometer, cruise control, tilt steering, dual front airbags, AM/FM/CD player, great speakers, power steering, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control, leather wrapped transmission/shift knob, visor mirrors for driver/passenger, 5 cup holders, front spoiler, mud guards, floor mats, and plenty of space for personal items! 

**Feel free to ask me any questions!**
