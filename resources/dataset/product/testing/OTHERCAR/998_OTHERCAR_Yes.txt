            Well, I have to say I was surprised when my wife took delivery of her new Matrix XRS.  Everything about this vehicle absolutely surprised me...in a good way:

To start, a this car has loads of cargo room.  There was no trouble packing in two of my friends and three bags of hockey equipment for a road trip...with room to spare.  From the pictures I saw and the brochures I read, I assumed this car was tiny and Honda civic like in size.  WRONG.  It's actualy quite big (well not super sized large...but as big as a rav4, but not as tall).  It looks small from far away, but when you get close or park it beside another vehicle it's actualy bigger than you'd think.

The fit and finish of this vehicle is top-drawer for a vehicle in this price range.  You will be hard pressed to find panel gaps or rattles.  The quality of the materials used is quite good.  The interior fabric for the seats is very nice and appears to be quite durable and snugs you nicely in place.  

The overall interior design is excellent.  Everything is where it should be.  The load of standard features is huge.

Another aspect that surprised me was the get up and go of this tiny-high revving 1.8L 4 cylinder.  The XRS model is quite fast, it provides excellent highway passing ability while at the same time it takes it easy on the gas guage.  My wife's vehicle is also equipped with a smooth shifting 6 speed manual, which is very fun to drive.

Things that surprised me in a bad way:

1.  The 17" wheel/tire package is suited for SUMMER DRIVING ONLY...we were not told this until the car was delivered...and I can tell you first hand that if you have to ever drive this vehicle in the snow...make sure you don't have the 17" tires installed.  We went out and bought some 16" steel rims and snow tires the second day we had the car...and if you live in a snowy climate doing this is a must.  ( you could also purchase some 17" all seasons for the winter)  But I will say the 17" wheels and tires will look sweet this summer.

2.  The lack of low-end grunt in this engine.  You don't really start to feel the power until the tach swings up to about 4500 and then you get the full on VVTL-i scream at 6000rpm...but how often do you do that in the city?  (well I do...but I'm a maniac...regular people wouldn't)

...that's it for the "Bad" stuff...and none of it's really too bad...it's just about adapting for me.
