            As Saturns enter the 21st century their SL models are still competetive although they had no major changes for about a decade now.  An affordable Saturn could be a little more affordable, especially the SL2.  Otherwise Saturns are great commuters and not only commuters but good trip cars, they are reliable and safe, two things I care about the most in the car.  Performance is a different issue, look somewhere else, Honda or something peppy.  Since Saturn has 100 hp on SLs and 124 on SL2's, you can't fly away in it.  For me, Saturn is the best choice.  Comparing to some Ford models this is a marvel.  I like plymer body panels that keep Saturns look new longer.  the showrooms are haggle-free and are friendly to some extend.<br><br>
