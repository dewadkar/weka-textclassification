            This camera is the only way to go. It produces great quality pictures and has a superior life rechargeable battery. I have 3 digital cameras and the sony is by far the superior brand. The greatest advantage is being able to load the pictures directly on to a floppy disc. The other cameras are cheaper, however you must buy extra memory cards and this becomes very expensive. If you go on a trip or want to take alot of pictures, you simply keep filling floppy discs which are far cheaper and easier than filling extra memory cards. Without this ability you are constantly reviewing pictures and deleting the ones you don't like for extra storage space....This in turn eats up battery life at a far greater speed than taking pictures and you are constantly replacing batteries which is another expense!!!!! Go with the sony!!!<br><br>
