            I received the Kodak EasyShare DX4330 as a gift last Christmas from my aunt.  When I opened the gift, I was ecstatic.  I have always had an interest in photography and computer, but this was my first Digital Camera.

With the camera came Kodak EasyShare software that helped me upload pictures to my computer directly from the camera through the use of a USB extension.  Depending on computer speed, the pictures upload pretty quickly and are of good quality.

One of the features that I like most about this camera is its user-friendliness.  There is a knob where you can switch the function of the camera.  Some of the icons that the knob turns to are vague and the user can't understand it.  Well, this is fixed by the fact that the function comes up on the screen.  The features I am talking about are: Video (Use for Video), Auto (Use for General Picture Taking), Sport (Use when Subject is in Motion), Night (Use at Night to Capture both Subject and Background), Landscape (Use for Distant Scenery), and Close Up (Use for Subjects Closer than 28 Inches).  Some of the icons include a flower and mountains, so I wasn't sure what they did exactly, but the caption on the screen clarifies it for you.

The delay on the camera lense and photo-taking isn't the greatest.  There is a slight delay, as there is with every digital camera, though.  I don't consider this a huge problem.  I live with it, at least.

The videos (without an additional memory card) can only store up to a little above a minute of video footage.  This has come in handy up at college where we like to shoot little 1 minute videos of us doing really stupid stuff.  In that aspect, the camera has been a lot of fun.  If the memory was a little higher and we could have squeezed in 2 to 3 minute videos, I think the camera would have been much more useful, but the 1+ minutes was adequate.

Being that it's my first Digital Camera, it seems like the battery dies pretty quickly.  I'm not positive on how to compare this to other cameras because I've never used any others for an extended period.

Other than any of these complaints, I like the camera a lot.  I find it's really easy to use, and it's a great camera to have as your first digital camera.  I'm sure there have been much better quality cameras that have come out since, but if you can snag this one for a low price it's worth it.

-----------------------------
I've decided to update this review because of important information I found out about this camera.  Now, this is not regarding the camera itself, but the EasyShare software that the user installs on the computer.  After installing the software, I noticed a few unnecessary programs on my computer.  I didn't immediately link the Kodak EasyShare with the programs, though.  I still am not 100% positive that Kodak EasyShare is responsible for it, but I have read a lot on the internet about the two being linked.

In other words, Kodak EasyShare allegedly installs the EasyShare software as well as adware/spyware onto your computer.  When I read about this, I was furious.  It changes my whole outlook on the package altogether.  The camera is still a very good camera, but I have a very low tolerance for companies that sell me a product and then allow adware/spyware to be installed on my computer.  If anything, just watch out for it.
