            Our Nissan Quest was added to our family of cars when my mother and stepfather were married.  I must admit, I was a little skeptical at first.  We already had a minivan, I didn't think we needed another.  Soon, though, my eyes were opened.

This vehicle can do anything.  With two benches, it has made many trips with a full load of kids in the back.  Never was there a complaint about room.  Then we took the benches out.  There was room for a lawnmower, a power washer, and a tiller.  We had to take our dogs to the veternarian.  Our dogs aren't small.  We took out one bench and they had more than enough room to roam on the short trip.  On top of all this, the machine drives great.  It is very smooth.  It corners like a car.  And I can't remember the last time it visited the mechanic for anything other than an oil change.  Oh, did I mention it gets pretty nice gas mileage, too.  Gas is pretty expensive nowadays.

Guess what?  The seats are comfortable, also.  I have sat in them on some very long road trips.  Actually, I slept most of the way.  That's just how nice those seats are.  Anyone who is looking for some versatility in a minivan would love to have a Nissan Quest.  It is definitely a jack of all trades.<br><br>
