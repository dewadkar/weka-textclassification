            Well, for starters, we own the car. I figure our experience with the car should count toward something. And, well, with the fact that we don't get personally attached (read, &quot;love connection&quot;) to our cars, we can tell you what we think straight up.

Car-buying background: I always thought Hondas were superior to Toyotas, but sold mine cause it had a higher resale value. We bought a used Toyota Camry '86 and put 230,000-plus miles on it till it had a problem no mechanic could diagnose. Cheap price of Toyota Echo caught our eye, read up on it and other options, test drove the car. And six months later, bought the car.

Rundown on features:
Head room: My husband is 6'7&quot; and I am 5'1&quot; -- a good test of the ranges of comfort, I'd say. He loves the head room and finds the car comfortable. (Only problem, he's so long-legged, his knee will sometimes accidentally press against the radio knob and turn on a station -- big funny factor when it's opera playing!) So, do I feel swallowed up in all the space? Do I sometimes feel like I could lean over my seat and shout an echo into the great abyss? No, nothing like that. In fact, I remember thinking how nice it was to feel there was space in front of me and above me. (I felt a little closed in in the Toyota Camry. Honestly, as the Camry got older and we went on long road trips and it began to rattle, I sometimes felt I was in a little rattling tin can. A very vulnerable feeling at 75 mph.) 
Window cranks: Who ever talks about window cranks anymore? Well, we didn't think the electric windows were worth the money (electric locks, maybe). Besides, if I ever accidentally plunge my car into a lake and I need to escape, my local news station says I'm better off with window cranks (provided I'm not knocked unconscious from the impact). But I digress ... the window cranks are a huge improvement over those in the Toyota Camry. We used to put our maps in the passenger and driver's door pockets (for convenience). Every time I needed to crank down the window (drive-through windows, etc.) I had to be extra careful not to crank down and get a nasty paper cut on my knuckles (ouch!). Now the window crank is spaced just far enough away from the door pocket that this doesn't happen. (Thanks Toyota!)
Okay. I like the cubbies. Great for storing maps (we're huge road travelers).
We also like the split glove compartment -- now we can grab the tire gauge, ink pen, paper pad or registration (hi, officer!) out of the top without having to forage through car manual papers and spare fuses that we now keep in the lower glove compartment. (I do wish you could double-lock it like the Camry -- it's the paranoid in me).
The ash tray: Okay, we don't smoke, but we always used our ash tray to put little bits of trash away. Can't do that so easily. The ash tray open is too close to the drive stick. You can only be in park if you want to open the ash tray easily (this was the same problem with the Camry).
The instrument control panel is great. And I'll tell you why. I'm so short, that in other cars, when I want to look at my instrument panel I have to move my head around cause I can't see some of the panel for the steering wheel (even with the wheel tilted down). This isn't a problem with the Echo panel, and it is no trouble to glance to the right and find what I need. (However, the &quot;Empty&quot; light on the gas gauge isn't as noticeable as the bright orange one on the Camry gauge.) Now, my husband likes the panel tilted away from the passenger cause, well, I can't easily see how fast he's driving.
Radio: (We'd never pay the dealer's mark-up on a CD player/radio, so we opted for the basic radio.) Actually, nice sound -- I wasn't expecting much. And the back speakers are pretty nice too. Looking forward to putting in our own CD player for long-distance trips.
 
From the front seat: Lots of leg room for the short-legged driving or riding. If you're long-legged, great if you're riding, not so if you're driving.
From the back seats: (We host a lot of guests, and I always offer the front seat to somebody, so I know what it's like back there.) Okay on the leg room. Great third cup holder! 


Mirrors: The driver's side mirror: I never do feel I can get a good view of the back left panel of the car. It doesn't seem to tilt in quite enough. Other mirrors adjust and work fine.

Echo's looks: Well, when you're American, it goes without saying that this is the most important criteria (how else can you explain why we pay fifty bucks for a Benneton cotton T-shirt?). Actually, we recently went to Germany and got a good look at the foreign cars and -- well, they look like the Echo. Rounded, high, small -- bubble like. It was like being in the land where Echoes were spawned. It was like looking at the future models of automobiles. By the way, since we moved to California (Echo in tow), we've noticed tons more Echoes. (We've even swapped out the Punch-Buggy-Bug game for Echo-Echo and a light punch in the arm.) So, does anybody laugh hysterically at our car. It happened once -- we were at Lincoln Center in NYC coming out of the parking lot, and folks were lined up waiting for the valets to get their cars, and this one man stopped, stared at the car, then broke out in a hysterical fit of laughter (it was contagious -- he had us laughing!). But by far, we've had more kinder curious people ask us what we think and what kind of car is it and is it that new electric car. The most recent was in San Francisco when a teen-ager said: &quot;Cool car! Do you like it?&quot; Some folks are so interested, we just let them sit inside our car and look around at the massive trunk space (a clown troupe could fit in there!). (And we don't even get commission -- wahhh!)

Parking the Echo: Very easy and can fit in tight spots (this really means something if you live in a city and two other cars have crowded out the only legal spot left). And the raised, sloped front makes it easier for a shortie like me to see that I'm parking the car correctly. My husband can get this little car in and out of the most cramped spots (places I wouldn't even think of trying). 

Gassing up the Echo: 35 mpg ... need I say more when prices are two bucks a gallon?!

So, the upshot of all this is ... give Toyota its propers. It produced a zippy, economical car that is extremely affordable. So, it isn't leather seats and auto-everything. You want that, pay more. What it is is a solid car that will stay out of the mechanic's shop. And that's all most of us need.<br><br>
