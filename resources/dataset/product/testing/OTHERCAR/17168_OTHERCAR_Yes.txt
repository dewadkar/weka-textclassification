             I bought my 1990 Camry Wagon 2 years ago with 250,000 miles on it, yes I had some reservations about buying a car with so many miles on it. But it was quite well equipped and was obviously well cared for, also the guy I bought it from was very honest, he even confided that it did use some oil however did not leak as it had all the oil seals replaced, he had documentation to prove as much, every service it had done he had record of. For $2500 I considered it a good buy, I haven't regretted that decicision in the two years I have owned it. I have already put 50,000 miles on it and it is still going like the energizer bunny!                                                              I will start with the pluses, the car gets 30 MPG average it has a decent factory sound system w/CD player. It is a DX model so it has all the power accesories you would expect of a midsize upgrade trim level car. Although more lighting than merely a front and rear dome light would be nice in a car of this class. As far as room the front seats are reasonably comfortable and roomy,the rear seats are tight but I have seen worse, I would say 4 adults could take a long road trip in it comfortably. Being a wagon cargo space is ample, especially with the rear seats folded. Handling is fair but be careful it the rain, it can get squirely and act unexpectedly, after all it IS a wagon not a sports car. The ride however is very nice, like a small Mercedes!                                                      Like any car there are drawbacks, the engine idles rough however it does accelerate smoothly although it is a bit noisy. The car is a bit short on power doesn't like hills much and the transmission compensates by shifting down often even when cruising at 70 when you hit a small incline. This is typical for a midsize 4 cylinder wagon, I had a Cutlass Cruiser wagon that acted much the same, however the engine was quieter. The transmission is a little rough shifting but I have had worse.                                                        All in all the car is very nice and very reliable, the only thing outside of general maintenance that has come up is an electrical problem, some of the dash lights come on for no appearant reason, this is recent and I hope it is not too expensive to fix. I love Vinnie (that is his name, yes I named my car) and will keep it for years, I am sure eventually I will put more in him than he is worth but I don't think I will find another car I love so much any time soon!
