            I tell you, there is not a single product from Honda/Acura that is not worth of at least some kind of praise.  It's real easy to be a loyalist to this manufacturer, and the Integra Coupe is certainly another reason to add yourself to the fan club.

I will be reviewing the GS-R version, the high-end model with a 5-spd manual transmission and a 1.8L 4-pot developing 170HP and 128 lb-ft of torque.

The first time I had a personal experience in this car was at the dealership.  I was with 2 of my friends, one of them was interested in buying (he eventually did buy one).  Well, it was time for the test drive, and so the salesman (gray/white hair, he was at LEAST 60!) said &quot;ok guy, get in the car, I'll take it out of the lot and drive around first&quot;.  So I'm like &quot;great, I hope we get over 40mph with him in the driver's seat&quot;.  So it's 3 kinda big guys in the car PLUS the salesman driving.  Rear seat wasn't comfy, but not horrendous.  Again I always say people complain too much in the back seat of these coupes.  Heheh, anyway...

So the salesman is doing some small talk, and we're cruising around 30-40 mph around town until we get to an on-ramp to a highway.  As we are in the middle of the ramp, a decently-sharp turn, all of a sudden he goes &quot;you know, I used to live/work in Germany, and over there we have no speed limits at many highways&quot;....PLOMP!  VROOOM!!!  WIIIIIIRRRRR!!!!  Wow!  He downshifted 2 gears, and floored it!  I was extrememly impressed with the acceleration, sound, everything.  Especially with 4 guys in the car being pulled by a mere 128 lb-ft!  That VTEC really really really works, at least in this version (yes VTEC comes in different flavors, and I believe the GS-R, Honda Prelude, and NSX are the only cars with the type-3 VTEC).  

Handling was more than enough for most folks, and given the car's light weight, braking felt very confidence-inspring under my left foot when I drove.  Wow, what a sweet shifter/clutch combo!  Honda sure knows how to deliver in that category.  Very clear and legible gauges, and quite a unique curve for the center console.  Not bad at all.

Of course, if you don't get the car with leather, upgraded stereo, etc., it's kinda bland from the inside, but that's not the reason for getting an Integra.  For the money you pay, you get one hell of a &quot;pocket rocket&quot;.  The aftermarket potential is enormous too, albeit being normally-aspirated.  Companies like Jackson racing and other have made exclusive supercharger kits of this car.  They are always seen at West Coast racing events, amongst all the other imports.  The Integra is certainly one of the most famous.

However, I wonder if I would ever buy one over the new Honda Prelude.  I mean for just a coupla thousand more I would get a better package in my opinion.  I guess the exterior design of the Integra never won me over, while the new Prelude (not any faster becuz of greater weight, and the clutch/shifter are about on par with each other in each car) carries a new shape that certainly won over me eventually.  But then again, perhaps 2-3 thousand is a LOT of money for the majority of GS-R buyers.  There are thing like this being a hathback with a much bigger turnk than the Prelude coupe, certainly, but still.  And yet again, heck you can get a Nissan Maxima SE 5-spd with the 222HP V6 these days for around $24k...

If so (every dollar makes a difference), that is fine.  But I must say, from a driver's perspective, it's enough to give this car a 5/5 but I cannot, as the competition is plentiful and the car doesn't offer as many amneties as other do, regardless of how reliable it is (very).  This is the year 2000, and we consumers demand a heck of a lot of pampering these days (apparently) and even for the most avid drivers out there, I can see if some are put off by one or two or three things about the Integra.  But it certainly won't be from the perceived performance and handling offerings this car, well, offers.<br><br>
