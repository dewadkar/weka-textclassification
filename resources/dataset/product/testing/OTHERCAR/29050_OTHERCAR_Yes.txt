            As owner of a '92 LSi, and now a '97 LSi, I am still impressed with car.  Although the design was introduced some ten years ago (1991), it's level of sophistication in engineering advances, styling, build quality, comfort, and amenities allow it to compare most favourably with current production vehicles.

While other cars in it's class provided looks and performance, the SVX went one better with sumptous comfortable accomodations for four, all wheel drive, and comparable performance and economy from a very smooth six cylinder powerplant.

Being a limited production automobile to start with, being in service for up to nearing ten years for the initial 91/92 models, and a vehicle that provides a high amount of "enjoyment", it appears that they are becoming collector vehicles by those affectionadoes who appreciate the finer engineering and styling of the unit.  However, thankfully, it is not a car for everyone.  Good thing, there are'nt enough to go around.

The SVX followed the innovative XT and XT-6 models.  What will follow the SVX. Having confidence in the Subaru team, I'm sure they must have something on the "drawing boards".  If not, I would encourage them to do so
