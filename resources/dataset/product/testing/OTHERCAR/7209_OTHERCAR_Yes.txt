            After sharing 6 years of graduate school and 2 years in a post-doc with my trusty '91 Ford Escort, my husband and I decided that I had earned a spiffier new companion.  It was extremely easy for me to pick out the Mercury Cougar for my next car.  It had the looks, the features, the sportiness, an excellent price tag and shared about 70% of its parts with the reliable Mercury Mystique/Ford Contour car lines.  All in all, an excellent package.  I poured over the brochure, picked out exactly what I wanted (which turned out to be everything but the automatic transmission and the CD-changer) and ordered my Dark Tourmaline, V6 manual transmission sports coupe.

And then I waited.  It took 8 weeks for the car to arrive at my dealership, and that gave me plenty of time to build up a lot of anticipation about my car.  When they drove her around to the front of the dealership, it was love at first site.  And I haven't changed my opinion of this car at all since I took it home.

To start out with, as a 5' 6&quot; woman, I found the seats to be well proportioned for me and extremely comfortable.  Not too long after getting the car, my husband and I took a lengthy road trip. Twenty-five hundred miles later, neither of us had anything bad to say about our comfort level.  Not only that, but the car easily hauled all of our camping gear in its huge hatch.  The back seat is somewhat smaller, and I am not sure I would want to be back there for an extended length of time, but on all occasions that I have carried rear-seat passengers, I have had no complaints.  In fact, people are usually surprised and feel like there was more room than they expected there would be.

Getting into a comfortable driving position is relatively easy.  The 6-way drivers seat moves well, and the steering wheel can be positioned higher or lower.  At times I've thought it would be nice if it telescoped a little, but I haven't had any problems without that feature.  I find the interior controls very easy to manipulate from the driver's seat, especially the climate controls, which are large, easy to read dials.  With the manual transmission, I never found I had a problem getting to the buttons on the stereo console, and the buttons are big enough to manipulate easily.  As far as cabin comfort is concerned, the car heats up and cools down quickly, and I find it easy to get the car to a comfortable temperature.  Another nice creature comfort of the car is the heated side-view mirrors.  They turn on whenever you run the rear defroster.

But the real reason I love my car is the way she drives.  The steering wheel gives you a lot of responsive road feel, and I don't feel like there is either excessive under or over-steer.  The car is strong off the mark, and when you hit ~3500-4500 rpm the V6 makes some particularly lovely noises and takes off like a shot.  This cat loves to run.  And I can't recommend a manual transmission on this car enough.  Not only does it add to the fun feeling of really driving your car, but it makes the acceleration quite a bit quicker.

Living in Chicago, my only concern about this car was how it was going to handle in the winter.  Although the BF Goodrich Comp T/As that came with the car are considered all-season sport tires, winter experiences in my husband's sport coupe taught me to be wary of wider tires in the snow. I got the car equipped with both ABS and traction control, and I would recommend both of these features to anyone who has winter weather to contend with.  The Cougar feels solid even in very slippery conditions, and the traction control makes the car even more surefooted.  And no matter what the weather, the braking in this car is excellent.  I've had at least one close call where I know the brakes on the car made the difference between a close call and an accident.

In the 6 months I've had the car, I've had only minimal maintenance issues.  When I got the car, the steering wheel didn't true up as well as I would have liked, but that was taken care of on the first oil change, and I've had no problem since.  

This car has incredible styling, is a blast to drive, and has a lot of practical function too.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for an affordable, sporty ride, and a taste for its unique looks.  <br><br>
