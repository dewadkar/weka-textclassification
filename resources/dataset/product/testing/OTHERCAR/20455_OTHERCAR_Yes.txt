            While I am a fan of the BTTF trilogy my passion for the DeLorean came about well before the movie.  The sleek design, predator-like gullwing doors and the promise of no corrsion to the stainless body all made for a car that struck an immediate chord.  

The DeLorean is noticed everywhere it goes.  I love the fact that it turns so many heads. I love the engineering on the car, the doors (of course!) and yes, I like the visibility that BTTF has brought it.  The only thing I really hate are cocaine jokes and other degrading things said about John DeLorean. While I am on the fence about all details of the demise of DMC, I honor the man for what he accomplished and do not wish to dwell on the tawdry grocery store ragsheet-like stories that many people try to bring up in conversation.  JZD was aquitted on all charges....end of story.

This car sticks to the road like glue, handles like a dream. The PRV V-6 is a tad underpowered compared to todays sport cars BUT the overall driving experience is still one that gets to me even after all these year of owning one.  My car has been totally reliable with only normal maintenance.  I feel the power the DeLorean produces is quite adequate for my needs and I have never been in a situation where I wished the car had more.  Parts are more available than most 20 year old cars that are no longer in production.  Defective components have been identified LONG ago and our DeLorean vendors now offer upgraded technology on most faulty parts.  The Delorean automobile has a HUGE loyal following that give the owner a remarkable database to search through for help.   

Don't buy a DeLorean if you have no money to maintain it.  Other than that I think that a DeLorean is a great car for anyone with a passion for the unique and those that don't mind getting a lot of attention. My wife will not drive my car because of the attention it generates so, if you are a wallflower than this is not the car for you. My DeLorean was, at one time, my ONLY car, my daily driver so I feel that it is that reliable.<br><br>
