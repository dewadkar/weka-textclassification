            Engine: 2.0, 5 speed Manual transmission, Sun Roof, 6 CD player, Air bags (front and side), ABS, power windows, Price: 17,500

Purchased to update to newest/newer technology &#150 i.e. ABS, R134a Freon, air bags.  All of our &#145then&#146 vehicles did not have any of these features.

*Maybe this 2003 data will assist with the purchase of a 2004
*Due to poor service by the dealership &#150 I will never buy another Mazda.
*Purchased in California in July 2003, Used the Mazda.com site to find the car (by VIN) we wished. Had to travel to Oakland to secure it as the nearest dealerships didn&#146t wish to assist.
*Odometer currently about 18,000
*EPA (fuel economy) is  25/30 &#150 I always get 28/30. If I run the car over 72mph, fuel economy always drops to 25, maybe 26. 
*Fuel tank capacity  &#150 14.5 gals
*Acceleration &#150 good
*Handling &#150 good
*Tires &#150 P195/50/16 &#150 somewhat special, not avail at places like Walmart, Costco &#150 cost to replace??
*ABS &#150 works great, have had to use it in several tight spots, ABS probably saved the day
*Odometers  - Digital
*Trip odometer &#150 2 available, both only go to 1000miles
*Fuel filter in tank
*Transmission is a piece of cake to service.  Both fill/drain plus on bottom of trans.
*Timing belt replacement &#150 105K vice the normal/usual 60K
*Rear window defroster &#150 does &#145not&#146 shut off automatically, i.e. must be done manually
*Rear window washer draws fluid from front (under the hood) reservoir
*Rear window wiper &#150 14", not available at common stores like Walmart, Target. Must go to a parts house or the dealer
*Keys &#150 not a &#145computer&#146 key
*Oil filter &#150 especially small, a bit expensive
*Engine oil capacity &#150 3-3/4 quarts (not much)
*Dealer pre-inspection prior to sale &#150 not followed &#150 i.e. all 4 tires incorrect pressure, lug nut improper torque
*Interior noise &#150 OK at best
*Interior fan for defroster/heater etc &#150 quiet on 1st position, on positions 2, 3, and 4, sounds like a freight train - extremely noisy. It&#146s as if the dash duct work is not connected.
*Parts availability -- to date, mostly dealer 
*Warranty Problems first 6 months of ownership &#150 (1) Drivers window noisy - was told by dealership that factory had forgotten to lube, (2) Car shut down completely while driving at about 76mph on the interstate for about 15 seconds  &#150 vehicle turned back on by itself &#150 this was certainly exciting being the lead vehicle in darkness and almost getting run over with 'no' shoulder to pull over to &#150 dealer said no problems found - unable to do anything until problem resurfaces again &#150 hasn&#146t happened again, (3) Cruise control activated by itself - dealer stated that was impossible -- hasn't happened again, (4) Annoying noise, mostly constantly there, is somewhere in front passenger door panel &#150 dealer is unable to repair after 3 attempts &#150 dealer acknowledge that it does exists &#150 dealer now refuses to repair it, said I should go elsewhere, (5) Annoying noise behind the instrument cluster &#150 dealer does acknowledge that it does exist &#150 dealer unable to repair/correct after 3 attempts &#150 dealer now refuses to repair it, said I should go elsewhere.
*Warranty/Problem resolution &#150 Called Mazda&#146s corporate office (Irvine California, 800 telephone number), short version is too bad &#150 your loss, our gain &#150 i.e. Each dealership is an independent and is not required to work on a vehicle unless they wish. Corporate office suggested that I try the next closest dealership even though it&#146s 30 minutes farther.  Reader&#146s Digest version is there &#145Isn&#146t a warranty&#146 unless they wish it to be so. What&#146s left &#150 Litigation?? Sound hard to believe but after writing this, I will pursue other avenues in attempts to have Mazda honor the warranty.
*Good luck.
