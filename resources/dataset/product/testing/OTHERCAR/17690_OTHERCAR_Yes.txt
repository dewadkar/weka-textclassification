            I bought my Saturn last year because I was looking for a dependable vehicle to take me the long distance to college and work and back home.  It was also necessary to find something on the inexpensive side, seeing as I was just a poor student.  I had been terrified that finding something for less money would mean a used car with no warranty, but spending some time at the local Saturn dealer changed my mind.

The Saturn staff lived up to it's reputation for being easy going and friendly, and answered all of my questions and more.  The company offers a service plan that includes oil changes and general maintenance, and even allows you to stop by the dealer when ever you wish just to have them run your car through the car wash.

The SL2 that I ended up with is economical and comfortable.  It's safety features are unbeatable and kept me perfectly safe when I was struck by a tall Jeep last winter.  The repair costs to replace the dented panels were minimum, and service from the dealer was prompt.

The only deterring factor is the hard ride produced by the stiff suspension.  I don't mind it, being used to driving a little Suzuki Sidekick, but my passengers tend to comment on it.

I think this is a perfect car for students and singles and young couples.  Those looking for a luxury vehicle may be warded off by the suspension.<br><br>
