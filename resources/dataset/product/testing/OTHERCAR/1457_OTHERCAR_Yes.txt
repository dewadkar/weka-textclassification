            I bought this SC2 to replace my totaled (R.I.P.) SC that I owned from 1992-1999. The reason I chose a 96 SC2 instead of a new one is I liked body style and the 96 SC2 and 92 SC are basically identical. Saturn has an excellent certified pre-owned program and I found my SC2 on the Saturn web site, then went to my retailer (which happened to be the same one where I got my old 92 SC new) to test drive and buy it. I love this &quot;new&quot; one for the same reasons as my old one. This SC2 is actually nicer since Saturn updated the interior and the front fascia and rear decklid spoiler styling. And it's notably quieter than my old one. The plastic body continues to impress along with the easy maintenance items. Saturn did a complete inspection and replaced everything needed to make this used Saturn like new. The retailer experience was the same as before--excellent. Somehow the engine is quieter and smoother yet uses less fuel and the car is slighter quicker. Handling is great and the seats have been firmed up some to make them more comfy for long trips. I took it to Homecoming 1999 and it felt good. Anyone looking for a sport compact car should look at the SC2 coupe that comes with the twincam engine and 5 speed manual trans. Of course if you need real back seats for adults, then the SL2 sedan or SW2 wagon would be a better choice. I've been a Saturn owner since 1992 and they continue to impress me. I'm somewhat spoiled now with the picnics and car washes and t-shirt. Oh and the car is really cool too. Did I mention the dent resistant and rust proof plastic body? <br><br>
