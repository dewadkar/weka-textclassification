            I bought this Impreza new, as I was living in the Northern CA mountains and I needed something I could get around with in the snow.  It has been a goer, by that I mean I now have over 150,000 miles, with very little maintenance.  We have replaced spark plugs, oil, and belts when suggested.  Other than that, there has been no extra maintenance.  We still have not replaced brakes, clutch, or anything but tires.  Plus, after moving to the Oregon Coast, I thought we'd have problems with salt air.  Guess what, it is holding up great!  It has nice wide seats, that fit my widening posterior, and my husband who is 6'3&quot;, can sit comfortably in it.  My brother-in-law who is 6'5&quot; was also comfortable.  On a recent 1500 mile trip to San Diego, we averaged 30 miles to the gallon.  I love my Subaru!!!!<br><br>
