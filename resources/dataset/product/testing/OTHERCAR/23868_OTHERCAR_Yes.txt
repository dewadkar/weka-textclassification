            I bought this car used from my father (that's why the purchase price is so low) 2 years ago who in turn had purchased it used from a dealership. I owned a 1986 Toyota Camry before this which was good but definitely had more problems throughout it's life than this car.

The best (and most important) thing about this car is that it's reliable. When it was my Dad's we drove out to California and back (from NY) in it and he also used it to travel for work, which was quite a bit. When I bought it, I used it do drive home from college about once month (about 600 miles round trip). When I got my first job, which was as a consultant, I used it to drive all over the city to clients. It has also made the trip from NC to NY and back a couple of times. The point is, this car was driven in all types of conditions (highway, city, snow, rain) including being owned by a poor college student who couldn't always get the maintenance done on time with no major problems. At this point the car has over 160000 miles on it and shows no signs of stopping.

The next best thing about this car is the sun roof. It doesn't get much better than driving around on a warm spring/summer day with the sunroof open and the radio on...at least not on my budget. It also is pretty comfortable considering that it's a coupe and getting older.

The biggest problem I have with the car is with the heating/AC controls. The dials don't seem to be designed well and usually end up cracking about every 6 months. Fortunately, It's only about $5 at the dealer to replace them. 

The other problem I have is with the dealers themselves. When my fiance and I were looking to replace his Ford Escort we really wanted another Honda. Most car dealerships seem to have evolved over the years (or at least hide it better) so they don't use such pushy sales tactics and make some attempt at a reasonable offer. Not Honda. We finally couldn't take it anymore and ended up buying a Camry. On the other hand the service department at most dealerships are pretty good. It will cost a little more than Jiffy Lube but at least they know what they're doing.

Overall this is a great car especially if your the kind of person who keeps a car until it's dead and you have the patience to argue with the dealer. Even with the hassles we had with the dealer last time I think when this one finally goes my next car will be another Accord.
