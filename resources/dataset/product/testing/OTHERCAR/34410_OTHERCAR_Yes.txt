            ok....this really isn't my vehicle...it's my dad's, but i drive it ALL the time so i know a few things about it. First of all...when you get all the options...it's a sweet ride. Leather makes it better and how can you have a car without a CD player and sunroof?? Anyways...a few suggestions.. first....if you get this car, i reccomend getting a five speed. The Tiburon is a nice drive, but it drives like it should be a five speed....the car is made for speed people. Plus...if you have ever driven it...you know that it doesn't shift gears fast enough and has poor pick-up. It would definately be alot better if it was manual. Ok.... now for the good part....the new ones have Porche Technology!! WooHoo!! That just means it handles a lot better. A friend of mine told me to have it lowered so it handles better....he has obviously not driven one. They handle great!! I would definately reccomend this car to anyone who feels the need for speed....but grandma and grandpa should stick to something a little easier. It's definately a car made for the younger crowd. <br><br>
