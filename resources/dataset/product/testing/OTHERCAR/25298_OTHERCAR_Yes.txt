            This is the Camera for Macro's or Close Us!  The Nikon Coolpix 700 or the rest of the Coolpix family sore above the rest of the digital cameras for their macro or close up capabilities.  Shooting mere inches away from your subject, you can capture fine details in a frame filled with any object.  This camera is especially easy to you and great for posting pictures of artwork, hobbies, or any item that you want someone to get a good look at.  It is so crucial for internet marketing to display a good picture of your item in order to sell it.  The Coolpix 700 or above does such a good job, that you will feel greatly satisfied. 

The lens captures the detail, depth and color of your object accurately, especially when you learn how to use some of the very easy manual features.  The white balance features let you choose a specific target area of your object, move in, adequately light your subject, get rid of dark areas, and shoot the subject in full clarity.  Clarity and color are impressive.  Your able to change the aperture in manual mode and choose the type of light you are shooting in for even more accurate results.  

When compared with the top of the line Olympus camera in the same category, the macro clarity is better.  I would trade in my SLR for good if I could use the digital camera to produce slides of my work, but for now I have both.  

A drawback of this camera and other digital cameras is that they use batteries fast.  I use the AC adapter when shooting in the studio, but if I wanted to be mobile the batteries are waisted in less than an hour.  Digital equipment is can not compare with SLR cameras in this area.  Rechargeable will go fast also. and they are expensive.  Additional equipment raises the base price of any camera: compact flash memory cards, (you will need a bigger card than Nikon supplies you with in the package) and the AC adapter.  You can still buy even more accessories and they would all be very helpful, but that can add $100-$500 to the list price!!!

All in all Nikon has made a great digital camera, I would buy another in a (compact) flash!
