            This digital camera is a great little piece of electronic genius. I know I've taken over three thousand photos with it, nearly all came out with superb quality.
<br>
<b>Diving Photography :</b>
I have taken this camera on more dive trips than I can remember, and I&#146ve never thought of getting another type. It&#146s got everything I need to get crystal clear pictures that I print of in A4 size still crystal clear. All I do is put it on the right settings put it in the specially built A40 Canon Underwater Housing unit and take it down with me. I have made many videos underwater and I love these functions, but best of all the quality of the photos are excellent. The case is recommended to dive to 30 metres, but I have taken it over that and it held together very well. 
<br>
<b>Negative aspects of this camera :</b>
When using it for diving, the camera does not have the hugest amount of accessories as some others do. The camera also doesn&#146t make an amateur (or poor) photographer take excellent photos, as canon tries to convince. Therefore you need to know something about cameras and getting good photos, or at least willing to learn otherwise this will be a very bad investment and a cheaper camera should have been bought. 
<br>
One of the most noticeable things when using the camera is the shutter lag, this is especially obvious when using underwater. I have over 150 photos which could have been much better, when you go to take a photo of a fish press down the button and when you look at the photo there&#146s only halve of it in the picture it gets very annoying. Now I am used to it and it doesn&#146t really annoy me I just try to predict in those situations.
<br>
<b>Positive aspects of this camera :</b>
This camera has a huge amount of positive features. One of the best for me is the amount of accessories for this camera as in all Canons (except when it comes underwater add ons). Many of the accessories are purpose built, this really tempts me when buying a camera, because if there&#146s something you need you know it will work exactly the way you want it to. 
<br>
Another positive aspect is the flash. Before I could afford any fancy strobes or good flashes I had to use the inbuilt one. I was very surprised on how the photos turned out so surprised that even now I sometimes don&#146t bother about strobes because the photos are that good. I also love how compact and light it is which is handy for every application especially diving, because it can be put anywhere.
<p>
<b>This is a great camera but remember before purchasing it compare it to others in your price bracket, but never choose unheard-of  brands, these are inexpensive but very bad cameras and not just for diving, for everything.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>P.S I got my A40 and the housing unit for just under $450</b>
