            We bought the Mavica MVC-FD95 as a college graduation gift for my husband.  We had used other brands of digital cameras, and frankly, we hated the cable hook-ups and messing around with memory cards.  We knew that Sony had the floppy drive, and my husband, having used another version of the Mavica decided this was the one he wanted.  We were going to get the FD91 until we got word of the FD95 being on the market.  

We've owned the camera for a month now, and I can't gush about it enough. The quality of the pictures are fabulous.  I've taken a couple of artsy-type pictures of flowers and sunsets which are near-professional looking (if I do say so myself) thanks to the steady shot.  I love taking pictures of sunsets, but with my regular camera, I'm never sure how they are going to turn out.  The pictures are always hit and miss.  The other day, however, we had the Mavica with us when we saw this incredible golden sunset of a thunderstorm.  I stopped to take some pictures.  A couple didn't turn out nicely, so I deleted them on the spot.  But the ones I took -- WOW!  I also took a picture where I needed to use the zoom lens.  The focus of my shot was probably a mile away, but I was able to zoom in until it looked like it was inches away.  

The floppy disk drive was a major reason for buying the camera and it remains a positive for us.  We did buy the memory card (which slips into a special disk to fit into both the camera and the computer disk drive).  We haven't used it yet; I think we'll use it when we use the camera as a video recorder.  One experiment we tried with the camera, too, was hooking it up to our VCR, and we were able to tape directly onto a VHS tape.  (Never you mind why we're interested in that option!!!)  Oh, and yes, we can also view our still pictures on the television.  How cool is that?  A new way to bore our friends and relatives with high-tech slide shows.  On the other hand, a nifty feature of the camera is the disk copy.  Pop in one disk, hit the copy command, pop in the fresh disk, and voila.  Since we always carry a ton of disks with us when we have the camera, we've been able to give copies to grandparents.

There are a whole bunch of gadgets on the camera we haven't tried yet -- like changing the picture to black and white, sepia-tone, negative effect, or illustrated -- but like I said, we've only had it a month.  It came with a two-hour battery.  We also bought a four-hour one.  We've only used the four-hour so far, on one charge, and we've taken several hundred pictures so far.  

The digital isn't going to take the place of our regular camera and keeping regular prints around the house.  But for me, a budding photographer, it has been a godsend.  I'm learning how to use my photographer's eye without expensive film developing and messed up pictures.  It wasn't a cheap camera, either, but well-worth the expense, especially seeing how much we've been using it -- and will continue to use it.<br><br>
