            recently i bought a used volvo. it was the biggest mistake of my life. i will never buy a nother volvo. 
the first problem was the ac fluid. the fluid runs out every two or three weeks. that is 100 times faster than all my other cars.
the second problem was a good two dollars in change inside the ac vent. that was an expensive fix.
the third problem is the front wheel drive. this car spins out on every turn in the rain or snow.
the fourth problem and final problem with this car is the gasoline leaks all over the engine; now i either can replace the car or the engine.

DO NOT GET A VOLVO!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
