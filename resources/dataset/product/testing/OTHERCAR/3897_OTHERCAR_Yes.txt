My mother purchased a 94' Voyager minivan.  For six plus years now it has served us very well.  Now with over a hundred thousand miles on the van we have decided that it is time for us to purchasse another van.  However Plymouth is no longer a truely American owned company, this cuases an issue.
Although I believe in fair trade and equal opportunity for car manufacturers I am tired of hearing people say that American companies do not make good reliable vehicles and that this is some sort of excuse to run out and support someone elses' company.
All day long you can hear people complain about the degradation of the American economy yet in some of our largest financed purchases ,often financed also by foriegn companies, we turn to some other country to support us.
I believe it is a sad day when we can look no further than than our own own ego when it comes to the flashy fuel efficient cars we wish to drive.  For a fact that is indisputable American manufacturers have designed some of the worlds finest automobiles and they would have continued to if people would place a little faith in US manufacturers they would have the money enough for R&amp;D and not need to take one of the Big Four and turn it into a foriegn owned company posing as an American owned company.  Do not be fooled by the media that you exposed to.  Seek the truth and you will find that we are a long ways off from the days of true American pride following WWII.  It appears,at least to this individual, that unless something is done to reclaim or independence then we will in at least an economical standpoint be the lap dogs to who ever we purchase more from in the world.

When you are making a decision to purchase vehicles in the future, remember what real help or harm you can cuase by which dealer you end up talking to.<br><br>
