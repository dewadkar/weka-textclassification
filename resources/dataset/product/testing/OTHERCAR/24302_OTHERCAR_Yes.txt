            As I was searching for a car, I came across a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and test drove it.  After that experience, I had SUV fever.  I went to practically every dealership within 30 miles of my home looking at only SUVs.  Nothing could compare to the Jeep I test drove.

There are many features in the Grand Cherokee Laredo. The 1995 model is the first year that they made them fully loaded, power everything, digital compass, temperature.  My Jeep has the option to put it into 4WD when I need to, which saves on gas mileage.  I have driven cross country many times and the drive was very comfortable.  It is perfect for camping trips or weekend getaways.  I have driven in inclement weather and found it very easy to handle and control.  It is very roomy compared to other SUVs that I looked at. 

I recommend this to anyone who is looking to purchase an SUV or minivan.  My wife and I absolutely love it and there is plenty of room for the kids.
