            I bought my camera at Beachcamera.com, which had a price that was $100 cheaper than anywhere else on the web (I found them at pricewatch.com), but don't order from them unless you have a couple of weeks to wait for your order, even if you do want it shipped 2-Day.

Anyway, I really love my Olympus D-460Z.  I have had it for three or four months now.  Up til that time, I only used point-and-shoot 35mm cameras, and I fancied myself an amateur photographer, having taken some good shots and learned to frame things nicely.

My parents were going to give me money for a digital camera when I decided to move across the country after vacation.  I did research and found that the Olympus D-460Z had very few negative reviews, especially here at Epinions.com.

When I bought my camera, I did go out and buy the NiMH batteries and recharger (about $50) and, later, a 35mb SmartMedia card (about $50).  I have not bought the USB SmartMedia card reader.  The serial port connection is a bit slow, but I just set it up to download and go do something else for fifteen minutes.  No problem.  
I have also not bought the AC adapter, figuring the money was better spent on the batteries and recharger.  My father (on my advice and his own research) bought this same camera, and we took them out last weekend when we were in DC.  He was using regular alkaline AA batteries and went through a couple of sets of them while mine only needed recharging.  I think he was convinced that the NiMH batteries and recharger were the way to go.

I have been impressed with the zoom function and the fact that this camera takes low-light pictures even without the flash.  I like this ability quite a lot.

The picture quality is perfect for sending in emails, though I usually chop the size down a bit.  The 8mb SmartMedia card that comes with the camera can hold 36 images in the default camera compression, which is about twice the size you'd want to send in emails.  I like to use the default size.

I hope that you buy an Olympus D-460Z and get as much use out of yours as I do mine!  I have stopped using my 35mm completely!  This is a much cheaper alternative, and I plan to try out services like Ofoto.com in the not-too-distant future!
