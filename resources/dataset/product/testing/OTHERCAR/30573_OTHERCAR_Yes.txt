            So far, this has been a great vehicle. The ride is smooth - we will be going on a long road trip next summer. There is plenty of room, the gas mileage is good but not great but better than most comparable SUVs. The cargo area with the third row seat put away is cavernous and too is too well designed. Unless the cargo is tied down, it shifts all over the place. Consequently, we have the third row most of the time. Center console is big enough to hold a fast food tray. Interior is otherwise spartan, but nothing seems cheap. However, the rear air vent louvers pop off their mounts with the slightest force. This vehicle is wide and in the So Cal land of narrow parking slots, dings are almost a certainty. Wish I didn't have to pay extra for the cargo cover or roof rack cross bars. Only time will tell whether the Pilot was worth the cost differential over a 0% financing Explorer, Envoy, Trailblazer, Montero, etc. or 1.9% on Pathfinder/QX4. Rear cargo door may not clear some garage doors-I had to pad my tilt up garage door.
