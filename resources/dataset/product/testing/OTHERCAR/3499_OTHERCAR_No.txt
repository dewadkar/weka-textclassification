            I've driven the E420 for over 3 years, and I put a set of 18&quot; AMG Aero II monoblocks with Dunlop SP8000 235/18/40ZR tires to bring up the performance. At this setup alone, it transformed the handling completely, where I could make turns with much more confidence at any speed. The braking distance and feel is improved also. I found the 
original wheels and tires being too soft for my taste, although the original set of wheels are VERY comfortable. But please note that the ride suffers a bit with the 18&quot; wheel. The sports package gives you 17&quot; wheel, which may suit most people's needs.

This car has incredible strength in power, sturdy chasis, and a very quiet engine (what MB is well known of). The E420 has an engine with 4 valves per cylinder, making it a 32 valve engine. The new E430 uses a 3 valve per cylinder engine, but are fitted with twin-spark plug. In my opinion, because the E430 engine has a flatter torque curve, it offers more torque available at low RPMs (than the E420), but the E420 runs happier at higher RPMs. Both models run similar in general, but I personally like the 4 valve per cylinder setup more.

But no car's perfect; there are some improvements that I would like to see in the E-class cars. First is to have a heavier steering (like older Mercedes). Second, there are fair amount of road noise coming in to cabin, for some reason; but it is at an acceptable level. The strange thing is that you 'hear' the road noise, but don't 'feel' it, like &quot;Car and Driver&quot; stated in their review.

I've driven the BMW 540i, Lexus GS400, and Jaguar S-Type. They all have their strength. It was an easy decision for me to buy the E420, since I only had the 540i to compare it with. But with the advanced Lexus GS400 available now, it makes the buying decision a bit tougher. At this price range, if you prefer to drive with a car that has a good name and own it for over 10 years, consider the E420; if you're die-hard performance driver, consider the 540i; if you don't want to pay big bills for regular maintenance, but still want to have the luxury, consider the GS400. I'm not a big fan of Jaguar, but the S-Type has really evolved!

But watch out, the Germans, the Japanese are coming strongly, and are really close now....<br><br>
