            This car is great!! It will surely turn heads wherever it goes. I was looking at cars and this one caught my eye, it looked very nice but i wasn't too sure about it until I took it for a test drive. It is extremely fast and includes the exact same engine as the 300m.It handles like a dream and is hard not to speed in. 

I was also blown away by the Infinity 12 speaker setup which sounds perfect with any kind of music from classical to hip hop. 

For those hot summer days it has ice cold air conditioning and in the bitter cold winter it has heated seats as well as a wonderful heater. The back seat is very roomy and can fit 3 adults comfortably. It also has a HUGE trunk where you can fit nearly anything. The seats are very comfortable and could pass as couches. 

If you are looking at this car but are not sure about it, take it for a test drive and you will definitly not be disappointed. 

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a wonderful car or anyone who wants a ton of speed. It is however not a very cheap car. But it is the best car I've ever owned. <br><br>
