            I bought my '96 Saturn SC1 almost three years ago with 24,000 miles on it.  First off, let me just say that one of the key factors that led me to buy it was the fact that it is so cheap to insure.  Due to the lack of metal used on the fenders (which in no way affects the structural integrity of the vehicle), Saturns are remarkably cheap to repair when you get into an accident.  Thus, as a result, insurance rates have plummeted on this car.

Now, as far as reliability is concerned, there is no question about it, this car is trusty.  I've put over 40,000 miles on this car since I bought it, and the only repair I've had to make was a routine spark plug change, which every car would have needed within the first 60,000 miles anyhow.  As long as you take care of this car with proper fluid changes, alignment, tire rotation, etc., this car will take care of you.  In addition to being reliable, it gets phenomenal fuel efficiency.  With a 10 gallon tank, I can get almost 275 miles in the city, and well over 300 on the highway.

Further, I was really impressed with its quickness.  Most cars in its price range are remarkably slow.  I have a manual transmission, and its second and third gears accelerate smoothly and rapidly.  Down-shifting is a true pleasure in this car.

Don't miss out on this car because there really isn't anything else in its price range that is as cheap to keep running and as pleasurable to drive.<br><br>
