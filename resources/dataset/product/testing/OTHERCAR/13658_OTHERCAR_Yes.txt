            I am a real estate appraiser in a large city, I needed something cheap. I wanted a mini SUV for the heavy winter months but also good for mountain and desert camping in the summer. I was sold on the Sportage EX because of looks and price. Now alot of people complain about the lack of "get up at GO power" that the sportage has and this is very true, however you get used to it! For using my Kia everyday in the city I have never had trouble getting into traffic on the freeway or anywhere else. If you came from a sports car like I did to a slow mini SUV like the sportage it is a culture shock. But the sportage is what it is and although slow to speed up, it is very functional overall. 

Repairs: My sportage was recalled for some wiring and for new HUBS that do not allow water in. This was simple fix by the dealer and I was on my way. All of my family members have bought new cars in the past couple of years and everybody has had a few recalls and few minimal repair problems, this seems to be commonplace for new cars these days.

Also, my back tire swing gate got jammed (permentalty), when the latch got stuck behind the locking mechanism. My warranty was expired and I had to fix it myself ($130 in parts).

Alot of people have complained about the brakes. I too have had to replace my brakes twice in 70K miles. I suggest going somewhere and getting lifetime brakes put on. These replacement of the brakes however may be my fault because of having to really slam on the brakes many many times due to deer, bad drivers etc. therefore my brakes can be abused with all my driving.

The repairs for the Kia sportage have been very few in number and better than any other car I have owned to date. My kia sportage is used and abused in constant driving and working out of my car most of the day. The 4x4 works great and the car is perfect for what I need. I personally believe that it is the best REAL 4X4 in it's class and you get alot of car for the money.
