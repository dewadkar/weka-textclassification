            I have been the proud owner of my 1997 Volkswagen Jetta GL for six months. This is the sweetest ride I have ever experienced. The Jetta is attractive, roomy, comfortable, and so much more fun than anything else I have ever driven. My white beauty has the base 2.0 4-cylinder with the five speed. While not quite as snappy as a VR6 or TDI, the 2.0 gives plenty of power. The clutch is smooth and quick shifts are easy. Maintenance is relatively simple (for the do-it-yourself mechanic). The seats are about as comfortable as your favorite lounge chair. The trunk is huge, and without stretching the car to the size of a Lincoln. The folding rear seat also comes in handy. The VW Premium Audio system sounds like something that has a few hundred dollars in upgrades added. I have very few complaints with my Jetta, and they are minor. The front beverage holders barely accommodate a 12-ounce Coke can. As for usual fast food drink containers, forget it. The spare tire well is not deep enough to fully accommodate a full-size spare. It can be done without robbing too much trunk space, but the cover panel will stick up a little. The only actual problem I've had was the central locking switch on the dash. It fell apart. The switch was replaced by my VW dealer at a relatively low cost. This is my second Jetta, having replaced my trusty 1990. I must say, there will be no more non-Volkswagen cars for me. The Jetta has made me a "Volkshead" for life.
