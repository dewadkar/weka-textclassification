            I purchased this camera in November of 1999, trying to find a better camera. This camera is one of the best in it's class.You can take pictures of different sizes and also take a short film. It is the best thing.

One of the things that I like about this camera is that you can see the picture that you are taking and you can decide weather or not you want to keep the picture. You can also put the disc in your computer and fix the red eye or whatever you want to fix on the picture.

I went on a cruise in December and I took this camera along, and boy was I glad I did. I got to take pictures of the special times that I had and save them on a disc. You never have to worry about losing the pictures with the disc. 

Anyone who loves to use cameras would love this camera. It is a very updated camera, but easy to use. The average person that knows nothing about cameras can easily use this one. The product is the best!
