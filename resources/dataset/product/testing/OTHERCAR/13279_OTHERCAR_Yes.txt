            If you are looking for one of the most reliable automobiles on the market, I highly recommend the Honda Accord.  If you keep the tank full of gas, change the oil every couple of thousand miles, and if you want to keep your Accord, it should give you at least ten years of hassle free driving.

I had a 88 Accord that I drove for ten years with little or no repairs.  The buyer who purchased it continues to call me every couple of months letting me know how my old Nellie is doing.  I also drive a 93 and 99 Accord.  You can expect to replace the battery like clockwork to the day every 36 months.  The hoses last a lifetime, and the air is always ice cold.

If you are looking for a truly reliable car to get to work with every day, the Honda Accord will not leave you stranded on the road, or give you cause to call into work with a car breakdown story!  Put your pedal to the metal and get yourself a Honda Accord.<br><br>
