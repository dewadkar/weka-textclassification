            What's not to love about this digital camera?  It is simple to use and takes great pictures.  In fact, we opened our's up (it was a present) on Christmas eve and were clicking away by early the next morning.  Before Christmas day was through, our families up and down the coast were able to see the boys in all their present-filled glory via our emailed photos.

This camera is light-weight and easy to use.  It stores 20 or more photos at a time depending on the settings you choose and the battery holds its charges for hours.  It works with standard disks and it can format them if they are not already.  This model also has cool features like black and white or sepia and I love the fact that you can choose to delete those pictures in which your hair isn't perfect or the kids' aren't smiling.  The pictures are also easy to transfer onto your computer and to email to family and friends.  The files are jpg so they download quickly allowing you to email six or more pictures without the long wait that gif or bitmap photos require.  My father runs his entire business on ebay and this is the only camera he uses to photograph his antiques.

This camera almost makes me want to throw my non-digital one away, but I am leary about how the photo quality of the printed images will hold up over the years.  Perhaps, I simply need to do a little more research in determining the best way to print and save them.

I would definitely recommend this camera to everyone, especially to those of you who are trying to stay in touch with distant family and friends via the net.
