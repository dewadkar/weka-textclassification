             When I turned 18, I thought my life in the fast lane was going to be a slow trip within my nifty 4 cylinder Jeep Wrangler. I was actually a little upset and greedy about the whole mess, but I soon learned to live with it. You can imagine my suprize when my dad gave me the keys to our family car, a 1996 Cheverolet Suburban, and announced his purchase of a 1999 Lincoln Navigator. 

I was thrilled. That was a day I will remember forever. I love my Suburban. The first thing I thought was, &quot;Is it just to big for a teenager with absolutley no responsibilities?&quot; No! Its great for carrying friends, family, or in most cases married couple and their children. What I love most about my car is its actually faster than most Ford cars. With a huge V8 Vortech Cheverolet style engine under the hood, you'll be suprised at the great pick-up and awesome power of this car. 

  There are really only a few problems with this great automobile. First and off the top, they are fairly expensive. Believe me though, its the best car our family and I ever had. Also, the gas is fairly expensive due to this monsters 40 gallon gas tank. But, other than those setbacks, the car has never given us any mechanical trouble. Its only had three tune-ups and it still runs like a dream. If you are serious about a nice family car, or just want a big car thats safe and reliable for yourself, this is the one. Make no mistake about it, Bigger Is Better!
