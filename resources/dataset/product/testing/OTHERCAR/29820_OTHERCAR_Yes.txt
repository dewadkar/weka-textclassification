            So I owned this for about a year before it found itself rolling around in my trunk. The LCD broke and the liquid probably shorted out the circuit board because it stopped working. Now that I'm through with the durability test, I'll go on to the important things:

The camera is overall a very nice camera. The DPI isn't some bullsh*t software interpolated piece of junk like most digital cameras are. When companies do this to sell their product, they are saying &quot;if you're an idiot, buy me&quot;. Sure, all of us have had that moment in the compusa where we came across the 100x cdrom and the 1,000,000 dpi scanner. Surely we discovered that it's bullsh*t and were mad at ourselves for being fooled for more than a second about such a thing. Well, like I said, this digital camera isn't a phone.

For quite some time, the DC260 was the best consumer available kodak digital camera. That ended at the release of the DC265 (which I now own) and the DC280.

A year ago, I would have recommended buying the DC260. If you're on a budget and the extra $100 is gonna hurt you, then don't buy the DC265, get this camera (DC260).

This camera is somewhat outdated, so if you're looking for an improvement to the DC260 with not much more of a price, look at the DC265.<br><br>
