            I just got my first new car about 2 months ago, this was a Volvo S40. It wasn't my first choice but considering price tags and other such details it was the most reasonable choice. The car is pretty fun to drive, safe, and good for the college student. Although there are a few details that needed more attention. 

I first, like any 20 year old female, went for the looks when I was going for my new car. Safety is wonderful, but I'd prefer to drive something that doesn't look like a tank. The Volvo S40 is pretty sharp for a 'family car'. The design is pretty good and it is fairly roomy inside. The back seat is a little small. It's enough room to stuff yourself back there, but not really enough for much movement or comfort. 

Volvos are some of the safest cars on the market right now. They are known for their safty. That is a huge factor when it came to buying my car. I'm around terrible drivers all day long on the University campus. I feel much better knowing that if some idiot hits me going 45 that I'll be alot safer than the bimbo in the sports car. Besides, for long trips I prefer the safety because you never know who you will run into. 

The options I chose made the car wonderful. I went for the leather/sunroof/sound package. The leather is very nice, it's not tough like in some cars, it's very soft and it doesn't hold tempurature, which is a great thing when it's hot outside. The sunroof is well placed and a good size, tons of fun. The sound package is extreamly good for a factory sound system. I was very impressed with the sound. 

My lease price was very good, although leasing deals change from dealer to dealer. I feel that I have gotten a great value for my money with this car. 

One problem with the Volvo S40 is it's tiny gas tank. I beleive it is 10-12 gallons. When driving around the city daily, this size just isn't enough. I hate having to stop and fill up over and over. The gas mileage is good, I'm getting about 20-22 in city, but the major draw back is the constant stops to get more gas. 

Yet another problem is the design when it comes to passangers. For the driver, this is a great car, but there are a few problems. Such as only one cup holder in the front, and one in the back. The cup holder in the front goes down and covers the CD player and radio so you can't change CDs or tune with out taking your drink out of the holder. There isn't alot of foot room in the back and you feel like you are stuck in a tiny area when you ride in the back. 

Even with those flaws I still think that the Volvo S40 is a wonderful car. I would chose this one over and over. It's a great car for a college student or a young family. Although, later in life there are several other cars that I would prefer to look into, for now the Volvo S40 is my best choice.
