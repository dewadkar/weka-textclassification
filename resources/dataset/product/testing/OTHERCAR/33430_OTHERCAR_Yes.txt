            My wife and I just purchased a new 2000 Jetta GL with the Luxury and Leather packages.  The basically upgrades the car to the GLX except you do not get the 6 cylinder, 174 hp engine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the pick-up of the 4 cylinder, 115 hp, 5-speed transmission.  In the manual trans this car is still fun to drive despite it's smallish engine.  I personally would not purchase an automatic unless the V6 were installed.

The car was purchased as a commuting car for my wife and I.  We drive approximately 40 miles each way to work and we are very pleased with ride, handling, and noise level within the car.  The front seat of the car is very comfortable with plenty of headroom and leg room to accommodate my 6'4'' frame.  The front seats are equipped with a ratchetting height adjustment that allows the seat to be lowered and raised with great ease.  This is useful for me and my wife as she is much shorter than I.  The controls are well placed and for those used to shifting an American manual transmission the gears on this car are smooth and easy to shift.

The dash lights are done in a blue instrument panel that at first is short of strange.  The interior turn signal light is a yellowish/orange that against the blue light is just plain ugly.  I minor point, but still, something that distracts me.  The rear seat of this vehicle is tiny.  With the front seats all the way back, I could not even get in the back seat.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that even though I am 6'4'', the front seat is so roomy that I do not normally drive with the seat all the way back.  It is slid forward and inch or two.  This actually makes it so I can get in the back, but would not want to ride there for long.

In short, if you like a small car with a lot of options for the money, for the occasional four adult passengers, or two adults and two/three children that gets good mileage and offers front seat comfort, this may be the car for you.  <br>
