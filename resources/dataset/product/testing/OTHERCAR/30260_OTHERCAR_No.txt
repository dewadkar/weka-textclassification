            I had always expressed a desire for a digital camera. My husband bought this camera for me for Christmas last year. I was so excited...until I actually used it. 
The camera is small, lightweight and easily portable, about the size of a pack of cigarettes.
The manufacturer states that it is designed to take VGA quality, (640x480 pixel) 30 bit True Color digital pictures. All I ever got were grainy, blurry, poor quality images. Facial features were distorted, color was muted and, overall, the pictures were a disappointment. 
The ePhoto Smile stores 16 digital images in its 2MB internal memory. The camera uses 2 AA batteries, and you will be very lucky if you can take all 16 pictures without having to replace them. 
The camera comes with PhotoWise 2.0 software to download and store the images on your computer. I had a lot trouble with the software. Finally, after 4 correspondences with the Agfa technical support team, I was able to download my first set of pictures. The downloading itself consumed 2 AA batteries. When I viewed the pictures, it was then I realized that this camera was not a bargain at all.
I must give credit where credit is due. One nice advantage the ePhoto Smile camera has is the capability of previewing your images on a television with the video out cable that is included. This way you have the option of deleting before you download. The pictures on the television are far better quality than when you download, giving a false impression of the quality of your images.
Next time, I will spend more for better quality and clarity.<br><br>
