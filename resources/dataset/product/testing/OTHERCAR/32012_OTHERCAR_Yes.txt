            A month ago I received a substantial offer to purchase my 1989 Acura Legend LS. The car had 125,000 miles and while it was in great shape, I was ready for a change after 7years of owning that car. I purchased a 1997 Lexus ES300 at an auction for $17,200 and am quite pleased. The car has an extremely classy appearance;elegant yet somewhat sporty. It's without a doubt the quietist car I have ever driven. The car handles quite well and is loaded with luxury features.My greatest concern was that the Acura was a luxury car and this was considered &quot;near luxury.&quot; Well, the car outperforms the Legend in almost every way. The Lexus is quieter, gives the driver a better view of the road than the Acura, has a better Stereo system than the Acura Bose and gets better gas mileage. I thought that since it was smaller than the Acura it might not be as comfortable as the Acura. This is the car's main drawback. The front seat is quite comfortable for the driver and a passenger. The rear however has a bit less leg and head room than I had anticipated . My friend who's 6'3&quot; was sitting in the back seat and the top of his head was actually touching the roof liner of the car. Fortunately most of my friends play baseball as opposed to basketball as tall people would not find too much comfort in the back of this car. Other than this , the car is all I had hoped for. Even if it is purchased new, where else can you get a car this good and loaded with features for a price in the very low 30's? I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for luxury and elegance at a modest price.
