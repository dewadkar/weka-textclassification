            <b>When Mercedes introduced a 24-valve variant of its beautifully smooth and responsive 3-litre straight six most people paid more attention to the beautiful lines of the car. The car was based on the same wheelbase as the 300E, or the 4-door version of the car. The Coupe or CE however was much more elegant and much more expensive. The 300CE originally came out in 1988, however an updated model was introduced in 1990 offering newer refinements, which is the model I am testing here. </b>

While living in Germany, my wife owned this car and only recently when we moved to Australia we were ecstatic to find another in pristine condition. With relative haste we purchased the car, and it is a move we have not regretted to date.


<b>Styling</b> 

The 300CE has styling that is very rare in cars today. The 300CE has the most gracious and understated lines of any coupe on the market. The design is so harmonious, yet elegant. The 300CE�s styling fits in perfectly with the rest of the Mercedes-Benz marquees styling at that time. As the car is based on the W124 300E, conservative but attractive looks can be expected. From the front the traditional Mercedes Benz Grille was retained, in the usual style. The three-pointed star adorns the bonnet (which I know affectionately call �The Pedestrian Aim�). Two rectangular headlights adorn the front, however halogen or xenon technology was not existent in 1993 � don�t expect the type of lighting we see on new Mercedes Benz�s today. On later cars headlight wipers were added as well as clear indicator lenses however the earlier models still look very nice from the front.

From the side the 300CE looks at it�s most elegant. The first thing that you notice when looking at the glamorous coupe is the airiness of the design. The car has lots of glass space, contributing to the airiness but I also think it has to be the simplicity of the design. The disadvantage of all this glass is the interior reaches sweltering temperatures in summer. Only being new to Australia we were unaware of how hot it got here � we learnt our lesson when we got in the car during summer as we scolded our skin on the burning hot leather. We have now learnt our lesson and leave the sunroof open during these times. Also contributing to the simplicity of the side view are the pillarless windows. This results in a beautiful uncluttered design. The rear windows are fully retractable � a rare feature in coupes. I have only ever seen that facility in other Mercedes Benzes and a Honda Legend. Wheels on the 300CE are of the Alloy variety, and conservatively styled but nevertheless very elegant. The wide opening front doors allow for easy access to the rear seats as well as a graceful entry into the car. The rear of the car is identical to that of the 300E 4-Door sedan � simple yet elegant but in no way ostentatious. Our car is in �Almandine� which is metallic beige. It suits the style of the car perfectly.


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b>

The 300CE has an interior that is typically German. Everything is of an excellent quality and is totally functional. However I feel that the interior lacks warmth. As with the Mercedes that I used to own, a 1988 560SEL the interior seems like it has been designed totally by engineers. The 300CE has a console that was standard to Mercedes at the time, and I think it is one of the most ergonomic designs ever created. My wife�s car has high gloss walnut veneer that extends the length of the front door as well as covering the whole centre console. The walnut has been applied tastefully but sparingly. Our previous 300CE was made a few years earlier and �Zebrano� wood trim was applied to that interior, which I think is an acquired taste. I recall the gloss on the Zebrano wood turning an opaque white and cracking which is unusual in a Mercedes. We have had no such trouble with the newer car, even in the hotter climate of Australia. The controls of the car are in usual Mercedes simplicity. The centre console is home to the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) controls, Sound System and Miscellaneous Accessories (Rear Headrest Release, Demister, and Hazard Lights) of the car. The interior is beautifully designed, ergonomically supreme but lacks the warmth usually associated with luxury cars.

The seats of the 300CE are the usual standard of Mercedes Benz. All 300CE coupes were fitted with excellent leather trim that remains soft even after 10 years. Don�t expect any cracking, even on the rear headrests. Earlier models had pricked leather; the later models had normal leather. Naturally, being the top of the range 300 series the 300CE had electrically adjustable front seats. Adjustment was made easy via Mercedes� patented electric seat controller. A small controller, in the vague shape of a seat adorns the door. When a certain area of that controller is pushed, the seat moves accordingly to where you have pushed. The driver had 2-position memory while memory for the passenger was optional. Seat heating was optional but neither cars my wife has owned has had the seat heating. Space is more than adequate in the front; the rear seats are quite capable of accommodating two adults for most trips. The rear seat itself only has two seats, as a very useful large storage compartment that is covered in a walnut sliding door/cover takes the centre seat. The compartment is of a usable size and if you have ever travelled in the rear of a coupe you would know that having sufficient storage space is necessary to remain comfortable.  A front and rear armrest is also standard. The trunk is of a good size, which is often a sore point in two door cars.

At the time the 300CE was very well equipped, and defied Mercedes-Benzes tradition of a longer option list than standard feature list. The following items were provided as standard:
<I>Power Windows
Power Passenger�s Mirror (Outrageously No Electric Driver�s Mirror)
Cruise Control
Climate Control (Separate Driver and Passenger Temperature settings)
Sunroof
4-Wheel Anti Lock Brakes
Driver�s Airbag 
Remote Locking</I>
Reaching back for the front seat belts is a common problem with coupe design. Benz engineers solved this by developing an electric feeder system, triggered by the simple act of closing the door after you sat in the car. After hearing the whirring noise of the belt mechanism, the front seat occupant felt a slight tap on the shoulder as it presented the tongue for him to insert in the buckle. Very Useful.


<b>Engine and Handling</b>

The newer 24 valve 3 litre straight six offered excellent performance. The engine is not conspicuously powerful but it's rarely caught short and it delivers what performance it has with superb smoothness. The 24-valve model released in 1990 is significantly more powerful. When driven hard, performance is outstanding. Unlike earlier Benz automatics, the five-speed automatic is happy to kick down without demanding that the driver push the accelerator almost to the floor. Typically the throttle pedal itself retained that long travel which could be disconcerting to those unfamiliar with Benz practice. Fuel consumption is not unreasonable for such an excellent package; approximately 13 litres in the city, around 9 on the highway.

The suspension is excellent and well suited to the car. Ride and handling are superb. Unlike many other European cars, I find the 300CE to be unfussed by appalling roads, soaking up huge bumps disdainfully. The steering is direct and gave good road feel. Few cars have brakes that are as good as those in the 300CE. .

Having now owned and maintained two of these cars I can give the following maintenance tips and what to look our for when purchasing a 300CE:
<b>Fuel Pumps</b> � The 300CE has two and noisy operation means they need replacement.
<b>Timing Chain</b> - These <b><I>MUST</b></I> be maintained  and a broken chain means a new engine.
<b>Engine Mounts</b> - A harsh vibration means these need replacement.
<b>Leaks</b> - This particular engine is known to leak engine oil and transmission fluid.
<b>Engine fan</b> - Viscous coupling set-up can break down, leading to engine overheating. 
This may seem like a large list but providing you keep on top of your maintenance schedule these problems should ever arise.


<b>Final Evaluation</b>

The 300CE is a spectacular automotive achievement. The unmistakeable elegance of the car combined with the excellent charismatic engine make the 300CE one of the best second hand luxury buys in my opinion. If the engine is maintained the 300CE will go on forever, a car that has covered 250 000 kilometres will drive like new. The superb quality of the car is evident with most examples I have seen still with excellent paint and excellent interiors.

Providing you can afford the routine maintenance (Expensive Mercedes Parts) and can live with a two-door car I highly recommend the 300CE. I would know, I have owned two of them! :-D


<I>Note: Mercedes discontinued this model in 1993. It was followed by the 320CE (3.2 litre engine but styling virtually the same) for a short while then the E320C took over under Mercedes Benzes model renaming program.</I>
