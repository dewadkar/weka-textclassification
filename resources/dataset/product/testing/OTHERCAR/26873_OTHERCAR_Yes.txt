            My wife recently leased a 2001 Mercury Sable. She traded in her 1996 Ford Probe. We have a 10 week old and the Probe was not practical.

The Sable is a solid car. I was quite impressed with the 24V DOHC engine - it really moves. The car was pleasingly quiet inside and had good room. We are able to comfortably put the car seat in and out of the back, and 2 additional adults can sit in the back with the car seat as well.

I'll say it again, the car does move. It handles great and steers well. It is a pleasure to drive. I really like the thick steering wheel on the car.

She got a fantastic deal on a lease. She put no money down and is only paying around $350 a month for a 3 year lease. The car is an incredible value.

However, this value comes at a cost. I'm not a big fan of the interior. It's functional, but just plain. Mercury could have done a lot better. It looks outdated. It feels about 3 years out of date compared to similar models form other companies.

Common features like dual climate control are absent on the vehicle. It seems as if they cut their design time just a bit early on the vehicle. With a bit more time it could really be refined and made a world class sedan.

I'm not a big fan of the seats either (leather seats). They're not very contoured and aren't the very comfortable.

However, given what we paid for it and its 5 Star Crash Rating it's really hard to beat. I'd suggest taking one for a good test drive - if you like it chances are you won't find a better value out there.
