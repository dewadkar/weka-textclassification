            I recently purchased a used '99 Oldsmobile Intrigue GL. I had been seeking a mid-sized car and had narrowed my choices to primarily the Intrigue, Intrepid or Concorde.   I have often driven each as rentals so I was pretty much aware of their characters.  In the end it was the Intrigue won out mostly due to the wide extent of standard and optional equipment it had.   Items such as power windows, locks, cruise, tilt, aluminum wheels, power seat, and an automatic transmission are all standard on a GL.  What intrigued (no pun intended) me the most was the standard ABS brakes and traction control, both options on the competition.  The Intrigue I purchased also had the optional Bose Cassette/CD player and factory rear spoiler, all for a outright purchase price of under $13,500.

In '99 the Intrigue can be found in both 3.8 and 3.5 6 cylinder engines.  I searched for a 3.5 version of the car as I find the power to be more fitting my driving style and the engine to be much smoother.   It will not take off from a dead stop like the higher torque 3.8, but for passing and blending with traffic it has few peers anywhere near it's class and price range.   I find it to be a very sophisticated engine (it is based on the Cadillac Northstar system) and the Intrepid's 2.7 cannot match up, neither can the Dodge's optional 3.2 V6.

In my hands-on comparisons, I found the Oldsmobile to be a quieter and nicer riding automobile.  One needed to find an Intrepid ES to really have a competitive machine in most respects.  While I certainly appreciate the subtle styling of the Intrigue, I must admit to being attracted by the stylings of the Daimler-Chrysler duo.  If only I could have the swoopy Intrepid styling and the Intrigue mechanicals and standard equipment, I would be excited indeed.

Before making my purchase on this particular car, I did have a list of items I wanted taken care of.   The car had nearly 30,000 miles on it and it drove beautifully.   However, there were several small items that needed to be replaced or repaired, all in the interior.   My car had missing panels behind the door handles, a missing slide adjuster on one of the dash vents, a hard to open glove box and a hard to close cup holder.  All of these were taken care of under warranty or at the dealers expense.

In summary, I feel there is no better mid-sized used car value than the Intrigue and the higher fare to get into a similar year Accord or Camry is difficult to justify.  The Japanese twins may make excellent new car values, but I find both of those cars highly over priced and a poor used car investment in comparison to the American cars I looked at.   All things considered I recommend anyone looking for a car of this size put the Intrigue (preferably '99 or newer) high on their list of vehicles to consider.<br><br>
