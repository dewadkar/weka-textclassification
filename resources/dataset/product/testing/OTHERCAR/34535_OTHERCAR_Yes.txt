            The photosmart range have always been a good place to start with digital imaging.  This is/was my first digital and has lasted me close to three years now (recently upgraded to a Sony).

The build quality of this camera is strong though slightly 'plastic' to feel with a small amount of give in the body when holding it.  It survives a drop quite well (though not recommended) and doesn't contain anything within the body that will easily snap off.  It's shape means it slips into a camera bag easily.

Operation is simple.  Just slide back the lens cover and you're ready to shoot.  focus and exposure can be set to auto and the camera does a great job of getting it right in a large amount of conditions.  Point and shoot at it simplest.

Macro is an issue though.  While the booklet says it'll do a good job, in reality it doesn't  Anything close than 12 inches or so will be blurred badly.  Midrange to infinity however as crisp and clear, though slightly washed out in color.

At 1 megapixel it's dated now.  Details aren't as high as newer cameras though at it's highest setting, you can still produce printable photos at A4 size.

The serial cable means it downloads slowly (40 low qaulity images takes close to 10 minutes to download from the camera), but the supplied software is excellent, allowing for editing and rotating of images before saving.

A serious letdown is the LCD on the back of the camera.  It's virtually useless if you move the camera itself - an incredibly slow refresh rate means images strobe about once a second, and show up dark and discolored.  Best to forget it's there and just use the viewfinder unless accessing the menus.
