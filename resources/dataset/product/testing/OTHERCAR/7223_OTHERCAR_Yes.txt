            When we bought our 1999 Mercury Cougar, it was the first year of the new style, and we were very excited to find a NEW car that offered a hatchback without being completely ugly. Since it was based on the Ford Contour chassis, we felt comfortable enough that major bugs would be worked out. We decided to get the Sport and Convenience packages but skipped the leather seats. 

While shopping for this car, we compared it to the 1999 Chevy Cavalier, Hyundai Tiburon, and Saturn SC1. The Cougar's V6 gave it much more power than any of these 4-cylinder competitors. The car has much less body roll than the only other hatchback in the group (the Tiburon) and handled on par with the Cavalier and Saturn.

<b>Features:</b>
Manual transmission (5 speed), CD Player with speed control (gets louder as you go faster and softer as you slow down), rear wiper, front wheel drive.  

Dash computer indicates trip mileage, miles per gallon, miles til empty (and will automatically switch to that and beep when you're 50 miles til empty).

<i>Sports package:</i> 4-wheel disc brakes, 16 inch wheels, spoiler

<i>Convenience package:</i> Cruise control, remote keyless entry, passive alarm, glove box light, Warning lights including brake sensor light, cold weather and frost warnings, and maintenance due light.

<i>Options we didn't get:</i> ABS, front side-impact air bags, traction control, sunroof.

<b>"Undocumented" features (bugs):</b>
<i>Brake sensor:</i> We've had our brake sensor light come on even though our brakes are fairly new. We have taken it into the dealership to have it fixed and they have told us that the sensor was loose, and they fixed it. A few days later, the light came on again.  

<i>Cupholder:</i> The cupholder is in the center console and pulls up and tilts... which makes it quite easy to spill your full glass right into your lap (yet another reason why we replaced our cloth seats -- see below, under Lumbar Support). The pop-up cupholder was replaced with a new design in mid-2000. <b>DO NOT use the cup holder for anything but sealed bottles of soda!</b>

<i>Hatchback latch:</i> We've had the latch in the hatchback "door" adjusted because it wasn't closing properly, and it would squeak. In addition, when the weather warms up, the latch sticks and we have to constantly hit the "trunk open" and be ready to lift the hatchback door immediately when it unlatches.

<i>Tires:</i> We had two or three flat tires within the first year of owning this car. We managed to have them patched and didn't need new tires at that point. We had to replace our tires around 60,000 miles and had a difficult time finding the size we needed for the car. 

<i>Oil pan Gasket:</i> We also had the oil pan gasket replaced because it was leaking.  

<i>Lumbar support:</i> The lumbar support in the cloth seats were very uncomfortable and we decided to upgrade to power leather seats from a 2001 Cougar about a year ago. It has been MUCH better, but it's still not a great car for long drives.

<i>Rear seats:</i> Unless you're a small person, the rear seats are not the most comfortable in the world; cloth or leather. They are bucket seats that slope back, so this is only a 4-seater car. The rear seat leg room is better than some sporty cars, but tall people would still have difficulty.

<i>Blind Spots:</i> One of the big problems with the sleek design is a LARGE blind spot. The side mirrors are teardrop-shaped, which leaves out a large section of the side of the car. Get a blind spot mirror if you buy one of these cars and still be sure to double-check before changing lanes.

<i>Door dings:</i> This car seems to attract door dings. Of all the cars we have owned, this one seems to get a ding from the slightest door nudge from another car.

<i>Brakes:</i> Many other Cougar owners had to have the original brakes changed very soon. When we got the car, we had a problem with a grinding sound and had to get that fixed (the problem also seemed to be very common). When we had to finally get the brakes replaced, no generic or "top notch" brakes would stop squealing like a school bus. We finally had to bring it in to the dealer for factory brakes (which are not cheap) and we still have some minor squealing.

<b>Other:</b>
We really enjoy our car; it has a lot of get-up-and-go, even for a small (2.5L) V6 engine. We have heard that automatic transmissions are not as peppy as the manual transmissions and would recommended sticking to the manual. 

Our gas mileage has been pretty good -- 28-30MPG highway and around 18-21MPG for true stop-and-go city driving. The car is very easy to drive, and is a great car to teach someone how to drive a manual transmission.  The clutch is light, and it doesn't require much effort to shift.

It's still a great looking car, but a lot of manufacturers have decided to follow its lead making the Cougar look like almost every other sporty-looking car.  The turning heads were great while it lasted. :)
