            I was in the market for my first digital camera.   I have been a film photographer for over 20 years using SLRs and compact cameras.  I wanted something small enough to fit into my pocket to take snapshots  while traveling. It was a daunting task to sort through all the features, specs and hype surrounding digital cameras these days.  I thought I wanted 4+ megapixels but after talking to several people decided that would be overkill for what I wanted to do with the camera.  Battery life was a major issue as we are going to be traveling by boat this spring and carrying extra batteries is a pain.  After playing with a friends Fuji, I was impressed with the ease of use and excellent picture quality even at the 1 megapixel setting.  I looked at the 2650 first but decided that it was too big for the pocket and it also used the older memory chips.  By chance I saw the  specs for the A203 and was impressed by the small size and good preliminary reviews (unfortunately, none were on this site) None of the retailers in our area carried the camera so I was once again forced to jump in blind (see my other reviews) and buy it online without ever seeing it.

I could have bought it cheaper, but I ended up buying at pcmall.com, due to there excellent customer service.  At the same time I also ordered the 128 mb xD chip at a pretty good price.

The camera was on my desk at work the next morning.  Within five minutes I was taking pictures and having fun....all with minimal reading of the instruction manual (Hey....I am techno guy....who needs the manual:?)  Taking pictures is easy, just point and shoot.  The optical viewfinder is good and is linked to the optical zoom.  To use the digital zoom, you need to use the LCD display.  I played around all afternoon and by the end of the day I was pretty comfortable with all of the things the device can do.  There is a self timer for those fun group pictures, a pretty good macro setting and a movie recorder  for up to 20 seconds with no sound.  All of these features are selectable with an easy to use wheel.  For menus on the LCD, there are an enter and escape key and you use the zoom and picture scrolling keys to navigate.

I have shot almost all of my pictures at the 1MP resolution and I am very happy with the results.  I was blown away by the quality when I went to 2MP-fine.  Using the 1MP setting and the 128MB chip, I can store 398 photos on the camera....wow...a whole week of vacation. The only thing I worry about is having something happen to the chip and loose it all, but I guess that could happen with all of your film too.  I have done research and have found out that memory cards are uneffected by the new high powered security x-ray scanners.  Another reason to switch from film.

So far batteries havent been an issue but I did buy two sets of AA NiMh batteries and a one hour charger (Also works off of 12V for the car and the boat) I have hheard thaty you can get 200 pics from a set of alkaline so 500 to 600 from the rechargeables is possible.

Only a few negatives:  The flash has five possible settings, each denoted in the LCD finder by a tiny icon. The icon is not easy to see for those of us approaching middle age. not a huge problem but if it was a little larger it would be great.

I am used to taking pictures with a film camera so that when you click the shutter it takes the picture NOW.  The slight delay is annoying when trying to capture action  I took the camera to the St. Pete Grand Prix this weekend and had a hard time getting the pictures I wanted.  The delay while the camera writes to memory is not too bad but once again I am used to a 5 frame per second motor drive on an slr.  I am sure that I will get used to it eventualy.


UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I have Just returned from a week long cruise in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas.  Thanks to the A203 I have over 500 images of my trip to enjoy and share.  The camera performed much better than I had ever hoped for.   I ended up using alkaline batteries instead of bringing 2 sets of NiMH and the charger as space was limited in our luggage while traveling by boat. Also electrical management is always a concern while cruising, so I opted to avoid the whole scenario.  Using the camera lots, I was able to do the entire week with an 8 pack of AA cells. Not too bad.

I was shooting images constantly over the week. My friends were saying "That will never turn out".....Surprise, Surprise.  When everyone sees the images they say "WOW!".

I am so impressed with this camera, I am ready to make the jump to a better one.....Hmmmm, let's check the review for the Fuji S602....."Honey, Where is the credit card?".
