            We bought our 99 Dodge Grand Caravan LE after realizing that we needed more room for our two children.  By far, the Grand Caravan has more room that many of its competing models.  I love the way it drives (more like a car, than a van) and the options that we have (roof rack, CD player, etc.) are nice.  BUT, buyers beware....En route to a friends house, with only 3,800 miles on the van, my &quot;CHECK ENGINE&quot; light came on and the van began to act funny.  Upon bringing it to the dealer, I was told that our transmission was gone and it would have to be replaced - but, not to worry, it was under warranty.  Three days later, I had my van back.  Months later, with only 6,800 miles on the van, we were on our way back from vacation and the &quot;CHECK ENGINE&quot; light came on again and the van acted the same way as when the transmission went the first time.  Upon bringing it to the dealer, I was told that it was some computer chip that had trigger and failed when the transmission went the first time - still transmission related.  My van now has approximately 11,000 and thankfully, we haven't had any problems since, but I am always on my guard and am hesitant to take this van on a long trip, for fear that I will end up stranded somewhere.  The Dodge Grand Caravan is a great van overall as far as roominess and comfort, but you would think that Dodge would have corrected their transmission problems by now!!<br><br>
