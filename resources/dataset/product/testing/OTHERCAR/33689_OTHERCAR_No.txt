            This is one of the two cars that I have owned that I can truthfully say that I loved.  If you want quick acceleration, this one does quite well for a family sedan.  Even the bottom of the line models have sporty looks.  It rides like a dream.  I have to drive down a road that has been washed out numerous times, this car handles the bumps and holes better than any other vehicle I have ridden in on that road.  The controls are easy to find and use.  The low traction light and anti-lock brakes are wonderful features that I will insist on having in all of my future vehicles.

Unfortunately, this vehicle doesn't seem to be one that will go to the 200,000 club with-out some major repairs and replacements.  My car has 106,000 miles on it and so far I have replaced the tranny, had my right front tire reattached after a gasket failed and allowed the piece that attached the tire to the axle to fail, and I had to have the entire steering column torn apart to replace a switch.
Things that are in current need of repair is the driver's side window controls, the motors in the driver's and front passenger's windows, the power locks need to have something done to them as they keep trying to lock themselves, and I have a funny grinding that seems to be coming from one of my front tires while the car is in reverse.  (But no one can figure out what it is.)  Also, my headlights are wired directly into the ignition and while the ignition switch is in the "on" position, there is no way to turn off the lights.
