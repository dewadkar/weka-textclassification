            I currently have owned my Audi A4 2.8L Quattro for nine months.  It has been a pleasure to have.  When my husband and I were looking for a new car to purchase we looked at BMW, Mercedes, and Audi.  Both the BMW 325is and the Mercedes 300 series offered quality but at a higher price.  The Audi offered the same amenities but for considerably less...approximately $5000 less.

My Audi is equipped with tiptronic auto/manual transmission.  This is more for fun and play then it is practical.  I do enjoy being able to switch over to manual when I want more acceleration or control.  It also has the premium Bose stereo and 6 disc changer.  This is a great option and sounds very clear and crisp.  We opted for the leather sport seats and found them very comfortable and durable.  We went with the sports package and received a sunroof, 7 spoke 16 inch wheels, sport steering wheel, and sport suspension.  I would highly recommend this package as it turns a compact sedan into a sports car, comparable with the BMW 325is.

Again, the Audi A4 is a quality car for a great value.  Don't miss checking it out.<br><br>
