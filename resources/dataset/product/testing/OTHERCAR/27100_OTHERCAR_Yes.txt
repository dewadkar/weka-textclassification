            <B> Intro</B>
Before I start the review, a little truth in advertising:
I had a previous review written about this car from a utilitarian and comfort view point.  Unfortunately, a Cadillac speeding through a red light (40+ MPH) allowed me to test the safety of the car.
<p>
This review primarily addresses my expeirence with the car.  Both the 6 months of ownership, and my experience as a SAAB crash test dummy.  <p>
<B>My experience</B>

I Owned my 2001 SE for exactly six months.  It was the nicest, best performing, and most comfortable car I have ever owned or even rode in. The car was peppy, held the road like glue, had a great sound system, and had a very flexible sound system.  Also the car was very safe.  SAAB advertises �real life safety�.  I found that to be true � by accident.  I had to go to home depot; normally I would have taken the other car, but my wife told me to take the SAAB.  She stayed home with our 3 month old.  On the way home from Home Depot, I came up to an intersection where I needed to make a left turn.  The light was green, so I entered the intersection.  Traffic was moderate.  The light turned yellow.  I was in the intersection and watching the oncoming traffic.  The traffic in the right lane had stopped, and I did not notice anyone in the left lane.  I looked up and noticed that the light was now red, and I was blocking the other traffic (which was honking).  So, I proceeded with my left turn.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something: A big car speeding through the red light.  The next thing I recall was screaming and then nothing for a few moments (not really sure how long).  I was then aware of the engine running and the windshield washers running (it was a sunny day).  But, I felt ok.  The passenger side was bashed in -- badly, and there were three deflated airbags (dual front and side).  I stopped the car and got out.  I noticed that the rescue squad was just pulling up.  
<P>
One thing to note is one of the highly advertised features of Onstar (in 2001 SAAB's) is the call after airbag deployment.  They did not call me.

<B>Performance</B>
<p>
<b>Driving</b>
The SAAB 9-5 SE has a 3.0L turbocharged engine.  The engine has 200 HP, but it feels like much more, probably the result of a flat torque curve (meaning peak thrust at relatively low RPM�s).  Because of the low-end torque, it is easy to spin the wheels.  However, the car does have traction control, which helps on wet roads.  When driving at speed, engine response is instant, thrusting everyone into the seat.  Handling is superb.  I am not sure how to quantify handling; however, qualitatively, I always felt in control of the car.  Yet, the ride is refined � not harsh, but not mushy, just right.  Steering inspired confidence. I have nothing but positives regarding the driving experience.  I only regret I did not get to drive the vehicle more.<p>
<b>Crash Performance</b>
This section will focus on damage to the car and intrusion into the passenger area.  Keep in mind that high speed side impacts are as bad as it gets.  There is very little mass to dissipate the collision. First, the driver�s compartment was fine.  The passenger seat (front and rear) were compressed about 30%; however, they maintained their shape.
The Passenger site B-pillar intruded by 18"; however, the intrusion was mostly below the seat; the area near the torso and head had minimal intrusion.  I am told that it is designed that way to deflect the force of the impact away from the driver.  The infant car seat, in the rear-center location was undisturbed.  The cargo, in the storage area, was tied down and stayed in place, thanks to the excellent cargo holding facilities.
<B>
Now for the bad:</b>
Anyone in either the front or rear passenger seat would probably had leg and/or hip injuries.  They probably would have survived, though.  The car was bashed in such that the passenger doors could not open; however, the glass was gone.  In addition, the rear hatch and hood were jammed closed.  Finally, the driver�s side rear door was difficult to open.  The glove compartment was wedged shut (and shortened).  The center console was crushed.  The whole frame of the car was bent around the impact point by about 15 degrees.
<p>
Now for the scary: the impact knocked out the fuel filter, and the car was leaking gas.  I am told this is probably the result of the fuel filter being on the passenger side.
<p>
<B>Comfort/Ergonomics</B><p>
The SAAB is an extremely comfortable car for 4 people.  The seats are unbelievably comfortable.  They also provide a lot of support.  Driving position is nearly ideal.  Everything about the car focuses on the driver, from the �night� mode which darkens most of the interior lights to the angle of the dash, which curves around the driver.  Everything is in easy reach.  The only negatives I have are: the back seat is tight with 5 people, particularly if one is an infant in a car seat.  Also, while the dash cup holder is �cool� and useful, that is the only useful cup holder in the car. And the Harmon Kardin Sound System is great � the best I have ever heard in a car. It is worth noting that everything in the car has a purpose.  For example, the center console mounted ignition switch protects the drivers knee�s in a frontal collision. 
<p><b>Utility</B><p>
This is station wagon.  It is not a mini-van.  It only seats 5; SAAB resisted the temptation to put in two additional seats in the cargo area (ala Volvo V70) because that is a rear crumple zone.  I think that is good, because I would not want my children in a crumple zone.  With that said, it has a very flexible cargo area.  With the rear seats up, it has 37 cubic feet of storage.  That allows for the stroller, big suitcase, baby swing, pack-and play, and a few other items.  The cargo area also has places to tie down the cargo, which keeps the cargo from shifting.  That is very important in an accident.  With the rear seat half down, there is room four 4 people (though we only tried 2 adults + infant in car seat).  That configuration allows for about 30% more cargo space, which can be important.  With both seats down, the cargo space increases to about 77 cubic feet.  Note that the cargo area is comparable to the Toyota Highlander or Nissan Pathfinder SUV�s.<p>
<b> Cost</B><p>
Cost was 30,500 for a demo model when we bought ours.  They are more expensive today.  2002 Arc wagon runs about 35,000; 2002 linear wagon well equipped runs 32,500.  This is about 10K less than a comparable BMW.
<p><B>Summary:</B><p>
The car is a very good car.  Ignoring the safety issues, it is comfortable and performs well.  Similar to a BMW 525.  When safety is factored in, buying the SAAB becomes a no-brainer � if this car meets your space needs.  I survived with only minor bruises. All passengers probably would have survived with non-life threatening injuries.  
I can not say how another car would have done; but I am sure happy I was in the SAAB.
<p>
With that said, we did not buy another SAAB.  The space was a little too tight with five people (4 adults + infant in car seat) and our small dog.  The dog had to sit in the cargo area, and while she was ok, that reduced the available cargo area to about 15 cubic feet, which gave room for the (big) stroller, a good size cooler, and the diaper bag.  
Instead we bought a minivan (Toyota Sienna).
<b>
One other note:  the car held its value; the value of the total loss was greater than our purchase price.  In addition, replacing our wagon with an equivalent 2001 would have cost about 2500 more than we paid.
