We bought our CRV in the summer of 1998, and love it!  We went from an Accord to the CRV because we wanted a little more height in heavy traffic, but did not want an SUV.  The CRV has just enough power for me. I can fit five people comfortably, and have room for lots of luggage and/or groceries.  The '98 CRV handles great in snow and on icy streets.  The sound system is great!  This is a great vehicle for anyone who is looking for more space than you would get in a car, but doesn't really want the responsibility of an SUV.<br><br>
