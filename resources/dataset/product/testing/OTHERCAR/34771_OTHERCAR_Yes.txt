            I purchased my 1991 Dodge Monaco because I thought it was an outstanding value. Chrysler had purchased AMC and because of that had a contract with Renault for a specific number of engines (I originally was told it was a specific number of drive trains, whatever). The LX model was very well equipped for $11,000, which was much less than the Eagle Premier version of the same vehicle and much more car than the �native� equivalently priced Chrysler products of the day. The only option I purchased was ABS, which I thought was extremely expensive.

The car made quite a few trips to the dealership during my first year of ownership. Most of the reasons were due to both gasket and other engine leaks and this problem with �restarting� the car. This �restarting� problem occurs when the engine is started cold and then quickly turned off. The next attempts to start the engine are futile, with the engine cranking but not starting. Each time I had it towed to the dealer they would tell me that everything is fine. After I noticed the pattern, I simply never started the engine cold without letting it run for 5 minutes or more! I had no �restarting� problem for almost 8 years. And then I recently moved the car from one spot to another in the driveway and the problem demonstrated to me that it was waiting, not gone. The only other complaints are the AM/FM radio died and the paint has started to flake off which is common with Chrysler products from the early 1990�s.

What I really like about the car besides the value is the size for both passengers and cargo. There is a huge trunk and 5 adults can travel comfortably. The gas mileage is good (high 20�s and sometimes in the 30�s MPG) during long trips. It handles very nicely and has a tighter turning radius than my 1998 Saturn SL2, a compact car. While it didn�t take me very long to adjust to the French influenced controls, others that have driven it briefly had problems though.

I would recommend this car to someone that wanted inexpensive solid transportation. I haven�t met many other owners and those I have none have had the �restarting� problem that mine has. Another plus is the styling is very nice (to me at least) and there is an Audi model from that era. So it is possible that it could be mistaken for the more expensive Eagle Premier or the much more expensive Audi. Don�t purchase one if you are concerned about repairs, as there were so few manufactured that the prices for parts are quite high.
