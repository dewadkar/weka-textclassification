            Our Chevy S-10 is dependable and reliable, and has held up well to all we have put it through.  We bought ours new in 1992 with less than 100 miles on the odometer.  It now reads almost 150,000 and we are starting to think of a new one, but only because this is currently our only vehicle and nothing lasts forever.

When we bought this vehicle, we chose the extended cab version because it will seat 4 adults comfortably for short rides or 2 to 3 for longer ones (or provide plenty of space for our 4-legged family).  With the cap we added, we have found it perfect for hauling everything from bikes, to gardening supplies to large amounts of luggage, shopping, or garage sale and antique auction finds.  We have recently heard that Chevy may be coming out with a crew cab version soon, and are hoping that this information is true.  Although we love our truck, one of the few drawbacks is that for adults, crawling in and out of the back seats can be difficult, and are looking forward to the possibility of a little more room and a couple of extra doors.

As for other aspects, we have found the transmission to be a little weak for pulling loaded trailers over hills and/or mountains and would suggest the addition of a towing package to anyone considering this type of use.  We have had little or no mechanical problems other than this one weakness, but thought that it warranted mentioning, as we no longer pull trailers for the above reason.

We chose vinyl seats, which can be difficult to get without a special order, but were perfect for us to take our 4-legged family along.  Purchasers have the option of vinyl, cloth, or leather, but our vinyl ones have just recently started to show a little wear, and are what I would recommend to anyone with children or pets as they are much easier to keep clean than the other options.

Also, with regard to the seats, my husband finds the back support a little lacking, and solves this problem by use of a back pillow.  This is only a minor problem for us, but for those with serious back problems, this is something to consider.

Overall, we love our truck, and are not looking forward to the possibility of having to eventually trade it in, but we feel that its younger sibling will be just the thing to ease the pain when that time comes, and would recommend the same purchase to anyone looking for reliable, dependable, and versatile transportation.<br><br>
