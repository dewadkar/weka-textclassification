            My husband and I bought our '94 Skylark used in 1995. It had 23,000 miles on it, but was still under warranty. The price was right, and the payments fit our budget, so we chose the Skylark over other models we looked at. 

I love the way the car rides like a luxury model, ours is equipped with a dynaglide suspension system, and it is really smooth on the highway. We have been on several long trips in this car, and have not had any problems while on the road. 

We have had some problems with the fan motor, had to replace it last year, and the dimmer switch as well. We put over 140,000 miles on it when it started leaking water into the oil. We had to replace the engine, and I do not like the new engine as well as I did the old one, but that isn't the cars fault. 

If you are looking for a dependable, low-priced vehicle, this is definitely one you should check out. While I don't know much about the newer models, we have been happy with our '94 since we purchased it, and it has held up well to the extreme use we put it through.<br><br>
