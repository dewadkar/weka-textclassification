            . 
The 99 Dodge Caravan is a joy to drive, comfortable,safe, fuel consumeson
low for this type of vehicle.  Safety is a first as the driver sits higher
from the road and is able to detect problems ahead. visability is good to
excellent. The road handling is smooth with good pickup after stops.
This is an excellent vehicle for a young growing family or middle age male
who is in business and must haul stuff. Good storage room for boxes without removing the seats.  Great storeage room with seats removed.  So if you have kids or are into hauling packages, this is a luxury vehicle which will serve your purpose. <br><br>
