            We bought our new 2001 Sienna in December 2000. It was our first minivan. Not being an expert on minivans, I can't say how it compared to others. We had a rattling sound in the back door that went away. The front driver's door seemed to be slightly off its alignment. Other than those two things, no other problems. The handling seemed OK -- when you accelerate it takes longer, since it's a heavy car. We were happy with the space in the van, given the car-sized platform. Plenty of room in all seats. All seats in the 2nd and 3rd row are easy to fold or remove -- but they are heavy, and you have to store them outside of the car.  The dashboard and other amenities in the car were nicely placed. We loved the outdoor temp gauge, the sound system, a cupholder for every seat, lots of pockets, lights, rear heating/AC, & power door.

This November, I was taking a left turn, when the oncoming car decided to speed through the yellow/red light. My van was hit on the right side. The oncoming car dented the right side, from the 2nd row to the back. Then my van fell on its left side, denting the back door, breaking the back and front windshield. The van slid 10 yards. Every window on the left broke and the side was scraped and slightly dented. The van was "totaled". It took the whole impact of the crash. I got out through the drivers side window. I walked away, thank God.
