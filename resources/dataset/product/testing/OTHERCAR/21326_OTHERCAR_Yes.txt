            When I decided to buy a new car.  The most important thing I was looking for was a very reliable and functional car.  Anyone who has dealt with mechanical problems and getting their car fixed knows that its a royal pain.  So I needed something with four doors, seating for five, decent trunk space, good power, something that will last for a long time given the proper care.  Which cars are the most reliable? - well if you browse through Consumer Reports - Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Subaru make the most reliable cars.

Well that narrowed the choices down to the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and Subaru Outback.  The Nissan Maxima, although cheaper than the Camry was more expensive to insure.  In addition, the Maxima had a higher mortality rate - understandable given the more aggressive handling / performance you get from a Maxima and the type of drivers of those kinds of cars.  The Honda Accord appeared to be stolen more often as many parts are interchangeable with other Honda cars (even from different years).  The Toyota has a better powertrain warranty than the Honda.  The Subaru Outback did not have a six cylinder engine.  Thus, I picked the Camry XLE with V6 loaded with sunroof, leather, and alloy wheels.

Upon driving this car, I immediately noticed how it felt and sounded like a luxury car.  In fact, it uses the same platform as the Lexus ES300.  Its so quiet and the engine so refined that it feels like you can drive all day in it without being tired.  The engine is smooth and powerful and passing with the V6 195hp engine is no problem.  Premium fuel is recommended for the V6.      

Interior: It is almost perfect.  Everything is laid out nicely and where expected.  For example, most drivers use the radio more than the temperature controls.  The radio is set above the temperature controls where they can be easily reached while driving.  Note that the 2000 Honda Accord has it reversed.  There are two trip odometers, gear indication on the dashboard, separate clock, pockets on the back of both front seats, map pockets on both front doors, two compartments (for coins, etc.), two map lights, sunglass holder / garage door remote holder.  You can lock the glove compartment.  You can fold down both rear seats to give yourself more storage space and when not needed, the seats can be locked in its upright position.  Ample knee room for those in the back seat.  Very comfortable for four - will sit five people.

Safety:  Two front and side airbags.  ABS, Traction Control, heated side mirrors, day time running lights, rear window lockout, and three point seat belts for five passengers.  Full sized spare (not many competitors can make this claim).  Car feels solid.

Other: You can lock the trunk so that the valet key cannot open it.  You'll never leave the car lights on again and suffer a dead battery because when you shut the ignition, the headlights go out.  The headlights and dashboard lights also goes on and off automatically based on how light / dark it is outside (but daytime running lights are always on).  There are lips on the sides of the windshield so that water will not streak to the sides of the car.  Ignition keys have a microchip that has to match the chip in the ignition before the car will start.  Copied keys will not work.

Only gripes (and thats just because I'm fairly particular):  Unless you purchase an aftermarket alarm / trunk release mechanism, you can't open the trunk with the car remote - you still have to pull the lever next the driver's side seat.  Factory car alarm does not chirp when arming / disarming (the lights only blink).  Side mirrors are not the &quot;break away&quot; mirrors and thus, can't be folded in when in tight spots or for when accidentally bumped into.    

Small families will do very well with this car.  People looking for a &quot;sports&quot; sedan (e.g., handling at the expense of a comfortable ride, etc.) should not buy this car - they should buy the Maxima.

Again, I stress reliability as a key selling point.  Toyota makes one of the most reliable cars out there (i.e., Toyota Corolla).  When you drive a Camry, (unless its a lemon and unless you don't perform routine maintenance) you have comfort that the car will give you years and years of trouble free service.

Good luck!<br><br>
