            "Ew, you wanna get the Poor-Man's Porsch", my girlfriend said when I brought home the sales book for the 2000 Boxster S. "No, that was the 924, sugar plum. This car will run circles around that lemon AND you can get a tan!" My previous car was a mint 1970 Mercedes 280SL that someone decided they deserved more than I did. Three days after it was stolen, it was recovered completely stripped. When I went to "ID the body", I decided that my next car will be another convertible, but one with a roar. The list was short. I drove the revvy Honda S2000 and hated it. That car reminded me of the FedEx guy in those old commercials, all wound up and talking too fast. I drove the BMW M3 roadster and while it was wonderful to drive, I hated it. Call me crazy, but it looks like a shoe, and I'm sorry, but I have a problem driving a car that, when the top is down, my forehead gets as much bug splatter as the windshield. Last, and just for fun, I drove the new Ferrari. Well, ummm, I didn't want to sell my house to get it, if you understand my point. That left the Boxster S. The reviews are not all hype. The car is every bit as fun as Road and Track keeps on claiming it is, and they are not ashamed to keep on claiming it. The extra horsepower over the regular Boxster is fine, but that extra torque is what really sets it apart. That combined with the buttery shifter, 18" wheels and cross-drilled brakes means I'm not losing too many races (not that I'd do that sort of thing). Coming from a family that owns two vintage McLaren race cars, I needed something that could give me the same kind of thrills I get on the track while driving off the track. The Boxster S definitely thrills.

One great thing about the Boxster in general is that it is very practical for a two-seat roadster. Yeah, trunk space isn't always a consideration when buying a car that is specifically meant to pin your head back in your seat, but Porsche did a good job nonetheless. Some may think this isn't that important, but I'm here to tell you that the Boxster's two trunks are a major selling point in my opinion. Two recent trips to Vegas proved that trunk space is like prime real estate, and while it isn't like a Mercedes' cavernous trunk, it's got enough for two people to pack enough things for a weekend away. The only bummer about road trips is that the seats don't recline very far, so very long trips have the potential to get uncomfortable, and who wants a soda between their legs for 300 miles?

What would an honest review be without pointing out the bad things as well? To start, the stereo is absolutely awful. I am a sound engineer by trade and I like to hear decent sound on the road. Granted, the physics of acoustics dictate that achieving full-frequency sound is near impossible in something that essentially resembles a bathtub. That said, I just heard the Levinson-designed sound system in the new Lexus convertible, and it's awesome. Sound in a convertible can be made to be very good, and for the amount of cash you are going to drop on the S, you'd hope Becker would try to do a little better. Porsche does try to make up for it by providing an in-dash DSP (Digital Signal Processor) section for the stereo, but this bothers me for two reasons. One, it takes away the cup holders (more on those later), and two, it's too much fiddling around for the average consumer. Who cares about hearing a hall reverb on Sammy Hagar while driving 95 (because you can't drive 55)? The CD holder is nice, but I'd honestly rather have a cup holder. The way my car is configured, more than half the center console down to the shifter is devoted to crappy audio with no stupid cup holder. Aaaagh!

On a lighter note, I sometimes miss my Mercedes. That car was a classic in the truest sense. It had no frills, smelled of gas, overheated on hot summer days, and made heads turn wherever it went. It was, to say it bluntly, a CAR. But as I spend more time with the Boxster, I realize that the advances of the last 30 years are not all bad. One point in particular is the convertible top. I was lucky if I could get the top up in the Mercedes by myself. On a good day, it took 2-3 minutes, and that was if the top had only recently been put down and hadn't contracted all that much. And no matter what, I had to get out of the car to perform the operation. It was a real pain most of the time. Ahh, but in my Boxster, all I do is stop, pull the hand brake, undo a latch and push a button. 12 seconds later, I'm off. I will never go back to doing it the old way. And to those of you who point out that the new Lexus does it in half the time, ask yourself one question: Do those extra six seconds really matter? If they do, you probably shouldn't be driving a convertible. I'm just thankful I no longer have to get out of the car to get a little open-air fun. And let me tell you, there is nothing like the sound of the S-type's mid-engine roar with the top down!

I looked for an S for about a month and was ready to put down a deposit and special order one when I went to a dealership in Santa Monica, California. There on the showroom floor was a fully-loaded Midnight Blue 2000 S, but when I saw the sticker price of $72K, I about hit that same floor. Apparently a famous rock musician (I can't say who but if you Don't Stop Believin' I'll tell you, Oh Sherry, with Open Arms) ordered the car and then decided that he wanted a Tiptronic instead. The guy ordered this thing with the full leather package, turbo-look wheels, painted rollbar, the works (except a cup holder). I was a little hesitant to plunk down that much money on this or any car, especially since that's getting into stock 911 territory. Luckily, the dealer was motivated because the car had sat undriven for a couple of months, which is an eternity in a Porsche dealership. Apparently everyone who looked at the car couldn't justify paying that much for a Boxster, but I will now tell you that if you have the extra money, get the car with as much as you can!!! The leather is amazing - the nicest I've seen. And one thing I'm discovering that I can't live without is seat warmers. Sure, Southern California has the wimpiest weather in the country, but it sure is nice to be able to leave the top down while driving home on a cool summer night. My girlfriend is now convinced.

Conclusion: what the Boxster S costs over the standard Boxster is worth every penny. The way I figure it, I certainly won't be buying another car until this one's long since paid off, if ever, so I'll actually be saving money by not buying a new car every four years. The Boxster S
continues to put a grin on my face, despite the missing cup holder.
