            THe Dodge Viper... Ohh how sweet...  The car boats a 8.0 liter V10 engine that pumps out 450 hp for a top speed of 199 mph.  Trust me, its the top speed :)  The car red lines at 6900 rpm, which is just right for me.  The car rides so smooth because of its independent front and rear suspension and a stablizer bar.  

The 1999 Viper I have a 6 speed manaual transmission, power everything, and an Alpine CD player with the speakers.  The car weighs 3375 lbs, which may seem kinda heavy, but the car moves.  Moving from 0-60 in just a little over 4.0 seconds.  

The time came when I was driving it on the road, when I came to a red light.  Of course I have everyone looking at the car (Its the blue with white stripes).  Another car pulled up and sure enough it was a Chevrolet Corvette, drivin by a teenager.  Of course when he shifted in neutral and started 'racing' his engine I knew he wanted a race.  I waited and waited for the light to change.  Sure enough as soon as it did, I shifted to first and both of our tires spun, smoke pouring out the wheelbase.  Out of second gear I was moving.  The tires stopped spinning and I was doing about 80 down the road with the vette still keeping up.  Finally out fourth gear I totally blew him away.  Doing around 120 down the wide stretch of road.  

For everyhting I paid almost $85,000.  Now... no I'm not rich and no I dont have rich parents.  I took a loan out from the bank and I'm making payments on it now. <br><br>
