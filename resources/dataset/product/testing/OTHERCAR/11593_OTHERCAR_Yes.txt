            I recently bought a 99 RODEO LS (V6) in my opinion this is an excellent SUV (I don't say this about many vehicle's).  
GOOD POINTS:
strong engine, good brakes, plenty or room, nice outward appearance,
great dealership support, great warranty, price (I paid under 20,000).
same as the Honda passport but much cheaper

BAD POINTS:
A/C is not strong enough to keep vehicle cool on 100+ days
DO NOT BUY THE 4-Cyl engine model, repeat DO NOT BUY the 4-cly engine way to under powered for the vehicle weight.
Sometimes the vehicle starts funny???<br><br>
