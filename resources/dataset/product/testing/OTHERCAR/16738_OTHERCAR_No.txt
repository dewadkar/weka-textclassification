            I really wanted a digital camera, mostly so I could upload pictures to my site as quickly as possible.  But, I didn't have much money, and could really only afford something under $100, so I went with the Mustek VDC-3500.  It is an extremely limited camera: no zoom capability, and no way to view images until you upload them.  The memory card it comes with will let you store 8 &quot;fine&quot; images and 26 &quot;standard&quot; images.  I've found that the flash works really strangely--most images come out too dark, unless you're very close to something, and then it's too bright.  Also, it uses up batteries like you wouldn't believe--I would definitely recommend getting rechargeable batteries if you get this camera.  The pictures it takes are okay, but don't expect to be able to get beautiful artistic shots with this camera.  It's best to think of this camera as similar to those disposable cameras you can buy at the drugstore--you get the same quality images and the same distance and flash limitations.  Overall, it's not a bad camera for really basic (daytime) shots, but if you're wanting to do more with your camera, save up and get something better.<br><br>
