            Looks: Surprisingly the car looked good and still turned heads when it was clean, silver was easy to keep clean. Inside was matching grey cloth.

Performance: This little thing moved. With RWD and a peppy engine I could bake the back tire no problem, espicially in the rain on left corners it was easy to wind up pointing in the wrong direction.

Handeling: The way it came, forget it. You would have to do heavy suspension and tire replacing to make this thing have any sort of respectiful cornering ability. For just driving around town though it was fine, crank up the heat and you might wind up in the ditch, believe me I know first hand.

Fit & Finish: Really good, the dash had all the guages, no idiot lights and the rattles and squeaks were at minimum.

Fuel and Repairs: Fuel gets a c+, and repairs gets a F. This car was a mechanical nightmare. The clutch was buggered somehow and in the year I owned it I replaced it 3 times and some other electrical problems too. Datsun couldnt figure out what was wrong other than to come up with the brilliant deduction of "you need a new clutch, duh!!" those guys were idiots.

Summary: To buy now it would be great as a thrash car or a first car for some kid. I suspose by know they must be giving them away!!
