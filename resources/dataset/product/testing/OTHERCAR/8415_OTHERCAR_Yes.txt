            I work as Editor of a specialized computer magazine and Web site; we have an Olympus D600L in our equipment pool. I have used it several times while covering user conventions and trade shows. 

If you are looking for a camera that will primarily be used to create photographs for use in a glossy magazine or other high-resolution PRINT environment, you need to move on to digital cameras with the highest resolution available. But if your primary need is photos for Web sites, this is a fine choice. 

The Olympus D600L sits well in the hand when shooting pictures -- I find that I adjust to it quickly every time I go on assignment with it. The optics are first-class -- I have never been disappointed with the technical quality of photos taken by this camera. 

Photos are transferred to your PC via a smart card that inserts in a floppy-disk transfer tray. It looks geeky, but works well. This is a true SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera, so it can't display your potential image in real-time on the LCD. Also, real-time display is a HUGE drain on battery life, so it's just as well. 

There are a variety of commands available for reviewing photos in the camera before saving or deleting. The LCD screen is usually good enough for making quick decisions about whether or not a photo should be saved to the PC.
