            When my daughter was born in 1991, the need to have a &quot;safe&quot; car suddenly became a reality.  No more driving my parents' hand-me-down cars, no more little bitty tin cans...I needed a REAL car.  The first car I bought after she was born was a Saturn.  That's another story.  Then my husband and I discovered the wonderful world of SUVs...

After test-driving nearly every kind of SUV that was available in 1994, we settled upon the Isuzu Trooper.  That was 105,000 miles ago.  My Trooper has performed like a real champ.  In 6 years, I have never had to do anything to it except routine maintenance (i.e., oil changes, belts, filters, etc.)  We had the timing belt changed at 60,000 miles as recommended by the manufacturer, and this year I had to replace my alternator (at 95,000 miles).  That's it.

The Trooper has saved my life more than once.  Here in Houston, we have floods.  Driving the Trooper has meant that when other cars were featured on the evening news floating down the freeway, I was safe at home with my kids.  The 4-wheel drive feature is easy to engage and just as easy to disengage, if you know what you are doing.  No slipping and sliding on wet Houston freeways for me!

Gas mileage is as good as one can expect for a car this size and type.  I get about 20 mpg on 87 octane gasoline.  And I don't do a lot of freeway driving, so I'm actually getting better mileage than the manufacturer says I should.

The Trooper is a terrific family car.  I have two children now and the four of us (and all of our junk) fit in quite comfortably for long trips.  I recently took a trip with 3 other teachers (and boy, do they know how to pack a LOT of stuff into their suitcases!), and we were not crowded at all.  

In short, I love my car (can you tell?).  In fact, I plan to drive it till it just won't go anymore, and then buy another one.  If you're in the market for an SUV, you really owe it to yourself to check this one out.<br><br>
