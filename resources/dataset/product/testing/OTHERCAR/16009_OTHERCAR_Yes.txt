            I work for a major car rental firm and have an opinion on just about every car out there.

First of all, there is no practical reason to spend more than $25,000 on a new car.  Except for ego and extremely high performance, you can be sated with a myriad of vehicles under the $25k mark.  Then again, ego and high performance aren't what I consider to be &quot;practical&quot;.  If they are to you, read no further.

The Toyota Camry is the best all-around family sedan sold in America today.  While it isn't perfect, it is clearly superior to everything else on the road for the money.

Positives:  Smooth, super quiet, refined ride.  The four cylinder gives good performance and delivers extraordinary gas mileage.  Ergonomically excellent.  AC vents can be shut off draft-free.  Very comfortable rear accommodations.  Above average base stereo and resale value.  Excellent fit, finish, and mechanical dependability.   

Weaknesses:  Suspension bottoms out over speed bumps.  One piece dash is cheap looking (I've bought an aftermarket wood dash kit for my personal Camry and everyone swears it's a Lexus).  Six cylinder variant can exceed $25k in some markets (but it IS an awesome ride).  Somewhat boring styling although the addition of the chrome trim piece around the grill this year makes a big difference.

This vehicles puts most GM/Ford/Chrysler products to shame with its level of refinement.  Fords and Chryslers suffer from very rough rides and noisy exhausts.  GMs are quiet and feel soft but overly &quot;heavy&quot;.  The Camry feels light yet rides like silk.

If you regularly carry a full car, the soft suspension might not work for you.  In every other respect, including resale and dependability, this is an excellent car.  Usually priced higher than other domestic cars given similar equipment levels, rest assured that the extra bucks are well worth it.  You get what you pay for.  If you finance your purchase, it is only a few dollars more every month.

One last item:  though Toyota will deny it , Camrys manufactured in Japan are indeed of a better build quality than those made in the US.  Japanese models are available in most western states including Hawaii.  

And by the way, this opinion applies to all Camrys built after the 1997 model year (except the comment about the chrome trim piece added for 2001). 

I really want to rate it a 4.5.  The benchmark for others.
