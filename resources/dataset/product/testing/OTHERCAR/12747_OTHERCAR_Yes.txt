            A fine camera for anyone starting out in digital photography. Overall a very good camera. No real flaws to mention, just a couple of things which became irritating after a while:
1. Slow processing of high resolution images;
2. Digital zoom is not what I thought it would be when/before I puchased the camera - Was lead to believe it was something amazing.. It's not.

I now own a FujiFilm FinePix MX4700 after selling the MX2700, and miss the ability to easily focus in poor lighting conditions, and the NiMH batteries of the MX4700 are a real nightmare in comparison to the MX2700. 
In comparison to other cameras (ie. the MX4700) I find the ability to focus in poor lighting conditions quite good. The Lithium Ion battery is a defenite plus. After using NiMH batteries in a Fuji MX4700 for the last couple of months, I miss the quick-charging, and long-lasting Lithium Ion battery. Quality of photos is more of than not, quite excellent in comparison to photos taken by other digital cameras (Sony, Olympus, Kodak) and price-wise, this camera is defenitely worth the pricetag. If you have the USB SmartMedia reader (not supplied with the camera) transfers are up to 40X the speed through the serial port. This is defenitely something you would want if time is important/you take many photos. 
1. Processing (displaying/saving) high resolution images takes quite some time. 2. Digital zoom is not all that great (then again, I don't think too much can be expected without the optical zoom) 3. Serial port access to the images is incredibly slow and with high resolution images can seem to take forever. This also requires that the camera be turned on and tends to use a lot of battery power.
