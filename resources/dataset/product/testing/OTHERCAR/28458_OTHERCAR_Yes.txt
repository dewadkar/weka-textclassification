            We purchased this car after my experience with a 1994 Toyota 4Runner that has been a wonderful vehicle, reliable and efficient. We test drove almost everything in its price class, and while we were impressed with several other vehicles like the Infiniti and Lexus, the place where this car stood out for us was in back seat room. I'm 6'5", and my son is 6'3". As my wife drives this car in a car pool, it had to accommodate several large young people in the back seat. We did not want a mini-van. The Avalon fits the bill perfectly for us. it is completely comfortable in both front and back for passengers and driver.

On long trips to Idaho and BC last summer, it proved its worth. This car was the most comfortable highway car I have ever driven. I passes on hills extremely competently with little "searching" by the automatic transmission. It corners well without any diving, and tracks around curves like a responsive sports car.

The only problem we have had is with the trip computer, which is mounted in a position that takes some getting used to in the middle of the dash just below the window. But Toyota is fixing it now with no probs. I have had an extremely cordial relationship with my dealer, Ron Tonkin of Portland, OR, and cannot understand others complaints about Toyota service.
