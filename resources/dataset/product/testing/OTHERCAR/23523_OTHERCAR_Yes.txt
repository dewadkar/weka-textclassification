            Ladies and gentlemen.. as that little girl from the movie so eloquently said.. &quot;They're here!!!&quot;

Yes, Europe's secret has arrived in the US and has blown the doors, as well as the fenders, windshield, muffler, engine and roof, off the competition. Audi has previously released its A4 sedan in the US, and as we all know, it handles like a dream, and for all its sedan looks, packs a powerhouse that more than makes up for its meek exterior. Well, the S4 takes this a step further, replacing the A4's 4 cylinder, with a larger, meaner and more reliable V6!!!

From experience, the S4 corners like it's on rails, accelerates like a rocket, and still comfortably seats 4, and does it all without spilling the Coke nestled between your legs at 85 miles/hr. The price, as usual, is not for your average daily driver, but for those considering a sedan, and who have the money, look no further!!!!<br><br>
