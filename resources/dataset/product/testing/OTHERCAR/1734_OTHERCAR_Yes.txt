            I replaced my 97 Altima ( 210,000 miles) for a 97 Volvo 850, this was 8 months ago and I do not regret the decision. 
The Volvo 850 is a nice looking car doesn&#146t have an average look, and is very well built. I like traveling and in less than a year I have gone from New Orleans to New York twice ( 2,200 miles round trip).
I have done some maintenance such as tune up, alignment, timing belt ( very important), transmission fluid and oil changes. 

One thing that perhaps could be better on the 850  is that it is a little harsh on bumps. I have read that it could be due to the small chassis that doesn&#146t respond well to the weight of the vehicle. I have tried to improve the ride  by lowering the pressure on my Micheline tires and it has helped a little. So be aware it doesn&#146t have the softness of an Oldsmobile or Cadillac.
Another thing, some small things in the car do tend to fail with time. It is nothing serious but for instance, the odometer stopped working it cost me $65 ( installation and removal done by me) to fix it ( dealer wanted $350.00), then the other day the whole instrument cluster failed due to a problem on the &#147electrical component of the ignition switch&#148 part cost $50.00 took me 25 minutes to install it.  
Mechanically, it is excellent no problems at the time, I do a lot of driving and so far it has been a warrior.  
Power? Yes, the average nothing impressive, but I have read that the Turbo models of the 850 Volvo have way more HP and respond as a sport car.

I am a college student working with a tight budget, Volvo parts and repairs can be very expensive if taken to the dealer, but for most some repairs can be done by oneself, and others can be take to your local garage of your trust saving you big $$$$
There are many resources online with step by step instructions of how to, as well as boards and chats where you can ask for advice regarding your vehicle, in my case the Volvo. 
This is an excellent example of it :     http://volvospeed.com/bay13.htm
