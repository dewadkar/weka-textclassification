            I recently purchased a 2002 Bravada in January '02 after driving the Chevy Blazer for the last 3 years.  I was greatly surprised by the vehicle.  I never thought of Olds as having an SUV for me.  When I began my search I had a list of items which I wanted and those which I would be willing to give up.  The sunroof - out, the heated leather seats - in.  Because of the change with the Chevy Blazer to the new TrailBlazer, finding the features I had to have became a chore.  One of the key items with the Blazer before, was how I felt when I was behind the wheel, like it fit.  With the new TrailBlazer, that was no longer the feeling.  Thus the search continued.  

That's how I stumbled across the Bravada.  It has all the features on my "in" list, and the feeling behind the wheel is what I was looking for, and then some.  I studied the owner's manual for days learning about all the preset items that would fit for me, and for driver #2, if there was one.  The controls on the steering wheel are a major plus.  The ride - wonderful.  No longer the stiff feel like other SUV's.  I think the Jeep Cherokee is the worse in this category.  It is a pleasure to drive on the highway.

Living in the Northwest, skiing is a sport which is right at hand and the first trip for my new AWD Bravada.  I was anxious to see how it handled on snow covered roads.  It was a matter of trust since there were no buttons to push no knobs to turn.  Just the understanding that the power was there when you need it.  It passed the test, no problem.

Once back from the mountains, time to wash the road grime off and start the work week.  Low and behold, the problem.  My vehicle is Indigo Blue, and when washing it, I discovered white marks from the back of the front wheel, along the bottom of the door panels, back to the flanged area in front of the back wheel.  It was damaged from the sand and cinders on the snow covered roads.  Looks like the clear coat has been chipped off.  With this being the first trip to the mountains, I can't imagine what the vehicle will look like in a year or so.  I was still on the highway, what would a dirt road do.  I'm working with my dealer to resolve this, however I have not had a satisfying resolution yet.  GM has agreed to repaint, however, they have not agreed to fix the problem.  Looks like running boards or mudflaps are needed to prevent this from happening and they don't even have those on the market yet for this vehicle.  Big Bummer.

All in all, I love my new vehicle.  I hope GM makes the situation right for me so that I don't start this relationship on a sour note.
