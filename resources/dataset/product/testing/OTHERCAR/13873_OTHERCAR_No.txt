            It seems that people either love this car or hate it.  I have a used '87 excel.  I know what your thinking &quot;NINETEEN eighty seven?!?&quot;  But this brings up one of my main points.  This car is 13 years old and only has 63,000 miles on it.  Now you may say to yourself &quot;self, thats not many miles for such an old car&quot;  and right you would be.

Now, to get to my opinion of it.  I won't totally trash it, just because it never quits on me and always gets me where i have to go.  Enough with its good points though.  Currently, on my four door Excel, only two windows roll down, and only three locks work.  I can get the fourth one up, but i have to roll down the window and pull it from the outside (fortunately, this is one of the windows that DO work.)  

Another problem i have is oil.   This car burns oil like its going out of style.  I have to add a quart every 200 miles.  at that rate i don't even know why i bother changing the oil, it's always new oil anyhow!
The engine....oooh the engine.   The cute little 4-cylander 1.5 liter engine.   I can do 0-60 in about 2 minutes, assuming i'm the only one in the car, i take the spare tire out, and i'm going downhill.  Uphill forget it.  I've actually slid backwards down a hill in 1st gear in perfect weather.  i left rubber marks on the road.  fortunately i thought quickly and had my freinds jump out and push me up.  

It is a good bang for your buck, and it is reliable, but if your the type of person who likes a worry-free car (which fortunately i am not) The Hyundai Excel may not be your best choice.  Although, i'm not sure how they are recently.  Keep in mind mines an '87.  But my cousin and good freind has a 92 i believe, and it has had transmission problems repeatedly, and the water-pump sprocket just up and popped off one day.
