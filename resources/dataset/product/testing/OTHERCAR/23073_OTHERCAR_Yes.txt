            I just love my Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640 Digital Camera.  I believe it is one of the best Christmas gifts my husband has given me, since my Computer.  I have had it for 3 weeks and my family and I have had a great time with it.  The best fun is when I discover the self-timer and figure out how to use it.  Watch out everyone now the fun begins.  All you have to do is check on the self-timer then aim and fine your pose then click on the shutter button, go and get into the picture &amp; about 20 seconds it takes the picture. I love it.
I also have had to call tech support and have found them to be very helpful and friendly.
I have recommended this camera to every one for the price its great.
I have place my pictures on my computer.  The directions were so easy to follow.  The camera is very light weight too. Even my 11 year old can use it.<br><br>
