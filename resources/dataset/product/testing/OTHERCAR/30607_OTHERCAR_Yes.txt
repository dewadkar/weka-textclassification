            I bought  this particular car when I was still 15, it was my long awaited first car.. I saved up 2750$, my parents agreed to meet with another 2750$, since I was buying it from its owner, it had been used, was paid off, and they wanted 5500 for it, I thought for a saturn thats good.

Well, soon came along a pool of problems that to this day, new ones are discovered.  Nothing ultimately critical though seeing as how it gets me where im going.

Its original year is 1991, now 2000, Ive put in over 2500$ to fix things.  The most expensive being the a/c because in saturns, they are terribly hard to repair.  So said the saturn dealer i guess.  ANyways.. I do complain a lot, my most recent upset is the automated seatbelts not actually moving, just getting stuck halfway en route.  The only concern with that is just cleaning out its track and oiling it up.. It only does this when its cold, which in Ohio, my poor car has suffered many a brutal winters.  A few years ago, I had a real scary moment, where I learned and will now teach you, the prospective buyer, this particular car does nOT handle slippery roads.  I slid into someones yard going around a corner when there was hardly a slice of ice on the road.  And even now driving over snow covered roads, the back end does have a tendency to sway around corners. 
Safety wise, its perfect, it is made out of type of plastic material as opposed to the usual metal you find in most cars.  That way, it crunches a lot less =) plus, those pesky seatbelts certainly arent putting theirself in harms way to save your butt so the outside is the best thing to rely on.
It still goes, even at 108,000 ,miles, regardless of interference from the few problems that a 10 year old car will endure. It has seemed like a ton of problems thus far, but for the most part, I was able to fix them myself (well with the help of more car-knowledgable people) and at a decently low price..Dont always have to run it to the shop.
Saturn is a quality brand. And I bet Im jinxing my cars quality now that I wrote this.<br><br>
