            If you are happy in going from point a to point b, and don't really care about comfort, options or style, then this is the car for you! I purchased this car from my mother for $3000 last year (not a bad price considering it only had 35,000 miles on it).  I've had two cars previously (1987 chevy cavalier & 1992 chevy lumina) and I wish I had either of those cars now. The Spirit has pretty good acceleration and lots of room. But the exterior/interior style could have been styled better by a 10 year old. The seats are not comfortable and I practically kill someone everytime I try to change the radio station. The suspension & 'fun factor' on this car are almost non exsistent.  However, this car does have it's bright spots.  It is a very reliable car and has decent options (although only one cup holder!). This would be a great first car or cheaper used car.
