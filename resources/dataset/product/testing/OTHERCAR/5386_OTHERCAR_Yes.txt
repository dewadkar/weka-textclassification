            Hi,

I have read several opinions that stated they were dissatisfied with their Dodge Dakota Club Cab PU's.  I've got to tell you that I am the HAPPIEST I have ever been with a new vehicle I purchased.

Throughout the years I have purchased a new vehicle every 3 years.  I always bought high performance vehicles such as Trans-Am's, Z-28's, Mustangs, Chevelle SS's, Dodge Chargers, etc.  There was no way in the world you were EVER going to talk me into buying a PU.  Absolutely NOT!  I wanted my sports cars.  Never once did I buy one of the above vehicles without having major problems with them the first year I had them.  In and out of the shop constantly.  Yet, these were the types of vehicles I kept purchasing.

When I met my fiancee it was time to purchase my next vehicle.  He wanted me to get a PU.  Of course, I quickly shot that idea down and instead purchased a Trans-Am.  Once again, another batch of problems.  3 years later, time to buy another new car.  This time I purchased a Z-28.  Yes... another set of problems, a new transfer case, a whole new set of brakes, new fog lights, new distributor, and much, much more.

Then in 1998 it was time for another car.  We searched for just the right Trans-Am.  Yes... I'm a glutton for punishment.  ;)  My honey pushed and pushed and pushed for me to look at PU's.  I refused for the longest time, but finally he wore me down.  I told him I would look, but I was NOT going to buy.  He could have any rig he wanted, but I was having my Trans-Am.

We looked at Fords and I did not like them.  We looked at Chevys and again I didn't like them.  Then we landed at the Dodge Dealership.  They had a huge several acre lot of brand new Dodges that just came off the car carrier.  We walked around and looked at them all.  I finally had to admit that I really liked the looks of this pretty bright red 1998 Dodge Dakota 4X4 Club Cab PU.  Between my honey and the sales person I agreed to take a test drive though I KNEW that I was not going to buy it.

I test drove the 318 V-8 one first.  I was surprised at how much get up and go it had.  I then decided I would try the 6 cylinder next.  What a DOG!  There was no way I was going to buy that one.  I wanted my power!

When I was done the salesman was of course ready to go in and sign the papers so I could buy it.  I was NOT!  The salesman left at my request and we sat in the car and discussed purchasing the PU for the longest time.  Finally I agreed to buy it as long as I could get it for the payments I wanted and with the agreement that if I regretted it that he would NEVER again but me about buying a PU.  I was really afraid that I was making one big mistake and I would regret the day I bought it.

That has been 18 months ago and I have NEVER even ONCE had this truck in the shop.  I honestly have to say I can't believe it.  Good grief every other car I purchased was in the shop within the first month.  I keep expecting something, anything to go wrong with it, but it hasn't.  I have even put more miles on this truck the first year I had it than I have any other vehicle I have purchased and still not once solitary thing has gone wrong with it.

I truly am very impressed with this truck and would highly recommend it to anyone out there.  I think you will be impressed with it's workmanship, reliability and how much it can haul.  We built a deck last summer and hauled [25] 12' 2x6's, numerous 8' 4x4's, as well as 2x4's and other assorted lumber and building materials.  Granted we only had to go about a mile, but the truck handled the weight pretty nicely.  We couldn't have put any more on there or we would have messed up the tail gate, but I was amazed at how much weight it could handle.

The one thing that I don't like about it much is the gas mileage.  It really doesn't get that good of mileage.  My Z-28 got way better mileage on the freeway.  The Dodge gets around 19-21mpg and in town it gets 14-16mpg.  It's about the same in town as the Z-28, but on the freeway it's a lot less.  We added a toneau cover to it, nerf bars, bed liner and a brush guard to snazz it up a bit.  That was not the cheapest in the world to do, but you might want to consider it.  The toneau cover helped with the gas mileage, bringing it up about 1-2 more mpg.

Personally, I have to say you can't go wrong with this rig!<br><br>
