            When you think Volvo, you think more of safety, rather than good looks.  Ever seen a cool looking Volvo? No.  That is until you see the S40.

<b>Features</b>
The design of the S40 is revolutionary. Volvo has done away with the boxy design it is best known for, and replaced it with a curvy, sporty design that is sure to turn heads.  The S40 looks more like a Mitsubishi; in fact, they are manufactured in cooperation with them.  The S40 not just looks good, but also handles good. It is able to tackle the most demanding ice slick and snow covered roads without causing you to slip off the highway, rollover, and die (Disclaimer: your situation may be different; you may in fact slip off the highway, rollover, and die).


<b>Safety</b>
However, Volvos do not sell themselves on good looks alone, itï¿½s safety that matters. Volvos come standard with ABS brakes, front and rear airbags, airbags in the doors, and also their famous passenger rollover cage to protect the occupants should the car ever flip over on its roof.  It is no wonder Volvos are highly regarded by Consumer Reports for its safety features, and safety track record.  

Because airbags can actually harm a child if they are not seated properly, or are facing the wrong direction in a car, Volvo has built in a state of the art airbag system. The six-airbag system takes into consideration the weight of the passenger, and their location in the car; a computer takes care of the calculations.  Airbags can inflate at full speed in the most severe of accidents, but in less deadly crashes, they inflate more slowly. Volvos also come with an integrated child safety seat, but some may want not to opt for this.


<b>Test Driving</b>
This car truly handles like a dream. On slick icy roads, the car responds quickly to hold onto tight corners, and it is a wonderful feeling to know that you will not be skidding off the highway that night.  On straight roads, however, the steering seems a bit heavy. The Volvo S40 features a turbocharged 5-speed, 1.9Liter four-cylinder engine that produces up to 160Hp.  It is not a V6, but it is almost one. The mileage we get out of the S40 is also excellent, at around 27mpg. The fuel tank holds 16 gallons.  What is fantastic about the S40 is the amount of noise it produces, surprisingly little!  


<b>etc.</b>
Some optional packages of interest include the Volvo cold weather package.  They include heated seats, wipers for the headlamps, and traction control.  when you live in a snowy/sleet/ice slick environment, all wheel traction control is very useful.
