            First let me say I bought this car for my wife.  I think it is a &quot;Chicks&quot; car and it performs like a &quot;chicks&quot; car.  It is really nice to look at though.  I mean really nice.  Have you ever bought a new car and look at it as you get out of it and walk away.  I am doing it constantly.  It is simply beautiful to look at.

  It handles really nice.  It might be just a little tight in the steering.  I haven't found anything I really don't like about it except that when I get to a certain RPM the gas pedal will mildly vibrate. 

 I bought the 4 cylinder because it gets good gas mileage and I don't think my wife cared what kind of performance it got.  Just as long as it is a pretty red car.  The four cylinder has no power, don't buy a 4 cylinder for speed or get up and go. 

 The interior is a little cheap to look at, but for 16,995 (and lucky me $3000 off) you can't beat it.  So if you want to look good in a nice looking car buy the 4 cylinder.  If you want to look good in a nice looking car that has a little get up and go- get the V6.<br><br>
