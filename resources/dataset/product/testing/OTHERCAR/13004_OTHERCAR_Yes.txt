            The Canon A60 is a great 2 megapixel, entry level digital camera, for those who want extensive control of the camera functions. This is a very good camera for a first move into experiencing digital photography (my first step).

The LCD viewfinder to some getting used to when you are more familiar with an SLR style 35 mm camera. Although you quickly get over the challenge. The viewfinder can be rendered virtually useless in bright daylight situations. When relying upon the optical viewfinder, the view area loses about 20% of the picture. You have to try to compensate your composition by estimating the balance of the image area. The parallax displacement also affected the composition with images being centred differently when referenced to the LCD playback of the actually captured image. 

The exposure controls in the automatic modes have many very functional and supportive features. The DIGIC processor controls the automatic white balance, auto focus, power management etc. This feature proved to work flawlessly for my point and shoot efforts on a recent vacation. Exposures were consistently well balanced in all but the most demanding exposure situations. The iSAPS portion of the system seemed to aid in this consistency. This all functions seemlessly and behind the scenes. There are three different metering modes for those who prefer to select between evaluative, centre weighted and spot metering. This can be handy in very trick lighting situations. The aperture range on the lens is from f2.8 to f8 and shutter speeds range from 15 to 1/2000 second. 

The camera control for exposure adjustment is a dial on top of the camera. This allows you to set all of these features with a simple turn of the dial. The controls available are full manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, program mode, full auto, portrait, landscape, night portrait with flash, sports, delayed shutter, panoramic, and movie. The movie setting won't replace a video camera, but in a pinch, the feature can be useful. The panoramic feature of the camera works well with the software provided. This is a great tool for vacation slide shows, as the panoramic mode provides a very good sense of being there. Personally, I love this feature.

Other functionality is provided using the buttons on the back of the camera, while viewing the selection options on the LCD viewfinder. You can quickly adjust the flash options of flash, red eye reduction, no flash. There is a button for macro photography that also allows for manual focus. The function button allows you to select the exposure setting for over/under exposure control, in order to compensate for certain lighting situations. White balance controls for different lighting situations such as daylight, tungsten etc. There is an ISO setting range of 50 to 400 asa film equivalent sensitivity. Image effects such as vivid, neutral, low sharpness, sepia and black and white, as well as the image resolution (1600 X 1200, 1024 X 768, 640 X 480) can be selected. 

Overall, the controls are set far enough apart and are large enough that most hands will have little trouble using them. 

I wasn't overly impressed by the flash functionality. It was barely useable at 15 feet and serves better illumination from 6 to 12 feet. The red eye reduction was pretty much useless. I don't even bother with it as I have to do the red eye touch ups in my computer anyway. 
 
Another area that needs improvement is the shutter lag. There are occasions where you really want that instant picture mode and the performance just isn't there for this kind of demand. If you know you need that kind of camera reaction, stick to your film camera for those occasions.  

The camera is powered by 4 AA batteries. In field use, I got about 200 shots out of one set of batteries with extensive use of flash. Expect more out of the NMh battery option. On a ten day trip, I used 2 sets of batteries. I thought this was very good considering the film and processing costs that I didn't have to incur.

There are some very useful options that are worth considering. Both a wide angle and 2X tele-converter, a close up lens, water proof case, ac adapter and NMh batteries and charger. The water proof case would be great for snorkelers. 

In conclusion, I'm very pleased with the lens and image quality. Images that weren't up to standard were easily adjusted in the supplied computer software. Although photo shop would be a better choice. This is a great camera for point and shoot. Yet those that want to do more serious work won't be left out. Unless you really need the extra resolution of a more expensive camera, this is a good choice. A flash extension for external flash would be a very welcome feature.
