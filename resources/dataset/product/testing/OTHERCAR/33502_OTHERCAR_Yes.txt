            Here we have a digital camera in the low retail price of $149 that can be found for under $130 if you shop around.

This is not for those looking for professional quality digital photos, it does produce some good quality in 640 x 480 but it is not excellent in quality.

<b>Photos!</b>
The camera uses 1.3 Megapixils to give you a resolution of 640 x 480 that will give you about 120 photos on the 8MB SmartMedia card that comes with it.

You can also take photos in 320 x 240 and get about 240 photos on the 8MB SmartMedia card.

Software is provided to bring your 640 x 480 photos up to a 1280 x 960 resolution but every time I bring them to that scale the quality goes down.

<b>Movies!</b>
There are two movie settings 320 x 240 pixels and 160 x 120 pixels at 15 fps. (Frames Per Second)

The result in both resolutions is not bad though the 160 x 120 is rather small.

Now in the Web Cam feature it gives you a nice 640 x 480 resolution with 30 fps.

<b> QuickSync </b>
Logitech gives you a simple and easy way to load your photos on to your computer. 

1.	Plug the USB cable on the camera and the computer.
2.	Press the QuickSync button on the camera.
3.	That�s it, simple and easy!

A Swivel Base
One 8MB SmartMedia Card

<b>The Good points!</b>
The camera looks like no other with a design of its own that seems to be built very rugged in case it was to be dropped.

Takes Still Photos and Movies with a built in microphone. 

Having a removable SmartMedia Card is a plus since you can upgrade and get a larger card for more storage.

Plenty of software included

A delay of a few seconds between taking the next photo

<b>Overall!</b>
For a digital camera under $150 it does offer a lot with still photos, movies and Web Cam. This is a plain point and shoot camera that you use a viewfinder to take you photos with.

The camera seems to be built rather rugged and will take more punishment then those several hundred dollar cameras. The camera holds pretty good in my big hands and the buttons that control the camera are all at fairly good locations.

The photo quality is pretty fair in the 640 x 480 photos and when you use the software to enlarge them they lose a lot of quality. The movie quality is also not to bad, I didn�t try the Web Cam that is also available.

The uses for a camera can be for the �Fun� of it, this is also an inexpensive way to get your children into the learning process of digital photography. 

Would I buy one? No! I prefer to spend several hundred dollars on a digital camera that fits my needs. 

Would I recommend it? Well Yes if that is all you can afford, it does produce pretty good quality, just not great and they are too small. If you are wanting it for printing 8 x 10 quality photos then you better shop around in the 3 Megapixils range or larger.
