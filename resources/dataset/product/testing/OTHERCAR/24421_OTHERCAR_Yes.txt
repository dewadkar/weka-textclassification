            I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSC-S50 after careful review of other products. I was looking for a camera that was small enough to carry around. I also wanted certain conveniences, like being able to view my pictures right away. The USB cable is great for that, but, even better is the memory stick. You see, I have a laptop that accommodates the memory stick. After taking pictures with the cybershot, I take the memory stick out, slip it into my laptop, and can see my pictures right away. The photo quality is excellent, and the camera is easy to use.

Aside from still pictures, you can record short MPEG video. This is great for sending a &quot;live&quot; greeting via email to grandma or aunts and uncles from the kids. 

One thing I don't like about this camera is that there is no viewfinder. Although it really isn't necessary when taking pictures, and you actually get a better perspective of the shot when looking at the LCD screen, I keep trying to put my eye by the non-existent viewfinder out of habit. 

The Cybershot comes with software so that you can touch up the pictures and do a variety of things with them. Nothing too spectacular about it, I happen to like the Kodak Picture Easy software better. It's much more user friendly, allowing for some creativity. The other thing I'd like to mention is that Sony sends you a 4MB memory stick which is virtually useless, especially if you want to use it for MPEG video. I purchased a 64MB.

The camera comes with a rechargeable lithium battery, so you don't have to worry about running out to get those AA's. Battery life seems to be good--I haven't run into any trouble.

When I first purchased the Sony, my first impression of the casing was that it was cheap. It's very light before you put the battery in, and it felt like cheap plastic, however, the camera is solidly made. I guess you sacrifice a little when making something light and small.

All in all, I think this is an excellent camera for the price, with some additional features you don't get in other costlier cameras. <br><br>
