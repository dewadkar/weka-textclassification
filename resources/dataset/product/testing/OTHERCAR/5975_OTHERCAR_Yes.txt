            The 240 was a very basic, no frills model-- but that's part of the attraction for ascetics.  We purchased a four cylinder 1991 with 73,000 miles in 1997.  Now it has 133,000 miles.

It has served as my daily workhorse commuter car and still does.  I don't worry about keeping the interior tidy, though I certainly take clients out in something else.

The body of the car is 1960s and boxy but distinctive.  I love the appearance, but that is a very personal taste.  I like retro, and this car feels retro.

There are no status issues in keeping this car for many years.  It is a Volvo; keeping a Volvo does not mean you are not doing well.

It rides and sounds heavy, and accelerates slowly, but once it gets going, it is quite nimble.  I attribute this in part to its narrowness and its tight turning radius. 

The interior is comfortable and supportive owing to big seats, but lacks the kind of appointments you might expect in a luxury car.  The stereo and cassette player are of decent quality, but the speakers are powerless and tinny and are blown easily.  The glove box is tiny.  There are some convenient pockets in the front doors but none in the backs of the seats.

The back seat folds down logically to create a nice big flat bed for garage sale purchases.  Too bad they reduced the size of this bed in the 850 (or we might have bought an 850 as a replacement).  The roof rack is sturdy.

With four Yokohama Guardex 600 dedicated snow tires, the car has been simply excellent in the snow and ice.  It has never gotten stuck in ski country.  Many people, including apparently at least one of the other reviewers, make the mistake of failing to purchase good snows and wrongly accuse the 240 for their poor traction.

The body of the car has held up extraordinarily well.  There is not a spot of rust.  The engine has also held up well, with oil changes every 3000 miles.  It starts, regardless of the weather.

The engine takes premium gas, and is reasonably efficient, but not cheap to operate.

However, there have been many electrical issues of the annoying variety.  Friction of doors and other parts has damaged wires, requiring labor.  Water has permeated various areas and damaged wiring.  Water has intruded into the rear light fixture area, requiring almost continuous replacement of bulbs.

Even without rust, there have been leaks permitting water intrusion all over the interior of the car.  They have been diagnosed and plugged, but I keep the car pointed downhill because that truly seems to keep the water out.

There have been expensive repairs of other items which are tangential to the car's operation but unfortunately necessary nonetheless.  For example, the safety on the gear shift lever failed, requiring a $500 replacement.  This device prevents one from moving out of "Park" for safety* reasons, but when it fails the car won't move.

Resale value does stay high, but for a 1991 with 140,000 or more miles I would be careful.  Parts are very expensive and the problems with these models are hard for the cheaper corner-type mechanics to diagnose.  Volvo dealer service departments are excellent but expensive.

In sum, I do very much like the car despite all of its difficulties and its nasty habit of emptying the bank account once or twice a year.  I'm in no hurry to get rid of it, though for fun I choose another car to drive.

*Unless it is in Park (and not only in Neutral), this Volvo easily rolls, whether the engine is on or off.  Digression story:  The previous owner had disabled the broken safety feature (as some mechanics and other owners have suggested that we should be doing).  One day I opened the back passenger door to get the groceries.   Our precocious then- two year old, to my surprise, scrambled over the seat, got behind the steering wheel and, duplicating our actions, moved the gearshift from Park.  The car rolled down our steep driveway as I lept back into the front and reached with my hands for the brake.  The engine being off, the brakes were too stiff for this action to do anything but slow the car.  We ended up with the rear wheels in the neighbor's lawn.  As I got up and observed this situation, the neighbor's Town and Country loomed ominously over the side.  As I got out, I saw a long thin streak extending from left front fender to left rear fender.  Looking more closely, I observed that it was from the rubber on the Town and Country's bumper.  It came off with a bit of moisture; no damage done.
