             The Oldsmobile 88 royal was the first car I purchased after college. It was affordable, had a spacious interior,  plenty of power and good acceleration despite its size. The vehicle was also surprisingly economical/fuel efficient and dependable. It featured front wheel drive, a 3.8 liter v6 with efi. My Olds was equipped with ac/pb/ps/am fm cassette, rear window defogger, tilt steering and wiper delay as factory options. The baseline velour interior is a bit Spartan yet tastefully done with large 60/40 super soft bench seats, vinyl covered dash and velour door panels. The gage cluster was easily read in normal daylight or at night thanks to a large well lighted 85 mph analog speedometer, large analogue fuel gauge and off center to the passengers side placed temp, amp and oil dummy lights. The stereo tape deck featured auto reverse and a rich sounding 4 speaker sound system which consisted of 2 5'' coaxial speakers in front and 2 5''x7'' coaxial speakers in the rear deck.
Known problems and/or defects:  Oldsmobile tested and produced a molded plastic intake manifold on the 88 series in 1991 which were prone to warping, that equaled anti freeze leaks, vacuum leaks and an assortment of other problems. Luckily mine was cast iron, which to the best of my knowledge most are either cast iron or aluminum. 
The quad valve modulator often fails, the heater core/ac often clogs because of poor positioning, check engine light is a common occurrence if the car goes over 100,000 miles, crank trigger is poorly designed, plastic radiator drain commonly develops leaks/fails as a result of poor gm design,window crank mechanism poorly designed again as a result of poor gm design, rear window defogger commonly cracks and ceases to function.
A list of other pluses besides those listed: The engine never "used" any oil nor did the transmission "use" any or leak any fluid. It is common for these cars to exceed 150,000 miles and some are know to reach 250,000 miles with normal maintenance. The base coat clear coat paint was very durable considering this vehicle was produced within the  time period when many automobile manufactures were experimenting with water based "environmentally safe" paints that commonly peeled off result in in sever oxidation and eventual rot/rust.
