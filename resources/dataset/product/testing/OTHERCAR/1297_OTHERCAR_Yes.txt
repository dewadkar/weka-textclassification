            I bought my 4Runner is 1997. Mine is light brown, with leather interior. The reason I bought this car was because I loved the way the 4Runner looked. Its just a beautiful car, and very affordable. The car has pretty good acceleration. The drive is also somewhat smooth. It's very spacious in the front and the back. The sound system is also really great. I have a three disc CD Changer in my 4Runner, and let me tell you it is awesome. You'll have the option to have one in your 4Runner should you choose to get one. The speakers in the car are great also. The car has a great breaking system. Another feature I have in mine is that I have four cup holders. Me mentioning that may sound pretty stupid but having cup holders in your car is awesome, and let me tell you the 4Runner is fully loaded with them. Another great aspect of the car is that it is reliable. There hasn't been a single instance where the car has not started or stalled out. Lastly one great money saving aspect of this car is that it doesn't eat up to much gas, so that you'll save you trips to the gas station. One drawback to this car, maybe the fact that it isn't the safest in the world. You feel some bumps while driving. So sometimes it isn't a smooth ride. I recommend this car to anyone who is planing to buy a S.U.V., that doesn't care is they feel a bump or two. Also anyone that wants to buy an affordable but good looking S.U.V. I'm sure you can get this car for under $30,000. <br><br>
