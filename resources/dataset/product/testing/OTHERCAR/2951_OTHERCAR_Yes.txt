            Handling on the Integra GS-R is quick with acceleration excellent in the lower gears. Unfortunately things begin to peak out in moving from 90-125, but this is a minor quibble. With the rear-spoiler standard in GS-R, handling is great at high speeds, and you'll feel like you are driving a BMW when taking corners.

The V-tec engine is not only high performance, but is also fairly conservative on gas as well, an 11 gallon tank usually carries me 290 miles with mixed highway/city driving. Unfortunately engine noise is a slight problem on the highway, and the stereo system could be much better in order to create a better driving experience.

While the driver bucket seats are very comfortable, I've been told that the rear seats are a harsh stiff ride. This is a nice tradeoff for me (as a driver) since the rear seat folds completely down giving me storage space similar to that of a station wagon.

Neat features such as cruise control on the steering wheel, as well as automatic adjustable mirrors makes me feel as if I'm driving in a car which is much more expensive.

The GS-R comes with very few options/packages, it represents (the 97  model) the top of the line in Integras (recently the Type R for sports fan can arguably claim this title), with standard features that are an option in most other coupes.

The best thing about buying an Integra is that the car is from Acura.
Great, consistent customer service when I bring the car in for tune-ups, and the one time something went wrong (something with the gear box between 4th and 5th gear was causing grinding at 30k miles) they fixed it in 3 days and lent me a loaner car of the same model type.
