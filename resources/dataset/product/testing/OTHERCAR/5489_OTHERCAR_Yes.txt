            The 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX STi... don't you love the sound of that?  Well, sorry buddy... wrong review. :)  My review for this awesome beefy brother of the WRX is here:

<a href="/content_110246989444">http://www.epinions.com/content_110246989444</a>

However, don't count the WRX out just yet!  For $5,000 less, you still get alot for the money, and the proven EJ20 engine, turbocharged to get 227 hp out of a boxter four.

Not much has changed from last year except for some minor interior and exterior styling.  In fact, it performs exactly the same!  Turbo lag is still present when the tach needle is below 2500 RPMs, and only fully kicks in (or at least that I can feel) at around 3000+ RPMs.  The handling is just as wicked as before, and is actually way more predictable and easier to handle than the STI.

But more details here:

<b>Interior</b>
The way the dashboard looks is just like the STI and the RS.  Of course, this is to be expected.  It is slightly redesigned from last year.  Actually, it is so slight, that if you were just test driving the two cars, you may not notice the changes.  However, pay attention to both for the same amount of time, or test drive them both back to back, and you will see small minor differences, such as the shapes, dimensions, etc.  Unlike the STI, you don't get the black-out gauges, the wild racing seats, etc.  The gauges look more like the RS, and is readable when the car is off.  The seats are still nice and supportive, but has a great balance between comfort, holding, and support.  Same can be said about the styling and colors.  You still get the same old MOMO steering wheel from last year, which has an excellent feel, but still look like a stock wheel.  The STI got it right, though. :)

The cup holder (like all Subarus) are located just below the center vents, just above the stereo.  I always hated this placement, but it seems to hold a can of soda just fine.  HAVC controls are easy to operate, and very intuative.  They look and feel like standard fare econo dials and switches for fan speeds and temperature control.

The stereo system is what I have to rave about.  Keep in mind, this is all standard equipment!  You get AM/FM radio with seperate presets, a cassette player, and an in-dash 6-CD changer!  This is one of the most fully featured standard stereo I've ever seen, as cassettes are already being fazed out for CDs, and single-CD players are more the standard.  Subaru may have allowed owners a good reason NOT to go aftermarket.  You also get 6 speakers in a tiny sedan cabin, which allow the sound to be easily fill the area.  The best part is that there is no distortion, and the bass matches the trebble just perfectly without any adjustments (maybe someone played with it before I got in).

The clock is place in a perfect place - the top center of the dashboard. This allows passengers to be able to tell the time, and not bother the busy driver for the time.  And speaking of the back, the rear area is a bit tight for tall people, but the seats themselves seem comfortable for a long ride.  

All in all, the interior is one of the best I have ever seen and felt.  It is not overly racey and "toy-like", and not very boring, either.  It is a striking balance between sporty and comfort.

<b>Exterior</b>
The 2004 Impreza doesn't seem to have changed much from the previous generation. The headlight is now way more attractive, and seem better integrated into the body style. The rear is still just as boring, but this time, it is treated with slightly redesigned tail lights. 

The wheel wells are flared to accommodate the wide 205/55R16 tires and 16" alloy rims. Add to that, a power buldge on the hood (a functional air dam for the top-mounted intercooler), and a slim wing, and you get something it is mean looking, but still no STI.  It looks somewhat like a typical econo sedan, but the power buldge is the only thing that stands out. 

Besides the buldges, the rest of the car looks like a normal econo sedan. Or should I really say, it looks just like an Impreza.

<b>The Ride</b>
Unlike the STI, the WRX is much more easier to keep control than the STI.  This is mostly due to the fact that the engine is "only" pushing 227 hp peaking at 6000 RPMs and 217 lb.-ft of peak torque at 4000 RPMs.  The ride is not as harsh as the STI, but not as supple as the RS.  It is one of those "in betweens" that makes the WRX much more livable than the STI, but still sporty.  Hell, WRX and sporty goes together!

The clutch feels nice and light, and engages as expected without any surprises.  The stick shifter engages very well, too.  The thing goes into gear snickety snick easy, and comfortably.

Mash the accelerator, and in first gear, you can hear the tires chrip just a bit.  And because of the AWD system, there is plenty of traction, it grips real well, and pushes the driver back into the seat.  It doesn't feel as powerful as the STI, especially if you test driven the STI before hand, but is still very satisfying.  The acceleration feel starts to fall of in 4th gear, but the speed will still climb quickly.

Side to side movements shows that the WRX have great composure.  Exhibiting slight understeer in the corners, you can quickly transition to oversteer with more throttle.  And it is much less sensitive to the throttle than the STI, thanks to less power.  Who said more power is a good thing?

So if cornering and autoXing is your thing, the WRX is it.  Rather mangle with the steering wheel much more than the WRX?  STI is it!

<b>Conclusion</b>
As tested, the $26,000 price tag is much easier to swallow than the $31,000 the STI is asking for.  You get the same thrills, and a full stereo system.  For just under 30k, the Lan Evo might be your thing.  The STI?  Just for someone who wants a track car and WANT to be punished with brutal power.

Two thumbs up, with my right foot down!
