            I own a 1994 Jetta GLX with now currently 75,000 miles on it and I have to say it has been just a dream for me with, all things considered, very minimal problems.

Perhaps I have been luckier than the average person, I don't know, but my Jetta is also only one of the 200 that was made when this body style came out, (not the new one, its predecessor) so it is a little different in that the others have all been made in Mexico.

PROS:
Strong engine (V6 power)
Factory Warranty - 2yrs. 24k miles bumper to bumper, 10 yrs., 100k miles on the engine (how do they do that?)
Extended warranty purchased - 8 yrs, 96k miles (VW Platinum warranty)  Warranty was purchased for ca. $900 and has been worth it.

OK, on to the cons.  As I said, I have had a great car.  That does not mean that nothing has broken on it.  On the contrary, things have.  But, I was also smart enough to buy the extended warranty on this car and that has saved me quite a bit of money over the last 3 yrs.  One power window motor broke (ca. $350 to replace).  Transmission problems - VW rebuilt my transmission for a cost of $1300 - free to me.  DON'T FORGET!!! Manual transmission (like I have) are usually not covered the same way automatics are.  Be careful if this is going to be an issue for you.  One water pump (after my drive from Boston to Miami - straight!) ca. $425.  So, as you can see, the warranty definitely paid for itself.  I also have to admit that I am probably not as nice to my car as other might be.  I have taken my car to driving schools, autocrosses, general days at the track and then similar driving around town.  People usually get weirded out when I wear my helmet going to work in the morning (just kidding).  But honestly, I push my car hard every day and it has been a creampuff considering.

I mean, for the $20,000 I paid for my car, it has a ton of options, including leather, power windows and traction control (yeah, mandatory airbags, etc., etc.).  But you have to remember that in 1994 when I bought this, for instance, traction control was still fairly new.  My father's BMW 740i was I believe the first model to have it from BMW and it was delivered in Jan/Feb of 1995.  So, VW was a little quicker to market (yes I would much rather have the 740 than my Jetta but I don't).  And the new GLX model from Volkswagen (be careful, I haven't actually seen any of these in the US yet, lot's of VR6's, but not the fully loaded GLX) comes with rear sunscreens, rain sensing wipers and a host of other cool amenities.  With a list price of $24,000 (meaning you can buy it for easily $22,000) you really get a lot of car with German engineering and something that will hold up for 100k miles as long as you take normal care of it (checkups, maintenance, oil, radiator, etc.)

So, go buy one, you won't regret it.
