            Well, this is my fifth VW, and this time I opted for the TDI diesel engine.  Our "other" car is a 2000 Beetle 1.8T, and I was worried that the diesel wouldn't have the performance I've come to really enjoy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  You simply have to drive one of these to believe it.  The acceleration is completely acceptable.  While it certainly doesn't have the "greased lightning on roller skates" quality that my TurboBug has, it does have PLENTY of power when you need it.  I've been all over the Houston freeways in it, and it has never left me feeling that I didn't have the "oomph" I needed.   This last tankful I actually got 53 miles per gallon.  This is the God's honest truth, and I can hardly believe it myself, but the numbers don't lie. Heck, this is better than those "hybrid" cars.  Think about that.   If any of you out there are on the fence as to whether or not to purchase the diesel, all I can say is go ahead and take the plunge.  As for the general characteristics of the car, it's got great driving dynamics and is extremely quiet on the freeway, with no wind noise at all, and a velvety ride.
The only downside is that the back seat is tight.  Other reviewers have commented that unless you have midgets for passengers, this car is not for you.  Well, our family of four consists of two adults and two teenagers, all roughly 5'9, and there are no complaints from the rear seat unless the seats are ALL THE WAY BACK.  Even then, everybody fits, there just isn't any wiggle room.  You have to think of the car as a tight, German road car, with intimate interior accomodations.  When you are in the back, you feel as much a part of the car as the driver.  The seats are, however, VERY comfortable--it's just the legroom that's the issue.
By the way, I wanted a Golf for the hatchback utility, but my wife spotted this diesel Galactic Blue Jetta, and that was that.   I was at first apprehensive about not getting my hatchback, but you guys have GOT to see the trunk on this thing.  It's big.   Very big.  I'd swear it has to have a bigger trunk than any other small car around, and to my eye, it is quite a bit bigger than a Taurus or Camry.  The trunk hinge is in the sill also, so no intrusion of space when you close the lid.
In closing, you have to just go take one for a test drive.
You won't believe it, and you'll never be happy with anything else if you are the least bit serious about driving.
As I've said, this is our 5th VW.  Yes, sometimes annoying rattles crop up, little interior items break, and maintenance on schedule is mandatory, as with most Euro-centric cars.  What you can't put into words is how these VW's become family members.  It is weird.  Sort of like having a great big, metal family dog.  Buy any one of these VW's, especially the Jetta or Bug, and it's like you've just adopted a pet from the pound.  You will miss it when you are away from it, and you will exhibit a full manifestation of the VW disease when you notice that you plan to go to work "the long way" so you can drive it "just a little more".
I know that because I'm a big VW fan, many of you out there may think that I'm not being objective. I really am, but these are just great cars.  Go take one for a test drive and see for yourself.
