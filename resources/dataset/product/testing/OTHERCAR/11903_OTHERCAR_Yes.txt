            The Agfa 780 is an excellent digital camera for the price (sub $200 for just the basic camera unit). With a top resolution of 1024x768, it is more than adequate for most uses.  This camera is very easy to learn to use, and is an excellent camera for a school teacher's repertoire--it enables a budding student author to easily &quot;spice up&quot; articles for a school newspaper or yearbook.  For the average person, the camera's 4 levels of compression (from 320x240 pixels and two levels of 640x480 pixels to the level listed above) provides an excellent range of capability for e-mailing to all types of general photographic capabilities.  The only caveat I have to offer is that the included Agfa Photowise software is somewhat difficult to install, and the instructions are not at all clear. One has to be fairly computer literate in order to get it to work properly.  I've been involved with computers for over 20 years, and it took me two days and a fair amount of research in the internet to get it to work properly.  Once installed and configured, though, the software works well and gives the budding electronic photographer a wide range of choices limited only by the imagination.  Regarding the camera, like all electronic cameras, it &quot;eats&quot; batteries for lunch.  I've found that when the battery indicator shows 1/4 power left, removing the batteries and re-installing them in a different order will bring back a lot more life.  It would be a wise idea to purchase rechargeable alkaline batteries and a recharger rather than the optional Agfa power pack--save yourself 50 bucks.  The camera case is pretty weak also, so it would be wise to invest in a good leather or heavy duty nylon case as well.  Over all, I've had a positive experience with this camera and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting into relatively high quality electronic photography at a very reasonable price.<br><br>
