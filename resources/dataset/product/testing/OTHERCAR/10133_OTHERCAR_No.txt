            I recently purchased a 1999.5 Nissan Pathfinder. I love the way it drives,
handles, and performs.  This is the first time however, that I have had such &quot;buyers remorse&quot; when it comes to customer service provided by
&quot;Team&quot; Nissan! It seems that they know they have an outstanding product, so they can afford to let customer service go &quot;down the drain&quot;. Besides the facts of the truck not being cleaned and prepared for pick up, having a cut in the rear tire cover, that they replaced after 2 months,&quot;did me a favor.&quot;yeah right!, and this last episode of my second car key. Apparently, they could not &quot;find&quot; the second key, so they had a second one made, This new truck has a &quot;security chip&quot; in the key itself, that the dealership seemed to overlook when they made me the &quot;second&quot; key. I recently wanted to add a remote car starter to my truck, and to my dismay, when I left my home, I used that &quot;second key&quot; because the first key (that works well) was on my key chain that I'd need for the rest of the day. 10 minutes into driving, the truck shuts off! it's a &quot;security shut down&quot;. since the second key had no chip in it. I won't even get into that inconveniencing situation with the tow truck, or how I couldn't even get the starter installed with only one key! But when I called the dealership, not even an apology! Just a &quot;you'll have to call service in the morning!&quot; I love my truck, but their slogan should be &quot;Driven..MAD!&quot;<br><br>
