            Let's start with digital versus 35mm film cameras:  Digital cameras will
not give the clarity and depth of color of a photographic image.  Film
paper is something like 2500 dots per inch of color where 600 dots per 
inch is the best you'll get on paper and 80-100 dots per inch is what you get with a computer display.  Digital generally does not match 35 mm.

OK.  This camera gives 640X480 display which is great for commercial, fun,
putting stuff on the computer, the internet or if someone wants reasonable
images. 

I used this camera out in the field and probably shot 20,000 pictures and dropped it 10 or 12 times in the dirt and on the ground before I had to 
get it fixed.  This is not an exaggeration.  My Mavica was a workhorse.

Secondly it is easy to use. Thirdly, you can shoot hundreds of pictures 
before the battery wears down and save them on a floppy.   I like that I
could just stick the floppy in my computer and have ready-to-modify pictures to use.

The down side?  They are expensive but developing is cheap!!!!!!!!<br><br>
