            I have been driving my mom's car ever since she bought it brand new.  And I have got to say that I love it.  IT was okay when I still lived at home but now that I have my own child I love it even more.

It is very easy for my son it get in and out of his car seat with getting snow and slush all over the back seat.  The front seat is also very roomy and the radio is great (for factory) I love that it is loud (for factory).  

This car could use more storage space and be a little bit better on gas but overall it is a good car.

The gas gauge has been broken since we first bought it (factory buy back) and the cup holder also broke early on.  Both of which we don't really need because the gas light still comes on and the cup holder still works you just have to be gentel.<br><br>
