            Good Things
I bought my Subaru Forrester in March of 1998 because I was looking for a dependable, tough vehicle with the added safety and assurance of all-wheel or 4-wheel drive.  My job requires me to report in, no matter what the weather so I needed a vehicle that will always get me there!  I compared the statistics to other similar vehicles - Toyota RAV-4, Honda CRV and in every category - interior space, horsepower, and price, the Subaru came out on top.  It handles like a car and has about the same length dimensions as my previous car - a Chevy Nova, so I can zip in and out of small parking places with ease.  It accelerates smoothly uphill even when loaded with 4 adult passengers.  One other feature that I really like is the fact that the driver-side seat adjusts in about 6-different directions.

Bad Things
The only bad things that I could say about my Forrester is that:
When I bought mine, it was only available in 4 colors.  
The in-dash cupholder obscures the temperature controls and vents somewhat.
The antenna has to be unscrewed and removed for car washing.
That's it.

I've enjoyed this car/SUV from the first day, and I still love it.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a dependable, sporty, and reasonably priced all-wheel drive vehicle.<br><br>
