            John Delorean had the vision to create a new company, and a new car.  The DMC-12 was his vision, and I think it was one of the great cars I've ever seen.  In my life, I have only seen one on the road, and it was painted red.  They are so rare, but they are so neat.

How about some background.  The Delorean cars were built in Ireland, and 1983 was the last year.  The last few thousand were hand built, because the company ran out of money and built the last thousand by hand because they couldn't run the machines.  The last, final Delorean was made out of gold plates left over from the American Express promo.  The company put lots of money into Lotus for desigining it, and that is where it is believed most of the funds went for making the car, as there was a 19 million dollar gap, I think, which is why Delorean tried to sell cocane to save his company.

You may think that parts are impossible to find, but DeLorean of Houston, not affilated with DMC, pretty much as the entire inventory for the world of Delorean parts, and they have lots of stuff.  Unfortunately, the casting dies for the doors and fenders were sold as scrap to a fisherman, and now lay at the bottom of the sea.  Some parts are extinct.  Oh well.

The DeLorean doors are amazing.  They only need 12 inches of run off space to open.  The bars that raise them and lower them are revolutionary, they are cryogenicaly engineered to perfection.  

Outside
This car looks amazing.  You have to imagine in 1981 it must have been revolutionary, because today I still think it looks different from everything.  The stainless steel body panels are a one off.  However, the real eye opener are the doors.  They are engineered to perfection, and open with ease and close with ease.  The wheels are somethin too.  I wish my old civic had wheels like that.
For 1981, i give outside 4/5 stars.

Inside
The Interior of this car is nice, from what I can tell.  The dash is well laid out, and the seats are leather.  From what I can tell, it seems rear visibility would be affected.  It seems like it gives a tight, controled feeling.  Sorry i don't have more on this.
For interior, i give it 4/5

Engine
Dah, for a man that helped create Pontiac performance cars, the output on this car is pathetic.  The car is slow, and for a 30k exotic in 1981 it shoudl have had a V8 at lesat, not a V6.  But oh well.  At least it had a manual, and it still moves faster than my old civic.  THere are turbo kits for it however, to help you move.
3/5

Conclusion
The Delorean is a great car.  The doors are amazing.  Unfortunately, its hard to find one in perfect condition.  They usually go for around 15k now a days, and it seems there are many in Illinois, as this is the state where the most were sold.  Some places also sell rebuilt ones, but at a premium price of 35k!  Parts are accessible, so don't despair.  There are also big followings, where people can help you get the car running.  The car turns lots of heads, so make sure you get some security system.  LoJack would be good.  All in all, if I wasn't driving my Acura, most likely I would have rebuilt a DeLorean.
