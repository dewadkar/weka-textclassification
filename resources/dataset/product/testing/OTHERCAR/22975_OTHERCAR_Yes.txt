            Years ago as a child a polaroid instamatic was the first instant camera I had ever seen.  Later years, I received a Polaroid &quot;one step&quot; instant camera.  These were the best things since sliced bread, or at least I thought they were.  In the modern world of technologly the digital camera is a step above the rest.  Now I know there are more expensive digital cameras on the market but for the cost the Polaroid 640 is an outstanding piece of equipment.

My sister purchased our digital camera as a gift for us last spring.  Within a few minutes we had it working taking pictures all over the house.  The ease of operation is remarkable for a non technical person like myself.  Matter of fact the photo of me that is on my epinions profile was taken by my 9 year old son with the Polaroid 640 one afternoon at the park.

The camera comes complete with a memory card that will hold 24 pictures on the highest density, however we purchased an additional memory card with a capacity of 90 high density photos.  There is also a 3.5 inch disk adapter available that you can place the memory card in and directly into your computer without having to connect the camera to the computer to download your pics from the cam to the computer.  This adapter sells for around $50, so we have not yet put the money into buying that, because it is not a problem to connect the camera directly to the computer and download your photos.  

One small problem that I have found is on the high density settings, the batteries have a tendency not to last a long time, however we solved that expense with a battery charger and 4 rechargeable AA batteries, so there is always a fresh set charged to change when needed.

I would highly recommend the polaroid 640 for the beginning digital photographer or for the younger user.  Price ranges around $169 but have seen it on sale as low as $149.  The picture quality is very good for an inexpensive piece of photographic equipment.  But of course would we expect anything less from Polaroid!<br><br>
