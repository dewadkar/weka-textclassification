            I will continue to add to this as I break in my new love!

I was walking across the parking lot one day and fell in love.  It was an instant love....Never doubted it or even thought it might be infatuation.

The curves, the look, the body style, it was a total package all in one.  Everything I could want was there, plus things that I didn't even think about.  I was in love with the new 2001 Acura CLS.  What a car!!!

The new Acura CLS is the sport edition to the Acura CL.  Let me tell you, once you get behind the wheel of this car and drive it, you will never want another car for the rest of your life!!!!!  I knew from the moment I saw it that I had to have it.

I purchased a white one with charcoal grey leather interior and grey marbled wood grain.  It's awesome matching up against the gray dash and light gray dash displays.  Just sitting inside the car and closing the door transforms you to another world of comfort, class and SPEED.

ENGINE
The new Acura CLS sports a 260 horsepower engine.  The fastest in the sedan class.  Goodbye Maxima, you just got passed. (Maxima only has 222)  The new CLS contains a 3.2 liter SOHC VTEC engine, which by the way was designed  for the Acura NSX.  It also features the new PGM-FI system for precise fuel metering and direct ignition system for a hotter, more stable spark and a low-restriction exhause system to help promote better breathing.  The CLS also has an advanced 2-stage intake manifold and a higher compression ratio.  All in all, it will definately slam your head to the back of your seat....I LOVE IT!!!!  All of this and the new No Schedule Tune-up until 100,000 policy.

EXTERIOR
The new Acura CLS has the new 17 inch tires for better handling, grip and comfort.  It also provides a more sporty look to the overall exterior of the car.  

To help remove road noise, the new Acura has front and rear suspensions mounted on seperate subframes.  These subframes are then connected tot he chassis through rubber isolators which effectively dampen undesirable vibration and harshness.  It definately worked because there is no road noise or anything when you are in this car.  You feel and sound like your floating above the ground.

The CLS also comes with an optional rear spoiler (not installed at build time), aluminum-allow wheels and sunroof wind deflector.  The salesman stated that none of their CLS's would come with spoilers or deflectors this year from the factory, all of them had to be after factory add-ons but all add-ons, at time of purchase, would be covered by the same warranty that the car is under.

INTERIOR
The new Acura CLS has an awesome interior.  All come with standard:

Leather, power everything, simulated wood-grain trim, power driver and passenger seat, leather wrapped steering wheel, sport oriented seats for better comfort and stability when your racing around curves, heated front seats, automatic climate control, Bose In-Dash 6 disc CD changer, metallic sport gauges (awesome look), keyless entry and  two-driver memory functions to allow easy repositions of the steering wheel and seat.

Options available include:  The rear spoiler, sunroof wind deflector, the Acura Navigation system (really nice!) plus a few others. There aren't many options available since most normal options are included as standard on the CLS.

SAFETY FEATURES
Drivers and Front Passengers Air bags
Drivers and Front Passengers Side Air bags
3-point seatbelts
Rear Child Safety-Seat Anchors
Traction Control System
ABS (naturally)
Vehicle Stability Assist
Xenon Headlights
Impact Crumple Zones
Auto Day/Night Rearview Mirror (A wonderful plus)
Safety Glass (avoids explosion and shattering of windshield)

Overall, the Acura CLS gets a 10 from my book.  It has power, class, comfort, style, handling and everything else you could think of.  The cost is extremely reasonable compared to the rest of the cars in the market.  The base price on the majority that I looked at was $31,800.  This was almost a standard price that never changed.  Acura also has a great warranty program for 4 years or 50,000 miles which adds to the benefit of having an Acura.

This is my first Acura (Acura is made by Honda), and it won't be my last.  It's a perfect car thus far and I love it.  Go test drive one and you won't be disappointed.  You will want to buy one!!!!!<br><br>
