            I recently purchased a 2000 KIA Sportage with the ex package. I was in a delima with the fact I had a 1998 Olds Achieva to get out of and extremely upside down... Being I have to use my vehicle for my Job and pack several boxes I knew it was best for me to go with a SUV type vehicle and my car just didn't do it size or mechanically with only 49000 miles and a engine light shop lover it was.  Needless to say to unload a problem like that I had to watch my price range and a used vehicle I would not be able to get financed being upside down.  I have had my KIA less than a month and so far I am very happy with no real problems after 2000 miles in less than two weeks.  I am sure that this vehicle is like many others and can have its share of problems.  I am a firm believer of two vehicles comeing off the assembly line and one having the potential to be great and the other may unfortunatley be the lemon.  I think I got the good one for a change.
I dislike the fact of the ciggarette lighter pulled out of the dash... but my dealer takes really good care of me and my KIA.  The only other dislike is I pack this full of boxes and would have liked the rear seats to have laid a bit more flat so I could have folded them down instead of having to set the boxed items in the seat.  I really don't like my spare tire on the rear, I would have rathered a design to alow it to mount underneath the vehicle.
I am overall so satisfied... and well different stokes for different fokes.<br><br>
