            i had a year 2000 Saturn SL1.  The car was overrated.  it cost like 20000 and it was only capable of reaching 103 mph.  Also i get in a little fender bender (i hit a stationary car at 45 mph) and the car was totaled!  i thought it was supposed to have like crumple zones or something and it was totaled.  and in my first accident i hit a honda and it wasn't damaged at all and i did $2000+ damage to my car.  couldn't they make their car a little sturdier for the price.  i remember being in the dealership and they had articles about people who were hit by big cars that were moving fast and there wasn't any damage or something like that.  also my windshield wiper stopped working just because my friend turned it on and off a couple times when it wasn't raining.  i would recommend this car to people who don't speed and don't plan on crashing.  And the salespeople seemed nice.<br><br>
