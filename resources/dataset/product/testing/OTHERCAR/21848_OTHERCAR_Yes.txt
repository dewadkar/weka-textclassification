            test driving the v40 was a pleasure. volvo was the first dealership that i went to where no one pressured or pushed me. they gave me the keys and said: "enjoy". i took the car out on 3+ mile test drive and really enjoyed myself. while maintaining the wagon status, volvo has produced a vehicle that can be fun to drive. although the engine may be a bit small at 160hp, it is turbocharged and delivered slightly above average acceleration for a wagon of any size. it was a comfortable, quiet ride and the car drove really well. the interior is comfortable and solid in design. the only downside is that for a wagon, it has a relatively small back seat that comfortably fits two larger kids, but squeezes three. the trunk is also small compared to the ford (and mercury), and the subaru outback legacy. other than those two factors, for the money, it is a better buy than the Ford or Subaru. go out and drive one yourself.

P.s. also the safest car of the three. it is the only one with a steal cage surrounding all the riders. it also has side impact beams and side impact bags.
