            I looked and looked for the perfect car and finally found it. Even after choosing the Diesel Jetta (after extensive research) it took me 2 years to actually seal the deal (mostly 'cause I didin't have the money). There is NO other car that can compare to a Diesel Jetta in this price range (and even in the few thousand more range). First, throw out every misconception you have with a diesel engine. They are no longer loud (they put out a different sound but it's not loud), they don't smell, and they DO have pep... Every option imaginable is available (including some that only come with more expensive cars). You will save money on gas regardless of how you drive (average twice as much km's than a normal gas engine, which means half the cost... for the life of the car!!!). It is one of the safest cars on the road (loads of airbags). 

What really sold me were the little things that you can't get even as options with other similarly priced cars.
Defrost side mirrors, and washer nozzles.
Different levels of heated seats (1 to 5)
Really functionnal and ajustable armrest (most cars have the useless kind)
Seats and steering column that ajust in every direction make it easy to find a comfortable driving position
Easy pop out lever to lift the hood (instead of looking for it everywhere under the hood)
Multi Funtion Steering wheel with cruise control and stereo controls (real usefull)
Amazing trunk room and configuration (the trunk brakets aren't in the way when you have a full trunk)
Four wheel disc brakes with ABS
Perfect location and configuration of the ashtray for loose change (seems small but it's nice for a big coffee drinker like me!)
Eight speaker sound system
Longer warranty than most manufacturers i've seen
And, just one of the sexiest cars on the road!!!

I've only had it for a few days, so this will be updated at a further date. This is not really a first impression because I have been shopping for this car for over 2 years. Everything I knew it would be it was. I'll let you know in a few thousand km's how she's doing.
