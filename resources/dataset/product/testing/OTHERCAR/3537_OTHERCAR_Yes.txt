            I received the Hewlett Packard Photosmart C315 Digital Camera recently as a present.  I am involved in a digital photography class at school which works with web design and this camera is perfect.  

It's small enough to carry anywhere.  The camera runs from about $250-350 depending on where you purchase it.  You can zoom in up to 2.5 times the actual size the picture should be.  You have to opportunity to take a picture just like a normal 35mm camera, or open the view finder, and view it before taking it.  There is also an automatic focus light that turns green when the picture is ready to be taken.  

It has three different options about the quality of pictures you want to take.  It allows up to 10 superfine quality picture, 20 fine quality pictures, or 80 standard quality pictures.  With web-design, the superfine quality usually works the best with accordance to Adobe Photoshop.  

In order to work with web design, a 2.1 megapixel is the required level, which works nicely for beginners who are so sure about how involved they might get with web design.  The C315 comes with a USB connector, which connects straight into many computers. 

The camera also comes with the software to touch up the photos.  It only takes about 1 minute to download all of your pictures, and the battery lasts for a long time!  Also, within the software, you have the opportunity to email photos or send them to a website.  For example, my family uses Myfamily.com, and the software allows you to send your pictures directly to the site.   

A downfall is that the camera doesn't come with an adapter, but that can be bought at an affordable price of about $30-50.  Other than that, I think this product is great!

There are also many other camera products that can be bought in addition to this camera for different effects.  So, if you're looking for something that can grow with your skill, this is the way to go with the Hewlett Packard C315 Digital Camera!  It can do almost anything!
