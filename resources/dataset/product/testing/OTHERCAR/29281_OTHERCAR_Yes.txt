                 The first great car of the millennium dawned it's face at the showroom of Chevrolet dealership's across the country. It holds the name 2000 Camaro Z28. I had the pleasure of receiving one of these monsters of the road one month ago. In this last month I have realized how much a little horsepower can help the automobile's appeal. 
     At first site the Camaro looks to be a mix between a family sedan and a sports coupe. It's not a prelude to what is in store that is for sure. The family car image completely disappears with the first growl of the 305 hp V8 it house below it's bland exterior. The inside of the Camaro is a wonderful mix of sports styling and sheer elegance. From the down soft leather seats to the aggressive gauge cluster, the interior is flawless. The back seats were a little cramp for leg room, but that has no relevance once you are imprinted deep into the seats by the slingshot like take off, that shoots you from 0 to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, of this powerhouse. 
     The power displayed in first through third gear had no equal. Forth and fifth gear are not as impressive though. Don't get me wrong they were not weak in any way, just not as extreme as there predecessors. The moment of truth came when I encountered my first hairpin turn. 
    I switched on the traction control and said a little prayer. Barreling in at 45 mph I leaned into the turn. The car responded with glue like tire grip. Apart from as little tire chirp through the apex of the curve this is the best handling car I have ever driven. Coming out of the turn I was glowing with anticipation of the next turn, when I realized the only thing I haven't tested was the brakes. 
     With no warning I mashed my foot on the brake pedal and almost instantly was slung to a complete halt. The most amazing part was not what happened but what did not happen, my brakes didn't lock up. All and all I would have to say this has been the most exciting month of my entire life. The car will soon be declare the peak of the Camaro's
long history.<br><br>
