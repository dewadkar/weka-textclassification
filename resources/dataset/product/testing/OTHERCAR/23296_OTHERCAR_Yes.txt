            Some people swear at these cars, and some swear by them. It goes both ways. I have owned one for 5 years and it had 80,000 miles on it when I bought it. It now has 156,000 miles on it. Out of regular maintenance; I have changed the shocks and struts (including mounts), fuel filter, spark plug wires, battery, a transmission fluid change, and exhaust (Exhaust is due to being in winter climate that kills them) The body is still a brilliant red, but has a few rust spots in places and some of the rocker panels have started to rust away. 

These cars are not very expensive and so are easy to pickup usually in any community. One thing that I have found that keeps this model vehicle in good running order, is making sure you always have your oil changed a manufacture recommended intervals. The mpg is okay but I have seen better. I get around 29 as an average. The car is not fast, it doesn't really have any bells and whistles, but it is a dependable car for a fair price.
