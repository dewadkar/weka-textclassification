            Having just purchased a Sedona EX with all features (except a rear spoiler), I still cannot believe I was able to purchase it at the cost price to the dealer in Spokane, WA.

Every aspect of this vehicle is just striking.  Ours is a two-tone, ruby red and gray, with gray interior, and it is just gorgeous.  The instrument panel is clearly readable, and the sound system is loaded with features.  We felt that the leather seats were worth purchasing, as they are quite a lot nicer than the cloth seats.  There is a lot of space for storage.  The power options are easily controlled by the driver of the vehicle.  At this time, there is just nothing that I regret about having to purchase this vehicle.  Two years ago, my sister purchased a Toyota Sienna, and for a base LE model she paid the same as I did for this EX, fully loaded.  A friend of mine has an Odyssey Van.  He paid 29,000 for his, and it has less features (e.g., no sunroof.)  Of course, Kia's reliability history will take time to develop to be at a level of Toyota or Honda, but I just could not see what would attract me to one of those vehicles over this one (well, gas mileage would be the only consideration.)  More than anything, the Sedona EX is better looking than any Sienna or Odyssey that I have seen.

My wife and I live in western Washington State, and were aware that this vehicle was in the Spokane Kia lot for a few weeks, at least.  Unlike the Greater Seattle area, where they are selling like crazy, the popularity of this vehicle has not caught on in many places, and I think the dealer was just happy to get it off of the lot.  Their service was just terrific.  They wanted to make a sale, but in no respect did we feel pressured, particularly as they sold the vehicle to us a dealer cost.  I have to believe there are other deals like this still to be had, and that it is worth the travel to purchase a vehicle as closely to factory invoice as possible.
