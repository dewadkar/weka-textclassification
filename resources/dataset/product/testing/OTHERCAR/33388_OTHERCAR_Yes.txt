            Rating the 99 New Jetta GL:

I've had this car for a little over two years now and have been very happy with it. I've had no major services or problems since purchasing. I love the interior design and feel very comfortable with it's safety features. My only major recommendation would be more comfortable seats.

More Pros:
You get so much for the price in this car. I was able to get mine for about $15K on an advertised special.  For that price you get a car that was based on the considerably more expensive Audi A4 body. You get all kinds of features like 4 wheel disc brakes, ABS, Side airbags, AC, even side mirror heaters! I can't think of another car where features like this come in the base model. The GL doesn't have power windows or cruise control (!), which is a bit odd. But I figure that's just one less thing to break.

Cons: 
HARD and narrow seats. Their supposed to be supportive, but these go a little to far.  The 2.0 engine is somewhat underpowered. If you are a typical driver then it should be fine, but you won't be drag racing anyone. Many, including myself have experienced some oil consumption in this engine. If you will be sticking to the recommended 5K service interval, pay attention to the oil levels! If you are considering a Jetta I would recommend test driving all the engines to see which feels right (TDI, VR6, 1.8T and 2.0).
