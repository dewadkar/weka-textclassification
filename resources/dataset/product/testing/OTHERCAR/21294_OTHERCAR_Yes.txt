            I agree with all the opinions about the Toyota Camry LE.  I purchased a 1992 Camry LE a few years ago and have been nothing but happy with it.  I was leary at first to purchase a foreign car, but after LOTS of research on car performance, reliability, space, and value, the Toyota Camry won out over all other cars. 

For a mid-size sedan, the Camry is extremely spacious in the back seat.  My husband is the testing tool for cars by being 6 feet 3 inches tall and having long legs.  He is able to sit in the back seat of this car with both front seats pushed all the way back.  It also has plenty of room for a car seat and two people next to it.  

There are two main problems that we have experienced with our particular Camry.  First, the braking system has caused some headaches.  It has been grinding on and off, yet nothing can be found wrong with it.  Second, on extremely cold days, it is difficult, if not near impossible, to defog the rear passenger windows completely.  Neither air source, temperature, nor fan speed seems to make a difference in the quality of defrosting.  It is able to defog the windshield and 90% of the front seat windows adequately.  This seems to be the most problematic on days where the temperature or wind chill is below zero.

Regardless, I have been very happy with this car, and plan on continuing to buy Camry's in the future.<br><br>
