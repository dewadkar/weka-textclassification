                   I'm currently leasing a 1997 Hyundai Elantra.  I needed a car right away, and I needed a good deal.  I heard about Hyundai's low leasing plans.  They were right about the low leasing plan.  The monthly payments are low, just what I need since i am in school.  I couldn't afford much at the time, and Hyundai seemed to fit my budget.       I have 8 months left on my 3-year lease. I'm looking forward to turning it in.  Its not the best car on gas.  It eats gas, which isn't very economical for me.  I just recently had to put new breaks in the car, which was a very expensive job. I never expect that to be needed in only two years of driving.  <br>     The car is starting to constantly stall on me.  When ever I stop, the car shuts off.  This could be very troublesome.  Very early in my lease, the speakers started to go.  The car also doesn't have much pickup.<br>     The positive thing about the car is the comfort.  It's very roomy inside.  There is tons of leg and head room, which makes it very comfortable for larger people. The seats are comfortable, which make long trips pleasant.  I also love the looks of the exterior.  <br>     I think the Hyundai, particularly the Elantra, are good for people who need a ride at an affordable price.  It definately was the most affordable out there.  I wouldn't purchase one, however, they make a good lease.  It will last me the 3 years, without needed much work as an older car. <br><br><br>
