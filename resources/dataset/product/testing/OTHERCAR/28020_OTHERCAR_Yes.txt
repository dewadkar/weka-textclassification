            I've had mine since early june 1998 when this car was first released.  I received the car with 20 miles and have only put 54k on it since.  My maintenance record includes 
2 new front tires @ 30k miles, 
new front brake pads/calipers/rotors @ 31k miles, 
new rear brake pads @ 31k miles,
engine coolant change @ 48k miles,
oil every 3k miles,
headlamp right @ 33k miles, right @ 43k miles,
right rear tail light every 5k miles (i hate this!)

Overall, the maintenance on the car hasn't been too terrible, considering i drive the car a bit hard.  My major complaints are the tail lights, the seemingly unsafe brakes (not enough stopping power, thanks to the rear drum brakes) and the 'slushiness' of the suspension.  

I have the SE2 which is the SE with the performance package and is supposed to include a tougher suspension, but the car has serious understeer issues.  I added a front strut tower bar when the car had about 40k miles on it and that improved the understeer a bit.  

But the car is still slushy.  Don't buy this if you're looking for a hybrid family/fun car.  Get something more sport oriented, especially in the suspension.  But the ga does have plenty of power and i have the speeding ticket to prove it.  

This car is an excellent grocery getter, a bit fuel thirsty for city driving, but overall a nice car.
