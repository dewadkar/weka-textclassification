            I own a 1994 Legend and a 1988 two door coupe. They have both performed flawlessly.  They are luxury at an affordable price. Both of my cars have not had any problems. I got the 1988 last year and I got the 1994 about 3 years ago.  They are both reasonably fast I got my 94 to go 139mph. My 88 is a 5spd and it will do around 131mph.  Both of these cars handel extreamly well and should not give you any problems. The paint job on these cars is very good. My 1988 has its orginal paint and it still looks and drives like a new car.  If you value relability,comfort,performance, style, and a good price this is the car for you .<br><br>
