            I got my '92 Camry LE (4-cyl) back in high school and put 207k miles on it until I forgot to put the oil cap on during a oil change and damaged the engine. After changing out the engine, the car runs great, the handling is great due to a nice stiff chassis (well, stiff for a passenger car) and springs well suited to a comfortable ride. The suspension rides over bumps very well without nudging you to one side or the other. The engine is Toyota's 5S-FE (F means fuel-economy in Toyota's engine codes, E for DOHC) which produces a good amount of torque in the low range, so when the light turns green, you don't have to rev hard to get the car going. If you have a lead foot, though, the engine is not designed to produce lots of power in the upper range. Once the car is revved past 4000 RPMs, the engine feels gutless. Again, one of the characteristics of Toyota tuning for low-end torque. I once drove my friend's '93 V6 Camry and the engine power was much better, but the car felt very front-heavy. Cabin space is very roomy. Can you believe that back in high school, I once fit 9 people into the car? I'm not recommending it, but it can be done! If you like working on cars yourself, the Camry is fairly easy to work with under the hood. Oil changes are a snap since once you open the hood the filter is right there staring at you. The alternator has a handy tightening screw, so you don't have to manhandle it when replacing it with a new one. Overall build quality of the car is excellent. Mine was built in Japan. I believe '92 is the year that Toyota started building the Camrys in the US, so when you buy a '92, check to see where the car was built. The VIN is a giveaway, since you can just look at the first two characters. 'JT' means (J)apan-made (T)oyota. Also, if you can, test drive the 4-cylinder and V6 versions to see which you like better.
