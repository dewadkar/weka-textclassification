            I have a 94 Nissan Altima and I love it and I want to write about it!  I'm sure there are plenty of people here at eopinions who can't afford to buy 2000 and 2001 cars.  So I'm going to break the rules!

A year ago my 91 Oldsmobile was totaled. My husband and I are trying to save up for a house so we knew we didn't want a huge car payment.  I also knew that I wouldn't be able to find a reliable car for the $3500 that I got from my insurance company for mine.  

So I did some research online and started looking at cars.  I knew I wanted foreign and I knew that I would like a car that was green but that of course wasn't high on my list.  More important then finding a green car was finding a car quickly because in the mean time I had no car! 

I really wanted to get a Honda Civic or Accord.  I quickly learned that Hondas do not depreciate much as they get older!  I also had a hard time even finding any hondas at all.  My theory is that people just buy them and drive them until they wear out or sell them to friends and family.  I also considered a Camry which is what our other car is but I didn't see many of those either.  

Every dealership I went to I would tell them I was looking for a foreign car for around $7000 and what would they show me?  Saturns, Neons, and Grand Ams!  Hello!  

I was very stuck on getting a foreign car because the Oldsmobile I had and our Camry were the same year with the same amount of miles but we put a lot more money into the Olds.  

Then while test driving cars a salesman said &quot;why don't you try this Nissan Altima.  I drove it and fell it love!  All the cars I have been driving where 4 cylinder but the altima seemed to have more kick to it. The salesman said it was because of the fuel injection engine.  

I also liked that Nissan used the same body style I think until 1997.  So I�m driving around in my 94 but people don�t know if it is a 94 or a 96. I also like the button for the trunk, the child lock doors, and that it tells you if you leave your lights on.  

Of course this one sold while waiting for my check from the insurance company.  I then checked online and the paper and visited every 93 and 94 Altima in all of St. Louis.  

I had it narrowed down to two of them both 94 one black and one green.  I took both cars to a mechanic and they both checked out.  I justified paying more for the green one because it had less miles on it.  With the money down from the insurance company and a 3 � year loan our payments are only $118 a month.  

I have had my car for a year and I just love it! The only thing I have had done to it was new front breaks.  I figured I would need them sometime this year because the black altima with more miles had just had them put on.  Also the used car dealership has put on cheap tires so I had to get new ones so I wouldn't slide in the rain, but that isn't the car's fault.  

My only complaint about this car is that it is hard to install car seats in it.  I'm actually a certified car seat technician and I have trouble!  The problem has to do with the fact that the short end of the seat belt is too long.  Nissan has now fixed this problem and newer ones have better seat belts.  Also it is impossible to fit three car seats in the back.

I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable car.
