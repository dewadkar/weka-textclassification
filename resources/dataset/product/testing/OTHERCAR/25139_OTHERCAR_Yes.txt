            I've had this camera for about almost 2 years now.  It was my first digital camera and I've been very happy with it.

The best feature about this camera is it's size.  It's small enough to fit in your pocket so it's easy to carry with you on any type of outing which means you'll be more likely to carry it around and take more pictures.

The camera connects very easily to the computer via USB cable.  It comes with a rechargable proprietary battery and an 8MB compact flash type 1 card (far too small to be useful).  The first thing you'll want to do it purchase a bigger card which are very inexpensive now.  Although the battery life is not that great, it does the job for most applications.  You just need to make sure you recharge it after each outing to prevent being stuck with a dead battery.  You could opt to buy a backup but at $50, I think your money is better spent on a larger memory card.

In addition to beautiful stills, the camera is capable of taking short (30 seconds or less) movie clips.  The larger the resolution the shorter the clips.  I've found this both a blessing and a curse.  At times I've wished I could capture more than 15 or 20 seconds but I've also found people enjoy watching these clips more than they do watching a 2 hour video of your vacation.  These clips record sound and can be reviewed on the camera but there is no speaker for sound playback on the camera, you just need to wait until you get back to a computer to play the sound.

The camera has a very solid feel to it, powers up quickly for a digital camera and has numerous adjustable settings to change color, shutter speed, brightness, etc.

The 2X zoom prevents you from taking distance photos but this camera is a great all around unit that will satisfy most casual photographers.
