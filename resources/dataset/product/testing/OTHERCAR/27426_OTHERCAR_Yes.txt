            The Dodge Neon is a good car for someone who does not have a large family,and travels a lot.  It gets great mileage on the highway, but not so good in the city.  When in a pinch and needing to get out of a situation, this car can do the job.  The main issue is the fact that it is difficult for anyone over 5'7&quot; to get into and out of.  The seats are built for the smaller person.  It looks good, handles well, and over all is a good little car.  Don't try to buy 2 weeks groceries and expect to be able to have a passenger though. The other item is that you can expect the car to be in the shop at least twice a year, once for engine issues, and once for break/tire issues.  If either of these bothers you, don't buy a Dodge Neon, or don't drive as much as I do.<br><br>
