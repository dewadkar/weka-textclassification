            I recently bought a 2000 cavalier and I love it. For the money it is a great car. It runs smooth and it built solidly. My father has worked with cars for over 30 years and he feels this car is a good buy. Another person's comment on here stated that he felt unsafe in it. Let me tell you it is one of the safest. My boyfriend has had his for 3 years and been in 5 accidents (4 of which were not his fault) the car has been fixed every time and runs fine. We call it the tank. in one incident he was broad sided by a deer and the police told him if he was in any other car he would be dead.(The cavaliers have steel side impact beems)  isn't that the bottom line? The only thing bad i can see about it is that the back seat is cramped, but hey i bought it for me to ride in and im not married nor do i have any kids.it is an excellent investment for the price for any person. Despite its price it is even good for a family car as far as the four doors are concerned. Say what you want about my car, but I love it. <br><br>
