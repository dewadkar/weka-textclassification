            After getting sold on the concept of digital vs. traditional cameras, I settled on the Canon ELPH (S-100).  Attractive to me were:  the Canon name, the size of the camera, the fact that it had in excess of the &quot;magic&quot; number of 2.0 pixels, and the ease of operation.

In general, I have been pleased.  The camera is a lot of fun and takes nice pictures.  (I am taking a lot more pictures given the digital technology).  I'm still working on downloading the pictures, but think this will work just fine.  My only complaint so far is that the camera is so small that I often get my finger in the picture in vertical shots.

I felt a little deceived by the packaging, however.  Excluded from the package were some absolute necessities:  an AC adaptor, an extra battery, an extra and larger CF card and a carrying bag.  Note that while operation with an AC adaptor is recommended for downloading to the computer or watching your shots on TV (very cool), the adaptor is not included in the package--it costs $59.  Note also that the battery that comes with the $59 adaptor works only when plugged in, so I still have to buy a backup battery (I think around $20).  The FC 8M compact flash disk that is included with the unit stores only 12 pictures at the recommended setting, so you guessed it...I had to purchase a larger CF card (32M -- captures 52 images) for $79.  Finally, I bought a $15 bag to carry all this stuff.  So...my $450 ELPH really costed around $625. <br><br>
