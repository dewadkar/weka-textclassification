            I was looking for a fun, sporty coupe so one of the first cars I went to get check out is the new for 00 Eclipse GT.  It had a new 3.0 200 hp V6 with the sportronic auto trans and 205 with the manual.  I test drove the sportronic and it had pretty good acceleration and a cool interior.  The back seat was so cramped my head hit the glass windshield in the back.  The trunk was fairly large and can fit a suitcase or two.  The first corner I took with the GT i hit the gas hard and made the tires spin and you can tell the engine was strong.  But at speeds of 60-70 the car isn't that fast even when downshifting to 3rd or 2nd with the sportronic.  0-60 is in the mid 7's but it doesn't feel it.   The only problems with this car are the standard equipment and option packages.

A very important feature, ABS, isn;t even available on the lower RS and GS models.  On the GT its not standard but available only with a package that includes traction cntrl, side airbags, sunroof, 7-spkr infinity stereo, spoiler, etc.  The only stand alone option is the sportronic.  The salesman that I spoke to was very sneaky and anxious in getting me in the car that day.  He tried to explain to me what a package is when I asked why ABS isn't standard.  Some of the standard features are pretty impressive such as the 17&quot; rims on sticky rubber.  

Overall it was a pretty good car, but with the reliability problems with past generations and the Mitsubishi name I don't think I would buy this car.  I've heard many complaints even about the new 00 eclipse's and leaks dealing with the driver's windows and other minor problems.  <br><br>
