                After reading all the other reviews on this car, most of them (although excellent in content and product specifications), appear to be from those who have not owned VW's in the past, and few describe the actual owning experience of the car.  So i will tackle that in this review.
    I traded in my 1996 GTi VR6 many months ago for this 2000 Futura Yellow GTi GLX.  I have owned many Volkswagens before this, am an extreme VW fanatic, and I am a salesman at a VW dealership.  (I drive these cars every day).   When trading in the old GTi for the new, i was looking at this move as more of an upgrade in status quo than for a better car.
   The new GTi is amazingly smooth and luxurious, something that was absent in VW's of years past.  This GTi is the Mercedes of Volkswagen, which makes sense considering that Volkswagen is attempting to take Mercedes head on in the next couple of years.  In doing so, they have lost the sportiness that the GTi's of the years past have had, the fun-to-drive nature that gave the original GTi its name.  Do not get me wrong, this 2000 GTi is a blast to drive, has a great personality, and has a strong cult following.  What i am saying is, the car has grown up a LOT - and in this case, that may not entirely be the best thing.
   The last GTi was not as refined.  There was less solidity, less build quality, less insulation and sound-deadening material.   The gearbox wasn't as smooth and the engine not as tame.  These qualities, although looked down upon by the public in general, are what gave the GTi its raw sex appeal.  It was the raw unharnessed power, fun to throw around, bang the gears kind of driving that made the GTi famous.   The new GTi is now a Super Touring highway cruiser.
    There are many times that i am driving along on the street, and a car wants to race mine.  Its times like these, or for instance going to the track, that i miss my old GTi VR6.   The last generation VR6 was faster.  Don't let the figures in car magazines fool you.  The new GTi VR6 is definitely fast - but not as fast as the last one.  Consider about 300 lbs. difference in weight, only 2 less horsepower, and an easier gearbox to really irk the most power out of your engine in the older GTi.   The old GTi was the track star - the new GTi is the classy star (three-pointed star?)
    From the owners standpoint, reliability is of course traditional volkswagen.  Great, minus one or two things.  The only problems i have had (now have 18K miles on my car) is the window regulators.  This is a problem i have seen with almost all 2000 Volkswagens with power windows.  This involves either driver or passenger side windows basically falling down in the door, off the track and rattling around in the door.  This was a result from a faulty supplier of window regulators for the 2000 model year.
     The only other problem i have had is the lever that pulls the seats forward to allow access into the rear seats come off on each side.  But, if those are the worst things you can find to complain about the car, then you are pretty well off.
    Owning one of these cars does command a certain level of elitism.  For starters, they don't build too many of these cars.  At the moment, (start of 2001 model year), the factory is on strike.  There is a 6-month waiting list for this car, regardless of color.   I was going to trade mind in for a Passat, but when i realized how hard they are to find, i decided to keep my GTi.  That and i researched to find out there were only 200 Futura Yellow GTis sold in North America.  So my car is a rare one indeed.  I frequently find myself getting offers upwards of $25,000 for my GTi at the dealership by customers.  Like i said, you just can't find a new one around anymore.
     All in all, the new GTi GLX is an excellent car.  Grown up, the GTi is no longer a youth.  This car is great for the young professional, or older gentleman looking to reclaim his youth.  If you are going to buy your kid a GTi, I would opt for an older one.  If you can find one of these cars in a dealership - BUY IT.<br><br>
