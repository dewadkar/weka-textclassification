            After shopping around a great deal, we purchased a 1999 Grand Am last year and absolutely love it. We found the Grand Am the best value for a mid size car.  The car handles very well on the road in all weather.  The traction control makes it easy to drive on snow and ice.  The car is quiet and comfortable.  

The car looks sporty yet is perfect for a family of four.  We are hoping to expand our family to five and I believe we will be able to fit all five us comfortably as well.

There is plenty of leg room in the back and a large trunk to carry virtually anything you would want to carry in a car.  Due to the width of the car, I recommend the electric locks and windows package which we have and it works wonderfully.  The windows operate smoothly and quickly.  The electric windows come with a switch so that the children in the back seat cannot open the window when the switch is in the windows locked mode - yet the driver can still put down the window.  

The seats are height adjustable which is great for my husband and I since he's tall and I'm short.  This vehicle has the most comfortable seats I've ever had in a vehicle.
  
We also have the moon roof.  I'm not sure if the moon roof is the reason the roof seems a little low in this vehicle or not but I am by no means a tall person and I am annoyed at the level of the roof.

The car gets average gas mileage, has great pickup, and is a pleasure to drive.  We've had the car nearly a year and have had no mechanical problems with it.  Overall, I'd recommend the car to anyone looking for a mid size car with a great price.<br><br>
