            The 7 Series incorporates both worlds of the Sports Car, and of the most comfortable car you will ever be in. One minute you can be hiting the accelerator with for head pinned against your seat, and the next you can be going strait down the highway with no sound, no bumbs, and a smooth calm ride. 

The seats in tack are more comfortable that those of may front seats in cars. And the front seats, well, they are better than an airplane!! It has Automatic everything, and even in the 740i, there is room for me (I am 6'1&quot;, to stretch all the way out) The iL has even more. 

I have always had an Audi, and it was actually my son who got me to tak a test drive of one of these, and after that, there was no choice. Its pretty good on gas mileage, about 19gpa, and by the way the computer tells you everything form gas mileage, to average speeed, to arrival time if you program it, to a stopwhatch. Also the 440 watt sound system can add a little Zing to your wheels!! The only problem is light colors look a little funky with the black cladding on the bottom.

Check it out at www.bmwusa.com   , and definately test drive one, and you will see what i am talking about. Also check out BMW's Certified Pre-Owned. They give you a better warenty than one on a new car. <br><br>
