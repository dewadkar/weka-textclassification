            We bought the Mazda Tribute LX-V6 after looking at Toyota 4Runners, Ford Explorers, and Honda Passports.  We were amazed at the amount of interior room...my husband is 6'2" with exceptionally long legs.  He has more than enough room both in the front and back seats.  Our two kids are not cramped in the back seat like they were in our previous car.  There is plenty of cargo room to take said kids on a long distance trip, even packing travel cribs and strollers.  We like the fact that you can access the cargo area either just through the rear window which pops open or by opening the whole door.

The Tribute is exceedingly kicky, as well.  The acceleration is awesome.  It also handles well in the snow and ice.  We don't feel any "roll" when we execute driving maneuvers in the Tribute, unlike the Explorer.

We also drove the Ford Escape, but the exterior is somewhat different and we didn't like it as much.  The interior of the Escape was also not nearly as luxurious as the Tribute.

We do wish, though, that the gas tank was a little bigger.  It could use a few more gallons.

All in all, we are thrilled with our purchase and recommend this vehicle to anyone who can't store a monster SUV like the Expedition.  Zoom zoom!
