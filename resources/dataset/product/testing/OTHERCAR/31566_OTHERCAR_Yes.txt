            My old '83 Volvo DL Wagon came to me by happy accident when, two days before my college departure, the car I was supposed to drive down to school went out of commission.  The Volvo was a very reliable car that started right up on the coldest of days without fuss, and the huge cargo area held more than a lot of SUVs do.  On the downside, though; the car had the acceleration of a go-cart.  After a few years, I moved to Colorado and had to get rides to go up in the mountains because the Volvo simply couldn't get up those steep grades (especially with an automatic transmission).  A car that weighs that much needs a six-cylinder engine, in my opinion.  Also, Volvo didn't offer front-wheel drive back then (they claimed that the heaviness of the car made it unnecessary), so driving in the snow was a lesson in sideways aerodynamics.  I sold the car in '97 prior to a mountain trip for something with more power - a 1980 Datsun 510 Wagon. (!)  All things considered, I'd buy another Volvo, as long as I didn't have to drive up many steep hills. <br><br>
