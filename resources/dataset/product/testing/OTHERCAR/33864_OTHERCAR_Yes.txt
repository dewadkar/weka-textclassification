            When I was young(er), say 16-20, one of the things I loathed was the minivan.  I guess you could find a ton of people who have heard me say, �I will never drive a minivan.�  They are large, ponderous beasts that seem to defy all I stood for in my youthful automotive enthusiasm.  I never anticipated the arrival of three children in just four years of marriage.  Heck, I never really anticipated marriage <I>or</I> children.  It�s funny how things seem to change when you have a family.  I used to jump off bridges into the lake below without thinking twice.  Now, well� I�d still do it, but I would think about it a little more.  So it is with cars.  I began to find myself gazing at minivans passing by and then turning my head and feeling ashamed for having such impure thoughts.  But eventually I came to the realization that we <I>had</I> to have a minivan; Three child seats in tandem are a tight fit in any back seat.  I always thought it was foolish to look at horsepower figures in minivans, but that�s what I found myself doing.  
<I>So I�ve got this minivan�</I>

<b>Why I Chose Mercury Villager</b>
The Villager and the Nissan Quest were the only vehicles I really considered when I decided to buy a van. In the price range I was shopping, choices were very limited.  Due to reliability issues, I ruled out all <I>Chrysler</I> vans, as I would never buy a pre-�96 Caravan or Town & Country, and �96 & up were either out of my price range or had too much mileage.  The <I>Chevy Trans-sport</I> doesn�t seem to be very reliable and the build quality of all early �90 GM products is questionable.  The older <I>Mazda MPV</I> is too small, and the <I>Toyota Previa</I> is too big and awkward looking.  So basically, I had it narrowed down before I went shopping, it was just a matter of finding the right one.

The <I>Villager</I> and <I>Quest</I> are mechanically identical, made at the same facility, with <I>Nissan</I> engines and all other important parts.  The only differences are cosmetic and ergonomic.  <I>Nissan</I> vehicles are extremely reliable, and I have been a faithful <I>Nissan</I> follower for some time, so I was certain that either of these vehicles would serve the purpose of my family quite well.  The Villager/Quest is also one of the best looking vans on the road, although I prefer the looks of the Quest between the two due to more attractive wheels and a bigger front air-dam.  The retail price is a little lower on the Villager than the Quest, mostly because it is a <I>Mercury</I>.  My van had particularly low mileage, and this, combined with price, was why I chose the Villager.

<b>Driving</b>
The Villager has a good, somewhat firm ride.  The cabin is fairly quiet, with little wind or tire noise.  It�s not as quiet as vans built today, but pretty good considering its age.  The ride is a little more firm than I had expected, but not unpleasantly so.  This firmness makes it a little more fun to drive, however, as it exhibits surprisingly little body roll when cornering.  I was really surprised at how competently this minivan handles.  You will never confuse it for a sport sedan, but it does have a feeling of confidence when cornering, especially when compared to an SUV.  I think that most people will appreciate this, as the Villager doesn�t feel top-heavy like a lot of vehicles, but always feels firmly planted.  This good handling, combined with the great Michelin Rainforce tires that came installed make this van feel very safe and surefooted in all kinds of weather.  Even driving during a downpour, I always feel in control.

The engine is fairly smooth and pulls well.  It�s not a powerhouse, but it is good enough to haul a little something extra, or to get out of harms way if you do something stupid; it won�t leave you a sitting duck on the interstate.  It cruises well and has decent power for passing when you call upon it.  The transmission is smooth, but kind of feels as though it is slipping between 1st and 2nd gears during heavy acceleration, a tactic I believe is used to smooth the otherwise hard shift.  This takes a little getting used to at first, but I never even notice it, anymore.

The brakes are my only concern with my van.  I had a bit of trouble with one brake, and replaced it with a new caliper.  The brake light has begun flashing every now and then, but very infrequently and only for very short periods of time, so I may need to do some more work.  I made the mistake of buying lifetime brake pads at AutoZone (never buy these rock-hard pads) when I replaced them, so the brakes feel like they must be pressed fairly hard before they actually begin to slow the vehicle.  These problems, I feel are isolated to my experience, and my particular vehicle, and I don�t think are due to a defective design or anything.  Sometimes these things just happen, especially on older vehicles, no matter what kind it is.

<b>Utility</b>
The seating configuration of my van seat 7: a bench for three in the rear and a smaller bench for two in the center.  I�m not sure if captain�s chairs are available for the center, but I think the center bench is more useful, with children anyway.  With all the seats in place, cargo space is limited in the rear.  There is room for groceries or some luggage, but if you have to tote a large stroller around, you will have to find another location for anything else.  I don�t think there will be enough luggage space for my family of five on a long trip, so I suppose I will learn to use the roof rack, preferably with one of those aerodynamic roof thing-a-ma-bobs.

One of the points that was pushed heavily when the Quest/Villager was introduced was the flexible cargo area, in which the center seat could be removed, and the rear seat slid as far forward as necessary.  This was fairly innovative back then, but nowadays it is far from it, as newer vans offer a mind-boggling variety of ways that the rear seating/cargo area can be configured.   Still, in this price range it is a little more flexible than most, and is useful for carrying larger cargo.  The center seat is a little heavy, and really requires two people to remove it easily, and the rear seat cannot be removed, but it does fold up to allow a little more space.

<b>Ergonomics</b>
I wish that <I>Mercury</I> would have left well enough alone with the interior, and made it just like the Quest�s.  The instrument panel is distinctively <I>Ford</I>, and has the same screwed-up sense of ergonomics as all other American cars.  I can see the reasoning behind it, in that you want previous <I>Ford/Mercury</I> buyers to find this setup the same as what they are used to, but I just don�t like this layout as much as <I>Nissan�s</I>.  I mean, it�s not going to cause a wreck or anything, but I just don�t get how American manufacturers layout the controls.  The front windshield wipers and turn signals are all on one stalk to the left of the wheel, while the headlight controls are farther forward on the dash, to the left of the gauge cluster, while the rear wiper controls are to the right side of the dash.  In <I>Nissan�s</I> (and most other imports) setup, the turn signals are on the left stalk which also twists to switch on the headlights, while the front wipers are activated via a stalk on the right side of the wheel, which also has a rotating switch for the rear wiper.  A light control stalk on the left; a wiper control stalk on the right: How simple: How intuitive.  At least they left the cruise controls where they belong: on the steering wheel.  The radio controls are standard <I>Ford</I> fare: small, hard to read buttons, that all look alike.  Not a single rotating knob.  But all is not lost: the HVAC (heating, ventilation, A/C) controls are easy enough and there are lots of storage spaces.  The ergonomics are probably just in how you approach it: If you are coming from an American car, you will find everything where you expect it, but if you are coming out of anything else, you�ll just wonder how American car�s got their ergonomics so screwed up.

<I>Overall</b>
There�s a lot to like about the Villager.  It�s as solid a vehicle as you�ll find in this price range, and especially this model year.  It is smallish, which means cargo space is limited, but this pays of in terms of maneuverability, and economy, and still has enough room for 7 to ride comfortably.  The cargo area is fairly flexible, allowing room for large loads.  It has decent power, gets respectable fuel mileage, and handles great for a minivan.  It is a safe, reliable, and not too bad looking vehicle.  If you can find one at a good price with low mileage, I recommend the Quest, as it is a little better looking and I prefer the interior layout, but the Villager is a little more affordable, and is just as good in every other way.  I kinda� like the little light bar across the front, too.  My new philosophy on vans: If you <I>must </I> have a minivan, at least make it the best one you can afford.
