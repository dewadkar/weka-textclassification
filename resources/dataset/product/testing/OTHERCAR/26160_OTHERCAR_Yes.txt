            The first words I would say about the 2001 Toyota Sienna is reliable, dependable, roomy, and most of all safe.  I have been getting my eyes on the Toyota Sienna for years now since I own a 1999 Toyota Sienna LE.  And while visiting to the dealers once or two, I saw the 2001 Toyota Sienna.  My mouth just drop when I saw the lots of changes. Here are the changes on what the brochure and the dealer told me: Much more power, 210 HP with a vvt-i ( variable valve timing w/ intelligence ) which is new not like the other models before.  With that engine, it makes a smoothe ride.  The front and back is much more different also, new tail lamps which have a red and white stripe, and the front offer integrated fog lamps available only on the XLE trim. The middle front part also came different, much nicer than the other yaers.  2 Power doors are available now, that is much more great.  8 speakers are available also plus front side airbags and vehicle skid control for much more safety.  The third row can be adjusted now,<br><br>
