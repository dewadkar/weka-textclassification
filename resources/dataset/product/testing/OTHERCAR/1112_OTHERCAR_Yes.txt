            Do not point at laugh at the mighty Dodge Neon. It is a formidable force on the freeway. I have had the misfortune of having to drive a rental car. That rental car is a 2000 Dodge Neon. At least it's red was what I said. 

But what about that getting blown in the neon part? Well, blown around is what I mean. This little car is HORRIBLE on the highway during medium speed winds. I live along the atlantic coast, and winds are not uncommon. Winds are horrible when going over large bridges, and it is actually frightening going across the bridges in the wind. How does the NEON handle in the snow? It stinks there also. The little bitty tires do not want to turn this car. Go hit a parked car in a parking lot at very low speed. I almost did, twice.

I have much more good things to say about the <b>MIGHTY NEON</b> after 1700 miles. The first being, it's a good thing my rental has unlimited mileage.
Let us begin, <b>THE DEFINITIVE NEON REVIEW!</b>

<b>The Heater.</b> 
The NEON heater absolutely kicks butt! The heater works so well, that I decided to see just how hot the vents got, and I kept my fingers on one of them as I drove until the heat became unbearable and I had to take my fingers away. It was like touching a frying pan that's been cooking bacon. That's warm! This is essential for those of us who have the misfortune of living in the frozen tundra of New England.
Sadly, the heater also has some flaws. The heat vents themselves are the flaws of the NEON. It is a design flaw, we cannot blame this happy little car. But the problem is, the vents on the floor are poor, your feet will not warm at the same rate your chest will, even if you have the heater set on the 50-50 split between upper vent and lower. Never one to leave out any detail, I have noticed yet another flaw in the heating vents. The drivers heating vents. Left side=Good, Right side= POOR! There is no angle you can move the vent to so that your right leg will warm. The rest of you can be getting warm and toasty, but your right leg, which you're driving with, will remain, partially frozen. This is annoying to me. It is as if there is a pocket of cold air directly above the right leg. I keep expecting this cold front to collide with the warm front, and have the perfect storm right in the little NEON.

<b>The Handling.</b>
This little bitty car, which I used to look upon with disdain, holds corners better than almost everything I have ever driven. I couldn't believe something this small, with tiny little tires can manage to actually hold the Neon on turns of all sort. I imagine the NEON would roll over before the back end slides out. NEON corners like it is on rails! It is actually fun to throw the NEON rental into all sorts of hard corners, and stomp on the gas as you get about half way through the corner. Many cars will get loose with a maneuver like that. NEON remains stable. NEON pulls out of the corner with authority.
The NEGATIVES of the handling: Steering. The steering is good and tight, with the steering wheel offering a good amount of resistance when turning, but it requires a large turn of the wheel to actually get the car around. For example, if you wish to take a low speed 90 degree angle turn, as if you were at an intersection, you must turn the wheel one full rotation. The word <b>neon</b>, on the steering wheel, begins right side up, turns upside down, then suddenly there it is right side up again. Finally, I'm done with the turn, and can let it spin all the way back.
That is an awful lot of turning of the wheel to take turns.

<b>Brakes.</b>
4 wheel disc, anti lock brakes. The Neon will not only stop on a dime, it will pick it up. The Neon stops extraordinarily fast. Impressive.

<b>The Interior.</b>
The design of the interior cabin gets two thumbs down from this driver. I haven't ever seen interior design so poor. Let us start with the cup holders. The NEON has two, that is two more than my car, so one would thank that is good. But the location of the cup holders is absurd. They are practically on the floor below the radio. So, if you wish to grab your cup of coffee, (or your beer, if you're into drinking and driving) you have to lean way over to grab it. I believe the cup holders were designed for someone like Inspector Gadget. Because without Go-Go Gadget arms, you can't reach the cup while remaining seated in the same position.

<b>RADIO.</b>
OK, I've been angry at this radio since day one. I don't care if it has something like 12 presets, (each number holds two stations). It is also placed low on the console. So low that you have to reach down for the radio also. I expect to get carpal tunnel syndrome changing the channels. The angle is so poor you have to reach down, extend hand and find the buttons. This is HORRIBLE! It does nothing but facilitate the driver taking his/her eyes off the road in order to look at the radio to see what to press, good thing those brakes are so good, or you could look up and hit someone. The radio continues to stink. It does not have a SCAN button. It only has seek. It is inherently wrong to have a radio without a scan button. So there you are, you have to keep hitting Seek, Seek, Seek, to bounce around the stations to try to find what channel doesn't have an ad on. Scan is needed. The Bass also is horrible, the NEON cannot be used as a ghetto ride. It will be laughed at with its' meek bass.

<b>Windows.</b>
Stupid things, weird angles they roll down at do not facilitate one rolling the window down partially in order to hang your arm out. They also develop extremely annoying squeaks when going down. It was a piercing screech only inches from my ear which made me thankful for winter, and keeping the window up. The window also is a somewhat odd shape, when the window is up, if you don't open the door wide, you can easily catch clothing on the corner of the top of the window. I know. 

<b>Window Controls.</b>
Sort of power windows.
Yes, I believe that is the way Dodge markets the power window package to consumers. Front windows, Power, rear windows, not power. You must roll them down yourself. Is that old school or what? I have never seen a car half power, half manual. That is crazy.

<b>Window Controls, part 2.</b>
Want to roll down the windows Miss driver? Well, then get your leg out of the way! In order to reach the power window control, you must reach forward along the left, after moving your left leg out of the way. There is no way I can touch the controls without moving my leg. I am 100% certain this car was designed and built before anyone ever sat in it to test the controls.

<b>Power Locks.</b>
Not bad, but not durable either. The little control breaks off.

<b>Mirrors.</b>
They reflect. They work. They cover almost the entire car, so that there is no blind spot. 

<b>Windshield.</b>
It stops the wind, you look out it. Yay!

<b>Defrost.</b> 
Works well, if you have ice on your windows. I hated scraping the windows so much I decided to park it in my garage. They don't get ice on them now.

<b>POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

Yes, the time you've been waiting for, the ENGINE review. 

Boasting a <b>2 liter single overhead cam, 4 cylinder engine</b>, I looked with scorn upon the tiny engine.
I am a believer in very light car to decent power ratio now.

132 horsepower engine. This sounds incredibly wimpy to me. But the NEON is so lite, it takes off with this engine. Seriously, I think the 0-60 time was somewhere around the 9-10 second range. Not bad for something so inexpensive, and built for economy. But 0-60 doesn't matter much to me. 60 is to slow. It's the higher speeds I'm interested in. How is it from 65 to 90? Sometimes you just need to pass someone as quick as you can. Well, the NEON can do this if you catch the person unaware. The NEON actually has neck snapping power. Actually I believe this is caused by the transmission jumping in and out of different gears, grasping for power wherever it gets it from. The car literally lurches forward a few times during pedal to the floor acceleration when you want to go from 65 to the mid 80s. 

<b>120 miles per hour speedometer!</b>
I laughed at that. Yeah, right, like the NEON can get to 120.
In all honesty, I believe it can, if given an extremely long stretch of flat (or downhill) empty pavement. I have only brought it to 110, and it took it's own sweet time getting there once it passed 100. I only wish I had a tachometer in this car so I could see the tiny engine putting out an enormous amount of RPMS. I turned the radio down to hear the engine, and it sounded like it was screaming. I half expected a piston to fly through the hood. 

<b>NOISE</b>
The NEON is not meant to be pushed at high speed. It gets VERY loud. The only way to solve this is to turn up the stupid radio louder. Forget about driving with the window open and holding a conversation. You'd have to scream at the passenger.

<b>Trunk Space.</b>
Hardly enough room to store large cases which hold guns in them. I found this to be a problem. The trunk just isn't that wide. It is however, deep, and you can drop the backseats to increase cargo area, but then you can't carry backseat passengers.

<b>Backseat. </b>
Tiny. Don't store adults back there. Store midgets, dwarves, munchkins, little people, vertically challenged, and Ewoks, ONLY.

<b>Driving the NEON.</b>
I have found there to be a rather large amount of vibration feedback into the steering wheel at average highway speeds. By that I mean below 75. But If I take the NEON over 75 the vibrations all but go away. The vibrations are very pronounced, and annoying. 

<b>ARM RESTS.
POOR DESIGN!</b>
There is really nowhere to comfortably rest your arms. 

Seats are comfy enough. They recline. They are not all that soft, but offer support. The support is needed when you're throwing the NEON through the corners. 

<b>GAS MILEAGE!</b>
The NEON is said to get 28 miles per gallon city, and 35 highway. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT'S A LIE! A BOLD FACED LIE!
When driven in the 80s and 90mph range the NEON is lucky to get 25 mpg. It also seems like I am constantly at gas stations. The little thing only has a 12.5 gallon gas tank. I feel like the guy with the small bladder at the bar.

The Neon is a good little car, but there is no doubt in my mind this car will not last if driven the way I have just described. If you're a slow driver, who accelerates at a medium pace, and drives about the city most of the time, you'll be fine. But no way will the NEON last long if you're hammering the gas at every stoplight. 

The new 2001 Dodge NEON is available with a MAGNUM engine, putting out 150 horsepower, equipped with sport suspension, and 16 inch wheels. That car should be fun to drive. But there is just something inherently wrong about a MAGNUM NEON.<br><br>
