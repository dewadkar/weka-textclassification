            Having used the Fuji FinePix 4700 for nearly a year, I was interested to see if the FinePix 6800 improved some of the short-comings in that otherwise fine camera. I'm happy to see they've had. One of my biggest beefs with the 4700 was the lack of autopreview in auto mode. This has been corrected with the 6800.
  Much is made about the F.A. Porsche-designed body, but it really isn't that different from the FinePix 4700. It's slightly larger, rounder and chunkier, but not in a bad way. The 4700 is eminently pocketable, but the 6800 is only slightly less so.
  The Fuji FinePix 6800 is a really a multimedia machine: it makes still pictures, digital movies with audio clips and audio-only clips. Unlike the 4700, which had a more-cumbersome LCD display and knob placement, the 6800 handles this quite easily.
  In another breakthough in usability, the 6800 can also be used as PC camera, once it's loaded into the docking station. This USB dock also recharges the battery. 
  The only trouble I've had with the FinePix 6800 is playing back the movies on my PC. They play back fine on the camera itself, but won't play back on my four-year-old PC. Since I used it primarily for stills, however, this was not a big deal for me.
