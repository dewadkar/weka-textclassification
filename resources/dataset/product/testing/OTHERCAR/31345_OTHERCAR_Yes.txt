            Plain and simple, the A4 is a great car. You get a ton of bang for the buck. I ordered one with a few options, they were all good choices. This car has excellent pickup, and has no problem cruising at highway speeds. However, this car is not a good car for long trips, especially if you have back problems. The seats are a little stiff, but overall comfort is acceptable. There is plenty of room for the front passengers, but the back seats are only good for small children. No adult could fit back there comfortably, but the trunk space makes up for the lost seat room. The engine is a pain to work on, so I brought it to the dealer or another European car garage. Caution, the Audi dealer service will leave a hole burning in your wallet. Some annoyances of the car have been brake dust, the cupholders sticking, the odometer flashing &quot;IN1&quot; after it's been serviced because most service centers don't have the reset machine, and various problems with the rear light clusters, the bulbs burn out quickly and the cluster itself has already fallen out. The car has stalled once. This is a very reliable car, if that is one of your prime factors in car-buying. I bought the car because the style just came and grabbed me, and it's very fun to drive, yet practical. To sum it all up, if you're looking for car with plenty of zip and great value, go for the A4, not some Japanese alternative.<br><br>
