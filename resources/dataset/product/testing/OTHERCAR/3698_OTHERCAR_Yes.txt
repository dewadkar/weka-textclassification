            When I was on the search for a new car, it was a very tough decision to make. I was down sizing from a minivan, and I had two children. I wanted a compact car, but was worried about it sitting a family of four comfortably. 
      There are many makes and models to choose from and I wanted to make sure I made the right choice, and not be sorry after it was all said and done.  I knew that the was a very good car but I wanted to explore all my options and not just settle for something.
I took various types of cars for test drives but I still had my heart set on a Honda. I mean they last forever. The Honda I took for a test drive I feel in love with because it rode very smooth. I also took my whole family (all four of us) so that I can see how comfortable we were on the test drive. I couldn't believe how much room my kids still had in the back seat. 
   We were sold!! We decided to go with the 4 door Honda Civic. We purchased a silver one that had automatic transmission. The only thing I'm not thrilled about was the 4 cylinder engine, however this little car has some zip to it and accelerates very well.
    It has been about 10 months since we purchased the Honda Civic and I have to say that I am quite happy with it. We have gone on many long drives with it with no problems at all.
    I think that this is a great little car and anyone who is looking for a new car should consider it without a second thought. 
    We have even gotten lots of compliment from people off the street saying "how nice and classy our car looked." One person even said "from the front it looks like a BMW."
     The warranty on the car is wonderful as we got the extended warranty of 100,000 miles or 10 year plan. Also on the oil changes our dealer pays for every other oil change. Now I'm not sure if that is true with every dealership but I thought that it was a great little added bonus. 
    Anyhow I highly recommend the Honda Civic and hope this review helps in your car buying decision.
