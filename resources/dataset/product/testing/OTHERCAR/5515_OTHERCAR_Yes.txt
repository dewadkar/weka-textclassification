            I have to admit that I'm a sucker for "miniature" stuff--and this camera sucked me right in.  I was hesitant about purchasing it because I was afraid that I would be disappointed in the quality, but now that I've used it for several weeks, I am very impressed with how this camera performs.

One thing I do need to clarify is that I bought this camera at Costco as a package--it also came with a Sony Photoprinter--so the price I paid is not 100% accurate.  The whole package was $199.97 for both items.

The biggest selling point with this camera is size.  It really looks like a spy camera, and it fits nicely in a pocket or a purse.  I can see where this will come in very handy when traveling, or for someone who likes to have a camera with them at all times.  I can honestly say that I've taken several pictures with it that I wouldn't have before because I wouldn't have had a camera with me.  

Picture quality is extremely good when taken in the higher resolution.  The low resolution is fine for e-mailing, or printing wallet size prints, but I am in the habit of just leaving mine on the higher resolution.  The compression of the files is rather high, but doesn't seem to affect picture quality much if at all, and makes it much more convenient and fast if you upload these files to a photo printing service.  With a 128 MB memory card you can get around 250 pictures on it, so you don't have to lug a lot of cards around with you either.  Unfortunately they only give you an 8 MB card with the camera, so you almost have to purchase an additional card. 

The flash isn't great, but works well in average conditions.  You can't use it to take a picture of someone clear across a room, but with a camera like this, why would you want to?  Keep it under 6 feet, and it works great.  If they had put a flash that went any further than 6 feet, the whole camera would have to be bigger which completely defeats the purpose!  I especially liked the smaller flash when taking pictures of my miniature Christmas village, it doesn't wash everything out like a larger flash would.  

No zoom lens, but once again, that would make it a bigger camera and that's not the idea here.  The optics are very good, and I didn't have any trouble using the LCD viewfinder, although it did take a bit of getting used to the fact there is no optical viewfinder.  Reviewing pictures you've taken is easy, as is deleting files you don't wish to keep.  

This is probably one of the fastest cameras as far as powering up, it's ready within a couple of seconds, depending on what flash mode you have it in.  It writes the files to the memory card extremely fast too, so you aren't missing out on a lot of great shots while you wait.  The menus are easy to learn and use, and it comes with a nice selection of special effects generally only seen on more complicated digital cameras.  

The camera seems to be very well made, and I especially like the fact that it has the clamshell design lens cover, no worries about losing anything.  Just slide it back and you are ready to take pictures.  All finished--slide it over the lens and pop it in your purse.  No worries about a scratched lens and it shuts everything down, no battery drain because you forgot to turn it off.  About the only thing missing on the body that I would have liked is a tripod mount, but once again, this probably would have affected the size of the camera.

Another big plus on this camera is the fact that it takes standard AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries, easily found at your local Walmart or other discount store.  The downside is it takes 13 hours to charge them with the supplied charger, so I recommend buying extra batteries as backups and/or buying a rapid charger to cut the time.  It also won't let you use AAA alkaline or lithium batteries in a pinch, you risk damaging the camera if you do.  Apparently alkaline & lithium batteries have a different power output than NiMH. The batteries seem to last an average amount of time though, I generally get between 75 - 100 pictures on a charged set, depending on the circumstances.

The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and use, making transfer of pictures from camera to computer a snap.  I personally prefer a card reader for doing this which also saves on battery drain.

The only serious disappointment in this camera is the movie mode.  The quality isn't that great, and there is no sound, so I don't know why they even bothered.  I suppose it would be fun if you wanted to send movie snippets via e-mail, but for me this was just a wasted feature.  If this is an important feature for you, this is not the camera you want.

Overall, I really like this camera.  It would be a great camera for someone just getting started in digital photography, or for someone who wants to take a camera with them everywhere.  I think it would be an awesome camera for someone who is in to skiing, biking, or hiking as it is lightweight and takes up very little space.  

If you are seriously thinking about this camera, I say go for it--but instead of getting this particular model, get the DSC-U30 which is the newer version.  Overall it is the same camera, but it has an expanded shutter range, giving you more flexibility in unusual lighting situations.  That alone to me would be worth the few extra dollars it might cost.
