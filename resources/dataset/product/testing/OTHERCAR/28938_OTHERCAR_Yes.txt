            First I would like to thank you my reader for taking the time to my opinion. My opinion is about my little car. It is a 1988 Mazda 323 Hatch back 5 speed. All I can say is that I love it. I am 19 and my parents gave me the car when I was 17 because I got all A's on my report card. Before I had it my mom had it as a comuter car and before that my step dad used as a comuter car. When I got the car it had about 150,000 miles on it It came with air and a radio. My mom bought the car for 2,000 dollars because she worked at the mazda dealership and still does so needless to say I get my car worked on for free and I can get parts really easy. My car is the best i hardly ever get anything fixed on it because i am just lazy, I have since lost my air but all i need is a fan. Here again I'm just lazy. But I have put in a CD player and I have mastered the art of breaking into my car because I always lock my keys in there and I can Jump start it like no other because I don't have a little dinging thing that goes off until I turn them off. I also love the way my car drives it my be old but it hauls ass. the good thing about that is that cops dont think that a car like mine can go that fast so they usually pull over the nice looking cars before they do mine. <br>the bad thing about my car is that it makes a funny noise when you take your foot off the gas and don't push in the clutch, my reasoning that I tell my mom is that it dosen't like to go slow. But the noise has been there for like 2 years and nothing is broken and it hasen't blown up yet so it's all good. Now as we approch my cars 12th birthday it has 257,000 and some change, miles. Thats right folks 257,000 + miles and it keeps going. It is a lot happier now that I got my alignment done after it being off for two years. The guy that did it asked if I ran over as many curbs as possible and my reply only like 3.  Thats right it is a tank on wheel with steel enforced bumpers, trust me they saved me a lot of time. <br>Now I know what you are thinking Piece of junk it's probably all dented but it is not you cant even tell I gotten hit in the back and the front. but on the other people you can HAHAHA never pick on the little cars.  <br><br><br>
