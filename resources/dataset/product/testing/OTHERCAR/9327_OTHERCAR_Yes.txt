            My husband knew I wanted a mini van to cart around Girl Scouts.  We found out that our Credit Union had a repossession for sale and we took it for a test drive.  I loved it.  It had 100,000 miles already but the ride was smooth, it handled well and it fit my needs.  The seats all come out except the front two and you can mix and match which you want to leave in.  I have had my 1990 for two years now and have had no major work done to it.  It has taken me from Washington state to North Carolina and back through Texas.  We have gone from the northern edge of Washington to Reno and back, and down the Oregon Coast.  I live in the country so it has to cover a lot of distance to get to any major shopping.  I never thought I would by an Olds, but I love this van.<br><br>
