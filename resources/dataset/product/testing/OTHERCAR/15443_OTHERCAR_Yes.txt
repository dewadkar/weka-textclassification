            Mavica FD-88 has been &quot;Left Behind&quot; by Sony's digital camera new technology.  Floppy disk adapters are NOT available for the FD-88 (the adapter works with FD-85 &amp; FD-90).  

I have had the Sony Mavica FD-88 for nearly one year and it has been very enjoyable.  There are many great features:
- Simple to operate
- Sturdy, durable housing
- Optional photo imaging (i.e., B&amp;W, Negative)
- 16x Precision digital Zoom
- Beautiful picture quality
- No software needed
- Movie feature is great (records audio as well)
- Best of all, it uses floppy disks!

Now the bad news:
- Usually 4-5 pictures per 1.44-MB disk
- Comes with the lesser of two possible rechargeable batteries (but you can buy the better battery)
- Sort of slow when accessing disk (they may all be slow, I have only used this one)
- Sony did NOT make a COMPATIBLE FLOPPY DISK ADAPTER, therefore Sony Memory Sticks CANNOT BE USED!

When I purchased the Sony Mavica FD-88, I envisioned taking a few pics here &amp; there.  However, I really like digital imaging so I find myself taking pics everywhere!  1.44-MB floppy disks have been great, but I have to carry my camera case and a bag of 100 disks.  It would be wonderful to have the option of using a 32-MB or 64-MB Memory Stick.  Too bad Sony left my camera out in their new technology!  If the FD-88 was not considered 'top of the line' in digital cameras, I would understand Sony's neglect.  But I assumed (yikes!) that the Mavica FD-88 was one of their best. Why give a lesser model the floppy disk adapter?

So...you have a pile of disks stashed in your desk because you have switched to CDs.  Use them!  Grab a 100 disks when you go to visit family &amp; friends during the holidays...take pictures of their kids, pets, &amp; homes...give them the disk!  Mavica imbeds a bit of info on each floppy so you can view pics on any computer without downloading special software. 
 
It is great for insurance claims!  Lightening hit one of my oak trees and I e-mailed digital pictures to my insurance company immediately.
Birds bathing at the park were unsuspecting when I zoomed in and photographed their bath.

If Sony can't provide a floppy adapter for this camera, I can't imagine many people wanting to buy it.  Once a consumer gets in the groove of using regular disks in their digital camera, they may find situations where less is better (trade nearly 50 floppy disks for one floppy disk adapter with a memory stick).
