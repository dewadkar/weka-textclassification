            Need a BIG car?  This is it!!  This car has the trunk space your looking for.  The car, listed as a five passenger, is actually comfortable for four adults on a trip, along with all the luggage in the trunk.  This is an excellent tripster. Five adults around town would be fine. At 4200 Lbs this car is heavy, the suspension is a little tight.  The car is capable, quick excelleration, 335 torque, 5.7L 260 Hp V8.  The stiff suspension gives the car the ability to corner very well. Want an exec. sedan that will move?  This is it!!  Want one that will really move??  Add about $2,000. in after market components and this car will give a V8 sport car trouble.  This is a fun car without the additions, but I put the additions on mine and it is a riot.  This car is fast, stable, agile, and comfortable all in one package and it has the stopping power to handle all this with ease.  I would and have, recommended this car to everyone.  Little old ladies might not like the tight suspension, but I am a little old man and I love it!!
