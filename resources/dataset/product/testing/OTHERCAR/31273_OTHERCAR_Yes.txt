            I recently sold my 1995 Grand Am, so I thought I would post my opinions on it quick. In early 1996 I purchased it from a dealer with 3000 miles on it, it was clean and ran great. I didn't have an trouble other than road noise and rattles (which started around 10,000 miles) until I got to about 60,000 miles when the wheel bearings went bad, that cost about $150 to do myself and wasn't too terribly hard. At about 65,000 miles the shocks and struts went bad, that was around $380 to replace at the shop. The next problem I had was the water pump which went out around 75,000 miles. The cost for this fix was around $380 at the shop. After that, it ran pretty well. I did have a coolant leak around 100,000 miles, but all I had to do was replace the radiator cap... about $6. The next thing that went bad was the passenger side lock. Mine had power door locks and that one broke... cost was $100 for the shop to replace it. All in all it was a good running car and I can't complain since I am not that easy on vehicles. I went through about 3 sets of tires and about the same on brake pads. The body and motor held out very well. Lots of city and highway driving (mostly highway) and I did change the oil every 3000 miles which probably helped a lot. The interior held up well except on the floor of the driver side which developed a wear mark from my size 12 shoe... I never was able to get rid of the squeeks and other miscellaneous noices from the dashboard area, but I guess I just got used to it after a while. Gas mileage at 119,000 was about 26.3 MPG after my final repair of replacing the fuel filter. Oh, that reminds me... I also replaced something else fuel related at around 60,000 miles but I can't remember what it was. I'll update this if I recall it. All in all it wasn't a bad car and rather inexpensive to drive. Put it this way, I've never had any other vehicle as long as I had my Grand Am. I now have a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 4x4 which I posted a review on as well. If you're going to buy a Grand Am, make sure these repairs have been done, or at least be aware of them.
