            Approximately 1 year ago I leased my first SUV, a Mountineer. I've been very impressed with it overall. There have been a couple of recalls, but nothing major. Nothing has &quot;fallen apart&quot; on it.

As this is my first SUV, I'm not entirely sure how to compare it other than to say once you drive an SUV you may never be satisfied with a regular car again. The cargo space is absolutely wonderful! (I could probably park my previous car in the back)

I use this car frequently for transporting clients, (clients who usually drive expensive luxury vehicles) and all have been thoroughly pleased with the roominess and luxury of the vehicle overall. The step-up height is not too terrible, even for those who might have difficulty getting around. It is very easy to drive and enjoyable to ride in. Definitely not what one might call a &quot;truck&quot;. I would definitely get it fully loaded. The embroidered leather seats and high quality CD sound system are an excellent value!<br><br>
