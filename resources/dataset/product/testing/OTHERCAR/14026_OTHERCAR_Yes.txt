            Early in 1998 I began my research on the internet for cars.  I wanted a compact or smaller because my work commute is 30 miles one way.  I wanted the best deal on gas mileage.  After thoroughly checking out 6 manufacturers, I decided to go with Pontiac.  The SunFire's wheel base is a tad longer than the rest, which helps to make a smoother ride.

Went online to Sam's club to see about pricing.  Sam's found me a dealer that was betwen home and work, making it convenient if I had to bring the car in to the shop.

Called the dealer, they did not have the car in stock, but they found one, and I picked it up 2 days later.   Boy, did that make my life easier, not having to run around looking at dealers and trying to get the best price.

Picked up the car on Saturday morning, and immediately left for a trip to Wisconsin, about 90 miles north.  Had to check out the ride and it was fantastic.  So smooth, you did not know you were going fast.  The 15 inch tires on the Sunfire hold to the road very well.  The ride is very quiet.  You think you are in a much larger vehicle.  The Sunfire has a large trunk for a compact car, you can stuff it with 3 or 4 suitcases.

All in all you get more value for your money with the Sunfire, even better than her sister vehicle (not naming brands).  When purchasing any vehicle, be sure and check out the specs and compare with other models.
