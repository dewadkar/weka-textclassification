            I acquired my Prizm my senior year in high school, back in 1993.  My dad took me to a used car lot and gave me the choice of 3 cars there - the Prizm, a Ford Escort, and a Ford (?) Topaz.  I remember immediately loving the style of the Prizm.  Then I test drove it.  That was it - I told my dad that it was the one.   His main concern was getting me a car that would be dependable for me in college, especially on the 11-hour trip from my hometown to my college.  My dad struck a deal with the car lot owner that, essentially, gave us my car for free - sort of.  My dad is a paving contractor and offered to repave the owner's lot (a tiny lot) as payment for the car.  It worked.  I got a nice dependable Prizm, the car lot owner got nice new asphalt.  :)  Anyway, that basically says that I can't really tell you how much the car cost to purchase.

Like another one of the reviewers of this car, my car lived it's previous existence as a rental car.  It only had 19,000 miles on it when I got it.  Despite being only a year old at the time, several of the interior trim pieces were broken - the air conditioning vents, the hazard light button, etc., and the upholstery had some cigarette burns.  I attributed this to the fact that it had been a rental, thus driven by many drivers who probably didn't take too much car, since it wasn't their car.  In the 8 years that I have had this car, well, I've come to notice that the interior is just that cheap.  I've had lots of plastic accessories break off, a few of which had to be replaced, such as the inside door handles (note that I said handles - plural).  The fabric on the roof is now falling down, too.

As for dependability and reliability - I am so happy to have had such as dependable car!!!  Few problems have occurred while I've had it, and only in recent years, as my car has aged a bit.  I've had to have the starter and the alternator replaced.  It has developed a few strange rattles and such in recent years, too.

As for general get-up-and-go qualities, well, it does lack in that area.  It's zippy, but not fast.  I've never tested to see what it's top speed was.  It tends to make a slight "you're pushing me too hard" growl when you hit 74 miles per hour, but none the less, I've driven it in the 80's before.

My husband is 6' 2", and he has, until the roof fabric started falling, been able to sit comfortably in the front seat.  The fabric now brushes against his hair and irritates him.  The seats in the back are tiny.  It's definately not meant for adults in the back.  Kids maybe, but I feel sorry for all the adults that I have to seat back there.  

Okay, and one final thing that I can think of - don't get the light blue metallic color!  Mine, which was light blue metallic, started peeling BADLY, until the whole hood was bare.  We had to get it repainted.  When I went to the paint shop, I was told that the light blue paint that was used during those years was prone to peeling.  They've apparently reformulated the paint for later models.
