            I received a 1991 GMC Safari GT in Dec. of 96, it had 91,000 mi on it. Today it has 143,000 mi. Over the course of 50k+ mi miles that i have put on it, i have spent just over 1500$ maintenance. I had a leaky exhaust manifold gasket replaced around 120k. The engine runs around 220 deg. normal, a little high for me. Items that I have replaced myself: alternator 120$, engine belt 30$ , brakes 26$, interior lamps 5$, oxygen sensor 14$, tires cost about 70-90$ a piece, 215/65 r16, head light 10$ a pop..... Other than those costs it has been a great van. very heavy duty.... rides like a truck.... great family trip taker. ......... I just wish GMC would locate the engine for easier access. I still own it, and will continue to. This van is built to function as a truck, so if you want a car in a van look elsewhere<br><br>
