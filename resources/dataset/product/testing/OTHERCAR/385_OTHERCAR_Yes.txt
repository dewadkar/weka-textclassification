            What more can be said about this vehicle:

a 3.3 litre single overhead cam engine... this vehicle blows all others away in it's price point....  

a frame that is taller and wider than a Nissan Pathfinder... utilizing the same engine... rugged, tough and diverse...

Three Trim Options.... Xe I4, XE V-6, and the SE V-6 all at very competitive prices... I especially prefer the loaded SE v6 with the flip top sun roof...

Wet/dry utility basket that is removable...

A price tag that is very competitive....

A back to basics automobile... a test drive will show you that you can go on the town or off the beaten path.... a host of accessories including waterproof seat covers...

You cannot find a better buy for a Sport Utility Vehicle... It has the quality of Nissan, w/ a proven engine, a dynamic chassis and a low cost of ownership..<br><br>
