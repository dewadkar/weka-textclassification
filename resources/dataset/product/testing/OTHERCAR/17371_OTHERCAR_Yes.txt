            My husband and I bought my Toyota Extended cab pick up new in 1991. It was the first time we had ever bought a new vehicle, we always bought them used. 
My truck has yet to have a tune-up, and still runs like a dream. We have kept the oil changed, but that is the extent of work that has been done to it.
It has all the power one would want in a pick-up. I have hauled loads of sand and dirt for our landscaping business, and it hauled it with ease. The ride is smooth for it to be a small size pick-up. It has been wrecked and fixed twice now, and still holding up.
I would recommend a Toyota to anyone looking for a vehicle. They are durable, and well worth the price.<br><br>
