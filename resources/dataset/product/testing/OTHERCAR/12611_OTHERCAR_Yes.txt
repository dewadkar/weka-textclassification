            The Powershot S10 is a super digital camera. I have been using mine now for about six months. I bought it at a highly trusted camera store. After looking at all of the models available in the same price range I decided on this one. One of the main reasons was it's high quality of picture and the easy transfer of the image to the computer. 
It stores the pictures till I want to upload them to the computer. This camera came with the software for Powershot browser and also included Photodeluxe with it. With these two programs one can do anything with this little camera. It is better than the kind that stores images on a disc as the discs hold so little memory that soon you have no room for more photos. As soon as I upload pictures they are erased and I have room for more. 
The quality of the pictures is excellent. I have taken pictures of  pictures a seemingly impossible thing and they have worked well. 
The one draw back if there is one, is the need for the battery charger. It is not included in the box but is needed. Other wise the batteries will run down to quickly. 
I use this for professional use as well as private fun use. I think anyone who wanted a small easy to carry camera with a perfect picture should use this one. Easy to use and it works well. <br><br>
