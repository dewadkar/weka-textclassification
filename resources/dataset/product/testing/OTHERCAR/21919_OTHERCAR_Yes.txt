            This is my 2nd BMW and I must say it's been nothing but a pleasure driving it for all these years. I first bought a 318is(1991) and was a bit disappointed. A lot of things went wrong with that car. Then I stepped up to a 525 and was the best thing I had ever done.
 I bought it in 1992 and to this day it still drives like the first day I bought it. I've had minimal problems and when I do the BMW dealerships treat you like you're the most important person in the world.
 My plan was to spend a lot up front for a great car so I could keep it for a long time,and it has worked. The car still looks stylish,still drives great, and I have no desire to buy another one because the car looks outdated or giving me a lot of problems. If you can afford to shell out the money up front you will win on the back end. BUY CHEAP,BUY TWICE.
 I plan on driving this car for another 10 years. 
 Change the oil,find a good mechanic, and you can avoid car payments for years after this car is paid for.
 Happy Driving!<br><br>
