<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>Comfort is great.  Its not quite a BMW or Mercedes but then again it doesnt cost as much as one.  As far as features it matches the competition.  All power items, auto dimming mirrors, good stereo, automatic climate control, power seats, moonroof.  Interior materials dont quite match European and Japanese offerings but functionality is excellent.  If you want gizmos and wood all over spend the extra 10 grand+ for the mechanically identical Jaguar S-type.<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>This is the high point of the car.  For less then 40,000 you get a V8 and a 5 speed auto manual.  The suspension is tight, the ride firm but not jarring.  It doesnt quite ride like a BMW but it will out-corner all of them exept the M3.  The V8 is smooth (same as the Jaguar less a couple HP) The transmission works well and for more control you can do it yourself.  Merging with this car is fun and its precise steering feel (again its no BMW but its real good) make the backroads a lot of fun.<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>Airbags, Safety cage, Good seatbelts, not to mention its nearly 4000lbs.  Our Lincoln was hit in the rear door by an explorer. Barely felt it.  <br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>Overall its a great car.  If you want a european sedan and dont have 50,000+ for a V8 this is a great car.  It handles wonderfully accelerates very quickly (sounds good too) and does everything quietly.  Ive gotten many compliments from strangers asking me what it was and if I liked it.  I reccomend black with the sport package.  The interior space is perfect for me.  Seats 4 adults comfortably.  Servicing is also great.  After owning several european sedan i'm surprised each time I look at service bills, its like owning a bmw and paying the service for a ford escort.  Ive had no major mechanical problems (currently I have 17,000 miles on it).  The only real complaints are is the lack of storage space and cheapness of the interior.  All the controls are easy to use and find but they dont have the feel of my Volvo S80 or Infiniti.  Of course when Im chasing mustangs on the backroads I dont care if I have woodgrain glove box handles.  I enjoy the in dash 6 cd changer and the air conditioning has performed flawlessly.  On the highway it feels like a vault.  Quiet but connected.  Right between BMW and Lexus.  There is only one way to get this car if you are under 65.  SPORT PACKAGE.<br>
If you want this car but want a little more flash and a true luxury name get the jaguar s-type.  Its the same car but with a jaguar exterior and interior.  Be prepared to bring along a fat wallet.  You will pay 10-20 thousand premium for that wood, leather and crome.  Personally ill take that extra cash and pickup a Ford Focus.  5 stars  <br><br>
