            When we were in the market for a just-out-of-college-and-married car, we had several ideas about what we wanted.  Something mid-sized, good gas mileage, large enough for us to sit comfortably, etc.  We originally had our eyes on a new Honda Accord, and although the dealer we dealt with was wonderful, the price was still a little too high.  Used Accords are few and far between, so we expanded our options.  I'm so glad we did.
  We were fortunate to find a 98 Nissan Altima GLE with low miles and in very good shape.  It was exactly what we were looking for.  On top of being a blast to drive, it handles really well with the 15&quot; tires that come standard.  The gas mileage is good for the size of car(~25-30 mpg), and the engine will really get up and go.  The designers really utilized the space well for the family-size trunk without taking space away from the interior.  The driver's seat is automated, as is the antenna, which is very nice.  
  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the color.  Golden olive just didn't appeal to me at first, but we've had several compliments on it. It's growing on me.  
  The field of view is limited out the front windshield when the visors are down, which is kind of annoying.  Also, the visors are very small and do not shield the sun very well.  Bring sunglasses instead.    
  I would recommend this car for parents looking for a car for their college student, for young single people or couples.  It's a great buy but still a good, safe car.  I wouldn't recommend it necessarily for larger families or parents with older children wanting a family car, even though the backseat is relatively large.  <br><br>
