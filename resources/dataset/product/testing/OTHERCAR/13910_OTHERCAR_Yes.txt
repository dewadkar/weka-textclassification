            I have driven a 2001 SC2 for 4 months. It is very peppy and fun to drive. My teenage son and his girlfriends all love it (when I let him drive it). 

This is my second Saturn, the first one is 8 years old, has 102,000 miles on it and lives with my daughter at Univ. of Hawaii.

I like Saturns BUT.......  they have alot of little plastic parts that seem to fall off, crack and break periodically. I have replaced the cup holder, ceiling light, seat belt retainers, center island CD box, seat adjustment handle and trunk lock mechanism on the 8 year old. The 2001 has already experienced broken windshield washer spray nozzles and a panel inside the driver compartment at the center console down by the right foot that refuses to stay in place. I have no doubt my son will lose this panel or break it in the near future.

The replacement costs for the parts are exorbitant: for example the replacement plastic cup holder for the 8 year old is $69. 

For the last 5 years the 8 year old uses a quart of oil every 1000 miles, which Saturn tells me is &quot;Normal&quot;. I've replaced the clutch, water pump and battery. Overall I've gotten my money's worth.<br><br>
