            For an outstanding value on a sporty two-door coupe, the Chevrolet Monte
Carlo is hard to beat.  I'm 6'2, 240 lbs., and the seats and their
positioning are quite comfortable.  Also have 2 children, ages 11 and 8,
more back seat room than the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry coupes.  With
the Z-34 package, it can really move down the highway!  After looking at the aforementioned competition, the Monte Carlo priced thousands less.
Has been trouble-free so far.<br><br>
