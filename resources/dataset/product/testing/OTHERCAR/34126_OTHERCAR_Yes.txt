            We purchased a 1995 Nissan 240SX in the Spring of 1996.  We bought it because we were trading in our 1987 Peugot to have a newer auto with some type of warranty.  Upon seeing the car on the lot my wife said &quot;I want THAT!&quot;  Visually, it's a very nice on the eyes.  We paid around $16k for it and it had under 2,000 miles on it (program car from the dealership).  

We test drove it and were impressed at the responsiveness of the car.  When you press on the gas pedal.....you WILL be moved!  You have more than ample power to accelerate out of dangerous situations or just to zoom around a slow-poke on the highway.  Cornering and handling are really nice because it has stabilizers and really good suspension.  Because it's lower to the ground it doesn't tilt as much as it's taller counterpart the Maxima when cornering (I've driven one before).  Anti-lock brakes weren't standard when we purchased ours so we opted not to have them after the test drive because the car is so responsive that you can literally &quot;yank&quot; on the steering wheel in a sticky situation and not lose any control of the car (provided you know how to handle a car in this manner at high speeds).  Oh yeah, this car has a very small U-turn radius.

Side-impact steel beams in the doors have saved my life!  I was hit in the driver's side by a Ford Expedition, spun 180 degrees and slammed into and up onto a curb.  Thank goodness I had the window down....  The door was indented about 6 inches and was barely touching my shoulder.  I walked away from that accident unharmed.  When my wife looked at the car after it was towed to the body shop, she gasped at how the outside of the car looked.  We'll never by a car without side-impact steel beams in the doors because of that incident.

Rear-wheel drive has caused us problems a few times.  Living in TX means we don't have much snow, but we do get ice frequently during the winter and this car performed horribly!  I tried to back out of the garage and slid down a hill unceremoniously until a Jeep came to the rescue and towed our sleek-looking car to safety.  Unless you plan on packing your trunk w/ sandbags, this is not a winter automobile.

Trunk size is really good.  Engine is built extremely well.  We have a '98 Dodge Neon that has been to the shop more than 10 times (found out it had a cracked head).  We've only recently taken the 240 in to service a faulty mass air-flow meter (350 bucks).  That's after 5 years.  

We are currently looking to trade it in for a minivan because we have 2 children under age 3 and it's like packing ourselves into sardine can to get everyone in.  Although I will add that we sometimes prefer to use the 240SX versus the Dodge Neon because it handles better and has the steel beams in the doors.  I mean the car seats aren't that big, but the back seats are there for lowering your insurance not for people to actually sit in.  This is really a 2-person car.  I'll even go further to say that if you're near 6' tall, you're going to have issues getting in and out.<br><br>
