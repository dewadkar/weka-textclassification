            My boyfriend and I purchased this camera a couple weeks ago. I already have my own digital camera, an AGFA ePhoto 20Cl, but this is a better quality camera than my older one and it is one that we can share. I recommend this camera because it has a very high resolution capacity which results in a good quality picture. You can choose how many photos you would like stored at once based on their resolution, so if you need a bunch of so-so pictures you can take many, or if you need a few very good quality pictures you can take just those. My favorite feature on this camera is its viewing lense that lets you see the picture close up before you take it. This results in a picture that is exactly the one you wanted to take. It also has a photo gallery that allows you to view all the pictures you have stored so far, as well as delete any you no longer need in order to make room for more before uploading them. This feature is not included on my older digital camera and I like it because if I accidentally take a wrong or bad picture I don't have to worry about it taking up space on the camera that could go for another picture; I just delete it and take another picture. I also don't have to worry about being at my computer and uploading the pictures just to see which ones I have taken so far.  I also like the basic design as well as compact shape of this camera.

There are two things I do not like about this camera. The first is that it only connects to the computer via serial port and not USB. The second problem is related to the first because since the camera only has a serial cable to connect with, the uploading time is much slower than if it could connect by USB. My other AGFA camera can upload all its pictures relatively quickly, but this one takes a lot longer. However, with my other camera I have to wait seven seconds between each picture I take and with this one I do not, so I guess it is a trade-off.

We bought this camera on ubid.com so it was a lot cheaper than the regular price. (Our winning bid was $100 plus shipping costs, for a brand new camera).  At the price I bought it for, I definitely recommend this camera. However, at full price I am not sure it is worth it. It would be better to buy a cheaper AGFA camera, such as the 20Cl, and save over one hundred dollars for almost the same features. However, the cheaper kind does not come with a viewing lense or gallery so if you think that is worth the extra 100 or so, go ahead. At the ubid.com or other discounted price, I definitely recommend this version of the AGFA camera over others, but at full price, I am not so confident about its value vs. cost when compared to others.
