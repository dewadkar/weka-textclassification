            I was lucky enough to receive this little gem as a gift just before we went on vacation last fall to Mystic, CT.  Unfortunately, three hours out of the box, the power off/on switch broke.  Of course the internet dealer wouldn't take it back, so it was mailed off to Sony a state away.  Fortunately, there were no hassles involved here.  They had it back to me the Friday before I started vacation.  It was pretty easy to figure out except for the night shots; I love to get the moon over the ocean shots and I still don't do very well with those.  There are many settings I don't understand, such as all the 'AE' stuff with the plus and minus numbers.  I purchased an extra 8MB memory stick and an extra battery.  I don't think I'll live long enough to use the extra battery though.  If you just make the small size pictures such as for e-mailing, you'll do fine and have lots of room for many pictures.  I enjoyed filling the first memory stick, putting it away and filling the other.  You do need to remember when you use the zoom feature you use valuable memory and you don't get as many pics as you normally would. I anticipate this camera will take me way into the future before I need to replace it.  There is a drawback in the bright sun when you're trying to look into the LCD screen...it's not always very easy.  On the whole, I love this camera and use it constantly outside and inside the house.  I need to read the book front to back though in order to be able to use all the features it has.  It was a great investment for us.  I could still use a little guidance in this area so if anyone feels like helping me out, please feel free to e-mail me.  Thanks.                nhnonna in lakeport nh<br><br>
