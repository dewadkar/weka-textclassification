            Used Previas are scarce as hen's teeth.  Ours was the only one in the entire capital city's selection of Toyota dealers in 1998.  I'm conscientious about replacing things that need doing at Toyota, so I;ve spent a fair amount doing shocks, brakes, U-joints, a leaky front seal, and fluid changeouts (diffs, transfer, transmission, coolant).  The dealer "said" they put $800 worth of work into it via new CV boots, platinum plugs, etc. before we bought it.  The rear hatch lock remains open unless I press the electric lock and twist the key simultaneously - needs lubrication and disassembly.

But I put up with all of this because even at 217,000 km so far I know it's going to go another 100,000 without any surprises.  

Recently our viscous coupling in the transfer case seemed to get a little siezed so when we turn tight radius corners the all trac chugs/scuffs the tires like any 4wd truck but the 20 yr. toyota tech said no problems. I'd buy another one but the all-trac isn't available on the Sienna.  It's kind of nice knowing you have a mini-van that was 10 years ahead of its time (now all the Caravans look strangely rounded like the Previas were when they came out in 1991).

As to the comments about lack of power - I'm a family man and if I wanted power I'd have kept my 5.0 L Mustang.  Get it out of your system- gas isn't going to get any cheaper - be happy with the 4 cyl. - and a great engine design at that.  We don't even own the S/C (supercharged) version, and I'm content with power I have - frequently driving 140 km/hr on the lonely country roads around here when I'm in a hurry.  The 4 wheel disc brakes will stop you in a hurry.  The kids love their swiveling reversible captain's chairs
