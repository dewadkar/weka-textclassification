     Everyone always searches for that car that they feel is going to be best for them. Well, I didn't exactly find the best one for me but I did find a good car that I'd go to if necessary. The 1997 Isuzu Rodeo has a nice look to it and is extremely comfortable. A couple of my friends and I rented one for a weekend to take a little road trip.  Before I get into the positives about it, I'll hit you with the one negative I found first.  Now I'm not sure if this was just a certain instance with mine or not but I found that when I slowed down the car began to rock and shake leaving me a little bit confused and worried.  Besides that I found no problems with it at all.  And now, the positives:

~Going on a long journey, I found it to be a comfortable ride.  The last thing you want when going on a trip is to have rock hard seats with no room whatsoever.

~Plenty of room in the trunk.  This allows you to pack what you need without feeling cramped.

~Decent gas mileage for a SUV.  Of course with gas prices skyrocketing the last thing you want is to have to deal with having to fill up the tank every 5 minutes as is often the case with most SUV's.

~A nice look.  Even when I just took it out for the weekend, I still managed to pull off a few compliments from random people that I met.  Not bad when there's so many nice cars out there nowadays.

Well, if you're looking to purchase this car I'd recommend that you definitely consider it, but make sure first that there are no problems with it.  So take a good look at it and go enjoy the ride.
