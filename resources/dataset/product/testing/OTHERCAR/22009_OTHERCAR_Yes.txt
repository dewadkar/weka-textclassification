            Until I experienced the drive and ride of a Lexus LS400, I firmly believed that true luxury only came from Germany.  However, it took me only my first test drive to believe otherwise.
The handling and control was superb, and there was no need to &quot;get used to the car&quot; because it felt great from the beginning.  It accelerated nicely, and its brakes were in good form.  Three major facets of this automobile truly caught my eye: interior, engine performance, and the service that Lexus has for all of its customers.
As you sit yourself down into the driver's seat, the first thing you will probably notice is how comfortable the leather is.  I gently contours itself to your body regardless of who sat in it the time before.  Looking past the steering wheel, you can easily see the road, as Lexus made sure to provide much needed visibility.  The dials and gauges are easy to read in the daylight, but more importantly, they brightly illuminate in the night.  The standard sound system was sufficient, and provided substantial bass, and clarity for any enthusiast.  (They do provide an upgraded Nakamachi system for audiophiles).  The size of the cabin is also very spacious, which allows four adults to comfortably ride long distances.
As said before the engine is in great form, a V8, that can flex its muscles when it needs to.  The V8,however can be a negative, because it will consume more gas than a V6.  However compared to most V8's Lexus' economy is very competitive.  Possibly most surprising, though, is the fact that even though the engine is so powerful, you will not hear it.  This is because Lexus has insulated the car from external noise, and further comforts the ride.
Finally the service of Lexus is amazing.  With free loaner cars, competent mechanics, and friendly salesman, the atmosphere is hard to beat.
So if you are looking for a luxury sedan that will last a long time, keep your mind open for a Lexus LS400.<br><br>
