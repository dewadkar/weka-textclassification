            Well pooey! Someone has written almost exactly the review I would have!  I absolutely love the 780c!  I have not bought any of the extras like rechargeable batteries or an adapter card--YET!  A friend who sells digital cameras kind of scoffed at me wanting to purchase this camera until he saw the quality of a picture taken.  I rarely even use the highest resolution and get some of the most detailed clear pictures..much better than even my 35mm camera. I find it very easy to use, and once you get the hang of the photo program it is a cinch.  Occasionally I find that I need to go in and fix up a picture....usually to make it a bit lighter--I have poor lighting in my house.  But the results when you do that are even good, only takes some of the sharpness out of the picture.  I really would recommend someone buying this camera!  My mom loves receiving pictures I have printed on photo paper in the snail mail and I love not having to pay for the developing only to get a few good shots.  My husband loves that he can delete a photo that didn't come out right--hehe!<br><br>
