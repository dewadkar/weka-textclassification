            After 6 months of narrowing our search down, my husband and I finally decided on the Sienna. We test drove it twice and I sat in the driver's seat on 3 different occasions since I was going to be the primary driver.  I have a bad lower back and have to be picky about car seats.  After sitting in the van 3 times and assured by our Toyota salesman that the seats were orthopedically designed, even though there is no lumbar support, we decided to buy the Sienna. 

After 3 days of commuting to work in the van I noticed my right leg kept going numb if I was in the seat for more than 30 minutes.  Two months later I still have numbness in my right leg whenever I'm in the car for more than 30 minutes at a time.  We also have had it in the shop 3 times over the course of 2 months, each time for the power sliding door and also for a leaky windshield. I do like the smooth ride of the van. 

I am ready to go back to GM at this point!<br><br>
