            Just brought a Warner Brothers Edition of this van last month. It was a nice compromise for the pickup I wanted.
I was drawn to the fact that all five seats could be removed and make room for plywood sheets I would need to haul from the Home Depot to do much needed home renovations. The Camry just was not cutting it for that. After four trips to the Home Depot, I can vouch that the van is admirable for this purpose. I also love the backup system
which warns you with a series of beeps and yellow and red lights when you are approaching an object. Great for parking in downtown Washington DC. Especially for a first time van owner like myself. The nephews and nieces loved the video entertainment system. I even had occasion to use the built in baby seat even though I do not have children myself. I brought an inflatable bed to put in the back for camping or roadtrips. Why not, the van comes equipped with a built in air compressor and blowing up the bed is a snap.

Anyway, I'm not commenting on the technical more important mechanical under pinnings of the vehicle. Reason being that I'm not mechanically inclined and was more drawn to some of the gizmos I just mentioned. I said, in an earlier opinion I wrote regarding the GM credit card, I had to make use of a $3300 credit I had towards a GM vehicle. So I took the plunge and brought an American car. Not to say the Toyota has not had its share of troubles,
a matter I will address on a subsequent opinion. However, at least the Toyota did not act up so early in the game.
Sad to say, I may have to trade in that Venture under lemon law regulations. At 1000 odd miles a "Service Engine Soon" light came on at which point I took it to the dealer. Dealer replaced the entire gas tank. I went on a nine hour trip over the Easter holiday and THE LIGHT went on again. At that point I got to test the Batmobile button or 
On Star button. The representative told me it was an emissions problem and I would have to take the van in for service within seven days. I told her I was 1000 miles from home and would it be save to drive. She said she could run a diagnostic on the engine right then while I was driving which sounds pretty impressive! Her conclusion, which was somewhat predictable even for a novice like myself, was that there was an emissions problem. I asked her if I should seek immediate assistance and she was non committal. I opted to take it to a dealship and they claim they reprogrammed the chip. It worked fine the rest of the trip, or at least the light was not indicating a problem, but this morning that light greeted my day once again. This will be the third tiome into the deaerlship for the same problem .If memory serves me ,they have three strikes under the lemon law to be declared out. I'll keep you all posted.
