            The Lexus LS400, since it's first redesign (IMHO), is and has been great at one thing, perhaps the best:  Luxury value.

For what the car offers, even for the asking price, few can compare in today's market.  Disregarding individuals' emotional concerns such as exterior shape, country of origin, etc., this is certainly an undisputable fact.  And the figures show:  This car is a hot seller in most markets. 

For simplicity's sake, I will be reviewing the latest incarnation of this vehicle, which is '98 model year and above.  

The most significant and noticable exterior difference is the front-end treatment.  To my eyes, it looks like a job well done and properly cohesive.  The stock wheels have also been &quot;redesigned&quot; and just like the rest of the car, are quite classy, and not obnoxious in any way.  Also I am thankful the newest design has made the exterior quite nice to look at and attention-grabbing, at least compared to the previous design (way too bland, can we say &quot;VANILLA ONLY!&quot;???).

Inside, you will find the latest general interior treatment to all Lexus products.  For example the center console:  How the outside wood trim lines flow from the bottom up to your eyes is apparent in the ES300 and even the new GS series.  The luminescent dash guage light is no longer the strikingly attractive neon-red/orange dials on white-text/black-bg.  It is now a green hue, perhaps a better choice for many buyers, but not me.  Then again I also think it is a tragedy that the new Audi line has been rid of the everything-in-red lighting.

The exterior fit and finish is obviously world-class, and it better be for a Japanese car designed for the masses, yet going for $60k.  Nonetheless, a great job.  Interior f &amp; f is virtually flaswless too, as is the leather (although these days that really isn't saying much, as many cars for much less dough are receiving great quality control, even for hide selection).  The seats are of course non-sporty, i.e. with any aggressive lubmar support, yet are obviously designed for hours upon hours of state-to-state commuting.  Space is very generous, and well thought out.  The trunk capacity is very adequate as well, with easy access.  

One of the great features of the Lexus cars is the in-dash (or in glove box) multi-CD changers.  If they could figure out how to fit that sensibly, then why not?  Wouldn't you rather that than accessing it in your trunk?  Also less wiring (distance from the electronics) means less distortion possibility.  But I bet that has nothing to do with how fabulous the 290-W Nakamichi stereo system sounds.  Available in the GS-series as well, this system offers a level of fidelity that is beyond the offerings of close to all factory-offered systems in any car, regardless of price.  You will hear things in your most-listened music you have never thought existed.  Still though I think the 440W Harmon Kardon system (with a DSP!) in the 7-series BMWs is better overall (let's see, 14 speakers overall, 4 subwoofers, 440W...DSP...).  Also the proprietary Benz system offered in the previous gen. S-class (not offered in the USA, here it is solely Bose in the Merecedes, although I read once that they were offering a 20 (!!!) speaker system in the S-class).  Nonetheless it is worth writing a whole paragraph about the Nakamichi system.  Wow.

Now for the driving.  This car has been constantly heralded as the quietest car tested by many pro reviewers and their respective associations.  While it is like a TOMB in there, even up to 90mph, I never really felt a significant difference over the S-class or 7-series.  Also the Lexus LX470 is supposed to match the LS400's decible levels (how?  It has a much worse Cd).  In any case, you want luxury, you got it here, in DROVES, too.

The suspension is fantastic at doing it's thing:  Pampering.  However, unlike the German competition, Lexus (or any Jap maker for that matter) really hasn't figured out how to *really* integrate luxury with sportiness in their cars.  Going 120+mph in a straight line with obviously stability is one thing, but taking different kinds of TURNS at different speeds and driver inputs is what really constitutes handling.  Those Germans do some magic, causing their 4000+ lb machines to truly bely their heft in the turns.  Almost like a gorilla doing perfect ballet.  The LS400, especially in its latest design, really satisfies the handling composure of most, but it just doesn't even touch the German competition.  It has nothing to do with tire selection (an extremely important thing), it's just that as I have titled this review, the Japenese are very good at honing in on one thing and doing it well, such as A = Luxury or B = Sportiness.  A + B work is the art of german engineers.  They really have had the experience in this, and also you have to remember how they treat their model lifecycles.  The Japanese RADICALLY change their models every few years, while the Germans keep the same basic design for everything in the car the same for decades (usually).  That accounts to something, and that in my opinion is at least allowing a platform to figure out how to come up with this magic, even if you have to pay a premium for it.

As of '98, the 4.0L V8 got massaged to output 290HP and 300 lb-ft (peak).  This is up from 260 horses in the previous years.  And the improvements are VERY obvious.  This is not because of an additional 30HP.  It's because of Toyota's VVT-i engine management system.  Fabulous.  Torque all across the rev range.  If I remember correctly, Toyota/Lexus applies this system only on the exhaust cams, unlike many competitors who only intake (VTEC for Honda) or both (BMW's new double-VANOS system).  I might be wrong about the VTEC, but let's get back to the LS400.  You can get to triple digits speed in a big hurry.  Very nice.  And very quiet too.  The 5-spd auto tranny is also new in '98, and best the previous 4-spd in every way.  I especially like the smoothness of upshifts.  Wow.  Lexus really figured that one out (also evident on the ES300 and I guess all their models).

The steering is confidence-inspiring, not too light, thankfully, but no where near as pleasurable and accurate to use as in most German luxury cars.

Lastly, the VSC system on the Lexus, is certainly a good thing to have.  It offers the usual traction control over the driven rear wheels as well as spin control (stops over/understeer).  However, this system is *WAY* too uhm, how should we say, in-your-face?  I mean, if you do almost ANYTHING that comes close to threatening the balance of the car, even if you know what you're doing, it intervenes 100%!  This is why I favor BMW's DSC system over any other system, it keeps thing in check, but lets you play around.  :)  To its own merit, Mercedes's own ESP system, first on the market, and an award-winner for innovation, safety, and all that stuff, is almost as intrusive.  Again, this should be of no surprise to you.  The LS400 is a luxury car, period.  The engineers didn't want (or didn't know how) to offer anything less to you than complete &quot;idiot!  You're not supposed to do that!&quot;-immunity.  And well hey, I guess M-B wants to cater to most of its' 55+ year-old male customers.  Gee, am I BMW-biased?  :)


However, the brakes on the Lexus are excellent.  Very short stopping distances, even outside its class (like sports cars realm even).  Very linear in feel too.  They always feel ready.  

Of course, it offers Xenon lights.  Awesome, get this feature in any car you buy that offers them.  

So overall, the LS400 is awesome at one thing:  Luxury.  But it certaily doesn't offer the magical cohesiveness of sportiness with luxury ala the German alternatives.  Mercedes and BMW command a hefty premium over the Japanese luxury cars, but from my point of view, money well spent.  Sure that may not be the p.o.v. of many Luxury car buyers, but it would certainly be for me.<br><br>
