            I suspect this camera might be made by Kyocera / Yashica. You'll find the exact same camera with their name on it in places such as Ebay. Who knows?

You can find this camera at Circuit City, Walmart, Ebay and Fred Meyers if you live in the northwest.

You get two levels of quality, and three compression levels within each set. Wow.

I was astounded at the full feature set of this camera. MUCH more than I expected for under $200. Beyond Point-and-Shoot, you can manually adjust the white balance - there's even manual exposure compensation (all the way from minus 2 to plus 2, in half steps)!!!

The close-up / macro capabilities of the Digimax are great! I spent half a day taking photographs of flowers, bugs-on-flowers, coins and other tiny things - and was blown away by the quality and results.

As with all point-and-shoot cameras, there are flash limitations. This is even more so for digital cameras. The Digimax was about equal to most point-and-shoot cameras in this category. As with all digital cameras, I'd recommend having your indoor shots well-lit. 

I was able to get great portraits of friends indoors and out - and I've been printing up photos that actually LOOK like photos! 

This camera uses two batteries, where many digital cameras use four. Insofar as battery drain is a hard fact of life in the digital domain, consider this a plus.

Using the highest possible quality with the least compression, I've printed up 5x7 photos that are beautiful enough to send me out looking for some nice frames. At the lowest possible quality, I'm getting photos that are perfect for emailing and for some web pages.

You can make little digital movies on this, AVI files as well. Another surprise to me, in a sub-$200 camera. 

Having a party and want to share your photographs right away? Plug this into the TV or VCR and put on a slide show! It even lets you change between NTSC and PAL formats.

Want to send photographs to Grandma, who doesn't have and refuses to consider a computer? Plug this into your VCR, record the photos on the tape - even add narration, and send it to her!

If all this isn't enough, I'll even admit to loving it's looks; brushed silver & cool metallic blue finish, in a compact, retro body. Beautiful.

I originally bought this "cheap" camera as a means of taking quick, easy photos to email for friends & family, and to hoist simple low-to-medium quality photos quickly to web pages. I had no idea how much more I was getting, when I plunked my money down on the counter at point of purchase!
