            The Toyota Tacoma basic truck is a solid performer for the home or small business owner.   This is a surprisingly peppy and responsive truck.   Even with a full load in the bed (and a bit more lashed on too,) this little truck that can gets up and goes.

Keeping in mind that this is a pick up, the Tacoma handle the curves and hills of New England well.   The suspension is solid and meant to carry a load, but it is not the tail bone buster of years ago.

The engine is stingy, a trait that is dear to any New Englander's heart.   30 miles to the gallon on the highway is a consistent average.   This is also a dependable power plant.   It starts and goes the first twist of the key every time.

The cab can be a bit cramped for folks with long legs if you have the bench seat.   I'm short and if my 6' tall buddy rides with me at the wheel, it looks like he is trying to get the wax out of his ears with his knees.   Get the bucket seats.

The basic am/fm radio that came with the truck has excellent reception and very good sound.   I wish I had a tape player put in though.

The opening rear window is a real plus add on that I would highly recommend on any pick up, not just this one.   It improves ventilation and can be left open on a rainy day.   When used alone the opening rear window allows fresh air to enter the cab, without blast of air that you get from the side windows.   It also tends to be quieter too.

This is a high value truck.   It is dependable and economical.   A good return for your Buck!<br><br>
