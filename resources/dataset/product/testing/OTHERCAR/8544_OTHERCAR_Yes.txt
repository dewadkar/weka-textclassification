            Recently my car was totaled in an accident. I contacted my insurance company to see about a rental and was provided with this beautiful Jeep Cherokee for a week. 

My Jeep handled like a car! The power steering was responsive and made it a joy to drive. Being an automatic I was worried about whether it would have enough pick up but I was pleasantly surprised. You can easily merge into traffic and get down the road without causing other cars to slow down while you slowly pick up speed. This was a nice change from my Geo:)

With its 4.0 liter 190 horse power V6 engine this SUV was impressive to say the least. I truly enjoyed the power it provided. Even with the V6 it got good gas mileage averaging about 22 miles per gallon. This is a definite plus considering that gas prices are so high!

The interior was very comfortable even for long drives. I also was able to test out its performance in the rain with slippery roads and it performed wonderfully. The tires gripped the road well and I had no problem getting to my destination.

My only complaint about the design is that there is not a lot of leg room for taller individuals in either the front or back seats. The back seats have what I will estimate at only 12-14 inches between the edge of the seat and the back of the front seat. Also, because the rear end is so light weight it can fishtail easily if you are forced to apply the brake a bit faster or harder than usual.

I think this would make a good family car if you are in the market for a practical SUV for daily use. I felt very safe because of the anti-lock brakes and dual airbags standard and that is always a plus when considering your family.

Being only a 2WD, I would not suggest this vehicle for those who want to do off roading activities but it is great for around town or long trips.<br><br>
