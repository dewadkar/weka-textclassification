            I graduated from a full size station wagon to a minivan five years ago.  When I began shopping around, everyone said that once I drove a minivan I 
would love it.  I had my doubts, but after my first road trip, I loved the driving experience and have continued to love it ever since.
The best thing I can say about driving my van is that its great sitting high up.  Maybe its because I'm kind of short, and rarely have the occasion to look down on anyone older than 12 years.  Sitting up high gives me excellent visibility and command of the road.  Its a real &quot;downer&quot; when I have to drive my husband's sedan for the day.  In fact, my van is actually more maneuverable than most cars I've driven. 
My minivan is fully equipped with electric everything, but the one gismo I like the best is its automatic door locks.  As soon as my speed increases to 20 MPH the doors lock automatically, which I consider an excellent safety feature.  I also find the dashboard control panels user friendly and reliable - nothing has malfunctioned.                  Another wonderful feature of my van is its captain's seats in the front and middle rows.  The eight way power seats on front driver and passenger sides make everyone comfortable.  My girls, aged 14 years and 17 years, need their own space in the middle row.  Invariably, when one wants to lean back, the other must sit up, and vice versa.  Now they have one less thing to fight about!  I do, however, find the tilting seat in the middle row hard to manage, and only the right seat tilts, allowing ease of entry to the &quot;backy back&quot; from only the passenger side.  A driver side sliding door is also a great amenity, especially for my carpool lane that has kids entering and exiting from the driver's side.
The only drawback of this van is gas mileage - even though it uses regular gasoline, it only gets approximately 18 MPG with combined city and highway driving.
My husband doesn't appreciate the minivan as much as I do, and these types of cars seem to appeal to women more than men.  Maybe this is because they function so well for carpools, a rare experience from many men.  Or, it could be that the body style of the Town and Country, as with most other minivans, is sleek and certainly not rugged looking.  Or, it may be that the light iris color is not one of his favorites.  It may not be macho looking, but my minivan does the job well, and it does it in style.
