            I bought the Cougar for my wife who fell in love with how it looked. We did not physically look at other cars on the market because the Cougar, we thought, was the best looking car we could buy within our budget.  All new cars on the market now are reasonably well made, so I was not at all concerned about buying it blindfolded although I read just about all articles published on Cougar by the time we walked into the showroom.  

Performance was not as important, so a 4-cylinder Cougar would have satisfied her.  However, an I-4 has no automatic transmission option and likewise, we had to go with a V-6 and truthfully we were glad to be �forced� into this decision.

After putting some miles, I must say it is an excellent value.  However, it is not a car that is easy to drive, at least not until you get used to it.  First, the car feels very heavy...steering feels heavy, brake pedal feels heavy, and accelerator pedal feels heavy... All these contribute to the �solid� and �safe� feeling if look at it positively.  The Cougar turns corners with minimal roll, and stable at all speed.  I prefer driving it on highways where its aerodynamic body cuts through the air so efficiently.  Most noise is coming from its wide tires, so the condition of pavement plays an important factor in how noisy it gets�not too bad on most highways although it could've been made better.  The  owner�s manual explains the car will �learn� how it is being driven during the first few hundred miles to determine ideal shifting points.  Ours is still learning and it�s somewhat �slow� at start despite having a 6 cylinder engine. 

Sitting in the driver�s seat makes me feel like looking out of a tank due to Cougar�s limited visibility all around.  My wife thinks this is a cozy feeling... so, I guess it�s all relative how you look at it.  Seriously, the rearview mirror is placed about 5 inches from the top of windshield and it blocks most of the other half of the front view.  This makes me duck down my head to see what�s on my right side when making a right turn.  Compounding this problem is that both left and right sides windshield where they curve in have slight distortion that gives me headache if looking through this area more than a second or two. This is another reason I prefer highway driving when I don�t have to look around too much. The steep angle of windshield also reflect dash board (black) directly to driver's eyes when the sun is at certain position.  This may not bother some people, but it bothers me.  One way of dealing it is to wear a pair of polarized sunglasses, but I feel the dash board should have been designed with less reflective material.  Finally, the trunk line of a Cougar is very high.  Ours came with a spoiler (one of those �mandatory options� when getting a leather package), and this worsens the problem of seeing what�s directly behind.  Especially at nights, it�s difficult to see the headlights of a tailgating car as the lights don�t shine above the trunk line. Backing in this car to a parking lot needs a lot of practice and guess work.

Mercury had to cut cost somewhere to build this �value� car, and it shows through some of tacky plastic pieces in the dash.  The fit and finish of interior parts are not as good as exterior as there are large gaps here and there.  Otherwise, its interior looks fine to us.  I especially like the aircraft style vents, and the heat ducts for rear passengers.  My 10-year old son likes the comfort back �real bucket� seats, but he won�t be able to lie down in this �funny� shaped rear seats on long trips (perhaps this is a good thing).  He has already stated that he prefers my other car for long trips.  I cannot keep my heads straight in the backseat without touching the ceiling despite my small 5� 8� body, but this is expected.  Front seats are tad soft and comfortable for about 3-4 hours.  Its trunk space is very large even without folding in rear seat backs.

If I must pick one thing that I truly don�t like about this car, it would be the climate control.  It has no re-circulation button. And the windshield defroster automatically turns on the air conditioner which I wish I had the full control of.  But, again, if you like how it drives and how it looks, then you just learn to live with the rest.  With the Cougar, this seems to be the case. 

I stay neutral recommending this car to anyone. My wife likes it and I am happy when she is happy� I love to look at it, but I just prefer a lighter and more responsive car.  My 10-year old son prefers a bench rear seat versus Cougar�s rear bucket seats.  But again, he likes the look of this Cougar, and prefers to be seen in this car!
