            WE BOUGHT A USED 1998 WITH ~ 48K MILES, WORKED WELL FOR ABOUT 3MONTHS, COMPLETE NEW BRAKE JOB.  NOV 2001 - NOW SEVERE ENGINE PROBLEMS, TIMING BELT AND TENSIONER BROKE  AND REPLACED W/NEW ENGINE.  DURING THIS TIME, WE WERE TOLD BY CADILLAC THEY HAD 4 OTHER CATERA'S IN THE GARAGE W/EXACT SAME PROBLEM!  NOW ONLY 610 MILES LATER SAME EXACT PROBLEM! NOW BOTH GM AND CADILLAC ARE ADMITTING LIABILITY AND REFUSING TO PAY FOR ANY DAMAGES.  ALSO, ACCIDENTLY MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT ROLL OVERS WITH THIS VEHICLE.  ANY ONE WITH SAME PROBLEM?  THIS MAKES THE 3RD ENGINE FOR THIS CAR, THAT WE KNOW OF!

WE ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A CLASS ACTION CONTACT US IF INTERESTED IN JOINING!
