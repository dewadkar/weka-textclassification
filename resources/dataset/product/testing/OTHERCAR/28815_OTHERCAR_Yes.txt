            I've had this camera for approximately 2 years now.  For some reason, it has decided to stop functioning properly; it seems the auto-focus has gone haywire on me.  However, with that aside, I will discuss the 2 years of good use I put this camera towards.

First of all, I bought this camera online for approximately $400 and I also bought an additional 32MB card, and a Compact Flash reader, plus a camera case, which probably all in all cost me upwards of $600.  I was pretty pleased when I first got my hands on the item, and the pictures came out looking superb.  However, as time wore on, I noticed the technology of digital cameras exponentially increasing and by this same time last year, I was already wanting to trade it in for a better one.  I stuck with it though, due to money issues.

Anyway, I noticed a few things in using this camera that are worth mentioning.  The battery life with the LCD motion display (so you don't have to use the manual viewfinder, but rather look at the nice 2 inch LCD screen to take pics) ate up battery life like it was going out of style.  Also, after taking a picture, it takes about 5+ seconds to save the picture.  This is nice in someway, so that you can review it quickly, but in most ways it is not, if you are trying to take more than one photo of a "Kodak moment".  Anyway, also, when loading pictures, it will do a quickload, and to clear up the picture takes an additional 3 or 4 seconds, which is quite hindersome when you are trying to review your pictures quickly.  I also have had some problems with the battery cover coming off and my batteries spilling out.  No lens cover on this camera makes it less viable for risky situations where the lens can become scratched.  The camera is also on the bulkier side for portability ease.

Since my camera has malfunctioned on me, I'm not particularly sure what I am going to do just yet.  This only happened about a week ago, so I am going to try and contact Kodak shortly and see what they would recommend.  Althought there are quite a few cons I have with this camera (making me wish I had just went with a higher grade model like the Nikon Coolpix900) I still got plenty of use out of this camera (approximately 1500 pictures).  In any case, these cameras are going for less than $200 nowadays, so I don't really see anything too expensive about that.  I would recommend it to a beginner, just looking to take some quality digital pictures with affordability.
