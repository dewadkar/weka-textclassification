            As a previous Subaru owner I thought I'd love this wagon, but for the price I paid it's been nothing but trouble.  I've had repeated trips in for service, poor treatment by the service department and mistake after mistake in fixing this car. At one point I picked it up after three days of service to fix brakes that seemingly refuse to work, only to have it NOT start on the parking lot at the dealer! If you want this wagon, beware of WHICH dealer you buy it from!  Normally I think Subaru makes a good product but this has been a nightmare buyer's experience for me!  So far I've been charged three different times for service that was not performed and had to return to the dealer to get the work completed.  The brakes still sound like they are grinding coffee beans and it pulls hard to the left and has since the day I drove it off the lot.  My next trip in means I can invoke the Lemon Law.  Thank Goodness!<br><br>
