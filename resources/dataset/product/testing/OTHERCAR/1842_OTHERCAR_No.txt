             When my husband and I were looking for cars we wanted something that was sporty looking yet practical. We absolutely fell in love with the sleek looks of the Grand Am GT,then as soon as we test drove it we fell in love. The look was appealing the options were awesome and the price was very affordable. It also drove like a dream very smooth riding and great goa mileage.

Sound like a great car? well we thought so until we soon experienced the downfall of our sporty GT. Within the first year the heater core went bad,the headgasket was blown and the cd player had to be replaced twice! When we finally decided to trade it off we were even more shocked on how much our car had dropped in value. We paid 16,000 and 2 yrs later it was worth 6,000 what a drop!

So I would hesitate to recommend this car to anyone,even though it looked good,it wasn't worth the headaches for us.<br><br>
