            Buick Rendezvous CLX, 2003

For a Secluded Rendezvous.

The 2003 Buick Rendezvous is part minivan, part sport utility with a touch of sedan, mix it all together and you have the newest Buick on the road.

One word can summarized it, and versatility is that word.  

The Rendezvous can either be a seven-seater minivan, or a five-seater SUV or a two-seater truck and it drives as smooth as a fine sedan.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Buick Rendezvous is offered to consumers in two different trims. The base model is the CX, which you can choose from front wheel drive or all wheel drive as an option. The more luxurious trim is the CLX, which is available only as an all wheel drive vehicle.

Regardless which way you want your Rendezvous, it will be powered by 3.4 liter, V-6 engine.

The curb weight of the Rendezvous is 4024 pounds and has a wheelbase of 112.2 inches. The Rendezvous measures 186.5 inches in length, 73.6 inches in width and 68.9 inches in height. 

It has a front track of 6.7 inches, the rear track is 63.8 inches, and it also has a ground clearance of 7 inches.

The object of this review is CLX trim so the remainder will concentrate mostly on that model.

The CLX does come equipped with a very good list of standard features and also a good selection of safety features.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:  

As I approached the Rendezvous I was to drive out, its exterior body styling and the color combination on it impressed me.

Before going out after talking with the General Manager of the dealership, he handed a brochure of the Rendezvous. The one thing that interested me most in the Brochure, was the possible combination of seat arrangement.  So I proceeded in opening all the doors and witness all the possible seating combinations. I was very impressed by the versatility of this vehicle.  

I finally took place behind the steering wheel, as much I was impressed with the seating possibilities as much I was disappointed with the plastic used on the instrument panel. Nevertheless the rest of the inside is still very nicely done.

From the driver&#146s seat you will have an excellent front and side view and as far as it goes for a vehicle this type, the driver will still have an excellent view of the traffic coming from the rear. Also the view and access to all control buttons are within easy reach of the driver.

The Rendezvous CLX I drove was equipped with a very good list of Standard and luxury features: air conditioning, dual automatic climate control, odor and pollen filter, factory installed anti-theft system, ultrasonic rear parking assist, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather-heated seats, AM/FM radio cassette, CD player, rear window defroster, luggage rack and alloy wheels. 

The Rendezvous I drove also had the following optional features: OnStar system and head up driving display.

Front and rear legroom and headroom in the Rendezvous is quite acceptable.

The exterior:

As I mentioned above, the first thing that impressed me about the Rendezvous, was exterior appearance, especially the color combination and the fantastic quality of the paint job.  The exterior color was two tone, the top portion was a metallic beige and the bottom was reddish brown, it really made for a beautiful arrangement.  
 
Also the styling of the exterior is quite nice, it good to see that an American auto manufacturer still can be innovative. I predict that we will see more of this type of versatile vehicles on the road as soon as competitors catch on.

Another thing I like about this all-purpose vehicle is the rear door, the back is lower to allow for easier loading and the tailgate is wide enough to be able to slide in a sheet of plywood.

The standard cargo volume is 54.5 cubic feet of volume but this can change according to the possible seating combinations.

The standard towing capacity is 3500 pounds.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

It is hard to find something not to like about the Buick Rendezvous, aside from the plastic instrument panel I liked everything else about it.
