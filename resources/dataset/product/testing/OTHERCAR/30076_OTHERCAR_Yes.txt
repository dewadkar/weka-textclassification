            I bought this particular camera because it fit four requirements I was especially looking for. 1: outstanding 35mm quality photos 2: A reasonable price(now around $500 online). 3: Features usb downloading. And 4: Has a zoom lens. When it comes to stills, this camera blows away cameras 2 to 3 times its price with stunning crystal clear results.

 Action shot buffs should look elsewhere. Shutter speed is rather slow and action shots can come out blurry.

Sure, like many digital cameras the DC280 eats batteries quickly, but I have found buying an extra set of rechargeables will eliminate this problem.

I have seen complaints of poor close-up picture quality. However, Kodak makes a lens kit which includes 2 close-up lenses, a telephoto lens and a wide angle one all usable by the 280. For sale at the Kodak site, but cheaper elsewhere on the net. I have seen the results of the close-up lenses(very nice), and have used the telephoto lens myself(wonderful). <br><br>
