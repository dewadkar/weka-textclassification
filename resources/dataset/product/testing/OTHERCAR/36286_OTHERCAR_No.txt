            My husband and I bought this car in the spare of the moment...Our two cars had broken down and we needed something cheap and reliable. Since we purchased the car in April 98, we have had to take the car to the dealer for repairs more than 8 times, from a defective stereo, to the seatbelts not working properly to the c v joints( this after only 1 year and 13,000 miles) If you want to try your luck and see if it is better than mine, go ahead, I will not recommend this car to any of my friends. Besides, every time we had to take the car to the dealer for repairs, they were rude, and most of the time did nothing to it, so I had to take it back. Please check other cars before deciding on this car<br><br>
