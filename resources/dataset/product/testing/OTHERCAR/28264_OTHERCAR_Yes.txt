            The family minivan had 110,000 miles, the middle daughter had a horse, and I had 4WD lust. So we did the right thing and looked at the Suburban and then the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Suburban was too big, and the seats would be VERY uncomfortable on a long ride. The Jeep couldn't pull a big horse trailer, and did not have a frame with which to counteract the forces of towing. As an afterthought, we looked at the Durango. I hadn't liked the styling (Looked too much like a NASCAR-crowd thing). But the combination of size (Not too big, bot too small -- JUST RIGHT!), seating capacity (theoretically 8 compared to Jeep 5), towing might (up to 10,000lbs), and 4 wheel drive coolness sold it.

We opted for a bright red one when the maroon one had a transmission problem on pick-up day. This vehicle has been wonderful, with the following problems: an AWFULLY weak AC system and a gasoline thirst that makes standing at a pump a regular chore.

I have since taken it four-wheeling, and it is VERY capable in this department (and I am comparing it to an ARMY HMVWW). As long as I wash it before handing the keys back to Mom.
