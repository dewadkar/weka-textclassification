            THE GOOD: 
The camera is so easy to use you will master it in 20 minutes without the instruction manual. This is definitely a bonus when handing it to a friend for a quick snapshot. 

It is light weight, compact and looks stylish. It has both an LCD screen and an optical viewfinder. This means you can preview a pending picture and view pictures you've already taken on a small screen on the camera's body AND through the eye piece. 

The camera has all of the features you would want from a point-and-shoot: automatic flash, red eye reduction, self timer, extensive zoom - everything. 


THE BAD: 
Like all digital cameras, it sucks the life out of batteries. But there are three unique flaws you should be aware of. 

1. There is a lapse in time between the moment you take a picture and the moment the camera records the picture. It is under a second, but it is enough to mess up an action shot and to miss capturing the perfect facial expression. 

2. The LCD and optical viewfinder do not work well in low light situations. The picture will still take, you just won't be able to see what you're doing on the screen. 

3. The on/off button is an inch from the picture taking button. It is easy to mistakenly turn the camera off when trying to take a photo. 


IN CLOSING: 
I like the camera. I knew its flaws before I purchased and still bought it anyway. The perfect digital camera isn't out there yet, so this will do for now. 

(For those unfamiliar with pixels and photo quality, pixels are tiny little dots that make up a photo. The more pixels, the better the quality. A regular SLR camera creates pictures with 7-8 million pixels. The best digital camera can only create a photograph with 5-6 mil pixels. They are very expensive at the moment - thousands of dollars. This camera has 3 mil pixels, which is good. If you print out the photographs, they will look just fine. You just won't be able to enlarge them too much or else you'll notice the small pixelation. If you are using your digital camera for the web, you only need 1-2 mil pixels. Higher pixelation will slow the upload time of the page with unnoticeable results. So as far as pixel count, this camera is near the top of the market right now.)
