            Now that you want a Pilot (see the other excellent reviews in this section), I&#146ll try to give you a rationalization for buying one instead of the minivan you actually need. 

This review may be useful to you if you&#146re doing the Pilot-versus-minivan dance and need some reasons to make sure you buy the Pilot, which is what you really want. It doesn&#146t contain feature descriptions and comparisons with other SUVs. I&#146m offering it because I found the other reviews helpful; I hope a few people might find this helpful. In other words: this is what worked for me; your mileage may vary.

With the Pilot, Honda was aiming squarely at me: age 40s; a third (and final!) child on the way; can afford some choice in vehicles; and most importantly: I just couldn't pull the trigger on a minivan. That's my problem, but apparently a few others share it. 

I really didn&#146t want a minivan. When I got married, this was one of the private marriage vows that my beloved and I shared, knowing that we intended to have children: no minivans. Something about keeping the whole spirit of our wild, madcap singlehood and courtship alive&#151I forget the specifics, but there was definitely a part about no minivans. 

I also didn&#146t want an SUV&#151feeling that, for most people, they&#146re overkill, plus unsafe, poor mileage. I figured: Subaru Outback, that&#146s for me&#151the unofficial Car of Seattle, where I live. My parents, in-laws, and brother all have them, and they really are nice cars. But suddenly, somehow, I have a third kid on the way. And the Subaru won&#146t fit three car seats. And even if it did, you&#146d never have room for an additional kid passenger, let alone an adult. 

So, reluctantly, I began to feel I would have to swallow my pride because, really, what non-SUV was big enough to carry three car seats and provide an extra kid seat or two? Despite our vows, we actually almost bought one&#151a used Odyssey&#151and were saved only by the lousy trade-in the dealer offered on our 1998 New Beetle (yes, we&#146ve used the Beetle as primary transport for our two kids). So instead of signing, we walked. Meanwhile, my brother (no minivan lover, he) said: check out a Pilot. A what, I said.

So to make a long story short, here are the critical reasons in rough order of importance that resulted in me (well, my wife) driving home a Pilot:

1.	It&#146s not a minivan. And we must <b>try</b> to be true to our marriage vows, right?

2.	It&#146s not a minivan, and so therefore I wouldn&#146t wake up every day hating the thing on which I&#146d just spent $25K. That would make me grumpy for a few years. 

3.	Headroom: I&#146m 6'2" and kind of longish on top (built like a 6'6" guy but with shorter legs), and there are lots of cars I just can&#146t fit in&#151any Acura, for instance, and most importantly <b>the Dodge Caravan</b>. This eliminates a whole line of minivans, and that&#146s great. (&#147Gee, I&#146d like to buy a used Caravan for $15K instead of twice that much for a new Pilot, but I just don&#146t fit in the Caravan. Law of physics, and all. Sorry.&#148) (The New Beetle, by the way, has GREAT headroom and is a gas to drive, especially now that the child seats are out and it&#146s become &#147my&#148 work car.) Anyway, the Pilot has almost 42&#148 of headroom up front&#151more than most any minivan&#151or a lot of SUVs, like the Toyotas. I need over 40&#148, and so in the Caravan I basically formed an additional roof pillar, which wasn&#146t comfortable, especially driving over speedbumps and potholes. 

4.	Seating arrangement: By the time we were as close as we&#146d get to buying a minivan (which was shockingly close), we&#146d decided on the Odyssey. But then I realized that with three kids <b>we would always have the third row seats open</b>. Why is this important? Because one of the selling points on minivans in general and the Odyssey in particular is the disappearing (or removable) third row of seats&#151great for trips. But the second row on the Odyssey and most others only fits <b>two</b> car seats, which means that the third row must always be open. And that negates the whole cargo advantage. You&#146d actually have to put all the kids way back in the third row and then remove the second row seats and leave them at home to get maximum cargo space, and that&#146s dumb. 

The Pilot beats this in two ways&#151first, the second row can accommodate <b>three</b> child seats, because the Pilot is w-i-d-e. So with three small kids, the third row can be folded flat for cargo storage. Second, both the second and third rows split 60/40&#151which means that, even if you do need to put a passenger (a friend in child seat; or one of your child seats when you want to haul a grandparent or two) in the third row, you still get 2/3 of the storage benefit. (Important note: The new 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan has a disappearing third row that splits 60/40. <b>Do not tell your co-decision-maker about the new Toyota Sienna!</b>) 

I can&#146t overstate how important the seating issue is for winning the Pilot&#151I pulled my child seats out of the Beetle and put them into the Pilot (full of the muck and crumbs and who-knows-what embedded in them by my kids) to verify how this would work, and then pointed to the Odyssey and said &#147You can&#146t do this in that.&#148 My advice: if you have three kids, grab this point and hold onto it for dear life. 

5.	The Pilot really <b>is</b> a minivan, but better. I mean, it&#146s got the same engine and chassis and almost the same mileage as the Odyssey, but you get 4-wheel drive and a better seating configuration, it&#146s not tarted up like some of the he-man SUVs (e.g., Exterra), <b>plus</b> you don&#146t wake up hating it every day (see #2 above). In fact, you might like it. A lot. And life is short. Too short for minivans. 

6.	Skip the leather. See, you can rationalize everything compared to the minivan on practical grounds&#151just want the best value, dear&#151but the leather option is pure luxury. So to avoid cognitive dissonance, I got the cloth seats, which I like just fine but I realize it&#146s a personal choice. I&#146m just saying. 

7.	Skip the video DVD. See above point. Plus you can add one in the aftermarket for less than the $1500 Honda wants. Also, if you need the optional backup camera that&#146s available with the video system, maybe you might consider another (smaller) vehicle altogether. I know I&#146d feel safer if you would. 

8.	Cost: OK, this is a tricky one. The dealers are trying to give you the shaft by marking up $2500 over MSRP. I don&#146t know how much this helped me, but I waved cash&#151I told the dealer I&#146d give them $14K in cash today if I liked the deal, and was pre-approved for the rest (which allowed me to negotiate a better interest rate with them&#151better than my pre-approval rate). I ended up paying &#147just&#148 $500 over MSRP. They&#146d asked $2,500 over sticker; I&#146d offered sticker, and $500 is what they picked my pocket for. In Honda land, that&#146s the small &#147victory&#148 they might let you walk away with, and I don&#146t know if the cash helped, but I don&#146t suppose it hurt. Fine, I&#146m a sucker. So what? I got my Pilot. 

9.	I didn&#146t get the LX, which is the stripped model, because I don&#146t think any actually exist. Either do the dealers&#151nobody&#146s ever actually seen one, it seems&#151about as rare as Bigfoot. They&#146re a myth created for the sole purpose of making you buy the next better thing, which is the EX. But really, the stuff you get for the EX price bump includes some stuff that you probably want anyway&#151the roof rails, the keyless entry, security system. Plus stuff that&#146s OK if Honda insists that you take it, like a better stereo and extra pockets and cupholders. Plus stuff that&#146s purely esthetic, like the wheels, trim, etc. And if you want leather or the DVD (which I didn&#146t)&#151game over, you have to get the EX. And remember, the dealer will still stiff you with the surcharge for an LX, particularly if they have to order one&#151forget about negotiating. So the net difference in final cost might be pretty low or close to non-existent if you add back things that are standard on the EX like roof rails, etc. 

10.	Oh&#151we looked at some other non-minivan alternatives. In short: VW EuroVan&#151can&#146t place child seats in the rearward-facing seats of the MV model, which is what we liked&#151even the dealer didn&#146t know this&#151we found out from another owner who had to trade down to the GLS. Plus the headroom is bad for me, and the front wheel well protrudes into the driver&#146s left foot area&#151why doesn&#146t this bother anyone but me? Volvo V90&#151can&#146t seat small children in the third row. Plus cost and reliability are both bad. Any others? Not that I know about.


So there you go. One final word: with the Pilot, even though you may have paid a lot more than you set out to pay when you thought you had to have a minivan, you won&#146t have buyer&#146s remorse. With a minivan&#151shudder&#151about the best I could think of saying was: well, it&#146s cheap. Which the good ones aren&#146t and the cheap ones&#151well, I don&#146t fit in a Caravan. With the Pilot, no remorse. Guilt, maybe, for giving in to your desires. But you can live with that.
