            For a city dweller I found the compactness of the Passat made it easy to park in any space. I especially gravitated to the look, with the lower aero dynamic front end. And a side view of the car reveals a sporty order. 

The Passat has a listed ground clearance of about 4.5&#148. However, it looked higher to me so I measured. From the ground to the bottom of the rear bumper was 13", from the ground to the bottom of the side board and the first obstruction on the under belly was 8", and from the ground to the bottom of the front bumper was 9" which allows grill clearance on high curbs or parking blocks, no worries about scraping the door on the sidewalk either. Ground clearance was an important technical dimension for me because I have almost a mile of very uneven ground as my driveway. And I did not want to invest in a gas guzzling, smog emitting SUV. 

Surprisingly, the Passat has an amazing amount of trunk space. I have hauled as many as 5 bags of 2cubic feet planting mix along with groceries and a 50lb bag of kitty litter. The back seat folds forward to allow even more storage space for those awkward and odd shaped items. CD player, alloy wheels, sunroof and Triptronic shifting, all make up the package I happily opted for. 

The Triptronic shifting is probably the coolest part of the vehicle. I found being able to go from automatic transmission to standard, without a clutch, came in handy for lower gear usage on the steep hills of San Francisco. Note: There is no back slippage when the car is at a full stop on a steep hill in gear.

The biggest downside is functionality or lack there of on the front seats. There is no quick release to launch the front seats forward, and turning the knob to either adjust the seats forward or backward is time consuming. I'm not particularly fond of the manual seat adjustments for the driver or passenger seat comfort levels for height, leg room and backrest either. 

Lastly, the special key, a signature for VW, could be viewed as a design faux pas or the best thing since hide-a-key. I'm still getting used to opening and closing the key holder itself just to operate the vehicle.
