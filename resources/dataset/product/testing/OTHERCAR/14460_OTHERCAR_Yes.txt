            I currently own a 1996 Toyota Camry LE.  The only additional options I purchased were the mudguards and the premium stereo system.  I needed something reliable, quiet, and comfortable, and Consumer Reports recommended it.  Let me just say that I am very happy with my purchase.

I actually had a 1994 Toyota Camry first.  I firmly believe that all the safety features in my first Camry saved me from serious injury.  I was driving in bad weather and my car skidded off the road.  The airbag was ignited and I walked away from that crash almost without a scratch.  I will never take for granted what my car did for me that day.  Needless to say that the car was totaled and I purchased my new car in early 1996.

The standard features on the Camry are great.  I am so used to these features now that I can't name them off the top of my head.  You can always go to the literature for that.

Now for the attributes I do know about.  The driving is great.  I now have over 110,000 miles on the car and the only difference is that the engine is a little louder.  The manual is great, because it explains everything.  I am not mechanically inclined and when I had a flat tire, the manual took me through it step by step.  It was pretty easy.

The room in the front and back seat is very adequate and I have a bit more trunk space than most of the people I know.

I'm looking forward to driving this car for another 100,000 miles and then trading it in for my next Toyota...<br><br>
