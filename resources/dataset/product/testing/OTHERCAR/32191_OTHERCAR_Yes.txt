            I bought this car new it is a ls 4 door sedan it had a sticker price of $16,200 and it has just about every option possible except rear spoiler and alloys reason for this was that was the way i wanted it.

Now i have looked at the other writers and here is what i have found good and bad.Mine was bought new and now has 26,000 miles on it.First of all a lot have said it rides bad well i think it rides fairly good for a small car.If you want a really good ride you will have to spend $30,000 or more if you want a so so ride you might find it at $20,000 and then maybe.

As for room well again this is a small car with a small price tag if you want room you will spend a lot more.It has more room then the 94 and back model years for the cavalier and the seats are much better than back then.And has less wind noise and engine noise.

This model is a 4 speed automatic shifts very smooth and at highway speeds is a pleasure to drive compared to the older models with out the 4 speed transmission.It gets about 32 highway and 28 city as for pickup. Plenty of power however some of the other writers disagree.But if your like me and not on a race track. Going at the posted speed limits and Just want something with enough merging power that will get up and go then no problem. If your the many who pass me up like im standing still when im running 70 then again you will need to spend $20,000.You might be wondering why i compared the 99 to the models 94 and back well thats because i am a 3 time new cavalier owner the first being a 91 and then another in 94 and this one in 99 so yes i recomend cavalier.

 Now some of the bad things about this model.If it was not for the air bag this car could have more room the dash sticks out and that is because of the passenger side air bag.But they all have it now and we have to put up with that.Also in the winter the dash has some annoying radels from that dash on ruff roads and here in Illinois that is almost all roads.Running your defoster to put the heat thru that dash stops the radels it is that the plastic when it is cold shrinks slightly and causes the drive you nuts radels you will not here any if the temperture is above 32. I no sounds stupid but it is the way it is.The next bad thing is the way they built the trunk.And it is not just the cavalier model the hinge arms that are so big when you close the trunk you must keep things away from them or the trunk comes down and those stupid hinge arms hit and will not close this was not like that on the 94 model sedan but now it is on this model all i have to say to that is wake up GM!!!And those are the only things i do not like about the 99 there built and drive and ride and have more power than the older models and fit and finish is much better so if your looking for a low cost car worth the money i think this is as good as it gets. But if you want room and a really nice ride you will have to spend a lot more money that simple.
