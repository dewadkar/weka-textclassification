            In 1995 my ex-husband and I were out car shopping.  We bought a 1992 Nissan Sentra GXE.  I loved it when I first got in it and sat down.  It was loaded!!  My first new car.(New to me, It was only 3 years old.)  It had about 18000 miles on it (I think it has been a few years)  I think that it was about $8500.  It was used when we got it.

  This car was the color champagne on the outside, with tan interior.  It was a five speed, that was in between the seats.  There were 2 bucket seats and a bench backseat. It was a four door car.   It had automatic windows, automatic door locks, automatic seatbelts, air, tilt, cruise, moon roof, and a cd player. 

This was a great little car.  It got excellent gas mileage, you could fill up and drive for about 2 weeks on the same tank of gas.  It usually got about 275 to 300 miles to the tank.  This was a good first car for us.  The car payments were about $225 a month.  Insurance was not very high on it either.  It was just a small little car.  But I enjoyed it.

My ex-husband got into a wreck in this car.  Someone ran a red light and hit him.  He was spun around.  The car was beat up pretty bad,  but it was still running!  This car takes a licking and keeps on ticking!!  It was not driveable back to the house.  He had to call a tow truck.  But the little car would not give up, it was still running.

I think this car would be good for any teenager.  It is a safe car.  I wish that I had gotten this car when I first got my license.  I enjoyed it while we had it.  This was a cute little car.  

Thank you for reading! Have a good night!
