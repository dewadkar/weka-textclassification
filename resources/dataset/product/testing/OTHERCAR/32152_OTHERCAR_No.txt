            This vehicle, as my title suggests, is average. I bought due to Daewoo's brilliant, brilliant reputation. The cost of the car was another factor in the purchase of this car.
There wasn't really anything that stood out with this car. Something I did like though was it's safety. It has a good reputation in the Euro NCAP safety test (3/4 stars). It comes with driver and passenger airbags; ABS optional on my (past tense) vehicle.
There isn't anything that  is bad about this car, except for the fact that it is a Daewoo, who I have just found out are a load of rubbish.
Driving this vehicle isn't any thing special. It's perfectly adequate for the job of going to the supermarket, although it's overall ability does not match my latest car. (Which I have also written about if you can find it.) The driving position is OK I guess. 
People who should buy this car would be nice, normal, mass-murderers and queer people.
People who shouldn't buy this car would be normal straight people.    <br><br>
