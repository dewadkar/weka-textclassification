            America, welcome to the year 2000... or the year 1965?!  VW has outdone itself again with this adorable little car.  Modeled after the 1965 version of their &quot;punch buggy,&quot; the New Beetle has been twisted and refined into a more modern vehicle. 

Shaped like a jelly bean, this car glides smoothly and confidently over all roads, never failing to turn heads and evoke smiles of all who watch it.  The New Beetle has a distinct presence... it practically screams &quot;individuality,&quot; &quot;fun-ness&quot; and &quot;good humor.&quot;  Plus, this new auto is environmentally sound, has a fabulous sound stereo system and comes fully equipped with a built-in flower vase for those who want to re-live their memories of the 60's.  America, this car smiles at you. Buy it and love it! Peace. <br><br>
