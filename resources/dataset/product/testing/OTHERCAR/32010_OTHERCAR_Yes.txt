            1997 Lexus ES300.

The es300 is a mid-size, near luxury, 4 door car.  This review will have 5 parts:  Exterior, Interior, Performance, Reliability/Service, and Price.

Exterior

This is a beautiful car.  I still do a double take every time I see one, and I could just look in my garage at mine!  The lines of the car are smooth and refined.  I particulary like the headlights, I feel they give this family car a sporty look.

Interior

With almost all Lexus cars, leather interior is standard.  Mine is not an exception.  The leather seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.  It makes a drive through rush hour traffic much more bearable than before.  The ergonomics of the vehicle are outstanding.  The instrument panel is easy to read, the stereo controls are a short reach away.  The stereo itself is quite remarkable.  I have the 6 disc CD changer option in the glove compartment.  I would recommend this option if u are a music lover like myself.  The car has plenty of room in both the back and front.  3 passengers can fit comfortably in the rear.  As with all Lexus vehicles, the interior is dead quite, regardless of city driving, or cruising on the interstate. 

Performance

The es300 comes standard with a 3.0, 24 valve, V6 engine.  It provides smooth acceleration, while also providing good gas mileage.  I usually get an average of around 25 with a mix of city/highway driving.  The engine is so quite and smooth, that I sometimes have to look at the Tach. to make sure the engine is running!

Reliability/Service

Lexus and their parent company of Toyota have always been industry leaders in terms of reliability.  Many Lexus cars will run past 200k or even 300k in properly maintained.  The service of Lexus dealers in outstanding.  If you have to bring your car in for a repair or oil change, they will lend you and service car to use until the repairs are done.  This is unheard of with any other auto manufactures in the United States.  

Price

In 1997, I paid about 36k for my fully loaded Lexus.  I consider that a bargain when comparing the service and pleasure of driving this vehicle day in and day out.  Today my vehicle has 70k miles on it, and it blue books for $24,000.  That is a testament to the value of these cars.  Sure, you could spend a couple of thousand less for an American made car that is way behind in the quality of Lexus.  But I strongly believe in the statement:  "You get what you paid for".  Lexus is quality.
