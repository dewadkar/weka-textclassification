            I bought this camera summer 2001.  I took it along with me on a road trip to Yellowstone National Park.  On that trip I took about 300 pictures before the batteries (2-AA lithiums) ran out (buy at least a 64mb compactflash photo card for this number of pics).  There are only two settings for picture quality, good=900x1200, and best=1800x1200.  I used mostly good quality during my trip to save space.

You can easily hook the camera up to your newer TV or VCR to see your pictures.  Even at good quality my father was amazed at the quality of the greatly enlarged photos on the screen, which enticed him to get his own kodak digital camera.  The movies are quite funny looking and sounding though.  I believe the movies get 16 frames per second and on tv the movies are somewhat blurry. They sort of reminded me of old home videos...

You don't need to buy the one touch docking system...or whatever it is called.  It is basically a battery recharger and you just place your camera in there when you want to put your pictures on your computer.  The picture software automatically comes up when you hook your camera up to your computer via USB, and is really easy to use, so I do not see the need for the dock...especially when you could get a battery charger for $20 at walmart...

This camera is good for a beginning photographer such as my self...Serious photographers would probably be willing to spend more money on a camera that has more features...This would probably be a good gift for older teens, but children might have trouble using, though maybe nowadays kids know more about technology than the parents...so who knows!

The camera came with a USB cable, that seems to be specially made for the camera, as when I lost it my other USB's wouldn't fit into the small opening.  There is one of those cables that hooks up to your TV/VCR with the 3 yellow,white, red ends (don't know what this is called!). It comes with batteries which is nice,since they are the pretty expensive lithium kind. There is an attachment that makes your camera fit into the photo dock incase you purchase that.  It also comes with decent instructions and photo software.  The software isn't that impressive, and on my mother's older computer causes her computer to crash regularly.  It often freezes on my newer computer, so I just use the transfer software and use another program for playing around with the pictures.

I hope this was somewhat helpful, as this is my first review, and I don't really know the technical "computer words"...sorry!
