            Let Me Start off By Saying that I have owned 2 Previous Digital Cameras(Kodak DC-210 Plus and a Sony Mavica FD-90) So I do write this review with some expirence. Ok, I just got this camera at Best Buy for $999 on Sunday Oct. 27 2001. I was headed there to get a Replacment for my FD-90(Read My Review on this Camera) and originally intended to spend anywhere between $700-$800, and NOT Get a Sony(Read the FD-90 review and you Will Understand!!!). However that Marketing appeal of Sony Sucked me in, and only 2 minutes from the time I walked into Best Buy, I was walking out with a new Digital Cam. 


Why did I choose Sony after I vowed never to get a Sony again? Well for 2 simple reasons, the 5.24 MegaPixels, which is the most for a digital camera to date, and the Rechargable lIon Batteries. Having a recharageable battery is AWESOME for a Digital Camera, those AA batteries get expensive after awhile! I like the memory sick solid state storage format because they are tiny and can fit anywhere(Plus You Can Trick your Friends with it, and tell em its a stick of gum :-) hehe) They are small, and hold a ton of data(Amazing what the World has today!!). 

How Many Pics can a Memory Stick Hold? Well Im glad you Asked!! On the Highest Resoultion(5.24 MegaPixels) You can get about 8 Pics on a 16mb Memory Stick, Yup Thats right, each Image is 1.8mb in size, not for a Dial up user! 

I do Not Recommend this camera for a beginner camera simply because there are WAY too many features to use. Im still trying to figure out half of them!!. I like the Night Framing Feature. It uses the NightShot infa-red to let you frame your pics at night, and then turns off and uses the flash to illuminate the pic(That was the main problem I had with the FD-90, at night it was next to impossible to properly frame a photo at night, however it can easily be done with the F707). It also has a Night Shot mode, just like on the camcorders, you can take Green InfaRed shots in pitch black darkness.

The F707 has a Dual LCD Screen, and a LCD Color Viewfinder. This is really nice, because when your at a play or somewhere dark you really dont want a Bright LCD screen illuminating everyone around you, so you just turn the Screen off and Look into the viewfinder, its that simple!

That About Does It for My Review of the DSC-F707
