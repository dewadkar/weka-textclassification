            Want something with great gas mileage and sporty looks? This is the car!

I bought a 1995 Honda del sol for $10,900 with only 40k miles last year(1999) and have had it for a year with absolutely nothing messing up on it. That's the dependability of this Honda. It always starts with the first turn of the key.

This car has a very unique body style that will have you turning heads left and right with people trying to figure out exactly what it is.

Being that I have the Si model, it came with a manual 5-speed transmission, am/fm tape player(which has been replaced by a Sony cd player), power locks &amp; windows. An interesting part of this car is that the back window rolls down.

Also, the top comes off and has an easy storage rack in the trunk, with tons of trunk space left. The rack has a button where you can raise it to get to the storage area in the trunk.

There are two lockable storage compartments behind the seats.

For those of you who know what a Honda CRX is, this was the step up from that, although in Japan it was known as the CRX III.

This car is an amazing summer vehicle with all the dependability of a Honda.<br><br>
