            With less than 80,000 miles,we had to replace the alternator, transmission, front wheel bearings, and front brakes.  It has a &quot;shift flare&quot; which is not considered part of transmission and will require more expense.  The great gas mileage comes at the expense of being so aero-dynamic that it will not go through any snow depth.  It is only a highway and/or summer automobile.  It has a great stereo, the cup holder is conveniently located and the seats are relatively comfortable.  Unlike most vehicles of this size, a full grown adult can sit comfortably in the back seat.  There is plenty of trunk space.  It is difficult to speak with a live Hyundai representative unless you pay for the long distance telephone call.  Even then, they do not seem eager to hear your complaints.    <br><br>
