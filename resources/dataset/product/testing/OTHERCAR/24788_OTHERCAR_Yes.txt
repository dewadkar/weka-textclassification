            Do you hate going to the mechanic's shop?  Do you have kids, live in a big city on a budget?  Then you should purchase this diamond of a car!  I purchased a used one, 1991 LE, in 1995.  It had 70,000 hwy miles on it.  I bought it from the original owner who had added a whole bunch of features to it.  I now have 155,000 miles on it, and it runs and sounds great.  You know...those car engine and transmission sounds?  It still purrs and the shifting is not detectable.  AND I HAVE ONLY HAD TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH IT PERIOD.  One of them was my fault.

It has only stranded me when the battery died.  That was my fault.  It needed water.  I have only had two repairs on it..thermostat in 1996 and the exhaust manifold in 1997.  I think the exhaust manifold was my fault because I put in a gas additive and the higher octane...oops!  The manifold cracked, or rather split in two pieces.  

After those repairs, I haven't had anything since.  Most car thieves don't bother stealing the Toyotas because the doors are made differently and are extremely hard to jimmy.  The interior is the standard beautiful but durable material that Toyota uses in all of it's vehicles.  

I recommend this car to anyone on a budget, with kids, in college, first car, you name it.  It's the best reliable and NO MAINTENANCE car you will ever own.<br><br>
