            My 1999 Dodge Dakota Club Cab is everything a truck should be - powerful, roomy, and looks good.  This is my second Dakota purchase, which was made because of my positive experience with a 1990 Dakota Club Cab.  I still have the 1990 Dakota Club Cab, which still runs great (never had any mechanical problems) and has over 130,000 miles.  

This new truck was a special order from the factory because I wanted the 5-speed manual transmission in a 2-wheel drive, standard bed truck.  It has the Magnum V6 engine which is more powerful than the older truck's standard V6, which means gas mileage is a little less too.  But the new truck really needs the extra power because the curb weight is much heavier.  The interior is roomy, but seems a wee-bit smaller than my older Dodge.  This may be because the cab slopes inward slightly, giving a little more rounded appearance than the older, boxy look.  The headrests are part of the seat, which means there's no visual space to view out through the extended cab side windows.  The older Dodge has adjustable headrests, which allow me to look between the headrest and seat back when I need to look out the right side window.

The console and dash of the 1999 Dakota is very well laid out and comfortable to use.  I really like the power outlet, which allows me to charge up my cell phone or lets my son play his video game system even when the engine is turned off (like when you're pumping gas at the gas station).  Since my son rides with me a lot, it's also nice to be able to turn off the passenger side airbag.  

The one improvement Dodge needs to make is to the fan controls on the air/vent/heat system.  There is no separate control for recirculating air - it's a part of the air conditioning setting for some reason.  So, if it's the dead of winter and you have the heat blasting, but you pull up behind a big bus with noxious fumes coming out of its exhaust system right into your cab, you can't turn the recirculation on without having the air conditioning come on!!  Adding a separate pushbutton to turn recirculation on/off would go a long way in improving the ventilation system, in my opinion.
