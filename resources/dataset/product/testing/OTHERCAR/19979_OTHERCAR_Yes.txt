            I got my 94 Chevy Beretta base model three months before I got my license on my 17th birthday.  I wasn't real set on any particular car while shopping.  I looked at pretty much anything within my price range, and then I happened upon this gem at a dealer.  With 38,000 miles on the clock and only $7000, my mind was made after driving it.  

I have seen some Berettas before finding this one, and none of them caught my eye as much.  This one was black, with a blue/light blue stripe down each side.  It looked different from all the rest, but now I appreciate the sporty good looks of most Berettas I see.  

The gas mileage is great on the 4 cylinder models.  I deliver pizzas four, sometimes five days a week and even so I only have to fill the tank every two weeks or so.  I have never had to do any major repair/service work on this car.  Besides the A/C working on and off and a small alignment problem, I have been lucky to own such a reliable vehicle.  This combination of gas mileage and reliability is very good for poor college students such as myself.

Now, however, I want to fulfill my dream of having a Mustang, so I will be parting with my Beretta shortly.  I loved this car though, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a sporty looking car that can be quick when it needs to be, that is cheap to maintain and is all around very reliable.
