            Im very impressed with the way sony built the mavica. All the plastics seem upscale, there are no loose parts that move all around when you handle it, and all buttons as well as the battery door function very smoothly. The MVC-81 has all the main features such as adjustable intensity flash, 5 preset auto-exposure settings (such as portrait, background, sports etc.), and two settings to adjust image quality (both size and clarity). 

The battery life of the mavica with the stock setup is quite good. The manual states it can run about 90 minutes on a full charge, and actually I got a little over a 100. However, the battery does not live a very long life, and eventually the "estimated battery life indicator" becomes useless after about 100 charge/discharge cycles. My results led to about a one year total life span on the stock battery and I use the camera about 15-20 times a month. I then bought a more powerful longer life battery which last well over 170 minutes on a full charge and Ive had no problems with it yet. if you can fork out the extra dough, get the "NP-F550" battery. 

As far as picture clarity goes, the camera does a fairly good job. However, on the standard quality setting, the pictures do appear a bit grainy. The 3.5" floppy disk stores roughly 30-40 pictures on standard mode, and about 15-25 on fine mode. 

The mavica also has a camera function which will film a good 60 second movie at low quality, however, this does include sound as well. The mavica has a built in microphone to accomplish this.

The mavica is also very easy to use and the on-screen menus couldnt be easier to navigate. You simply use the rocker located at the bottom to scroll through and press down on it to select.

Overall, this camera is terrific if you are the beginner-intermediate type of photographer. The mavica is not a sophisticated machine, but rather a refined rudimentary digital camera to get you through those memorable times. It is very reliable and very forgiving and I urge you to get one if you are in the market.
