            XL-7 stands for either �Extra Long  7 seat Vitara�, or �Excellent 7 seater�, depending on your country of purchase. I bought my XL-7 down here in Australia 2 weeks ago, and even in that short a time I have grown to love its quality build and spacious interior.
Quality build? Lets just say that when you shut the doors they respond with a nice solid CLUNK, and the rest of the body seems just as solid. In fact after covering 200 kilometres (120 miles) over rugged, pot-holed roads I still haven�t detected one squeak or rattle. 
The engine is a sweet V6 which has plenty of pulling power and will cruise all day at 120 KPH (75 MPH), and still get 20 to 25 MPG.
Seating is comfortable, although the third row seats are only suitable for children under 12 years old (not a lot of leg room), the first and second row are as comfortable as any sedan.
Some people may dislike the fact that the 4WD must be selected manually below 60MPH, unlike the Honda CR-V which automatically selects 4WD when it loses traction , however I prefer being able to manually select 4WD when I want it, and not when the computer chip thinks I should have it.
Overall a nice compromise between a Wagon and a gas-guzzling full-size 4WD.
