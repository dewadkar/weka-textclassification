            I bought this camera two years ago, because photography has been an art form for me for nearly 40 years, and this camera was to add detail to form. I believed the products specs, and it is true.  The detail is fantastic, color reproduction is terrific, and the quality of picture you get depends on the capabilities of your computer system and printer. 
 I should further define my form of art for you to explain how I use this camera: it is mainly to lock down an image until my little pea brain can do something with it. Polaroids are a waste of time to me:( or I have never spent more than 200 dollars for one ) Time is of the essence, since I have little to spare, convenience becomes the main reason I am slightly disappointed. 

To be very honest with you, I have two digital cameras that I find easier to use:  One of the early Ricohs, and the Sony Mavica, which I will review later. The batteries are eaten so quickly by the energy needs of this camera that I am always looking for a place to plug the adapter...not easy to find in the Colorado wilderness for example!!! Secondly, the limited memory capabilities of the original set up. Frankly it is a pain in the rear to download and edit, and delete, as well as to pay another 200 dollars for an adequate flash card.  SO..love the images, but, I think it was a little overrated for its capabilities and convenience. I paid retail prices for this model, now, alas, already outdone by a later model!! I have also found it to be somewhat fragile...don't hang it around your neck when you go rock climbing!

I have recently bought a couple of mini dv digital camcorders and I think they will be better suited for my uses, which I freely admit, may not be the same as the average family photographer. I do some portrait work in my spare time, and I will admit that this camera has its uses.  While I have my 35 millimeter cameras, and only WISH I could afford a Hasselblad, the Kodak works as well as more expensive models. <br><br>
