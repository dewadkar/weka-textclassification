            So I finally made the decision to buy a digital camera.  So like any normal human being these days, I decided to check about 400 internet sites first to see which one was the best deal.  I had finally made up my mind on this HP camera because it was cheap, had a lot of features, and since I was only going to be taking casual here-and-there pictures, this seemed to fit the bill perfectly!

Let me run down the specs of this camera real quick before I continue -- This camera features 2.31 megapixel resolution, the highest I've seen on a camera at this price point; 8MB memory which again is pretty good for this price range; 2x digital zoom; a nifty 1.75" backlit color LCD screen for viewing/managing photos (more on this later); auto focus; a number of flash modes; a CompactFlash slot for more memory; and the necessary cables/software to connect to your PC.

After coming home with this camera, I did what any person excited to have a new toy does.  Toss everything else aside, load it up with batteries, and start snapping!  Immediately I noticed the auto-focus going to work each time I took a picture, as well as the flash compensating for the light in certain situations.  I took the maximum 17 pictures at the 2nd highest resolution, and immediately connected it to my PC to download them.  Installing the software was super-easy, and in about 2 minutes the pictures were downloading to the installed software.  The software it includes isn't too bad for viewing of the pictures, but if you're going to do any editing/resizing of the photos, I reccommend you download a free editor like IrfanView to do this.  Or, if you've already got a more high-powered image editor (i.e. Photoshop) on your PC, you can use that as well.  The speed of the download was very fast, due to the USB cable, so this made me happy as well.  The pictures came out looking pretty good, some were very dark, and I attribute that to the flash not being able to make up its mind whether or not it wanted to use itself or not.  Remember, this is a cheaper camera, so some pictures are not going to turn out perfect.  However, a lot of them will, and this is a definite plus.  The quality of the pictures that came out good was insane.  Once you get the handle for dealing with different lighting situations, etc. this camera will surprise you with its great quality.  Next, I used the digital zoom to take some up close pictures of some objects.  A lot of the time, the camera was "Unable to focus" with the zoom, which left the object in the picture a little blurry.  However, fiddling with the distance vs. zoom, most times you are able to get a good focus and a good picture using the zoom.  The LCD screen is a nice feature, and something I use often to get an exact image of what I'm looking at, rather than guessing with the viewfinder.  Let me rephrase -- I never use the viewfinder. :-)  The LCD screen was an absolute necessity for me when purchasing a digital camera, as I've used some in the past where the viewfinder cuts off some of the image you're taking, and this camera is no exception.  Using the viewfinder will only get you 85% of the image you're looking at.  It's best to use the LCD screen to get an exact view of what the picture you're snapping is.

There's only a few bad points about this camera, but there kind of has to be, as it's not the perfect piece of electronics.  Number one is the battery life.  The low battery life is directly related to the heavy use of the LCD screen.  The more you use the screen, the quicker your batteries get sucked up.  I average about 4 batteries per 100 pics using the LCD screen.  My best reccommendation here is to use rechargable batteries.  I'll be purchasing some soon, because the cost of 4 batteries every 100 photos or so is going to be far more than the initial outlay for rechargeables.  The fact that this camera has no lens cover is somewhat of a pain, but now I'm more or less nit-picking.  Clean the dust off of the lens before you take pictures, and you'll be okay!  Finally, the amount of time it takes for the picture to be taken after you press the button is kind of long.  You have to get used to this delay to truly take great photos with this camera, as it is somewhat annoying in the beginning.

Overall, I feel that this HP Photosmart 318 is an awesome camera.  I bought it at Circuit City on an "Open Box Buy" for $119, it normally retails for $159-$199.  Even at that price, you really can't go wrong.  High megapixel resolution, digital zoom, auto-flash, auto-focus, LCD screen, all for this price??  Some may think it's too good to be true, but it's not folks, go get this camera.  You'll thank me. :-)
