            I bought a 1998 Pontiac Sunfire and had nothing but trouble.  Let me explain.
The engineering just didn't seem to be there.  On the exterior, the hood looks to be open all of the time, the moonroof rattled, leaked, and jammed, the gascap door didn't line up with the rest of the quarter-panel, and that Sunfire spoiler - haven't they cancelled that yet?
On the interior, things weren't much better.  The drivers side sun visor cannot be put down all the way without nearly removing the rear view mirror.  The drink holder cannot hold the ever-so-common 20 oz bottle.  For that matter, the drink holder cannot hold ANY drink if the car (automatic) is in park.
I would recommend people steer clear of this car.  It may be a bright color and look sleek, but it is a mound of trouble.
In this case, you will get what you pay for.
