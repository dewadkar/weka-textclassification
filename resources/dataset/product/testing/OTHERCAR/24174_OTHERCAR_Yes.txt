                 I bought this vehicle for many reasons.  The main reason is because I got a great price and I like the stylish body.  The rims are a shiny $200 a piece chrome.  I love the fact this is a manual transmission.  I also love the gun steel gray color.  The 6 speed turbo charged engine is a real kicker.  I hate the interior.  It doesn't match the outside color, but it is still a great car.  This vehicle can get you into trouble for speeding if you don't watch out.  Almost any person could buy this $22,000 car if they aren't worried about the insurance prices.  I don't recommend this car to the financially challenged folks.  <br><br>
