            When we needed a new car to drive to and from work my wife kept talking about the good luck she had with her 91' cavalier.  Even after reminding her all of the money we put into that car to keep it on the road.  

GM was offering a $2000.00 cash back on 2000 cavaliers so I took a look, thought the car was very basic, but what I really did not like was how cheap the interior was, cheap plastic everything, and the seats are the worst car seats I have ever experienced.

So my wife talked me into buying this car for our everyday, back and forth to work car.  Two days after we got it home I started to notice fluid spots under the car it was leaking trans fluid so I had to take it back to the dealer.  A week later I was cleaning the interior and noticed a spot on the carpet, well it wasn't a spot the carpet was coming off the backing, back to the dealer.  

We now have 9000 miles on the car and the brake rotors are warped already. Dealer informed me that rotors are not covered.  We drive all highway miles and don't ride the brakes.

The car listed for 15,950.00 and I paid 12,500.00  I just hope it last at least three years. <br><br>
