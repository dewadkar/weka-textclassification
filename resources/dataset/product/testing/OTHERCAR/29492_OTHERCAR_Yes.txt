                 I wanted a digital camera so that I wouldn't have to buy film, develop pictures, find some place to store them, or have to scan the pictures once I had them just to put them back into a computer.
I bought the DC 240 to replace my original DC 210 Plus camera that a friend dropped. I was VERY pleased with the 210. The DC 240 is even better!

     My experience has been very good with this camera. It is extremely simple to operate and fun to use. I took over 1000 pics with my DC 210+ and since I got the DC 240, have taken about 1500 pics since Christmas '99.
     Some people like getting pictures and all, but personally, I do NOT like spending money on expensive film and development and then I can�t stand storing them. With a digital camera, you just copy the images to a computer and then you can store them there, or, like I do, periodically back them up onto a CD. I have racked up about 2500+ images in a 1 1/2 year period.
     It is great; I can log onto the net wherever I am, say at a vacationing hotel room, and email the day's images to family and friends. No development, no scanning, it is all done in a few mins worth of time.
     The battery life, as others complain about only lasting an hour or is, has lasted ME up to a full week of heavy usage. The trick? Don�t use the LCD screen to take pictures. You haven�t used one in the last 100 something years that cameras have been around, and you wont miss it now. The nice thing is this, and the other Kodak models, come with an optical viewer. Many other cameras� do not, such as Sony's, where I overheard someone bragging about how they made their batteries last a whole 2 hours, then I just had to tell him mine lasted over a week. He was not happy with my saving that. So I give props to Kodak for making an optical viewer. Another battery saver is the fact that it uses the little memory cards. There are no moving parts for the memory cards, unlike Sony's floppy drive, which sucks battery life even more. The final battery plus is the fact that it takes regular batteries! Either use 4 rechargeable AA's or use just regular AA batteries to operate. So you just carry batteries with you and reload when they die, unlike other cameras that use proprietary rechargeable batteries only, where they can get stuck in the middle of the day with dead batteries and have nowhere to plug in to.
     The memory cards are awesome. It comes with an 8MB card, and you can store anywhere from 60+ 800x600 images to 15 or so 1280x1024 images (there is also a 1024x768 option) If you own a laptop, the $12 (check eBay) PCMCIA adapter is a MUST HAVE item. When I fill up all my memory (I have 2 8MB cards and a 32MB card, that�s about 200+ medium quality images) I just boot up my laptop (which I keep in the car, or at a hotel, etc) and empty them all off. Then I am ready for another couple hundred images.
     Another cool thing about the memory cards is that a variety of camera's use them, and, with the PCMCIA adapter, ALL laptops automatically recognize them as just another hard drive. SO you can store data on it as well. I have copied some MP3s and documents onto one and then stuck it in my wallet to take to a friend's house. Also a few Windows CE palmtops take the memory cards.
     I took this camera to the Grand Canyon and went camping; it got all dirty and dusty and kept on working great. It was banged around and still kept on taking great hi-res images. Then I went to Vegas and took pictures in all sorts of environments, with and without flash, Day and Night. The daytime and indoor images are excellent. The night images aren�t that great though, but I think that is something all cameras have a problem with. Other than that, I took about 750 pictures of my vacation on a 1-week period. I believe I went through 3-4 sets of batteries, which is STILL cheaper than film developing.
     
     The only thing I DO NOT like about the DC 240 is the fact that it only seems to use the Duracell Ultra batteries (they have a blue stripe on them). They do not cost much more than regular batteries, but not everyone carries these. It requires higher voltage batteries to run it. I also tried using Energizer Advanced Formula batteries, and it only lasted a little bit and then died. So far only the Duracell Ultra's seem to work, giving me a few days to over a week worth of life. SO I just buy a few packs if I am going to be away for a period of time.

     What if you like Creative Memories? Do one of two things: Print them out in WHATEVER size you want, or use publishing software (MS Publisher, etc) to get the same results.

     By spending the $500 and an additional $100 for a 32MB memory card (with an included USB card reader) I have SAVED roughly $5000 in film and developing in the 2 years I have owned the DC 210+ and the DC 240.

     I love this camera. Buy one, or one like it. Kodak makes an excellent digital camera.

***** Update January 2001*****
The Zoom Lens some how lost a tooth in the gearing, it goes almost 75% out and starts jumping gears, so I have to �help� the lens all the way out, but it still works great. I will be sending it in to Kodak for warranty repairs.
