            After I had purchased 5 used vehicles in 5 years, and putting more than $15,000 into upkeep and repairs, I decided to look at a new car.  It was purely by chance I was standing in the used car lot at Incredible Auto in Billings, MT when I turned to the salesman and asked him... "What kind of deal can you make me on a new KIA?"  And so the story begins.  

This was in July of 2000 and I remembered I had heard several comments on KIAs.  Some fair, but mostly were good.  After wheeling and dealing for about 45 min, I drove off the lot with a brand new 2000 Violet Mist KIA Sephia, with an snazzy-looking wood dash kit from the factory (really spices up the interior!).  

Then and now (out here at least) KIAs come with a 10 year/100,000 mile Power Train warranty and an additional 5 year/36,000 mile roadside assistance warranty.  I drive 140 miles each day just to get to and from work and home.  This is why I needed an economical and trust-worthy vehicle.  My first tank of gas I got 36 MPG.  Since then it has averaged out to 26-30 MPG.  (This is winter gas, and this is with starting the car and leaving it running for 10-45 min while I'm in the store, house, or it's warming up.  These are necessary actions in -40 deg. weather).

The only drawbacks I have experienced since I bought the car was that the paint on the hood (NOT warranted) chipped very easily.  After 3 weeks (approx. 900 miles) there were numerous rock chips in the paint.  How do you fix it?  I bought a front-end mask that really sharpens the look of this car up a lot and also added protection for the paint.  Also, after about 10,000 miles I noticed that my gas mileage was significantly dropping.  Last Friday night my "CHECK ENGINE" light turned on and later went off again.  I took it to the dealership and the O2 (Oxygen)Sensor is faulty.  Easy to fix, still safe to drive, and part will be in early next week.  No sweat.  The stereo isn't the highest quality and there are NO wire harnesses made for installing after-market decks, however a reliable shop will T-Tap into the existing harness with little or no trouble.

I am not the wealthiest of people, and cannot afford the time or money required to maintain another used vehicle, and haven't had to do so!  I would say, I got a GREAT car for a GREAT price, without compromising anything.
