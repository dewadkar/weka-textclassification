            I was searching for a camera providing good value, high quality pictures, compactness, a USB port, a zoom lens and most importantly, relative ease of use. After considerable research I found it 'all' in my first digital camera. I am only an occasional camera user and this camera is used primarily for real estate projects and property shots and my wife uses it for Ebay Auction items. The camera has met or exceeded all of our expectations, in fact so much so that I wanted other consumers to know. I'm sure there are other good cameras out there, but this is one that has all the good features and value for money as well. On the usual battery problem, I purchased two after market recharge kits and always have fresh batteries available. I also find the AC plug in adaptor to be handy when downloading on the computer. The combination has totally solved the typical short life battery irritant with digital cameras. One very pleased consumer!
