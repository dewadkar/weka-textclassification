            I bought a Dodge NEON ES with ABS,Alloys,Full package except sunroof and am very pleased with this car.I shopped around for a car looking at Honda,Toyota,Volkswagen,and of course,Dodge. After taking a test drive in each and comparing value for money and the handling an acceleration of each car, I picked the NEON.

The key to enjoying this car if you are going for performance is a) get the 5-speed transmission b)get the ABS and alloy option which come with higher performance tires.I had a exceedingly hard time getting 5-speed,but was glad that I did.It shifts very smoothly and the gears are well chosen for the engine.

Ok the pros and cons. This car will put a big smile on your face if driven fast and on a road that is twisty and lonely.NONE of the other higher priced imports can match its performance...,NONE OF THEM! The 2000
NEON seems to be the &quot;finished&quot; product that Chrysler intended for the public. It's fit and finish are good,the interior is well appointed and has logically (except A/C!) arranged controls. On mine, wind noise is negligible,and I have not detected any squeaks or rattles.

Many magazines complain about the engine noise,but I find it to be normal considering the performance of the unit.I expected to hear a cacophony of engine/wind noise at 70MPH, but did not. Maybe this is due to me, or the 5-speed ,or luck, but the negative reviews on engine noise/wind noise seem unjustified.

The cons. The remotely actuated trunk latch will not pop up easily unless one places the spring in the furthermost hole (there are two holes).The seats are good but are like a &quot;magnet&quot; , making it difficult to squirm around for a better position. They could also have more support under the legs (a little bit more seat please!)They are not that bad though.

All in all a great little car. First US made car, I've owned in my forty plus years of life and I am impressed. Long term reliability/value.., I cannot say what that will be (probably less than imports),but this car is excellent value/performance for the money.
