               I bought my Neon because I needed a car.  My last car was a 1988 Toyota Tercel in so bad of shape that when I drove it into the dealership I could not see out my windows because of all the smoke pouring from every conceivable outlet on the underside of my car, but that is another review.

	Obviously, <b>any</b> car would have greatly improved my transportation status at the time.  However, I have always like the Neon's cute body style (love those little oval head lights =), the Neon is cheap, it has great gas mileage and the are fun to drive.
	
	So, I bought a 1996 4 door, 5 speed.  I bought it in 1999 with only 40 thousand miles on it.  I have brought that up  to over 65 in a year (I drive a lot).   A month after I bought the car it developed a mysterious oil leak, I had a warranty so I took it to the dealer to be fixed.  The dealer cheerfully reported to me that there was damage in the oil pan, the &quot;oil-pressure sender switch&quot; was broken, and the head gasket needed to be replaced, the cam shaft needed something and it would cost me, with a warranty/maintenance contract that covered repairs, over $1,500.00.  The only thing covered by this maintenance contract was the head gasket and the cam shaft, this would cost me only $50.  I opted for the lesser of the two and have not had a single problem with my oil since.  Plus, this goes to show what this dealer knew, I later had a mechanic (he was changing the oil for me) tell me that there was no damage in or to my oil pan.

	 I really, really love my car.  It drives smooth, accelerates fast, can go really fast, has great stopping ability, it has never left me stranded (the needle on the gas tank can go <i>well</i> below E).

	However much I want to defend this car and go on about how great it is, there are some problems with it, minor problems such as:

	*	Squeaky brakes, even when there is plenty of              pad/shoe left
	*	Poor visibility when backing up (especially if you are very short)
	*	Water will flood you in the face if you roll down the drivers side window in the rain or 		while using the windshield cleaner.
	*	Mysterious noises will occur from the engine with no mechanical explanation

	I would only be able to recommend this car to someone if they did not drive a lot (more than 25,000 a year) and you are not very short (those darn blind spots!).  But if you love to drive and you like small cars and don't have a lot of $$$  say HI.<br><br>
