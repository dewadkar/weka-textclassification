            I bought this camera in October of last year.  I really had a lot of fun with.  But it was hard for me to get really good pictures on it.  I took pictures with it at my daughters wedding in November.  I was really disappointed in the pictures.  Thankfully she had a photographer.  

This camera is great for fun, things that are not important.  I discovered that the cheap scanner I had purchased a year ago scanned much better pictures than my digital camera took.  I suppose it depends on what you need the pictures for.

I chose the Sony because they are a good brand name.  I liked the fact that it used a disk and I could just put the disk in my computer and add them to my picture album.  I love pictures.  

It has a rechargeable battery that charges up to a couple of hours.  It is capable of taking a good picture in the BMP file format.  But that is one picture per disk.  It mostly takes pictures in the JPG format, and also smaller pictures for email.  That is really nice if you want to send pictures to your family and friends over the internet.

If you like a camera that is fun, and you like to see your picture right away then this is the camera for you.  If you want a good quality picture then this is not the camera for you.
