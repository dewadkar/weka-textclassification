               My wife and i needed a dependable and safe car to carry are daughter.
We didn't want to pay for a new car but we also wanted a car that we new would last. I have always heard good things about Toyotas so we went with the Camry for the room. The ride is quit and extremely smooth. You feel like you could drive in a nascar race it handles so well. The sound system is great and the controls are all with in reach of the driver. The first problems is with the middle console. the cover to it has broken off and the latch as also broken. my car was out of warranty and when i talked to the dealer they had had problems with this in a lot of the Camrys. when our camry reached just 60,000 miles it developed a valve seal leak. I took it to the dealer and toyota would only pay half since it was 2,000 miles out of warrenty. only a n $800 fix. also haven problems withe the a/c too.<br><br>
