                I finally got my hands on this thing and all I have to say is that I love it.  Since I need at least a 100 words, I'll write more!  Once I turned this on it was easy.  The interface is nice and simple.  You have your menu and then you have the directional pad to make your decisions.  Taking pictures is a snap with this thing.  You have choices of flash, auto flash, and red eye reduction.  After taking your pictures, you can view them on your LCD.  From there you have options such as magnifying the picture, erasing it, viewing all your pics as thumbnails, rotating them, and locking them.  When locking a picture you like, you can't delete it by accident which is a pretty useful feature.  Since it's only $300 which is pretty cheap compared to alot others, you won't get a great amount of features, but it's more than enough for a starter camera.
    This camera is great for just having around the house and for going out.  I'm always out with friends and we always take pictures.  I thought I'd try out the digital cameras for once since me and my friends are always on the internet and I can just send them via e-mail.  Also what I love about this camera is that for $300 you get 2.1 megapixels.  If you look at alot of brands out there, I'm not sure how many give you 2.0 for that much.  A lot I've seen only have about 1.3 megapixels.  When displaying your picture on the back of your LCD, it might not look that good.  Once you get it on your computer is when you really appreciate the quality of this camera.  Believe me, the LCD doesn't do justice.  Once you see the picture on your computer it's just amazing.  
    Well here are the few gripes I have about this camera.  It kills batteries but then I think all cameras with an LCD does.  Also there's the digital zoom.  I wish it was a real zoom and not digital but still digital is ok.  You can't control how far it zooms.  Just goes by normal, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 which is ok I guess.  It doesn't come with an ac adapter which would've been nice.  In fact, you can only get the adapter through Hewlett Packard themselves.  Standard memory card is only 8MB.  On the highest setting this only takes 10 measly pictures.  Buying more isn't much cheaper either.  16MB card costs about $60 and takes about 20 and 32MB about $100 and takes 30 pictures.
    All in all I think this camera is great.  I don't think an adapter is really neceassary.  Rechargable batteries which are cheaper are as good I think.  They're cheaper also so I'll take those over an adapter.  I'm very happy with this camera and if you're looking for something simple, easy to use, and affordable, look no further, this is they way to go.
