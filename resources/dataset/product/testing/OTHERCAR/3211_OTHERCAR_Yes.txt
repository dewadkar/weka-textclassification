            The body has a great finish and is refreshing to see Sony move from Silvery finish to Charcoal finish. Looks and feels better than black colored bodies. Comes with a Lens Cap, and a Belt Strap. Sorry, no camera bag. But sony gives a free $20 gift card to use at their online store on select accessories when you register the camera online. Buy LCM-SX for this camera to keep up with Sony Style.

Everyone talks about their CARL ZEISSï¿½ lense. Well, I don't know much about them until I saw Sony mention about them. Well, I found out they make some of the best camera lenses. No wonder this camera takes great pictures.

The highlight in this camera like most Sony digicams is you are always well informed about the charge left on the battery. This helps me a lot as I have no surprises. Also, this battery is a real energizer bunny. Keeps going and going for a very long time.

The only thing I didn't like about the camera is the small plastic piece they used to cover the charger plug-in. It is very delicate and I am worried it may break sometime soon.

The prices on Memory Stick are dropping fast and there is no reason to be worried about the cost of it. Realistically, how many Sticks do we need to buy? These are not something we need to buy forever! I have 2 128 MB Memory sticks (one from Sony and the other from Lexar) and never needed to use the second one till now as I always upload my pictures.

Please note to change the flash option to HIGH for night photography to take better pictures instead of the default AUTO mode.
