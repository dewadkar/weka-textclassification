            I'll start off with the quantitative, since that's less subjective, and move into quality. The three most important quantities, at a glance, are probably size, megapixels/resolution, and memory size.


* Size and weight: 1.6 in. x 2.3 in. 3.9 in. -- .45 lb -- Very good! The rule is generally that large, bulky cameras that lack portability and ease of use provide the widest range of features. This unit proves to be just the opposite, packing in more features than much of its current competition in a very small body.


* 4.13-megapixel CCD, still images up to 2288 x 1712 pixels -- Again, very good resolution, and excellent at 4 megapixels. This over-suites professional business applications and is perfect for the professional photographer or artist. Other resolutions include 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, 640 x 480, a very nice and versatile range.


* Included Memory Size 16 MB: Memory Type Built in, SD/MMC Memory Cards Compatible. With large-resolution pictures, a good supply of memory is a must, and it's delivered with an included 16mb card, and is compatible with SD/MMC.
 


I've tested out both the 550 and 450, and overall I'm very impressed with the quality of both, but my personal pick is the 450. Despite the compact size, both cameras feature a high performance 5X optical zoom lens with 4X digital for an impressive 20X combined zoom. Both cameras are capable of recording up to 10 minutes of video with sound at 15 frames per second with 320 x 240 recorded pixels. This is still not quite reasonable, in my humble opinion, but in comparison to everything else on the market this is quite a leap in quality. They also record audio, and 30 second voice memos can be attached to still images or they can be used as standalone voice recorders. Usually I shirk at these add-ons, but for some reason the additional features had me toying around endlessly. The primary difference between the two cameras, however, would have to be in the video itself--the 550 is purported to have some minor distortion when played via television sets, and I noticed this in my model. The 450 had no such distortion, a good sign that they have probably been listening to consumers. However, this is a very minor flaw overall, and does not negate the value of the 550 at all.


The real area where this camera shines (either the 450 or the 550) is in what matters most, taking an accurate picture. I'm not the most brilliant photographer in the world, but when I take a picture I want what I see to be taken, not something else. As an artist I seek objects to manipulate and entwine with other mediums, and I got nothing but perfect snapshots with the 550. First off, the color LCD monitor offers 100% view of the frame, which helps ensure easier, more accurate image composition and allows you to review recent shots. Intuitive interval shooting lets you set the start time, the duration of the interval between shots, and the number of frames, and capture events that take place over an extended period of time. Multiple exposure function allows surreal creativity such as double images in the same shot. Macro shooting modes allows shots from as close as 5.9 inches and super macro mode as close as .79 inches (.02m). Very good!

Finally, where I normally tweak in Photoshop--the digital filter mode gives you the freedom to influence the overall tone of your shot. With choices of black & white, sepia and other tones (red, pink, yellow, green, blue and purple), the digital filter mode lets you add ambience to a photo or tone down those that are too bright. The soft filter provides for the same old soft focus effect that used to be achieved by covering the lens with a medium material such as a type of liquid of thin paper. For even greater control over the image, the Optio 550 and 450 allow sharpness, saturation and contrast to be set manually with a choice of three settings for each. Less tweaky settings include daylight, shade, tungsten light, and flourescent light settings for those who prefer the tried-and-true. The shutter, too, has immense flexibility ranging from 4 - 1/4000 seconds. Usually you get a tilt in one end of the scale, not both!

Finally, the camera is built to last you quite a while, both per session and for life. The purported 400 images per charge is quite accurate, and the unit includes a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and a charger too! For the first time, I was able to go on multiple image-hunts without having to replace or recharge batteries. In regards to the durability, I'm not exactly about to test it out--but the case is crafted from lightweight but strong aluminum alloy, and all edges and curves have good structural reinforcements.

I've tested many cameras out, and borrowed many from friends in the profession--but I've rarely bought one without very carefully considering everything involved. This one tips the scales. Again, my choice for both the monetary value and the unit is the 450, but you cannot go wrong with either purchase.
