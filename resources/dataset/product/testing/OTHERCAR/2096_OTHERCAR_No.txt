            In March of 1999, my boyfriend and I purchased a 1990 Pontiac Sunbird Convertible. We live in Arizona so it was nice to have a convertible. We paid $1,900 dollars for the car. It had a 4-cylinder engine in it, automatic transmission and about 104,000 miles on it. We thought we were getting a pretty good deal. Little did we know we were very wrong.

We have taken the car on many road trips. It currently has 126,000 miles on it and problems galore. About 2 months ago after returning from a 2,000-mile road trip the car broke down. I went outside to start it and nothing happened. My boyfriend began to analyze the problem. He called my dad, who has been a mechanic for 25 years, and told him what it was doing wrong. We finally came to the conclusion that the timing was off. 

We went and bought a new belt and my boyfriend replaced it and then fixed the timing. It worked for about two days and then the timing was off again. We went back to the store and bought new spark plugs and wires. This also worked for about two days. We then bought a distributor cap and that fixed the problem.

Now we had a new problem. The car would overheat very rapidly. Now I know I am in Arizona, but this still should not have been happening. We went out and bought a new thermostat. That seemed to keep the car cooler for longer, but it would still overheat. We deiced we would just have to take it slower and that seemed to help.

Now it has another strange problem. When I go out in the morning to start it, it will start and stall a few times. Then once I getting it running and pull out of the driveway, all the emergency lights will come on, the gauges will all fall and the clocks will reset. The car stays running. This only happens in the morning when I first start it. It is kind of scary. I can't afford to take it into a shop; my boyfriend is trying to analyze this problem. So far we have had no luck.

I have found this car to be the worst purchase I have ever made. I will never buy another Pontiac in my entire life. I should have bought a dodge, but I couldn't find one when I needed a vehicle. I warn you now, if you are looking to buy a 1990 Pontiac Sunbird, DON'T! It isn't worth the money.
