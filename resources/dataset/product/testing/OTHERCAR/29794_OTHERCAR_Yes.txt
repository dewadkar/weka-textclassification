            My Kodak DC260 is my constant companion. The quality and color balance are good. The convenience of immediate &quot;processing&quot; with my San Disk flash card reader and my HP Colorsmart 1100 ink jet printer is fantastic! Contrary to published figures, I can blow up a &quot;best&quot; quality picture to an acceptable 8&quot;X10&quot; glossy or matte presentation quality photograph.

I chose the Kodak 260 becaus a friend had recommended it. It MUST be used with rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries, since you can only take 5 or 6 pictures with the conventional cells, but I regularly get 30 or more pictures from a freshly charged set of the metal hydrides. I carry an extra charged set with me.

I also have an extra 32MB flash card, which gives me about 80 pictures in the &quot;best&quot; mode and over 200 pictures in the &quot;better&quot; mode. I don't use the &quot;standard&quot; mode, but I guess it's OK for posting on the web or sending in e-mails.

The one feature that doesn't work as advertised is the multiple snap shot. The processing rate of the camera is slow, and I cannot get more than two multiple pictures. The newest version of this camera is the DC 265, which I am told, is an improvement over the 260. 

I recently bought a DC 240 for my grandson, and this is also an excellent instrument, lacking the audio capture, which is really not necessary, unless the user has a specific need for that feature.<br><br>
