            I took it on rental for a week last year. We drove around mostly in city &amp; then on a long drive to North Carolina from Tennessee. It was the most comfortable drive I had ever have. easily maneuverable on big highways with firm grip &amp; steady ride. Easy to tackle in inner city. spacious back seats can easily accommodate 2 baby car seats and still have room for an average size person. trunk is also very roomy &amp; can take 2 extra large suitcase. Not sure of exact gas consumption but it wasn't much considering it's a big car. Front seat are very comfortable too. 
If i will ever think of buying a large size car intrepid would be sure on top of my list. Also I can easily recommend it to  my friends.<br><br>
