            I have a small vending business and thought the LOW PRICE was attractive enough to satisfy my needs. Since the vehicle does not have power doors or windows it is difficult and time consuming when making stops which require securing the contents. The right door lock or window crank cannot be reached from the drivers seat even though I have long arms. When needing to secure the doors each one must be locked individually which is very time consuming. Since I make approximately 30 stops per day I feel I am wasting a lot of valuable time. TIME IS MONEY!<br>Ease of entrance and exiting the vehicle are a plus as is the left hand side door. <br><br>Engine is economical and &quot;peppy&quot;and the ride quality is good.<br><br>AM VERY SORRY I DID NOT SPEND A COUPLE THOUSAND MORE FOR AUTOMATIC LOCKS AND WINDOWS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
