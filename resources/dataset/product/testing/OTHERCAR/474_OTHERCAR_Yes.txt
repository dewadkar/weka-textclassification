            I've had this LS for six months now and I have really enjoyed the comfort, sportiness, and reliability of it. 

I love the body design except for that when it is wet in any way and you have a window cracked the slightest bit the moisture will pour in the window from the windshield and directly into the electric window controls. That has already cost me one set of controls.

The car drives very well. Handling is good. Could have more power but what car couldn't. The biggest problem with these cars is the brakes are too small for the weight and they quickly become noisy and produce large amounts of dust.

I can't think of anyone who shouldn't buy this car. It has class, luxury, and sport in an easy to maintain and sporty chassis.
