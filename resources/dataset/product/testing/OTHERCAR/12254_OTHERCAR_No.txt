            Well.  First things first, this car looks a lot more expensive than it should.  Beautiful exterior, nice wood trim interior, and overall it just looks sharp!  One thing about this car, being in the same class as a Ford Taurus or even Toyota Camry, is that it catches your eye a lot more than either of those 2 cars.  Plus its a lot cheaper too.  The handling is decent for a large sedan, and its a relatively smooth and quiet ride.  But i guess that's where all the positives end.  Not having much to spend a lot on a new car,I opted to not go for the V6 model with anti-lock brakes.  Instead my car is a 4 cylindar with front disc brakes and rear drums brakes.  I've had this car for less than 2 years, and already I've had to get the front rotors machined down twice because of pretty bad vibration from the steering wheel.  Once was under warranty, however the second time took 150 bucks out of my pocket.  I dont use the brake pedal excessively, so I am perplexed how they could wear so quickly.  The 4 cylindar engine is also a cause for concern.  I mean its enough to get you hear and there with enough zip to pass through people.  But I guess ive just been used to higher powered cars and was disappointed on its 30-40 mph acceleration.  Especially on a merger the car seemed like it would go nowhere.  I guess if your thinking about buying this car, definately look into getting the V-6 option with anti-lock brakes.  I know its an expensive upgrade, but down the road I think you'll be much happier you got it, rather than regretting it later.<br><br>
