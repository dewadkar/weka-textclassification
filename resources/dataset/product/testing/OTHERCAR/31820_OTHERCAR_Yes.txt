            Man...I have spent 6 months looking for a car that was affordable, practical (needed to park in Cambridge) and had a good record.  After test driving and almost purchasing the VW Jetta...I was taken back by the price, and the poor warranty offering (2 yrs 24,000 miles).  When I talked to my colleagues at work they all said &quot;Go Honda!&quot;  They said it will last 10 yrs, and they are fun to drive.

I just bought a silver Honda Civic Value Package model (DX with auto, cd, and auto locks) and I am so happy I made the right choice.

What I love:

Engine:
I could not believe how fun this little 1.6 liter engine was.  It was quick, and great on gas mileage.  Perfect for city driving.

Interior:
Good amount of room in the front.  Plenty of head space and a pleasing interior.

Body:
Buying a silver civic, even though I paid a little more than the green model, was well worth the money.  Everybody says it looks sharp, and the color will never go out of style.

Safety;
Dual airbags, but no abs with the Value package.

Ride:
Very smooth...I love it.  However, when the A/C is on full blast it takes away from the pick up of the car a little.  This is one of the few things I do not like.

Gas mileage:
35 mpg, what else can you say?

What I dislike:

Back seat:
The back seat is meant for throwing stuff in the back and for infants.  It is really small, but I do not have a family, so I don't sweat it.

All in all this is a car for people just out of college, living in a city where a long commute is not needed.  This is not a family car, and it is not a car to go hot-rodding in.  If you like smart cars that hold their value...this is the one for you!

Oh yeah...get the Lo-Jack alarm and save 35% on comprehensive insurance.<br><br>
