            The A4 is Audi's entry into the crowded entry-level luxury market, and as such it competes directly with the BMW 3 series, the Lexus 330is, and the Acura TSX.  Two body styles (sedan and wagon), three engines (1.8L turbo 4, 3.0L V6, and 4.2L V8), four transmissions (5 and 6-speed manual, CVT, and 5-speed automatic) and a choice of front and all-wheel drive are offered.  

The A4's current "B6" chassis is 45% stiffer than the previous generation A4 (whose "B5" chassis is still used by the current VW Passat). The firmer chassis allows for a more solid feel and better suspension tuning.  Like all VW and Audi products except the all-aluminum A8, the A4 uses galvanized steel throughout and carries a 12-year warranty against rust perforation.

The A4 in base form goes out the door with an MSRP of just over $25,000, and in typical German luxury car tradition, for this amount you get a somewhat stripped vehicle.  Expect to drop an additional $2625 for the premium and cold weather packages to get the things that most people expect in an entry-level luxury car (i.e. leather, power moon roof, heated power seats, etc.)  Once you've optioned up an A4 this way, it's a luxurious car which has features many of its competitors don't offer (i.e. interior pass-through with "ski sock", first aid kit, heated mirrors and headlamp washers with heated nozzles).  

Other options worth considering are 17" sport wheels with 235/45/R17 Pirelli P6 all-season tires ($500) and a Bose stereo system with XM or Sirius satellite radio ($1000-1225, depending on trim level). While some people will  spring for the lighting package ($750, including auto-leveling xenon headlamps and auto-dimming rearview mirror), the standard headlamps seem plenty powerful to me.  Steer clear of the optional sport suspension ($750) unless you are a hard-core enthusiast, as it is abusively harsh on all but glass-smooth surfaces.

The subject of this review is an A4 1.8T MT5 with the premium, cold weather and Bose packages, as well as the 17" sport wheel and a satellite radio upgrades.  After price negotiations with the dealer, the car came in at about $28,600, or 3% over invoice.  What kind of car do you get for that kind of money?

The A4 in this configuration is a very capable highway cruiser and canyon-carver, with plenty of mid-range oomph and superb handling.  The standard suspension offers a good compromise between compliance and handling, and the optional sport wheels (shod with 235/45/R17 Pirelli P6s) have plenty of grip.  Seat-of-pants communication from the car is terrific, and the electronic nannies kick in only when required.

While certainly adequate around town (0-60 goes by in 7.8 seconds), the A4 really shines on the open road. With the manual, there is no real "turbo lag," just a sensation of being propelled ever more rapidly that builds above 2,000 RPM.  Shifts are smooth, with short throws and precise feel, though the clutch does have longish travel. 

While the stock 1.8T has 170 horsepower and 166 ft/lb of torque from the factory, several aftermarket options are available for increasing performance. One of the best examples I've seen is APR's Direct Port Programming, which offers the ability to switch between engine control programs at the touch of a button, including one that boosts output to 196 horsepower and 229 ft/lb of torque with stock mechanicals, maintaining a natural, progressive feel with very little turbo lag. More info about APR's solution is available at www.goapr.com.

Before moving off of the drivetrain, some suggestions are in order for those considering an A4: The front drive 1.8T with the five-speed manual is a solid choice for an enthusiast, though those getting quattro may want to consider a solution such as the APR one described above to get a bit more power.  The 3.0L engine may be a better choice for those planning to go with an automatic transmission and/or quattro.  Finally, when combined with the standard suspension, the optional sport wheels with all-season tires offer a great compromise between compliance and handling.

As with virtually any other Audi, the A4 has an interior which boasts high quality materials and several thoughtful touches throughout. For example:

* The leather-wrapped steering wheel tilts and telescopes.
* The heated seats have six graduated settings and precise up-down-in-out adjustments for lumbar support. 
* The sunroof has an "accordion" along its sides to ensure that air doesn't rush in when it is cracked open at the trailing edge, and opens fully to let air into the vehicle when desired.
* All four windows have one-touch power down and power up with anti-pinch protection; in addition, the windows and sunroof can be closed by turning the key in the drivers door.
* There is a space under the steering wheel for the owner's manual, so it doesn't tie up space in the glove box. 
* There are hidden storage bins under both the driver's and passenger's seats, as well as in the trunk.
* The fully-lined trunk has a cargo net with tie downs, hooks for grocery bags, a tool kit, a safety reflector and a full-sized spare (which uses the same tire/wheel combination as the rest of the car!).  
* The standard trip computer has several useful functions, such as average MPG, miles to empty, and a reminder to pull over every couple of hours when driving on long trips.
* Standard security systems include a "chipped" key, as well as an alarm system with shock sensor.

Interior quibbles include only one easily accessible front cupholder (the other is hidden in the armrest), only one power outlet in the passenger compartment (though there is another one in the trunk) and a slightly noisy fan on the otherwise effective dual automatic climate control. 

The 10-speaker, 215-watt Bose stereo, which is a necessary upgrade if you want satellite radio without tacking on an aftermarket add-on unit, is well integrated into the rest of the car, taking full advantage of the information display built into the instrument cluster.  It includes a six-disc changer and cassette unit, and has very good sound once you've tweaked the tone controls to your liking for each input source (i.e., CD, radio, cassette, satellite).

Overall, the A4 is a worthy competitor to the BMW 325i and the Acura TSX, and slots inbetween them competitively on price as well.  It offers a rich mix of features, more configuration flexibility than the Acura or the Lexus and more accessible creature comforts than the BMW. 

If you want performance similar to the A4, but $28,000-30,000 is outside your price range, take a look at the VW Jetta GLS 1.8T.  When equipped with a manual transmission and the optional sport suspension, the Jetta is a great car for the enthusiast on a budget, and includes all the important bits, such as a killer sound system and a sunroof, for about $23,000.  At this price, features such as the alarm system with shock sensor, leather interior, trip computer, xenon headlamps and satellite radio are either optional or not available, but at least you'll have all the right bits for an entertaining ride...
