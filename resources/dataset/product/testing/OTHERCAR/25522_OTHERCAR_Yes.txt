            Mazda trucks are pretty good cars, they drive smooth and have great
acceleration.  My uncle has a 1995 which has been to the shop once for
transmission problems but hasn't been back since.  The back cab is pretty
comfortable with sufficient space to move around.  The back bed is 
decent and is big enough to move furniture.  With furniture in the back
the vehicle is still powerful enough to transport with power to go up
hills and to your destination.  Shifting in the car is smooth and goes into
gears very easily, easily enough that the clutch feels like it isn't even
needed.  I recommend this truck for it's power and comfortability.  
Just to add, the front seats are also very comfortable, comfortable enough
to take long road trips.<br><br>
