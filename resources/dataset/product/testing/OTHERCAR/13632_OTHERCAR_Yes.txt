            When my family gathers for birthdays and holidays, the driveway looks like an all-BMW used car lot. There are seven, to be exact: Two newish 5 series, one old 7 series, one new 3 series, and three old 3 series. My dad is a pro at fixing various Beemer aliments, and he'd better be...there are plenty.  

My first car was a 1982 528e, and when it was totaled several years ago (not my fault, mind you), I upgraded to a 1992 325is, two-door, black with black leather interior. It was (and still is), a sweet ride. Excellent fun to drive, attention-getting in a good way, the kind of car you enjoy shining up all afternoon on Saturdays. 

But the more of these early-90s 3 series we amass, the more similar problems come to light. The most notable is the glue thing. All of the door panels are falling off--on my car, my sister's, and my mom's. Our mechanic consultant wryly tells us that the factory had a bout with bad glue in those years. We are not amused.  

Among the other problems: My sunroof only opens 4 inches. The heat only works sporadically, and then only on the highest setting. My muffler is so loud, it sets off other people's car alarms as I roar down the street. As a joke, my little brother once plastered Neuspeed stickers on my windows. 

All these little things are fixable, of course, but for a price I can never seem to afford. Still, I hang on to "Black Beauty," as I call her. After all, she's never left me stranded, even with 215,000 miles on the odometer. And she still looks great. I'm so spoiled by the sturdy, amazing driving experience you get with a BMW, I'd never cave to some bland Honda, or, heaven forbid, Ford Focus. But if I had it to do over, I think I'd get another 5 series. They seem not only bigger, but better-built.
