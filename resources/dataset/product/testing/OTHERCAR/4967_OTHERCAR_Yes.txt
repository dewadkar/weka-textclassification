                 I first saw what was to become the XG 300 at the Philadelphia Auto show in 1999. It was then called the Equus. I looked curiously at this large (for a Hyundai) car sitting on the platform and was disappointed that it was for show only, you could not sit in it. The next year, it had changed names and was available for inspection. I was immediately impressed with the long list of standard features and the sticker price just knocked me out. This year, with the 0% financing, I decided to take a test drive. I am glad that I did. It turned me on to an incredible value, that I am appreciating more with each day I drive it.
    
    Front and side air bags, traction control, pre-tensor seat belts ( they tighten to hold you against the seat in a collision), and 4 wheel ABS Disc brakes make safety one of the big reasons I bought this car.  These are standard  yet some of these items are not even offered on other makes in this price range.

    The 5 speed automatic transmission is the smoothest shifting one I have ever had the pleasure to drive. Slip it into the "manual" gate and you can control the shift points to give a sportier feel. Even in the "manual" gate, however, you cannot overrev the engine or upshift to too high a gear to make the engine drag, as it is electronically blocked. Shifts while cornering while in "D" come a bit late, so if you like to push it through the corner a bit, you will definitely need to use the manual gate. The engine itself is extremely quiet during normal acceleration and cruising (even at 70 mph), but exhibits a slight growl under hard acceleration (not at all unpleasant, though). This certainly is not the fastest car on the block, but it is more than adequate for most drivers. The flip side to that is that gas mileage is pretty good for a car of this size, I am averaging in the low to mid 20's in suburban driving. The 2002 will have a 3.5 liter 194 hp engine upgrade. Ride quality is more to the highway cruiser type, hardly a pothole or bump will jar you. Handling is a bit mushy due to this, comparable to my Chrysler Town & Country minivan. The complaint about the "little" wheels has been rectified, as the XG300 now comes with standard 16" wheels (Michelin tires).

     I have read some of the other reviews here, and wonder if these people have actually driven the car. One complained of "tight head room with the moon roof". I am 6'5" and usually have trouble fitting into cars of Asian descent. This is the only one I have sat in with a moon roof that I can actually fit in with no problems. My head does not touch the roof liner even with the moon roof liner closed. Leg room is adequate for me, and someone can actually sit behind me in the back seat. The 6 way adjustable power seat is very comfortable, but lacks enough lateral support for hard cornering. The leather is nice and smells good to me ( I don't know where they got the "plastic fumes" from). In fact the interior in general is well put together. The trip computer is kind of useless, giving miles until empty and miles driven as the only useful information. I don't really care about average miles per hour or elapsed time, and would have appreciated gas mileage readings (not included). The miles driven is redundant with the trip odometer on the  dash. Climate control is very nice, keeping the car either warm or cool accurately, but somewhat confusing to use. Air can be fresh or recycled or automatically determined by computer (the confusing part) if fumes are present. I still haven't quite figured out what that means. Passenger seat is 4 way power adjustable and both seats are heated ( standard on "L"), which with leather in a cold climate you really do need (they get very cold to sit on). The "mist" button on the end of the wiper stalk is a nice touch that allows one sweep of the windshield during light rain. The driver power seat will fully retract when the engine is turned off to allow easy entrance and exit, and return to the previous setting upon starting the car. There are 2 presets for the seat and mirrors available ( on "L" version this is standard). Electrochromic rearview mirror is standard (automatically adjusts for day/night electronically). 

     I probably missed some items, but the list is very long. I bought the XG300L version and most everything is standard. With moon roof, heated seats and a long list of standard items on the "L", plus every option available (wind shield for moon roof, cargo net, 8 CD changer) and pin stripping the car listed for around $27,000. I paid $23,500 with 0% financing for 5 years. For $660, I got the extended warranty for 10 year/ 100,000 mile bumper to bumper coverage ( usually 5 year/ 60,000 mile) which is then also transferable to a new owner. You cannot come close to matching that with any other car. I think it is a nice looking car (but that is subjective to each person) and the quality seems to be there so far. I am extremely impressed the fit and finish at this point. I highly recommend this car to anyone who can look beyond the prestige factor of some brand names.
