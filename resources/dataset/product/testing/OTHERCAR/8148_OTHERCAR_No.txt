            I needed a digital camera to take photos for auction sites. When I saw this camera it looked great for the price. I have to say I don't like how the delete function works. It deletes the last picture taken not the picture that you have on the LCD display. The photo quality is ok it does not take &quot;crisp&quot; pictures. If the area you are taking the picture in is low in light, you can't see a thing in the LCD display. I have found even following the directions in the manual you still get dim photos even with the flash on. The software takes a bit of time to get use to. But I do have to say for the buck its a better camera than the Jam Cam. <br><br>
