            At 7,000 miles I have no real complaints other than the obvious tires and cup holders.  No interior problems or warranty problems to date.  Fuel economy has increased to average of 29 MPG with 80% highway miles.  With the tire replacement of P195 60R14 Bridgestone Eager the handling and road grip is much improved over the Kumho tires that came with the car.  All other compact cars failed in one way or another in my search for a new compact family hauler.  This was the ONLY compact car with sufficient seat adjustments in the under $13,000 price that was comfortable, the standard feature level was a plus.  Handling is way on the sporty side versus soft ride, but it does behave well with only a little small car ride harshness. Bottom line, this is a good solid compact car worth a long test drive. 

15,000 mile update:  No problems to report other than a burnt out rear dome light.  Fuel economy now that the new winter blend has hit the gas pumps has dropped to 27MPG average.  The heater works very well, but the driver gets more heat at the floor than the passenger.  The front alloy wheels are a pain to keep clean from the brake dust.  Overall still very happy with the cars performance to date.

Getting close to 20,000 miles now:  The two front door handles chrome are flaking off, replaced no problem under warranty (but I wonder if it is going to happen again).  As I understand chrome plated plastic is not the best no matter who does it.  Yes, an annoyance, No does not change my impression of the car.  Passenger fog light went out this winter.  Dealer replaced the bulb no charge.  Car still has not had a single problem that would affect the reliability of driving it.  Dealer service screwed up and left the lights on last time it was in and battery went dead, so radio code had to be re-entered.  Overall car is still good, dealer service could be better (this dealer also services and sells Toyota and Lexus).

As a final note to this update:  If the chrome flakes off again even out of warranty I will be calling Daewoo to see about getting a full set shipped to me direct for free.  (Maybe even ones without any chrome on them at all as I think the chrome looks kind of funny since it is the only thing chrome plated inside the car)  Light bulbs burn out from use and vibration so the fog light in my mind is not really a failure of the car, but at least this first one is covered under warranty....
