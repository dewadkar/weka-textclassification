            i have two maximas. one is a 94 and the other maxima is a 00. the 94 has never had a problem; i have never had to take it to the shop. it's reliability has nothing to do with being driven on few occasions because it has 60000 mi. on it. i am even thinking of getting my second son one also. the nissan maxime is the safest and the most reliable car i know of that is on the market. no car can compair to the nissan mixima for the price. if you even are considering getting one take it for a test drive and you will fall in love with it.<br><br>
