            Ok.  I'll admit that I didn't buy my 1995 Toyota 4Runner.  I inherited it.  I understand that there have been some improvements to the later models, including a neat exterior re-styling and some additional power, but the fundamental mechanics are still the same.

When first introduced 7 years ago, the redesigned 4-Runner was best-of-breed.  It's competitors then were primarily the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  Of the three, the 4-Runner drove most like a car and didn't suffer from the mechanical problems of the Jeeps.  

Unfortunately, the 4-Runner also came with some pretty significant deficiencies:

POWER:  This thing has got to be the worst at acceleration of any non-diesel single axle vehicle out there.  I shudder with fear every time I have to merge off one of those retarded clover-leafs onto traffic moving at 75mph on Highway 101.  When I floor the accelerator, it sure makes a lot of noise, but a whole lot doesn't happen.

TOWING CAPACITY:  You'd think they designed this car to haul loads of stuff up steep mountain roads...WRONG!...When I moved to California, I towed a nearly empty, 10' U-haul trailer.  Any slight incline, and the car struggled to get past 55mph.  Combined with a steady headwind, and freaking Winnebagoes towing SUV's were flashing their headlights for me to get out of their way.

FUEL ECONOMY:  For a 3.0 liter V-6, this thing guzzles so much gas and creates so much greenhouse pollution that the temperature over my parking space has risen 1 degree since I started parking there.  I get 14mpg tops, usually around 11.

So what do I like about the 4-Runner?  It all boils down to one thing:

SIZE: I can do whatever I want and drive like a jerk on the highway and NO ONE will do anything about it.  Once upon a time, when I was driving a normal car, I would get dirty looks and fingers from people just for changing lanes without my blinker.  Now in my monster 4-Runner, I can swerve straight across four lanes, clipping the front of a station wagon with a family of 6 and NO ONE will even honk their horns.  I love it!
