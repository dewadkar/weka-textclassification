            I have to tell you, a LOT of research went into this purchase! As a consumer that gets irritated quite easily when I don't "get what I pay for", The Finepix 2600 has pulled through and come out on the top of the pile. I had purchased 4 different digital cameras in the $200.00- $250.00 price range, varying brands, and returned all before I settled with my Fuji. 
The Finepix 2600 comes packed with image editing software that is quite adequate, a USB cable, rechargeable Fuji batteries with a plug-in charger, 16MB SmartMedia memory card, handstrap and, of course, the required "for dummies" owner's manual. 
I run auctions on eBay constantly, and was in the market for a camera with excellent macro (close-up) mode, picture clarity, and an affordable price. Once again, the Finepix 2600 passed the test. The camera also has webcam functionality, which is a definite plus, and has the ability to record MPEG movies (size will depend upon the size of card upgrade you choose), however there is no sound to these recordings. An external mic would be a nice touch. The Fuji batteries included have an adequate life when charged fully, but for webcamming, the optional AC adaptor is pretty much required. I purchased a 4-pack of NIMH batteries (NOT Fuji brand), and they work quite well in the camera and charge in the supplied Fuji charger. This may void your warranty, using non-Fuji batteries, but I have never had any problems. 
There is a review function to check your pictures after they are taken, and with this feature you can actually zoom in on the shot with amazing clarity and object isolation. It is a 2.0 megapixel camera, 2.5 optical / 3x digital zoom, 1.8 inch LCD monitor, and allows for internet conferencing when used with Windows. Also compatible with Windows XP. 
After the first month, my battery compartment door latch ceased to work and I exchanged the camera for another, with no further problems. Probably just a isolated defect. 
Down to the "bare bones", the Fuji takes great pictures (really, it's the camera! I had nothing to do with it!) 

Optional accessories that I HIGHLY recommend would be : AC adaptor (VERY helpful), carrying case, more batteries, and a larger memory card (SmartMedia). If this review prompts you to try one of these out yourself, please feel free to email me and let me know what you think!
Happy Snapping,
Hank
