              Nobody will mistake this midsize Chevy for a Park Avenue, IROC or Lexus, but for $16,000 it's a bargain worth some serious thought.

  First off, you won't like the Malibu if you demand:
  -- flamboyance, glamour or a trendy nameplate
  -- a ride and steering as smooth as a Grand Marquis
  -- upholstery and dashboard as rich as a Mercedes
  -- the performance of a Trans Am
 
  But for solid and dependable transportation with a decent amount of fun thrown in, the Malibu is a good bet.

  The basic package is a four-door sedan: 3.1 engine with automatic transmission, A/C, power steering. Options include power steering, sunroof, cruise control, leather seats and a bunch of lesser bells & whistles.

  You could call the body styling 'bland' or 'traditional,' depending on your mood. I'd say it's inoffensive and likely to still look OK in 10 years -- unlike some of the trendier European and Japanese imports.  Critics bash the Chevy because it's American, but from the front or rear view the Malibu is remarkably similar to the costlier Nissan Altima.

   The interior is seriously roomy for a midsize, especially in the back. Same with the deep, wide trunk. Unfortunately, the molded-plastic interior looks like it's going to wear pretty quickly, and the factory speakers are just too tame. 

   Brakes have been criticized on earlier models; the 2001 still has a longer-than-average stopping distance. But the steering is tight and responsive, the ride is smoother than you'd expect in this price range, and -- despite what I've read in plenty of other reviews -- the 3.1 is peppy. You get strong acceleration uphill or passing, and there's a rich reserve of power if you're cruising at 60 or 70 and want to kick it up a few notches.

   The good news: That 3.1 delivers a pleasant surprise on the highway. The bad news: It's also surprisingly noisy. Several magazine reviews praised the Malibu for its silence; I can't imagine why. The is NOT a car for enjoying subtle strains of cello music on the CD player. 

   Rear visibility isn't great, but it's WAY better than you'll get on the comparable Dodge Stratus or the larger Chevy Impala. The stripped-down Malibu (similar to mine) still gives you automatic door locks and a strangely useful feature -- running lights (When I saw that feature in the brochure, I shrugged ... but it's proven to be a wonderful convenience).

   At about 7,000 miles on the odometer, my MPG is averaging 26-27 on a schedule of mostly highway miles. A minor adjustment to a radio switch was the only work done so far.
