            Sorry, I had to revise this opinion. I have used the camera for a while now and I have decided not to recommend this camera. I am sick of getting unclear pictures and missing key, split-second moments because I have to wait for the camera to focus. Most of the stuff below still applies but I am just getting too many unclear, distorted pictures to recommend this camera.

 
Here's my old review:
I bought this digital camera about four months ago. I read all the eopinions, online reviews and decided on this one. It was relatively priced for something with 2.1 mega pixels.  It had a good-sized LCD display and held 8MB worth of pictures. Nothing else on the market stood out like this one so I bought it. I also got a 64MB memory card to go along with it.  

I got it home and began using it. I took about 10 pictures of my room and then loaded the software. It was easy to install software and the pictures were downloaded with ease. They were stored in  their own directory on the desktop. They were easy to view through the software as well.

After seeing the pictures I drew two conclusions. The flash was really bright (it made everything white) and it was out of focus. It turns out that you have to hold the button half way down and wait for a green light before a picture is perfectly focused. This usually isn�t a big deal for taking stills but trying to get something quick is not fun.  When you wait for the light (1-3 seconds) you get a pretty clear shot. Of you just pointy and shoot you take your chances. 

Another thing I don�t like about it is the fact that it takes about 5 seconds to turn on. There is a five second delay to turn on the LCD also. Plus you can�t view the pictures without closing the front slide plate.

It doesn�t come with a case. It doesn�t come with a plug. It does use the USB port which I like. 

Overall I would rate this camera average. I don�t have a lot of experience with different kinds of cameras, but for $300 I expected something a little better.
