            I chose the A50 because it was from a proven camera manufacturer, and because of its feature/price combination.  Canon is very good at making lenses, and since the lense is the most important part of the camera, it seemed to make sense to go with them instead of a film or computer company's product.

The A50 is a marvel when it comes to ease of use.  You just point it, focus, and click to capture the shot.  The complex part is how your pictures come out.  Luckily, most digital cameras offer a screen where you can immediately tell if you've just taken a bad shot, and you can quickly have a 2nd try.  But even with this second chance, you shouldn't have to wonder if you took a good shot so much.

The number one issue with the quality of the pictures that the A50 takes is lighting. The flash is not very powerful at all, and because of this, it only illuminates about 8 feet in front of you.  If your subject is more than 8 feet away from you and you have something in the frame that is closer, it will soak up all of the flash's energy and appear very washed out, while your subject is dimmed beyond recognition in the background. If you're outdoors, or are in a room with great lighting, you'll get amazing photos.

MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY!  This is a must.  You'll spend far less money and worry when you invest in this much needed addon.  Also, since the camera comes with an 8mb CF card, you'll probably want to get another one at least.  Then comes the USB CF card reader for your computer.  (Whew!  You thought you were just buying a camera!?)

With the proper use, you can take great pictures with it.  I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it to those of you who are looking for a good first digital camera.  I plan on sticking with the Canon line for my next one!
