            I'd recommend this car to anyone.  Good price, Great gas mileage, very stylish.  I bought it in January 2001 and just love it.  Gas mileage is about 23 mpg (automatic trans).

A lot of people comment about how good it looks.  As the bag boy at the grocery store exclaimed as we walked up to it, "It just smells like a fast car!".

It rides very low to the ground but I haven't had any 'bottoming out' problems.  I got the car fully loaded and I am glad I did.  The sunroof appears to be larger than most other cars.  With the sunroof open, it's just the perfect amount of air circulating through the car..you hardly even know the sunroof is open.  I also got the all-weather package that includes (among other things) a rear windshield wiper and fog lamps.  The rear windshield wiper has been great!

The only problem I have noticed is a very large blind spot on both sides.  If you sit in the car, you'll understand.  I just make sure I am aware of where the other cars around me are and depend quite a bit on my side mirrors now.
