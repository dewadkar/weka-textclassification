            The Sony DSC-P20 was my second digital camera, I've used it for six months. The Camera itself is relatively small, not too small and not oversized like low-end Kodak or HP models. At first glance, the camera looks to be another great quality product from Sony. After you use it and look at the picture quality it's a different story. Here are the Details:

THE SPECS:
-------------
The DSC-P20 is a 1.3 Megapixel Camera. It takes pictures at 1280x960 maximum resoultion. It also has 512x384, 640x480, and 1024x768 resolutions. The features include a count-down timer, red-eye reudction, integrated flash, 1.5" color LCD screen, and viewfinder. The DSC-P20 uses Sony's popular Memory Stick format, which currently sells from 2MB to 128MB sticks. The camera is made of durable plastic, and uses a USB connection to link to the PC. The Camera also uses 2 AA batteries or the optional Sony NPFS11 InfoLithium ION batteries (Not Included). If you decide to use regular AA batteries the Battery life is only 20 - 30 minutes total or about 12 shots with the Flash! some people have reported even less!, I was using 2 AA NiMH 1800mAH batteries and they lasted about 1 hour total. Using the NPFS11 Lithium Ion will last you 2.5 hours. The DSC-P20 comes with 3X Digital Zoom and no Optical Zoom. I found the images to be slightly degraded when I used the Zoom up to 3X but its hardly noticiable. The camera also comes with different picture effects such as Black&White, Solarize, Sepia, and Negative modes. The camera saves images as: TIFF, JPEG, or GIF. It also takes MPEG movies (no sound) at 320x240 or 160x120. The camera also has a "MACRO" feature which will sharpen and focus in on images that are 3 feet or closer. The Sony DSC-P20 is loaded with features.

THE PACKAGE:
---------------
There are not many accessories that are included with the DSC-P20. Included in the box are: 2 Sony AA batteries (wont last you very long), Camera Wrist Strap (The most useful item included in the box), and a 4MB Sony Memory Stick (Only lets you store 6 - 10 JPEG Full size shots at full resolution). Also included are the manuals and Software/Drivers CD-ROM, and USB Transfer cable. I suggest that you either go purchase some good 1800mAH NiMH rechargable batteries because Alkaline batteries will not last very long! This camera has extremly low battery life!. Or If you are rich, you can buy the NPFS11 InfoLithium Battery for $89.99 CAD or $60.00 USD. Also you might also want to get a 32MB or higher Memory Stick. I had a 64MB Memory Stick which stored 118 JPEGS shots at full quality and higest resolution. or 36 TIFF uncompressed shots, or 11 minutes of MPEG Video. The package does not include a Camera bag, which I recommend if you want to carry the camera around often. Also Not included is the Optional AC-Adapter for the Camera. Optional Accessory Packages like the Sony ACCCSPW for DSC-P20, DSC-P30, and DSC-P50, includes the NPFS11 battery pack, Carrying Case and AC Adapter Charger. The Accessory Package is around $75.00 USD or $145.00 CAD.

THE PROS IN DETAIL:
---------------------
The Sony DSC-P20 is relatively cheap compared to other Sony Digital Cameras. You can probably get it for even cheaper than $200US since it is a 2001 model. Also This camera acts as a Memory Stick Drive! This is an excellent feature. You can transfer any kind of files to and from your memory stick like a removable hard drive. Also this camera is very easy to use. I didnt even need to read the manual and I figured out all the features etc.

THE CONS IN DETAIL:
---------------------
The biggest Con about this camera is the picture quality. The picture quality is not as good as it should be, and it is absolutely horrible in low light conditions. The pictures are usually fine in outdoor light, however indoor light may have undesirable results such as: slight discoloration, and sometimes grainy pixels. In low light conditions the camera is especially bad, because the integrated flash is relatively weak. Also the red-eye reduction will not work properly sometimes. The DSC-P20's LCD Screen scratches quite easily, and needs a camera bag if you are likely to get it scratched. Another major CON is obviously the battery life using standard AA batteries. This camera has the worst battery life I have ever seen. I used up the 2 AA batteries that were included in the box in 15minutes! I was only testing all the features and playing with the camera when I got a low battery warning!

Do I still own this Camera?   NO!

If you want a Sony Digital Camera I would suggest a newer more mid level Sony Camera. It'll be more expensive but it will be worth it.

If you want a excellent quality low cost Digital Camera, check out the Canon A30 or A40 both are loaded with features and excellent picture quality. See my review on the Canon A30 (The camera I'm using now)
