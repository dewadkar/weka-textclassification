            We own the Chevy Truck 1999, 3 door with the Z71 off road package. The truck has the 327 engine in it - it is fast, very fast. It is also equipped with 4WD Automatic.

Handling: We live in snowy New England. This truck handles only OK in the snow, even with 4WD or AWD drive on. This was a little disappointing

Dry pavement: handles very good. Be careful, there is a lot of power under the hood.

Few wind problems that have been taken care of when we first bought it - nothing major. (loose back window)

Towing: excellent job. We tow a camper and it does the job very well.

The seat are not very comfortable and do not accommodate my 6'2&quot; husband very well. (Should have bought the 60/40 split? maybe? The vehicle has bucket seats. This vehicle is not comfortable for an 8 hour ride.

The back seat has lots of room. I've been told the most room of any truck my friends have seen.

I would recommend it to anyone.
