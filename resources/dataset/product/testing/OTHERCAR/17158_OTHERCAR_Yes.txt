            I'm a petite young woman (5' 2", 110 lbs), and I love my SLK 230 Kompressor.  The car is, honestly, temporary for me, until I get married and start having a family.  What can I say, I needed more "pizazz" with what I drive.  (I used to drive a Honda Accord sedan before this!  I got bored with that way too quick.)

PROS:
The car is definitely a cinch to wash & wax; it's so tiny!  It's extremely manuverable & absolutely wonderful on the road.  I live in California, and with all the "ancy" and poor drivers out on the freeways, having a car that can maneuver well like this one, was a plus.  Also, I get compliments left and right, by kids, professional adults, even aged men and women who tell me that I have their "dream car."  (It really is a dream car!)

SOME SPECS:
With the following specs, it sure gives me more than enough vroom-vroom on the road:

Horsepower: 185 bhp @ 5300 rpm, Torque: 200 lb-ft @ 2500 rpm, Redline:  5800 rpm.

Okay, the 185 bhp may not seem like a high number, right?  But remember, this car weighs in at a mere 2992 lbs.  

BLING-BLING:
It's also enough bling-bling for me, because I do like nice things.  But of course it's a big ticket item, so don't go splurging on it unless you can afford to.  Just changing the oil costs $115 at the dealership! (but I go to a separate European-cars mechanic anyway)

DESIGN-CHICK'S CAR?:
I also feel that this may be more of a "chick's" car, just because I have NO idea how any full grown man (or woman, for that matter!) can fit into this thing and be the least bit comfortable!  

It's got a great sleek design, though, and a very classy and sophisticated look, but if I were a guy (since guys are mostly into car performance over looks?) I would probably choose the BMW M3 convertible instead.  Or of course, a Boxster, if I had the money.  ;)  

COMPARED TO OTHER CONVERTIBLES:
Of course, what got me oogling over the SLK was the fact that it is a convertible hard top, and all at the simple touch of a button!  Talk about amazing!  And yet, most people till this very day, still do not know that ALL SLKs are convertibles!  Mercedes did such a great job w/ the mechanics of this car, that I can only imagine how wonderful the new models are, not to mention the SL model.(although my '98 SLK does have a little bit of wind/road noise, but definitely not as much as a soft top convertible!). 

Also, a huge plus about the SLK is that the rear window that folds into the trunk, is an actual WINDOW, not like those other convertibles that have those flimsy cheapy plastic rear windows, that turn almost-yellowish as the years wear on.  yuck!

Lexus came out with their version of the hard-top convertible recently also, but I still think that the SLK is a lot more appealing, without that "Hi, I'm retired and I just turned 60!" feeling, like the Lexus.  ;)  Just kidding.  All I'm saying is that the SLK model has a more "fun" look and feel to it, without being over-aged and stuffy. 

CONS:
My boyfriend (5' 10", 185 lbs) does hate squeezing into this tiny car, especially for a long drive.  I admit, there's hardly any space for this 2-seater.  But the trunk can hold two medium sized suitcases and other little extras, just fine.

I would not suggest getting this car if you're used to driving around other people, or if family/friends visit often from out of town often (and you play chaffeur for them).  Also, this probably would not be a good car for you if you are a full-sized adult (over 175 lbs, or over 5' 10"), or are somewhat claustraphobic.

LAST COMMENT:
I just have one last comment.  I LOVE MY SLK!
