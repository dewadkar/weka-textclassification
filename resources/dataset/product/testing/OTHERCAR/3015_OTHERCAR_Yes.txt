            I have a 1994 &quot;Chevy&quot; Metro.  Although it is only my second car I have ever owned, it is a really nice car.  It was economically priced, and the gas milege is unbelievable.  Currently it is 5 yrs old, and has 42,000 miles on it.  Additionally, I get 34 miles to the gallon.   This is the perfect vehicle for a single person, or married folk without kids.  It's downfall is that with back passengers, the car doesn't ride as &quot;fast&quot;.  But being it's just me, we (the metro and I) can drive like we own the road.  Other downfalls for this later model Metro would be no power anything (locks, windows, steering)  But I would recommend this car.  I haven't had any major problems, and maintain it very well.
