            We had to buy another car after our Saturn was in an accident. We only had minimal money to spend(2800 dollars) and started shopping around. I didn't even know all that much about Mercury cars. So, when a car dealer was going to give us a great deal on this car we jumped on it. 

There were high miles 170,000 on it. But absolutely nothing wrong with it. We have had it for 1 1/2 years and are still in love with it. 

We have the XR-7, and it is fully loaded. Keyless entry, power everything, luggage rack(even though I really am not a big fan of it, it takes away from the sportiness of it!) We have 3 children in car seats and the seats fit perfectly in the back and plenty of leg room up front. The trunk is also extremely large also. 

We have the 302 V-8 engine and boy is it FAST!!! After owning our Saturn we really wanted something with a little pep and boy did we get it. We get about 18 mpg highway miles. Not all that great but for that size engine it is still pretty good.

The one problem we have had is the price it takes to fix this car. My husband bottomed out and tore up the power steering pump, and it costs us over 600 dollars to get it fixed. And it took a long time just to find someone who would fix it. We ended up having to take it to the dealer. Which are basically the only people who will work on it. Parts are very hard to find for this car also. We have had to have the dealer order parts for us for my husband to do the basic fix ups. Another thing that is hard to work on with this cougar is the spark plugs. You will probably have to get a mechanic do that because it is pretty snug around there.

The cougar now has over 200,000 miles on it with no signs of slowing down. I don't think that we will ever get rid of this car. I could see this thing lasting way longer than 500,000 miles.
