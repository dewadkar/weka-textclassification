            I have had my Del Sol, a 93 for a year now.  It is an SI model with the SOHC VTEC engine.  It has the matching floor mats and removable targa top that makes it a cute sports car.  I love this car.  I have owned 3 Hondas to date and find them to be the easiest cars to work on because of the simplicity of the design.

This Del Sol has been through snow storms and come out without a scratch and as long as I take care of it, the Del Sol handles like the first time every time.  Granted it has had some problems with a &quot;squeaky&quot; targa top from time to time but all in all it has been a faithful companion.

My wife and I love to sit in the car and watch sunsets on Lake Erie and go for endless drives on hot summer days.  We have put about 60,000 miles on it in the year that we have had it.  It just got its 90,000 mile update and the technician said we should be able to get about 400,000 miles out of her if we take care of it.  

The Del Sol gets oil changes at Honda every 3,000 miles which is sometimes more than once a month for us.  It has a new hood because of a little hail damage earlier this year but other than that the car is completely stock.

I have found that Pirelli Tires don't work very well because they seem to pop all the time.  Currently we are with Dunlop tires and they seem to be working just fine.  

I bought this vehicle for the fun of it and others who just want one person with them should consider the car for its practicality and great gas mileage.  (Mine gets about 35 mile to the gallon.)  If you are a family oriented person, however this little two seater is not for you.<br><br>
