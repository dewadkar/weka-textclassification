            I have been following the Odyssey threads for some time. I finally decided to buy one. I called a regional dealer who informed me that they had a 50 person waiting list PER COLOR, and that it would take 6-10 weeks for it to come in - but they welcomed my $500 deposit. So I went to my local Honda dealer, who had 3 VINs coming in - one of which wasn't sold. It was in white, which was one of the three colors I would accept. So I bought it sight unseen, never driven an Odyssey. We paid MSRP, but they added the remote alarm, floormats, and mud flaps.

I got my EX (without NAV) 8 days later. I had owned a 1998 Toyota Sienna for 18 months. The difference between the two is startling. The Odyssey is far and away the better minivan, to me. The Sienna is a wonderful van: it gave me no trouble, and excellent mileage (around 20 in town). Here are the reasons I prefer the Odyssey.

1. The Odyssey is roomier, especially in the trunk. It is just large enough to make it perfect for my toddler and 6 month old than the Sienna.
2. It has an amazingly short turning radius. Even though the van is longer and wider, it is much easier to parallel park and just plan turn around.
3. The Odyssey is quieter at all times than the Sienna ever was; around town, and at 70 MPH. I do have the Michelin tires.
4. The Odyssey handling and ride is really well thought out. The ride is much more controlled; My Sienna dipped in the turns. I feel safer driving the Odyssey. Despite the larger size, the Odyssey is a much easier car to drive than the Sienna. It holds the road better under all conditions I have encountered. I like the drivability of this van better than any car I have ever owned.
5. The magic 3rd row seat. The rear seat will fold so as to face backwards (while parked) I have found this perfect for changing diapers in the rain. The rear hatch swings up and provides protection from the elements, and the backwards seat is the perfect height to change the little ones (and comfy too).
6. The stereo controls on the steering wheel.
7. The electric doors. The Sienna doors are difficult to close from the inside.
8. The second row Captains chairs in the Odyssey have height adjustable seat belts.
9. The Odyssey is lower and easier to get into, but has a higher ground clearance than the Sienna (must be magic).
10. The fit and finish is slightly better than the Sienna.

Things the Sienna is better at:

1. The Sienna seats are more comfortable, IF you prefer a softer ride. The Odyssey seats are set to complement the stiffer suspension. I like the Odyssey combination, but many would prefer the softer handling and ride. This is not a defect in the Odyssey; Honda designed it to be the way it is.
2. The Sienna has much more convenient cup holders for the first two rows of seats.
3. The Sienna has more convenient cubby holes to store miscellaneous stuff.
4. The controls are more convenient on the Sienna (12 volt outlets, stereo positioning, etc.)
5. The plastic in the Sienna is padded; the Odyssey is hard plastic.
6. The seat belt connectors in the second row captain's chairs are more convenient in the Sienna. The Odyssey puts the connector about 4 inches in from the edge of the seat.
8. The dealer installed alarm on the Sienna is better. In fact, just about any alarm is better. The Odyssey factory alarm will not automatically lock the doors when the key is turned on, or unlock the doors when the key is turned off (my Sienna did both). Also, the Odyssey alarm does not automatically set; if you forget to set the alarm, it will not be set. Also, there is no &quot;chirp&quot; when the alarm sets or un-sets. 
9. Toyota actually provides cross bars for their roof rack.
10. The key fobs for the Honda cost $81, and replacement keys cost $80. The Sienna keys were cheap to duplicate.

Here is one piece of information on the Odyssey that is not posted anywhere I could find on the internet:

The Odyssey has a maximum weight capacity of 1277 lbs. For some reason this number is not listed in the Honda specifications, but it is buried in the owner's manual. The Sienna has over 1300 lbs capacity (around 1350, as I recall). This number represents the maximum weight the vehicle can carry, including passengers, cargo, and towing hitch weight.

Which minivan is better? I feel that the Honda is the better built machine, and I like the handling. However, many would prefer the softer handling of the Sienna, and it is smaller in size - yet I find it more difficult to handle than the Odyssey. So drive them both and decide which is better for you. Even better, rent each for a week and decide.

Hope this helps for those of you still shopping.<br><br>
