            I purchased a 1999 Pontiac Bonneville after examining several cars in the same category.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the vehicle.  My wife and I test drove the Dodge Intrepid and the Buick Century.  Of all the cars considered and the three test driven the Bonneville was the most comfortable to include head and leg room (I am over 6 feet tall) and had the most power.  I have driven this car about 3000 miles since I bought it and I love the way it handles.  I have set the cruise control at ninety miles per hour on the freeway and felt perfectly comfortable with the ride.  If there is one disadvantage tot he Bonneville it would be the trunk space.  While the trunk is by no means small, it was not near as large as the Intrepid.  The smaller trunk was compensated however, by the 3.8 liter engine rather than the 2.7 liter in the Intrepid.  My recommendation to someone looking for an affordable yet luxurious sedan:  buy a Bonneville!<br><br>
