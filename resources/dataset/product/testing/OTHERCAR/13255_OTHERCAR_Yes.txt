            This is my second Honda Accord Ex, and I will never, ever, go back to an American car.  I will continue to buy Honda, as will my family.  My son is a convert, owning 2 Civics.  The car is dependable enough for a single woman, runs forever, and looks great even after 10 years and 1000K miles!

I traded a '91 Honda Accord Ex for a new one, even though I did not have to.  The trade in value was great, blue book or dealer, and it looked brand new after detailing.  I wanted a change, did not want to start having to worry about replacements, and the only problems I ever had in all those years was getting a stone stuck in the wheel casing, and a rusted out muffler pipe after many horrific Wisconsin winters.  I got it replaced at the local Fleet Farm for a very reasonable price. 

Since I wanted a new color and altered body style, I traded in for a '99 Ex, and it is a beauty.  The color, best described as eggplant, receives many a second glance.  The interior is user friendly, with expanded trunk space and the addition of a trunk protector for transporting plants and mulch, as I do. 

Maintenance costs are minimal as well.  With normal wear and tear, your Honda should be good for a couple hundred thousand miles!!!<br><br>
