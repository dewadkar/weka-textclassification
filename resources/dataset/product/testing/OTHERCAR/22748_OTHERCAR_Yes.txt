            After having the Chevy 3500 diesel, the Ram seems like a significant improvement. The styling is certainly the best on the road. The diesel engine is infinitely more reliable than the Chevy and the stability with a solid front axle is far better than the alternatives. Dodge still has a real problem with its quality control. On day one the CD player did not play--had to be sent back to the manufacturer. The paint has no apparent clear, protective seal since it scratches even with plastic tubs. When I purchased the truck, I asked about the history of transmission problems. The salesman assured me that this had long been corrected. Guess what! Nine months after purchase, the transmission began to fail! Another service call. At 25,000 miles I had to spend $1,000 to replace all four brake discs and shoes and one master cylinder. After about 14 months, the electric mirror, on the passenger side, came apart from the inside-almost $400 dollars to replace. The fuel gauge/fuel module also failed at the same time--about $519 to replace! Bottom line? I think the Dodge Ram is the best American made truck available, but it is built for looks and only somewhat light duty work. I would worry about any continuous heavy duty work, although I have to admit that it pulls and hauls a tremendous weight load without any hesitation. <br><br>
