            What seemed like a good deal on a new car back in 1997 turned out to be a nearly two year nightmare when I purchased a Dodge Neon coupe. Its cute appearance and low price attracted me, but the love soon wore off. 

<b>The Good</b>
It was a nice looking car...though the newness of the design had worn off by the time I purchased my 1997 model, it still managed to turn a few heads.  Interior room was another plus...the backseat of the Neon, unlike many other coupes, would actually fit two adults comfortably. The engine delivered admirable power, and cornering ability was excellent.  Though I didn't own the &quot;Sport&quot; model, the Neon could feel sporty when I needed it to.

<b>The Bad</b> 
The thick rear roof pillars created a terrible blind spot.  The state trooper I ran off the road trying to merge into traffic failed to take this design flaw as an excuse.  The front seats lacked lumbar support--making them terribly uncomfortable for long trips.  The seats on &quot;Sport&quot; models feature sturdier side bolsters and more lower back support, and by themselves would make the Sport package worth the price.  

<b>And the Ugly</b>
The single worst complaint I have with the Neon is that it began falling apart almost from day one. <i>Trips to the Shop Outside of Regular Maintenance:</i>
<b>9,000 miles:</b> the tape player stops ejecting...leaving the entire stereo system non-functional.  White Chrysler of Oak Hill, WV, corrects the problem by replacing the unit after a three week wait on the part to come in.
<b>14,000 miles:</b> Driving down a steep hill, a back seat passenger is met with a deluge of water.  Inspection reveals that the well in the trunk is completely flooded. Sabraton Chrysler of Morgantown, WV, repairs the leak that week, attributed to a broken body seam.  Months pass waiting for new trunk carpeting, tire jack, and spare cover to arrive.  The good folks at Sabraton Chrysler finally issue a &quot;Vehicle Off Road&quot; order and the part arrives next day air from the Chrysler warehouse.  After three months, the leaking trunk is finally taken care of...or so I thought....
<b>17,000 miles:</b> A &quot;fast blink&quot; indicates that a taillight is out.  After buying a replacement bulb at the local auto parts shop, I open the trunk and realize that the lights have <b>melted</b>--the result of a short caused by, you guessed it, water damage.  Again, Sabraton Chrysler comes to the rescue...replacing the taillamps in one afternoon.
<b>20,000 miles:</b> Wind noise around the frameless doors becomes unbearable as the seals around the windows fall out.  
<b>21,000 miles:</b> The tape player gives me a repeat performance of it's earlier failure.  The car goes back to White Chrysler, where parts are supposedly ordered.  Nearly two months pass when a call to Chrysler reveals that the dealership has <i>never</i> ordered the parts.  Chrysler Customer Care offers their apologies and overnights the door seals and stereo to White for next day installation.  Finally, at 24,000 miles, everything worked! 

The day after I picked the car up from it's final repair visit, I sold it for high book value to a Dodge fan. After less than two years and 24,000 miles, the car had depreciated nearly five thousand dollars! Buyers looking to spend $12-16,000 on their next car would do well to pass up the Neon and look for a well-maintained used model.<br><br>
