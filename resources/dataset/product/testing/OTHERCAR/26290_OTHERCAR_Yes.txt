            I've spent 8 months looking for the car of my dreams (that I could afford).  Finally it came to me, a little green subcompact car that when I first saw it starred me in the face and said hop in and I'll take you for a spin, and man o man did it ever.  There's nothing not to like.  For little goodies it's got premium audio, sun roof/moon roof, CD player, cruise control, 5 speed manual transmission, and a hunger for corners.  It always comes with helpful things such as anti-lock brakes(be careful Anti-lock brakes are NOT I repeat NOT a standard Feature in the EX coupe I don't know why), tilt steering, Key less entry, and a little 4 cylinders power house that puts out 127 horse power and gets 32 miles to the gallon in the city and 36 mpg on the highway (although I've seen upwards of 36/37 mpg driving around in my town) I bought this car used with 37k miles on it for $10,995. A STEAL!! the good thing about Honda's is they keep there value much better than American cars.  So if you sell it down the road you know you're going to get some good cash for it.  My mother has started to like my car (she steals it any chance she gets) and wants to find one of her own only to find out that car dealerships are only going to give her $11,000 for her 2002 Ford Crown Victoria Luxury edition with all the goodies and only 20K miles! (which I've also reviewed).  
     Everything in the car is designed to perfection.  Heating and A/C controls are controled by a couple of buttons and 3 simple and very helpful dials. The dashboard is well placed and very easy to read at night with bright white lights. A Tachometer, Speedometer, Engine temp and Fuel Gauge make up the dashboard along with some other warning lights.  there's also a small light on the dashboard that warns you when you are nearing 7,500 miles since your last tune up at what not.  One thing that I've always noticed going from my mothers crown victoria to my car is visibility.  The civic has amazing visibility! There is rarely a moment where I can't see what I need to. Next is the radio.  I have to say from an Audiophile's point of view these speakers aren't bad for stock.  They're no 12 speaker Bose system that comes with Lexuses but they are very crisp with some nice bang from the subwoofers.  The EX comes with 2 tweeters and 4 other mid range/subwoofers that can easily be upgraded.  the CD player itself is also very good.  It plays cds without a hitch especially some of my older ones that look like they've made their way through a sand storm (another fault that the crown victoria has. A very sensative cd player).  The radio gets good reception with the antenna up.  Also the volume stops before you get to the point where you start getting some nasty feedback and crackling however, this does not mean they don't get loud you can still crank them pretty high.  All the radio buttons are laid out neatly a little small but nothing too tiny that you'll have trouble getting used to it.  
      Just because this is a subcompact car doesn't mean it doesn't have any room.  As a matter of fact it's just the opposite.  For it's size there's huge amount of room.  4 adults can sit comfortably in it and you can squeeze 3 kids in the back.  The trunk has plenty of room but if you ever need more the back seats fold down to give you even more room.  Lifting the floor mat in the trunk reveals the spare tire and car jack.
      Enough about what the car has now about how it drives.  the 127 VTEC engine that comes with the EX and responsive and fun.  When you introduce your foot to the gas pedal there's a sweet rev and your off! the engine gives off and nice purr but not so loud that it gets annoying.  One problem however is cabin noise.  Coming from a Huge sedan like the Crown Victoria I was used to a pretty quiet ride.  On normal roads you don't notice it too much unless your hit some odd pavement. Once you hit the highway though it sets in. It is pretty loud but if you really want to get ride of it just crank the radio or CD player.  If it's one thing this car loves to do its to take corners.  This car eats 'em up like candy.  You can zip in and come flying out and not feel it.  Due to Honda's famous suspension.  The gear box is short, fun, and easy.  It glide in and out of gears even if the clutch isn't in completely(a move I'm famous for).  All in all this is an economy car that acts like a sports car
      Last paragraph I swear.  This car is bottom line the greatest and there's one for everyone! any financial situation or personality type and they're all fun to drive!  They'll never let you down.  My friend has around 169k miles on his 1994 Honda civic DX and it still purrs like a kitten.

4,000 miles later:
       2 months and 4,000 miles later I couldn't resist but to write about this car some more.  Words cannot describe how awesome this car has been!  It has put up with the harsh New England weather.  It takes snow as if it were pavement.  I didn't get stuck in snow once this year and was able to drive out of a 3 ft snow drift.  I am very strict about servicing my car.  I brought my car to get an oil change and right when he popped the hood he was surprised at even thought this car is relatively young (with 41,123 miles on it) it looked as though it had just been driven off the showcase.  I also changed my spark plugs myself which couldn't be a more easy task.  I had to go to my friends house to borrow a torque wrench and he commented on how easy the engine looked if anyone wanted to do work on it themselves(my friend is kind of a gearhead me on the other hand I'll stick to spark plugs, air filters and fluids). I recently brough my car in to get a whole check up.  When I went to pick it up the guy said I don't know why you wasted your money on this check up.  This car is practically new!
      In the past 2 months this car has gotten it's fair share of tests.  Since my sister moved out of the house I got put in charge of doing the grocery shopping(A job that I could have done without but hey it's a chance to take a drive).  My mum said that I could take the Crown Victoria for the grocery shopping but what fun is that?!  So I choose to use the civic.  It's a bit of a squeeze but I still manage to fit 100 bucks worth of groceries in the trunk.  Another test that my car has to live through is other passengers.  I don't usually drive with anyone else in the car but for the times that I do you can tell.  With one other person in the car the change isn't dramatic, but if all the seats are full you can definately tell.  once I had 5 of my friends squeeze into the car and although it seemed like the bumper was going to start grinding on the ground, the car still moved and not too slow either but it's not something I wouldn't recommend to do often.
      Although this car does handle well in the snow it is definately a summer time car.  It's now May here in New England and the weather is finally starting to get warm and sunny.  there's nothing better than cruising around in this car with the windows and moonroof open.
      Ok here's the down low.  I know there's someone out there thinking that this car couldn't measure up to everything I'm saying so I tried to come up with some cons about this car. 
Con #1: This car doesn't get the greatest radio reception however if you pull the antenna out all the way you can usually keep a signal.
Con #2: These cars are kind of expensive in comparison with other cars and the warranty isn't that great either.  However, the money paid for these cars is well worth it and the car runs so well you won't need a good warranty.
Con #3: I heard the automatic transmissions still weren't all that great however the manual transmission will last you longer than the car will
Con #4: Everyone will want to drive it
Con #5: The biggest con of all! Now I don't do a HUGE amount of highway driving but every once in a while I'll go to Best Buy or Newberry comics, both of which entail a drive on the highway. Now some people it's the noise, other don't like how small the car feels, but for me it's the very high RPM's the car goes through in the process of driving on the highway.  A long story short when I hit 60 mph the Tac reads 2,500 RPM's (the level at which I like to shift) once I hit 70 mph the engine is putting out 3,000 RPM's (This is the level at which the drivers manual suggests to shift) and the RPM's only further increase.  Now I know this is a little obsessive but I often wish that I had just one extra gear so the engine would not be running so high for so long.  The thought of the stress being put on the engine for that length of period often keeps me from driving any far distances on the highway (I do not know if the same high RPM's apply to the automatic civic but I am very interested to find out).  However, you do have to consider where I'm coming from and how much I like to baby my car.  One of my friends insists that shifting at any point below 4,000 RPM's is much too low but to each their own! 
     Ok thats the best I can do.  I really can't come up with anything else wrong with this car. Everyone who sees it realizes even though this is a economical subcompact commuter car it really does a great job of being a sporty car too.  This car is the best and I would highly HIGHLY! recommend it to anyone looking for a small fun car.
