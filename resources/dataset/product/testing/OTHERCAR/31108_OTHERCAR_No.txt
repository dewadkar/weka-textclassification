            I have no major complaints about the drive-train and external styling of my 97 Cherokee Sport, but the Jeep exec who signed off on the interior should have been fired years ago.  The back seat, as most owners know, is practically an afterthought, and the flip-and-fold-forward design is a cargo-space killer.  The front seats began squeaking within 500 miles and by 20,000 miles I'd gone through 3 radio/CD players and 3 sets of dashboard gauges (especially irksome in the case of the fuel gauge, which was eventually recalled by Jeep).  Jeep is also known for its cheap brakes, costly to replace if done correctly.  The heater isn't half what my Toyota's was, the wiper blades and washer are continually obstructed by ice or snow, and the glove compartment barely holds the owner's manual.  Friends who also own this model have their door panels or dashboard vinyl peeling after only 18 months.  My #1 beef?  The driver's-side floormat, which despite any number of creative tackings, tapings, and trimmings, absolutely refuses to quit rolling up under the pedals.  Jeep also boasts improved soundproofing in the newer Cherokees, but this improvement is far better on the driver's side (the passenger gets virtually the same dull roar).  Though they seem to be getting better, such 5-door essentials as power locks and power windows as add-on options are incredibly chintzy and unattractive.  With mass popularity, Jeep has clearly sold out its quality.  The vehicle has practically self-destructed at the end of its 36,000 mile warranty and the service departments in my area (Maryland) are among the surliest and ineffectual I've ever seen (every owner complaint was noted as &quot;checks fine&quot; by the mechanics until the warranty expired, then the $$$ began stacking up).<br><br>
