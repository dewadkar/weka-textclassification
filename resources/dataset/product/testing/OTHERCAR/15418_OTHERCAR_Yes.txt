            I own the Troy Lee Edition Version of the B3000. At first i was very skeptical about the truck. I have always been "Go american" type of guy. Mazda proved me wrong. What's nice about the Troy Lee edition is the interior. Carbon Fiber trim is seen throughout it giving it a nice visual aspect. Seats are very comfortable and have a long travel range to accomdate and size person. Even the two jump seats in the cab are comfortable (granted not for long periods of time). When i first got the truck people would make fun that 1 it wasn't full-size and two it wasn't 4WD. Let me talk about it not being 4WD. After hearing numerous comments i set out to test to see how well this thing handles off-road. IMPRESSED..that's all i can say. This truck (with the right driver) can hang with and do most of the same thing 4wd truck can. Not once did i get stuck or bottom out (there's a good 10 plus inches of clearance). The 3L 140hp V6 can make this truck get up and go if need be, however, torque isn't the greatest. There have been a few times where i have had to down shift to go up a small hill (now i know this is common in trucks but this seems to common). My only "major" complaint on the truck is that when shifting gears, after you press the clutch in the engine revs higher a few hundered rpms before going back down. I think only a slight adjustment is needed to fix this (have yet to take it in to be looked at). Only other real problem i have had with the truck is rough starting after only sitting a day. Engine sounds like it has laringitis or something, almost gasping for air. After a few minutes it clears up and runs fine from there on out. My overall impression of this truck is a 4 out of a 5. I was happy to see that most of this truck is made by Ford and in the US. I've seen many trucks like mine on the road and the people i have talked to say they love there truck. Now the 21k i paid was Hawaii price with a "adjusted retail value" added on. However i feel that the price is just a tad high. Put if your looking for a mid-size 2wd truck and look to have some light off-road fun with it (i have) then this is definitly the truck to have. I hope this info has helped.
