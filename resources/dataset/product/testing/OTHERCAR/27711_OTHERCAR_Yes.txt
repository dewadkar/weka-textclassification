            The Eclipse Spyder was the third convertible I have owned and the most fun of all three.

With rocket-fast acceleration and great styling, the Eclipse is just an all around great car.

I have about 57k miles on my Spyder and have had relatively few problems. The top has proven to be somewhat troublesome, but most repairs were covered under warranty.

Overall, if you are looking for fun in the sun and a great two seat car (the back seat is a package shelf), the Eclipse Spyder is for you!<br><br>
