            It's Big, all white, and has a nickle-plated spotlight on the drivers' side. The partially covered real wheel wells are all that set apart this car from the later Caprice.

This review might have almost nothing to do with the "Caprice Classic", because the police-optioned car is a different beast. Starting at the ground, the tires are Goodyear GT 4 235/70R15 V speed rated (149 MPH) on steel wheels that weight about twice as much as regular steel wheels (see "The Blues Brothers" movie for example of abuse applied to police tires and wheels). Suspension and anti-sway bars on the front and back make for a firm and flat ride. Brakes are appropriate for a 2 ton car: heavy rear drums and large vented front disks with semi-metallic pads that squeak around town but stop hard from 80mph. Steering is not the sloppy "one-finger" power of grandpa's Cadillac, but it is power assisted. Steering is precise at all speeds.

The seats are comfortable, cloth front buckets and vinyl rear bench. Visibility is good, except for where the spot light and handle is. Ease of entry and exit is A  in front and A from the back seats. My Grandparents appreciate this.
Headroom and legroom are large and fine. Carpet is thick black vinyl mat that is very sturdy. Six-foot-three is not too tall for a driver. He would adjust the tilt wheel and seat. There is no cruise control.

My only complaint is the speedometer. In bright afternoon sun over my left shoulder, I can's see the digital speedometer unless I shade it with my hand, but the tachometer is a 5 inch diameter analog gauge that is super in all conditions. I guess that cops don't care about mph, only rpm. 

The drivetrain is where the Chevy gearheads drool over this car. 3.42:1 positraction rear axle, special balanced driveshaft, 4L60 4-speed Overdrive Automatic Transmission (afaik, same as later 700-R4 trans) with WOT upshifts, L05 350 cubic inch Throttle-Body Fuel Injected, roller-cam, V-8 (rated at 205hp@4200rpm / 300ft/lbs @ 2400rpm) with neat features like wide-open-throttle air conditioner cut out. The alternator is a 124A Delco-Remy, the battery is Group 78. From experience, there is considerable power above 4200 rpm.

This car likes to keep cool with an aux oil cooler in front of the radiator, a power steering fluid cooler, and a heavy-duty radiator.

The standard car with a 3.08 rear axle is capable of towing 5000 pounds (22 foot Airstream trailer), but the 3.42 axle gives the  car pulling ability up to 7000 pounds. The problem is that a 7K 4K lb trailer-car combination would be unbalanced, so 3.42 gears will pull up to 5K with more hill-climbing power than the other gear sets.

The doors on this car have manual windows and power locks. The trunk is electrically opened or with a key. The body is rust-free, due to Washington County maintenance, or unsalted roads, or GM rust-proofing?

Since nothing is a free ride, what's the penalty for such a hard-pulling, quick, large car? Fuel economy. This combination gets significantly fewer miles out of a 23 gallon tank than the more mild drivetrains, even in perfect tune, with premium fuel, and 144K miles. Chevrolet says EPA 14/20 and my experience is exactly that with 500 pounds of junk in the back seat and trunk. If the car had the 305ci V-8 and 3.08 or 2.56 gears, it would get EPA 17/26 and not accelerate so well.

The later Caprice 9C1 cars with the LT-1 engine accelerate a little faster and get a little better fuel economy. Port Fuel injection requires 8 injectors vs. TBI with 2 injectors where a carb would be. 1996 cars have OBD-II smog controls with greatly increased complexity.

I had to change the catalytic converter to pass the Air Quality test last year. $375 part, ouch. No change in how the car seems to run: always well.

Compared to the recent pack of 5000  lb Sport Utility Luxury Vehicles, 14 mpg city is pretty great. The Caprice also has none of the tendancy to to roll over and crush the occupants that the high center-of-gravity SUV's have. For a real horrorshow, check out the Frontline program "Rollover".

I'm glad that I learned to drive in tragically underpowered cars like the 1979 Toyota Corolla 1200cc, and 1980 Toyota Celica 20R, because it taught me cautious defensive driving. I learned about driving cars that only save gas and are rolling coffins. I learned to wait and watch.

This car has a combination of acceleration/ braking/ maneuverability that would be extremely dangerous to an inexperienced (young) driver pushing the limits. Those limits are above 130mph and beyond the headlights of Ford Crown Victoria "police imposter" pursuit vehicles.

Highly recommended for drivers with self-control, restraint, and a sense of humor about the reaction of other drivers. A really safe car to drive on the open roads of the American west.
