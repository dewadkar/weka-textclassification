            When I got my license I was given an old minivan which I sold at the end of the school year.  During the summer I went everywhere looking for a car or truck.  A week before football started I was in despair, still no car.  On the way to the city my dad stopped at Denny's Body shop, a friend of his, to look at his always excellent selection.  I passed the Bonneville because all I had was $1000.  But my dad went strait to it.  It was a beautiful dark green with tan interior, aluminum wheels, spoiler, bucket seats, remote entry, and an added CD player.  

I was thinking mom would enjoy this but she loves her car, maybe I�ll get hers.  When I asked my dad of this he said, "Mom's got a car, this is for you."  

Stunned was the only way I could describe it.  It was the same body style as the new ones and was only 7 years old.  It had 198000 miles and not one ding or dent. Plus it was from California and had not one spot of rust

But it missed slightly and the brights wouldn't turn on.  My dad took it to the city, did our errands, came back and bought it. We changed the spark plugs and wires and gave it a complete oil change.

I was expecting to sell this car in about 2 or 3 months and make a small profit to go towards another car.  But the first time I drove it I was in amazement.  It handled like a dream.  This car would zip along back roads like you would not believe.  It had special road gripping tires that really worked, except in the snow where they almost killed me.  (Firestones FX40�s I think) The interior was laden with creature comforts like power seat, mirrors, windows, locks, cruise, you name it.  I wasn�t selling this yet.  I was in hooked. My favorite things were 

--The remote lock/unlock which unlocked the doors and opened the trunk from a distance
--The handy double visors which blocked sun in front and on the sides.
--Twighlight Sentential which is when it becomes dark enough the headlights turn on for you, then turn                off after a certain amount of time when you shut off the car.  It can be up to 3 minutes. 
--15 inch aluminum wheels
-- spoiler which really adds to the look of the car
--Pass through in back seat.  You�ll use it much more than you think you would, plus doubles as an armrest
--True bucket seats and full console with floor shifter. (only the 1992-1993 it is easy to get buckets in the SE version)  A true 5 seater.

The car had a 3.8 liter V6 with 198000 miles when I bought it.  I never lost one drop of oil through that engine , nor did it ever stop with it�s excellent gas mileage.  An amazing 28 to 32 miles per gallon.  In a full size car.  This is not an approximate, 28 city 32 highway.   You get a lower miles per gallon with the supercharged engine.  I do not recommend it.  Fuel economy goes down by about 8 miles and insurance triples.  All you get is a faster car.  It is quick enough with out it.

I drove this car for 10000 miles over the next year and I had my fair share of problems.  The owner before me had tore parts of the electrical system apart, trying to fix small things and ended up causing more problems for me.  Some one had stripped the gears of the power antenna so it got bent and such from being up all the time.  The after market CD player had never been hooked up correctly.

So as you were driving you could tap the floor in certain spots and interior lights would flicker or turn on and off.  And if you bumped a rubber band I had set up, you couldn�t get any radio reception.

The only breakdown I ever had was about after 7000 miles (I live in the country so it was after about 5 months) The wire harness in the engine had been messed with and the fuel regulator went.  The car wouldn�t start.  It took my dads friend, who was a mechanic, 2 months to figure out what was wrong.  He needed a diagnostics machine but didn�t have a new enough one.  So after all that head ache they finally got it running but poorly.  I tried limping it 30 miles to a repair shop.  It quit once then made it.  

Two days later I got a call from the shop.  He said �Who tried to fix this car?�  I told him and he told me that if it had been towed there in the first place it would have been at the most a week.  And it also was about $300.  That is kind of an expensive breakdown, but this is to be expected on an older car.

Other than this a had a battery and an alternator go, but the alternator was original!

And after all that loyal service how do I repay that car.   On one of it�s first trips out in the snow ever (first winter in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan) a deer runs at my side.  This has happened countless other times during other parts of the year and I know how to drive in the snow.  But those Firestone tires which so hungrily grabbed the road in the summer, threw me in to a spin. There wasn�t hardly any ice either! I ended up in a 3-foot ditch, facing the opposite direction, side smashed into the trees.  I got out and accessed the damage.  A small dent over the gas tank cover and a shattered drivers side fender. (Fiberglass)

It took me a half an hour but finally I got out of the ditch.  When I got home I noticed that the gas tank had more dents then you could count but never did leak.  I also lost a fog light and scratched the hell out of the front bumper.

Although the price for professional repair was about $2000 (Which I fixed most of myself for about $200) I decided after $10000 miles it was best time to sell her and find something else.  I got $1800 dollars for her.  A young woman bought it from me and I could see from the look on her face that she fell instantly in love with it.  

I still see it from time to time in the city.  It drives my friend nuts when I point out a car that was once mine, there are quite a few.  It�s nice to see it after these few years.  Maybe I�ll look up the car when the young woman is through with it and give it the proper care and restoration it deserves.
