            Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one.

My main complaint about this camera is that it is too bulky. In fact, it was so bulky and heavy that I ended up selling it to a friend and going with the Canon s400 instead.  For me, the real power in a point and shoot camera is size and convenience. The more convenient it is to lug, the more you will have it with you to capture life's precious moments.  And the s50 should most certainly be considered a point and shoot camera because it's manual controls are strange to operate and I eventually found myself not wanting to bother with them because of the way they are implemented on this camera.

For instance,  being able to shoot at a wide aperture on the s50 is of limited usefulness because the zoom lens doesn't maintain the wide aperture when you zoom in even just a little. So during the times I used my s50 and wanted a shallow depth of field, ie. when i was doing portraits, the f-stop automatically changed itself from f2.8 to f4.0 or f5.0 when I zoomed in to frame the shot.  I thought to myself, I  might as well have been shooting with the smaller and more convenient s400! Also, you might be tempted to think that flash exposure compensation is a godsend, like I initially did. But in practice, dialing down the flash on this camera yields dingy looking images in lower light. I was dissappointed.  

Also, the image quality was cetainly acceptable and I have no complaint there, however the image processing time and shutter lag was definitely noticeable, especially indoors in mid to low light levels. 

The s50 is just too big to carry around everywhere and subsequently, I did miss taking certain photos because the camera was back in the car or at home. I does not fit well in a shirt pants pocket and it weighs down a jacket pocket. When I wanted to slip it into my my film camera bag, it took up too much space and was unwieldy. My recommendation if you must have manual controls in a digital camera is to either step up to the Canon G3 or equivalent, or go to a digital SLR.  Otherwise, for a carry-around-everywhere camera, the smaller Canon ELPH series would be best.

I never really used the tiny viewfinder and don't recommend that you do either. Why? It's very tiny and not convenient, and it only shows a portion of the image frame. Also, it does not show any information such as shutter speed or f-stop. You are much better of using the LCD screen and doing so will give you a "what you see is what you get" image on the camera.
