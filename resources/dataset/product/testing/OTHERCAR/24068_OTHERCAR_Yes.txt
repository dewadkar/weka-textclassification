             Being a professional actor and also a semi-pro photographer, I was blown away last March when I did a commercial for Sony Digital. What fascinated me was the fact that the director shot the entire commercial himself using a hand held digital camera. After shooting each sequence he was then able to review what he had just shot!

 After that I decided I must try a digital camera. Being a retiree on limited budget I decided to go for a cheapie camera ( I bought an Agfa 2000 for 97.00.) The camera came with  software,a cable for the computer and very basic instructions, I thought that I would learn about digital photography,and then if I wished step up to a better high priced camera.

That is exactly what happened. I now know a pixel from a pickle, an image from an icon and memory from mammary.The Argus performed well but I had a problem with the enclosed software instructions.Specificly, how to retrieve images I had saved.Now the good news! I purchased a Canon printer, and included in their software was &quot;Canon Photo&quot;.

 This program now enables me to file and RETRIEVE my photos. It also allows me to crop, change size, artistically alter or exercise many other options. So, now I still plan to upgrade my camera ,but the Canon program made it so much easier to live with my Argus. The bottom line is, its O.K. to start small, learn the basics and then go where you are happiest.<br><br>
