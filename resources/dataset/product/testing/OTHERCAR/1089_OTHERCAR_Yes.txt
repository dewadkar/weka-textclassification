            After a couple of years abroad, and the last in Poland, I've grown accustomed to small cars - not small like the average American thinks of small car, but cars which I'm convinced can be powered by your choice of gasoline, emaciated hamster, or seltzer bottle. These are cars that are small enough to fit into their own glove compartments. These are cars light enough to be equally convenient to carry as to ride in. Part of the culture shock in coming back stateside was the sheer size of the cars people are driving. That was made even more profound when I read that statistically 51% of new vehicles on the road are SUVs. 

Well, I'm still dealing with the culture shock. I also had to deal with getting a new car. It is simply not feasible to go job hunting in southern California without a vehicle. What I wanted was reliable and basic transportation. I needed it to be inexpensive to buy, to insure and to operate. I also wanted a small car. 

I started doing my research on the internet at Epinions in the compact car section. I didn't know much about Kia, but I liked the reviews I was reading. I went to their web page (www.kia.com) and did a bit more research. I still had to go get my driver's license (After a couple of years abroad, mine had expired.)

What I found was that it was possible to get this car from too basic even for me to quite dressed up. The base model car comes with: a 1.5 litre, 16 valve, 4 cylinder engine with a maximum of 96 hp at 5800 rpm. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. Disc brakes are standard. Four-wheel disc brakes are not available, but anti-lock brakes are an option.   (I got an automatic because my mother will sometimes borrow my car and she can't drive stick.)  

On the inside there were nice features, too. There is a center armrest for the driver which is nice for long rides. There are 4 cup holders. Because my mother has some issues with mobility and I will be driving her, I was especially glad to see that passenger assist grips were standard. These overhead handle make it much easier for mom with her arthritic legs to get in and out. Whatever color you opt for on the outside, the inside is going to have a grey cloth interior. The car also includes standard children's safety locks. My favorite feature, however, is my 8-way adjustable driver's seat. I can tip the front edge of the seat lower or higher; I can do the same with the back edge of the seat. The back support can change the angle at which it meets the seat cushion. The back also has an adjustable lumbar support built in. Of course, the seat also slips forwards and back. The steering wheel is adjustable. So is the height of the shoulder strap. What all this adjustability means is that I can be comfortable driving this car. I'm 5'4". My friend Michael took the car for a test ride. He's 6'1". He thought it was comfortable, too. (Though he still prefers his SUV; yes, he's one of the 51%.) 


Finally, driver's license in hand, I went to check out the Kia. I was pleasantly surprised. (Up until now, the car had only been a picture the size of a Matchbox auto; I wanted small but that was too small. Though the Kia is a compact, it doesn't feel compressed. 

The test drive I took included mostly flat areas, but also a pretty good grade as I climbed over a couple of hills. I was driving an automatic, and it seemed to change gears a bit slower than I might have with a manual, but overall it did very well. I've been driving this car now for a few weeks and I'm continually more impressed with how it handles. 

Most of the trips I've made have been going around town. It does very well in stop and go traffic. Driving in parking lots, the speed bumps are far less jostling than I would expect for a car this size. Also impressive, to me, is how smooth this car is both starting and stopping. 

I've taken the car on two longer trips on the highway of about 200 miles each round trip. The gas mileage was close to the advertised 30 mpg. I got about 29 mpg. The car is not quite as comfortable for long trips as it is for short, but that has more to do with no car being as comfortable for 2 hours or more at a stretch.

I got the most basic radio/CD and air conditioning as my only options. This car, therefore, has manual windows and no automatic door locks. (The neighbor's kids think my rolldown windows are very cool. They've never seen windows that didn't work with buttons before.)

When it came time to buy, the final choice was between the Saturn SL, the Toyato Echo and the Kia Rio. I liked the way the Kia handled better than the Echo. I Saturn was a stiff competitor, but the Kia was less expensive by about $2000 and had a better warranty. When it came to insurance, the Saturn SL was the least expensive to insure, but the difference was less than $30 a year. 

When everything was said and done, I got the car off the lot for $11,704 including tax, title, delivery and all the other things they charge you for besides car. My deal included a $1500 rebate for paying cash (the other option was a 0% for 48 month loan.) The car comes with a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty on the power train; 5 years/60,000 mile limited basic warranty; 5 year/100,000 perforation warranty (against body rust/perforation); and 5 years of  roadside assistance. The dealer I went to (Garden Grove Kia - on Garden Grove Blvd between Brookhurst and Gilbert) also included lifetime free oil changes. 

I ended up getting a gold Kia. I don't see many cars this color on the road, and I really like that. Everyone tells me it's a cute car. I didn't get it for that reason, but it sure is nice to hear. I love my new car. It drives well. It's easy to park. It's comfortable. The only one who has complained about space was my friend Michael when I put him in the back seat. He said something to his significant other that doesn't bare repeating. The result was that his S.O., sitting in front, scooted the seat back into Michael's legs. Other than that one occasion, he was comfortable in the back seat, too. He also commented that he liked the fact that the car was a four-door. I like that, too. I hate feeling trapped in a back seat, and I'd like my passengers to be able to get in and out more easily.

If you're looking for a good little car, I can recommend the Kia Rio. I love mine.
