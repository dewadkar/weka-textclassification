            I absolutely love the 1996 Chrysler LHS.  When it was new, it cost near $32,000.  It has a V6, two-wheel drive, and leather seats.  I love the leather seats.  It is such a comfortable ride, and the leather seats make it even better.  It has ample leg room, for the front and back.  The back seat is  long, and can fit up to three people, with room left.  The back seat also has a fold down armrest in the middle.  My son often lays in the back and goes to sleep while I drive.  That should tell you how comfortable it is.  It has one of the smoothest rides for a car that I have ridden in.  I have had little trouble with the car since 96.  There is really nothing that I don't like about this car.  I think anyone who has the money should buy this car, because it will fit up to five people, a nice size family, in the car.  It also has a CD player, something that my previous car did not have.  I do believe that the 1996 Chrysler LHS is a quality car for anyone.<br><br>
