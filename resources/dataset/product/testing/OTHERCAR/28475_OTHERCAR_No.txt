            I was so excited, Volvo was to introduce a new pocket rocket! given my love for anything Volvo and Turbo, the V40 had promise.

I checked out the Volvo web site, made a test drive appointment, and prepared myself for the impending purchase.

I anxiously waited as the dealer salesman got the demo tag and plopped it on my dark blue metallic demo.

Vroom Vroom, I revved the engine. SO it sounded like a ford escort, so what? right!

Whine Whine, so it wound up like a ford escort, so what? right?

Roll Roll, so it cornered like a ford escort, uh, so  what, I guess, right?

Wrong.  It was not a Volvo. Not in power, not in trim, not in comfort, not in handleing.

This is a turbo charged ford escort. Save your money.
