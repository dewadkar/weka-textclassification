            (updated 6/21 with a few more car details)

When I started shopping for a car to replace my '92 Integra hatchback, space, reliability and price were my primary requirements. I test drove cars all over the map - 

* Passat (my other front runner rejected due to the boring style); 
* Mazda Protege 5 (love the style but wanted something higher end. Seems like a great car for the price); 
* PT Cruiser (wasn't ready to trust the reliability; otherwise the stick version I drove was pretty fun);
* Rav 4 (didn't like the storage space and felt small. Comes bare bones and once you add options like a storage cover - as if everyone doesn't want that - it adds up); 
* Acura RSX (only because I loved my Integra. It was way too small for me though and only fits 4 people max);
* Toyota Matrix (thought I might get tired of the style and didn't like my test drive experience although their MPG made it tempting). As you can see I didn't really want to go the SUV route.
* Subaru WRX Wagon - All my guy friends were jealous I'd test driven this car. It was fun but as I wanted a sunroof and leather - both of which are not advised in this car, I had to say no.

I picked the 2002 Subaru Outback LTD wagon for several reasons: reliability, according to friends and strangers I spoke to who had this car; sporty style; nice and spacious interior; and reasonable price for the class. Oddly enough the dual moonroofs were another factor tipping me toward the Outback from the Passat. It just seemed so cool!! (Note: the front one only tilts up while the rear retracts all the way.)

I bought the car through CarsDirect which was a pretty simple process. I'd settled on the Limited model as it conveniently is shipped with a roof rack, leather, Heated Front Bucket Seats, and other options that make it a little swankier than the base model. 

The basic specs are:
* Engine: 2.5L 4Cyl. SOHC SMPI, 4-cylinder engine with 2.5-liter displacement, single overhead cam valvetrain, sequential multi-port injection STD
* 5-Speed Manual w/Overdrive
* Tires: 225/60R1697H Bridgestone RWL Radial M&S AS
Heavy Duty tires with Outlined White Lettering, 225mm width, 16.0" rim
* WL-02 Wheels: 16 in. x 6.5 in. JJ Aluminum Alloy
* AM/FM/Weather Band Stereo w/Cassette/CD
(see Subaru.com or carsdirect.com for current details)

CarsDirect immediately found a local dealer who had my Wintergreen color car in stock, including the optional 6-Disc In-Dash CD Changer with Subwoofer/Amplifier (about $575 and worth every penny). The price was about $1000 lower than I could get through a dealer myself.

Currently I have 5000 miles on the car. 

<b>WHAT I LOVE:</b>
* The storage space is fabulous.
* The leather and wood design feels very high end. All of my friends admire that the car has more of a European style.
* My optional sound system has high end stereo system quality, to my ears anyway, no matter if I'm playing classical, hip hop, or rock full blast. 
* Definitely feels safe to drive in inclement weather.
* Seatbelt closures in back seats tuck into the actual backseat so you don't end up sitting on them for example if a kid is sleeping in the backseat. 
* Car seat heaters switch between a seatback heater or seat heater, and warm up quickly as does the car heater (note I am in California so under extreme cold I'm not sure how well they will do). A lot of water drips from the front right, like a puddle, even when I'm just using the vent set on cold, which the dealer says is normal.
* The backseat is very spacious, as confirmed by a recent 6'1 passenger.

<b>WHAT I DISLIKE:</b>
* Pickup - I think it's well documented that the Outback could use a little more kick when starting off in 1st gear. I often think if this were driven by real horse-power I would be cracking the whip! I am not sure how the V6 would compare.

* Subaru advertises 27 miles on the highway. When I had 2000 miles on the car, I drove 350 miles only stopping once and got 25 mpg, which has been my max ever. This is a huge disappointment and would have affected my purchase decision. (If you own this car and have had the same experience I am interested to know.) On the other hand, they advertise 21 in the city yet I seem to consistently get 24 (I guess averaging my city + highway commute).

* I have to have headlights on in addition to day lights in order for the radio to be lit up enough to read the digital readout.

* I am 5'3 and can't wear boots while driving as the top of the boot gets caught on the lower part of the dashboard when shifting. This is a big disappointment as I have driven sticks my whole life and never encountered this.

* The clutch and brake are extremely close together. Sometimes my feet hit each other. A friend who drives a BMW Z3 sports car noticed the same thing. 

* Perhaps this is the case with most midsize cars today but I find it almost impossible to make a full U-y in an intersection without having to do a Y turn. (In my previous car I was able to swing a U-y no problem.) 

<b>Extras:</b>
I learned by chance in reading my manual that Subaru includes a plan where they will tow your car to the nearest Subaru dealer if something happens. This is a great benefit I didn't know about.

<b>Problems in my first 2000 miles:</b> I have not owned a brand new car for a while and so perhaps these issues are par for the course but I thought I would mention them.

1. Alignment was off - I realized I was holding my steering wheel to the left and when I let it go on the freeway I would soon be several lanes over. I had to go to the dealer a couple of times before they realized my particular car needed to be aligned in a way that is overcompensated to the left, over factory specs, in order to drive straight. 
2. Windows made loud squeak - Upon bringing the car in I was told they had put together the window too tightly so the dealer took the door apart and put it together.

In all these cases the dealer was very responsive and pleasant. Subaru customer service has been responsive as well.

In sum if you have requirements similar to mine I recommend you try out both manual and automatic versions of this car. If you can lease it first to see how you like it, that could be a good way to go.
