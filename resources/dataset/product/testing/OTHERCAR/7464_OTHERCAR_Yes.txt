            I have a 2000 Grand Am.  I love it.  However, it does have some set-backs.  I am a medium build person and don't feel like I have enough room behind the wheel, and the safety belt chokes me, too.  But I feel very safe in this car, already had a minor bump in a parking lot, no damage to either car.  My kids love it, they find it easy to buckle-up and are proud to be in this car.  I do love the wide view that this car offers.  It took a couple days to get used to it, but the blind spot we are used to is not there anymore.  Very wide windows and I really like that.  I have a 4 cylinder, and I get great mileage, I travel about 45 miles a day and average about $14.00 a week for gas.  Wish gas prices were a little lower, but still I feel that amount is very good.  At first I thought I had a big back-end to my car and found it hard to park or reverse, but it didn't take long to figure out that my car was smaller than it appeared and parking is now a breeze.  I haven't had a new car for about 12 years, this was definately a new challenge for me.  But I really love my new car.  It is very beautiful, metalic grey, 4-door, cloth interior.  I would recommend this car to people looking for a family car.  By the way, it has a mid-size trunk, so long time travel needs a luggage rack, but still really ok.  Week trips without extra's would be efficient.  Love my new car, give it a chance!  Love Susan<br><br>
