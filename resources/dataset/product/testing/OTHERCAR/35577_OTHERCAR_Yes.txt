            I purchased a black, five-speed, Civic Ex Coupe (with a spoiler, of course!) in June 2001.  I bought it because I like the way it looked, and I love the reputation of Hondas.  I have since fallen in love with it's responsiveness and style, as well as the great gas mileage!

I'm not writing this review to tell you the torque or the horsepower, to tell you the dimensions, or to tell you what type of suspension the 2001 Civic has.  I want to tell you that it is a quick, tight, sporty, stylish, inexpensive car that will last years and years with good care.  

I love the fact that I get 35-37 mpg in the city.  On my last road trip to my parents, I was getting 40 mpg on the interstate!  I only need oil changes every 10,000 miles according to the manual (just wait, I'll probably still do it 1,000 miles late!).  

I also love the layout inside the car.  My old '87 Honda Civic that I had in high-school had similar driver controls, however Honda has imitated Nissan's layout somewhat, and improved their interior so that everything is orderly, intuitive, and easy to reach.

The 60-40 split of the fold-down back seats makes hauling camping equipment and passengers a breeze.  Little coordination or finesse is required to fold down or fold up (I'm grateful for that, since I lack both!).

Anyways, I don't really have anything bad to say about my car (except that it's not paid off yet).  I'm really thrilled with it, and I don't feel that I could have made a better purchasing decision.
