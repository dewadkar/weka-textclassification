            I really enjoyed this camera it is small enough to put in a coat pocket . Its packed with a lot of features that I liked .. Like the Optical Zoom.  Bright Large display on the back to review your pictures after taking and the zoom lever was placed in a good place. I also loved that it has a display on the top of the camera so that you don't have to use the picture display to learn about how many pictures are left. If the flash is on and what setting it is on. I only used one flash setting and really couldn't get into detail about what the others did but I know in some settings the flash worked slower and some it flashed quicker. The battery life is poor with the picture display on but without to be honest it wasn't that bad and all i ever used with the camera was regular batteries. After every picture I was able to look and then I just turned off the display. Which there is a little button right on the back to allow you to do that very easily. So if you like to use the review screen just get RECHARGEABLE batteries. You can set this camera to take different quality type pictures like high quality took a lot of kb and you could only take about 20-32 on a 32mb card but I could take like 200 pictures of the low quality pictures with a 32 mb pictures and you can picture that the medium quality picture would be somewhere like 100. I used low quality on ebay and the pictures where crisp and had great details for a 1.3 megapixel camera. The camera also had a timer which came in handy.. Zoom worked like a dream I believe it's 3x optical and 2x digital. I used the digital zoom once and I really didn't care to use it again. I had to go into menu of the camera to get to the digital zoom and it didn't really do anything more than a picture editing program would do for you.. However the optical zoom was excellent I could have used a little more range on it but it worked pretty good for what I used it for which as ebay, personal and vacation photos. The smart media is really cheap so that won't be a problem. The only real complaint I had about this camera is that pop up flash sometimes on my camera it wouldn't work right and I was really afraid that thing was going to mess up from the beginning, I just dont personally like having to deal with pushing that thing up all time it seems fragile. So all in all I would say go buy one of these on ebay because its a good camera you will enjoy and it won't be as expensive as some of the other 1.3 camera out now.
