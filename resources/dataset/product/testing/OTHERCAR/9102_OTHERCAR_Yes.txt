            With being on a budget and recently married the Kia fit in my budget.
I'm happy with the dependability, safety features, and handling. When I drove a 4 door car I couldn't parallel park, but with being higher in the air, and good handling I can get in a spot on the first try. It's a heavy vehicle and I have had no worry of it tipping over. I've driven other 4x4 and did not trust it's pulling power; however, the kia can drive me in to a pasture in the middle of winter and get me out again. Also note the extra air bag on the driver side for the knees if in an accident.
Two draw backs; the closest dealer from me is 100 mile away, and in the year I've owned it it has had two recalls. The interior is not as nice as the jimmy or blazer but that is petty for what all you do get. 
Yet it is perfect for someone just starting out or on a tight budget. <br><br>
