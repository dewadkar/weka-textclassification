            I purchased a 1985 Nissan Maxima for $4200 in 1993 while living in Texas. The car had about 90,000 miles on it, which was good for an 8 year old car. The Nissan 3000 series V-6 engine is a very good powerplant, capable of 0 to 60 in about 8 to 10 seconds. The interior seats four comfortably, and part of the rear seat folds down to allow additional storage space for longer items that you may place in the trunk. The stereo/cassette player is decent, and the sunroof/moonroof does not leak. This car was an instant Japanese classic, inheriting its looks and sports car heritage from the early Datsuns. Gas mileage is also good, averaging around 17 to 18 MPG. The resale value on these cars is also above average, you can probably buy or sell one of these for around $3000.00, and with all of the aftermarket goodies available, this car is a perfect choice for a second car. That is if you could afford the cost of replacing some of the electronics on it, which have a life span of about 10 years. The mass airflow sensor alone costs about $300 to replace. Some of the other electrical sensors and relays also add up. Diagnosing any engine problems is best left up to the dealership or someone with a mechanics computer system. Nissan has had a mass recall on these cars to replace the fuel injectors for free, but by appointment only. The rack and pinion and CV joints are also somewhat expensive to replace.
