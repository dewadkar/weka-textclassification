            The 1996 Honda Accord has a few noticeable differences from its 94-95 siblings.  Chrome accents have been added, the tail lights have become more conservative, and the wheels have gotten bigger on the LX (15&quot;).  With that said, this is still your basic family sedan.

The Accord consistently receives high marks each year, and this model is no exception.  It is arguably the most dependable car for under $20k.  I own a '96 LX sedan, and it now has 128,000 miles.  Yeah, that's a lot.  But my previous Accord lasted way beyond that, so I expect to see this baby all the way into the 200-300k.

What does it have?  Dual airbags, ski hole in the back seat, great engine, power everything, and a high build quality -- something I can't really explain.. stuff like all the moldings snap on tight and seem to be secure.  Oh, and dual-stage locks.. one of those quirks you find after owning it for years (explanation: use the key to unlock driver's door, but if you hold it for 2 seconds, it unlocks all doors).

What does it lack?  Well, I have a few grievances with my Accord.  Firstly, I think this generation (5th) and the previous generation have faulty glove box locks.  The light inside will turn on sometimes when I go over a bump at night, which I blame on the sensor not lining up correctly.  The other complaint is the transmission, which Honda fixed in the 98+ models.  It gives a little kick before changing gears.  The wind noise (tire noise) is tolerable; I wouldn't say it is quiet, but it won't annoy you either.  And being a Honda, the torque is lacking -- even though the Accord is better than a Civic in this department.

To sum things up, this is your standard Honda.  All the controls are where you would think them to be, reliable beyond all hopes, good gas mileage, lots of extras, and a reasonable price tag.  I would recommend this car for a teenager's first car or for someone who doesn't want to worry about maintenance problems.  It'll get you from point A to B with a good bit of comfort, and you don't have to worry about it dying on you.<br><br>
