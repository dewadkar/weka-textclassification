            I bought a Jetta GL new and have put about 60,000 miles on it.  On the whole a pretty reliable car, though I have had a few problems with it. 

1.  Moonroof. While still under warranty I had to have the moonroof replaced and it's never been the same--the noise level is irritating at high speeds.  Believe it or not, the thing refused to close as I was entering a car wash--perhaps it was fate.

2.  Exhaust.  The original muffler lasted less than a year but the real issue was the header pipe. Right after the warranty (2 year/24,000 mile) had expired (of course) I found out that the header pipe was cracked, which is a $1000+ job.  Because this is an exceedingly rare condition I was able to find a used one, which made it a $800 repair.  Still pretty painful.

Other than that, a pretty fine car.  Handles well, but as the title suggests it's extremely slow (and I even have manual transmission). 

One final note:  I have the VW car rack with two bike holders--it works very well but creates ALOT of noise if you have a moonroof, and basically renders the moonroof as useless...
