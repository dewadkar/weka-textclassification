            I purchased a 99 2WD LS 8 mnths ago and am very pleased.  I bought this SUV b/c it seemed to have the most options and features at the lowest price, had the most &quot;car-like&quot; handling, 3 yr/ 50K warranty, 205hp engine, a good reputation, and b/c of the ease of working w/ the Isuzu sales team.  Buying this vehicle was very low stress.  LS package came w/ V6, roof rack, PW, PL, AC, cargo cover, cargo mat, floor mats, cruise control, intermit. wipers, cassette/6 spkr stereo. Many of these features cost extra on other SUV's.  The only feature I had added were the 15&quot; alloy wheels which were a reasonable $400, total price came to $19,900 plus T/T/L; the dealer arranged a private contractor to tint the windows for another $150 which included lifetime warranty.  

I would recommend this vehicle to others who feel they need add'l space, but don't want to feel like they're driving a truck or to those who want a new SUV but are on a budget.  The Rodeo also provides ample passenger room in the rear seats, while maintaining cargo capacity in the far rear.  I love being up high when driving, it gives a better view of the road and a feeling of security.  I also love the freedom and convenience of the space this SUV provides.  I put two dogs in the back, and a canoe on top, while still being able to carry 4-5 adults and have a stylish vehicle that I can take to work or out to dinner.  Even going to the grocery store is easier; just throw all your stuff in the back and no bending over to get it out later; very, very good if you have a bad back.
I have not found anything I &quot;hate&quot; about this vehicle.

I would not recommend this vehicle or any SUV to others who are especially focussed on gas mileage, they all get lousy mileage.  My Rodeo seems to range between 22 and 16 mpg depending on conditions.  I would also caution others to gauge the amount of space they need carefully, the Rodeo has plenty of storage, but don't think your going to be hauling 4X8's in the back, I still have to borrow a friend's P/U truck to get lumber.

Criticisms include: 1) It takes two steps to open the rear- open the rear window, then open the side opening rear door, a single step would be more convenient as would a door that opened upward instead of to the side (this however is very livable); 2)  There is fabric where I place my elbow when driving, although it is not wearing out, it has made a somewhat permanent depression; for those like myself who like to drive w/ the window down and arm on the door, it could become a spot that wears prematurely; 3)  To get foglights and 16&quot; wheels req'd getting the top of the line model (LSE) which also included leather seats, which I did not want.  However, the price for the upgrade was reasonable.<br><br>
