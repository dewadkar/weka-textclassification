            To set the stage for this, this opinion is based on a rental of a sportage a couple of weeks ago.  I'm writing it because it surprised me so favorably I figured others might also be similarly surprised.  The first surprise was how sturdy it felt.  I took one look at it and figured ok, this is going to tip or pull a lot in the curves and if we're going too fast we'll just tip right over if we swerve.  Boy was I ever wrong!
This little guy was extremely solid despite its high profile.  In fact, it felt significantly less likely to turn over than heavier SUVs like the Range Rover and Land Rover (which felt like they were ready to flip at 25 mph in a turn).  And since I wasn't doing all the driving I can also say that I didn't think it was going to tip over even though the driver took the curve at, oh, maybe TWICE what I thought the appropriate speed was.  That was the first pleasant surprise.

The second nice surprise was the legroom in the back seat.  I've got long legs -- I drive with my Saab seat ALL the way back and typically find seats too close to the pedals. So sitting in the back seat seemed like it would be a smush.  Another surprise!  While my knees did touch the back of the driver's seat, it wasn't bad at all!  I'd say if you wanted to put adults in the back seat, figure two not three for a long trip, though because the vehicle isn't that wide.

The cargo area was also relatively large -- another surprise since it looks pretty tiny in the picture.  The spare was external on the one we rented, so that may have helped some, but we had luggage for three and barely covered the floor.

It's also very driveable, and the version we had (not 4X4) did very well even with slushy roads (picture about 3&quot; of slush all over the lane).  

Another pleasant surprise was the quality of the stereo system.  Keep in mind this was a rental, so you know that they didn't pick the top of the line system.  But it had excellent sound -- as good as my Bose speakers at home.  (We played the CD, not the tape player.)  It also didn't have a very loud ride -- especially for such an inexpensive car.

Reclining the passenger seat was tough.<br><br>
