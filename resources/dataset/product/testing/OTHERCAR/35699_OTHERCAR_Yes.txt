            This truck is great. I guess I don't really know how good it is on gas, because I do not keep track of that. But I will say I drive over 600 miles a week , I will update the review on what I actually think of the gas/ mileage.
 Anyway this vehicle I bought used for 1,500 , it wasn't in bad shape really at all.. A few rust spots / holes around the wheel  but , they are patched up now.
  This truck is really built to last I had a leak in the heating core but that sealed to..( hmm this is starting to seem like a bad review.. but, it is not) Might I add the mileage on it is at 301,240 yeah 3 hundred thousand!! whooooaa!!!!!
  It runs great  my water pump went bad but that  happens to all vehicles at a point , so thats no biggie.
  It really got power I have not used the 4 wheel drive yet.
Personally I think it is worth buying if you get a chance pick it up
 Thjis is a bang for your buck.
