            I purchased my new KIA (47 miles) in April, 1998.  At 1400 miles, I had the FIRST brake job i.e., rotors, pads.  By 20,000 miles, the brakes/rotors had been replaced an additional 6 more times. By 20,000 miles, the following had occurred:

The suspension bars were repaired at the same time I received the first brake/rotor repair at 1400 miles. The heater-defroster failed the first winter during a heavy snow storm and was towed 45 miles to the nearest KIA Service Center. All the door locks have been replaced and/or worked on more than once. The trunk leaked so badly from underneath, that in the winter items froze to the trunk carpeting or mildewed in the summer. The cover over the trunk and spare tire area finally had to be replaced, due to the mold and mildew that had formed from the leaks. There have been 4 (failed) attempts to correct this problem - so far. (It still leaks). Even the lock on the trunk has been worked on for a leak.  A KIA service technician once told me that, &quot;all car trunks leak to some extent&quot;.  

The windshield wipers malfunctioned one month before the recall was issued by KIA for this defect. Once during a storm, the windshield wipers stopped and the headlights were stuck on high beam. The car was towed once again.

There was a recall on the fuel pump and just recently another re-call for bolts on the fuel pump from the previous re-call.

The glove compartment latch jammed (after the third opening) and had to be replaced.  A defective panel underneath the steering column was also replaced. Also, the driver's seat covering was replaced as it was &quot;shredding&quot;. 

There is a happy ending to this saga.  The Bank in the Chicago area (who financed my car) will no longer finance these vehicles. But, the very best part is - it didn't cost me one thin dime to sue KIA !!! THE LEMON LAW WORKS. This process took approximately one year before a settlement offer was received by KIA; and, would have gone on much, much longer if depositions were taken and a court date had been set. KIA insisted it would not &quot;buy back&quot; the vehicle; but, instead agreed to pay several thousand dollars and extend the warranty an additional year to - 4 years/48,000 miles. 

KIA was pretty smart in waiting to offer a 10 year/100,000 warranty until now. (This warranty should be retroactive for all KIA's, or at least, have a &quot;grandfather&quot; clause attached somewhere to this generous deal). I believe KIA wasn't too worried about the Y2K scare - its Y2K problems occurred in 1998!

For now, I'll just sit back and keep collecting those &quot;service repair statements&quot;; and, will more than likely have a &quot;BREACH OF WARRANTY&quot; lawsuit long before the 48,000 mile warranty expires.  That's still an option you know - according to my lawyer. Lawyers, you gotta luv em!!
