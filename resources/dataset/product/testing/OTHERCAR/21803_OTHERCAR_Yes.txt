            I love this vehicle because I have three kids in sports and I have to run them and their friends to different sporting events. Before I got this van I had a small car and there was never enough room for my kids, their equipment, and their friends. Well, about the van. On long trips the van gets 25-28 miles per gallon, it has a good air conditioner, and it has a very smooth ride. The seats fold down or can be removed which allows you to carry almost anything you want. It has a cd/player and four very good speakers. I love the front wheel drive because of the fact that I live on a large hill. The van climbs my hill in the snow or ice when others can't. It handles very well on our gravel road. The seats are very comfortable and are easy to configure. In conclusion, if you where thinking about buying this vehicle I would highly recommend it.
