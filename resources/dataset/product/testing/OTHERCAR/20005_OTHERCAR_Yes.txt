            I bought the Lexus ES 300 because I needed a new car.  I wanted a nice car with style.  I also felt that the Lexus ES 300 was reasonably priced.  I also needed a car with four wheel drive because I live in New Jersey where it snows often.  The ES 300 is the only Lexus with four wheel drive.  
I love this car because it handles extremely well.  This car has a smooth ride and compares to no other in its category.  
I have had this car for a year and a half and have had no problems.
This car also has a great alarm system.  I work in a city and no one has broken into it.
I feel that anyone should buy this car.  It is great and I have had no problems.<br><br>
