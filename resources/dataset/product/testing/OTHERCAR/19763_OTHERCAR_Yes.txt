            When I ended up deciding to turn in my old vehicle(91 Ford Escort LX), I was definitely looking for a bigger/nicer vehicle.  I had done the research on Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.  So I ended up going to a Honda dealership to look at used Honda's.  Boy, was I in sticker shock: 14,000 to 16,000 dollars!! I wasn't too impressed with the interiors and the body styling as I thought I would be.  

Then I saw the 1998 Mazda 626 LX.  I test drove it and fell in love.  It looked a little small from the outside but looks are definitely deceiving.  The interior was roomy and comfortable.  The interior noise is to a minimum.  Lots of trunk space. The ride was smooth, the control panels user friendly, and I still had my cd player.  The pickup and go was really good for v4 engine.  The styling is nice, very simple.  I felt like I was in really nice vehicle. The only drawback to the vehicle in the LX model is that I would have liked to have power seats on the driver's side. Other than that, it was great. 

So then I was intrepid on price.  I shouldn't have been.  It was really economical.  I have had no problems with the vehicle.  The vehicle gets about 25 city/33 highway.  

If you're looking for a vehicle that matches the bang for your buck, the Mazda 626 is the car for you.  I recommend it for all single people and families who aren't looking to spend a fortune or feel like they've gotten ripped off.  <br><br>
