            I've had my 1998 GS over a year now.  And except for chronic problems with the automatic climate control, I love the car.  The two-tone paint (mine is black/gray) looks great.  I get looks and positive comments on the car from everyone from teens to grannys.  The leather seats are more comfortable than my living room chair.  The six-way power adjusters on both the drivers and front passengers seat allow anyone to get comfortable.  One feature I regret not having is the seat heater.  I strongly recommend it in areas where the temperature gets down even into the 30's.  The Concert II sound system with CD player sounds great and pumps out all the volume I need, even at highway speeds with the sun roof open.  The 240 hp Supercharged engine has all the pep you need for passing, merging, and just having fun on the open road.  I recently got 30.7 mpg on a 650 mile interstate trip.  With a combination of city and highway driving, I average about 23.5 mpg.  The only gripe I have with the car is with the automatic climate control.  I have had it in the shop 4 times for various problems, and have another appointment tomorrow.  I have had the outside temp. display stick (this affects how the heater and a/c operateS), the outside temperature sensor went bad, and the heater fan chirps like a bird.  The fan motor was replaced last fall and the problem has returned. And now the LCD display panel has gone out.  I can't tell what temp the heat/ac is set at, the fan speed, etc. I have to keep playing with the controls until I get comfortable.<br><br>
