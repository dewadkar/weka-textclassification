            I have a 1999 Mystique LS.  I bought it in June and now have about 25,000 miles on it, most of which are from interstate driving.  I was looking for a moderately priced car and I researched carefully.  The Mystique came out on top.  The professional reviews were good and the pricing was excellent.  It came with leather interior and a electric sun rool at no extra charge.  I seclected the V-6 even though the reviews said there wasn't much difference from the 4 cylinder.

I have been very pleased with every aspect of the car and get lots of compliments.  The exterior and interior are above average in quality.  It handles like a sports car, although the ride over rough roads can be a little jolting.  Mine came with a CD player which I use extensively.  I have noticed that after playing two or three CDs, the CDs become almost hot to the touch.  I think this is caused by the heat from the lights inside the face panel of the radio.  The dealer said this was a commonly reported problem but it doesn't affect the playability of the unit.

Mileage has been just what Mercury said it would be.  Bottom line is that I would recommend this car to anyone.  It's a fine car.  Unfortunately, the Mystique is being discontinued in 2000.<br><br>
