            I bought this car new to use for my business travel, and, put about 100,000 miles on it before I traded it.  During that time the car performed reliably and gave me very good service.

This model has nice styling, good interior room, and is comfortable on long business trips.  Mine had the 2.5 Liter V6 engine, and, I found power to be generally adequate.  The only time I ever noticed a deficit of performance was at low speeds on hilly roads.  In these instances the engine had to work very hard to maintain headway, and, one had to endure very frequent transmission downshifts to keep the engine RPM up.  On the interstates, the car did fine and generally delivered about 30 MPG.  Overall, handling is very good on this model, and, it goes pretty good in snow.

The brakes on mine, the disc/drum set-up, were prone to fade badly on mountain roads.  I finally corrected this by replacing the front pads with a premium aftermarket set from Bendix.  Other than that, the car served me well, requiring only normal maintenance.

At close to 100,000 miles the trade-in value of this vehicle proved to be peanuts, unless I swapped it for another new Chrysler.
