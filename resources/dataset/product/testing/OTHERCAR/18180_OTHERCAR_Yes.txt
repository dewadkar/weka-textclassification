            I bought a new Nissan Pathfinder SE in 1996.  At first, I was tickled pink, very pleased with myself.  I loved the new body style, and friends who had owned Pathfinders previously recommended them highly.

For approximately six weeks, I carefully researched the SUV market.  Finally, I narrowed my selection down to the SUVs consistently ranking as the top 3: The Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, the Nissan Pathfinder, and the Toyota 4Runner SR5. In looking at these &quot;leaders&quot; of the SUV pack, I surveyed all of the consumer and industry/trade reviews that I could find.  I noted that most surveys rated either the Jeep first and the 4Runner third, or the 4Runner first and the Jeep third; the common denominator was that the Pathfinder consistently came in second, and sometimes first.  This applied both to the entire vehicle in general, as well as specific features (#1 in total cargo space, etc.)  All in all, I though I was pretty darned clever in picking the Pathfinder.  Gleefully, I trotted to the Nissan dealer and drove out with a Rain Forest Green Pearl (even the color was nice!) Pathfinder SE, fully loaded w/every option.

As I drove home, I realizes that the steering wheel was slightly skewed to the right (meaning that I had to perpetually turn the steering wheel to about 11:00 in order to drive in a straight line!)  &quot;No problem,&quot; I thought, &quot;I'll get it fixed.&quot;  Not only was the dealer unable to fix that, I have had a host of problems.  Here are some of the problems and the approximate mileage of the car when each problem manifested:

Steering Alignment (@ 50 miles)
Inoperable Cruise Control (@ 1100 miles)
Inoperable CD player @ 1 month (@ 4000 miles)
Road Noise (always sounds like a door is open)  (@ 10,000 miles)
Worn Lower Control Arm Bushings (@ 20,000 miles !)
Inoperable vanity lights (@ 26,000 miles)
Inoperable washer fluid pump (@ 30,000 miles)
Flaking Window Tint - factory tint not aftermarket!  (@ 35,000 miles)
Failed Brakes (@ 40,000 miles)
Impeded Acceleration Pedal action (@ 40,000 miles)
SORRY I BOUGHT THE D@MN THING!!  (@ 45,000 miles)

Sure, many of the problems were fixed by the dealer, but it was VERY inconvenient to actually GET to the dealer and arrange for substitute transportation while parts were ordered and the car was actually fixed.  Instead of Road Rage, this SUV causes &quot;Repair Rage&quot;!

I am still trying to get rid of it, and am disgusted that I have to consider selling for well under $10,000 (I paid $34,000 for the thing only 3.5 years ago!)  Not only that, but the resale price has been further undercut by the fact that Nissan now sells the 2000 Pathfinder with the SAME options, for $25,000 new!!! I feel betrayed by Nissan, who knew that such a move would have a severe devaluative effect on current owners.  Now I hate the very sight of thing, to the point where I can't even sell it because I am unable to sincerely or convincingly praise it to my prospective buyers.

It started as a love affair.... but that SUV from hell has caused me to change my whole attitude about it. Where I used to love to pamper it (detailed every 3 weeks) now I just want to take the old nag out to the back 40 acres, take out the shotgun, and put 'er down...
