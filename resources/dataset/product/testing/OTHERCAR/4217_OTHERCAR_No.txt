            My husband and I bought a 96' Grand Dodge Caravan SE Model. Dual sliding doors. Mid size engine. The car was quiet,the brakes just didn't work for about 4 months. It was supposed to be great for our growing family. We always kept the vehicle up to date on all maintenance. We took out a 3 year loan.

The vehicle handled very well in all weather conditions. Very comfortable ride, excellent seats, great leg and head room. My single friends laughed while we enjoyed camping and riding in our minivan.

After about 2.5 years we started to experience many problems with the brakes. We brought the vehicle back about 8 times in a 6 month period. Every conceivable brake part was replaced - numerous times. I spoke with the several managers at Dodge and at the dealership including the Sales Manager. My family was not safe in the van, we couldn't drive it.

Finally, my husband and I took the loss (we couldn't drive the vehicle so it wasn't doing us much good), we traded it in at the dealer for a 99' Grand Caravan. But after our experience we swore we would never drive a Dodge again. We went down the street and traded it in for a brand new Chevrolet. Guess what... No problems, great vehicle. We will never buy another Dodge again. I have made it my mission in life to let people know what type of Company Dodge Motor vehicles is all about.
