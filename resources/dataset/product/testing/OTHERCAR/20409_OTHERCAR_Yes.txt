            When I first entered the car market a little more than two months ago, I had my heart set out on a nice convertible.  I was moving to California straight out of college and I just pictured myself cruising along the freeways, with wind blowing through my hair, looking sheik.  However, those dreams were quickly crushed by those helping me to partially finance my car.  Yes, as sad as this sounds, my parents put their foot down and told me flat out that no, I could not have it as my first car (at the time, I was falling in love with the Toyota MR2 Spyder). 

So I reexamined my needs and my priorities.  After doing research on the web, I narrowed my choices to the Toyota Corolla, Saturn LS, Honda Civic and VW Jetta.  I'll have to admit that I wasn't really interested in the Corolla or the Civic.  Those choices were put on the list to appease the parents.  I didn't need anything large (e.g. Camry, Accord) but I wanted something with a little bit of a punch. 

When I heard that VW was starting to put their 1.8T (1.8 liter, turbocharged engine) into the Jettas, I knew that I was destined to buy that car.  Without getting overly technical, the engine cranks out 150 HP and has a flat power curve from 1750 - 4200 RPMs.  What this essentially meant to me was being able to smoke those Civics at the stop lights, which was all that mattered to me.  Well, not all.

After being unimpressed by the weak engines in the Corollas and Civics I test drove, I arrived at the VW dealership with my mind almost made up.  But I wanted to drive the puppy.  As soon as I stepped on the accelerator, I knew that it would take a major disaster to prevent me from driving home with it.  But it was much more than just the mechanics of the car that drew me in.

The first thing that surprised me was how large and spacious the trunk was.  At first glance, it was something of a major concern for me.  But I was able to fit much more furniture in the trunk of the car than should have been possible, so I am pleased.  The lighting scheme for the dash (blue backlighting with red accents) is aesthetically pleasing as is the look of the dials.  One of the first things I commented to my friends was the use of a nice sans serif font for the text.  I am such a geek.

Being ahem, altitudinally challenged, I didn't find any problems with the height of the car, even with the power sunroof installed.  The back seats may be a little cramped for people with longer legs, but I normally don't drive around anyone but me.  The seats are comfortable, but have this magical ability to attract dust and lint from all places.  Oh, the snap-on floor mats are a nice touch.  I hate it when mats slide all over the place.

The cup holders are pretty uniquely designed, however for someone such as myself, they are prone for letting things spill through.  Don't get me wrong.  They hold the cups, cans, etc. very well.  It's just that I have a tendency to step on the brakes too hard (they're excellent by the way) and open the engine too much.  Did I mention that I got the optional power amplifier (Monsoon Sound) with the car?  It's worth the extra money since the car is already equipped with 8 speakers and hookups for a CD changer.  VW said that they were planning on rolling out cars with in-dash CD players soon. 

Like I said earlier, I've had the car for about five months now and have put almost 6,500 miles on it without a problem.  I've read reviews where people write about the problems they had, but for me, the car is pristine.  My only gripe is that with this particular engine and an automatic transmission the gas mileage is a little low (22 city - 28 highway) and the tank a little small (14.5 gal).  And here, in the Silicon Valley, where gas prices seem to hover around $2/gal (the car recommends premium - it really does make a difference) and the traffic is horrendous (don't even get me started on 237 during rush hour), I've seen my MPG toward the low end.  (Since I've been keeping track: 2174.1 miles - 95.924 gals = 22.665 MPG)

This car is a perfect car for people who use it mostly to drive themselves or one other passenger.  This is not a car designed for a family.  For that, you really need something like a Passat.  But I love my little car.  I rave about it and yes, probably obsess about it.  Hopefully this car will enter a secondary role when I finally get my Porshe 911-Turbo in the future :)<br><br>
