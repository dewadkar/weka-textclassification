            Picture this.  A small light-weight, pro-longed battery life, easy on/off switch, wonderful picture quality, easy battery loading, very worthwhile investment, and a preview screen all on a camera.  Can't picture it right??  Well this camera has all that and more.  I bought this camera on sale for $99 around Christmas time.  I figured that, &quot;hey it was a digital camera, i could use it, and it was very affordable.&quot;  What i got was a wonderful piece of technology.  I have never gotten better picture quality in a 35mm camera and with this one, i can send pictures over the net to friends and family far away.  The software that was included with it is great.  Unlike the JamCam, the instructions are in a language that i can understand.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!<br><br>
