            Hyundai Tiburon 2001

A Shark by any other Name, Remains a Shark

The first time I saw the Hyundai Tiburon was a few years ago during one of my many trips in Asia.  I then had a chance to ride in one, I was not too impressed with the Tiburon at that time, and although it was fairly comfortable it seemed to be under powered.

Comparing with the new 2001 Tiburon, let&#146s see if Hyundai has made any changes to improve its performance. 

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Before I get to the performance part of this review, let me point out that the manufacturer did improve the look of the Tiburon. With a little imagination looking at the car, you can see the sleek and powerful lines of a shark. 

Hyundai&#146s designers sure did an excellent job at matching their design with the name of this automobile on the exterior. The interior of the Tiburon is a little tamer than its bold exterior look but it is still very nicely done. 

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The first thing that caught my eyes when I opened the driver&#146s door of the Tiburon was the two-tone leather seat. It had been quite a while since I had seen a car with this styling of leather seats.

Sitting behind the steering wheel I felt a little cramped-in. I was happy that it was equipped with tilt steering or I might have had some trouble to get in. 

The car I drove was fairly well equipped but some of the equipment like air-conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission were only available as options.

The all around vision from the driver&#146s position is excellent, the Tiburon mirrors are well positioned and even the rear spoiler does not hinder the driver&#146s view of the on-coming traffic.

All the gages and control buttons are easy to see and reach. The car I test-drove was equipped with an AM/FM radio and a CD player. I do not recall if the CD player was standard or optional equipment. The quality of the sound coming out of the speakers was not the best but still quite acceptable.

On the safety aspect the driver and front passenger are protected by de-powered airbags. 

As I wrote above, the space for the driver is a little tight and it gets even tighter in the back seat of the Tiburon.

The exterior:

I am not a big fan of small automobiles but I do like the lines of the Tiburon. Everything is well proportioned and the paint job was excellent for a car of that price range.

The automobile I drove had optional alloyed wheels and a standard rear-spoiler to give it a racecar look.

The cargo space is very limited at only 13 cubic feet of space for transporting your gear.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

The Hyundai Tiburon I drove was equipped with:

Engine: A 4-cylinders, 2-liters motor developing 140 horsepower.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: Front disc and rear drums.
Tires: P195/55R15.
Safety: Two front de-powered airbags.    

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Driving the 2001 Tiburon was fun. It is a car for the younger generation that wants an automobile that looks good but does not necessarily needs to be always the first to arrive at the next red light.

Comparing it with the Tiburon I had driven a few year priors, the 2001 model does have a little more spunk and does look much better.

Breaking: I did not have a chance to test the brakes under wet conditions, but on a dry surface even if I felt the pedal was a little soft, it still was more than adequate.

Suspension: The suspension was rigid enough and the Tiburon handle itself well in corners.

On thing I really like is the five years-rust warranty it comes with. I believe that for the price it sells for it is an excellent value.
