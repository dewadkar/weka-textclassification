            I have a very mixed epinion about this car.  The looks are still very current, conservative and elegant.  The interior is very nicely appointed as well.  It has leather, all the bells and whistles, and an automatic.  The fit and finish has held up for the last eight years, though it has been meticulously maintained.

The G20 drives well for the most part.  It has a solid road feel, especially for an ecconomy-sized car.  It tracks a lot like a German car, with meaty tires and front-wheel drive pulling the car on it's way and providing a confidence inspiring road feel.  The driving position is very comfortable and offers great visibility.  The four cylinder produces 140hp, but combined with the automatic transmission it feels less powerful than today's newer cars.  The car does get over 20mpg around town though.

I have always enjoyed driving this car, especially when compared with other 4 cylinders.  The problem is maintenance.  Items that should not need to be replaced so early in the cars life such as 3 motor mounts, 4 fuel injectors, brake master cylinder, and various less severe items such as a/c fan switch, seat upholstry, etc.  When purchasing a Japanese car, especially from one of the luxury brands, a certain quality is expected, and this car has fallen short due to the expense and type of repairs it has needed in it's 84,000 mile life.<br><br>
