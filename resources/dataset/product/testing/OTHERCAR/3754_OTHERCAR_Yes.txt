                  There's the expression - &quot;When in Rome.....&quot;, which explains why a &quot;yankee&quot; is writing about his pick-up truck. I was delivered to New Mexico-USA because of the military &amp; have stayed because of a lot of things. After a period of acclimation, I found myself borrowing another's pick-up for assorted reasons - finally I broke down &amp; bought one myself.
      I purchased a Chevy &quot;Silverado&quot; brand spanking new, back in 1993. It was purchased for a good price &amp; with little hassle. The truck now has close to one hundred thousand miles with no mechanical problems - well atleast out of the ordinary. There was a battery &amp; a fan belt, but hey - that's OK. When you drive hither tither &amp; yon, with miles &amp; miles of nothing between here &amp; there....well it's nice to have a reliable vehicle.
       Now I've altered this truck just a little. First to go was the stereo, to be replaced with a CD player - but the stock speakers stayed &amp; work fine. The next thing was the exhaust system; put in &quot;cowboy duals&quot;, sure has a nice rumble now. The last thing was heavy duty air shocks, cause me &amp; my truck plan to be around awhile.<br><br>
