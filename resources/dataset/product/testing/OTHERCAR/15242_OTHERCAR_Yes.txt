            I bought my 300ZX two years ago, and its been the best car I've ever owned. Previously I drove a Toyota Supra, and a Mitsubishi 3000GT, but this car by far puts them all to shame! The handling, the performance(!!), the ammeneties, the comfort, it's all there. Every time you get into the car, you feel like your getting into a top of the line sports car. Nissan left out no features when they designed this!  Even a stock 300ZX has more features then most fully equipped cars. Whenever someone asks me what year my car is, and I tell them its a 93, they never believe it! The performance on this car is unbelievable! This car will hold its own against any of the sports cars on the road today. And the sheer instant power it can produce while your driving makes for an incredible ride! Have found it to be very stable and handles great on tight turns and maneuvering at high speed is extremely stable.

And something else that is a definite plus with this car is the gas mileage. Most sports cars are notorious for getting bad gas mileage, but I commonly get anywhere from 18-22 miles a gallon with the car (and thats driving in the big city). On the open road and highways, you can easily get 25 miles and plus to the gallon. 

Another great thing about the 300ZX, is that you can find one in almost anyones price range. From 1990 to 1996 when the car was taken out of production, Nissan created practically the same car, exterior and interior, right down to the littlest detail. There are of course minor differences between the years, but only small things that only a die hard Z enthusiast could pick out. You can pick up an early 90's Z starting at about $5000, and on the other end of the scale, I've seen the 96 models go in the mid $20,000 - $25,000 range. But very few are on the roads, so you always get a lot of looks wherever you go!

The only con to this car, if I had to come up with one, would have to be the maintenance and repair costs of this car. Everytime I've needed to replace a part on the car, I've had to go thru the local Nissan dealership and have them order it for me. This car takes very few generic parts. But the up side of that also is that you rarely have to fix the car or replace anything. My car is going to be 10 years old next year, and I can probably count on one hand the things that I've had to fix or replace. The only other thing I can think of would be how low the car sits to the ground. Not that that's the problem, but the front plastic fascia gets rubbed A LOT and there are very few ditches or speed bumps you can drive over where you don't hit either your front fascia or undercarriage. 

I had originally planned on keeping this car only a year or so and then selling it and buying a new SUV, but now you couldn't get me to sell this car for the world! I wil probably be driving this car till the day it won't go any further!
