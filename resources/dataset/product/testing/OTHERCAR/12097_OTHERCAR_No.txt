            The grand vitara is the second suzuki vehicle i have owned. The first was a samurai. I really enjoyed it so I was thrilled to buy the v6. Lets just say, its very cute and handles nice.. but i live in minnesota and I'm convinced the grand vitara was made for people who live in warmer climates. Do not purchase this vehicle if you like to see out of your windsheild in  cold weather or if you prefer your feet to be warm. The heat blows strong in your face no matter what setting you have it on, and your feet will freeze if you have to be in the car for a while. You can also count on your windsheild thawing out after about 30 minutes on the road. My complaints to suzuki have been dealt with in this manner: &quot;yes maam, I agree, it is a lame design.. you'll have to call the rep&quot;. When I got in touch with the rep who lives in CALIFORNIA, she told me she has a grand vitara and her heat works just fine. Well, I'm sure this vehicle would be fine if you live in a place where weather is not a factor. I'm kinda guessing that motor trend tested this car on a nice sunny day also. one more note: my insurance quotes for 6 months have been anywhere from $900. to $1200. with a clean record!!!! freezing and cautious in minnesota...<br><br>
