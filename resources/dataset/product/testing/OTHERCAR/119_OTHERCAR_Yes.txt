            My husband and I researched digital cameras for a few months before we decided to buy the FUJI MX 1200.  We love the size of the camera and how easy it is to use.  In fact, our friends son who is only 6 can take awesome photos with this camera. 

 The camera comes with a 2x zoom and has a screen that shows what the picture looks like.  If you do not like the photo it is easily deleted.  We bought this one on sale for $199 at Best Buy back in November of 1999.  It is a great camera to take pictures at parties.  It comes with awesome software that allows one to create a slide show.  We have made slide shows and put them on video tape with music.  This is a great way to put several pictures on tape and give as a gift.

  The pictures take awhile to download on the computer.  To speed the process up we purchased a FLASHPATH FLOPPY DISK ADAPTER. This makes the download time much faster.

 We love the camera so much, my parents bought one for my brother for a wedding present.  Other friends and family are thinking of getting one.  The photos look fantastic especially on photo quality paper.  It really is hard to tell the photos from this camera and our other camera. 

 We looked at several other cameras such as the SONY MAVICA before deciding on this one.  We feel in love with the size of the camera and the price.  Also, the camera uses AA batteries and use rechargeable ones. Durability is incredible.  My husband dropped the camera on the cement and it did not break. 

 Oh yes, when we first took pictures we were getting fuzzy spots in some of the pictures.  This went away after we used the camera a few times.  I read on another web site that the camera just needs to burn in.  They must be right because we no longer get the fuzzy spots.

 In summary, if you are looking to purchase a great digital camera at a reasonable price I highly recommend the FUJI MX 1200.  We paid $199 but they retail for $299 and it is worth it.  <br><br>
