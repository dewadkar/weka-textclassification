            I love being able to rev this $18,000 car up in the high RPM's like the great italian cars we have all learned to love.  They cost 3 to 4 times as much. It has very good acceleration and some potent top end in to the high RPM's.  The styling is very good to.  This car is very comfortable for its size.  You will have to get out and stretch after about 4 or 5 hours in the car though.  The sound system is great.  The A/C is very cold for being R134A.  You can feel safe in this small car too.  It has very good handling and with ABS you can feel safe stoping.  If you have a college student who is looking for a sports car this is the one.  It gets 35 miles to gallon and is safe and cheap on insurance and is a great deal of fun.  You will not be disappointed with the car.  Honda's reliability is second to none.
