            As I have been around cars my entire life, (my family is in the dealership business) I have grown to drive many different kinds of cars.  I can honestly say that without a doubt, the Honda Accord is an incredible drive.  Although I only have a four cylinder, the 180 horsepower v-tec engine has great pickup and can blow almost anyone off of the line.  The interior is extremely roomy as is the trunk.  I have been able to fit four sets of golf clubs and bags into the trunk, and the car easily seats five full grown adults.  The sound system that comes with the Accord is definitely adequate, and the car is very fun to drive.  My only qualm about the vehicle is that in the winter, the lightweight body sometimes gives way to fish-tailing around tight turns.  This problem goes away in the summer however.<br><br>
