            We purchased this camera to document the birth of our second daughter.  My primary use for this camera will be emailing photos etc.   I did not want a 640 x 480 camera, but I also did not want a Mega Megapixel camera.  The file sizes would be unmanageable, and the cost would be prohibitive.

I selected the DC 215 based on the following items.

- 2X Optical Zoom
- Glass Optics (Not Plastic)
- Price

So far I couldn't be happier with the camera.  Overall indoor photo quality is excellent.  We are taking picures at maximum resolution with medium compression.  This produces a picture that is more than acceptable for email, and even reproduces well when printed out.

We did purchase a 16 MB CF card.  This allows us to capture up to 80 pictures without running to the computer to download.

Average file size using the setting above is approximately 200K.  This makes a great size for emailing.

Due to the fact that the camera does not come with an AC adapter, I would strongly recommend the purchase of some sort of CF Card reader.  I chose a IDE Internal CF Card Reader Drive.  This reduced the download time for 8 pictures from 2:40 using the supplied serial cable to approximately 3 seconds using the IDE CF Drive.

Using the above method, battery life is extended greatly.  I would even be willing to say that battery consumption is low.
