            My first foray into the world of digital photography is the Nikon Coolpix 800. I had a few requirements when choosing which model to purchase: I wanted something easy to use that delivered good photographic resolution. In addition, I needed to be able to transfer the image files from camera to PC in an effortless manner. For the most part, the Coolpix 800 has delivered on these requirements. Here are my thoughts:

<b>What I like about the Coolpix 800</b>
� <i>Easy to use</i> � turn the dial and begin shooting. Choose automatic or manual modes. Use the simple zoom function to get the desired distance.
� <i>Easy to review</i> � turn the dial to play mode and scroll thru the photos taken. Delete any or all of the images on the fly.
� <i>Easy to move</i> � remove the CompactFlash card from the camera and attach it to either a card reader ($30) for a desktop or a PCMCIA adapter for a notebook ($15). The camera save all images in JPG format, readable by almost all graphic applications.
� <i>Easy to print</i> � once your photos are on a PC, you can upload them to a service like Shutterfly.com or dotphoto.com and choose the print sizes and quantities for development of high-quality glossy prints mailed to your home!

<b>Where the Coolpix 800 is lacking</b>
� <i>Image resolution</i> � while initially pleased with the 1600x1200 pixels of resolution, after I began having my images developed into glossy prints, I began to notice that the resolution degraded when developing 8x10 prints. While 2 megapixels are enough for most standard size prints, I concluded that 3 megapixels are more to my liking. Of course that means spending an addition $400 on a device, but after trying the Coolpix 990 with 3 megapixels, I started to feel that the 800 was inadequate. 
� <i>Zoom</i> � the 800 can zoom to 2.6X full size. The model 990 can achieve better than 4X zoom. This is a BIG difference when taking photos from a distance. Add to that the higher resolution of a 3 megapixels model and you�ll conclude that the 800 is again found lacking. Unfortunately, the 800 was not designed to accept an additional zoom lens attachment.

If you want a solid camera to begin your life of digital imaging, then try the Nikon Coolpix 800. If you want a fully versatile model and are willing to spend more than $750, consider stepping up to the 990.
