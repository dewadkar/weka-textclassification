            I bought this vehicle as my second new vehicle ever. Somehow I convinced myself that I was going to be responsible and buy a fuel and cost efficient commuter car as I was looking at a 100-mile round-trip commute in stop-and-go traffic every day.

In terms of fuel and cost efficiency, I was dead on right. I got the Sentra XE for less than I would pay for a comparably equipped Honda or Toyota. I also consistently see at least 30mpg regardless of highway or city driving.

What I didn't get was anything mildly attractive or close to average in comfort. The interior is rather drab, with functional but Rubbermaid looking dials and switches. The driver's seat is only adequate, and not nearly supportive enough for long-distance driving. 

Also, the automatic transmission stopped feeling responsive after I logged 1000 miles. I know I bought an economy car, but I wish it didn't feel so much like it.

If you strictly need function, reliable function, go for it. If you want to remain inconspicuous, this is also the car for you. Any other needs, shop somewhere else.<br><br>
