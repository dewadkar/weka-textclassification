            I did a lot of research before I plunked down my 300 bucks for this camera.  I handled the Olympus 490Z (couple of little quirks with that - but nice photos - see my other review) I finally settled on the Canon S10 and was able to find it at beachcamera.com for $312.

Battery: First things first, when you buy a Digital Camera you will need batteries.  I HIGHLY recommend buying rechargeable batteries.  I purchased the rechargeable battery for this camera as well as a few 2CR5 Lithiums to keep as spares in case the rechargeable one runs out.  (I got my recharger and battery on ebay for under 100 bucks)

Memory: The 8 Mb it comes with will give you about 37 photos (fine if you only shoot a few shots) but I recommend upgrading to the 64Mb flash card (I bought mine from B&HPhoto.com for 64.95) 

The Camera:  The camera is one of the very few that are built with a metal case.  This thing looks like a tank (it is a little heavier than others, but I like the way it looks and feels) (It does not come with a carrying case - but $20 should get you a decent one that will slip on your belt loop)

The Flash: If you are taking photos inside, or in a dark venue and your subject is less than 10' away, this flash is adequate.  It does not throw light past 15' very well (hey it is a little point and shoot!)

Color: First thing I did was take a number of photos in different conditions to see how well the color balance was on this camera.  Subjects were out door scene of baseball game on sunny day, near pool with 4 kids (different skin colors) and inside a kids play arena where my youngest had his face jammed in a multicolored mesh net.
I was impressed by all samples.  Skin tones are right on the money, as was the mesh net (red,green,blue,yellow) The baseball diamond and players were clear, crisp, and the colors were correct.  In short, very impressed with its ability to accurately capture the color spectrum)

Ease of use: Leaving this in point and shoot mode ensures the camera is simple to operate...just push the shutter and it will take over.

Advanced users: you can alter the white balance to suit your lighting conditions (pretty neat stuff)

Software:  This camera comes with some neat software packages (you basic view and print stuff) but also one that lets you merge photo's together for panoramic shots (very neat)

I have had this camera for over 3 months now and have taken about 400 pictures with it (yes I am really running it through it's paces)  The photos I take consistently impress people and they are shocked to find out it comes from a digital camera (most folks say "I have one, and mine stinks compared to this")  My camera is coupled with an Epson Photo 875dc (that I picked up for 75 at office max.com -with coupon)


If you are interested in this camera check out other information at www.dpreview.com  (very good source of information)

Hope you have found this review very helpful.  If so, please rate it accordingly.

UPDATE: I have had this camera since June, and am still very very impressed with it. I still can not find any major fault with this camera, still delighted.
