            The Mazda MX-6 has been a very good car for me.  It is an extremely reliable car which has only required regular maintenance work on it.  There are many reasons why this car is such a great buy.

First its reliability, that is such a plus with any car.  Secondly, it comes with good features, like AC, power doors and windows and a handy cup holder on the driver's left hand side. (personal favorite of mine)
The stock stereo that comes with it is good to, I thought maybe it would need an aftermarket system, but the one it came with is nice for a stock system.  

Overall the Mazda MX-6 is a great but and a good investment for someone looking for a medium priced newer used vehicle.  The appearance of the car will turn heads as well.  Also good sized trunk for a sports car.
