            My 1994 SW1 has nearly 70,000 miles on it and has yet to need any major repairs. It was the first car we bought brand new and it has not disappointed!!  The ride is very stable and there has been more than enough room for the boxes and suitcases I always seem to be hauling around. Controls are easy to find and the engine compartment is color-coded, making it easy to refill fluids, etc. 
 
My only real complaint about this car is that there are no built-in drink holders.  By the time my husband bought a new SL2 in 1997, Saturn had corrected this oversight.

The new wagons are SHARP looking and much more modern than mine.  When Saturn changed their vehicle design, I believe in about 1996? the wagon got a big upgrade. Mine looks a little dated but hey, it still gets almost 40 MPG on the interstate and is paid in full!!

The best thing about Saturn is that in our experience their service staff do go out of their way to help you schedule car service, solve problems, etc. We have used numerous Saturn dealerships, including Louisville KY (where this car was purchased), Fayetteville NC, Beaumont TX, and Colorado Springs, CO, and have always had excellent service. 

Now if only they would make a van!
