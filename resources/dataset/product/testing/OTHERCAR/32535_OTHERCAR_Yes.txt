            Saturn.  Not the planet, just the car.  For all the hoopla that was made about this car when it first came out...well...it just wasn't worth it.  With every new consumer product that goes on market, there will be bad apples.  I, unfortunately, happened to get the bad apple of Saturn's 1997 SC series.  The only thing that Saturn has going for it is it's Service Department.


When I bought my car, I was faced with salespeople who didn't know a thing about the car, as well as a financier that didn't know anything about the Service Plans offered.


If you're thinking of purchasing a Saturn, make sure to find out about the Lemon Law in your state (i.e. Florida has a 1 year &quot;Lemon Law&quot;).  And make sure you get clarification on the Service Plan.  For instance, my car came with a 3 year - 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.  In addition, I purchased an extended warranty of 3 years - 50,000 miles.  As was explained to me, my warranty would be good for the total of 86,000 miles, not 50,000 as I have just found out during a recent service trip.
Make sure that your salesperson explains to you that the 50,000 mile warranty is NOT tacked on to the end of your 36,000 mile factory warranty.  When you purchase a service plan, for instance, the 50,000 mile warranty includes the 36,000 miles from the factory (so you're only getting 14,000 more miles added to the factory warranty)!  How confusing!


Unfortunately, I got the lemon of the bunch.  I brought my SC-1 back for service, and while it was getting the oil changed, it was hit by lightning.  Yes, hit by lightning.  And not to mention that every 10,000 miles or so, the computer decides to &quot;fry&quot; itself, thus ending in another 4 hour service trip.  And not to mention, with the car having only 45,000 miles on it, it's had to have the whole fuel system replaced.  And forget trying to get an explanation from the service department on why everything bad is happening to the car.  The answer I get is &quot;Well, you must have gotten the bad apple.&quot;  If I had gotten the bad apple, why not give me another car?    And forget trying to have a &quot;problem-free&quot; service visit.


Oh yes...and if you're a &quot;bigger&quot; person like I am, be prepared to plink down an extra $50 for a seat belt extender, because the ones that come from the factory aren't made for those of us who are a whole lot bigger than those famed &quot;dummies&quot; that they design those cars around.


The bottom line:  Very little car for a whole bunch of money.  Saturns (especially the SC series) is not worth paying $16,000+ for.  It's not very economical if you count in the innumerable service visits you're bound to make.  And forget comfort on a long trip.  Leg room needs to be expanded.  And let's not even mention the &quot;Saturn Stalker Salespeople&quot;!  Be prepared for at least a dozen phone calls during the month after your purchase.  After all, they're just trying to see if you still like your vehicle.


My suggestion:  Buy a foreign made car (i.e. BMW or VW).  You'll save yourself quite a few headaches.<br><br>
