            I have now gone through 3 digital cameras in an effort to find one that I will faithfully use.  A few years ago I started with the high-end Nikon Coolpix 850 and decided it was WAY to much camera for the average consumer.  Next I stepped down to the Sony DSC-P50.  While this was a good camera it was just too bulky to realistically put in my pocket.  Now steps in the DSC-U30!

This camera truly fills the niche of a camera you can AND will use!  If you can slide the front cover you can use this point and shoot.  While it only provides a 2 megapixel image it is still good for 5X7's, 4X6's, or 3X5's.  For me the likelyhood of printing a 5X7 is maybe a 25% chance.  At least 75% or more of all my family and friends photos are printed at 4X6 image quality.  2 megapixels exceeds this requirement thus the U30 is a good choice.

The DSC-U30 has a decent weight to it as well.  The body is made of Aluminum and mine has been dropped already, and other than a slight bump, still works flawlessly.  It takes (2) AAA's NiMh batteries (which are supplied) and comes with a charger.  The only input/output is a USB port on the side.  The batteries must be removed to be recharged.  The memory stick however can remain in place thanks to the USB port.

Startup time from "On" to First Shot is no more than 6 seconds (with flash ready & highest resolution).  Time between shots is also 6 seconds with the flash on and the highest resolution.  I find that amazing and much welcomed.  I have missed so many great pictures waiting for the flash to recharge or the image to process before being able to take my next shot.  It's amazing that a $200 camera beats out both of my previous cameras in this category.

Macro pictures were quite amazing.  I was able to get a beautiful shot of a flower at about 4 inches away.  The flash fills in quite impressively.  I took a picture in a total pitch black room and got an image rich and full of accurate colors.  

PC connectivity is a snap and works with XP Home Edition without any problems or additional drivers.

Size?  What can I say it is almost toy like it is so small.  It is about 1/4 the size of my previous DSC-P50.  By far smaller than even my cell phone.  It's why I bought it!  I wanted something I could truly put in my pocket and take with me to parties, get togethers, birthdays, you name it.  I was always making excuses about my other cameras.  I hated having to carry it around by hand.  This one will slip into your pocket and you will probably not even notice it.

Battery life is great, but get a second set of batteries.  Don't be a slave to recharge time with one set of batteries.  Have a backup.  I also suggest getting a 128mb memory stick or higher.  I get 245 pictures at the highest resolution with a 128mb stick.  That's plenty for me.
