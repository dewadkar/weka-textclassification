            I have had a LOT of digital cameras, from an Olympus D-600L, a Fuji FinePix 4800, a Nikon 990, a Sony DSC-505V, an Olympus E-10, and an Olympus C700Z.

I wanted a camera for taking pictures at the race track and for indoor photography at parties, etc.  Camera had to have a hotshoe and a really good zoom lens. 

The Canon worked really well.  It has some minor chromatic abberration, but that can be taken care of (for the most part) with a UV filter.  It's image stabilized lens is great for in car closeups, and action shots.  It takes great photos, very clear.  

the colors don't look at saturated as with some other cameras (the sony comes to mind) but I think that is on purpose to catch all of the detail possible.  I always run the pics through an unsharp mask in photoshop, and adjust the levels... the canon doesn't try to adjust the gray point and retains much more shadow detail than other cameras.  

I got some great fireworks pictures on the Fourth of July, the in camera noise reduction system is great!

I wish that it had a real optical viewfinder (the EV viewfinder is hard to use in low light, and hard to tell what it is focusing on).  The Pro90 IS needs a better servo mode, too... it can only take a picture about every 1.5 seconds or so... 

I also wish that it supported the focus assist light in the EX series flashes.  I use a canon 420EX with this camera and am very happy with the results.  

This camera has a very solid feel to it, I love the rubberized grip.  Very good ergonomics, too.  easy to hold.  Batteries last forever.  (100-350 shots, depending on in-camera flash usage)
