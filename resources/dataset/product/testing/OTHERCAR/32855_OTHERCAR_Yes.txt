            I am more of a film photographer so I was reluctant to buy another digital camera.  Previously, I only used a digital camera for emailing and web sites.
But I needed a camera and wanted a better one than my older digital camera.  The best quality camera that I knew of was the Cool pix 950/990, but I did NOT want to spend that kind of money.  I saw an ad featuring the Nikon 880 for a decent price so I looked into it.
I made the assumption that the 880 had the same CCD and metering system as the 990.  Im pretty sure it does judging by the quality.
So I bought it and I learned found that this thing takes amazing photos.  Same quality as the 990 but without the price and added features.  Its also smaller.
The camera came with the usual stuff: USB cable, software, etc.  USB is good, but firewire is better.  But better costs more money.
The camera has a great build.  Its compact, though not small.  It feels good in your hands.
For basic operation, its very easy.  Simply select AUTO, turn the camera on and you have a 1-touch camera.
Zooming is easy enough with the W and T buttons on the top right.  Take a picture and the picture is displayed, briefly, in the LCD.  Playback is simple enough by flipping the selector over to the arrow symbol.  Playback allows you to flip through the photos and even allows you to zoom in on them.
Those are the easy functions.  This camera does tons more.
The camera has features for macro photography, red eye, timer photos, manual mode as well as others, exposure compensation, and much more.  When you want to explore these features, the manual is a must.

As I mentioned before, the quality of the photos is great.  I shoot in full resolution mode.  There are settings for resolution, and for file size which has to do with compression settings.  Since I have large memory cards, I use full resolution with little or no compression.   Then I can shrink the images later if I have to email them or post them to a web site.

There are a couple of complaints I have.  The biggest has to do with the lag time between pressing the SHOOT button, and the actual taking of the picture.  It seems like 2 seconds, if not more.  In many situations, that is unacceptable.  For photography of stationary objects, its fine.  But I use my camera for taking photos of my 1 year old daughter, and she is far from stationary.  You need instant action to capture a baby's expression.  You can speed it up by using some manual settings and removing red eye reduction, but it doesnt do that much, and red eye reduction is necessary for me.
The other complaint is about the lens cap.  When you turn the camera on, the lens pops out (extends automatically with electric motor).  But if you turn the camera on while the lens cap is on, the lens jams, it cant come out.  And the pressure it places on the lens cap makes it difficult to remove the cap.  I guess the cap should attach to the lens itself and not the housing.
The other complaint is the battery life.  I understand that these use a lot of electricity, but the problem is that the camera uses a special type of battery that you cant get everywhere.  If the camera took AA's in addition to the rechargeable, then it would be ok.  But if you are in some desolate area and your battery dies, you may be out of luck.  In other words, buy the rechargable battery and charger.  I have the rechargeable battery and charger, and I also carry a few Lithiums as emergency batteries.
