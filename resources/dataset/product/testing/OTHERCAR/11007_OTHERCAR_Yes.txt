            My grandma currently drives a '96 Chevy Astro and let me tell you it sucks. After the first week she got it, it was in the shop because the muffler fell off. The van is louder than my diesel truck. Not only is it loud but the interior gadgets break. The first day the cup holder on the door fell down as we were shutting the door and was slammed in the door and broke. If you are looking for a nice van for a family with kids this is one not to have. The interior will look worse than your kid's bedroom cause everything breaks.<br><br>
