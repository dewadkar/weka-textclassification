            This is the second car I have ever owned with my first being a '92 Honda Civic DX Hatchback. I loved my Hatchback for it's size and cost, but it was time to move on to bigger and better things (150,000 miles). I knew that I wanted another Honda, perhaps an Civic Coupe or even an Accord. I really began to look at the <b>statistics for stolen cars</b> in my area, which I would advise everyone to do. My Hatchback was broken into twice, but never taken. With that said, the Accord was immediately scratched off of my list. I then looked at the "bang" for my dollar(s). I wanted used, but didn't want to overpay for a liability opposed to an investment. I've sold cars before and had a pretty good understanding of what someone should pay for a used vehicle no matter what the Kelly Blue Book says. With the Honda line, i felt that I would be cheating myself out of the best "bang" for my dollars.

So I began looking at Honda's Premium line of vehicles. I looked at the Integra, but that that was grossly overpriced for a used vehicle and so many people had them. I even looked at the '96 TL, which has such a beautiful style as well. The problem with the TL was that I couldn't find one under 70,000 miles on it. Then I saw it...the Cardiff-Green 3.0C CL sitting on the lot and I was in love! 3.0 liter, 200 hp dream car. I call her "Jade" for her color at her attitude towards other cars. She has everything I needed and wanted with the Sunroof, Power Windows, Power Locks, Security/Entry System, Alloy Wheels, Bose Stereo with 6 speakers, did I mention the Horse Power, Leather Heated Seats and a Huge Truck.

Remember that I am coming from a <b>100+ or - horsepower</b> Honda Civic, so you can understand my feeling when I test drove this coupe! I love the controls for the Cruise Control and Stereo right on the steering wheel. The heated seats helped so much on my ski trip this past winter because I have always been a little suspect of leather during the winter and the summer. I have eliminated the heat-on-leather problem with just a slight silver tint (hardly even noticeable) on my windows, which is perfectly legal in all 50 states. I love the arm-rest in the back seat with the pass through right behind it. Because I had a Hatchback, I had fold down seats, but I really don't miss them with such a large truck space. The climate control is great too with perfect displacement even to the rear passengers!

I have replaced the standard <b>Michelin</b> tires with <b>Falken</b> tires because the ride is much better with a stiffer tire. When I purchased the car it had 2 Michelin up front and 2 Falken in the rear and I rotated them after about 3000 miles and drove another 3000. The Falkens corner better with the 3.0 CL than the Michelin. My only con on this vehicle is the puny spare tire. I really want a full size spare, but I don't think that one would fit in the space reserved for the spare, which is probably why they give you that tire. It's not a doughnut, but it's definately not a full size spare. I have been driving my car since November 2001 and absolutely love it. The only other modifications, beside the window tint that I have made on the car, is changing the Amber front turn signal covers to the clear ones with blue turn signals lights. I love when people compliment that look from the other CLs out there.
