            I first saw and liked the body style of the Chevy Cavalier back in 1993.  I always wanted one but didn't get one until now.  When I did buy one it was a used 1997 one.  I loved the room it had in it.  I wanted a car that was nice and sporty but you could still have room in the back seat.  I have two small kids and needed room to put in two car seats and still fit at east one person in the back.  Well, this car did it.  Enough room for everything I needed.  It had plenty of room in the front and back.  The only downfall is there is not a lot of trunk space. I need lots of trunk space but it does fit quite a bit in the space that is there.  The back seat lays forward for even more trunk room.  The thing I liked best was the back seat was a snap to come out.  That made it possible to clean and vacuum especially after kids have had crackers in the car and they fall down where the seat belts are.  I got the standard and it is real nice.  The only thing is the gear ratios are real low.  They really needed to put at least 6 gears in it.  It is pretty quick...it can hold its own.  And the big plus is is gets great gas mileage.  We went 300+ miles and only used about a 1/2 tank of gas.  It has great long trip gas usage.  Anyone wanting a family/sports car....this is the one to go for.  It is absolutely GREAT!!!!  <br><br>
