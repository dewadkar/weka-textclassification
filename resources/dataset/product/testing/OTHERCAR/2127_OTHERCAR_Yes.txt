            The Dodge Spirit probably never won any design awards. It�s basic transportation with no delusions of grandeur. We bought ours two years ago and other than oil changes and minor routine maintenance, it hasn�t needed any repairs. I don�t put immense mileage on it (maybe 15,000 a year) but it�s made it through several Minnesota winters with barely a complaint.
 
Okay, so it won�t turn any heads while you�re cruising down the street but it will get you from Point A to Point B and unlike all too many other cars, will also get you from Point B back to Point A. 
 
We got the 4-door 4-cylinder version. It�s got enough acceleration to merge onto the freeway but that�s about it (there�s also a 6-cylinder version). The trunk is decent if not huge. The back seat is fine for kids but would be quite scrunched for adults. I'm a big guy (6'4&quot;) and the front seat is okay for day-to-day driving around the city but I wouldn�t want to drive a thousand miles in it.
 
Overall, it�s fine for general transportation. Nothing at all fancy or flashy about it, but nothing awful either. It�s a good car to get if you�re tired of throwing money down the drain.
 
How I came to purchase this particular car should be a lesson to all salespeople. We had gone looking for a used car and were going to spend no more than $3500. The first dealer we went to could barely hide his disdain for us and showed us several cars in the $5000 to $6000 range. We literally went across the street, told a salesman at a different dealership that we wanted a $3500 car and he went through his database and found a $3500 car. Some people just don�t understand the basics of capitalism...<br><br>
