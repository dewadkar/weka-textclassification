            I traded in my 1989 Porsche 944 Turbo for a 2000 M Roadster. The M roadster isn't really a Z3, but looks like one that goes to the gym and takes steroids. The Porsche was spending too much time in the shop, primarily because the turbocharger kept blowing head gaskets. I wanted a little car with a lot of power but didn't want to shell out $90,000 on a new Porsche 911. The M roadster certainly fit the bill. It is about as fast as the Porsche without having a turbocharger. The roadster has a lot more torque so you aren't constantly downshifting to accelerate. There is no turbo lag. On the other hand it doesn't quite have the top end acceleration that the turbo would get once the turbocharger was wound up delivering 2 atmospheres of boost. Most of my driving in over a mountain pass on an interstate. It is a long uphill, then downhill to work and back. Going uphill the M will pull away from anything including Corvettes. Top down, it feels like flying an airplane. There is a lot of wind at the top. This doesn't bother the low profile roadster (but blows my wife's Honda CRV all over the road). The tires feel like they are stuck to the road. The automatic traction control will slow you down on sharp corners and prevent you from squealing the tires, but you can turn it off and whip the back end out if you want. My only complaint is that there isn't enough room in the trunk for a full golf bag much less a trip to Costco. This is a great car for around town, a trip out to the country. You couldn't pack enough luggage for a weekend away for two unless you weren't planning to wear or change clothes. There is no way to turn off the passenger side air bag, so taking the kid out for a ride could be dangerous. This is not the family car. This is a car which can easily compete with the Corvettes and Porsches. I have never had as many people tell me they love my car. Its a babe magnet. It may be a negative that it creates a crowd when parked in the supermarket parking lot with the top down.<br><br>
