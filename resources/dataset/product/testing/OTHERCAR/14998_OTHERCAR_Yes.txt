            This camera changed my life! As an amateur photographer, I always thought I had a good eye. With this camera, what I shoot translates to pure art! Capable of capturing difficult to get low-light shots like sunsets, storms, lightning and landscapes. Has a nice ZOOM feature for stalking wildlife or non-intrusive spontaneous action shots. Multiple settings for creative photography on-the-fly, and instant play-back and editing features for destroying the evidence of unsatisfactory work. Great for beginners; very simple to operate. Best of all, it eliminates all the hassle of film processing; just shoot and download, e-mail to Mom, or upload to a website. I've gotten as many as 55 shots per disk! 

Be sure to get an extra battery pack so you can charge one, while using the other; battery life is very short. You'll want to carry this camera wherever you go! <br><br>
