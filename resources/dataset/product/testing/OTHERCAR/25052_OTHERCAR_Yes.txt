            What luck! While perusing the digi camera section at Sears I came across a $599.99 Kodak digital that was on sale for $299.88. Wrap it up, baby!

While, admittedly, that decision was overly hasty, I have had no regrets about this purchase at all. And it's going on six months now. No mechanical problems (despite my frequent dropping of this little dude) and certainly no problems with the quality of the pictures!

At first, all the picture settings were very difficult to achieve an in-depth understanding, but anyone can figure out the basics, just out of the box. Okay, okay, I gotta come clean here, I have this unfortunate confusion of the off button and the shutter button. You have no clue how many times I've gone to take a picture but instead finding that I turned the camera off. Smart! Look at this intelligence! Yes, I'm a dork. I accept that. 

Moving on.... Ahem......

One of the first attributes you notice and appreciate is the large color LCD screen. (You can use the regular viewfinder too, but not for the camera functions.) So you can see the screen in the dark. I never thought I'd actually use this, but I've found myself very glad to have it a time or two... or eight or ten million. Something like that. With this beautiful LCD display, you can review all the pictures you have taken that are still on the disk, delete them, magnify them, protect them from accidental deletion (*excellent* feature. essential), and many other interesting things such as making a slideshow from your pictures. The LCD also displays a Menu that allows you to configure the camera. But this little LCD deal they've got going on... It drains the battery, man. Big time. If at all possible, I use the AC adapter when I have the LCD on. So, the battery life isn't that great, but what can you expect? It's a high tech device. Oh, and something else I'd like to point out is that, unlike my cell and most other recharging batteries, when this is done recharging, if it is kept plugged into the wall, it reduces battery life. Which sucks because I left it plugged in on recharge mode for like two days before I yanked it from the wall, horrified at my ignorance. Honestly, it hasn't affected the battery life much, but I still wouldn't recommend it lest you're seeking a minor heart attack. I love this machine! I don't want to hurt it! 

This camera came with a lens cap that can be attached by string to the camera. This is a good idea since you don't want the lens to get KFC grease or the like on it. (Oops.) But it tends to fall off easily! I wish it would stay on better. So you can't jostle it around too much, say, in a purse or else it might be doomed. 

One of the most distinctive features this camera boasts is 6x zoom. (3x of which is optical, 2x of which is digital.) This is a great feature to have. For relatively short distances, even at the highest zoom (6x) it's not at all blurry. Very crisp and detailed. It tends to get a bit blurrier as things get more distanced, but that's normal. 
This Kodak has a pop-up flash, which can also be connected to other flash units. The flash is adequate and precise. Well-built. 

In addition to the LCD display, on the top of the camera there is a digital display that shows you how many more pictures you can take, what setting it's on (close-up or distant), whether the flash is on or off, and the resolution of the photos. So this is a nice feature, if nothing else than to avoid cluttering the LCD screen. 
Next to the digital screen, there is a wheel-type knob you turn to change its various modes (8, 5.6, 2.8, P, Review and Setup) and in the middle of the wheel is the on and off button. These buttons are all very ergonomic and with the exception of the shutter button and the off button, are all well-placed. On the top there is also this dial called the "exposure compensation dial." It adjusts the lightness/darkness of the photos. I haven't really mastered this one yet, but I'm sure it'll come in handy. 

This camera came with a carrying strap you attach to either side. Excellent feature! Much damage has been avoided because of this wonderful piece of fabric. 

The camera itself feels a bit heavy to me, but I suppose it wouldn't really do justice to being digital if it were as light as a $5 disposable, now would it? And I guess it's really not at all heavy as far as these things go. I used to have a Sony Mavica from the mid-late 90's and that big boy was a *monster!* This camera is contoured to be comfortable while being gripped. Very ergonomic.
Well, enough about the camera itself, let's move on to the pictures. That's what it's for after all, right? 
I had just taken a bunch of random pics, just around the house to see what this baby could do. Most of them were of my dog and like the ironing board, etc. Not too exciting, but enough to show what this camera can do. The first picture I took was of my dog's face. My adorable, perfect dog happened to be winking (yes, winking!) in that picture. It's hilarious. But anyway... I was astounded at the detail of this picture! I could see every hair on her sweet little head! Literally. It was absolutely amazing. I guess I should have expected that, what with the 3.1 Megapixel picture quality and all, but it was still a pleasant surprise. And the depth of the color was just spectacular. (The default setting on the camera is Saturated. The other options are Neutral Color, Black and White, Sepia etc.) Kodak seems to have the reputation for fantastic color, but it's amazing to see first hand. 

Loading the pictures to your computer is a snap. Very simple. And it comes with the software so you can store your pictures and do whatever you want with them. (Caution: If you save your photos through their software, it won't have the same detail and resolution as the original. If you actually want to do anything with them, save the originals, then a smaller copy via their software, if you wish.) One of the programs that comes with it is pretty cool too, you can make panoramics (like 3-D! It's kind of creepy at first) out of your pictures. 

So, all in all, there are only a few things I would change about this camera:
1) The capacity it can store, so you don't have to load them to disk as frequently. This could be remedied by buying more, but they're expensive.
2) Battery life. But what can you do? It's not that bad, anyway.
3) The lens cap. 

Other than that, this camera is both an amateur's and a professional's digital dreams come true. This is a machine that really delivers remarkable quality. You won't be disappointed. 

Kodak was Right on Track when they produced the DC4800.
