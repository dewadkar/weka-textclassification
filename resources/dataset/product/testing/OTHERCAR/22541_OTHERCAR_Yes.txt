                My husband and I recently bought a 98 Monte Carlo.  to tell the truth I always hated Monte Carlos, I thought they were to long to be sporty.  Now I know i was wrong.

     The newer Monte Carlos are not the tanks of yesteryear.  The look nice and have plenty of inside room for trips, and the trunk is a monstrous size compared to other cars in the mid size class.  The weird thing is that you would never expect all that space from looking at the outside of the car.  The body is sleek and very modern.

      There are only a few minor details I do not like about the Monte Carlo.  One is the fact that I am very short and I could stand if the seat went up just a little bit further.  Also it is not as good on gas as my old car and that can get rich with the way gas is up.

      All in all I love my 98 Monte Carlo and would tell any to buy one. <br><br>
