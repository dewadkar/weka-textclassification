            AARGH!!!! 

Three kids, a baby bag, football equipment, a dog and my husband's stinky shoes (yes, he likes to take his shoes off when he drives!) was more than our little car (&amp; my nose) could handle. To put it simply, we needed room! Our little computer business didn't help ease the strain on the car either. Computers piled all over the floor and back seat, it's no wonder the police officer looked at me as though I had just held Computer Warehouse up at gunpoint.

Room is what we got with the Plymouth Voyager (aka Dodge Caravan with a different front grill) Just a basic model - no frills - uh - other than the have-to-have tint in the rear for those football sundays where I'd rather the 13 yo walk home then sit in my car in his uniform for the trip back to the house. Oh, and the AC, I have to have AC. I don't care if I live in Alaska... I HAVE to have AC!

The Voyager handles nice although it takes some getting used to backing up from a different height. The engine is quiet with the faint Dodge/Plymouth trademark Jet engine whine when traveling at highway speeds of around 65 mph. Front seats were semi-stiff for the first 2K miles but are perfect now.

The Voyager/Caravan is the perfect car for young families with up to 5 children... just don't ask me to sit in back between two of them. It's versitile for business as the seats now are on rollers to make more room AND can fold down as well. This feature also comes in handy when the kids want to eat their icecream cones IN the new car - just push the seats up, lay down a sheet, and voila! Instant playhouse without the mess.

If I were Plymouth, what would I change about this mini-van? For one thing the spare tire... hey guys, WHAT is that, a CD? And it's still a PITA (you all can figure this abreviation out for yourselves :) to get to. And in my 13yo 5'10&quot; son's opinion... do something about the leg room for adults in that far rear seat! Oh, the poor kid... glad I'm the driver :) Great car - still glad we bought it!<br><br>
