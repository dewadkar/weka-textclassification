            I just drove home in this car today, through a lot of snow, and it was a great ride. Although, when driving i noticed a problem in the shifting. Whenever i shifted, the car would kick forward. it was kinda cool, but annoying after a while. Otherwise, this is a great car, and a great value.
I thoroughly enjoy the cd player. The sound system in this car is almost as good as the sound system i have at home. It's very powerful, and the perfect thing for tail-gating.

I recommend this car to anyone who wants a quiet ride home, in complete safety and warmth. The A/C is also noteworthy. For 19,000 dollars, i couldn't think of a better deal.<br><br>
