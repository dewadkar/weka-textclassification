            	After years of driving old used cars, I decided that I needed to find something more reliable.  My vehicle needed to get me to work and school every day, and I had problems with my current '88 Murcury Tracer.  It was 10 years old, but for the most part in good condition.  When the brake system went out, I decided it wasn't worth fixing and went car shopping. 

 I was looking for something economical but a decent size, and something that everyone else wasn't driving.  The Alero fit the bill and I loved it when I test drove it.  However, now that I have had it for two years, I am counting the days until my lease is up.  I have had nothing but problems with it since three months after I got it.  The power steering lines needed to be replaced then.  One thing after another went wrong, from the oxygen sensor to the breaks (after 25,000 highway miles!).  Even the switch that controls the locks and horn has broken - twice!  I would be driving down the road, and my doors would lock and unlock repeatedly at random!  It would beep when I started it or put it in park too! 

 This list is not complete, as it has had more problems than this.  I do have the paperwork to back it all up though. Everything has thankfully been covered under warranty, but that doesn't change the fact that each time something goes wrong I am without my car for a few days while someone decides what the problem is, and then inevitably have to bring it back when the parts come in.  I have to say, I miss my Tracer.  It had problems, but you expect that in an old car.  I did not expect it from my brand new one.  

My opinion is that you should not buy this car, or recommend it to anyone you like.  I have tried to let Oldsmobile know of my disappointment, but they did not seem to be interested.  Each person I talked with gave me another number to call and I got nowhere.  I hope this review might save someone from the trouble I have gone through.  <br><br>
