            I bought the 2000 Chevy Malibu because I like the looks, price, V6 engine and size of the car. When I test drove the car it was quiet comfortable and handled reasonably well. The V6 engine, which is now standard, has very good power and it also gets good gas mileage. I get 27-29 mpg on the freeway and 20-22 in town. The stereo is a good one and I like the combination CD and cassette player( I got the LS model). Overall I like most everything about the car and I would be a very satisfied customer with this car, but, there is a problem with the engine and I consider this a serious problem. When cold the engine has a very loud knocking noise the goes away after several minutes when the engines warms up. I took it to the local dealer and they told me this was an acceptable amount of noise and all the Malibu's make it. They said it wouldn't hurt anything. Well, it hurts my customer satisfaction level. I now have to live with a car that makes horrible engines noises every morning I start it up and the noise continues until the engine warms up. I bought this car new and it only has 3,000 miles on it now and it sounds like an engine with 300,000 miles on it. By the way the noise is piston slap which is a quality control problem. This is really unacceptable and I would not recommend this car to anyone until GM responds better to the engine problem.      <br><br>
