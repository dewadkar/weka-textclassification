            I began a lease on a brand-new 1999 Camry V6 LE in June 1999.  So far the car has been, essentially, perfect.  They even threw in free oil changes and regular service for life!

The ride is very smooth; several times on the freeway I've edged up past 90 mph without realizing how fast I'm going.  It's got great acceleration, and gets pretty decent mileage -- it has an 18.5 gallon tank and I usually get about 300 miles per tank.  (The majority of my driving is short-distance city driving.)  I've taken road trips from Los Angeles out to Bakersfield, San Diego, and Tijuana, and all three times it's been a breeze.

Everything is great except for a few minor complaints (some of these things may be available in the XLE, which I did not get, so if they are, then ignore them):
- The front passenger seat has no powered controls.
- It has daytime running lights, which is fine, and the headlights automatically detect the brightness level and adjust; but the downside is, you can never turn the lights off if the car is on.
- There are no pockets in the seat backs.

Aside from that, though, everything's been great.  The default CD player is nice (I actually prefer single-slot car players to matrix-loaders), the sound is perfectly fine (especially for those of us who, frankly, do not care about having $5,000 sound systems), the air system works well.  I've only had one minor problem so far; the rubber piping around the driver door frame, at the top, has come loose, so it looks kind of strange when the door's open (but you can't see it if the door is closed).  But it's not causing any problems.

Overall, I think the Camry is a great car, and I plan to lease a 2002 model when my current lease ends.<br><br>
