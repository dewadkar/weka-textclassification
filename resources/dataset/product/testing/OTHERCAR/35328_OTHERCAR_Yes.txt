            Until about 3 months ago, I drove a Honda Civic for 12 years. The car was very good to me, and quite honestly, I really didn't want to get rid of it. However, the air conditioning went out on me and I needed something new (especially in this Louisiana heat!!!).

My original decision was to get a sports car. I shopped and shopped for about three months, and I pretty much made my mind up on a Honda Accord Coupe. That was until my father bought a 2001 Tacoma PreRunner, and he let me drive it.

I was never a truck person. I grew up in the city and I never had a reason to buy a truck. Now, I still live in the city, and I still don't have a "real" reason to have a truck, but I am absolutely thrilled with my Prerunner. She sits up tall and she gives me an extra sense of security I never had in my car. Tropical Storm Allison? Huh? Lots of water!!!

Anyway, back in April I purchased my 2001 PreRunner. I got the 4-cylinder model with the stepside option. She's a beautiful truck, and I am thoroughly satisfied with her. I was kind of opting for the V-6, but after I drove this one I was more than happy with the power. These trucks are small and the 150 horses that the 2.7 liter engines put out are more than adequate. Besides, from what I hear the V-6 is kind of thirsty. But to tell the truth, so is the 4-cylinder. I only get about 18 in town. Toyotas are just not known for fuel economy, never were... probably never will.

The only complaint I have with my PreRunner isn't with the truck itself. It is with the lack of aftermarket accessories. I would like to blame it on the new body style, but the only thing that has really changed is the front end. For example, I had a lot trouble finding a fiberglass tonneau cover for the stepside. And performance parts? Forget it, you might as well wait a few months. The only thing I could find that was worthwhile was a K&N drop-in air filter.

As far as ride and comfort go, I am very satisfied. I purchased the regular cab, and I have plenty of leg room. I am 6-foot tall, and I still need to pull the seat up a notch. The white instrument panel is easy to read night or day, and the orange illumination is very pleasant at night. The sound system is also superb. I only wish the 6-disc in-dash CD changer was an option. Maybe in 2002?

One thing that I really enjoy about the PreRunner is the versatility. This is not just a "jacked up" 4x2, the suspension is essentially a 4x4, minus the locking rear differential. So all of urbanites can feel free to jump that pesky curb... drive through that standing water on the edge of the road... or perhaps even pull a boat with the greatest of ease! lol. And besides, how many of us "actually" need a four wheel drive vehicle? It's kind of like those 4x2 $50,000 SUV's with all that leather and wood-grain... looks are everything in the society we live in. The only difference is that the PreRunner is also functional.

On last note... If you have noticed from your readings. Nissan always compares their trucks to the domestic competitors. Be smart, go to the dealerships, look at the specs, and decide for yourself. I'm sure you'll see the light.
