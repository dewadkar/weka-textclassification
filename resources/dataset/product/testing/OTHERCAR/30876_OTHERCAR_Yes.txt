            This review focuses on the initial impressions after 3 days of driving (appx. 150 miles).

We came down to a decision between the Element or a used Land Rover Discovery -- very different cars, I know.  But the decision was based on need for something to haul people and stuff that was not a van or a wagon (my wife hates both).

The Disco was a front-runner except for terrible gas mileage and dubious quality control.  The Element inched ahead based on mileage and price.  But the lack of a 5th seat was tough to overcome.

I was initially interested in the Element because it just looks so different from anything else out there and could be configured to haul furniture, bikes, etc.  I've been driving a Saab but previously have driven a Pathfinder and Volvo 850 as well.

Driving:
My concerns that the boxiness would make for a bad ride were put to rest as I took it on a 'loaner' test drive up the Alpine Loop, a twisting, narrow mountain road.  It handled perfectly, no feeling of tipping or rolling.  In regular road driving I have also not felt any tipping as I corner, and I've taken some quick corners during the test drive.

I was also very concerned about the pickup - how would it handle hills and mountains, how would it handle straight out acceleration.  My Saab has turbo and when you punch the gas it keeps going.  With the Element I have been very pleasantly surprised.  As I noted earlier, on the mountain road it had no problems with power, no chugging along, just straight 'push the pedal and go.'

In regular road driving I have consistently been quickly up to speed out of stops, there is some noticeable revving up when you really push it but I'm told that is common with all Honda engines.  It doesn't stop picking up speed, just winds up a bit.

No mistake though, this is not a turbo powered engine and it can't compare to a sports coupe but it gets the job down and has enough power to punch the pedal and pass when needed.  

Steering has been precise and responsive.  Only issue at all with moving around is there are some blind spots you need to get used to - but once you realize the rear window/beams are a blind spot you can easily adapt your 'blind-spotting' and adjust side mirrors to compensate as well.

Loaded up with 4 adults has had no noticeable effect on the power or handling (estimated load weight of over 700 pounds).

Can't say exact miles per gallon yet, but the estimated 24 mpg was one of the big selling points for me versus the other bigger sport utes.

Interior/Look & Feel
The drivers seat is comfortable, but not overly so.  It does not have the ability to adjust much - pretty much forward/backward and some up/down - but I am 6'3" and it feels fine with great leg and head room.  My brother is 6' 6" and loves the roominess.  I do have some concern on how it might be on longer trips.

The 'suicide' doors are nice for getting cargo in and out of the sides BUT there are quirks to them.  You cannot open the back doors without the front door open, you cannot open the front door without unfastening your seatbelt (they are attached to the back door).  If you want to let anyone bigger than kids in the rear you usually have to get out of the front seat and move it forward.

The interior materials seem great so far, seats and rubber flooring look easy to clean.  Dash seems a little 'cheap' looking but not overly so.  Lots of nooks and crannies to store your stuff, but no place to really store CDs (rip them and use an mp3 player).

Air conditioner and heater have worked great, rear passenger have been comfortable even without air conditioning ducts in back.

I have not plugged in my MP3 in the auxiliary jack yet - but there is a jack and power outlet in the dash to easily plug one in.  The stereo pumps 270 watts with 7 speakers, including a subwoofer.  Speakers are adequate but not the highest fidelity

Rear sun-roof is fine, but I would rather have one in the front.

The seats, front and back, fold down into 'beds' - they aren't flat but with a brief test it seems they would be fine for an overnight trip when you don't want to set up the tent but definitely not a substitute for a real bed.

Gripes:  Add-ons that should be standard:

Keyless entry.  Even worse than not having keyless entry is that the driver-side door must be manually locked with your key as you cannot even hold the door handle up as you close it to maintain the locked position.

Seat back bungees -- how cheap can you be Honda?  Don't charge $15 for seat back bungees, they should be included.

Roof Rack -- this is pitched as a utility vehicle but the roof rack is an add-on.

Cargo Bin -- you really need something for groceries so they don't go sliding all over the place, include it.

Overall I am happy with the car and imagining plenty of excursions/photo shoots/road trips.

This is not a luxury vehicle and if you are looking for all the upgrades of a luxury vehicle don't even consider it.  But if you want something fun, different, with lots of utility, and don't need more than 4 seats -  give it a drive - you'll definitely get a smile on your face.
