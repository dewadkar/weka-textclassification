            This car has all the qualities that you would look for in a compact car. Its has an amazing amount of footroom and all-around roominess, considering how small the car is in total. This roominess compliments the comfortable feel of the interior and its nice look. The car has great mileage which is a relief for todays drivers who pay an extreme amount for gas. It is very responsive and has a overall great feel to it for the driver. It is great for beginner drivers because the driver has very good visibility in this car and one could probably find a car like this for very cheap. Its engine is a 2.0 liter which is higher than the average car of this size. For example, a lot of the honda civics are 1.6-1.8 liters. This car has a hatchback which allows for easier access. The look of the car from the outside, I would say, is not a rich-mans car but thats just my opinion. The car has a horrible stock stereo and rims. It does not have power windows and does not have power-adjusting seats. Other than that,though, this car will meet or exceed its expectations of a buyer.
