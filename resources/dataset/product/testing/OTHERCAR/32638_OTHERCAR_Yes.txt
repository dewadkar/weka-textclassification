            I've had my '97 Sunfire for just over 3 years now and have put 75,000 miles on it, mainly driving between Boston and New York City.  The car has held up very well, in general.  The rear hazard light switch stopped working and had to be replaced for the ludicrous amount of $150.  I think this part was simply defective, since I probably used my hazard lights a total of 3 times before it broke.

It needed a new clutch not too long ago, which is pretty much par for the course.  

There have been two recalls for it, one for air bag deployment and another for the ignition lock cylinder.  Both were quickly serviced at the dealer.

I am 6'4&quot; tall, and I find there is enough room for me in the front, though a little more headroom would be nice.  I would recommend some interior options like the leather steering wheel and shifter covers, and the upgraded cloth seats.  These make big difference in the look of the car.

There is a fair amount of noise at highway speeds, and the ride is 
&quot;sporty&quot; (or bouncy, depending on your perspective).

The heater and AC are very effective, relatively quick to start up, too.  I've been very pleased overall.
