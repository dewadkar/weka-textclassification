            I've driven my 99 Grand Vitara for about a year now. I live in a 4 season climate with heavy snowfall in the winter. This vehicle performed above my expectations in the largest of storms. Shifting into 4 wheel drive at any speed and very sure footed traction. I find the v6 to be the right combination of power and fuel mileage. I have taken this vehicle off road and have never been stuck, the 8 inch ground clearance will get you over most terrain. This vehicle is very quiet and comfortable to drive on the highway and handles like a car. The vehicle is well appointed and Suzuki has paid attention to creature comforts like power windows, locks etc. as standard equipment. I would recommend this vehicle to any one looking for an affordable and reliable suv.<br><br>
