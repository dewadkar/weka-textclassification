            This camera a quality with ease.  Professional yet fun.  I have owned other digital cameras but no has been able to compare to the Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD90.  

Professional

I use this camera nearly everyday.  When I work it is easy to throw the camera into a bag and go to where I have to be.  I can grab the camera quick, take a few shots, and be on my way.  The added bonus is you can see the picture you have taken instantly.  If you do not like it, you can immediately delete the photo and start over.  If the photo is the one, it is simple to put a block on the photo to aviod deleting it by accident. The quality of the picutes, from 1472x1104 to 640x480, all provide an excellent picture, depending on the size one needs.  I have found even the smallest sized photo provides a detailed enough image for whatever work you need the photo for.  

Also, being able to carry several floppy disks with the camera has several advantages.  Being as photos may be taken of several different scenes, it is easy to slip one disk out and another in so the images do not get mixed together.  I am sure there is no need to tell you the advantages of this over 35mm film.  Plus, when the images are downloaded or otherwise used, the disks can be cleaned and reused for other photos.  And, by using a floppy disk, there is no need for any attachments to your computer.  Just put the disk in and get the photos.

Recreational

From landscapes to pictures of loved ones, this camera provides you with stunning images.  Plus, if it is a special moment in which you want to capture everything, it takes one second to switch to the MPEG movie option.  Image taking a picture of your child and he/she stands and begins to take those first steps.  No longer will you have to run for the video camera.  Then the MPEG can be sent to friends and family.  

As I have said, the colors are vibrant and so real in the images this camera captures.  Looking at the pictures makes you think you were really there or brings back special memories.  And, with a camera this easy, your child to your grandparents could opperate it.

Technical

If you need to know the ins and outs, then here they are.  

Beside the regular picture ability, the MCV-FD90 also provides four picture effects: solarize, black and white, sepia, and negative art.  The pictures can be marked with date, time, or a combination of both if so desired.  Other features inclue choice of digital zoom or manual, exposure level (for those who know photography), flash levels of high, low, and normal.  There is also a timer function for those times when everyone needs to be in the picture.  These are just some of the options available on this camera.

Conclusion

If you need a camera easy to operate that provides professional quality images, this is the camera for you.  Nothing needed but a charged battery, a floppy disk with some room, and you.
