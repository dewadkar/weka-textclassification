            Wow, was the first word that came to mind after printing out the first high resolution pictures I made with this camera. And indeed I am still amazed every time I see new pictures. Sony has delivered an awesome piece of technology with this camera. You can make normal pictures, landscape pictures, portrait pictures, small movies and a whole lot more with it. You can chose between different kinds of resolutions. Of course, the higher the better, but that will mean the pictures are larger in file size. I bought with it a new 64MB memory card. And you really need it with this cam. The standard 8MB you get with it just isn't enough. That's the only real drawback of this camera.
It seems to me that if you decide to print your own pictures, the limiting factor will probably be your printer. Don't worry about the camera. I have had pictures taken with this camera developed at a normal photo store, and they turned out really well. Just as if I had taken them with a normal high quality camera.
Digital cam's sometimes have trouble when it's a bit dark, so watch out when you take pictures in the dark.
But the good thing about them is that you can take as many pictures as u like, cause you can always delete them later. Did you make a picture of granny and the family and did granny have a weird face on it? Don't worry, you can see the picture immediately after snapping it and you can delete it right away if you like. Just take a new picture and everyone will be happy.
It connects easily to your computer and with a little trying you can find out quickly how to use it.
Even I didn't know digital camera's could produce pictures that good :-)
