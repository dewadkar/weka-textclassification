            What is it about boys (and, dare I say it� men) and trucks? For months, I�ve contemplated the need to replace my little Nissan Altima (it only has 214,000+ miles on it). My daughter suggested the VW Jetta and for a time, I leaned that way. But, deep in the back of my mind, I couldn�t get past its size, it�s smaller than the Altima. So after long consideration, I realized that I really didn�t want to get it.

Time passes and one day my son, (almost 12) starts talking �trucks� to his dad. Now, somehow, in the process of time, I�ve managed to raise two rather opinionated children (heaven knows where they get that from!). My son not only wants to talk trucks, but a very specific truck, the 2001 Ram 3500 dually. You�ve got to know that going from an Altima, to a Jetta to a 3500 has to be the equivalent of going from a 24� sport boat, to an 18� sport boat to the Queen Mary. Or at least that�s how it seemed initially. So, to be frank, I resisted, for about 30 seconds (what can I tell you, he touched a primal nerve).

To set the stage, we have to realize a couple of things. In today�s world, women own the SUV market (no slight intended, it just seems to be their car of preference). However, the pick-up remains the unabashed home of the knuckle scraping male � kinda gives you shivers all over! A real pick-up truck says, not only am I here, but I don�t care how many Honda�s I had to eat to get there. Kind of the World War II version of the John Wayne vehicle � always wins and always defies the odds. This is the pick-up. It doesn�t apologize for its rough ride, or beg for your forgiveness when you feel every bump and indentation on the road. Indeed, you might say, a real pick-up insults your very sensibilities. And for some reason, guys seem to like that (it�s kind of the � I used to walk 100,000,000 miles to school when I was your age�).

Now a lot has changed since the early days of the pick-up. For instance, my 3500 is running with a high-output Cummings Turbo diesel. This little dude cranks out 245 hp and a whopping 505-ft. lbs. of torque. My son and I simply refer to it as a real stump puller. My one complaint in this area is the lack of an automatic transmission (and I think the 4-speed they use in the other Dodge trucks needs to be replaced by a 5-speed unit). To get the high output engine, you have to accept a 6-speed manual transmission, where 1st is used to pull the molars from your child�s mouth, it�s that low. Aside from that little quip, you clearly understand that this engine is meant to do more than burn diesel. It will haul just about anything you�re crazy enough to pull, carry or push. I should also note that it did take some time to get used to the noise a diesel makes (though insulated, you will have more engine noise encroachment from the Cummings diesel than any of the V8�s or V10). 

Inside, the truck is businesslike, providing wide seats (you really can get 3 bubba sized dudes across it � something lost in most cars today), comfortable seating positions (I got the SLT+ package which included leather seating) and well placed controls. All in all, I�d say, for a truck, the interior is rather pleasant. The gauges and switches are well located. And, if you�re missing the middle Bubba, the fold down armrest provides incredible storage space (I can even put a laptop in it), cellular phone and a lifetime subscription of Field and Stream. As an extended cab, there is seating in the back, although I don�t think anyone really had adults in mind when the designed it. I should qualify that. Though Dodge doesn�t offer a true 4-door version of the 3500 (Ford and GM do now), I don�t think I�d really want to add another 12�-14� to the length of this thing, it�s plenty long. Also within the cab you can add a variety of storage options, most, located under the rear seat.

On the road, the 3500 handles well. It does take some time to get used to, size wise, but that�s something that happens quickly. You also have to remember that there isn�t a compact parking spot on this planet this thing will fit into (just accept that for you, compact means �it�s going to take 2�). And, you always have to remember that it�s really long. In my truck, a 4x4 package, you have more than adequate ground clearance and enough agility to really get yourself into some deep�. forests.

In a nutshell, I�d definitely endorse this truck. It pulls like there�s no tomorrow (please Dodge, how about an automatic worthy of the motor!) and actually gets reasonable fuel mileage (about 18-20) for a vehicle of this size. 

I guess the real story begins and ends with the joy in my son�s eyes as he climbs in and I start the engine. His face transforms and he gets an ear-to-ear smile, that really tells you Dodge knew what they were doing when they designed this one!
