            This is my first digital camera and it worked out quite well on the trip. It uses 4 standard AA batteries, came with rechargeable ones and a charger. I found they would last a full day and I would charge them each night. One feature I liked was being able to change the ISO setting, which made it possible to get some very good pictures indoors without a flash (you can't use a flash in many museums and churches anyway). Using this and other features does require an extra step or two. I carried the camera in it's pouch on my belt and it was easy to get out quickly to use. The only problem that I had was that the camera takes a couple seconds before you can shoot, so you WILL miss some shots that you would have easily gotten with a regular camera. Also you cannot just snap the shutter as quickly as on a regular AF camera, it must be pressed fairly slowly (this may be true of other digital cameras, I don't know?). The USB interface was handy, although it says the software only supports Windows 98, it worked fine on my W2K machine.
