            To clarify, I am reviewing only the GS 300, not the 400.  I have never driven a 400 and do not claim that my review addresses the 400.  Further, I in fact believe that the 400 addresses my complaints about the 300.

Lexus claims that &quot;GS&quot; refers to &quot;Grand Sedan.&quot;  I can definitely believe it, because this is one grand sedan.  Although I do not own one, my parents do and I have probably driven it approximately 1000 miles at various intervals.

They bought this vehicle for the prestige, reliability and luxury, without wanting an &quot;old person's car&quot; such as a Mercedes E class or a different Lexus model (other than the IS).  To that end, the vehicle is excellent.

It was delivered to them in January 2000 and as of January 2001, there has not been a single problem.  Only the expected scheduled maintenance has been necessary, so it is a reliable vehicle.

Their GS 300 is Spectra Blue Mica and it is a head turner in that color because it is rare and it suits the car well.  In fact, the GS was ranked 5th most appealing car in America, and there is no doubt about that, as my mom is constantly complimented on her car by everyone, including random strangers in parking lots or gas stations.  Needless to say, the looks are eye catching and the design exudes prestige.

From a luxury standpoint, the GS equipped with the premium package offers all the &quot;standard&quot; luxury amenities, such as moonroof, leather, heated front seats, 6 six CD changer in glove compartment, 5 speed automatic transmission, woodgrain accents and power everything.  The problem is that the GS does not really offer anything unexpected when equipped with the premium package, which is rather disappointing.  Although the navigation system can be had on the year 2000 300 model, it was most commonly found on the 400 models only.

Another shortcoming is power.  Though the 300 manages approximately a 7.7 second 0-60 run, the engine is so smooth and quiet that it doesn't <b>feel</b> that fast and feel is often as important as the actual performance many times.  So the engine power is disappointing when the car is driven, although it is still faster than many cars.

Last, the handling, although crisp for a Lexus, could benefit from bigger, fatter tires.  The 16 inch tires that come with the 300 simply aren't adequate for spirited driving.  Unfortunately, the 17 inch performance package with the 400 is unavailable on the 300.

My real point in writing this review is to present the 300 as a reliable automobile that fulfills all the &quot;typical&quot; requirements of a luxury vehicle, yet it lacks anything other than styling that really sets it apart.  If you can spare the extra $10,000, do yourself a favor and get a GS 400 with the 17 inch tired performance package and navigation system.  You will be much happier because of the powerful engine, crisp handling and super navigation system.

I would recommend the GS 300 to anyone who wants style and luxury at a decent price ($40,000 or so).  I would not recommend it to someone who is young or young at heart and wants to tear up the streets, because the 300 is not capable of tearing up anything with the inline 6 cylinder engine!<br><br>
