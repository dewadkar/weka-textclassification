            When I got out of school I bought a 1996 Chrysler Sebring JX Convertible as it seemed to be a great car for the money, and it came complete with very slick styling.  I did my due diligence before buying it by checking with several automotive review sources and I did not see anything in the literature at the time that concerned me too greatly.  While I was a little leery of Chrysler quality, I had heard that American cars had improved tremendously in recent years and since I loved the styling of this car so I decided to give it a go.

Unfortunately, however, I have had many problems with this car.  Even more disturbing has been Chrysler's response to my eventual complaint.  Based on these troubles and frustrations I can only warn you away from this car.  While it may seem like a fun car at first, it hasn't been worth the headaches, and I only wish that I could have received a warning such as this before I bought Chrysler.

My problems have included:  interior flooding, blown head gasket at around 54,000 miles, broken air conditioner and persistent and troubling engine noise. 

After I was told by a mechanic that my car shouldn't have suffered from a blown head gasket after only 54,000 miles I began to research possible recalls on his advice.  While I didn't find any recalls related to my malfunction, I did find a lot of customer complaints on the NHTSA website.  I decided to write a letter to Chrysler and give them a chance to stand by their product.  All I got, however, was a phone call from them saying that they would not reimburse me for the blown head gasket because the car is out of warranty.  I felt little solace when they told me that they would file my complaint so that the design of future production cars could be improved.

I admit that Chrysler cars offer great styling.  I just wish that my car offered a little more under the hood as this car has gotten very expensive to drive with my frequent trips to the repair shop.  One mechanic told me that he sees A LOT of these cars.

My biggest gripe, however, is the way that Chrysler responded to my written complaint. My new wife and I both currently drive Chryslers, but neither of us will ever buy Chrysler again - the company has lost at least two customers for life.
