            I started driving a '93 BMW 525i when I was 16 (4 yrs. ago), it was a used car with around 40k miles on it.  I was under warranty for 10K more miles.  I figured that was enough time for me to get whatever was wrong fixed and take good care of it . . . boy, was I wrong . . .

This car has been nothing but trouble since the warranty ran out, and I mean right after the warranty ran out.  It's had a sleu of electrical problems including lights all over that burn out abnormally early . . . had many failed parts like the computer, transmission, etc.

Not only is the car unreliable, but . . . when I go to the BMW dealership, they act like they are kings, and when they saw someone of my age . . . they treated me like junk . . . often ignored me, let others go in front of me, not talk to me seriously, pure arrogance.  Made me so angry.  Same reason I'm in a Toyota Supra Turbo now (bought new) instead of an M3, BMW lost my business forever.

And, the price of parts?  Sheesh . . . don't even get me started . . . Over 2000 dollars for a replacement cell. phone that came with the car when my car was stolen . . . it was so ridiculous.

And, the price of this car dropped like a rock since it came out and continues to . . . I am learning that BMW's do not age gracefully . . . look at really old ones, nowadays, and you're like "Ewwww," 'cause you've seen a new one.  That's what this 5 series looked like in '97 when the new 528i's came out . . . sad, this car depreciated in value a ton.

On the good side, it rides nice, is comfortable . . . 

But, it is very slow . . . no power at all.

Basically, all in all . . . I was very unhappy with this car . . . I'm done with BMW.  On the contrary, nothing but praise for my new Toyota . . . see the opinion I wrote on that, here, too . . .
