            I picked this camera because I wanted a 2-megapixel camera with a USB interface. I also bought the Canon S10 at the same time to compare (see that review for more details). I was happiest with the pictures that I got with the Epson. The key pluses are: lots of control over images with shutter and aperture priority, a 3x optical zoom, a big bright LCD viewfinder, great solid feel including a big grippable handle and very good battery life for a digital camera using the included AA NIMH batteries (I got a good 80 shots off one charge). The key negatives were: size (it's about the size of a small SLR) and a slight sluggishness in terms of the delay between squeezing the button and getting the shot, and also between shots sometimes. But I got fabulous 8x10 prints. More importantly, I was able to shoot a lot of pictures, see on the LCD how they came out instantly (not true on the Canon, you have to switch modes), quickly delete the ones that I didn't like, and shoot some more. I couldn't do this on the Canon S10 becuase it's harder to see on the smaller LCD, it takes more keystrokes (4) to delete a photo and the included lithium battery dies after about 40 shots. The flash on the Epson is also a little more powerful than the Canon. A nice plus is that the NIMH rechargeable batteries are included.<br><br>
