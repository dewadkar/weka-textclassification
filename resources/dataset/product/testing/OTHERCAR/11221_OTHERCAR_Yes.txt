            Looking back on the 12 months I have owned this van, I am trying to convince myself that I should like it more than I do. It is comfortable and I like the integrated child seats. It handles well for a van. Seats are on the harder side, which I like for longer trips. MPG is about 17 in mixed driving, which I think is low for a van. My last van--a 1993 Grand Voyager 2WD got 20 mixed driving. Acceleration is OK, but needs a bit more power. All Chrysler AWD vans have the 3.8 liter V6 and it does use more fuel than the 3.3 without AWD. It drives more like a car than a truck, but there is a heavy feel to the van. There are a few rattles, but overall, not too many. One gripe is the paint. I am seeing very tiny rust spots all over the van. You really have to look close, but I am concerned about major paint worries in the future. Mine is metallic pearl white. There have been a lot of recalls on this van. I also have had problems with the AWD system. The rear driveline and one rear bearing have been replaced as well as a vacuum pump that activates the AWD system. The dealer has been decent to work with. I have an extended warranty that has been great with the $50 deductible per visit, and it covers almost everything up to 100,000 miles. These vans are substantially more expensive than the Caravans and I doubt there is much difference. I would not buy one new, but used, they can be a decent buy. Overall, the reliability is decent and I still cannot find any van that is as good for the money. Isn't there something else this big (in a van) for a decent price used?? Would I buy one again--probably
