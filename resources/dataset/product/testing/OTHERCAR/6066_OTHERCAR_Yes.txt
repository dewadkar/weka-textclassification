            I bought the 2002 Tahoe in July of 2002 and rate it an 8 out of 10 so far. Currently at 19,300 miles. A great looking truck. Amenities are excellent. Fit and finish is good. Handling is good for this heavy truck - it doesn't feel heavy when driving around town. Cargo space is huge!

A commanding view of the road from the Tahoe perch! Power side view mirrors afford excellent views of the traffic around you. Rear view mirror auto dims and has compass and thermometer. I love these perks.
 
The 8 way power heated seats are the best I've ever sat in in a car. I know this because I have a chronically bad back, and comfort is very important to me. I love the armrests in the front seats, but they have to be in the up position to lock/unlock your seatbelt. Friends have stated the back seats are the most comfortable they have ever sat in, and I concur. The leather, however, can be very slippery after being cleaned! The third row seats aren't comfortable for any length of time for an adult, but for kids they are fine. They remove somewhat easily as well. Just watch your fingers on the latches when manipulating them into the up/down positions. If I had one complaint about the seating it would be that sometimes the "high" setting on the seat warmers is too hot!

The in-dash CD is more than adequate and the speaker system is very good for factory make. You can store 4-5 CD's in a handy compartment under the CD player. Backseat passengers have their own sound system controls and can listen to a different component (tape, CD, radio) than front seat passengers by using earphones. Haven't actually used this yet, since I am always in the front!

The center console provides a vast amount of extra storage space. Also on the front console is a flip up panel that hides two 12 volt plugs and a cigarette lighter. This is a nice feature, as my wife and I can charge both our cell phones at the same time! The glove box is adequate in size.
Reaching the radio and air controls is difficult from the passenger seat. However, the air controls allow you various options to cool or heat the car. You can use only the front vents, only the back vents, or any mixture in between.

The engine is powerful, as a V8 should be. As with any heavy truck, the faster you go the less maneuverable the truck becomes (roll). So my driving has actually improved (i.e., safer) due to having to drive slower! (I'm a lead foot). 

The on demand four wheel drive system was very good in the heavy snows we got here in NJ this past winter. I had no problems getting around at all, which is why I bought a 4x4 in the first place. 

Anti-lock brakes kick in when you least want them to. I really do not like anti-lock brakes at all because of the unpredictability of what they will do. (maybe it's me?!) There have been moments when I have nearly rear ended other cars because the road surface was a little wet or slick and the brakes wanted to pump themselves unnecessarily. Scares the heck out of me!

Early on, the passenger side plastic door lock cover came off, but the dealer replaced it under warranty. They told me they had a recall for this defect at one time. No big deal here.

My aftermarket sunroof - installed through the dealer - was a nightmare. It kept having to be re-set or not working at all. Several attempts to get it fixed at the dealer failed due to rather dim witted service people. I finally got them to have their sunroof provider re-wire the whole thing, and now I have no problems. 

My antenna broke at, or was broken by, a car wash. Word to the wise - go to a hand-wash car wash! They can't just replace the antenna if the post into which it is screwed snaps. They have to take apart the dash to put in a new base and then put on new antenna!! Four hours later, I got my car back, but what a pain! Can't they do a re-design on this?

The standard trailer hitch is great. I bought a Thule bike carrier and love being able to bring my bike anywhere with ease.

Gas mileage averages anywhere from 13-19 mpg for my 4x4. But this was expected. I knew it going in, so I can't really complain! However, the fuel tank is so large that stopping for gas on road trips isn't all that frequent. On a recent road trip back from Myrtle Beach area, we stopped only once to fill up again before reaching NJ.

Squeaks in the interior usually emanate from the aftermarket sunroof. Closing the sunroof cover eliminates/covers the problem. Other squeaks have yet to make themselves known.

One problem recently "discovered" is that while making turns (on smooth pavement) I notice a clicking(?)/tapping(?) sensation within the steering column and steering wheel. It is not so much a sound as a "bumping." I am still trying to determine if it is for real or not.

All in all my wife and I love our Tahoe. It will be especially useful when our first child is born in October, and we need to lug baby stuff everywhere we go.

Update: 6-19-2003:
Took the car in for that sound in the steering column which was identified on the paperwork as :"Steering intermediate shaft loose and clunking slightly. Remove steering shaft and lubricate as per service bulletin. Road test for performance."
So that was fixed free of charge under the warranty. Also found another area Chevrolet dealer which is far and away superior to the dealer from which I bought the Tahoe. They even washed the car for me after fixing the steering column problem and changing the oil! 
Truck is running great and everyone that rides in it absolutely loves it - especially the seats!
