            In the last ten years, I have owned seven different vehicles, many different makes and models. Because I work at a car dealership, I get the dubious pleasure of seeing new and used cars everyday when I go to work, and that inevitably leads to the purchase of something different just about every other year. I cannot seem to walk the gauntlet of the front line of vehicles without having something catch my eye. Three years ago, I fell for a 1993 Toyota Corolla LE. It was a green beauty, fully loaded with power everything and cruise control. It was a great car, but the mileage was a little high, so I started checking out the inventory again.

I decided it was time for my first brand new vehicle. I loved my 1993 Corolla so much, I settled on the 1999 CE. If you are unfamiliar with the difference between VE, CE, and LE, here's the basic rundown: 

VE - stands for Value Edition, otherwise known as the &quot;strippy&quot; model. All manual controls and manual transmission. 

CE - Classic Edition, has power locks and windows, 4 speed automatic transmission

LE - Luxury Edition, power everything, 5 speed automatic transmission, and cruise control.

I chose the CE thinking that Cruise was not a very important feature to me. Wow, was I ever wrong. I think Cruise Control is one of those features that seems unimportant untill it's gone! I miss it everytime I drive on the freeway.

The car itself is great. It has a nice body style, roomy interior and gets good gas mileage. I have had the Corolla for 10 months, and other than oil changes, it hasn't been in the shop yet. Unfortunately, due to the clumsiness of the driver, (me!!), I have a cracked windshield and a lovely little dent from a renegade shopping cart at the grocery store. I am slowly learning the perils of leasing a vehicle. I must repair these things before turning the vehicle in, or else pay the penalty. Somehow, I am also driving over my allotted 15,000 miles per year. A fact that will also cost me at the end of my lease. 

The Corolla handles extremely well, and accelerates like a champ. I have the 4 speed, but I rarely feel the need for extra speed. I recommend this car for small families, and single people who like to transport friends, luggage or just a lot of junk. I wish the Corolla was a little sportier in appearance, it really looks like a small version of the Camry, but all in all, it's the only car I have liked enough to buy twice!
