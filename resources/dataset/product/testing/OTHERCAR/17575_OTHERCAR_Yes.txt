            I am leasing my second Toyota Tacoma 4x2 and will consider a third when the lease is up on this one.  My first was a 1996 with all power, 5 speed, AC, cruise, extended cab, etc.  My second is a 1998 with the same equipment.  

I can honestly say that I haven't had a minutes problem with either truck. The only recall was the front end of the first truck and that was handled proactively by Toyota (The recall involved a potential problem caused by hitting something like a speed bump at 35 mph.).

The Tacoma has good power and economy.  I drive it daily to work (40 miles per day) and it's like driving a car!  I am 6'5&quot; tall and I am completely comfortable in the cab.  The extended cab is great for the extra storage and we've used it in a pinch for the kids.  They wouldn't want to travel a great distance back there though.  It can handle a decent payload for its size, too.

It's a great truck and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an occasional utility vehicle that drives well, looks good, and is very useful.<br><br>
