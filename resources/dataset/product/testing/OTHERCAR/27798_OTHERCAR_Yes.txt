            I purchased the Canon S100 Digital Elph just 30 days ago. after taking 1,190 pictures I love it even more than the first week I used it. The camera's first real test came on a ski trip to Winter Park Colorado. Let me tell you how rugged this little all metal camera is. I took an awful spill, head first at high speed landing directly on the camera which was tucked into my breast pocket. (I am 180+ lbs) The camera functioned perfectly there after and for the rest of the trip in cold weather conditions. I did not really know what to expect from a 'travel camera' having never owned any type of camera before. I was very delighted with the results. I purchased an extra battery and a 64MB CF card (highly recommended) for this extended trip. I shot most of the pictures in the larger size 1600X1200 and reduced them to fit my laptop screen after filling up the CF card (110) pictures. I experimented with the manual camera settings (which are minimal, but that is OK.) as I have heard that some outdoor images can be dark in nature. Here is what I did to achieve good to great image quality. Most images (90%) were shot in manual mode. Use sunny/cloudy as need outdoors, auto white balance,+1/3 EV , w/flash indoors. Most images were conditioned (takes about 1 sec.) with the Thumbs+ Software, hit [shift-G]. That was the only enhancement done. Note - Most images that are 'too dark' were taken in auto mode, especially outdoor pics. These settings thus far have produced prints that are indistinguishable from photo-chemical prints (usually better). Images larger than 640 were resized from 1600 X 1200 (using TH+) to 1024 or 800 to better accommodate most displays. What I love most about this camera is the super portable size. We got many shots that we never would have taken with my wife's (large) 35mm camera. In retrospect some of those snaps were the best pics of the lot! I highly recommend this camera with the following options considered as mandatory: PCMCIA card for downloading pictures to laptop,64MB CF card,2nd battery,$15.00 Canon Powershot case,Thumbs plus v4 software to quickly enhance pictures. 
PRINTING:
Seeing the prints is what will really impress you about this camera. I don't own a printer, I use <B>www.ofoto.com </B>to process my hard copies. I have tried others and they are the Cadillac.
