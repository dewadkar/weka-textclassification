            I have a 1995 Neon, and I love it. I bought it new, and have enjoyed it for the past 5 years with no major problems to speak of. 

The thing that led me to want a Neon was, I have to admit, those &quot;Hi!&quot; billboard campaigns. I loved the headlights, and how the car was so &quot;friendly&quot;. I had to have one. I ended up buying an Iris purple 4 door Neon. My purple car and I were the talk of my college campus, because the Neons were still relatively new, and plus, mine was purple.

The handling is great, and it has excellent pickup. I love the interior... very clean and all the knobs and buttons are easy to access. The stereo system, for a base system, is great. The fold down seats are handy for transporting larger items, like suitcases, or even skis. It has a roomy trunk as well.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, reliable car. For under $13,000 you can get a Neon with some nice options. Great for college students who need a good car at a great price.
