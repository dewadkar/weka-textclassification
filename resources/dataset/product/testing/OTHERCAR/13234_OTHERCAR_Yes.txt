            After I was lusting for a minivan for a couple years I was finally able to break my husband down in May of 1999.  We looked at several different models (or at least tried to).  No dealer in my area had any Toyota Siennas in stock - same for the Honda Odyssey.  There was no way I was buying a Ford Windstar so we looked at the &quot;classic&quot; Voyager/Caravan.  We bought a 1999 Grand Voyager SE (sticker price about $26,000).  I really like having enough room for our family plus the kids' friends and even my own friends.  After a snowstorm the last couple days I found that it handles great in the snow - even better than our 4wd SUV.  The removable seats are also a plus for us.  I honestly haven't found anything negative for us about this vehicle yet.  It's a great vehicle for &quot;soccer moms&quot; and growing families.  All in all I'm very happy with our Voyager and would recommend it to anyone looking for a minivan.<br><br>
