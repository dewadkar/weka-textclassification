            Our 1996 Toyota Camry LE is the most family-friendly car I have every owned.  My husband can use it for business, I use it to haul groceries and my 6-month-old daughter(and all the related baby stuff), and we both use it to transport large items, like skis or lumber.  

The car has a stylish look and a comfortable ride.  This makes it fun to use for a &quot;night on the town&quot;, though we don't get many of those since the baby arrived.  My husband enjoys using it for business-related entertainment, as well.  We can easily fit one set of in-laws in the back seat)one person on each side of the car seat).

Since the rear seats are split (60/40),we can easily fold down all or part of the rear seat to extend the trunk capacity.  This was very handy when we purchased baby furniture. 

Our car has a V6 engine, which really makes a difference in acceleration, especially in merging traffic.  This car has a lot of pep for a sedan!

The best thing about this car, however, is the reliability.  I have never experienced any type of problem, other than regular maintenance (brakes, windshield wipers, etc.) and the items that I have had serviced do not appear to be any more expensive than American cars that I have owned.  

For a new mother, this comfortable, reliable car is a dream.  Added bonuses are that it is inexpensive to service and it gets good gas mileage.
