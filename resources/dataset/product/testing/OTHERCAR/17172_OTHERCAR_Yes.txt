            I bought this car towards the end of 1997 and I still have it today. Honestly, I love the car, and I am not planning on parting with it. Being in my late twenties upon purchase the Nissan Maxima SE 5 speed manual transmission was the car for me out of the Maxima family. It came loaded with all the extras ( which I still wish would have been more ),sunroof, white exterior, beige leather interior, and the neat looking white speed gauges. The gauges were really nice. Giving the Maxima's interior a sportier feel for 1997. In the day they appear white and at night its just the reverse (dark with light numbers)

   The leather now that it has aged has stood the test of time.(* See note below) As with all the Maxima's interior it would be excellent if not for my smoking habit. The interior dash and all its components are in showroom floor condition. The power windows still work great and are as fast as they were when bought new. The electric seats still work great with no problems in the history of the vehicle. 

   The 1997 Maxima SE came with a stock Bose stereo and 6 Bose speakers. It was a sweet setup but of course I needed more. On key thing to remember with this stock stereo is that its not simple to upgrade your stereo but it is not all that hard either. If you are planning on taking the Bose receiver out (comes with a tape player and cd player)you will have to purchase a car stereo receiver that is a double den (about twice the size of a regular car stereo). This is to achieve a perfect fit in the dash. Also you will have to buy an adapter to make the new receiver compatible with the Bose speakers that are already amped. But most car stereo shops have all the parts you need. Nothing to it ! Again, everything in the Maxima works great! I have never had any problems out of the a/c or heat, clock, radio, gauges, etc. And speaking of the a/c its just like a central air and heat unit in your home. Just set the desired temperature and it makes the adjustments.
  
   The ride is sweet , even in my SE, which has a stiffer suspension. Which adds for better handling and performance. This baby will hang curves with the best of them. One note for Maxima owners is to buy a Front Strut Tower Brace which is nothing to install. It tightens up the car for even better handling and control. Its about 40 dollars. But overall the car drives awesome. As I mentioned the Maxima has great handling and with the SE you get a 16 inch rim. I believe the earlier Maximas in 1995-1996 might have had a smaller wheel size. 

 The engine, Nissan's  VQ30DE is very awesome and some say very close to perfection. It has won best v6 for something like 8 or more years in a row. This 4th Generation Maxima - revs hard and accelerates fast. The car was rated stock at 190 HP - 205 Torque and weighs approx. 3000 lbs. 

  I prefered the 5 speed which has proven to dust automatic Maximas and alot of other cars that have challenged me in its class. And to this day some 136,000 miles later the car still runs great ! 

  I have had so much fun in the Nissan Maxima. It has been taken on two road trips across the USA (east coast to west coast) not a single problem, no break downs. It can also easily handle higher speeds for long distances. And not to mention the quite engine. I did however change out the stock air box a year and a half ago. I replaced it with a JWT Pop-charger. Now you can hear the true power of the Maxima's engine with increased performance. You never would have imagined the Maxima's engine has a tough growl to it by adding the pop charger.

  The Maxima has a security system but did not do much to stop my car from being broken into.  It does alot horn honking and light blinking. But it does its job I suppose, with no real means of keeping intruders out. After all its just an alarm..for tighter security I should hire a night time security guard.

   As for as the color of the Maxima if you are looking for a white colored one. I would really eye the paint. The Maxima back bumper is made out of a different material than the rest of the car. And if you look close the paint does not match up perfectly. So be careful with white. Also, I think the Maxima tends to ding up kinda easy, but I have had this car a long time and this is nothing to complain about ( minor flaw )

   Although, I have not been in a major car accident. My Maxima has proven to be tough as nails. In the city a Lincoln Town car slammed on breaks in front of me. BAM ! I just knew that was it, off to body shop land. To my surprise my front tag holder was bent slightly and through extreme checking the front end was fine. NO DAMAGE.. and this was after a really hard smack. The impact moved the Lincoln forward after it had already stopped. Then only weeks ago while sitting at a stop sign someone rear ended me. It was a good JOLT ...this time I knew it was time to get out the old pen and paper and start writing down information. A big old beat up truck had smacked into me. I checked every angle, every crack and there was absolutely no damage, and I checked very, very... good. I am still shocked about these two events. It would seem the Maxima body is a bit bouncy and bendy.. So I am really happy about that.
 
    As for as the room in the Maxima. Do not be fooled. There is plenty of room for a person even 6'4"'s tall, and I mean plenty. The only set back I see is if you make alot of trips with four people. The front is fine but in the back the passengers will be somewhat squashed. I do not recommend the Max for 5 people for any long distance. You can fit five but its nothing nice . (SARDINE LAND)
  
  * I do want to make one correction in my review so far. The armrest in the Maxima did wear down. It did take 4 years before tearing. And this happened because of my arm resting on it day after day. Cost to replace $99.00 . I also lost my antenna in a car wash. Man, I could kick myself. Cost to replace $185.00
   
   Overall this is a SUPER automobile and I would highly recommend it for someone looking for a reliable car with good gas mileage, great handling, lots of speed (stock 1/4 mile 15 seconds flat) , looks, its price, and the fact that its a low maintenance vehicle. And this is coming from a Maxima owner who drives hard, and has now put up 136,000 wonderful miles so far. And I can also add this. Im looking forward to the big 300,000. Never parting with my MAX.... and hey come take a look at her now at www.ceasarschariot.com  !
