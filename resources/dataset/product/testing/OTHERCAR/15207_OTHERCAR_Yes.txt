            When we were looking for a car to replace our Volvo station wagon, we decided to look at minivans because we had one teenager (and one child who was almost a teenager) and family trips were too cramped.  You may have read my report on the Honda Odyssey, which we ended up buying (I'll explain why), but before we decided on that one, we also looked at the Sienna, which had high marks for reliability and safety.

I had a 1986 Camry a long time ago and loved it. Since I have driven Hondas and Toyotas, our family decided to try both.  The guy at the Toyota dealer pulled out one of the many Siennas on the lot (you can't say the same thing about the Odyssey to this day) and let us test drive the vehicle WITHOUT him. The Sienna was roomy and comfortable for all four of us.  We got to try the power doors (on another van on the lot) and they worked very well (they were quieter than the Odyssey's dual power doors).  

The 3.0L V6 with 194 horsepower (210 for the 2001 model) and the 4 speed auto were well matched, as they operated with minimal engine noise or "jerks" from the shifting transmission.  I thought the car handled very well, but when my wife tried to drive it, she thought the vehicle handled like a truck because she felt the vehicle "sway" on curves (sort of like what an SUV might do) and was afraid that the vehicle was going to roll over.  It did not (I did not expect it to), but since she was going to be the primary driver of the van, we decided to drop this one down on our list.  

Also, the option packages would have required us to spend more than we did on the Odyssey in order to get a similarly-equipped vehicle.  I like the Odyssey, but I have not heard anything bad about the Sienna as far as reliability, so both are good buys.
