            When I first got my Dodge Caravan I was afraid of the size. It appears to be such a big vehicle, a lot bigger then the compact cars I was used to. I was greatly surprised though because it drives like a small car. It has wonderful handling! I have found it easy to drive in even tight areas and not as hard to park as I thought it would be. I'm a relatively inexperienced driver so these things were very important.

I was also worried that my small family would get lost in the large amount of space but I have found that both children enjoy the space. They  have found wonderful uses for side storage areas. This is where they keep little things to keep them busy on those long rides. 

When we have friends with us there is also room for them. The adjustable seats makes it easy to find leg room for either children or adults. Also the seats are easy to remove if you need that extra hauling space. We recently went for a long road trip and realized if we left the back seat at home there was a nice space left in the rear of the van to throw a blanket in and get a quick nap. Wasn't too uncomfortable either and sure did save on the cost of motel rooms.

Overall, I would say this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. Low on maintenance and surprisingly low on gas usage too, high on comfort, style and space!<br><br>
