            Um...5 year old I guess since it just turned 2001.

Well, since reading some of the other epinions about this vehicle, I can see we're not the only ones who've had some problems.

Don't get me wrong.  I love this 1996 Plymouth Grand Voyager van.  Ours is white with gray interior and black trimming.  No rust.  Very sharp looking.  We purchased it this past summer for $6,995 with 100,000 miles on it.  The interior was, and still is, in near perfect condition.  (I'll tell you about the &quot;near&quot; a little later on.)  It's just beautiful.  I'm physically comfortable when I drive it.  I like the arm rests on the seats.  Everything is easy accessible, the radio, the lights, etc.  This is basically my van for running the kids around, and our van as a family on weekends.  My husband has his work truck.

But, it did have a couple of mechanical problems when we bought it.  First, there was a belt squealing in the engine, so we made them replace that.  It was the serpentine belt.  And the cruise didn't work, which we asked them to fix as part of the deal too.  Would you believe we had to take it back to the dealer 4 times before they got it fixed right.  Sounds like almost everybody has had service problems when dealing with these vehicles.  But let's remember not to slash the vehicle just because of poor service.

Well, replacing the belt solved the squeal in the engine, and they finally got the cruise working.  Then, believe it or not, 5 days after purchase the transmission started going out.  It was doing the same thing some of these other opinions are talking about.  Wouldn't go past 40 mph, and wouldn't shift.  What's the deal with these Plymouth transmissions?

We took it back and they agreed to do some adjusting and see if they could fix it.  No go.  It didn't work.  We took it back several times, each and every day, until they finally agreed that they were just going to have to fess up to that bad transmission and rebuild it.  Of course, we had to threaten legal action before they finally gave in.  

Well, that fixed it.  And now, after all those problems in the first week of ownership, I can honestly say we have had no other problems.  Oh yeah, my husband just reminded me he had to replace the thermostat a couple weeks ago.  Oh well, I still love the looks of this van.  It does drive nice and the kids and I look good in it.

All of these problems, the belt, the cruise, the thermostat, are all normal wear and tear things on a vehicle with 100,000 miles on it.  But, I don't agree that the transmissions should cause as much trouble as they do in these vans.

No, I probably won't buy another Plymouth van, but right now I'm not in the market for another vehicle anyway.  I have to finish paying for this one first, and hope it lasts the next 3 years while I'm doing just that.

All in all, this is a sharp looking vehicle.  And even though we had some problems in the beginning, I'm satisfied with its performance over the last several months.

Oh, and about that &quot;near perfect&quot; interior...one bit of advice...don't ever leave an unopened can of pop sit in the tray over night when the temperatures are below zero!  You won't like the site of the van the next morning.  Trust me.

But you know what?  I got almost all of it out, except one major spot on the rug I will have to shampoo when everything thaws and warmer weather comes.

I will not soon live that one down!
