            When my wife and I decided to purchase a bigger home, we had two car payments. I told her that in order to afford the new house payment, one of the cars had to go and we had to purchase a "junker". She didn't like the idea at first and didn't want me driving anything undependable to work. I told her that I would do my best to find a dependable car under $3000. Well, ya'll, God is good! I found a 1995 Toyota Avalon with a rebuilt title from a salvage yard! Price tag . . .  $2200!! Yep , Two Thousand Two Hundred Dollars. Here's the kicker, it had 197,000 miles and had been rear ended very hard (so much the suspension arms were bent). I drove this puppy home and it STILL drove better than most cars I've owned in the past!! The long and short is, I spent about $1,000 to have it running in tip top shape by a shade tree mechanic.

OK, now for the breakdown (keep in mind this car has almost 200,000 miles!!!):

Ride: Very smooth, responsive steering, V6 provides more than adequate power (even in over drive).

Leg room: I'm 6'4" tall and if the driver's seat is all the way back I am really stretching to touch the steering wheel! Head room is absolutely no problem. Rear passengers have plenty of room even when the front seats are pushed fully back.

Gas mileage: 28 on the highway, 21 in town

Ammenities: XLS model has many nice features, including power moon roof, CD changer, climate control, power everything!

Some folks think I'm crazy for driving a rebuilt car, but I fully anticipate this car getting me another 100,000 miles. Just goes to show the quality Toyota puts in their cars!
