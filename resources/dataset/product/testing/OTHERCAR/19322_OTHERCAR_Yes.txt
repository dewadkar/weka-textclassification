            We purchased this camera to avoid carrying around our SLR! This camera has performed much better than we expected.  The color and quality of the pictures is outstanding. Even in dim light!  The software is even easy to use. And downloading the pictures via the USB cable is easy and fast.  A lot of our friends have other digital cameras, very expensive ones, and this camera matches them in quality. I wouldn't use this camera to replace a good SLR camera, but in addition to one, it is well worth it!

The battery life is o.k. if you aren't taking a ton of pictures. You can also use rechargeable batteries, so the cost of batteries doesn't need to get out of hand. On some of the digital cameras out there, they say you can use rechargeable batteries, but the company doesn't support the use of them!

The small 4MB memory card is a little disappointing, but it is easy and inexpensive to get an additional memory card. (We added a 32MB card and can take up to 100 pictures!)

I would recommend this camera to beginners. It is so easy to use. I had never used a digital camera before and I found it very easy to use. The display and picture taking modes are easy to access!

The only major problem we have had with this camera was trying to purchase it. We finally found a company that had it in stock! But, we had to try three others first.
