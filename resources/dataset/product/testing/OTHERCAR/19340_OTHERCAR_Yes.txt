            The 1990 Volvo 740 Turbo is a volvo in the truest sense; stodgy, comfy, safe, tank-like solidity, and of course, looknig like the box it came in.  But the optional turbo power transforms a slow, boxy luxury car into a quick, good handling touring luxury sedan.

When my brother got this car brand new in early 1990, it was the first volvo in my family.  It was certainly a different car.  Angular and bright red on the outside and dark black leather seats on the inside.  It stood out from the crowd here in southwestern pennsylvania.

After spending a few hours behind the wheel of this car off and on over the years, I notice that it is rather quick and agile.  The turbocharged and intercooled 4 cylender has alot of passing power, and after 175,000 miles of hard abuse and no time to cool down after the ride is over (you should always let your turbo car idle for a few seconds or more after a drive), the turbo has not had to been replaced/rebuilt yet.

Inside, the swedish wonder of a car is comfortable and roomy; the boxy exterior pays off here.  It is a great car for a long trip and a good family car.  The interior takes alot of abuse and shows no sings of wear after almost 12 years.

It's reliable as the sun and very tough.  It has never broke down, although replacement engine parts for normal maintnence and replacement body panels after wrecks cost quite a bit of money, and volvo service isn't the best.

After a decade with the volvo as my brother's daily driver and my occasional driver/rider, it has held up amazingly.  Your average chevrolet would be rusting in a junkyard by now under the abuse this family has given to this volvo, but the family's little swede still runs perfect and will easily last another 100,000 miles.
