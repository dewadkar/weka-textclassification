            The Chevy Lumina is a great car, DEPENDING on which motor you get, and your driving style. I have several friends and family members who have or still have Luminas, but they all have the 3.1 motor in them. Most of their cars have well over 100,000 miles and have had only minor problems. These cars also get around well in snow. 

When I saw a 1995 Lumina with only 60,000 miles, I did not hesitate to give it a good look-over and purchase it. The car had a 3.4 engine with DOHC and dual exhaust. It is a good, fast, and fun car, UNTIL you have to repair or have maintenance done to the engine. 

That is when this awesome car will give you awesome bills.
The timing belt has to be religiously changed every 60,000 miles to prevent engine damage if the belt would break. This will run you roughly $500 depending on where you live.
It has also developed $500 oil leaks.
It has an alternator that is Extremely Difficult to get to unless you remove half the engine.
I have seen it written that the 3.4 engine has to be pulled for most repairs and I would say that is accurate, to a point. If you do not pull the engine to repair it, you will have to remove half of it to get at what you are trying to work on.

Luminas are a pretty heavy car that require slightly more brake and transmission work, and slightly more expensive tires. But if you are looking for a good, dependable car get a Lumina. Just make sure it has the 3.1 engine.
