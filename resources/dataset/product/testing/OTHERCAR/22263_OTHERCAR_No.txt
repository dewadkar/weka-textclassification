            I purchased a Volvo V70 T5 about 30 days ago and I am sooooo down on the car.

A few background points
* This is my third Volvo
* I LOVE Volvos
* Have two kids and no worries with the awesome safety features

As the owner of a 1999 V70 T5 I am really let down by the 2001 V70 T5 for the following reasons......

1) Diminished field of vision over the 99 model.  When I learned to fly airplanes, I learned to appreciate the "field of vision" available to me as a pilot. In other words, how much can be seen from my regular seated position.  The same is true in cars. The change in body style from the 99 to 01 is great on the outside, but I dont like the blind spots created in the 01.  Im, not saying that you dont have good vision in the 01, its just FAR LESS than the 99.  My wife and I both have concerns with our ability to see cars behind and to the left of us when changing lanes. 

2) Less space for the back seat passengers.  The day I brought the car home, I pulled my sons car seat out of the 99 and put it in the 01.  I then adjusted my seat and almost twisted his ankle.  I dont own millions of dollars of CAD CAM equipment but I can tell you it doesnt work in my family.  

3) Less turbo pressure and pep.  This is not the same engine as the 99.  On the 99 you really feel the turbo kick in.  I asked the dealer to check the VIN number and car details to see if I had the right model, but it is. As I write this I am thinking of having the service department check for any problems with the turbo.
