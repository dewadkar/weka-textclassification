            I like the V6 much more than the V4 which only gives you 133 horse power. The camry V6 is definately one of the most quiet autos I have ever seen. Several times I went to reach the ignition key not noticing it is already at the &quot;on&quot; position. And when driving it is extremely smooth which is a big plus for being a great &quot;family car&quot;.

Now the pros and cons.

First the good stuff:

(1)Quiteness (much more quiet than Honda accord)
(2)Silky smooth (Auto transmision is so smooth comparing with the Accords. Extremely smooth ride)
(3)Economy in fuel
(4)V6 very powerful when going uphill, no problem at all to keep with the traffic.
(5)Very roomy and reliable.

Now the bad stuff:

(1)Looks boring: plain vanilla, very bland. Drowsy. Small windows comparing with Accords. Windows are eyes of a car, isn't it?
(2)Drives boring: Everything is overassisted, rides too soft and no road feel at all. And the scary part is the steering wheel which is too much overassisted that it feels very unsafe and unpredictable. Corners, corners, the behavior of this car at corners is troublesome. Too much body lean and uncomfortable. I used to make quick turns at 50MPH with my Honda, but I would never dare to try the same stunts on the camry. 
Overall handeling is not good at all. Driving a Honda makes you feel confident about your driving skills, driving a camry put you at the mercy of the car. This car is so boring to drive that sometimes you might go into sleep when driving which makes it very dangerous. This is not a &quot;fun&quot; car to drive. Period.
(3)The V4 lacks power comparing with Honda's offer. And the paint goes off pretty easily.

Overall it is a good &quot;family&quot; transportion tool. If you purchase the car for quietness, smoothness and reliability, you will love it. But if you are young or you want to have some serious fun while driving, stay away from this car.<br><br>
