            We bought this van after we took a few road trips with our 2 year old and realized we would need a separate trailer to take all his &quot;necessities.&quot; The fun stuff just wouldn't fit in our Corolla's trunk space.

We love the room and the adjustablity of the rear seating.  Our second row captains chairs come out completely and the far rear bench slides into the second row seating area for lots of additional space in the back. We also love that it feels like it has power and has been very reliable where the engine and other major systems are concerned (except one - see below)

It is a pain, however, to get my son in and out of his carseat because their is only one sliding rear door. We bought this van in May '99 with 85k miles on it and as of now (20k miles later) we've spent about $1200 on brakes, stablizers, tires, a/c, and exhaust problems. But haven't touched the tip of the iceberg...

We consulted Consumer Reports before we bought this van and for our year the electrical system was rated poor and now we know why.  Within 1000 miles after purchase, our rear a/c controls went kaput, the van decides to lock whenever it feels like it, our windshield wash works sometimes as do our antennae and radio. Recently; our blinkers have decided to blink once and stay on.  The problem is that it could cost thousands to fix with no guarantee it would even work or last.    <br><br>
