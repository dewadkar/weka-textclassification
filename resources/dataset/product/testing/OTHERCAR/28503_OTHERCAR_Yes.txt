            I purchased a used Saab 900s sedan a year ago.  The model-line has since been renamed to 9-3, but, although there are a large number of modifications between the two cars, they appear nearly identical.  The model that I own is what would be called a stripper, I suppose.  However, the quality of the Saab has been truly impressive.  I have the 2.3l regularly-aspirated model, which I believe has been since dropped from the line-up.  It is a very capable engine, and, having driven newer models with the more powerful turbo power-plants, I can say that Saabs are quite adept when it comes to performance.

My Saab has the &quot;simple&quot; fabric seats.  My next vehicle will probably have leather - but not by my choice.  If you can find a Saab with the fabric seats, give it a try.  They are incredibly comfortable, the fabric is of exceptional quality, and the overall experience is very nice.

Also of particular note is the terrific factory sound system.  As a rather choosy audiophile, I fully intended on replacing the sound system soon after purchasing the car.  I have since decided that the stock system is simply too good to justify the upgrade.

Another particularly nice feature with the 900/9-3 series is the great storage capacity.  With the rear seats folded forwards, the capacity makes those small SUVs seem unnecessary.  I do wish, however, that the rear seats could be folded flat without having to pull the front seats forward.  But, for the few times that I need the hauling capacity, it isn't much of a sacrifice.

I would encourage anyone out looking at entry-level luxury autos to check out the Saabs.  They are wonderful in terms of performance, build quality, and ergonomic design...and just writing this has made me reconsider trading in my Saab for a new BMW...  =)<br><br>
