            I fell in love with this car the first time I drove it. It handled well, was comfortable to sit in, accelerated well, and looked sharp. I love the shape, the styling and the added features on the used model I purchased, especially the CD player, the electric seat adjustment, and all the little gauges/readouts that were obvious extras. I've only had one problem with it: the brakes &quot;stick&quot; at times, and even though I've had it to 2 different dealers, they've never been able to diagnose the problem. Other than that, this is a great car. Nice for families, lots of trunk space for travelling; comfortable enough for an older couple or business person.<br><br>
