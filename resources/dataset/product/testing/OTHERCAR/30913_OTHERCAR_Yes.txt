            After the death of my cheap $50 ebay purchased polaroid digital camera, I was determined to get another digital camera with a shoe string budget of about $100.

One day while surfing the net I found this camera going for $99 (after rebates) at my local compUSA store and rushed down and bought it.

Not expecting much for $99, I was pleased that this digital camera could take pictures up to 1.3 mega pixels and even have an LCD screen! The SC-1300 even comes with many other nifty features such as 2x digital zoom, 8mb flash card (supports up to a 32mb flash card), 3 selectible image quality settings, 3 flash modes, removable flash memory and other cool features that I've forgotten about. Check out www.sipix.com for full details of this camera.

Picture quality of this camera is great and pictures appear sharp. With the supplied 8mb removable flash card I can take up to 89 pictures at the low quality setting of 640x480 resolution. I find that this resolution is good enough for just sending photos to my friends and parents.

The downfall of this digital camera is that it is HUGE compared to its slightly more expensive competitors (Eg: HP, Fuji). My friend even mistook the SC-1300 for a digital VIDEO camera and commented that "shouldn't a digital camera be smaller?" For $99 I can't complain much and I'm not so troubled that my camera looks large and bulky. At least it's not in a garish colour! 

Another downfall of this camera is that it uses a lot of battery power. After about maybe 30 photos with flash I had to change the 4AA batteries. Perhaps I shouldn't have left the LCD screen on for too long... Try to use long lasting batteries for this camera or rechargeable batteries.

On the whole for the price I'm very pleased with this camera. If you have a low budget this camera is for you. But whether or not this camera would last I'm not so sure. I don't really trust this no-name brand. If you purchase it from a retail store perhaps you might want to pay extra for an extended warranty plan (I did), it won't be nice if your camera failed on you after a month. If that makes you uneasy then I suggest you cough out a bit more and get a branded digital camera. 

Hope this review helped.
