            <b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS:</b>
I saw this car out on the market for the first time in a Hammacher Schlemmer Christmas catalog... yes, a mail-order catalog!  I found this car to be very sporty with a touch of elegance.  The base engine isn't as powerful as some of its other German friends, but it suits the package just fine.  For such an exotic car, I thought the MSRP would be over-inflated, but it hovered around $32,000...if you could get your hands on one!

<b><i>BUBBLY</i>, DON'T YOU THINK?</b>
Well, it took a little while to get used to, but I found the roundness and smoothness to be very attractive.  The 'oh-so-luscious' silver coat it wears so proudly makes me wonder what other colors it would look fashionable with.  I've seen many on the road here in Oregon including a white, dark blue, black, and a platinum color.  

Every detail on the TT is worked out like a fine piece of art.  The fuel cap is brushed chrome and sits on the rear hump.  It gives the TT a little personality and also gives the owner something to polish every once in a while.

<b>ERGONOMICS:</b> 
Once you get in the seat of the TT, you'll know right away that Audi designed this machine to be a driver's best friend.  The instrument cluster is surrounded with chrome accents and aluminum overlays.  At first-sight, you'll be a little overwhelmed with all the gadgets, but after driving it for a few minutes, everything becomes second-hand.  At night you're welcomed by orangish-red lighting on the dash and stereo.  I'm so used to the bluish light in my Passat that the orangish light threw me off at first.  Driving on dark roads is not a problem with the TT because it comes equipped with the HID (High-Intensity Discharge) lighting system.  The leather-wrapped steering wheel begs to be grabbed with both hands.  It took me a few seconds to find the stereo nicely hidden behind an aluminum panel.  Just flip the panel up and you're invited to some sweet tunes.  

The leather seats are very supple and conforms to your posture, while the headrests are easily adjustable.  The shift knob is very comfortable to the touch, but it would have been nicer if the throw was positioned closer between each gear (nothing that after-market parts can't do).  The rear seats aren't designed for adults.  I'd say it's perfect for your little ones or for groceries!  When they're not in use, you can fold them down so you can haul your gear.  It's very useful since the TT is a hatchback.

Other options such as a 6-disc CD changer, 17&quot; alloy wheels, and if you're interested, there's also the beefed-up 1.8 liter that pumps out 225 horses with 207 ft.-lbs. of torque. 

<b>THE FUN BEGINS...</b>
Ben, my good college buddy, owns a TT.  After his promotion at his new job last year, he decided that he deserved a TT.  He took me out to lunch last week and let me take it out for a spin.  First of all, you get looks from basically everyone.  Second, you become amazed with the quick response of the throttle and wheel.  The ride is very smooth, yet you feel the road enough to know what the car is capable of under your control.  The overall flavor of the interior is similar (minus the aluminum accents and design) to my Passat.  

Although it lacked the typical sports car '<i>umph</i>' at the starting line, it packed a punch at higher gears.  Dropping it to 3rd gear from 5th gave me plenty of power to pass traffic already going 60+ MPH.  If I had this TT all to myself without Ben sitting next to me (worrying if I was ever going to take it easy on his baby), I would have enjoyed taking it to the beach to test it out on highway 101.  I really wanted to know what this TT was capable of, but I felt sorry for Ben because he was biting his nails the whole time (he always bites his nails when he's either worried or nervous).

On the city streets, it behaves itself and gets great gas mileage.  Parking the TT is fairly easy, but it has a wicked blind-spot near the rear pillar.               

<b>PROBLEMS SO FAR:</b>
My friend's had his TT for about a year now and he's racked up around 19K miles.  He loves it due to the fact that it's a rare car here in Oregon.  The only downfall to his ownership is that he lives about 100 miles away from the nearest Audi dealership.  For all of his factory maintenance, he has to drive up to Portland.  Although, Audi carries a <b>3-year/50K mile warranty</b>, it's a pain in the butt to have to drive an hour and a half to get things fixed.  

The only problems that Ben's had on his TT is the HID lighting system going out during the second month of ownership.  He had to get it towed from Corvallis to Portland (about 90 miles) to get it fixed.  Audi gave him a loaner car (Audi A4 1.8T) for a week.  His intermittent wiper went out after six months, and again, he had to take it up to Portland to get it fixed (a four-hour wait).  Other than that, he's enjoyed every bit of his TT and is telling me to get one, too... I'll have to negotiate with the wife...

<b>ABILITY TO UPGRADE:</b>
If you're into speed, the TT may be your ticket to the fast track.  Although the base TT only comes with 180 horses, it is an open book for aftermarket specialists.  <i>Chipping</i> (replacing the main CPU of the car with another) the TT with a Neuspeed performance chip, fitting it with a better intake system, replacing the stock turbo unit with a K04 unit, adding a high-performance exhaust, and upgrading the suspension will dramatically increase the sportiness of the TT by a huge margin.  An increase of another 180 horsepower is common with the TT.  

With all due respect, I feel that the TT is perfectly fine the way it comes.  I feel that all it lacks is a little power from the start, but it's plenty enough for the long haul ahead.  It's nice to know that there are lots aftermarket parts that are available for the TT just in case you get the urge to break the speed of sound.

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
After getting the attention of a handful of people at many auto shows around the world when it was introduced as a concept car, the Audi TT is available to all.  Many think it looks like a silly space probe while others would do just about anything to get their hands on one.  I think that Audi has something good going here.  The TT will be the topic of many auto conversations for years to come.
