            My office just purchased one of these cameras last week and we still haven't gotten finished oohing and ahhing over it.  It is so chock full of features that we have yet to use them all, and we play...I mean work...with this thing daily.

Like most Sony Digital cameras, it features an LCD screen on the back of the camera.  This is used to preview the pictures you shoot.  It also has a viewfinder that is only one when you put your eye up to it, so it actually detects that you are looking through it.  How cool is that?  

Also standard to Sony digitals is the built-in diskette drive for storing the photos and video.  In addition to standard floppies, you can buy an adapter that fits into the floppy drive and allows you to use memory sticks for storing even more pictures and video.

The average 640x480 picture taken by this camera is about 37k and looks great.  The 1600x1280 pics are roughly 350k and look perfect!  This is an excellent camera for taking and printing pictures on photo-quality paper and framing.  It's 2.1 megapixels, and you need at least 2.0 megapixels to properly print 8.5x11 size paper pictures.  This gives you just a little extra for your money.

It's a little heavy, and not really a small camera, so you wouldn't want to lug this thing around a theme park all day.  Then again, maybe you would just because you'd get the respect of other techies and photographers in the park.

The Sony DigiMavica FD-95 is very easy to use and takes excellent quality pictures.  I recommend you buy the diskette adapter and memory sticks in order to store more and larger pictures.<br><br>
