            I purchased a white demo Vigor GS (10K miles) in July of '93. I was looking for something that was reliable (I had a '90 Blazer, enough said), not very common (eliminates Camrys and Accords) and was fun to drive. My brother also had a '92 Vigor which he loved and subsequently sold to my parents. I paid $24,000 out-the-door and it has been worth every penny of it. I was single at the time and didn't have a need for a lot of room. Now seven years later with a wife and two children, I must say it's getting a little cramped. As mentioned in other posts, rear seat space is this car's major, but basically, only flaw.

Also as is mentioned before, maintenance and repairs tend to be expensive, but fortunately this car hardly ever breaks. I cracked the left rear taillight when I forgot I put out the garbage and backed into the garbage can. Dealer quoted me over $400 for the part. I work for a major insurance company and was able to find a used one from a salvage yard that we deal with who had a wrecked Vigor. They still charged me $350.00. Rarity has it's price. Warranty work was limited to mostly cosmetic stuff and a problem with the alarm going off when unlocking the door (Acura issued a bulletin on this). In addition, during the past seven years, aside from muffler, brakes, tires and timing belt replacement, the only major repair was a right front wheel bearing that went bad at around 70,000 miles. It came gradually by way of a humming noise. No vibrations, no steering wheel shimmy, just a steady hum. At first I thought it was the tires (which it needed), but after purchasing the new tires the noise was still there. I was told by the dealer that they can go bad if you hit a pothole hard - I don't remember so I'll take their word on it. The water pump started leaking at around 88k miles which is normally replaced when replacing the timing belt anyway. 

Timing belt and water pump replacement: $500.00 (primarily for labor)
Included replacing timing belt, all drive belts, water pump and coolant flush

Wheel Bearing replacement: $400.00 (primarily for the cost of parts)
Included wheel bearing and hub

After a friend of mine purchased a new TL last year, I was tempted to trade mine in also. Although when driving his TL I didn't notice much of a difference in ride quality with my 80K mile Vigor. Acceleration and gadgets are another story though. The dealer offered me a decent price on the trade, but they weren't budging on the TL. They were selling at sticker with a three month waiting list. I changed my mind and figured I would drive this car into the ground. At this rate, it looks as though it could take another seven years. The dealer tells me that they regularly see Acuras with 170K to 180K miles come in for minor service. As a matter of fact while I was having the wheel bearing replaced on mine, I saw a '94 Legend in there with 250K miles and  showed no hint of it's age or mileage. 

At 100K miles, this car still runs the way it did when I drove it off the dealer lot in July '93 and I enjoy driving it just as much. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this is a driver's car, as most Honda products are. At a stop light, if you stomp on it (which I rarely do), it'll still squeal the tires. It still looks great (although I treat my car better than most people treat their pets, and everything still works. The stereo is awesome and I've had no problems with it, or the CD changer and the A/C still blows cold enough that you can see your breath. Some posts here mentioned a problem with the display on the radio. My parents had the same problem with their '92 Vigor GS (only 50k miles) two years ago. Called the dealer to inquire about the cost of repairing the radio and at first they offered to replace it, even though the warranty had expired three years earlier! ('92 Acuras had a 3yr/36K mile warranty vs. 5yr/50K in '93) Unfortunately they couldn't find a new unit so they offered to pay for the repair of the existing unit if we would pay the labor to remove and reinstall it ($60 at that time). Again, remember it was three years out of warranty. Try that with another manufacturer outside of Honda or Toyota. It seems as though Acura issued a bulletin on these stereos regarding problems with the displays. Hence a different unit was installed in the '94s. The dealer told me that a replacement unit listed for close to $1,000. If I were paying I would then go to an aftermarket stereo. 

Based on my own experience, customer service is outstanding. Usually I do my own maintenance, but when I do take in in for an oil change or other rare work, I'm treated just as well as a customer who brought in his new $45K 3.5RL. The work is always done right the first time and the car is returned to me detailed, all for a $22 oil change. See if you get that at Jiffy Lube. 

It's as reliable as a hammer and the styling doesn't look dated after seven years. Honda is often criticized for less than aggressive styling, but maybe that's why they still look good after many years. The leather hasn't cracked after all these years, although I regularly apply a conditioner. No squeaks, rattles or fluid leaks. Highway ride is very quiet, all you hear is the distant hum of the engine and a faint gear whine from the transmission. All very normal, you just don't hear gear whine on other cars because of wind, tire, engine or other noise. I have noticed the lights behind the vent control buttons don't always go on when turning on my headlights. If I tap on the dash with my finger, it'll come back on. Must be a loose connection. The problem is intermittent and extremely minor.

While the acceleration won't set your hair on fire, it'll hold it's own and the handling is excellent. I am a lead foot and have gotten this car into triple digit speeds many times, which it will do without protest. The fastest was 125 mph on a lonely stretch of highway while driving to  downstate Illinois. It was still pulling, but for fear of being arrested for felony speeding, I eventually backed off. At that speed, the car was stable without the slightest bit of vibration. I think I read somewhere that this car is electronically limited to 130 mph because of the &quot;H&quot; rated tires it comes with.

Consumer Reports has rated the '92 as one of the most reliable used cars and MicroSoft Carpoint has rated reliability for '92-'94 Vigors as &quot;Best in Class&quot;. 

As you can see by my lengthy post, I love this car and would definitely buy another Honda/Acura product. If you're looking for one, good luck! If you found one, congratulations! I know you won't be disappointed.
