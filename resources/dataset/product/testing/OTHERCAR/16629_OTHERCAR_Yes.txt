            I bought my 2001 Accent GS last night.  I really wanted an automatic with A/C.  I also only wanted the beige interior so that left me with green, white, and desert sand as exterior colors.  So I had put my order in for a desert sand color GS 3 weeks ago and here I am with the color and options I wanted at a price that couldn't be beat!
    The car is absolutely great with the 1.6L engine (this comes standard in the GS and GL)  It is much more peppier that the 1.5L.  It is also quieter and more refined.  Everything in the car is placed to be reached very easily. I am very picky when it comes to cars, so I had reviewed and researched this car for a long time.  When I heard they came out with a 105HP engine, I jumped at it!.  I recommend this car to anyone who needs a GREAT car for a very inexpensive price.  Hyundai's have come along way in rebuilding their reputation and I have complete trust in them with this &quot;new&quot; Accent!
