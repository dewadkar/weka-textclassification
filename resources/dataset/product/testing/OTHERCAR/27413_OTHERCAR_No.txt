            A couple years ago I purchased a 1995 Dodge Neon.  At the time I thought the car was very stylish and had great character.  How was I to know that it would have SO MANY problems.  I even test drove the car.  And it ran fine.  The list of problems started from the date of purchase.  The car stops running 3 hours after purchase because the gas gauge stated 1/4 tank but it is out of gas.   Two weeks later on a road trip to L.A., the car started smoking in Anaheim, and stopped running.  The throdle body shorts out and causes a fuel leek, and shorts the alternater.  Back in the shop again.  Basically for the first year of ownership, I had rental cars and temporary cars MORE than I had the car I was paying for.

Also, on the list of problems, the muffler has poor ankers and rattles.  The Transmission is an automatic but goes from first gear to second to neutral for the first 5 miles you drive the car.  I do NOT recommend you buy this car.  If you do.  Don't EVEN buy used.  That is just asking for trouble.  They may look great but as the cliche goes, &quot;Don't judge a book by is cover.&quot;<br><br>
