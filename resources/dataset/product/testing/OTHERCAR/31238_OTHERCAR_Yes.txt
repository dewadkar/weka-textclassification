            I have owned this car 8 years and it now has 130,000 miles on it, yet it still looks and runs great.  I bought it with 20,000 miles from a dealer in 1996.  It is a 4-door 3.1L V6.  At purchase, I was informed by the dealer mechanic that the V6 is the way to go for reliability and ease of repairs vs. the quad4.  I have found this advice to be true given my experiences and those of others (and if you read other reviews, you&#146ll find problems tend to be with the quad4).

Reliability:
I have had no serious problems with this car, though it is important to note that I take care of my vehicle&#151I change oil every 3-4k miles and I am generally not hard on the engine (I don&#146t floor it at every green light). The transmission has a very slow leak&#151I simply off the fluid every 3k miles if needed.  I had all hoses replaced (one was leaking) at about 80k, and a tune up around 100k.  The only complaint I have is the rotors tend to warp easily with heavy braking.  I&#146ve needed to have the rotors turned at least once a year, and replaced them a year or so ago.  I also had new shocks/struts put on at 100k (one of the shocks was making noise on bumps), though it still rides rough compared to newer models.

Performance:
The V6 is respectable.  If you punch it, it will get up and go.  You can easily squeal your front tires taking off from a stop if you want to.  The mileage I have had is 27-29.  Much of my driving is hwy.  I have hit 30mpg, but it is never less than 25.  It seems to handle well in winter, and the anti-lock brakes have saved me a few times.  As I said earlier, the ride is rougher than I like, but this isn&#146t a Cadillac&#151you get what you pay for.

Misc:
The interior is roomy up front.  The trunk could hold most of my belongings when I was in college.  The rear doors open very wide (almost 90 degrees, which helps in loading big items).  My passengers tell me the seats are some of the most comfortable they&#146ve sat in.  The exterior is sharp and sporty.  The plastic panels on the doors have held up fine, and I have no rust, though I wax my car semi-annually & try to keep it clean in winter.

Negatives:
Squeaks and rattles in the interior.  Especially with the heat and cold of the Midwest, the dash always seems to rattle in a different spot depending on the weather.  This can drive you nuts on a long trip.  As mentioned earlier, the brake rotors warp easily, and the ride could be better.

Overall it is a very good car if you take care of it.  If you are going to buy one, be sure to get a V6 and ask for any maintenance records.
