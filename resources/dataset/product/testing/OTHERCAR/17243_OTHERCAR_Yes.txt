            My husband and I wanted a luxury car for sometime but thought we could never afford it!  We started shopping around the smart way and to our surprise we were wrong!  We found a 1992 Lexus ES300 for an awesome price (way under blue book!).  The previous owner had the car since it was brand new, and it was in incredible condition.  It was love at first sight!  The body style has not changed in years. Everyone thinks it is a lot newer then it is. The seats are a beautiful tan leather, and the outside a rich deep burgundy. This car has every feature and then some. The mileage was even below 60,000. This car is a quality product.  It drives like you are in the air, it is so smooth. We are very happy with our purchase.  And are looking forward to our next Lexus purchase...the Lexus SUV! <br><br>
