            I bought my 2000 cirrus lx because my wife and I were looking for a car with ample interior space, good acceleration, luxury and above all, good value.  I absolutely love this car because it fits all of the above criteria and more.  I purchased this vehicle for under $18,000 and it included such items as power everything, keyless entry, auto transmission, air-conditioning and the 2.4 liter engine upgrade.
     This car is a pleasure to drive.  It handles great with a tight steering ratio but at the same time has a luxury &quot;feel&quot; to it.  I am surprised at how responsive the 2.4 liter L-4 engine is.  The first time I test-drove the car, I thought the car was equipped with the 6-cylinder option because it has very quick acceleration!  This car has better response than other vehicle makes that I test drove equipped with larger engines.  Moreover, this car stands out of the crowd in the usual boring mid-sized market.  It has style and I have been complimented on how &quot;awesome&quot; and &quot;pretty&quot; my car is.  As a matter of fact, others are in awe of how little I paid for it.  This is an all-around great car and I honestly can't think of anything that I hate about it.  This car is for the individual who likes luxury, performance and value included in one package.  Hat's off to Chrysler!
