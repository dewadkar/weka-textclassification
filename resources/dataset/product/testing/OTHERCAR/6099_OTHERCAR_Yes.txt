            For the person who desires a comfortable driving car the Chevrolet Impala is a class act.  The handling in nearly every driving situation is far superior to cars I have driven.  The ride gives you a sense of durability without the high cost of one of those foreign numbers that costs an arm and a leg.

Driving an Impala is a real joy from the time you seat yourself behind the wheel and ease into any type of traffic.  Response of the engine is quick, quiet and powerful.

When equipped with leather upholstery the car is ideal for my driving needs.  The only problem with the Chevrolet Impala is the standard cloth upholstery which makes getting into and out of the car rather a sticky situation but this is true with any and all manufactures who sell a fabric upholstered automobile.

For the man, woman or family car the Chevrolet Impala is a very good car that will serve its owner well for many comfortable miles.  Anyone who enjoys a nice looking car, built for comfort and style will enjoy the pride of owning one of these cars that General Motors has spent many thoughtful hours in perfecting.

The only person who should not buy a Chevrolet Impala is those who feel that they should spend in excess of $60,000 to impress others or to pump up the ego by spending way too much to get from point A to point B.

If you are looking for a good car with great looks at a price anyone can afford with an economic maintenance service history....then you should buy a 2000 Chevrolet Impala. That is my next car. <br><br>
