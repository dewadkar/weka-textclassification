            I don't know why all cars are not built like this one. The Buick Century is apparently built on GM's primary platform (read: It does not get any better in quality from GM.). It shows.

You may or may not have heard about the awards that the Century has received for best initial quality, but test drive this thing. Seriously, roll over Camry and Accord!

This is the smoothest ride in its class, the most comfortable seats that there are in this class, it accelerates with great speed and a satisfying roar, it is supremely reliable, and guess what? I'm buying another as our second car.

Now, a little you might wan to know about me: I am a 30-something year old professional, I live in a big city, and I visit family frequently who live 300  miles away. I have back problems, and I am no drag racer, but I like a little speed once in a while.

This is the one. 175 horsepower is more than adequate for all your acceleration needs, or why are you here? go look at the pretty corvettes (or check out the 240 hp Buick Regal GS). Seat comfort is unbeatable, room is great, contols are handy, design is a dignified, respectable, creative and stylish for a sedan (or go look at the pretty corvettes again).

Reliability is 100% at 76,000 miles with nothing more than regular maintenance, no repairs to date (September 2003).

Get all the bang for your buck. I paid 6500 for this car in 2002. I am going to get another one, too.

Sedans, this is the one to beat. Thanks, Buick.
