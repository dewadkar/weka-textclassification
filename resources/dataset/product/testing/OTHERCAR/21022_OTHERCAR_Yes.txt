            This is the most incredible little camera. Please excuse me for I am not a very technological type of person, but when I first started to use this camera I really fell in love with it. The pictures come out so crystal clear and life like. I had never used or even knew of seeing pics taken with a digital camera, so it was all very new to me. I was like a little child in a candy store. 

I did shop around for cheaper and even more expensive models but by the time I left the store I was very pleased with my choice. The gentlemen at the store did help a bunch seeings how I had no idea what pixel meant, lol...

My favorite feature of all is the fact that u can view the pics right away and not like a polaroid, lol.. All you do is change the little button on top to view the pic u last took and then u can flip thru everyone on your memory card. Not to mention doing the same on your PC or TV. I have a big screen TV also made by Sony and it looks fabulous on it, except for the ones of me, lol 

There are so many wonderful features I do not know where to begin. It comes with a charger that all you do is plug it into the wall and the other end into the camera and it charges in no time at all. It also came with a cord to attach to your PC and another that attaches to your television. There are 5 settings from 2048x1536 for the best quality all the way down to 640x480 for just posting them on the net or emailing to a friend. Although using the high quality 2048x1536 gives you much less room on your memory card the pictures turn out incredible, but at the same time the lower qualities turn out just fine themselves.

]When the battery is fully charged you get about 60 minutes of picture taking fun and about45 pics to take depending on the quality you want of course. My camera also has MPEG MOVIE EX where you can make a short movie, the quality is rather poor but it is a nice feature to use at times. It also has sound which is a great feature. 

SPo far I have taken probably 500 pics with this camera which would cost me a fortune to have developed and since I do not care to keep all of the pics I can easily delete them as I go along or when I review them when I return from a trip or a day on the golf course. I love to keep a Golfing buddy of mine up to date on the new courses I play so I bring it along and snap a few just for him, then I email them to him and delete, badabing badabang, lol 

Its just so easy to use, even for a knuckle head like myself. I have taken pictures of the sun setting, the sun rising, kids in the park, the ocean,baseball games etc... The one thing I do not like is most of your pics have to be somewhat still to get a good pic, I learned that at a Padre's baseball game, lol I tried to get a few in motion pics of players running etc, and none of them turned out just a blur and a hat, lol Other then that it is a wonderful piece of machinery. It also comes with a guide on how to use it, of course me being male I just flipped thru it and read more when problems occurred, but I would highly suggest reading the entire manual before using.

I suggest doing just as I did, especially if you are not very hip on all of the terms they use for digital cameras. Go to the Good Guys who are extremely helpful and just try them all out. You do tend to get what you pay for so I would not suggest anything to cheap unless that is what you are looking for. Good luck and Happy picture taking....

P.S. for any of you non internet junkies "lol" means laughing out loud.
