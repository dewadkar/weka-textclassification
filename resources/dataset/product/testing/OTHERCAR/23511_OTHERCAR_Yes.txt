            I recently had the opportunity to test drive two great cars: the BMW M3 and the Audi S4.  Contrary to my expectations, it was the Audi, not the BMW that blew me away.

The S4 has everything you want in an automobile.  It has great styling an excellent interior, a powerful engine and the best handling you've ever experienced.  This car made me a beliver in all wheel drive.  You can not break it loose; it feels like it's riding on rails.  The engine is very smooth and is well mated to the six speed manual transmission (an automatic could never do justice to this car).  The S4 is fast, not as fast as a Mustang Cobra, but coming in around 6 sec from 0 to 60.

The interior is stylish and refined.  The only complaint would be the small back seat.  But then again, if you buy the car you wont be sitting back there.

I recommend this car to anyone looking for a luxury sport sedan.<br><br>
