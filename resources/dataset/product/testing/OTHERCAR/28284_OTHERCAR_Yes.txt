            I was sold on the Durango during my very first test drive. However, I had decided up front that I would shop around for the SUV that offered everything I was looking for, style, comfort and performance. I kept going back to the Durango with the 360 V8, what a magnificent vehicle.

The great styling attracts attention wherever I go, the ride is very comfortable, even on long trips, and the Durango handles almost like a sports car. Unlike the larger SUV's on the market, the Durango is easy to drive, very easy to park and has great acceleration. 

The only down side I have found is the fuel mileage. However, there are a few after-market performance products you can purchase, which improve fuel mileage considerably. I have found the K&amp;N Air Filter System offers the most improvement for the money.

My previous vehicle was a full size Chevy pickup with the third door. The back seat in the Chevy was suitable for small children and groceries, that's about all. The Durango provides a comfortable ride for six passengers, and I still have room for groceries behind the third seat.

In my opinion, there is no other SUV in it's class that even comes close to the Durango. If you're shopping for the perfect SUV I strongly recommend that you test drive the Durango. It doesn't matter if you drive it first or last...just drive it... and you'll see what I mean.
