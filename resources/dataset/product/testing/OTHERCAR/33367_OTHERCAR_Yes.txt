            I was driving a 1991 Crown Victoria police package seventy miles a day when I figured out that gasoline was going to kill me, and trying to keep the thing on the road cost more then it was worth.  Time to get a new car.

I figured that I'd base the decision on cost, with anything under $20,000 a possibility.  I had owned a Honda before the Ford, so I figured that the Civic would be an option, but I had seen several ads for the Jetta and decided to take a look at that, too.  The first and only test drive was the VW.

Compared to the competition, you get a lot more for the money with the Jetta.  I got the GLS with the luxury package, which includes power everything, sunroof, AC, cruise control, heated side mirrors, alloy wheels, the Monsoon sound system, and an armrest.  Even the basic Jetta comes with four wheel disk brakes and side impact airbags, AC, and a host of other features.  The big selling point for me was the VW had even thought to wrap stainless steel around the inside of the trunk to keep one from damaging the lip of the trunk while inserting items.

I did stop off at the Honda dealer to look at the new Civics, but the difference in cost couldn't justify what I wasn't going to get.

The few complaints that I can make after 1400 miles are minor.  The &quot;resume&quot; setting on the cruise control is awkward for those of us used to the American standard.  Volkswagen has the driver pull the switch toward the end of the turn signal instead of pushing it toward the steering column.  The radio controls are difficult to operate with a cup in the cup holder, and the hold down clips for the floor mats tend to break, according to the salesman.  Finally, if you have the Monsoon sound system, its going to be tough to get a multi-disk changer for the car.  I wanted to take the Blaupunkt system that I have in the old car and hook it up to the Monsoon head unit, but its not going to work.

I'd say that this is definitely a car to look at when shopping around
