            I bought a 1998 Dodge Intrepid ES because I needed to get rid of my 2-door Pontiac that no longer made it easy to get my growing 2-year-old into the back seat. I admit that I liked the look of the Intrepid, and it already qualified as a big 4-door car that was within my budget: NEVER buy a car for which the purchase price is greater than 50% of your annual income. That's always been my standard and the Intrepid met it. My car has just about every option Dodge offers on an Intrepid ES except a sunroof. No sunroof means more headroom in the car.

The Intrepid is great. It's roomy, comfortable, and quiet. The trunk is enormous - I just wish that when the back seats fold down that they would fold flat, but you can't have everything. The engine is quite powerful enough for my needs in passing cars and using on-ramps. This is the first car that I have driven with anti-lock breaks and my first few experiences with anti-lock breaks were surprising, so thankfully I knew what to do when I felt that rumble under the pedal. More surprising was the low growling sound I heard when the anti-lock system kicked in. Worked just like it was supposed to work. This car has the Auto-Stick (or Auto-Shift), so that you can shift the transmission manually if you like. I tried it a few times and it does work, but it's mainly a gimmick because I really don't use it. This car has so much power that I have unintentionally peeled out of an intersection a few times.

Everything in this car is easy to use. I was hesitant to buy this car because it was a brand new model - the car itself sold me anyway. I learned that this was the first car to ever be totally designed and tested through computer simulation before the first mock-up was ever made. Seems that Chrysler definitely wanted a modern car, and I believe they got it.

My gas mileage in town is about 16 mpg, which I attribute to driving to work and back home a total of 3 miles/day. When I take a trip on the Interstate and drive at about 65-70 mph, my gas mileage goes up to about 30-32 mpg - big difference. The recent gas hikes have not made an impact on my fuel bill for the car because I only fill the tank about once every 2 weeks.

This car is very easy to drive. It did take a while for me to become accustomed to its length, or at least my impression of its length since it can be difficult to see either end of the car while you are driving - the nose dips down and the rear window is high.

I really like this car. The only problem that I had with this car is that I had to go into the shop at least 7 times to get my electric windows fixed. I had problems with different windows failing to come down at various times. It wasn't until my 4th trip in that Chrysler discovered that the alarm system was causing the problems with the windows as well as the problems with the horn (which failed twice). It took 3 more visits after that because each time Chrysler thought they had a solution for the alarm system problem, only to revise their solution a few weeks later. Nevertheless, I finally have a complete set of working windows, horn and car alarm. The alarm/window/horn problem has been the ONLY repair problem that I have had with my car. Everything else has worked as expected.

This is a very nice car for the price and just about anyone would be able to use this car.
