            BACKGROUND:
 I had a 1999 ZR2, 2-door blazer previous to this.  It didnt have 4 doors, and I destroyed the interior (beach sand, spilled laundry detergent, etc.) hauling things around.  So I was looking for a truck with 4 doors and a truck bed.  I use it as my daily driver to work (office job) and most of the time, the truck is not loaded.  The review is based on using the truck this way, only at times used to actually haul things.

POWER:
  My dakota has a 4.7, automatic with a locking rear diff.  I am very impressed by the power.  I was thinking about going with a 5.9, and I am glad that I didnt because it has plenty of power.  0-60 is very fast, and the rear anti-spin diff really helps it shoot off the line.  On the highway, it purrs at 70 at about 2100 rpms (3.55 rear end).  After test driving both the 270 horse trailblazer and the silverado, the 4.7 Dakota seems to have a better power balance.

COMFORT:
  The front seats are nice.  I got the bucket seats with the console.  The console is really terrific.  It beats chevy's versions by far.  The back seats are fixed to the rear wall of the cab.  This makes the back of the seat very straight.  For short trips, its fine.  But for a 2+hour trip, it will get uncomfortable.  
  The gauges and warning lights are good.  The placement of the stereo and heat/air buttons are nice as well.  One thing that drives me crazy is that the steering wheel column is so big, that I feel like it crowds my right leg.  

HANDLING/RIDE:
  The ride is really good - comparing it to the trailblazer I test-drove and my old blazer.  If you're used to a lincoln, you may be disappointed.  But my wife and coworkers feel that the ride is an improvement.  As with all trucks, you have to be cautious on wet roads when you're turning.  Other than that, when its dry, it takes the sharp LI parkway ramps in stride.
  I think that the steering wheel seems a little too small for the amount of turning involved.  The turning radius is very sharp.  I suggest you test-drive this vehicle to see if you like the handling.  Its tight and fun to drive, but in sharp turns, it feels like you have to move the wheel a lot.

SOUND:
  I have a 6-disc changer, which is a MOPAR add-on.  Overall, it is a good system.  Comparing it to my blazers stereo, it isnt as good.  Even my wife commented on it.  The sound quality is just ok, and it doesnt have speed-compensated volume, which is a great feature.  I did not get the 6-speaker option.  You may want to think about it if you really want a nice sound system.  

APPEARANCE:
    I like the way it looks.  But you have to like pickups.
I got mine in silver and it hides dirt nicely.  The interior is graphite up to the window level, and the headliner is a tan color.  I think it makes it appear roomier.

MISC CONS:
 The small bed doesnt make it easy to get plywood or 8' lengths of materials without some planning on how to keep it in the bed.  My mountain bike just barely fits when I take the front tire off.  
 The keyless entry is a little outdated compared to other models.  Your choices are it beeps all the time, or never beeps.  I liked the once - silent, twice - chirp to verify doors locked. 
 I test drove the silverado and I really liked that truck.  The cons were that the back seat was 50% more uncomfortable than my Dakota, and the 1/2 ton truck was just too big.  At times, even the Dakota's length makes it a nuisance to park in small lots.
