            I desperately wanted a mini van since we have a family of 5.  It was getting a bit too crowded getting everyone and their stuff into our sedan.  What we got was a 1993 Mazda MPV 4WD van.  It had about 63.000 miles on it when we bought it and gets about 18-20 miles per gallon.  We bought it in February of this year and we love it!

It has three doors.  The third door is actually a door and not a sliding door that you find on most other mini vans.  And the back opens up as well.  It is the perfect size for our family.  However, our children are all currently under 10 yrs. old and as they get bigger this vehicle could feel kinda small.  Right now there is plenty of room for passengers but not much extra for cargo or groceries etc.  You do have a little space in the back behind the seats and on the side right by the rear door.  We always seem to cram things wherever we can find space.  It doesn't come with a luggage rack ot top either and that's one thing I wish we had.

The middle and rear seats can come completely out.  And the rear seat can also be folded forward to give more room.  The seats, however, are pretty heavy to get out and it's nice to have two people to get them out.

It has all the controls to go into 4WD inside.  You don't have to get out of the vehicle to switch to 4WD.  We have taken our Mazda into several places we wouldn't go with our car.  We are real pleased with the 4WD.

One thing I find annoying is that when you lock or unlock a door, all the doors will lock or unlock.  This feature is nice sometimes, but can be inconvenient at other times.  The 3rd door for the back seats has a child restraint lock on it which can be activated so that the door can only be opened from the outside.  A wonderful feature if you have little ones.

Things I wish we had:

More cup holders
A bit more leg room in the back
Luggage rack

Overall I really do love this van.  It has a good ride and is comfortable.  I would recommend anyone to give it a try.<br><br>
