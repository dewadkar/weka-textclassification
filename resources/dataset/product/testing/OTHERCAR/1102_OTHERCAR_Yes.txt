            We bought our Fox when it was new, way back in 1990. For the past 10 years, it has been a real trooper! We've driven it across the united States twice, made a couple of trips to Key West, Florida in it, and gone from a childless couple out having fun to a busy family with two wild kids! This car has seen it all and survived it all! I hit a deer in 1994 with this car, travelling at a rate of about 85 miles an hour {the Fox, not the deer}. Despite an tremendous amount of cosmetic damage to the front and left side of the car, the Fox still got me to my college class on time! After $4500 in body work, the Fox gleamed like a showroom beauty. Now, in the year 2000, she could stand a new paint job, but we have NEVER had to sink any other money into her for repairs! Replacement parts are pricey and can be hard to find. The Fox 4 door GL that we own has 100,000+ miles on her, yet still handles like a new car!If you're looking for an inexpensive second car that really reliable, find a used Fox! They haven't made new editions in may years, but a used one can be had pretty inexpensively and pays for itself in reliability and in it's economical fuel consumption. One tip: make sure it's air conditioned! Ours isn't!<br><br>
