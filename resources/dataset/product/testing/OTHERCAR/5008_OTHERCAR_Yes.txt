            Nissan Sentra GXE 2001.

California Styling for the Sentra.

For 2001, the new Nissan Sentra has completely been redesigned. The new styling was done in California and it is the first Nissan made especially for the North American market.

For this Nissan has made the Sentra longer and wider than the 2000 and the 1999 models.

Personally I think that it is a very nice looking automobile. It offers consumers lots of standard equipment and a good variety of options to choose from.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Consumers are offered three models to select from. The basic Sentra is the XE and this year model is $100.00 less than the 1999 XE was. Then there is the GXE model and it is $200.00 less expensive than the same GXE two years ago.  The surprise is with the SE model that is as much as $2000. 00 than the 1999 version.

To achieve such price reduction at the retail market, Nissan had to reorganize its production lines by having the Sentra share its platform with other models in Europe and Japan.

At the same time they are offering consumer a price reduction they are also able to offer a better product. The new Sentra has a new re-styled interior that gives the driver and the passenger more head and legroom, plus a re-styled exterior and a more powerful engine.

Boy, this all sounds very good now let&#146s see if it holds.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

I was very impressed with how the new interior looks like. As soon as I opened the driver&#146s door I liked the new stylish look of the Sentra. Because of the tilt steering wheel that comes standard on the Nissan Sentra 2001 getting in was not a problem.

The all around view is very good, the exception being the rear spoiler that can obstruct the driver view when trying to back up.  All the gauges are positioned in a way that they are very easy to see for the driver and all the control buttons are also easy to see and reach from that position.

The new Sentra comes with an excellent list of standard equipment. Aside from the tilt steering that I already mentioned, it is also equipped with air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD player, rear window defrost, a 60/40 fold down rear seat and the one I test drove had a sunroof also.

As for the front seats in the back seats there is enough head, shoulder and legroom for the back seat passengers to be comfortable.

The exterior:

The exterior of the Nissan Sentra is beautiful; the car I drove had optional alloy wheel and also an optional sunroof. It really made for a good-looking automobile.   

The cargo space at 11.6 cubic feet is a little restricted but if you consider that the rear seat has a 60/40 fold down seats, that may add the room you might need if you do not already have a full passenger load.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The 2001 Nissan Sentra is a pleasure to drive both on the highway and within city limit. I think that it is a car that offers a lot of value for the money it cost.
