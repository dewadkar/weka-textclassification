            This is a nice little camera.  I have used one model or another in this line several times sincy both my school and several of my relatives own them.  The inner workings are very easy to figure out.  Though I must say I am somewhat disappointed in the lack of color quality.  The images come out somewhat grainy and I have mixed feelings about the use of the floppy drive.  The graininess only becomes a problem if you want blown up images.  For basic portraits, or use online, this is an excellent piece of machinery.  The use of floppy technology is somewhat limiting, especially on the models with video options.  You can't really do anything with the video since it doesnt' include audio and you can only capture a handfull of seconds of action.  For basic purposes it is an excellent deal though.<br><br>
