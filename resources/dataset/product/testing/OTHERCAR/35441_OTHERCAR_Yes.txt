            When I turned 16 I was lucky enough to inherit the services of my Dodge Shadow convertible.  This car was perfect for a teenager new to driving.  The engine does not have much power therefore I was less likely to participate in exhibition driving.  My car was pretty slow but it still looked good.  The convertible top was a favorite among friends and girls.  The car purchased used is now relatively inexpensive.  Driving the vehicle is still fun but, the next car I buy will have a little more power.  I would recommend the vehicle to young inexperienced drivers who still want to have a good looking vehicle.<br><br>
