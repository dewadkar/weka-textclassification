            Wow! In my opinion, nothing great has ever come from the Mercury name, but this car is definitely the exception.  The cougar is an absolutely great car.
It looks great, it is sleek and streamlined, and looks like a big missle speeding down the highway.  The lights on this car are unique and attractive, and this car is definately a head turner.  On the inside, this car is also very nice.  The front bucket seats are very comfortable.  In the back however, it will definitely be cramped for anyone over six feet tall, even though the seats are very comfortable.  Everything is conveniently placed, and easy to read.  Riding inside this car is sheer fun.  However, I have noticed the blind spots, but this really isnt a big deal at all, and I wouldnt worry about it.  The handling is great, the acceleration is quiet, confident, and powerful (it is a V-6 engine remember) and driving is just easy in this vehicle.  Mine is an automatic, but for your sitck fans, there are manual models out there.

The best aspect of this car is its price.  For only about $18,500 you can get a great car with so much to offer. 
*Bottom line - This is the best thing thats ever come from the Mercury name to date.  I am impressed
