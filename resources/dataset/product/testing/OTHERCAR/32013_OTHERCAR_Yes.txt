            I used to have a 1997 ES 300 - black with tinted windows and black leather seats.  I LOVED this car!  It was the BEST car I've ever driven.

First of all, the presentation given by the dealership was incredible.  When we went to pick up the car (dealership in KC, MO) the salesperson took my dad and I into a private room and asked us to wait there.  When she turned on the lights, the car was inside the room.  The lights were dim and the walls were mirrored.  The salesperson gave me a complete rundown of the whole car - where things were, how they worked, etc.  It was like a private party where I was given a huge gift!  It was absolutely wonderful!

Anyway, the actual car itself was also wonderful.  The seats were so comfortable that you could sleep in it.  The roominess was enough for a guy six feet five inches tall - both in the front and back seats.  I had black leather interior, which of course made for a HOT summer and a COLD winter!  But the front seats had seat warmers for winter time and they DID help!  :)

Another pro is how smooth this car drives.  It is so smooth that most bumps in the road were like tiny pebbles under your tires.  The engine was extremely soft and hardly loud enough to hear at all!  Inside the car, with all the windows rolled up, this is the quietest car I've been in.

I highly recommend the ES 300.  It's the least expensive of the Lexus', and completely worth the money!<br><br>
