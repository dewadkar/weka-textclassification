            Since we have gotten our 2000 Avalon, we have taken all our family trips in it. (family of 4)  It's spacious and comfortable even for those long drives.  It's quite nice as a passenger and absolutely wonderful as a driver.

As a passenger, two adult-sized women can sleep rather comfortably in the back seat, which is a must on long trips.  As well, the passenger seat in front is quite easy to sleep in.  Aside from the sleep aspect, being a passenger, you have your own light that is just so as not to disturb the driver.  Also a feature that I think is wonderful is that the middle seat in the back has an over-the-shoulder seat belt as opposed to just a strap.  It feels good when you're carrying 5 people to know that no one's safety is compromised because of the vehicle.

This vehicle is truly a joy.  It even accomodates itself for two drivers of different stature.  The driver's seat itself is equipped with a two setting memory for the placing of the seat.  So switching drivers is much less of a hassle when you just push the button and the seat moves to exactly where you need it.  

Driving this car really is pleasant and relaxing.  It rides so smoothly and effortlessly; it really does make long trips seem to go by more quickly.  It runs very quietly, discreetly but does so without compromising the power that is sometimes needed when driving.  Even using extra power to merge onto the interstate etc., this car smoothly does as it is told.

One thing I will point out about it, I have seen that on the interstate when there is a reasonable cross wind this car wobbles some.  Not to where you feel out of control, but it is something you notice a bit.  Most of the time though this car rides smooth as glass.

Sitting in the driver's seat, you can feel how much space you have between yourself and the windshield.  And you can see how wide the windshield is.  In some cars the windshield is small and so sight is obstructed.  Looking through the windshield of this car, it is quite easy to see everything.

The dashboard is so nice.  It is digital and tells the time of day, the trip time (how long the engine has been running), outside temperature, inside temperature and tells you in which direction you are going.  The information is very explicit and easily available and usually easy to see.  I have noticed that there are times in the day when the display is harder to see.  I will say that this display is much nicer than that of a Lexus.  Much easier to read. (this area in the Avalon is also much more spacious than the Lexus)

I like the sound system in this car.  There is a cassette player and a 6-cd player.  It's such a pain to have to get into the trunk to change your cds.  The system is easy enough to use to change cds in and out while you drive.  Also the radio gets great reception.  No matter where you go, you can push a button and this car will find all the available radio stations in the area.

Air-conditioning works great.  Though, the air can only be controlled in the front.  So basically those in the back seat are at the mercy of those in the front two seats.  The vent is located at the back of the console and cannot be shut.  We often bring an extra shirt to put over it when we get cold.

As far as aesthetics is concerned, I think it accomplishes simple elegance inside and out.  The interior is simple leather with a sort of marbled brown look around the controls.  When you get in this car, it doesn't seem plain; it seems dignified, clean, and ready for work.

As far as the outside is concerned, I think it is a classy car to look at.  This car is attractive from all sides and comes together to make a beautiful car.  The old body style of this car, in my opinion, was very plain and uninteresting to look at.  I think with this new body style there is the perfect amount of angles and contours to make it very attractive.
