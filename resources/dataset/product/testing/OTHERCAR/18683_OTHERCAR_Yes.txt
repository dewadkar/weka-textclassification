            I own several merkur Xr4ti's.  I just love these cars.  They get a real bad reputation, because people do not maintain them as they should.  They are very quick, so they get raced and then when thy break, people blame it on the car and not the driver!.  
I admit parts are very hard or expensive to find! They no longer make them here so that is the main problem.  
I am in the process of getting my 1985 fixed.  I bought it with a blown head gasket (someone let it overheat after racing), and just decided to have it rebuilt.  I am also getting the interior fixed as well.  The 1985 til 87 all had a recall for the leather splitting.  
If you can find one that was taken care of I would suggest it.  I love the ride, and the speed.  They get very good gas mileage.  They also have seat warmers, automatic windows, adjustable seats for comfort, and are made for comfort.  I could live in this car.  
If you do ever own one beware of the occasional mechanics who say a what?  Then say oh yeah I can fix it.  An expert would know that they are just like a Mustang SVO!  Most are just scared.  There is nothing difficult about this car.  Just treat it as you would any other car.  Maintain your engine, use good gas, get regular changes.(required more often as it is turbo).
One word of advice to those occasional idiots, if you race it, DO NOT shut off the engine until it cools itself down.  This is a major cause for cracked heads and block!
