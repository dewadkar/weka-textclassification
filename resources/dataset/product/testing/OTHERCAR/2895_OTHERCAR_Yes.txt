            My '85 Celica GT-S reached 200,000 miles and was really starting to show it in repair bills, so I decided to buy a new car. I wanted something with relatively low miles and CHEAP (I just finished high school). This $1000 Colt hatchback off eBay with 80,000 miles fit my criteria quite well.

Overall, I've been quite impressed with the car I got for the price I paid. Both the interior and exterior are very nice looking for such a cheap car--leaps and bounds ahead of same-age Metros, Escorts, and Aspires. The previous owner took very good care of the car; the only cosmetic defects inside and out are a few parking lot and hail dings. The interior especially looks like new.

Mechanically, I did have to replace the transmission a month after I bought the car, but this was mostly my fault. The seller had an inspection done before I bought it which listed no problems except a slight transmission fluid leak. I ignored this; all the fluid leaked away, GRIND GRIND GRINDing sounds and I had to buy a new tranny. Pretty cheap though--standard 4-speed. I still think I got a deal on the car, even after spending the $$$ for the repair bill. Other than this, I have had no problems at all for the year I've owned the car.

The car has adequate power without the A/C turned on (which is rarely needed where I live). It can make it up hills just fine, merge on the free way quickly and pass people, and reach &gt;90 mph (ummm... hypothetically &lt;grin&gt;)

I do wish with my Colt had a little more space, however. I'm 6'1" and the driver's seat seemes a little cramped, even with the seat all the way back. It's fine most of the time, but trips over 2 hours are a slightly uncomfortable.  Not a problem at all for shorter people. The back seat, though, is very small and best suited for children. I couldn't imagine seating three adults back there. But Fold the rear seat down and you can squeeze quite a bit of stuff back there.

The car's pretty light on options. Two things I would really like are power steering and an intermittent windshield wiper (it rains a <i>lot</i> around here). A cigarette lighter would be nice too so I could plug in my cell phone. You'd think they could've included a cigarette lighter! I replaced the radio with a CD deck and subwoofer... it sounds fantastic--hatchbacks really shine on this aspect.

Good car.
