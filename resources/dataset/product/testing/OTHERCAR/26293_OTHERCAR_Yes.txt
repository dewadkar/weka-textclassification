            I bought a new 2000 Honda Civic DX Hatchback in August 2000. I had previously owned a 1985 Civic Hatchback.  I was pleasantly surprised at the price of the new car. Incidentally, this was the first NEW car I had ever purchased. No, it was not cheap, but I felt that the price was reasonable (well, comparatively). I purchased during the &quot;end of year&quot; sales to get a better price.  However, I was unable to get standard shift because of this and had to search high and low to find the silver color I wanted. 
 I have never owned an automatic transmission car before so this has been a major adjustment.  I especially feel that automatics simply do not have the &quot;pick up&quot; of a standard shift. 
 What I like:  the car is very comfortable to drive; it gets great gas mileage; I trust the make/model from my previous experience and expect to own/drive it for 10 -15 years. I love the hatchback because it seems I always need to haul something - whether it's the bookshelves I suddenly decide to buy at K-mart or the 20 pound bag of cat food, it pretty much always fits in the car. The hatchback opening on the 2000 model is larger than on the 1985 and this has proven to be most useful. 
 What I do not like:  call me a luddite, but I still prefer standard shift (just personal preference, I suppose); the 2000 model is (to me)much larger than the '85 - I'm still having trouble parallel parking; the back windows no longer open (I'm dead in the water when the AC eventually dies); there is NO DAMN ASHTRAY!!!! I know I live in Kentucky, but this FORCES me to LITTER!!! Oh, and BTW, the steering is SOOO much easier on the 2000 than on my &quot;85 or even on my mom's '95.<br><br>
