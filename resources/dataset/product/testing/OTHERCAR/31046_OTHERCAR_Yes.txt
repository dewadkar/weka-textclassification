            I was preparing to turn in my leased car at the end of March of 1998.I traveled the competitive new car lots with the hope that I would find a vehicle that would &quot;knock me out&quot;.  It would also help if the initial costs would be within my hoped for range.  

The one thing that I remembered about the Infiniti automobile was that the advertising comprised of a lot of trees, rocks and streams and suggested a car but never showed one.  With this in mind, I could not prejudge the Infiniti lineup.  I was shown the then new I30.  I was informed that it had front wheel drive (my preference).  I headed for the interstate to &quot;give it a workout&quot;.  It didn't take me long to make comparisons with the best car that I had ever owned, a 1986 BMW 535.
I would not have you believe that this Infiniti had the power of the 535 but for overall performance ie acceleration, braking, stability and comfort,this car received high marks in my book.  This car has all the creature comforts of a car costing much more.  This car lists for a modest $30,000.00 and puts it ahead of other cars in this price range.  This is why I plan to purchase this car when the lease terms are fulfilled.<br><br>
