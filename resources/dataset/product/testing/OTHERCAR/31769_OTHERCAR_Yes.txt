            The M3, what a drive.  Hardly any drop-off when you shift even slowly.  Not only holds the road, but barely tilts when rounding turns at speeds higher than one should. Great feel to steering and solid sounds everywhere, even the exhaust.  

BUT, after just two months, some annoying problems,

- &quot;check engine&quot; light comes on
- the top of the gear shift lever came off as I was shifting
- seat belts seem to tighten as one drives
- one of plastic window decals for security system peeling off

Also, it is hard to believe how little space is inside for storage.  Driving and passenger seating is fine, but there are very few places to store anything.
