            Acura RSX Premium, 2002

Bye Integra, Hello RSX.

It took Acura quite a while but they have finally replaced the Integra with a new model. The new Acura is called the RSX.

The RSX is a very well equipped car with a long list of comfort and safety standard features. Acura is going all the way to make the RSX a success and they did not cut any corners.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The RSX is a sport coupe that comes in three different trims. The base trim is the RSX, then the median trim is the RSX Premium, both are powered by 16-valve DOHC 4-cylinder motor. The RSX Type S is powered by a high-powered twin-cam 2.0-liter engine that will develop 200 horsepower. This is an incredible 100 horsepower per liter and is only out done by the Honda S2000 and some Ferraris.

The Acura I had the pleasure to drive was a RSX Premium, so the remainder of this review will concentrate on that trim.

The Acura RSX Premium 2002 has a curb weight of 2701 pounds and a wheelbase of 101.2 inches. It measures 172.2 inches in length, 67.9 inches in width and 51 inches in height.

Both front and rear track of the RSX Premium 58.5 inches.

As the RSX is a new model for Acura, they are trying to lure new customer by offering it to consumers fully loaded with comfort features.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The interior cabin of the RSX Premium is very small, but also very organized. Once I opened the driver side door I immediately knew that I was going to enjoy driving this fine sport coupe.

After taken place behind the steering wheel and adjusting the seat and mirrors, I sat back for a while noticing the refined interior of the RSX Premium. The interior is made with fine leather and the workmanship is superior. 

The driver will have an excellent all around view. I particularly like the oversized side view mirrors mounted on the RSX. This is quite unusual for a sport coupe and it will give the driver a very view of on coming traffic.

The hood of the RSX is slumped toward the front; this gives the driver a much better view of the front of the automobile.

The RSX Premium I drove was fully equipped with a very long list of comfort standard features which included the following: air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather-heated seats, AM/FM radio, CD player, sunroof, rear window defroster and alloy wheels.

The sound system in the RSX is of superior quality; I have a habit of binging with me a CD that will test the range of the sound, and in the RSX the quality of the speakers is one of the best I have heard in a long time.


In the Acura RSX the front headroom and legroom is somewhat tight and for space in the back seat area it is even more restrictive.

The exterior:

The exterior of the Acura RSX Premium has a sleek look styling. The paint job is first rate.

The cargo volume is surprisingly big; it is whopping 17.8 cubic feet. This should be big enough for carrying your gears or groceries.

The alloy wheels styling are appropriate, the RSX I drove had a 5-spoke design and they enhance the look of the RSX.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Acura RSX I drove had under the hood:

Engine: DOHC 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, 16-valve i-VTEC system that develops 160 horsepower at 6500 RPM  
Transmission: 5-speed manual transmission.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS.
Tires: 205/55R16
Safety: Dual front air bags.
           Side airbags.
           Child safety locks.
            Keyless remote entry.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Driving the Acura RSX Premium 2002 was a very nice experience. It is certainly a fine automobile with a superior engine.

The RSX handles very well on the highway and as far as city driving aside from the fact that it has a manual transmission it is easy to drive on city streets.

The one point I did not like is the restricted legroom space even in the front of the cabin.
