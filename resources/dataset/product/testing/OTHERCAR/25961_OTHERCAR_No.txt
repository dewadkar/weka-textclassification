            I chose this car based price, value, and well it was a Chevy.  I'm from the Heart of America, Indiana.  Chevy town.  Of course, I get nice discounts too because of family members who work for GM - so I was a little biased.  

I got an excellent deal.  It listed at near $17,000 and after taxes and extras i only had to finance $14,000 and I didn't make a down payment. It came with all the perks, CD player, cruise, power windows, racing stripe, etc....

I was looking for a 4 door because my 2 door Beretta was becoming too cumbersome with a 2 year old daughter. But, I should have done a little more homework.  I was interested in the Malibu but the &quot;homework&quot; I did on this model was not encouraging and there was that deal hanging out there on the cavalier.  

It just doesn't have enough room.  I feel cramped ALL of the time.  I should have put the car seat, diaper bag, toy bag, purse, and whatever else I'm hauling around for the test drive.  Then, I would have realized that my child kicks the back of my seat everytime she moves an inch.  I should have sat in the back seat with a people in the front seat and realized the lack of blood flow to my legs.  I just &quot;should have&quot; a million more times.   

<b>I really am dissapointed in this car, even though I am a born Chevy fan.</b>  

The brakes on the car are not that resilient and I had to have them serviced after 6 months. Although, the dealership took care of me and gave me a free oil change for my troubles. 

There also seems to be a weird oily film emitting from the defrost onto the windows.  I've tried everything to clean it and there is always a residue that just keeps getting thicker and thicker.  Makes it hard to see at night.

The keyless entry has acted up a few times and the horn alarm on the security feature is getting softer that you can barely hear when you lock the car.  This is the ONLY way to enter the car.  I'm fearful if it ever stops working all together.

I've only had the car 8 months and the black paint is starting to wear off on the radio buttons. 

The 4 cylinder engine has very little pick-up and most times I feel like I'm emitting a high pitch vibration when I'm on the interstate.  

<b>There are some things that are constant with a Chevy and this car is not exception.</b>

Reliability.  Other than the annoying things mentioned above, I have had no problems with the car.  It starts, it goes, and does everything it should. The electrical system and digital components have not even hinted at causing problems.

Sound construction.  I don't have any loose or noisy parts.  The interior is rugged and easy to clean.  Even with a 2 year old, a box of crayons, and a 90 degree summer day.  

It gets excellent gas mileage.  Better than listed in the manual.  I get about 25-28 mile to the gallon.  

Low Maintenance.  Few scheduled tune-ups etc. and it is easy to wash and keep clean.

I would say that this is an average car and below Chevy's usual standards.  I'm going to trade it in on something else when I won't take such a hit on the trade-in value.  This cavelier also does not seem to have a good trade-in value.  I realize that it is such a new model and won't for a couple of years but it still seems to be lower than usual for a Chevy.  <br><br>
