            I bought this camera a few months back and have never looked back, it is great for everything I have ever wanted to use it for.

I am an amateur photographer but with this camera I still manage to take some great photos with this camera.  I mostly use the camera for shots of friends when I go out to parties, clubs and pub's and although most people give it the thumbs down when it comes to low light photos I find the results to be just as good as daytime provided the target is within about 4-5m after that the quality starts to go down hill but u can still take good shots you just need to spend a bit more time making sure you focus on the target.

I don't think I have ever been able to take a bad shot during the day the photos are perfect in every way as far as I can see.  The colours are bright and clear and you'd be surprised at the level of detail these cameras can capture.

I have had quite a few printed out professionally, which costs the same as normal film, and I don't think anyone could pick them apart from a normal 35mm camera if anything they come out better.

The camera is tiny and fits right in your pocket with ease, it has a strong metal body with the exception of the battery cover, which feels a bit flimsy, but I haven't had any problems with it.  I have dropped the camera twice now onto solid surfaces and besides a few scratches on one of the corners it is as good as new.  The preview screen is good and displays the images clearly and is great for lining up the photos, I never use the optical viewfinder.  The camera is easy to use I have stuck to the automatic mode which I have had no problems with and it always seems to take good photos.  There is a manual mode which I haven't explored in any great depth and it is my opinion that for any normal person this mode is not of much use, but I&#146m sure it can be put to good use by the more professional photographer.  There is also a stitch mode so you can take a series of overlapping shots and join them together which is good for those scenery shots but again I haven&#146t had much use for it.

The camera also has the capability to capture 30sec movies with sound which are great for those moments you want to remember but a photo just won't cut it.

As far as shutter lag goes it is pretty quick but defiantly not instant, it is at worst around the 1-second mark in low light and a bit less in well-lit areas or in the sunlight but is generally pretty quick.  The camera has a focus assist beam which it shoots out when you half depress the button if there is not enough light for the camera to pick something to focus on, I find this to be a great feature because it means you don't need to be looking at the view finder when you take a picture and in low light the display is useless because it is to dark to make out what your looking at anyway.  The beam projects as a round circle on what ever you aim the camera at and is basically the middle of the photo you are about to take so after dark I scrap the display and rely almost entirely on the beam to line up my photos, I just half depress the button aim the circle at my target then take the shot, but I think you do need to be careful when doing this because I think the focus locks on the initial target so you need to either shoot at something about the same distance away or once you line it up take your finger off then take the photo.

The battery life is the main con but it isn't to bad I have a 256MB flash card and would never be able to fill it with photos on 1 battery.  The most I have ever been able to take is 197 photos, 99% of those with flash, but on average with flash about 120 photos which is fine for a night out.

The only other main con is the standard 16MB flash card, which I feel is basically a throwaway job.  I only take pictures on full quality and least compression, which average out to be about 1MB per photo making a 16MB flash card virtually useless.  I have, as I mentioned, a 256MB card which basically holds 250 photos.

So in closing I read a lot of reviews on other cameras before choosing this one and I have not regretted my choice at all. It is small, takes great photos, is easy to use and has all the features I could ever want.
