            I will be the first to openly admit that I don't like minivans.  There, I said it.  I didn't like the first one that Chrysler Corp. released in the 1980's, I don't like the current crop, and I don't plan to start liking them.

That said, I DO respect Chrysler for starting an entire automotive revolution...not many vehicles can claim the effect that the first Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager had on the American Mobile Family.

So when my wife and I saw a showcase on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; that featured a new Chrysler Town &amp; Country and a pair of boxer shorts...and was valued over $40,000 dollars, our jaws hit the floor.  &quot;How expensive can a <i>minivan</i> be?&quot; we asked ourselves.  &quot;I mean, what can they possibly put in a <i>minivan</i> that would cost over $30,000?&quot;

So we headed to the local Chrysler dealer and test drove the top-of-the-line Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited AWD.  Sticker price?  Over $36,000.

If there is such a thing as an attractive minivan, the Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth family is it.  Whether it's through sheer practice in the genre, or whether some of the Viper and Prowler enchantment has filtered its way down the ranks, DaimlerChrysler's minivans are a well-balanced blend of curves and bulges, with just a hint of aggressiveness.  The Town &amp; Country comes with standard alloy wheels and chrome doorhandles to accent the shape.

Inside, leather seats are standard, and there are five of them:  Four bucket seats comprise the first and second rows, with a three-person bench seat in the third row.  A full array of trip computers, bells, whistles, cupholders, vent nozzles, reading lights and other gadgets are offered.  There's even a storage drawer under the front passenger's seat.  Seating was comfortable, with plenty of room to stretch in both the first and second rows.  Also, the view from the driver's seat is excellent, due to the expansive windshield and tall seating position.  

On takeoff, the 180-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 provides plenty of oomph, channelled through the four-speed automatic transmission.  The T&amp;C accelerated well enough that I wondered, &quot;Why do so many of these things get driven <i>so</i> slowly??&quot;  Handling was, as advertised, truly carlike -- nothing like the full-size Dodge Ram Van that my parents owned, years ago.  It was easy to keep the T&amp;C in my lane, easy to turn corners and easy to park, despite the much-observed difficulty with these tasks that many minivan drivers display.  I can firmly say, it's not the minivan's fault.

Which brings me back to price.  The van we tested was listed for over <i>$36,000.</i>  We paid almost 10 grand less for a brand-new Volvo.  The Mercedes C230 Kompressor stickers at $31,750.  The Lexus ES300 lists for $31,505.  The Land Rover Discovery II is priced at $34,150.

More importantly, the Dodge Grand Caravan AWD offers the same engine, transmission and four-wheel traction, and only costs $28,245.  Are gadgets, leather seats and chrome doorhandles worth over $7,700 to you?  If so, buy a Town &amp; Country Limited AWD.  If not, get the Dodge model, and send your kid to college with the difference.<br><br>
