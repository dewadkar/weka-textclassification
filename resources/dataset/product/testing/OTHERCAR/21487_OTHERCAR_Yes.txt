            That's right it's a &quot;Hottie&quot;! This is my third Grand Prix and the absolute best by far. Now that I've had the heads up display feature it will be hard to live with out it in the future. The ABS system and the wider track sure make a difference when you're driving in the snow belt areas. With the GTP option that I have, acceleration in tight situations is not a problem ( and just for fun). Do not buy this car if you don't like people stopping and drooling over your car! I have the four door version for the first time and love the ease of getting in and out with out sacrificing a sporty look of the two door.<br><br>
