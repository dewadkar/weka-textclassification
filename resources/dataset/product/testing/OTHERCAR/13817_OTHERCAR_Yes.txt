            I picked up my 2001 S500 in September 2000. I waited until the second year of the new model to make sure the kinks would be worked out.

The features on this car are truly amazing. I can use voice commands to operate the phone, the audio system and the navigation system.

There is a new portable phone with all the features that can be used with the car (muting the audio when a call comes in and being integrated in the car commands) or separately as a handheld.

I could go on and on about the positives of this car, which just handles like a dream, with a suspension that is just right, not too firm and not too soft.  But the reader should just assume that everything is perfect with the following exceptions that MB really needs to work on.

The command center, which has an LCD monitor display, and handles audio, telephone and navigation system, and which can be operated by voice, by steering wheel controls and on the dash board, needs to be more intuitive.  It is complicated to learn and, at least the voice system, not always reliable.  This should be touch screen controlled and the required inputs should be minimized. Remember, the driver is using it while driving (even if this is not recommended - hey, let's be realistic here).

This command system is both an amazing feature of this car and shows that it is not a mature technology adapted to the way it will be used.

Second, the price of this baby is up there. And, to make it worse, there are no discounts and the lease money factors are ridiculously high. I guess MB is just taking while the getting is good.  They must be making a killing, especially with the dollar exchange rate being so high.

Bottom line: This car has no real competition. Anyone who compares it to the usual suspects (BMW, Jag, Lexus, Infinity) knows they are not at the same level. But there is still work to be done, and the new BMW 7 series to come out within a year should keep MB honest.
