            I love my car. I thought about buying a new  car for several months, but did'nt know what I wanted. I wanted something with get up and go, but a luxury car, but also sporty. Well I just happened to mention this to my brother and he said,&quot; I know exactly what you want&quot;. So off we went to the nearest dealer. In two hours I drove my new car off the lot. Boy was my husband surprised when I came home. I have the super charged model and it moves! As a women I don't know all the technology  of my car, but don't really care. All I know is I have'nt had one problem with it and I love it.  P.S. So does my husband, after the shock wore off, now he  threatens to go buy a Harley!! LOL<br><br>
