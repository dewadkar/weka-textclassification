            We bought a 96 Camry, brand new, for about $20,000. It's been an excellent car. We wanted safety, reliability and quality...and our 96 Camry has proven to be wonderful in every category. We live in a cold climate; it's a solid car that bites the road and has never gotten stuck. Our 5 year old climbs in and out easily, and I feel good knowing she's safe in the middle of the backseat. We have had a few little problems: the passenger door handle spring broke and that cost us $100 to fix. We were concerned about a strange brake noise after it's parked, but were told that's normal. We had a fender bender and the body work was not excesive. The drive is wonderful and powerful. Fuel consumption is more than I want at 20 mpg, but highway is about 27. We have a lot of hills, so we opted for v6. I think the less powerful engine might be a different experience. Brakes are good. Visibility is good. It's really a bigger car than we're accustomed, so that might be a change for people who think Toyota's are small and easily maneuverable. It still looks and rides great. We do dealer servicing, just because it's convenient. I do sometimes feel like the whole world is driving this car b ecause I see it everywhere, but there's a reason: it's safe, reliable, comfortable and not overly expensive.<br><br>
