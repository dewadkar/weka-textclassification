            Hello friends! I purchased the Sony Mavica F-91 about a year ago for $900.My goal was to find a camera that needed no plug in cables or hook-ups.The computer system I use ,is using all my ports.So, for me, the choice was obvious,get a camera that uses a floppy as film!
        My goal for the camera was for multi use.I am a full time Real Estate Broker and needed a method of taking lots of pictures without the hassles of film developing.I did not want an entry level camera that would be outmoded in a couple of years.I wanted a camera that would let me grow and learn, and not hold me back from professional quality shots.This camera offers me what I seek.
        The pictures I take, are used for quality Real Estate web sites,brochures,appraisals,insurance,etc..They need to be of high quality and have a high resolution.I also have a baby and a 3 year old ! Besides needing pictures fast for various marketing purposes,sendng out family shots has become a fun daily hobby.My email lists are amazed at the shots I send out. In addition to my work and family shots,I enjoy taking candid shots of our friends.We live in NJ, overlooking the Shrewsbury River and Atlantic Ocean.I have been taking amazing sun up shots looking out over the water.Every day offers an amazing subject for photos.I would have spent more than the price of this camera on developing.
      My favorite shots were from my son's birth last May ! I sent out a family shot of the baby,my daughter and my wife and I, within minutes of Jason entering the world!It blew away our relatives and friends!
       I have 2 complaints, out of so many positives.One area that bothers me is the time it takes in between snaps.After taking the shot,you have to wait for a few seconds to be ready again.This breaks up the moment and sometimes you miss the shot due to this time lag. The other area is the size and weight of the camera.The image stabilization adds alot of this bulk. Maybe an F-91 with no stabilizer would be a nice choice. 
     The mpeg video function is fun! I send out neat little kiddie movies to my family ! All in all, this is a fun camera that offers you professional quality shots.My best friend Art , from Gallco.net , got one of these also and uses it for his business and fun.We send each other some of the great shots we capture.
     One other area that makes this camera so nice is the fact of privacy.You can take pictures of private subjects, from business to private adult shots without fear of others peaking at them ! We have all heard stories of photo labs hanging up people's private pictures on their back walls and stuff !! Buy one ! They are great cameras and you will LOVE the quality of your art!!<br><br>
