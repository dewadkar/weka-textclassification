            When I first started looking at Mazda cars, I was looking for a used 929 and could find none.  I fell in love with the looks of a '97 Millenia and found after comparative shopping for a few more dollars a month I could lease a brand new 98 Millenia.  We chose the Mazda over a Toyota and Honda because we have two rather tall teens that the back seat would need to accommodate comfortably for road trips.  The Millenia is roomy, yet compact.  Smooth and quiet interstate travel. Comparing it to past new car purchases/leases the paint appears to be more prone to scratching and nicks very easily.  The only other complaint would be where the cup holder is located (between the front seats, instead of from the dashboard). Leaves messy drips and rings on console. Roomy storage in the arm rest compartments of both the driver and passenger doors, as well as in the console area.  Additional storage can be found on the backs of the driver and passenger seats.<br><br>
