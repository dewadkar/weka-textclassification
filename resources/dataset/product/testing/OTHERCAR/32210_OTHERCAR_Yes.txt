            I have just experienced owning a Cavalier, for the second time and must compliment Chevrolet on the quality versus the price of this model. I am comparing the Cavalier to a Prizm, which I had in between the 1974 and 1999, Cavalier.
Although it is less expensive than the Prizm, the Cavalier handles and rides much better. The anti-lock breaks and the rack and pinion steering combine with its unusual pep to provide a comfortable ride. The 99 model I have now is just a basic version and provides economy without the &quot;cheap&quot; feel of other compacts. 
There are just two small details that I do not like. The shift console {automatic} does not light up, but rather &quot;lights&quot; up on the dash like a column shift would do. My problem is that it &quot;lights up&quot; in a bright orange that is almost red in hue. Being used to red lights on the dash usually meaning a problem exists, when my eyes gaze at the dash while driving, a mental alarm goes off in my head until I realize it is just an indicator. Any distraction while driving is important so I feel this is a negative.
The other detail is more of an nusance than a problem. The dials on the audio console are too small in configuration. They stack the on/off dial on top of the balance control so that unless you have fingers of a five year old, you are forever changing the balance by turning the unit on or adjusting the volume. <br><br>
