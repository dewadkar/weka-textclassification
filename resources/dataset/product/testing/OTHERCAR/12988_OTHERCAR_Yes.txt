            I bought this car in August of 2000, just after it came out. I was looking for a small economy car, because the job I had just gotten was 30 miles away through the city. I would be driving alone, so I wanted something reliable and easy to handle, easy maintenance, and a comfortable ride, since I'd be in it for 2-3 hours out of my day. I got what I was looking for.

The end price of my car was just a tad over $11,000. It seemed like a good deal at the time. (I don't claim to have spotless credit!) The salesman was a bit too pushy, but I went with my husband, and all was well. I went home Sunday evening with my new car. I bought a stock model, which had power steering & brakes, air conditioning, a cassette deck, dual airbags, and was automatic. That's it. No power windows, locks, etc. Everything else about my car is manual. It's fine. I am usually the only one riding, so it works out. The gas cap opens from the outside, and it has no lock, but it is easy enough to add if I needed one.

The ride is quiet and smooth. As with most cars, turning on the a/c drains a lot of the power, but I expected that for a compact car. One thing to note, though: my car has turned itself off 4 times without reason or warning. Fortunately it has been when the car is slow-moving. (I have not found any common denominators between the events, such as heat, speed, etc.) However, I have spoken with other Kia owners and this seems to be isolated to my car. Hopefully this will be resolved when I take it in this weekend for its first major tune-up.

The car handles well. It is small, easy to maneuver, and visibility is good around the car frame. The rear window is pretty large as well. Back seats are fairly roomy, I can fit in the back seats with no problem. The car sometimes has problems picking up speed when I have 2 or 3 passengers, but again, I expected that for a compact car with little horsepower. It gets great gas mileage, usually about 30mpg. I have gotten up to 50mpg when I'm traveling through the desert (straight, flat road).

A very important fact that I must mention is that the brake response on my car is incredible. I had an extremely close call last weekend when I was out driving; someone coming down a hill ran a stop sign right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes and just missed hitting the guy. My own reaction time was good, but the brakes were better. There was very little skidding, no sliding or hydroplaning. (I was going about 40mph.) I was quite impressed, actually. I had never really paid attention to the brake response as I'm a pretty conservative driver, but finding this out really made me feel better about buying this car.

Overall, I'm very happy with my Rio. I plan on keeping this car as an everyday use vehicle and for road trips. It's comfortable, quiet, and affordable. I would recommend the Kia Rio to anyone looking for a smooth and economical ride. :)
