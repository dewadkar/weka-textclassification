               Hello, I work on Mercedes-Benz for a living and can tell you for a fact which one you want. The 300D is a very reliable car, its fuel use is small compared to its gasoline counterpart and the best part is next. The 300D has less relays to go bad. The gas version can break down more often because of electric problems. I drive a 190D for a work car because its dependable and cheap to drive. If a diesel has fuel and air and compression it will run! (of coarse it needs coolant and oil) A Mercedes diesel is a get-you-there car! Now the bad side, the A/C on the car is less than reliable. If you have an R12 model, your best bet is to switch to 134A. The major components are changed and the car has a new A/C system. These are very nice cars, and you'll live through the wreck! Mercedes-Benz is a very safe car, be it a '66 200D or a 2000 model S-Class. I should be a Mercedes salesman! Remember to have a pre-buy inspection on any used MB because the previous owner may not have been as interested in maintaining the car as you may be! This car (as all MB products) is a dream to drive! Anybody who wants a nice car that is a joy to drive should try one out!<br><br>
