            I bought my 1995 Honda Passport used, two years ago. I travel alot and usually alone at night. I need a dependable, reliable vehicle to get me from point a to point b. I am a young female and I can not afford to be stranded on an interstate at three in the morning alone. 

I very feel safe driving my Honda, although it has 85,000 miles. I have never had any mechanical problems with it.It still runs as good as any new car I have been in, if not better!

My Passport has a V-6. The other Hondas I owned had a 4-cylinder. The gas mileage is not what I am used to and could, in all honesty, be a good bit better. My Passport also has four wheel drive, and I have been told that has a little something to do with less MPG. I only get about 18-20 miles/gallon. 

The greatest feature of my Passport is that I can pack lots of junk in it! I have hauled furniture in it, dogs in it and a  small tree! I will never buy a car again! I love the space an SUV offers.
  
I have owned nothing but Hondas in the last ten years, and I will probably never own anything else. Compared to other SUVs in the same category, it is an exceptional buy, and one of the better looking of that year. I have been thinking of purchasing another Passport real soon, although I know my Passport, with 85,000 miles is just getting &quot;broken in&quot;.<br><br>
