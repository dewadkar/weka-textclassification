            The Cavalier is one of the worst vehicles I've seen on the market as far as reliability goes. I bought a 1998 model in July of this year and as soon as the I got it home the car would not shut off. Luckily it was under warranty and was able to have the ignition replaced. The second thing to go wrong was the back seat. The clips that hold it down broke causing the seat to jump around. Once again, the warranty covered it as well. A month later the car started skipping and dragging. Sent it to the shop for a few days and they said it was a frayed spark plug wire. Ok, just when it seems nothing else could go wrong, it was no more than 2 weeks later it would not start. Once I got it started I took it straight to the dealership for them to find out what was going on. One week later I got a call saying they &quot;think&quot; they found a problem but not sure. Everything was going great when I got it back until last week when it started the problem again. Needless to say it will be traded in on a new vehicle real soon.<br><br>
