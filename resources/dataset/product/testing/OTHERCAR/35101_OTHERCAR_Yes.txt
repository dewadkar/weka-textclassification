            We have 144K miles on our 1996 Geo Prizm and it's still in nearly perfect condition.  We keep up with regular maintenance and haven't had any major problems.  We keep thinking about getting a new car to replace this one, but we doubt that we can ever find one that lives up the 96 Geo Prizm in terms of pep (it still has guts on mountain roads), economy (32-39 MPG consistently), comfort, and reliability.  Last summer, we decided to drive across the country on short notice and didn't hesitate to load up the Geo and set out.  

Initially, we had our doubts about this vehicle.  Within the warranty period, the following things broke and were replaced:  headlight, turn signal, windshield wiper, CD/cass radio, 3rd brake light, and rear defroster (replaced the entire back window twice).  Since then, it's been fantastic.

Some of the interior trim pieces are starting to rattle and some of the vents are too loose to stay where you aim them.  But I kind of expect some of that.  After all, this isn't a Lexus.  We live on a dirt road, so I'm honestly surprised with how well it's held up after 6 years of bouncing over washboards and potholes.  We're still on the original shocks, too.

If you find this car used and it has been taken care of, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Obviously others agree--there are a lot of these still on the road.
