            I bought a used 1993 cavalier in December 1998. I have to say for buying the first car I liked, I made a great choice. This car gets excellent gas mileage and runs great. My car has close to 80,000 miles on it. Sure we have had to do the typical repairs on it for it's age. One good thing is my husband and his friends have been able to do all the work:)

Also my brother just bought a 1995 Cavalier. He loves his car. He has had it almost 2 months now and no problems. 

Also the cavalier is a great little car to drive in the snow. We live at the top of a pretty steep hill. A few weeks ago I was driving my brother's cavalier and we had to stop on the hill because someone was stuck and couldn't make it up. So I passed them and this little car amazed me with the power and traction it had to make it up the hill:)

So if you are looking into a small to medium size car, go check out the Cavalier!!! <br><br>
