            I inherited this little car two years ago from my dad, who can no longer drive. I'm pretty happy with it, although a 4 cylinder took a bit of getting used to. I really like the way it handles and I'm not nervous about it getting me from Point A to Point B, as I was with my 89 Cougar. Since it's considered an "old man" car, cops don't even look at me LOL. Sometimes I drive a bit quicker in this car, especially along country roads. I think this car's taken lots of abuse from me, and I'd recommend it for sure.  I wouldn't run out and buy another one, but since I didn't pay anything for this one, I'll just drive it till it literally falls apart, and I can't see that happening anytime soon.
