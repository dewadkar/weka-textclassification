            I love this camera.  After using a much less powerful digital camera I purchased this one and love it.  The Sony MVC-FD91 takes great pictures.  The removable 3.5 inch diskette is easy to use. Just pop it into your computer disk drive and you can view and edit your pictures, no messing with cords and uploading pictures from the camera.  

This camera has a lot of features - the zoom is great.  It has a built in flash.  The steady shot feature is great for those with shaky hand syndrome.  The camera has an easy to use menu section that allows you to view the photos in an index or individually.  It is very easy to delete the pictures you do not want.  I can usually fit about 12-15 pictures per 1.44mg diskette. I have been very happy with the quality of photos.  The battery lasts quite a long time.   

My only complaint about the camera is it's size.  It is somewhat heavy and the large lens makes it somewhat clumsy until you get the hang of it.  

The camera was easy to figure out without studying the manual in depth - something I hate to do.  After using it a few times I'm sure you'll fall in love for it too!<br><br>
