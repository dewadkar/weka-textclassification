            I've been driving a 1998 Honda Accord EX for a little over 2 years now, with no problems whatsoever.  This is actually the one of 2 Accords at my house, the other being a 1990.  With nearly 180,000 miles on it, the 1990 Accord still runs reliably. But the focus of this review, however, will be on the 1998 Accord EX.  

What makes this car so remarkable is the fact that it does everything so well.  While not exactly adrenaline pumping, it is not exactly boring either. This car instills a great sense of appreciation.  

First things first, the styling, both inside and out, admittedly is rather bland but by no means ugly.  Its easy on the eyes and won't go out of style quickly.  

In every sense of the word, the Accord is functional. A particularly striking feature is how huge the windshield is, the benefits of this of course being an incredible view of the road and a remarkable sense of openness and airiness.   The interior is absolutely huge, belying its midsize exterior dimensions.  It is not only roomy, but fairly comfortable as well.  As for ergonomics, everything falls at hand and all the controls are intuitive and well-placed, right where they should be. Climate and radio controls are simple and easy to operate.  The gauges, especially the speedometer, are very legible and fairly large at that. If there is one complaint, it is that the LCD displays are black lettering over a beige screen.  Even at night, the displays glow an unappealing light green.  Sound quality from the radio/cd player is acceptable at best.

Performance is certainly adequate. A 150 HP I-4 mated to a 4 speed automatic is a nice combination. The VTEC endowed engine runs smoothly and revs willingly, and under hard acceleration produces a pleasing roar. Besides that, this engine is ULEV (ultra-low emissions vehicle) and gets truly impressive gas mileage, something we can all appreciate with the gas prices out of control these days.  Handling is decent and steering feel is accurate, despite the thin diameter of the steering wheel. For a car of this size, it seems to be a little &quot;under-tired,&quot; 205s,as opposed to the 195s would be a better bet.  Even the ABS equipped  brakes, while certainly able to bring the car to a halt without drama, leave a little to be desired. It is important to keep in mind that this is not a performance car, nor was it intended to be.

Okay, so you see Accords every where you look, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out why...  For the price, it has all the right moves and is immensely satisfying, in no small part due to the peace of mind it provides. With bullet-proof reliability and the overall high quality of the product, the Accord is tough to beat.<br><br>
