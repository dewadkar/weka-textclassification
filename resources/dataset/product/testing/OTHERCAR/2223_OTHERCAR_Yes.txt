             I bought this vehicle for fuel and reliability. Great fuel but the reliability part has let me feel a bit buggy. 
 First lets start with the tires I live in British Columbia Canada, and we get a lot of bad winter days where driving is bad at best. So I headed to many local tire shops to buy better tires( preferably a set of AT's)for the purpose of 2 things better highway safety and also better offroad traction. Well to my surprise I can find only winter car tires for snow and nothing that will last any length of time offroad in summer.
  Secondly I have had my Suzuki in the shop for 3 things in less then 3600 miles 1. Transfer case kept popping out of 4X4 mode under acceleration, very dangerous in winter when you are going up hill in the snow. 2. Had to change fan assembly because of excessive noise well idiling to warm up. and 3. A new transfer case shift fork is to be installed because it is very difficult to shift into 4X4 mode. But one very positive thing about Suzuki and there service here in Prince George is they are very curtious, helpful, and try to ressolve the problems quickly. 
  Other things to consider is it is very good in traffic with good throttle response and is the greatest thing to park. One concern however is the shortness of it you must be alert at all times in bad weather.<br><br>
