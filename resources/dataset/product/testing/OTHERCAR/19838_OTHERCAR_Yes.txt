            I just got my Impala SS.  It's a 1996 (had to have the floor shifter).  This car gets up and GOES.  Lots of power.  Also the engine is easy to upgrade.  I am thinking of getting some new heads and camshaft to make it REALLY fast.  I have another review on here about the new Z28.  This car is all that the Z28 is not.  It is a beautiful car.  Why they quit making them is a mystery.  The new Impala is a disgrace compared to this car.  Mine came with CD player.  It sounds GREAT (needs some more bass - I'll probably toss in a subwoofer).  The tires are huge.  Power everything.  Easy to read gauges.  Awesome seats.  One complaint might be the lights on the rearview mirror.  I think it makes it too heavy which is probably why mine is loose now.  No biggie though.  Get one of these cars if you can.  Even the insurance is dirt cheap because they think it's a caprice.<br><br>
