            I drove a 2001 Type-S as the lease on my 98 3.0CL was expiring.  I was hoping the Type-S would remedy the things I did not like about my CL, and had a very positive attitude entering the test since sticking with an Acura when leaving my over-mileage lease was so financially favorable.
My first disappointment was that this car still does not offer a manual transmission.  I tried to shift with the FAKE psuedo-manual, which was pointless.  I do not see the point in these tiptronic styled transmissions, which are clearly a marketing gimmick.  If you exceed redline in a low gear, the transmission will shift AUTOMATICALLY.  In addition, when you do speficy a shift, the transmission will handle the clutch at an AUTOMATIC pace, which totally negates the benefit of an automatic.  An aggressive driver, I would still leave this car in drive for maximum performance to avoid wasting my time on the pseudo shifting.
I was hoping for an extremely powerful ride in this car, with Acura FINALLY giving you something to justify paying more than the Accord coupe owners who would otherwise have an identical powertrain.  This is not so.  This car did not feel much quicker than my 3.0CL at all, and getting the power out of it still required the drama of a full FLOOR-IT and let it downshift episode - not the subtle passing performance I desired.  There is still no german-car-esque low RPM sophisticated power available.

The luxury amenities, standard options, and pricing still make this car very attractive - but it is not a true sports car by any means.  It is too heavy and lacks the manual transmission to make it a rice burning high-RPM chainsaw like the Integra Type-R, and it is too under-torqued and overgeared to make it the powerful equivalent of a German sports car.  This car will appeal greatly to a buyer who can only judge a car based on paper specification, with little seat-of-the-pants critique.
I went to Audi, where I found the base 1.8T Quattro coupe with 170HP to feel MUCH more powerful.  The 250hp 2.7T I finally decided on feels VASTLY more sporty than the 260hp offering from Acura.

<b>Addendum</b>

I previously failed to address non-performance related aspects of this car.  Please note that the ride quality is superb, and the vehicle is extremely quiet.  Handling is good, with one MAJOR exception.  As in its predecessors, the turning radius of this vehicle is horrendous.  I owned a '98 CL, and this was a constant source of serious frustration.

The Acura seats leave something to be desired.  This is again something I have seen in models past and present.  I have read in Acura literature that a great deal of work is put into the seats, but the criteria used for comfort do NOT mesh with the criteria I use.  The seats put my back at an odd unnatural angle.  I am a very average sized person, being about 5'9&quot;.  I would have assumed that this was related to my posture until I drove German cars, which I find extremely comfortable. <br><br>
