            We bought this car in January 1995, just before being sent to Germany with the military. The primary reason was the low cost, it was all we could afford, but our Esteem turned out to be the best car we ever owned! I drove on the Autobahn at speeds exceeding 85, the needle was just pointing down at that point and it was a smooth ride.  My husband, not as great of a driver as myself, wrecked it pretty bad and even after that, it continued to perform like new.  I would recommend this car to anyone who doesn't have lots of money, but needs reliable transportation. Yes, it was plain, and there were no bells or whistles, but for the money...Best bet!!<br><br>
