            After shopping for a truck for a few weeks, I found the perfect truck for me! I'd driven several Rangers, new and used, and didn't feel that they were very substantial trucks, but were more like toys. I didn't want a Chevy S10 because they are so homely, and the Toyota trucks seemed too expensive. I hadn't considered a Dodge either due to hearing the stereotypical Chrysler reliability horror stories, but a very nice black Dakota SLT happened to be at the used car dealer that day, so I thought, what's a test drive? I drove it around the block and my first thought was, &quot;Now THIS is a truck!&quot; The Dakota is a midsize truck, but it wasn't only the size of the truck that made it feel superior to me. Everything about it seemed to be better put-together and more substantial than the Ranger, plus the power accessories were a welcome find. Mine has a 175hp 3.9L V6 and automatic with overdrive, power windows and mirrors, door locks, cruise, COLD (!) AC, tilt wheel, dual airbags, limited slip differential and anti-lock rear brakes, among other niceties. It was the feeling of &quot;more bang for your buck&quot; that sold me on the Dakota. After driving the truck now for a month, I am even more pleased than I was initially. Everything works great, and the mileage is running about 16mpg mixed. The club cab lets me take the occasional third or fourth passenger, and I can store other things in back in compartments under the forward-facing rear seats. We can also recline the seats when traveling and sleeping on the road. I absolutely love this truck! I should point out that the truck also has 64K miles on it, so I would say that it is holding up well over time and miles. I plan on driving it a long time, because it really is a solid, reliable truck, and has exceeded my expectations. How many things do you get to you say that about these days?<br><br>
