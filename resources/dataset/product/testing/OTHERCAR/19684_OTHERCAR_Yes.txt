            After I had my second child, I realized that my two-door Nissan would not cut the mustard... so I went virtual hunting. First I decided what I wanted from a car, ie. four doors, ABS brakes, alarm system, etc. Here are the reasons I fell in love with my Saturn:

1. Safety: this is supposed to be one of the safest cars on the market. A lady in our 'neighbor' town was hit by a train in her Saturn! She was drug for two miles, and walked away!

2. Smooth driving: after driving my dreadful Nissan for five years, driving this car is like floating on a cloud. I have a standard transmission, which is loaded with pick-up.

3. Comfort: We recently took a cross-country trip, Texas to Seattle, I had never had a more comfortable ride in a car. The drivers seat has an added lumbar support, which is great!

4. Adjustable shoulder belts: I have always hated the way shoulder belts pull at my neck, Saturn has made their seatbelts adjustable! Even the shoulder belts in the back seat are adjustable... making them safer for the kids to use!<br><br>
