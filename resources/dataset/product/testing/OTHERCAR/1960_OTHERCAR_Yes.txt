            I'm not a big fan of manual transmissions in family sedans. But if you must have a manual gearbox, the Maxima's is one of the best. Nissan, in its belief that most auto reviewers are &quot;car guys&quot; who eschew automatic transmissions, furnished only a manual transmission Maxima for me to test. Therefore, I can't tell you how well the automatic works. That's unfortunate, because about 95 percent of Maxima buyers will choose the automatic. Options on our test model included the &quot;SE comfort and convenience package which added a sun roof, 17-inch alloy wheels with V-rated tires, the eight-way power driver's seat, built-in garage-door opener, variable intermittent wipers and a trunk cargo net; the leather package which also brought the power passenger seat and automatic climate control; and the Bose audio system all most cost  ($899) and its best system you will get then any other cars.
