                 "Hyundai????  Ewwwww!!!" That is the response I got from almost every person who found out that I had purchased one. Well I am here to tell you that I now have those people eating their words after letting them drive the car.
Hyundai, I am happy to say, is for real and for those of you who still have doubts please read on.

     Hello everyone. I know you are probably surprised to see me writing about something other than tools but I just had to submit an opinion on my new Hyundai Sonata. I purchased my Sonata 2 months ago and I am happy and totally satisfied with the car. Hyundai has come a long way in the past 2 years in terms of quality and reliability and the Sonata is proof of it. I initially went to my local Hyundai dealership to check out the Elantra. After taking the Elantra for a test drive I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Overall I was impressed by the car but I was looking for something with a little more horsepower and that was a little bit bigger. The salesman recommended I take a look at the Sonata. At first I was hesitant but after he told me there were some fantastic dealer incentives (which they would pass on to me) as well as an $800.00 rebate I decided I'd at least take a look. I must admit that at first I was not overly excited about the Sonata's exterior design. To me it almost looks like a scaled down Rolls-Royce but over time it has grown on me. After I took the car for a test drive I was hooked. The Sonata's interior is well designed and thoughtfully laid out so everything is within easy reach. Dashboard and radio controls are simple and easy to use. All Sonata's come with simulated woodgrain on the dashboard and door armrests. Now I am not a big fan of simulated woodgrain and I will admit that in some of the Sonata's I looked into, it looked terrible. However if you choose the right combination of interior/exterior colors it actually looks really nice. I suggest the tan leather interior.

     The Sonata drives like a dream. The engine provides ample power and acceleration although it is a little noisy off the line if you step on it. The entire car I feel is very well constructed as road noise is kept to a minimum and even at highway speeds is very quiet. The transmission is smooth and provides effortless gear changes. The car handles well for a vehicle of its size and the seats are very comfortable. Both leg and headroom are excellent although headroom is a little tight on models with a sunroof.

     The Sonata comes with almost every standard feature you can think of. Power windows, locks, mirrors, CD player, rear window defroster and cruise control are just a few. The only standard feature I wish the Sonata had that it doesn't is ABS, however it is available as an option. 
In fact I believe the Sonata has only 3 option packages which include features such as leather, sunroof, keyless entry, and ABS.

     The Sonata is Hyundai's entry into the midsize sedan market and it is intended to compete primarily against the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. One of the deciding factors in my decision to buy the Sonata was the price. I paid just under $20,000 for a fully loaded Sonata GLS with leather. If I had purchased a comparably equipped Camry or Accord I would have paid between $8000 or $9000 more not to mention both of those cars have a far inferior warranty. Which brings me to what Hyundai calls the "Hyundai Advantage" which refers to the warranty Hyundai offers on all it's cars. The "Hyundai Advantage" consists of the following coverage:
     -5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper
     -10 year/100,000 powertrain
     -10 year/100,000 rust and corrosion protection
     -5 year/60,000 roadside assistance
There is no other car manufacturer in the world who can come close to that warranty. The only thing wrong with the "Hyundai Advantage" is that it will not be around forever. It is inconceivable that Hyundai will be able to offer this good of a warranty forever.

     The only real con that I can think of for the Sonata is it's small trunk. It is only 13 cubic feet and on a car of this size is definitely the smallest in it's class. However the rear seats do fold down to accommodate larger items.

     I forgot to mention that the Sonata comes in 2 models. The Sonata GLS and the base Sonata. The base Sonata, while it has the majority of the same standard features as the GLS, comes with a 4 cylinder engine that in my opinion is pretty much worthless. It is severely underpowered for a vehicle of the Sonata's size and only gets 1 extra mile per gallon. I highly recommend getting the GLS which comes standard with a 6 cylinder engine.

     So as you can tell I highly recommend the Sonata. It is an exceptional value and is a very well made, solid car.
For those of you who still think of Hyundai as a second rate car company, I highly suggest that you go and at least check them out. I really believe that you will be happy that you did.
