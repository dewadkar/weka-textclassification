            The GMC Yukon is very comfortable to drive or ride in.
There is more than enough room in the vehicle for long trips.
The cargo space in the back, allows for a surprising amount of gear.
The weekly grocery shopping is a snap, when you could fit all the
grocery bags at easy reach though the back doors of the vehicle.
The engine is relatively quiet,the power of the engine is impressive.

While driving the vehicle,you can easily get the feeling that you
are driving a &quot;luxury&quot; car.The handling and the seating is that good.

The only down side is the mileage. Thirteen miles per gallon in town
and 15 miles per gallon on the highway.

If you are on a budget,this may not be the vehicle for you.
I feel, however, that the price of the GMC Yukon is appropriate for
what you get.
