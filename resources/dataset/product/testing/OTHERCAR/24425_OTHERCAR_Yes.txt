            Let me tell you about this little piece of wonder I bought this summer when I went back home to Japan...

The DSC-S50 CyberShot is a feature-packed, compact 2.1 megapixel camera with a 3x optical and 2x digital zoom. Like most Sony cameras, the S50 also comes with a long-life InfoLithium rechargeable battery. One unusual feature of this camera is its 2-inch color LCD screen, which swings up from the back of the camera and swivels more than 180 degrees. This lets you adjust the position of the display, compose self-portraits, and even swivel the LCD toward the inside of the camera for safe transportation. The display is clearer and brighter than those on most cameras--you can even use it in direct sunlight. Like many camcorders, this one lacks a traditional optical viewfinder--you compose your shots by using the color display. 

Maximum image size is 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, which produces good-quality prints even at sizes up to 8 by 10 inches. Pictures are stored on Sony's proprietary Memory Stick media (when I bought it, it came with a 4 MB stick).

Hobbyists will appreciate the wide range of manual controls, including shutter priority, aperture priority, manual focus, exposure compensation, and a number of special effects. The macro is particularly impressive, focusing on items less than 1.2 inches from the lens. 

This multimedia marvel also lets you make low-resolution (320 x 240 or 160 x 112) MPEG movies up to 60 seconds in length, and a built-in microphone can be used both for movie mode and to add sounds to your still photos.<br><br>
