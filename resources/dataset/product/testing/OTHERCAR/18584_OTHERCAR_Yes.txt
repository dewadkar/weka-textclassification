If 300 dpi is sufficient enough to have good quality pictures, 2.1 mega pixels produce high quality prints with great image resolution.  The name of the game resides in the quality of the prints indeed.  Keep in mind that MP is the measurement of the image resolution.  With Fuji FinePix A201, you will have some great prints.  The more megapixels, the better and sharper the image.  After all, anything beyond 1.5 MP is just fine.  You are not going to be making large prints to post on billboards or road signs any way.  While this digital camera may not come with a flash, it is equipped with 2.5x zoom.  You will have enough control to take your pictures.  What you need to bear in mind is that the digital zoom helps you manipulate the pixels.  It's always good to have the optical zoom which tends to provide a much sharper image.

If you don't have extra batteries, you may feel sorry or get surprised when transferring pictures from your camera to your PC.  

In addition to the USB cable and memory cards, this camera is very easy to use in terms of its automatic and manual control.
