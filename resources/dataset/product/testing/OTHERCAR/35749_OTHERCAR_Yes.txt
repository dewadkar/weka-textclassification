            <b> My Car Background </b>
This is the first Honda I have ever owned. I have previously had:

(1) New Hyundai Excel; 1991-1998 : Engine Caught Fire on the Interstate on my way to work in mid December... that was freaked out.

(2) New Nissan 240SX; 1993-now: still going strong

(3) Used Nissan Sentra (1997 model purchased from Hertz Car Sales); 1998-2003: It just died last week with 165,000 miles on it.

(4) Used Honda Accord (2003 model purchased from Hertz Car Sales); 2004 - ?? (Hopefully at least 2014).

This Accord is a combination of a few things: 
(a) needing a newer car to drive because the Sentra has become increasingly unreliable in recent months.
(b) it's a late Christmas/birthday present, since my birthday is on Dec 30.

<b> The Test Drives </b>
I started off by test driving a 2000 model Toyota Camry. The ride was smooth and cushy with minimal air noise in the cabin. The stereo sounded pretty good in it. But something about the interior just didn't do it for me.

Next I test drove the 2003 Honda Accord. The interior and layout of the cabin was much much better I thought. It drove really easy and the seats were very supportive. It had more of a sports type ride, a little harsher, than the Camry.

Finally I drove a 2003 Toyota Camry. The ride and interior were very similar to the 2000 Camry that we had driven about 30 minutes prior. I figured out what I didn't like about the Camry interior: The "Old Man" styled dash. It's like just one big piece of dash with no center console/control center. It reminded me of like an early 80's model Oldsmobile, and I was going to have no part in that. LOL

<b> More on the Accord (interior)</b>

So I decided to take another look at the Accord. Here are more particular's on the Accord itself. 

One thing that I really liked over the Camry, was the Accord's instrument panel. The gagues were nice and large and very easy to read. They were bright white on black with important stuff being red and green. The Camry's were much smaller and they were orange on black, which was acutally hard to see in the day time.

The radio/speaker system in the Accord was not as good as in the Camry, bass wise, but it was good enough for me. I listen to mostly talk radio anyways, so it's not that big of a deal to me.

There is more interior storage on the Accord than on the Camry.  I love having all the compartments to keep emergency money and other stuff in. The armrest has a 2 layer compartment. The top one is maybe 3/4" deep with change holders (very convenient) and underneath that layer is a much deeper, say 6", compartment where you can store like a cell phone, digital camera, and whatever else. There is also a nifty area right in front of the shifter where you can store CD's. 

Another kewl thing I like about the car is cupholders. They are built right into the center console in front of the armrest. No Cheapo filmsy fold/pull out cupholders here. These are actually molded into the console. It might be nice to have like a cover for when they aren't in use, but it's not a big deal.

The a/c system was easy to figure out. The ride quality is pretty good I think. It takes the usual assortment of road bumps and railroad tracks in stride. The amount of trunk space (14 cu ft) was quite surprizing to me. That was good to see, because I take a lot of road trips with friends, and you can never have too much trunk space. 

<b> More on the Accord (performance)</b>
For the car's real test, I drove it to a NYE party in Nashville last night (1.5 hours/90 miles from here).

The 160 HP/4 Cyl engine provided respectable acceleration and such on the merge ramps. Cruising the highway, there was road noise in the cabin, but not an objectionable amount at 75 mph. I didn't want to push the speed too much since it was after all, a major holiday and there were cops stationed about every 5 miles it seemed on I65 North bound.

Typically when I would make the drive to Nashville in either of my Nissan's, you could tell the seats really lacked lumbar support. Not the case with the accord. I was comfortable the entire way up and back. Very well constructed seats.

The fuel tank capacity is rated at 17 Gal and range of about 580 miles @ 34 mpg hwy. That's not too bad. 


<b> What I don't like </b>
The back end seems to be a bit higher than on my other cars, thus it's a little difficult to see out the back, when backing up. 

This is the first car I've owned where I can't see down the front of the hood. Not that it matters, but it's going to take some getting use to, "How close am I to that car in front of me?" kind of a thing.

I did prefer the exterior styling of the 2003 Camry over the 2003 Accord... However... you spend your time inside the car, not on the outside, hence the willingnesss to pay $1,000 more for the Accord which I feel had much better accomodations inside the vehicle.

Those non-issues really though.

<b> Conclusion </b>
After taking a short road trip the same day I got the car, I can't think of anything I did not like about it while driving it. It's fantastic!

In the past, I never had been a fan of Honda... but this car has changed my mind. There could very well be future Honda purchases.
