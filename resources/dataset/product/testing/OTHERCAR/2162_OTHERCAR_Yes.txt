            I bought this truck new in 1994 when the local dealer was having a big sale. I purchased a pretty basic S model, with only cloth seats and no exterior chrome trim, but I did get the V6 and a limited slip diff. 

The Isuzu is certainly reliable. I never had a single major problem during the time I owned it - about eight years and 50k miles.

The list of small problems is short, a leaky radiator hose, and noisy valve lifters when the engine was cold. The engine did develop a persistent oil leak after a dealer recall to service a plug in the rear of the cylinder head. It was pretty minor, so I never took it back to be repaired, but I wasn't impressed with the service department's work.

You should be aware that the Rodeo has pretty poor gas mileage, at best I was getting perhaps 18mpg, and the engine tended to use a quart of oil between changes, although this was pretty constant over the 50k miles I drove the vehicle.

One negative to consider is the manual 4wd that the 1994 was equipped with. In order to shift into 4wd, you must be stopped, and to shift out, you have to stop, shift out of 4wd, and then back up 3 feet or so. This isn't a big deal if you are in snow for long periods, but where I live, snow is usually only encountered over ridges, followed by long descents on plowed roads. Of course, you can just leave it in 4wd, but that takes a toll on the tires and the drivetrain, as the parts all scrub against one another, due to slight differences in the speeds at which the individual wheels turn. So, I wouldn't recommend this car as a ski vehicle to someone who lives in California or Washington.

I eventually sold the vehicle because ultimately it was not enough of a truck to function as a truck, and a little too unrefined to be a car, as well as a gas hog. For my purposes, I prefer to have two vehicles that are each dedicated to the function that they perform best. However, if the wallet is a little tight, the Isuzu won't disappoint you.

Be warned that the vehicle is not as sure-footed in slippery conditions as you might expect a four wheel drive vehicle to be. The rear end is much lighter than the front and it's easy to snap it around. I've been sideways twice, once on black ice at 50mph+ and once in slush at 30+ and although both occasions had happy endings, I would hesitate to recommend this car to an inexperienced driver.

Any tappet noise should be investigated when purchasing the car. Definitely listen to a running cold engine. I have heard other complaints about this, and it appeared to worsen over time. In fact, I sold the car to a friend who then left his wife and ran away to Thailand (a long story), leaving the car parked at my house for a year. When he returned, the tappets were so loud, we both thought major surgery was in order. However, he added a bottle of Rislone to the engine, and the noise cleared right up. This was surprising to me, because I always assumed that engine additives were complete snake oil, but it really did the trick in this case.

To sum up, check the tappets, be aware of the gas mileage and handling issues in the slippery stuff, and if none of that dissuades you, then buy this truck.
