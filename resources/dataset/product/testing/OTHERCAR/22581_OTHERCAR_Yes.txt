            It was the summer of 1997 a summer I will not soon forget because it was the summer I finally got a car. And not just any car but a 91 Pontiac Firebird. I chose the Firebird mainly for its look, with its sleek areodynamic lines, the stock wing on the trunk, and the ground effects kit this car looked sweet. but not only did it look like a sports car it handled like one. My Firebird has a 2 inch drop so going over speed bumps and into driveways was a delicate operation at times, but when you had a clear windy road the benefits of better handling and cornering become apparent. Slapping some Yokohama tires on the stock 15" rims proved to be a wise investment as the added grip of these high performance tires is instantly noticible when driving. But I was still a bit dissapointed about the mere 140 horses coiming out of my 3.1 liter engine. So inorder to get a bit more power out of my car I added a hypertech PROM to the Electronic Control Module located under the passengerside dash at a cost of $185. The new chip also came with a 130 degree thermostat which kept my engine running at around 150 degrees while the chip helped to pump my horse power up to around 160. Chopping off the OEM muffler and adding a flowmaster not only gave the car a nicer growl but helped me reach the 170 horse power mark. So with just those few minor modifications to the car I took it to Sears Point for bracket racing. Bracket racing is a quarter mile drag race against the clock, a drivers reaction time and actuall quarter mile time combine to give you the total time, thus a driver with a fast car but a bad reaction time will lose to a slow car with a driver who can get off the line faster. My car posted a 16.2 with a .4 second delay on my part on my first run (thats a pretty bad reaction time), and a 15.9 with a .2 second delay on my part the second run (.2 is closer to the average reaction time). Not the fastest car on the road, but definitely faster then your average commuter scooter.
