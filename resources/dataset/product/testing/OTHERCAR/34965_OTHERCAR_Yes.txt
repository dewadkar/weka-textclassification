              I own two Pontiac Grand Prix's one is a 1993 and one is a 1992.  My wife's car the 1992 is a family car very plain Jane and very low key.  The car usually needs to go to the shop about once a year with a problem in the transmission.  We have had it replaced 2 times for a cost of $300.00 and $150.00 the second time around.  Besides this little problem the car has performed well for getting the wife and kids back and forth to work and school.  
  Now, my car the 1993 Grand Prix.  It is the SE edition with the lower aerodynamics package put on in Kansas City.  I have not had any problems with this vehicle.  It is very dependable looks sporty and it is very comfortable on long trips.  I have drove the vehicle as much as 100 miles in a week to 2500 miles in a week (Florida Vacation).  Pontiac's red illumination in the dash compliments the interior while driving at night.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone even if you have small children.  There is plenty of room in the rear seat to accommidate 2-3 screaming children.  It is even easy to put infants in the rear seat due to the design of the Grand Prix not like the 1982 Trans Am.  This is also the #1 vehicle that I see young mothers driving when dropping off their children at school.  With the sporty design of the vehicle and the horsepower Dad's will also love the car too.  Just look at me I liked my wife's so much I went out and bought a newer sporty model and enjoy the convenience of the comfortable family cruiser and the acceleration of a sporty looking vehicle.  The car is loaded with every power option available for the year produced and I still have not had any problems with the car.  <br><br>
