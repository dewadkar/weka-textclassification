            When I decided to trade in my Jeep Wrangler for a Jeep Cherokee, it was the best choice I have made in a while.  It is a very smooth ride on or off road.  

Some of the good things about my Jeep Cherokee is that it can fit 5 people comfortably.  It is also a very comfortable SUV wherever you sit in it.  It came with four good speakers, so the audio is very nice.  It is a very easy SUV to drive, in that it handles very well.  

When I take my Jeep off-road, it does a very good job keeping up with all the big trucks and Wranglers.
