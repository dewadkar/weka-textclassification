            I have to say I bought my JGC with expectations of unreliability but so far I'm pleased.  Chrysler never impressed me in the past but I wanted an SUV that fit my needs.  I drove the Toyota 4 Runner and I didn't like the price for what I got, The Nissan Pathfinder and a few others.  I felt I received a roomier vehicle with much more power for a lot less cash than the imports.  

Some minor issues have occurred including a dead starter, some funny noises, and a rusted stabilizer but that's about all.  I recommend the 16 inch wheels over the 17 inch.  The 17 inch tires/rims look great but are pricey to replace (I shredded one).  I'm picky about quality having worked in manufacturing for years.  One other thing that caught my attention was the trim around the sunroof held in with rubber cement (??).  What were they thinking??

I use this vehicle everyday and I like it.  I also tow a heavy 19 foot boat and the Jeep with a tow package works well for this purpose.  The gas mileage drops to about 12.5/GA when towing.  The 8 cyl has more than enough poop to get out of it's own way.  I've owned other SUVs and this has been the best to date. Off road and in the snow it does well.

I have had limited experience with the Service departments.  Oil changes take for ever at Lawless Jeep in Woburn MA.  IRA in Lowell has their act together and have been very helpful.  The attention to service was a real surprise to me.  

I'd buy this vehicle again if the pricing is still as good.
