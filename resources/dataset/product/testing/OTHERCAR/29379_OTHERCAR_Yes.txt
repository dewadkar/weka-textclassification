            After my 1995 Chrysler Cirrus' transmission began to die for the umpteenth time, I vowed that I'd never buy one of their beautiful but impotent and repair-prone vehicles ever again.  In fact, that car had broken down so frequently that I was soured on ALL American vehicles -- irrationally or not.

Everyone I know who's owned a Toyota, Honda, or Nissan over the years have praised their vehicles' comparative reliability and ease-of-ownership.

After placing a battery of calls to the Chicagoland Honda and Toyota dealerships, and only finding a few models -- both new and used -- with the preferred V6 engine, I settled on a Toyota-Certified White 1999 Avalon XLS.  Two months later, I'm still very happy with it.

The Avalon is Toyota's top-of-the-line model. It is a big, comfortable sedan that feels quick on its feet. It is hard to tell just by looking at it, but the Avalon handles well and delivers a satisfying ride.  It's practical, but it is appointed with luxurious leather seats, handsome seven-spoke aluminum wheels, and an excellent sound system that rivals almost anything you can buy for your home. For $13,000, I can't complain.  It had 58,000 miles on it...but it's a Toyota -- cars which legendarily run well over 200,000 miles.  (If you're gonna buy a Toyota, make sure you get a model that's certified for bumper-to-bumper warranty coverage of either 6 years after manufacture date or 100,000 miles.)

Two models of Avalon are available: XL and XLS.  Like I said, I got the deluxe XLS.  However, both models utilize Toyota's 3.0-liter V6. This engine produces 210 horsepower with 220 pounds-feet of torque, and you can feel it.  Very nice for a boat-like land vehicle.

XL models come fully equipped with side air bags, dual-zone air conditioning, power windows, door locks and mirrors, and a 120-watt AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players. XLS models add automatic climate control, a driver information display (compass, trip computer, outside temperature and calendar functions), fog lights, aluminum alloy wheels, remote keyless entry, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. 

All this being said, the Avalon isn't much to look at.  Frankly speaking, it's an old man's car.  If you're goal is to get laid, look elsewhere (although the leather backseat is fantastic). However, If you want to travel in comfort and safety while going unnoticed, this is the car for you.

The Avalon is roomy inside and provides plenty of shoulder room. The front seat is easy to get in and out of, and the low front cowl provides a nice view of the road ahead. 

The rear seat also offers good visibility and legroom. However, high windowsills make the chamber feel deep.  You'll feel like you're sitting in a high-chair for the first few weeks. Carrying of long, narrow objects is made easier as the rear center seat has a pass-through that opens up to the trunk. 

The leather is plush, in beige. The feel of the leather, the doses of walnut, the big recessed instrument panel, and especially the inside shape of the C-pillars, all make the Avalon interior reminiscent of a Cadillac.

While Avalon's are reputed to have a very quiet cabin, mine does tend to emit a rattling from the dash area.  I'm sure I could get that taken care of, but it's not something that bothers me immensely...and sometimes it disappears altogether.

The ride is flawless.  This is a great sedan, though it seems like the dignified styling could use a bit of swoop or flash to match the performance.  But I'm very happy!
