            I bought my Monte Carlo SS for the same reason I bought all of my former sports cars, performance.  I have in the past owned several different.  From the '81 Firebird, and the '84 Camaro to the '81 MG. and a couple of others not worth mentioning.  They were all fun to drive.  They were the latest styles at the time and a very popular car.  The Monte Carlo only varies in one aspect from the above.  I mean, it looks great, performs well, and drives spectacularly.  But its something more.  The Monte Carlo is alot more safe to drive.  You can still have high performance (when the kids aren't with you) with this car and still have a car that truly holds the road.  No hydroplaning, no spinning on a wet surface, or on icy roads.  I found the traction system really works during our latest ice storm..   I do not recommend driving on icy roads unless absolutely an emergency, but at least I had a little more security with this car.  I am not trying to say that this car or any other type of vehicle, is completely safe on icy roads because they are not.  

The look, the design (interior, and exterior), and the affordability of this car is what I love about this car.  Dont forget about the above mentioned.

The only thing I can think that I might hate about this car, is the fingerprints.  lol.  Everytime I go into a store I come back out with someone with their hands on the windows looking in.  I get all kinds of people asking me about the car.  Which could be great if you were single.  lol

Anyone young at heart should buy this car.  And if your not young at heart and want to remember what that feels like, this is the car for you.
