            We have owned the Sony FD71 for almost 3 years.

During this time we have "snapped" thousands of pictures with it.  The floppy storage system works well for us - a box of floppy diskettes is nearly free these days, and the diskettes can be used repeatedly.

In normal resolution we have gotten as many as 45 pictures on a single floppy.  In hi-res, we commonly get over 20 on a single floppy.  The floppy disk system is very convenient for transferring files to your PC, and offers virtually unlimited storage capacity - just pack another box of diskettes in your camera bag.

The ease of use is great.  We love the 10x zoom and the large viewfinder.  The camera features many special effects, including sepia, negative, pastel, b&w, color, indoor, outdoor, etc.

We purchased an optional Sony battery with greater capacity than the one that came with the camera.  We usually pack both batteries and the charger when we go on a trip, and therefore have never had a problem with dead batteries.

Be prepared:  when carrying the camera, extra battery & charger, and several boxes of floppy diskettes, the load can get heavy.

Low-light photography with this camera is not very rewarding. Also, the flash often tends to wash out subjects
all too often.  In medium to bright light, the quality of pictures is acceptable.

We purchased an optional wide-angle lens which has proven to be quite handy.  Sony also markets a macro lens for this camera; however, we have yet to purchase it.  

NOTE:  We collect coins as a hobby, and have used the FD71 (without a macro lens) to take close-up pictures of some coins. The pictures will often reveal details that the naked eye can miss.
