            I purchased my 1988 SAAB 900 turbo 8/99.  Having previously owned two VOLVO's, I thought I was prepared for what I thought to be another typical, Swedish car.  I couldn't have been more incorrect.  This is hands down the most entertaining car I've ever driven.  The performance is unmatched in this class, the torque surprisingly powerful @ 188 ft/lbs, and the handling the best I've ever experienced.  The turbo model is definitely the choice model.  I was also surprised w/ the exceptional build quality, but would expect nothing less from an aircraft builder. Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) has also been building airplanes for almost a century.  Now for the downsides, and there are several.  Anyone who has ever enjoyed SAAB ownership has come to realize the car's excellent performance was also overshadowed by the high cost of shop service.  Fortunately I was quite primed for this after both VOLVO's (and the fact that I perform most overhauls myself) but many would certainly feel ill at the thought of what most BOSCH components cost, and the rate which most foreign repair shops assess per each hour of their labor.  The suspension of all SAABS, turbo's in particular, are also a bit stiffer than most, due to the fact that these cars were bred for a European nation where the roads are table smooth.  This is fine though as it  enables the driver to be more receptive of the actual road conditions.   All in all, I feel that @ $2700, my shiny blk 3dr turbo was a hell of a deal, and has repaid me w/ countless moments of driving pleasure.<br><br>
