            I decided to give Pontiac another chance when I bought my 1997 Grand Am.  I had a 1989 Grand Am for seven years and I loved the way it handled, the way it looked, and the pick-up was not too bad.  After only 50,000 miles it blew a head gasket that cost me $800.  So I thought it might just be that car since I heard that many people like their Grand Ams.  So I bought a new '97.  I thought that in 8 years they may have made some improvements. I have had that car in the shop over 6 times in 3 years to replace many rotors and one drum.  I have gotten no response from General Motors about reimbursement.  I would not recommend that anyone buy a Grand Am simply because I would be afraid of what may go wrong.<br><br>
