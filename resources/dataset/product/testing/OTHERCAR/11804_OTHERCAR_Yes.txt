            I bought my 1998 Esteem Wagon new. It was only $12,000 in Orlando, FL. It now has 33,000 miles on it, has never been back to the dealer, nothing has broken or needed work. This is the base model w/o power locks or windows. I wanted a practical 4 cylinder, 5 door vehicle, with manual transmission and almost bought the Ford Escort wagon, but a friend's trouble free experiences with another Suzuki and minor detail differences made me chose the Esteem. I'm hard pressed to come up with any secondary cons, but in the interest of brutal honesty, here are things that might be significant to others: few dealers, tight driver's seat for the extra large or over 6 ft crowd (I'm 6', 210lbs, and fit fine), back seat not comfortable for adults. After living with it for 3 years, I would buy another. I'm convinced the people designing and assembling Suzuki automobiles in Japan are trying to do a very good job and make the end purchaser happy with their product. What a concept!
