            My commute to work hasn't been long enough since I bought this car!

I purchased my 1998 Eclipse GSX about a year ago and have been in love with it since. I paid $18,400 for the car. I also looked at the '00 Acura Integra, '00 Honda Prelude, '00 Toyota Celica, and at '00 Mitsubishi Eclipses. This was my clear choice though after test driving and researching all of them

First the pro's: It came with 17&quot; wheels, leather seating, moon roof, infinity sound system (CD/tape deck/6 speakers), a huge spoiler and of course, a TURBO and ALL WHEEL DRIVE. The turbo (even though it's an automatic and is a smaller turbo then what comes in the standard transmission cars) is very peppy (you will start to feel it kick in at around 2,500 RPM and after that it gets stronger and stronger...)Combine that with all wheel drive and you have the perfect combination. Those SUV drivers don't know what they're missing, this is the only type of all wheel drive car I will ever own! This car hugs turns amazingly! Whenever I have a bad day I take out my car on some back country roads and within minutes I've got a smile glued to my face. And I have to mention how many looks I get in this car. It's aggressive styling draws people's attention immediatly! The car spends very little time in the shop, so far only routine check ups.

The con's: The interior is very small, my 6' boyfriend complains whenever he gets in it. I wouldn't advise people much taller then that to attempt to get in this car, he drives a 1998 3000GT which is a much better fit if you're of the tall variety. There is a substantial amount of road noise and the suspension is pretty hard (but what do you want out of a sport's car) Also visibility is not the best, that huge spoiler makes the rear view mirror pretty useless most of the time, and the blind spot on the side of the car is huge. And finally....the insurance. I live in New Jersey, which in and of itself is a bad thing when it comes to insurance prices. But this car is definetly on the high side, I would advise consulting with your insurance agent before purchasing. 

In conclusion: Even with the con's I still love this car. It makes me happy which is in my opinion the most important factor, especially considering how much time I spend in the car each day.<br><br>
