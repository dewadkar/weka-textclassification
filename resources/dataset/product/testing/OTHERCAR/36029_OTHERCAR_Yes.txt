            Alright, everybody talks about how Saab's are unreliable, and in the shoppe all the time.  I have only had my Saab 900s for about 2 weeks, but so far it is awesome.  

The exterior:
- Great looks, long enough wheel base, looks different than all other cars
- Saab 900s  come wiht bad rims on the wheels, i would recommend getting new ones!
-FOG LIGHTS!

The Interior:
- Awesome computer system, with differnt info available on the screen, like MPG, temparture, and how many miles left on the takn.
-Heated seats are standard, in already really comfortable seats
-Good dash layout, Great visiblity through the windshield
-Very roomy, even in the backseat, MORE than most hatchbacks
-BAD cupholdrrs, you'd have to be a backseat driver to use it
-Windshield wiper controls can be tricky

The Engine:
- The 900s with out Turbo is a little sluggish, but with sport mode on it moves!  I was used to a 1985 BMW 5 series with a v6, so its a big difference
-Great ABS brakes

More extras:
-Saabs have a winter mode on them, that is awesome in heavy snow, im from UPstate ny, so i know how to use it

Overall- Used Saabs are a great value for the used price that they sell at, although mine is 6 years old it was a very low price, remembers it's a SAAB.  They look great, run great, and you feel very safe in these cars
Airbags are standard, along with everything else one would want in a car, I would recommend this car if you want a safe, awesome car to drive, but MAYBE go for the turbo, yo
