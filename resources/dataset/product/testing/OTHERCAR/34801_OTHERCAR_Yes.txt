            Hi There,

Overall, I like my Montero Sport.  Good visibility for making lane adjustments and for viewing the road ahead (as well as over) the cars in front of me...I like that.  :)

The paint job holds the finish very well.  I need to purchase a cargo cover as well as a front-end bug deflector.  The handling on cloverleaf off ramp turns is good, but not like a car.  The underbody has good heavy steel.  The body height is good, but a side step (rail preferably) would be advantageous.  :)

With some enhancements, I'm getting about 24 MPG on the highway, that's good.  My best add-on was the JC Whitney Fuel Enhancer.  If you like, see the following URLs for ideas on V-6 3.0 L engines.
