            Bought new in 1996, would not drive anything other than SUV now. Only thing I would change is I think it should have a &quot;cargo cover&quot; to cover the area in the back in case you have packages or something that you don't want to be seen. Other than that, it's a great SUV. Lots of pick up and go. Not GREAT on gas mileage, but probably pretty good for this type of SUV or anything this size. Backseat is uncomfortable for adult size person. Has window locks on drivers side so no one can roll down the windows other than driver. Also has child lock doors in back, which are good if you have little ones. Cup holder is not made very well, broke after first couple of years and not very steady. This is a very fun SUV to drive and goes pretty fast before you know it. Sets up high and you feel safer in it than a car. Will never drive another car again. <br><br>
