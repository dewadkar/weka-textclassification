            Four years ago we purchased a 1990 Dodge Caravan because our family expanded with the addition of a foster child.
Before signing the purchase agreement I made sure to have in writing that the replacement of the transmision would be at the cost of the dealership. My reason for this was because during the test drive I kept hearing a clunking noise which bothered me. The dealership agreed and so we purchased the Van. Six months down the road we were replacing the transmision.

All was fine for about a year, with regular oil changes etc. we believed we made a good purchase. It was not long when the engine started blowing blue exhaust, pinging from the valves, and overheating.

Repairs were made to the radiator, seals replaced tune ups etc.
We still have blue smoke, and particularly when the van idles at stop lights or after warming up in the winter months. 

The funny thing is that when I look around when driving I see many other Dodge Caravans doing the same thing. When talking to my mechanic I find out the problem is very common with the Caravans, and aside from sinking a fortune into having the engine completly overhauled there is not much I can do.
