            I recieved this camera as a gift from my aunt. She had paid about $600 canadian for it at the sony store. I really didn't want it because I was looking at a 3.1 megapixel kodak camera, but she insisted this was the better choice. She turned out to be right. 

On the way home I unpacked the camera and tried to get it working. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries, a charger, the camera, cables, manuals and a warranty card. The only thing that did not come with it was a plug-in power source, but that was extra. The charger was also a "slow" model that took over 8 hours. The turbo charger which was extra only took 2 hours. 

I put the batteries in and tried to set the camera up but I found the batteries to be almost dead. I went home and got them charged. That night I tried the camera for the first time. 

This camera is great! It not only has many features, but it is almost manual (but not fully manual). It does not have a macro mode but I can take pictures with the camera only about half an inch away from the subject. The zoom is quite good, but I found if I wanted a good picture, I should not take pictures when zooming with the digital enhancement because the pictures turn out blocky. 

The pictures on the camera's largest setting (1600 x 1200) can be printed nicely at 8x10 and can probably be printed larger with some optimization. The camera also has a movie mode which I found quite fun, and alot of people I showed the camera to were quite amazed. 

I uploaded a picture I took with the camera and you can find that at http://lonewolf451.tripod.com/Flower2.jpg. As you can see the image quality and colors are beautiful! I will be keeping this camera until I start to do professional photos and then will switch to a Digital SLR camera.
