            When I met the man who would be my husband, he had a 1992 Isuzu Pickup. We had it until family matters demanded we get a Sedan (see my review of the 2000 Saturn SL1 4 Door). I have referred to it as the little pick up that could. It has taken us from Jacksonville to Kansas City and back again several times, plus to many other destinations. 

We had the most basic of the basic, no comfort features- manual all the way. But it had a good little radio, and the vehicle itself ran beautifully. 

It is a dependable little car. My husband paid $10,000.00 for it NEW. OUr friend just bought one for $4,000.00, and he says it is a very dependable little truck. It gets you where you want to go, and is good for some hauling- although if you're one to haul a lot of stuff at one time I would suggest something with a bigger bed. 

So for an affordable used pick up, this is definitely one to consider for it's dependability and value. We had ours for eight years and had no problems with it, except for minor things that were my husband's fault. You just have to be sure to do preventative maintenance-- if you take care of your vehicle, it will take care of you.

This vehicle is not for those who want a lot of gadgets, and power this  and power that- it is a basic pick up for people with basic needs.
