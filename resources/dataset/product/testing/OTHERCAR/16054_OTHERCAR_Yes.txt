            This car is fully loaded.  It comes with cruise control, leather seats, power windows, power seats, power sun roof, power mirror, wood trim, CD/tape/radio, and premium sound for the interior.  In addition you get anti theft feature and alloy wheel.  If you want more, you can take a look at the premium edition.  The premium edition has all the features I mentioned above plus heated front seats and traction control.

I fell in love with this car the first time I saw it.  Its elegant design from "head to toe" captured my eyes.  I couldn't stop gazing at its beauty.  Gazing from afar is one thing, but sitting inside and driving it is another. Driving this car gives you a sense of control, for it is very stable and highly reliable.  All instruments are within your reach, especially if you want to adjust your seat.  The seat is adjustable electronically, so you can still drive safely and comfortably while you are adjusting your seat.  You can lean on your seat while your hand reaching for the cd/tape/radio.  If you want to adjust the mirror, it's easy, just reach on your left side and you can adjust your mirror electronically.  Its 3200 cc engine gives you great horse power, so it's so easy if you want to speed.  The only thing I don't like is driving this car when snowing.  Somehow, in the snowy road, the break doesn't cooperate too well, and it doesn't maneuver very well. Actually for this kind of car, I expect more even during snowing season.

Due to its sporty but elegant design, young executives might want to consider this car.  But if you are older you might want to consider the RL.  Acura has another type for younger and more dynamic drivers, that is the integra.  The class of the car shows how high the maintenance cost is.  You might want to consider it before buying.

One other suggestion that I think is good to be thought of by Acura is the one touch power window for the driver.  For the driver's side, Acura provides a one touch comfort if the driver wants to open the window, but I would suggest a one touch comfort also if the driver wants to close the window, so the driver's hand can be free while the window is closing.

Overall, I love this car.
