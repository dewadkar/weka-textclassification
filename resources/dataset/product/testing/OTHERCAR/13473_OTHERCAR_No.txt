                 Ever been rained on or sat in a puddle in your own car?  If not, you are lucky, because I drove a '92 Geo Metro Convertible for five years straight, and for the last two years I drove it, I was driving a swamp on wheels.  I fell for the low gas mileage and convertible top, this is my story...excited, even though I had never seen one.  We went to the dealership and I was hooked on it right away.  I test drove it, and the minute we got back to the lot, I asked the dealer to take the top down on 

     About six months after I got my drivers license, my mother was sick of me using her car all of the time, so she initiated a new car search for me.  We started looking at the Geo Metro because it was cheap and gas for it was cheap.  After a weekend of looking through the paper, we saw  an ad at a dealership that touted a convertible Geo Metro.  I was instantly the car.  I was hooked.  We bought it that night.

     I was teased to no end about the  car, because once I got it into the light, I realized that I had bought a girlie car.  A girlie car that had no power.  It was gutless, taking over 20 seconds to get from 0-60(no joke, I timed it on a quiet county road one day).  That was the least of my problems.  The car was flimsy, all the panels looked like they were plastic on the outside of the car, and all the ones inside were too, with some cheap-o plastic rivet things holding the panels together.  Not only that, since the car was an automatic, I only got about 30 miles per gallon, instead of the 50 per that a 5speed will get you.  Parts were hard to find because for some reason, Geo made everything measure out really obscure.  It took 3 weeks to find new wheels for it. 

     I had a million problems with the car, and it was in the shop for 3-4 times a year the first three years I owned it for non-maintainence related issues.  I had a timing belt break (at 32,000 miles) and destroy my engine on a mountain pass which required rebuilding the engine.  It didn't start on more than one occasion for no apparent reason, causing confusion among the mechanics.

     After the initial three years that I had it, it stopped being in the shop constantly.  I have no idea why, but it stopped having random problems.  I actually started to classify the car as reliable transportation.  Then, the roof started leaking.  The back window began to crack, exposing myself and my passengers to the elements.  No amount of duct tape could stop moisture from getting in.  Finally, while parked at a bicycle trail, someone used a knife to cut into the top of my car.  More duct tape and other futile attempts to stop the leakage were hopeless, and the passenger seat of my car was a lake.  

     I finally gave up and sold it for about $600 dollars in 1998, five years after I initially bought it.  For the love of God, don't make the same mistake I did.  2/3 of the Geo Metro Convertibles that I see on the road have back window problems, so it wasn't just me. It is good for all of the people that want fuel efficient cars that there are more options out there now(Prius and Insight), because the Geo is definatly not the way to go for a car.   <br><br>
