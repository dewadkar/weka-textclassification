            I bought a brand new Grand Am in 1991 for my first new car.  I bought this car because it was very affordable.  I just loved this car.  It was a 2 door with red paint and very sporty.  The only thing I did not like about this car later was that I didn't pay extra for tilt and cruise.  I was on a limited budget though - I was only 21.  The steering wheel was kind of high without any cruise.  My father got the windows tinted for me for my birthday and it looked really nice.  I moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City so I drove this car back and forth quite a bit.  I owned it for 5 years.  I never had any mechanical problems with it in this time.    

Only about 6 months before I decided to sell it did I have to start spending quite a bit of money to fix normal maintenance problems, including tires, battery, alternator, etc.  I really enjoyed driving my car and thought it was very dependable though.  I would recommend it to anyone for their first car.  <br><br>
