            Currently, I own two Saturns; 1992 SL (140,000 Miles)and a 1994 SL2 (90,000 Miles). Both cars have been great with respect to reliability. 
As far as repair history, I was terribly disappointed when my 92 needed a new alternator in 98 (125K). Not because I had to pay for a repair ($110), but because I could no longer say my Saturn was trouble free it's entire life. I replaced the Radiator the next summer at 132K miles. The small leak could have been repaired easily for a few bucks. I opted to replace it myself.  A brand new radiator was $157 delivered to my front door.  Plus another $30 for the hoses. The install was a piece of cake considering how small the cowling is and the fact that I have never replaced a radiator before (Total time about 3 hours I wasn't in a rush).

I have read other Epinions about the windows getting sticky,  My 92 had sticky windows, because I didn't open them often. I opened the door skins and lubricated the tracks with heavy water proof grease and they have been fine ever since. Keep in mind this happened after 7 years and 130K Miles.

My 94 has been a real pain in the butt as well, ya know gas every other week and oil every 3k it just never seems to get real exciting, and my mechanic stopped sending Christmas cards years ago. In fact the last time I spoke with him was just prior to buying the first one.  He said  &quot;Saturns were mechanical nightmaresï¿½ I don't recommend them&quot;.  Actually, a Saturn is a mechanic's nightmare.  

My wife and I are looking at the LS model for our next car, probably in the next year or so. 
Oh something else that is a comfort to hear, my 92 hit the highway divider at highway speeds, and cartwheeled off the wall. All four corners of the car were damaged, The steering wheel collapsed as did the seat to absorb impact.  The car was driven home from the accident and cost less about 3K to fix (happened in 1994)

My honest negative opinions:
The car is not very big, if you are larger in size you probably will have trouble getting in and out. On the older models like the two I own, there is no rain gutter and the rain just pours right in, even when the windows are only open a small amount (fixed in 1996).  Auto Seat Belts (Another thing Saturn has since fixed). The Oil filter is a little tough to get to (only a concern if you do your own oil changes).
