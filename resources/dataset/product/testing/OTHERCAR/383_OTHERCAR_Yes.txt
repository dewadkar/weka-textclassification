            I was one of the first to buy the Xterra where I live.  My 26 year old car crazy son said, &quot;It's the only SUV worth the money it costs.&quot;  He was 100% correct.  I love driving this truck and so does my wife.  We also own an s-10 Chevy Blazer but both prefer the Xterra.  We have a fully equipped XE 2wd 6cyl.  the only things I do not like about the vehicle are:  It could use a little more power,  The back seat is a pain to put down and you always have to find a place to put the seat bottom, and it could use more accessible storage areas in the front seat.  

This truck is much more fun to drive than the Chevy.  And we enjoy people turning their heads to see it ( and ours is dark green, not one of the stand-out colors that are available.)  The truck came pre-equipped with:  Tie down for our 2yo's car seat, a first aid kit, a trailer light hook-up, fog lights, and step rails; most of which are major extras in other trucks or are just not available.  The step rail has already protected my wife during an accident in which she was hit from the side.  The rail stopped the car that hit her, absorbed most of the shock and controlled the damage.

We are big believers and recommend the truck as a keeper<br><br>
