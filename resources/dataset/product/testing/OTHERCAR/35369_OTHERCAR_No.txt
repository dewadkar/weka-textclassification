            I urge anyone thinking of buying a 93 Eagle Talon, Don't do it!  I have spent thousands of dollars on repairs.  Among the major problems: timing belt flew off and bent the valves, cost of repair = $950.00. Blown engine happened at 80,000 miles = $2500.00.  These are only two of many problems, others range from engine knocking, to not starting at all.  To top things off, they refused to honor my 7 years or 70000 miles warranty.  I'm not the only one either, several friends of mine were forced to get rid of theirs, loosing lots of cash.  Everyone I've spoken too seems to believe that they a very problematic cars, including many different mechanics who have serviced my car during it's so called life. I reiterate, stay away from these cars!<br><br>
