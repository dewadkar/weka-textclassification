            I bought my first van, a Chevy Lumina, in 1990.  As a single woman at the time, I was tired of having to borrow both my friends' husbands and their trucks to haul my bulky stuff around.  So when it came time to buy a car, I opted for a van instead.  (Getting a husband wasn't quite that easy, but he came along a few years later...)

The Lumina died in late 1997, and by then, my husband and I were addicted to the convenience of being able to load it up and take off.  We'd been on a major driving and camping trip with it, and had done some extensive remodeling of our new old house.  So it never occurred to us to get anything other than another van.

We looked around at the Dodge and Japanese vans, but wound up with the extended 4-door Venture.

<b>What we like about it</b>

It's <b>big.</b>  It has enough <b>floor space</b> that we can haul 4' x 8' panels of drywall flat on the floor.  We have to tie the tailgate down because the panels extend a little beyond the sill, but they certainly fit, and the fact that we can load them flat onto the floor is a big plus for us.  Some of the other vans we looked at weren't wide enough.  We can also load our big bins full of camping equipment and take off - plenty of room for everything we need.  And we need a lot when we sissy-camp!

It has a <b>powerful motor</b>.  We got the 3.4 litre motor and it cruises along smoothly and comfortably under a full load.

We can <b>remove</b> all but the driver's and passenger's seats, so there's plenty of cargo space.

It seems self-evident, but we LOVE having a <b>door on the left middle row</b>.  My old Lumina didn't have one, and I could never figure out why.

There is a ridiculous number of <b>cup-holders</b> in this beast - I think I counted 14.  No way to lose a drink in here!

It's <b>quiet</b>.  We always roll up the windows when we drive on freeways so we can talk.  Aside from the usual loose rattles and squeaks that plague every car as it ages, there's very little noise inside the car with the windows closed.

You <b>can't run down the battery</b> by leaving the doors open.  The interior lights go off about five minutes after the doors are opened, and about ten minutes after the tailgate is opened.  We've given plenty of  jumps to other cars that had dead batteries because someone didn't notice that the door was standing open, so we really appreciate this feature.

Speaking of batteries, you can't run it down by forgetting to turn off the headlights, either.  The <b>lights</b> on this car are automatic.  The running lights come on when you start the motor and remain on as long as the ignition is on.  There's a small sensor on the dashboard that determines the ambient light levels and turns the headlights on and off accordingly.  You can override this system if you prefer to operate your headlights manually, but I love not having to think about them.  And I love not having to worry about forgetting to turn them off, which I have been known to do on occasion.

The <b>door-locks</b> engage automatically when you release the emergency brake. You can override them either manually at each door or with a switch in the driver's door, but it's nice to know that the tailgate is always locked when you're in the car.  The doors unlock automatically when you put the car in Park and turn off the ignition.

We can <b>remove or use the seats</b> in any of a number of configurations.  That flexibility comes in handy.

The seats are <b>comfortable</b>, although the flip-down arm-rests on the driver and passenger seats are pretty flimsy.  The passenger seat can be reclined almost flat, but the reclining mechanism isn't automatic - you have to twist a knob on the side of the seat.  (When I asked the dealer why it wasn't automatic, he gave me some song and dance about how you can adjust it exactly where you want it with the manual knob - as if you couldn't do that with a switch...)  The driver's seat has an <b>adjustable lumbar support</b>, and it moves back and forth and in two other directions via switches on the outside of the seat.  The backs of the rear seats flip down and have hard surfaces with cup-holders in them, so you can play cards in the back if you want to.  Unfortunately, the rear seats don't have arm-rests, so I wouldn't want to ride back there on a very long trip.  

The <b>warning lights are invisible</b> until they are needed.  You see them when you start the engine, but then they disappear so you aren't distracted by them.  So the instrument panel is pretty uncluttered.  All you see under normal running conditions when you look at the panel is the speedo, tach, and gas and heat gauges.

We average about <b>20 - 23 mpg</b>, year-round.  Naturally, it's lower during the hot days of summer when we have the AC going all the time, but the engine doesn't seem to suffer when we do.  We'd love to get 40 mpg, but we know we never will on a vehicle like this, and given its size and power, we're satisfied with this mileage.

<b>What we don't like about it</b>

I wish there were an <b>inside tailgate latch</b>.  If someone is riding back there, which they aren't supposed to but occasionally happens, they have to wait for someone to let them out, unless they want to climb over the rear seats.

The <b>horn</b> is hard to operate.  You have to put your hand flat against the top of the center panel on the steering wheel and then press it away from you.  It's stiff and hard to beep briefly if you want to let someone know they are about to back into you.  You have to press so hard that you get a big honk every time.  My little Miata has two indentations that you press very easily, and it's much easier to use the horn that way than this.

The <b>seat configuration</b> isn't very good.  For some reason, Chevrolet has never figured out that if you put in all the seats, seven total, there's no access to the back row.  That's because, unlike Chrysler Corp. vans, the middle row has three seats and the back row has two.  So if all three seats are in place in the middle, you can't get to the back ones without climbing over the backs of the middle ones.  Why not copy Chrysler and put two in the middle and three in back, so you can access them?  The Venture is bigger and wider than the Chrysler vans, so it ought to be possible.  In order to get the maximum use of the seats, we can only use six, so as not to block access to the rear row.

My old Lumina had seats that I could easily remove and replace by myself.  They were bulky but I could wrestle them into place without much trouble and they hooked into the floor pretty easily.  This Venture, though, has <b>seat latches</b> that were designed by the devil himself.  It is absolutely not obvious, as you're holding the seat above the floor, where to put the front hook so it will catch, and in fact, it appears that it <i>can't</i> possibly fit where it's supposed to.  And they have to hook in before you push the back of the seat down to latch the rear.  If it isn't in exactly the right place, the rear won't latch and you can't safely use the seat.  I have lost count of the number of times we have wrestled with these da<b></b>mn seats - sometimes we get the front hook in, sometimes we don't, and sometimes we try and try and then give up and then go back the next day and give it a push and - CLICK! - it slides right into place.  Whoever designed this system obviously worked for the competition!

As is the case with all the vans we looked at, the <b>rear windows are pop-out</b>, so they don't open very far.  At their widest, they only open about two inches at the far end.  For car-sick claustrophobics like me, that's not much.

Relative to the rear windows, the <b>window latches</b> are pretty poorly designed.  The one on the left side middle row keeps popping open - we had it replaced a month after we bought the car, and we've replaced it again  since then, with about 44K miles on the car to date.  It needs to be replaced again, but I refuse to keep doing without the car while it's in the shop, so I just tape it closed - really attractive!  A latch ought to be a pretty easy thing to design so it stays closed, and the excuse I get from the dealer, that I slam the door so hard it pops the latch, is nonsense.  I don't, and it shouldn't.

It's a small point, but the <b>clothing hooks</b> are virtually useless.  There's one behind each back door, so they aren't easy to get to, and they are so short and straight that they don't hold much.

<b>Summary</b>

You can get this van with a lot more bells and whistles than we got.  It comes with a feature that allows you to pop the doors and tailgate from a distance, which is handy if you're staggering under a load of kids and/or groceries.  We can unlock them, but not unlatch them.  (Latches again!)  

We love having a van, and got by far the best deal on the Venture, compared to what we were quoted for the other ones we looked at, all of which were smaller than this one.

Would we buy it again?  Overall, it's a well-designed and -engineered car, but more attention could have been paid to the details that would make it a terrific vehicle.  The poorly designed seat latches are a major factor for us, but we don't move the seats around that much.  It's like your roof - those leaks are major schreck, but only when it rains.  So overall, as frustrated as we get with them and the silly window latches, we're satisfied enough with the overall features and performance of the vehicle that we probably would.  But the silly latches prevent us from giving this car five stars.

But it sure would be nice if Chevy would brush up on latch technology!
