            I live in Southern California and I drive a lot.  I see a lot of Accords, Camrys and Altimas around.  But I also see a lot of Galants and I had my eye on them for a while.  I finally just got one this last weekend and I am happy to say that I love it.  First off I like the styling of the 03 model that I have, looks great has fog lights and is a big solid car.  Has everything you would expect like power windows, doors and even a automatic trunk release.  The trunk is huge and you you can fit a lot in it.  I am 6'4 and I actually used to have the Mitsubishi Lancer which was a decent car.  I fit in the car ok but this car fits me excellent with a lot of room left over.  The interior is nice, not fancy or anything but solid.  The radio is actually quite powerful and you can bump it without having to replace the speakers or anything.  It also has plug in adapters and I love that because my G/F and I have cell phones and we can plug them in at the same time not having to worry about fighting over it everytime we want to charge our phones.  The Glove box is big and can fit a lot of documents etc.  The power is pretty good, not super fast but not slow by any means.  If you want to punch it to get past cars/truck or annoying slow drives then this car can do it.  I tested out the back seat and I know other people complain that there is not as much room as other big cars, but I found it to be quite comfortable fitting my 6'4 frame.  My only grip is the gas mileage around the streets is not all that good but its better on the highway/freeways.  I think it gets around 21, 22mpg on the streets and 26-28 on the Freeway.  I drive on the freeway more than anything and I did not notice much of a decrease from my lancer I had before that got 24 street 30 highway. All in all this is a great alternative to a honda/camry car.  It looks great, drives great and you won't be dissapointed.
