            Take an old pro who has used most of the world's best cameras ( Leica, Contax, Linhof, Nikon, Canon and Olympus) and buy him his first digital camera, and this is what you get.

First look, new and right out of its package... first impression: flimsy.
Yes, this little plastic wonder does not radiate confidence that it will last very long under professional use. It weighs next to nothing and except for the word, &quot;Olympus&quot; in bright silvery letters and the word, &quot;Camedia&quot; in red, the rest of it is midnight black. 

It comes with a set of lithium batteries (non-rechargable) and a wafer sized infra-red remote control. You will also find three (3) instruction booklets, one each for English, Spanish and French. Each one of these booklets are 223 pages thick and believe me, you are going to need one of them to study every word.  This camera's secrets are available through push button programming via 9 buttons and one 5 position dial. These controls govern the whole gambet of the camera's many capabilities which you can read in full within the instruction book. 

Before you can learn to program all functions of the camera, you may find that you may run down batteries faster than a corn husker's convention shucking husks. I chose to save the exepensive lithium batteries for a time when I would need serious use, and I began using  sets of Nicads I had on hand. A fully charged set of Nicads will only last 20 minutes if you are exercising the camera while learning its functions. Olympus recommends AA sized nickel metal hydride batteries and these will give you good service and are rechargable.

In the learning phase, you might like to buy an AC supply so that you can run the camera as long as you like, but once you are passed the testing stage, it is likely you will be satisfied to rely on the hydrides. The camera uses 4 of these AA batteries and I find that buying two sets (8 cells) you will probably be able to cover a lot of shooting with one set charging and  the other set in the camera. Make no mistake, this is a power hungry machine.

The controls of this camera are ergonomically easy to use but the sequence of button pushing is more awkward than any film camera ever made. you will have to concentrate and learn to go through several levels of button pushing to crank up features you want to use or NOT use. 

Having said all this, let me now say that this camera is absolutely amazing. I find it extremely accurate and it does some things impossible for film cameras to duplicate. For instance, the panorama feature seamlessly assembles up to ten frames of exposures to make views that stagger the imagination. A full 360 degrees is easy to do. Part of this operation is done in the caamera and part of it is done in the computer by the supplied software. This featurte ONLY works with the OLYMPUS Smart Card in the camera. This is the 16 megabyte card that comes with the camera. Additional cards maybe purchased but are quite expensive ($100 for a 32 Meg. Smart Card.

I do not like the lens projecting out from the camera when the power is turned on. The plastic barrel surrounding the lens when it extends is a loosly fitting and cheap looking device that makes the camera look like it came out of a Cracker Jack box... hardly resembling a camera that costs nearly a thousand dollars. In fact the whole camera looks  like cheap junk, but yes, it does do everything it is advertised to do. 

Experimentally, I enlarged  one high resolution frame to 16&quot; x 20&quot; scale (cropped to 8.5&quot; X 11&quot;) and was quire pleased with the resultant photograph. I think once I become more adept at programming this camera I would not hesitate to use it professionally.  

But this camera is not for everyone. Most casual users will probably never want to disable the flash, or over ride the automatic features which is precisely why I wanted this camera. If only automatic features are wanted,one would do better by buying a simpler digital camera that would be easier to set up. For me, I like to be able to do side lighting with strobes, I like to shoot existing light, I like to do bounce lighting, and I like to &quot;fudge&quot; exposures for dramatic effects. I also like to shoot in black and white and yes, this camera can do that and sepia too. Photos in black and white make splendid, full tone scale prints, razor sharp at 8&quot; X 10&quot;  and with software... amazing possiblities are available.  I don't think I can ever give this camera up. It's great.
