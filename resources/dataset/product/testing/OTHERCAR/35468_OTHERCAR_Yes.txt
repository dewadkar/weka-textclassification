            My first digital camera was the Kodak DC20, an antique by today's standards. Others followed, but I never got the quality I desired. When looking for a new camera I wanted to be able to take great pictures, have Sony quality and innovation and be fully automated when I want to take snaps but have good manual overrides.

The F707 has all of these features -- in a rather unusual package.  At first it looks as though it's all lens, but if you remove the battery you'll realize that a lot of electronics must also reside in its "nose". Others have commented about how to hold it, etc. so I won't elaborate here.

Sony needs to get competitive with its Memory Stick technology, though, and ship the camera with at least 32 (and preferably 64)MB. I bought my camera with a 128MB stick and the first night out with it filled up the camera with still images and a few HQ MPEG files that I can e-mail to my family. The word is that Sony is looking at boosting the capacity of the memory stick.

The quality of the pictures is phenomenal, and I printed some out right away on 8 1/2 x 11 PLAIN paper.  Color saturation seems good and the Carl Zeiss lens obviously demonstrates its quality.

Battery life is good - I got several hours continuous use (w/o flash). Still, I recommend you get a second battery to have on hand just in case.

Some features are ones I don't care about - like sepia coloring, as I can use the supplied software to do any effects. The 3-burst shot is handy - at an ice hockey game I was able to easily get face-off shots by shooting just before the puck was dropped.  Exposure bracketing is also an option.

Ease of use is fantastic - although the manual is the typical Sino-English translation most things are intuitive, especially if you already own a Sony DV camera as I do.  

After a few hours of using this camera I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a quality camera - as long as you understand this won't fit in your pocket!

Update 4/19 - after registering online, I received a $20 off eCoupon from SonyStyle.com - I used this toward the carrying case (LCSFX) which arrived today.  Unlike most cases, this one is specifically designed for this camera, which has one major benefit and one major disadvantage.... it carries the camera, memory sticks (about 2 extra) and an extra battery -- but looks like a handgun holster, which isn't probably the best visual effect to have these days. It holds the camera snugly and I feel much more secure in toting my camera around now.

Also recommended - get a clear or UV filter right away after getting the camera (any standard 58mm model should work - I got SunPak UV and polarizing filters on eBay for $20). This will help protect the lens from scratches, dust, etc., and it's much cheaper to replace if you drop or break it.

More usage comments - during a company function recently I went around and took some pictures of staff "in action", printing them on glossy stock. People could not believe that the images came from a digital camera.  Great job Sony!
