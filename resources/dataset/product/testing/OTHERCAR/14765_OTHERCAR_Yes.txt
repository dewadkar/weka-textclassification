            I had wanted an SUV for years. I couldn't afford one when I was single and of course when we first got married we couldn't then either. I was so tired of driving cars. I was jealous of everyone driving a SUV. We tried to buy a Blazer one year a few years back, $525 a month, yeah right! Back then that was like asking for a million dollars.  So again I had to settle for a car. It was a nice car but it wasn't a SUV.

My husband surprised me on our anniversary  a couple of years later, he told me we were getting "me" a SUV of some kind. We drove a Blazer, two Jeep Cherokees and an Explorer. Then we happened upon this 1997 Mercury Mountaineer at the Ford lot. The salesman was great and the deal was good. The truck drove better than any of the rest of them and this guy's deal was a lot better. We ended up paying about $12,000 for it.
I do not have this SUV anymore because I had to have something with a third seat but I want to tell you about it because I loved it.

It was burgandy with gray molding that ran all the way around the bottom. It had running boards and gray cloth interior. It also had tilt and cruise at the touch of a fingertip. It had all wheel drive and it works great on the snow and ice that we had been experiencing. It has dual air bags, AM/FM cassette, power door locks and windows. You can lock and unlock all the doors from the back. By that I mean in the back when you put groceries or what have you there is a button to unlock or lock the doors, I thought that was cool. When I got my groceries out I just hit the button in the back to lock all the doors. It has a rear wiper and rear defroster.

The seats are very comfortable for long rides and are adjustable, incase you want to lay back and snooze. The steering wheel had some kind of cushioning on it, very nice. There was always plenty of leg room. It had awesome sound from the radio or tape deck, you could adjust the speakers in case someone was sleeping.

It was actually really good on gas. I don't know the exact mileage but i filled it up once a week and I did a lot of city driving. I had to pick kids up at and drop them off at 2 different schools. The schools were out in the county one on one side one on the other, so I did a lot of driving during the week.

The kids loved it. They would  hop in at school in the afternoons and the backpacks go over the backseat. People say they are just like the Explorer. They are not, they are better. I drove an Explorer, the Mountaineer is better quality.

My sister-in-law and I went and bought bikes for the kids for that Christmas, I laid the seats down in the back and put 5 bikes in the back. I couldn't believe it 5 bikes, my husband didn't believe it either when I told him. I am a Girl Scout Leader and I loaded up $2000 worth of cases of peanuts without putting the seats down. The Mountaineer is amazing, it does everything.

It rides great, I think it rides better than my old car. I thought the big tires would make it ride rough but it rides smooth. I'm not afraid to drive on icy roads with it. I recommend the Mercury Mountaineer to everyone. It is roomy and can haul anything you want to put back there. It even pulled a 2 ton car trailer, my husbands truck can't do that.

I loved the Mercury Mountaineer maybe I&#146ll get another someday. Someday meaning when I don&#146t have to haul everybody&#146s kids everywhere along with mine. Until then I guess I&#146ll have to stick to my mini-van, which I will write about eventually because I really love it also.

Thanks for reading and Happy Holidays!
