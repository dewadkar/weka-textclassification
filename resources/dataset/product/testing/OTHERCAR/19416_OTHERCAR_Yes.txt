            The best part about this mini-Sports Utility Vehicle is that the standard package has the basics everyone seems to want.  Air conditioning, power locks and windows, automatic transmission and electric dual sport mirrors.  It also doesn't have a mini-Sports Utility Vehicle feel; you can tell it was built from the inside out.  I always feel I am in control of this SUV.  Everything is pretty easy to get to.  Most CR-Vs I've seen are the 4-wheel-drive variety.  Maybe that's because the CR-V appeals to folks that wanted something more expensive.  I've read other reviews of people that were pleasantly surprised by the CR-V, even though it was their &quot;second choice.&quot;  I have a 2-wheel-drive and think it's great. There's plenty of storage, in the front doors, under the front passenger seat, behind both front seats and the back.  Not only is there ample room to store in the back, but there's a large well, open side compartments on either side and a compartment in the rear door.  There's also a hook on the rear door to hang a trash bag for camping and tailgating.  The table is a great bonus.  I've had people over 6 feet tall sit in the front passenger and the rear seats &amp; they have plenty of room.  The only problem is that only the front passenger seat doesn't have an armrest.  The CR-V drives like a car.<br><br>
