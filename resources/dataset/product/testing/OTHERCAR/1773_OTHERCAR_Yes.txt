            I bought this car when my first car died. This was a huge improvement from what I was driving. I liked the fact that it is a convertible and the engine is very peppy. I have the V6. Handling is not the greatest, it is more of a luxury car. 

When I bought the car it had 80,000 miles on it and is still running strong at almost 100,000. This car has never left me stranded unlike my old one. The only thing that didn't work when I bought it was the remote control feature for the locks and trunk. I would definitely buy another one. When I drive this car I feel awesome. You do get allot of attention. People will talk to you at stoplights or wherever you are stopped. From what I had read this car had allot of bugs to work out in the first 40,000 miles. So if you do buy this used it's more than likely the first owner worked them all out. 

The car is fairly difficult to work on for the "do it yourself" type. I was able to change the timing belt myself which needed to be done as a precautionary measure. The engine compartment is very tight. You cannot changed the spark plugs on your own, unless you are mechanically inclined, because there are things in the way.  

Just remember that people in the backseat of a  convertible get a severe "windbeating". On the other hand the front seat is like a gentle breeze even at expressway speeds. The women never complain about their hair getting messed up or greasy. I can tell there was allot of thought put into the design of this vehicle but being the second year made was not completely tweeked.
