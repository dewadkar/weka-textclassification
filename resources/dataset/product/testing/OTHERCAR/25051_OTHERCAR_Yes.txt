            We bought our DC4800 camera a few months ago as our first digital camera. We also purchased a 128mb card so that we don't have to worry about running out of "film". I updated the firmware from Kodak's website as soon as I opened the camera (easy process took less than 5 minutes).  I have yet to take a photo that had any of the indoor problems that you see some people complain about (I think maybe they don't set the white balance).  The white balance is easy to use and takes only a few seconds to change from all sorts of different lighting conditions.   

We took the camera to Orlando on vacation, and let me just say that I am extremely happy with the quality of the photos we took. For most of the photos we used the standard 3.3 mega pixel setting, which allows us to get over 100 photos on the 128mb card, and remember that is 100 photos that you want to keep! We also took a couple of uncompressed 3.3mp pictures, mainly for things that I knew I would want to play with later. These were STUNNING!!

We also used the camera during a basketball tournament, so we had to set the shutter speed to a fast setting. The results were clear, crisp pictures of action without ANY blurring. We had several pictures of the ball in the air and people jumping, and it looks like everything was standing still. 

We also used the Sepia option to create a fun "Olde Time" photo of my friends---looks like an old fashioned photo. Great camera, glad I bought it when it had the $100 rebate (not to mention the free lens adapter for registering it), but knowing what I know now, I would still have bought it without all of that. I will be adding on the panoramic lens next to further enjoy this wonderful camera.
