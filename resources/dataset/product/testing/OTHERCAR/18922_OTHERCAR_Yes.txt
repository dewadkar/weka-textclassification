            Well, ive owned my 1993 tracker since 1998.  It was purchased used with 58,000 miles on it.  I have taken it into the repair shop ONCE to get the clutch replaced at 90,000 miles.  The vehicle has crossed the 120,000 mile mark and still runs great.  I live in Colorado and the winters can get a bit deep here.  I have had NO problems with my vehicle during the winters (as long as its in 4 wheel drive, 2 wheel drive is really bad in ice and snow). 
I get good gas mileage city usually around 25-28mpg highway easily 30+.  
It is small, duh you can see that from just looking at it. Even the 4 door models lack leg room.  I love the fact that you can sit up higher in this vehicle than you can in a car.  
I was rearended in my vehicle. I was stopped fully. The person behind me slammed on his breaks hit me, then the person behind him hit him going 50+ mph.  So my vehicle was hit twice.  My car was untouched. They did replace the bumper because it was dented as well as the cover.  The tire mount on the back was bent slightly and had to be replaced.  The frame of the car was not damaged.  
I was amazed at how well this car held up to those people hitting me. The other cars where totaled. 
I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a small suv.
