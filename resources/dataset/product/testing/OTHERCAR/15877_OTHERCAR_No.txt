            After my wife totaled her old Toyota celica a few years ago. We needed a new car.  We look at all the mid-size cars like the Honda Accord, Ford Contour and the Mazda 626.
We settled on one of the New Cloud cars for Chrysler, the Cirrus.  It was billed as a 25,000 dollar car at a 20,000 dollars price.  Mainly, because it came loaded with everything standard
except maybe a sunroof. (ABS, Airbags, Power windows, seats, mirrors and door locks, Leather, 8 speaker sound system)

The car handled great for a V-6 and got about 25-30 miles per gallon on average.

The the recalled started coming in.  The molding on the windows had to be replaced, the seat belts had to be replaced, the stereo had to be replaced, part of the braking system. Sure, I feel
safer, but each time you brought it into the dealing, they would find another problem. (or at least make you think you had a problem).  The the doors started squeaking ever time you open and closed the door.

The year after we bought the car the price dropped to under 18,000. (we got screwed)

Enough was enough.  I counted 15 times to the dealer in the first 2 years.

That was the 1995 model, I hope Chrysler has got the heads out of the clouds and built a better car.<br><br>
