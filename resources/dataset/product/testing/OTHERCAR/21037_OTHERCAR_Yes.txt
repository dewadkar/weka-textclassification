            Ok, so you want the low down on a 1994 Geo Tracker, well then you have come to the right place.  I will be giving you my unbiased opinion.

Here is some info about me for you to better understand me.  I am male, 6' 4, and I live in Minnesota, no this is not a personal ad, I just want you to see that this vehicle is large enough for tall people and is awesome in snow, especially fun for whipping donuts on icy park lots.

I bought my Tracker from my parents, it was my first vehicle, I bought it when I was 17.  It was an awesome little vehicle, it really has some balls under the hood, I was able to race (and beat) all of my friends in the new cars.  It was simple to park, it could fit anywhere.

I also used it quite a few time on road trips, it worked good, as long as you only had one passenger, it gets very uncomfortable with people sitting in the back.  Also the tracker didn't run very well over 80 mph, but since the speed limit was 70 i kept it at about 77, it shakes a little, but still gets the job done.

When winter it was really time to play with my mini 4x4.  Because of its light weight it doesn't do the best on ice, but also makes it more fun to play on the ice.  It is so small that you can play in almost any parking lot, and not have to worry about hitting any light post and stuff like that.  Because of the trackers high ground clearance and big tires, makes it plow through the snow with very little effort.

Well I guess thats about all there is to say about it.

Peace
