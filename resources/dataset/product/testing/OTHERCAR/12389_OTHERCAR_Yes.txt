            If you have never driven a Wrangler,  go out right now and test drive one.  This vehicle is one of the most fun vehicles to drive on the market today as far as SUVs go.  Make sure to get one that you can take the top down in, but also I recommend the hard top for any cold weather situations. I suggest getting the six cylinder.  It has just enough extra power for pulling and a little more zip for the freeways.  Although the gas mileage is nothing to brag about.  It only get around 17 MPG.  Other nice options are the 3 speed automatic, and the special features included in the Sahara package. 

The first thing you will notice after you climb in(literally-it is quite a bit higher off the ground than most SUVs), is the basic arrangement of the dashboard.  A bit primitive but on the other hand very classic.  You have great vision in this vehicle.  As you drive along you will notice the body roll as you corner.  It takes a little while to get used to.  You also need to remember that the most common accident with these vehicles are roll-overs.  

You will see the fun in driving this vehicle right away,  take the top down and whether you are a guy or a girl,  you will be turning heads.  People are in love with Jeeps.  They bring back that classic period and the love for the beach in just about anyone.  You will also love yourself in the Jeep.  it gives you a high outlook on life and a little more fun.

It sounds like the vehicle may be perfect, for many situations it is.  But if you go store don't plan on buying much,  there is no room to put anything.  If you plan on traveling hope that you don't have more than 3 going, there is no room for luggage.  If you like a quiet ride this one is going to make a lot of road noise. 

As for going off-road, this vehicle is the best made.  It has great climbing ability and great handling.  it can go through anything and has great ground clearance.  I read about the specs. on this vehicle and you can lift on front wheel 21 inches before the other on will come off the ground. Amazing!!

In general,  if you have little kids, not the best vehicle. If you are old and have back problems, also not the best vehicle.  But if you fit into the rest of the categories this is the sexiest, most versatile, fun vehicle on the road.

If you don't plan on buying one, at least go out and test drive one. <br><br>
