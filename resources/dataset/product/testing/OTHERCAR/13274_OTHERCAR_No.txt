            Besides the near-gripless "low rolling resistance" Michelin MXV4+ tires and a CD player that started skipping right after the warranty ran out, my transmission failed at 45,000 miles due to an internally caused failure after better than recommended maintenance.  Worse yet is Honda's substandard 36 month/36k mile powertrain warranty - buy a Nissan/Toyota/Infiniti/Lexus/VW (at least 60 mo/60k mi warranty).  Honda (and my dealer) have not yet provided assistance and don't seem interested in standing behind their clearly faulty product.  The bottom line is that no car manufacturer should even be capable of producing a transmission that fails before 50,000 miles.  My car is not the only one plagued with transmission problems - check the consumer complaint list for this car (and other 1998-2002 Accords) at the NHTSA web site if you don't believe me.  This was my first Honda, and I promise it is my LAST.
