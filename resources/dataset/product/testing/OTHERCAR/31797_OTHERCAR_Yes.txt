            I will start out boldly by stating it again, this car is the absolute king of compacts.  There isn't a competitor out there that can even compare in complete package.

I test drove one of these as soon as the '00s came out.  I was pretty impressed with about everything on this car.

Styling - With exception to the oddly shaped Focus, this car is a one of the sportiest compacts out there.  The difference is that this car also has a little class.  This car is not some geometry homework for a designer; it actually has a little more thought to it.

Power - This car's 127 HP @ 6600 RPM was more than enough to move it's light weight (almost 2600 lbs).  The power was quick and felt as if it could really get up and go.  Another positive thing is that cruising is solid and comfortable.  You don't expect any surprises from the car when they happen on the road.

Comfort - The EX's bucket seats were really pretty comfortable.  I felt safe driving this car.  It's a really solid car.  Plus the controls were all easy to reach.  Even the stereo sounded decent.

Size - Now, this is the only reason we didn't buy this car.  It's just too small for us.  This car was absolutely fine for it's class but there was no way the wife, the dane, and I were going to fit in this car.<br><br>
