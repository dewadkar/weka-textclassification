            Help!  This is more of a plea for help in diagnosing a problem that our '96 van seems to be having...rather than a real &quot;epinion.&quot; But just for the &quot;officialness&quot; of it all, I will end this plea for HELP with my review of this van...other than the problem that I am experiencing right now!!
Our van has A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E.  Sometimes it starts NO PROBLEM.  Other times it doesn't want to start at all for the first dozen or so times and then finally it starts and then won't give us any trouble the rest of the day. Then some days it just doesn't want to ever start just right just gives us the ol' &quot;CLICK&quot; and then nothing each and every time we want to go or leave anywhere! AAHHHH!
We have had it into the repair shop and OF COURSE it never failed once for them in the 30 times that they started and stopped it and started it again.  OF COURSE! But we get it back home and the same old stuff starts again.  
My husband has taken it apart and put it back together several times now, and that usually buys us a week of no trouble before it starts again.  We have switched keys (his seemed to work fine with the van while when I used my key it gave us problems...my key is used daily and his was hardly used, he hardly drove the van) and thought maybe there laid our problem because that too seemed to buy us another week of no problem.  THEN it started up AGAIN.  Ok, so maybe THAT wasn't it...
He took it apart yet again, figuring that it must be a flat spot on the starter.  Took it (the starter) into the auto store and they tested it. Perfectly fine.  Nothing wrong with the starter...We are STUMPED!!
It's not the battery, the starter/solenoid...any other ideas??
Up until now I have been perfectly happy with my van!  It only has 64,000 miles on it.  It is driven mostly in the suburbs and is a complete joy to have because of all the room for the family.  With three children and Target and grocery store runs, a family needs room. This vehicle completely fits the bill.  But, unfortunately, we can't get to those places on some days and then if we do, we may not leave the parking lot under our own power.
It has been a good vehicle, but my epinion may change unless we figure out what the heck is wrong with it!!
If anyone has any other ideas, please email me at: caprcorn28@hotmail.com
