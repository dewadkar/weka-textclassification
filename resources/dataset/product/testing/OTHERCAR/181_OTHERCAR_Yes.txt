            We bought our Tracker in May 1998--just one month before we found out I was pregnant with our son.  We absolutely loved the Tracker.  It was nice to take the top off on those hot summer days and to have the 4 wheel drive during the snowy ones.  The only problem we ran into was not having enough room for big grocery trips or for all the things we got for our showers.  It was very hard to get our son in and out of.  Finally, we traded our Tracker in for a minivan.  The Tracker was very easy to drive.  In fact, I learned how to drive a stick shift with it!  I recommend this vehicle for teenagers or those without children.<br><br>
