            In October 1998, I purchased a 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier brand new.  I've had it about two years, and for the most part find it to be pretty reliable, and the fuel economy is very good.  However, if you own one of these cars, and <i>especially if you are going to buy one used</i>, there are a couple of things you need to know that could prevent some problems down the road.

I had had my car for about a month when I got the first recall notice.  It stated that <i>certain</i> 98 Chevrolet Cavaliers with the 2.2 liter engine may have a problem where the upper radiator hose contacts the battery tray, and could eventually cause a coolant leak if left unrepaired.  I immediately took my car took the service department of the dealership I purchased it at, with the recall letter.  They checked it out, and determined that it did indeed have the problem stated in the letter.  A clip was installed on the radiator hose, and the problem was fixed (for free, of course).

Earlier this year, I received another letter.  This one was not a recall campaign, but a technical service bulletin.  The letter stated that <i>some</i> 98 Chevrolet Cavaliers equipped with the 2.2 liter engine may experience rough idle and hesitation, which could be caused by loose and improperly seated spark plug wire terminals.  The letter stated that if your car experienced any of the symptoms listed, to take it to your dealership service department, and if the problem was found to be the spark plug wire terminals, it would be fixed for free.  However, if the problem was being caused by a source other than than the spark plug wire terminals, you would be billed for all repairs (unless they were covered under your warranty).

I would have to say that the 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier has been a good car for me.  If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have bought one that had more options (mine is the base), but overall I have been satisfied.

-----------11/28/00 UPDATE-----------

Currently, the car has developed a chronic rough idle and stalling problem (which has been determined to be completely unrelated to the spark plug wire problem mentioned above), and despite being taken to the repair shop on three different occasions, no mechanic can pinpoint the problem.  Also, you hear a loud <i>thunk</i> from the rear of the car every time you release the brakes, and if there is so much as a drop of moisture in the air, every time you try to apply the brakes they will grab so hard it makes the car jerk in a way that is like an inexperienced driver who is learning a stick shift for the first time.  I sorely regret my decision to purchase this beast, and I am now looking into selling it, and hopefully purchasing a HONDA.
