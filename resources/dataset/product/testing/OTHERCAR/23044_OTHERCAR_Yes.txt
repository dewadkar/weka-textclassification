            Great camera. I've had it for ages and its been really faithful! The screen got messed up really fast but I can live with that! Easy point-and-click action, pretty ok quality. I've been getting a BIT tired of it recently as I want higher quality images and this has only 0.3 megapixels, not much at all- makes many images look more like paintings than actual photographs. But i've taken well over 1000 photos with this thing and it hasnt' let me down yet! it needs a lot of light to function properly- exposure problems- but in great amount of light it works like an angel. It does drink off battery life unfortunately- the flash takes up a lot of juice to charge up. the disks that it uses are so small and really dead cheap, available in many good electronic stores, so that's nice. An 8 MB cartridge will hold 45 high quality pictures, resolution of 640X480 which isn't too bad, but with the monitor resolutions of this age it is getting a little out of date.<br><br>
