            Everyone has a Camry. Once I rented one for a month from Hertz, I began to understand why. If you want a car of the Camry's quality with similar features, it will cost you $10K more for any other brand (exception: I believe the Honda Accord comes close).

The low-end Camry drives solidly and is very roomy. It is an excellent family car (I gather -- I don't have a family, but it is certainly roomy and safe). 

I test drove a Camry because I was considering buying one recently, and the high-end Camry (XLE V6) has an array of comfort features and drives very fast. The engine is very quiet and the wind noise is minimal (though more than some other cars I've driven).

It drives well -- not too sporty/stiff suspension, but comfortable and practical. The controls are easy to reach and use.

The only complaint I have is that there is nothing distinctive about the car, but I guess it's hard to do when you have the best selling car -- anything you do becomes standard, not distinctive.
