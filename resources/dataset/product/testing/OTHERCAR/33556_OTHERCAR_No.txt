            This was my dream car forever before I bought it.  I've owned several luxury vehicles and normally own at least two vehicles at one time, sometimes three.  Just now getting rid of my five year old SL500 which only was driven about 30,000 miles.  After 30K miles, the car feels like it has 90,000 miles on it.  I have seldom seen a car deteriorate more quickly than this SL500 despite getting the car serviced religiously.  At a sticker of over $100K (not what I paid for it fortunately), you expect more.  Here's a sample of the issues I've had with this car:

- cracked manifold
- plastic window in convertible top separated from the top
- wheel opening molding separated from vehicle
- center console cover came apart
- wheels badly misaligned three times impacting the ride quality
- display indicator lights failed
- check engine light malfunctioned twice
- battery exploded
- convertible function malfunctioned numerous times
- Pirelli tires badly worn after 15K miles

To boot, service was lackluster in one city and downright awful in another city I lived in during this time.  Even after complaining to the dealer, the response was very ambivalent as they simply had more customer issues than they could deal with making it difficult to get real attention or priority to your issues.  I even wrote a letter and email to the top brass and top service execs at Mercedes USA which went completely unacknowledged with no response.

It's a great looking car and performs well right out of the showroom, but wears out quickly and has far too many issues for a car at this price level.  Needless to say, Mercedes lost a customer here as I will probably never buy another Mercedes product ever again.

Good Luck,
