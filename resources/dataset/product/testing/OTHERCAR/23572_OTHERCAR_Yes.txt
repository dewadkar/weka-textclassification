                I bought a 1998 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 (aka Z-71).  I was very pleased with the truck when I first purchased it.  It drove like a big Lincoln Towncar, Leather, Loaded to the max.  If you are not much worried about gas mileage, this is the truck for you.  

    I kept the truck until a few months ago.  I traded it in for for a 2000 Chevrolet S-10 extracab.  Although I'll admit I do miss my Z-71, mainly because it was awesome, but I surely do not miss having to get gas every 2 or 3 days at 26 dollars a pop.  The truck had the 350 V-8 Vortex engine, which is a very powerfull engine, but a guzzler.  

    When driving over 65 miles an hour,  the third door would start whistling which drove me crazy on long trips.  The back seat had no room at all.  All of my friends are tall so when we went somewhere, I had to let them drive and sit in the front because I'm the shortest.   

    I believe this is a good buy for someone who does not plan on riding too many people with them and or someone who can afford the gas.    <br><br>
