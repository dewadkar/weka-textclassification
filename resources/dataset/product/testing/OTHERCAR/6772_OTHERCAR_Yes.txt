            This is a great car. The transmission is highly intelligent. Drive gently and the car will respond gently and get really good gas mileage. But if you need to get out of trouble then it will respond with remarkable agility! Even better, on a long journey at 65-70mph the transmission locks i.e. the torque converter stops slipping and you have the same qualities as a manual, (with a small extra loss owing to friction in the converter).

This is a vehicle for those who resent spending $20k on something that will depreciate at an alarming rate. It is very basic but that means there are fewer gizmo's to go wrong. It is large enough to be used as a taxicab (there are several such in San Francisco) but small enough to park easily (absolutely vital in San Francisco!)

Overall, extremely comfortable, well liked by passengers and drivers alike. Only minor quibbles, don't leave the car overnight with the gas tank near empty... It will take an age to start if at all.  Get used to the fact that the transmission does not disengage fully at very slow speeds so it always shudders when coming to a full stop.<br><br>
