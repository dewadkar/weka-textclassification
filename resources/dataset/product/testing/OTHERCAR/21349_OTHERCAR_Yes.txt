            I own a '99 Toyota Camry LE. I am extremely happy about the purchase. I made the decision to buy this car based on the excellent reviews that this car has been getting the past several years. I had visited the Toyota manufacturing plant in KY a long time ago and had decided then that Toyota was the car for me. I think this is a great family car with little maintenence. This is one of the most reliable car in the market today that will go on for a long time. Its very comfortable and great ease in handling this car. There is also a very high resale value if you decide to sell it at some point in time. I would strongly recommend this car over any others in this category.<br><br>
