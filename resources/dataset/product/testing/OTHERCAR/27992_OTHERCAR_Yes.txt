This car is almost perfect.  When I test drove it before leasing it I thought it WAS perfect.  But, after almost 6000 miles, I am realizing that I wish it had more power.  It's not that the 2.8l V6 itself is bad.  It's just that the car is so heavy (about 2 tons with me inside) that it has trouble on the low end.

Now that the bad part is out of the way I can tell you that I am not disappointed with anything else.  This car is a solid, well-built, well-finished piece of machinery.  There are plenty of luxury amenities as well.  For a comprehensive options list see www.audiusa.com or www.carpoint.msn.com.  Even the Bose sound system sounds great.  I am glad that I got all the options except for the warm weather package (since I live in PA) and enhanced security package  (99% of the time there is no one in the back seat so rear side airbags were not necessary).

The handling of this car is great in all weather thanks to the Quattro all-wheel drive system.  You can go full speed in rain and never feel like you are going to lose control.  I have not yet tried snow driving but I am sure it will not disappoint.

In summary, this is a fine automobile that could only benefit by having more power.  Fortunately, Audi is rectifying this by offering two more powerful engine options for the 2000 model year.  Run, don't walk, to the dealer when these become available because then I think these cars will be perfect.
