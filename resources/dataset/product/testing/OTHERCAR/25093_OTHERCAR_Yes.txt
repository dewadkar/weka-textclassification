            I'm a proud owner of the best mid-size SUV on the road today.It is only 10 horse power less than a Tahoe. More horse power than the base model Ford Expidition and it doesn't blow-out tires. It's a great looking SUV, not a over sized beast. Great on the gas and insurance. Leather seats,with eight way power seats, CD player, power sun-roof, fog-lights,digital dual climate control,side air bags, 270 horse power from a in-line six cylinder engine. Towing package comes in handy. I thought I would never buy a black colored SUV but, this one looks great. Crome billet grill, tinted glass, and more extra's. (DVD, sound system, ON-STAR!)Molded real wood grain, Off-roading is a dream. The SUV drives like it was born to drive off-road. Road trips have been great, lots of room! But remeber stay out of the mud. I recommend this SUV to any person wanting the best from an SUV and great price. Look out Ford! Also XM radio is a must. Before buying read www.gm.com!!!!!!!
