            WOW!! What a car! What an engine! What an experience!

Thats exactly what this car is, an experience. What kind of experience you ask? Thats the best part, you get to decide.

With its ultra high revving (9000 rpms redline!!) and high output enigne, along with a solid chassis and fine tuned suspension, this car is just plain fast! Straight line or hairpins, this car can take it and take it fast! With a 13.8 quarter mile time, this car will hang with nearly any car on the street, including those exotics from italy and germany. With its solid chassis(trust me, you will be surprised, i had no idea a convertible could be this solid!) and excellent suspension, it will carry that speed through hair-pins, switch-backs, or any other corner you can throw at it.

ANd the sound!!!! Hearing that i-4 scream at 9000 rpms as you powershift into the next gear, only to have it rev instantly back up to 9000 rpms is just orgasmic! At idle, the engine is nearly nonexistent, just a deep, quiet rumble. Until you dump the clutch at 7500 rpms and let this car do what it was intended for!! 0-60 in low 5's with the back end screaming, wow!! Honda has finally done it, and at only $32,000! Nearly 1/2 the price of the competition, and thoroughly spanking them in the performance arena!

The shifter is like a dream! This thing is like driving a video game! The throw betweem gears is literally little more than an inch or so! And the throw is silky smooth! Other than Porsche, i have never felt a shifter so amazingly smooth! But not even the Porsche 996 can match its amazingly short throw bewteen gears. The steering wheel is also small, allowing for easy side-to-side manuvers, further adding to the video game feel.

The interior, pure sports car! Racing Seats, titanium shift knob, small grippy steering wheel, large center to house that magical tranny. Theres even a cover to hide the radio away to add even more to that race car feel.

At the same time, you could also take it easy on engine,and still get excellent gas mileage (it is a i-4 honda, remember?). Keep the rpms below 5700 where the vtec kicks in, and gas mileage goes way up....but its oh so easy to floor it, and what a temptation :)

An amazing car, truly amazing. If you can get your hands on one, sign the contract!<br><br>
