              I bought a 1995 Gramd Am SE last November (1999) and only had to get a new battery. It has 65k miles. So far it is 100 times better then my previous car, a 1986 Chevy Chevette ( a real P.O.S.!).  It is a 4 banger with 16 valves DOHC that makes some pretty nice sound when you accelerate hard (if you like a noisy engine that sound powerful, this car is for you.)  
  I have a few mods done to i including white dual wiper blades, a JVC CD player, tinted windows and fuzzy dice.  I havent had any problems in the 5 months i have owned this beast and i hope never to have as many problems with it as i did with the Chevette ( $700 dollars worth of repairs in 2 months!!!).
  This car looks wicked aggressive even for a 4-door sedan and has better handling than my friend's Mustang GT ( he even said so).  It whips around corners fast and can take an off ramp on the highway at a continous 55 MPH with ease.  
I love it's design both interior and exterior and the comfort is decent, the room however is tight in the back but fine in the front, my freind who is 6'5&quot; 232 lbs can fit up front comfortably but there is now way he could sit in back. 
  The acceleration is very snappy, i have smoked alot of cars off the line at red lights with my GA and can reach 110 MPH in about 20-25 seconds, one downfall of my car is that the speed is electronicly limited to about 115 MPH, but im working to remove the limiter.  All in all this is a Phat Car and i give it 2 thumbs up.  All I can say is get one!<br><br>
