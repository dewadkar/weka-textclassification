            my mother was given a chevy conversion van maybe 2 years ago for free. it is a '94 model and has 6 doors in all. It is a very nice and roomy van. There are four seats and in the far back one bench seat. Our biggest problem with the chevy van is that it only starts 50% of the time! A few weeks ago my family and i were on our way up to michigan when we stopped to fill up the gas tank (it's a gas guzzler!). My mother turned the car off, filled her tank, and then tried to start it but no luck there! we let the car sit for 15 minutes then tried again, no response! We then proceded to ask around the station if anyone could help and one man said he might. This guy said he owned a  chevy van much like ours and he had the same problems. luckily after a total of 25 minutes or so it started! I have driven the van around and i didn't like how the driver's seat is like a deep bucket, it's hard especially since i'm rather short. The electrical system kind of when burzerk and now the T.V. and the VCR don't work. During our trip the back bench seat somehow got &quot;stuck&quot; in the reclined position. Nothing was blocking it but it just wouldn't come back up to the normal position. I would say families who will only be traveling places should use this van. People who need every day transportation should not. <br><br>
