            It's true, after buying this car, I probaly won't ever leave BMW. There is just something about getting in my BMW that is different from the other cars I have owned.

Before my 328is (the coupe) I owned a Nissan Pathfinder, a Mazda 626, and a Honda Accord, all of the year 1993. (Don't ask, just chance.) They were all decent cars, reliable and good looking. I bought the Pathfinder cuz I wanted a truck like vehicle, but soon tired of it's SUV handling. The Mazda was a great car, but the transmission melted. Other than that it was really reliable. And then the Accord was stolen.

These cars were all very nice, but they didn't have something that the BMW did (does). A sense that you are really "driving." I know that sounds odd, but driving a BMW is the closest most of us will ever get to sitting in a race car. It's not the fastest vehicle around mind you, but it is still darn fast, and can smoke most cars around. You buy a BMW if you still like to drive. Sometimes I just go take it for a spin. I love the way it handles, the way it feels the road and hugs the curves; the way you can push it right to the limit of losing control, even with a little tail waggle. (I don't recommend doing this.) And then there is the speed, ahhh the speed. If you ever drive this car, be careful, speeding tickets are right around the corner. I have been on the freeway before going 65, looked away for a second, and then looked down to see I'm going 90. It's that easy and that quick. I beg of you if you get this car, get the manual transmission. That is half the driving. Nothing like dropping it a gear to quickly gain speed on a freeway to pass.

The exterior is just beautiful. Very nice lines; often I just go and stare at it. It's fierce and strong, and quite bold. The interior is a bit lacking (stark), but it is by no means "cheap." The leather is actually leather, and it is worth taking care of it, as it only gets more comfy. I would call the seating "semi-racing" seating as it provides kidney support to keep you from sliding. Overall the interior is tight[ish], but unless you are 6' 4" you won't have a problem. The tightness of the interior matches the tightness of the control giving a sense of total driver control.

I have had no mechanical problems, excluding a right side window that won't roll down. But that is because people keep using the window to close the door instead of the door handle. Savages.

The Harmon/Kardon 10 speaker sound system sounds rather nice to me, and I have had aftermarket sound systems. It isn't *that* nice, but for a "Stock" system it is quite nice.

The only complaint I would have about it is...well I don't have any complaints actually. Go test drive one today.
