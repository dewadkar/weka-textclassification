            More than just used--thoroughly hammered.  Five years ago, I found myself in a bad way--my '73 Mustang went belly up, requiring over $3,000 in repairs.  Not being someone who can merrily toss $3,000 to a shop, I found myself in the market for a very CHEAP vehicle.  So I perused the used car classifieds, hoping to find something that would move for less than $1,000.  I found it--the ugliest, most battle worn rust bucket you've ever seen.  What was it?  A 1978 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, rocker panels turning to orange dust, tail pipe held on with a coat hanger.  Asking price?  Eight-hundred dollars.  I snapped it up, hoping the thing would just hang on for a few months.  

Fast forward to the present.  It's still hanging on in a grand fashion.  This Jeep has taken me from Utah to California, from Montana to Nevada, with no complaints.  It's gotten me along the Nez Perce trail, and taken me through Death Valley.  I love my Jeep.   It holds kids, dogs, camping gear, and a whole lot more.  The rear windshield rolls down, and the tail gate folds down for easy access to the back.  This truck is comfortable and comforting.  The seats are full bench style, with a fold down arm rest that makes it nice and comfy.  Does it show its age?  Sure it does, but for $800.00, I got a sweet deal, and a few oil changes and tune ups a year are enough to keep it happy. This vehicle has consistently met or exceeded local emissions standards, and its engine (the original--over 200,000 miles, no rebuilds) is still running strong and clean.  While this is not the vehicle for those in search of terrific gas mileage, if you're in the market for a good, used SUV, look for a Jeep--they may not be indestructible, but they're the closest thing to it I've found.<br><br>
