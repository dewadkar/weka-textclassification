                 My 1998 Oldsmobile Cutlass is a 4 door sedan. It retailed for $19,425 and offers a nice package. Remote keyless entry, Power windows, door locks and mirrors, air conditioning vents in windshield pillars and rear seating vents. Headlamps and daytime running lights, split folding rear seat, Seats 5, Has a 15 gallon gas tank and gets about 30 miles to the gallon. 

     The look and style of the Cutlass makes it a very stylish, affordable family car. I am used to drive the Chevrolet Cavalier and although that was a great car for me, my needs have changed  since starting a family. This car has reclining, bucket seats in the front with bench seating in the back. The bucket seats fit me so well and allow me the room I need to drive comfortably. 

     I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to upgrade to a bigger and better car.
