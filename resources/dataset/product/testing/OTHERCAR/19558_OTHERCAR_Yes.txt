            I was in the market for a new vehicle, and being 6'6&quot;, and 300+ pounds, I don't have the luxury of being able to pick and choose any car or truck off a lot that I like.  The good news is that I actually love the larger vehicles, not only because of my size, but because I like to be higher up, and feel that my family and I are well protected in case of an accident.

When I started looking, I was really hoping to get the Ford Excursion.  I had investigated it quite a bit, and even applied for Ford credit online.  However, when it came down to driving it, I ended up having a stark realization hit me.  The Excursion only gets about 7 miles to the gallon. I go 10 miles each way to work, so in a given week, I'd be using over 14 gallons of fuel just to go back and forth to work.  Add the night and weekend driving on to that and you end up with a nightmarish amount of gas used each month.  With the gas prices the way they are right now, I couldn't justify the Excursion, even though it was by far the most spacious of the large vehicles I drove.  In addition, the ride was incredibly truck-like, with most every bump being felt inside.  One huge plus was the absolute silence, the thing was just incredibly quiet, even on the highway with the stereo off.

I next checked out the Expedition, which, before the Excursion came along, I was thinking would be my next vehicle.  While it still was very roomy, the positioning of the door console makes it difficult for the drivers left leg to be all that comfortable in anything but a straight position.  If raised to where your foot is flat, the console prevents your leg from leaning outward, forcing it into an upright position which is pretty uncomfortable.  However, that is probably the worst thing I could say about the Expedition.  Sure, the third seat is not all that useful for anything other than small kids, and the gas mileage is not that great still (although at 12 mpg, its much better than the Excursion), but I still liked it very much.

The issue I had with it when it came to buying it was the price.  Now, I might have been able to get a better price if I had gone to multiple Ford dealers, but I'm sure not much better.  Plus, the sales staff just gave me a bad impression with bait and switch type tactics and coming back with a higher price than originally quoted the day before I was going to pick up the truck.

A friend of mine who swears by Chevy's (like I used to swear by Ford's) suggested I go see the Chevy dealer he used for leasing his previous three vehicles (two Suburbans and a Silverado).  I did, and they beat the price on the Expedition lease by almost $100 a month.  So I bought it, knowing how they drove (very car-like) and how much more room there is than the Expedition, including a third seat usable by two &quot;normal&quot; adults, and three kids or &quot;slim&quot; adults.

However, as time has gone on, I realize that while I am saving $100 per month, I can't wait to get rid of this vehicle.  Despite the additional room and smoother ride, the room that I have as the driver is lacking.  I had far more headroom in both the Expedition and the Excursion.  I could care less about any of the other niceties in the Suburban, I just want to be comfortable and have a decent ride.  The worst part about it is that with the 2000 model, they have actually downsized the Suburban a little bit, due to it's sharing of a frame with the Silverado pickup.  My decision ended up being more about money than about comfort.

Over the course of the lease I'll end up saving $3600.  I plan to take that money and put the extra cash down on at least the Expedition (unless the Excursion has a smoother ride and better gas mileage by then).  This way, I know I have the head and leg room I need.

For anyone who doesn't have to worry so much about comfort as I do, the Suburban is an excellent vehicle, and I recommend it over the Excursion and Expedition for a big SUV.  However, if it is the comfort of a big driver that is most important, there is no doubt in my mind that either Ford is a better way to go.
