            Prior to purchasing my '98 Wrangler I shopped mainly sports cars.  I've owned several &quot;sports&quot; cars over the years and thought I would buy another.  The thought of a buying a Wrangler wasn't seriously considered, I knew that a Jeep would be fun but it really didn't fit my image.  
  About four years ago I began attending and working the Baja races with SCORE International.  Three times a year I wind up in Mexico working a check point at some off road location.  My poor old Prelude was having trouble getting to the locations, I broke my front axel and had to limp home on one trip.
  The lark of an idea of buying a Wrangler suddenly got serious.  I rented a Wrangler for the weekend and took it off road.  What a blast.  I loved the power of the straight six, the feel of the wind in my face with the top down, and the feeling of power and control coming from sitting so high.
  After the rental it took me three months to track down the exact vehicle I wanted.  I got on the Jeep-L mailing list and got advice from the good people there as to which options I should purchase.
  With the Jeep-L help I would up with a Sahara model with the Dana 44 rear end, a five speed manual (this was against the advice of the list but I love manual trannys), both soft and hard tops, cruise control and air.  Cost came to $24000.  
  I get some complaints from passengers about wind and noise but it doesn't bother me.<br><br>
