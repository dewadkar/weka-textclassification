            Toyota Avalon is the 1st attempt by Toyota to build a big car that could compete with Detriot's big boys, such as the Buick LeSabre.  One thing is for sure, this car isn't anything like the Buick.

As Toyota's American flagship model built in America, the engineers at Toyota wanted to get things right the first time around.  They created a car that has many creature features, and one of the biggest back seats i've ever seen.  

The engine under the hood is more powerful than it looks.  It has V8 like performance, with only a 3.0L V6 engine, producing over 200 hp.  Fuel economy for such a powerful engine is excellent.  Acceleration off the line is about 8 sec. for the 0-60 and perhaps about 17 sec for the 1/4 mile.  Brakes are 4 wheel ABS, which stop this car extremely quick.

The ride is just as good as any luxury car on the market today, and the handling of this big car is excellent.  For its giant size, its able to cut in and out of stop and go traffic and zip into and out of the smallest parking lots created.

For the price, you are getting so much car.  Sure its over $30,000 for this car, but in the long run, you will save.  Over the last 24,000 miles for me, this car hasn't needed any out of ordinary service.  Seems like this car can run forever.
