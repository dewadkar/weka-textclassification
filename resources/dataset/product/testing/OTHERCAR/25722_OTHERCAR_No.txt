            I bought my '99 red Beetle in October of '98.  From the moment the car came out, I was in love with it.  Determined to have it, I went to a dealership and got myself one! 

   The dealer experience should have been a sign, but I decided to ignore the fact that my Beetle was 2 months late.  When it arrived,  I was so happy, I did not care.  I had a car that looked like a little space-ship!!   I loved driving at night, because the interior is so great! All the little lights inside, with WOW colors.  Quite different and unusual.   I was the envy of the neighborhood. 

 Of course, the safety features of the new Beetle are great also, daylight running lights, dual airbags, side airbags, anti-lock breaks.  The car handles everything perfectly.  

  Then, out of the blue, everything started breaking down.  It started with little things -- my visor light would not turn off, the little metal cap on the hand brake fell off,  my power mirrors mysteriously stopped functioning, a certain liquid was leaking out of the front of the car.  It took the dealership 2 weeks to fix my car.    I was devastated. 

 It didn't stop there, I had to take my Bug in again, this time for a battery leak, and again because the automatic transmission would not budge from park one morning -- I had to have the car towed to the dealership to be fixed.  They were mystified over the cause of the problem, just as the tow truck driver was.  

  When the tires ($200.00 a piece) started exploding, I said that's it, and got rid of it.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Volkswagen or the Beetle, it may have been this particular car.  Just, beware of models that are brand new and get good warranty coverage -- you will need it. <br><br>
