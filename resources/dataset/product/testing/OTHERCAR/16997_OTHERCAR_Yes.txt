            If you are looking for a small, luxury sport utility vehicle that seats 7, then this is the SUV for you!

The Acura MDX has a lot to offer!  It is a small, luxury sport utility that seats 7 people comfortably.  There are 4 levels of the MDX.  Premium (base model), Premium with navigation, Touring and Touring with navigation.  The hardest model to come by is the premium with navigation, as most people want the options that come with the Touring package.

The exterior lines of the MDX are very crisp streamlined so that the front end of the car is narrower than the back end (this is also supposed to help reduce the chance of rolling over).  The fender flares that are standard in the touring package add a nice touch!  

The interior of the MDX is top of the line.  There are 3 rows of seats, with the 3rd row that lays down flat.  You don't have to worry about pulling the 3rd row out and storing it, or if you happen to buy a large piece of furniture, it isn't a problem either.  There are many cupholders throughout the SUV so you are never lacking a place to set your drink.  The wood adds a nice, classy touch that sets the Acura apart from other sport utilities.  The MDX is based on the Honda Odessy mini-van chassis, so it doesn't drive like a truck.  When you hit a bump in the road, the suspension absorbs it very well.  The ride is very quiet and the acceleration is excellent!

One thing that I don't like about the MDX is the middle seat in the second row.  It is a 3-point seatbelt that comes out of the ceiling, therefore there isn't just a standard lap belt.  This makes things VERY difficult if you have a child in a carseat, as this makes the carseat lean towards the passenger side.  It also is a distraction for the driver with the belt coming out of the ceiling.  

The navigation system is wonderful!  Since I live in a large town (Dallas/Fort Worth), it really comes in handy to get around town.  You can enter a phone number and it will give you directions based on that, or you can pick from categories or just enter the address.  It is a touch screen system or you can use the mini-joystick next to the screen to make your selections.

The problem with the MDX is that there is a waiting list.  I purchased my 2001 MDX in the beginning of September.  Luckily after making a lot of calls, I found a dealership that was getting in several and I was able to get on the waiting list and have the car within 2 weeks.  All the other dealerships were giving me the run around, though they were able to "find" some when they knew I was buying elsewhere.  

This car is definitley worth a look and I don't regret having to wait.  I looked at Yukon's, Sequoia's, 4-runner's, Lexus RX's, Montero's, Explorer's and Expedition's and this was the best!  I highly recommend this car!
