               <b>O</b>ne of the best handling sport coupes ever made by Volkswagon became even better when it was fitted with a 15 degree V6 engine (also known as the VR6). The VW Corrado offers loads of excitement, and while not being the fastest car on the market, there is no doubt in anyone who has ever driven this car's mind that the Corrado is definitely unique, and offers a 'fun factor' like no other VW of this time period; period.

     <b>The '93 Corrado SLC (sport luxury Coupe)</b> is like no other VW I have ever driven. The closest VW manufactured car that it comes close to in comparison is the new Golf GTI, but even then there is something special that sets the Corrado apart from the rest of the pack. My test car was a SLC coupled with a 5-speed manual (a 4 speed automatic is optional). 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is very strong, and unlike the G60 which offers a supercharged 4-cylinder, the SLC can actually burn rubber through 2nd gear on take-off and compete with the competition such as the Turbocharged MR2, and even the Mustang GT which was powered by a much larger engine during this time period. The '93 Corrado comes with a DOHC 2.8 liter V6 that pumps out a very healthy 178 horsepower, and 177 lb-ft of torque, both which are reached at a relatively low RPM. This narrow angled V6 pulls very strongly, especially at higher engine speeds.
 
Hills are a snap for the Corrado, no need to down-shift from 5th to 4th, there is enough torque at a reasonable RPM to send this car up the steepest inclines without having to down-shift. 

<b>Cruising</b> is one of the Corrado's strongest attributes, quiet, firm, and almost noise free, the passengers, and driver are transported in a very pleasant environment. Despite having a combination of an iron-block V6 at the front and the very abbreviated back end, meaning the weight distribution was very front heavy, the 

<b>handling</b> in the '93 Corrado V6 is superb. 
The steering is incredibly precise and the driver feels very connected to what the car is doing. The '93 Corrado turns in very sharply, never understeers, and grips like no other VW. 

<b>Braking</b> is also excellent, 4-wheel disc brakes, mated with 4-wheel ABS assure quick stops even at high speeds. The V6 powered Corrado not only is a sports car, but can also can be considered quite economical, with an EPA of almost <b>28 mpg</b> on the freeway. You will find that filling your tank does not empty your wallet.

   The '93 Corrado sits on a relatively short 97.3" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 159.4". The Front <b>Suspension</b> consists of Macpherson struts with lower control arms, telescopic shocks absorbers, and an anti roll bar. The rear suspension has a torsion bean axle with trailing arms, telescopic shock absorbers, and an anti roll bar.

<i>Accommodation/interior design:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the SLC, although it was an up market coupe in the VW range, the Corrado's interior is quite basic, and  despite the SLC standing for 'sport luxury coupe' there really is not too much 'luxury' associated with this car. The drivers position is almost perfect, and so are ergonomics, but amenities are just average, and certainly do not match the amenities I would associate with  that of a luxury car. Some noteworthy amenities included a cold AC, tachometer, traction control, an AM/FM cassette player, power sunroof, auto seat belts, and power windows and locks. The seats in my test car were made of quality cloth and were very supportive, and comfy. Room is adequate up front, but the rear, like most small hatchbacks, is very cramped, and adults sitting in the back most likely will be very uncomfortable.

<i>Exterior innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> looks like no other VW on the road, and no other car on the road period for that matter. While the styling is quite controversial, I find the look to be very unique, and a fresh design to the plethora of boring looking hatchbacks on the market. A VR6 badge in the rear, and five-spoke alloys segregate the V6 models from the lesser Corrado's, especially in foreign markets. Although very unique looking, the combination of a high price for a car bearing the VW badge, and looks which were 'neat' and not 'striking' meant that the Corrado did not become the success that it most certainly deserved to be. 

 <i>Price and Reliability</i> 

Back in '93 the Corrado V6 ran around $22,000, quite high for a Volkswagon in 1993. Today the Corrado is quite a collectible, so prices will be fairly high. A '93 Model with the V6 engine will set you back around $12,000, maybe less or more depending on mileage, condition, etc. The owner of this car has 75,000 miles on his Corrado, and has had virtually no problems whatsoever. I do suggest checking out Consumer Reports, or consulting with other owners before buying this car.  

<b>Conclusion:</b> The 1993 Coraddo represents a great value in the used 'sports car' market.
