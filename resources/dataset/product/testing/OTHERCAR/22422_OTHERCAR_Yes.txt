            This is quite possibly my favorite car of all time. I have always been an admirer of cars, and sports cars especially have always attracted me the most. With its stylish, sleek, good looks, its high end performance, and its relativly low price tag, this car rivals every other car ever made. How many other cars have had a television show based and named after it. With a top speed of over 160 miles per hour and an acceleration of 0-60 in  around 5 seconds this car definatly has some power. The awesome red color and body of the car make it very appealing. If I could have one car, this would be it.<br><br>
