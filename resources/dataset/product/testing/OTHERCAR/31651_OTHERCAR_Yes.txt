            Well I feel neutral on this car.  My boyfriend bought it this past February.  It is green, with black interior.  It has a spoiler am/fm cassette and cd player, a/c, and it is an automatic.  It only had 57,000 miles on it.  It is a really cute car, I loved it at first, then I got to know it.  

It runs great(a little noisy), and it can be sluggish up hills. One day I was in a torrential down pour and could not figure out how to work the window wipers.  First you have to twist the knob then you pull it down.  Most cars only have you do one or the other to get them to work.  I am 5'4&quot; and I can barely fit in the back seat.  It is so small.  It is annoying to get back there too because you have to mess up the position of the front seat to get in the back.  

The passenger side seat belt has two belts, which makes no sense because the drivers side is normal.  The gas mileage is excellent, and becuase it is a Toyota it is reliable and has given us no problems other than the water pump.  I would not recommend this car for anyone over 5'9&quot; (my boyfriend is 5'8&quot; and just fits up front), or a family.  Good car for a high school or college student.  Wonderful on fuel, 34 miles to the gallon around town.  It is difficult to get in and out of too, it sits really low.  Overall it is a decent car if you plan on not taking any friends anywhere and you are of small stature.<br><br>
