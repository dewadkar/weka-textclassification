                   You don�t have to be part of a seven person family to be interested in this minivan!  The Honda Odyssey 2000 displays much features that will attract and satisfy all kinds of drivers.  Not to mention, voted #1 minivan by dozens of car buyers, car magazines, and anything else with an opinion.  It�s a simple issue of facts.  The Honda Odyssey is the best minivan.  Here is my opinion on why it is the best vehicle to own.

<b>Safety</b>

      Safety is a key element in buying a car for almost everyone, unless you are a speed fiend that looks for those aluminum 200 lb. cars that go 900 mph.  Then safety is a little further down. However for most people, safety is pivotal.  So you want a safe car then.  The Honda Odyssey was rate 2000�s most safest car by various top-quality sources such as Car Buyer, Car Digest, and others.  There you have it.  Tests stand true and Odyssey comes out on top.  But many people say that even though tests are performed to enact real-life situations, they are ONLY tests.  One reason why I have so much faith in the Odyssey is that I did get in an accident with it once.  I was returning from a soccer tournament one day.  I was driving over a hill, and halfway down the hill there was a stoplight.  The light changed to yellow, and I had felt I couldn�t make it past before the light changed to red, so I braked fairly quickly. To my disadvantage, there had been a Jeep behind us, and the driver was not paying attention, hitting us at almost 35 mph!  The car skidded to a halt some 100 yards from the light.  The frame of the car was ruined, back all smashed up, looked like a disaster scene.  But most important, myself, my husband, and out four kids all walked away from the accident, not one scratch!  I definitely appreciate the safety qualities of the Odyssey such as a strong frame, child-proof seat belts, dual airbags, and tons more.  

<b>Roomy</b>

    Not much to say here, besides the fact that it feels more like you are riding in a small house than in a matchbox.  It�s a big car, and it gives you your space.  3 rows of seats all with adequate leg room and body room for grownups in every seat.  The Odyssey can hold 7 adults easily, of course excluding Sumo- wrestlers.  (Then the vehicle your looking for might be an 18-wheeler truck.)  Anyway, plenty of room.  Also, you can remove the middle seats to have two very roomy rows.  The back seat also fold down under a compartment under the car.  Easily removing the middle and back seat allows easy travel with bulk materials.  Turn your Odyssey into a carrying van!

<b>Comfortable</b>

     Nice, cloth seats allows for maximum comfort. (God I sound like a tampax commercial).  The seats are fairly wide, and each has two armrests.   Adjustable leg room as well as adjustable incline of your seat.  The Odyssey equips each seat with enough to make anyone comfortable.  Not hard to find "that perfect position", lean back, and fall asleep to music playing through 6 top-quality sounding speakers on a CD player.  (WARNING: DON�T FALL ASLEEP WHILE DRIVING).    

<b>Smooth, quiet, and strong engine</b>

     Many drivers get a thrill out of hearing that engine purr like a cat.  Well, to tell you the truth its hard to hear with the ear against the hood!  Although only 4 cylinders, the engine runs very strong and smooth. I don�t know how I would get up my uphill, 2-tenths-of-a-mile driveway with any other vehicle other than a snowmobile.  Now that is a strong engine.  I can�t tell you how many times I�ve tried to start the car when it was already running! The quiet ride of the Odyssey is a definite plus for this minivan.   

<b>Accessories</b>

     Odd facts of the Odyssey include front-wheel drive, 18 mpg, aluminum V6 engine, 9 cup holders, seat pockets, CD player, 6 phenomenal speakers, dual sliding doors, 7 internal lights, floor mats, coin box, steering wheel-mounted audio controls (for those who like to pay attention while driving), and 4 speeds (automatic)
