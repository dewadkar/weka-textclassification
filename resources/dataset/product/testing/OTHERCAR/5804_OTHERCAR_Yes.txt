            This is the second digital camera I have owned, also from Olympus. The first was the D-220L that I bought as in introduction to digital photography and it didn't take long to realize its limitations. After toying with various brands and models that friends had purchased, I decided to research for myself what I would like in my next camera. I spent about a month searching the web and gathering all the reviews I could find, then I went to several retailers and drove salespeople nuts trying out just about every camera that had the same features I was looking for. I finally settled on the D-490 Zoom for the simply reason that the pictures blew me away. I was even more pleased when I realized how long the batteries lasted me before replacement and how unobtrusive it is to carry. There is nothing bad that I can say about this camera. I know the most common complaints are the lack of USB and no sound in the mpeg movies. BIG DEAL, first of all you don't need the USB port...just get a SanDisk SmartMedia USB card reader (why would you download the pictures from your camera even if it had USB, it drains the batteries and is not as fast as the card reader which acts as another drive on your computer). As for the lack of sound, again pffft! Buy a video camera, I mean how long do you think these movies are anyway? The movie capability wasn't even a factor. If you want EXCELLENT photos and a camera that is totally uncomplicated to use yet highly versatile, then the Olympus D-490 Zoom should more than fit the bill.<br><br>
