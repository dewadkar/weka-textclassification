                I personally just bought a brand new 99 accord, and for the price there is not better car.  they drive incredibly smooth and take the curves at high speeds very nicely.  I even beat an infinity in a drag race down a one mile stretch.  The best thing about these cars is that they have one of the best resale rates of any car in the nation right now.
Oh,  I almost forgot about the gas mileage, all I have to say is excellent compared to any other high powered car that I have driven.  lastly is the style,  I have never gotten so much attention by a car in my life.  the chicks dig it, and I worship it! <br><br>
