            REVISION NOTE 5/25/01:  GO AHEAD AND READ MY ORIGINAL WRITEUP IF YOU WANT FIRST--THIS REVISION IS A (almost) 50K MILE UPDATE.
--I've noticed a disturbing trend:  five broken lug nuts when rotating tires.  My local tire store cringes everytime I walk in because servicing my tire warranty with them has cost them a rental car ($60), replacement of four lug nuts and a new wheel ($560).  I watched yesterday as the guy had one simply break off when trying to remove it.  These lug nuts seem to be engineered to minimum safety standards.  
--In addition, I guess these aren't as tough as they like to advertise.  At 42,000 miles, while replacing one of the lug nuts, I had the dealer call me and inform that the wheel bearings "fell out" and had to be replaced.  That's $300 plus at my cost (past warranty, of course...).
--I did end up replacing back rotors.  All that squeaking I referred to in my 7/00 update was evidently more than just pads, eh? 
--My only other problem has been the ignition key. It sticks in the ignition fine but getting it out has become nearly impossible.  I was told that would be about $250 to replace the ignition so I just struggle with it every time I get out of the truck for now.
Overall, at almost 50K miles, it has been a pretty good purchase.  I would still recommend it for the price but I will be looking at a Blazer/Bravada on my next purchase.

Original write-up:
I just bought a 2000 Chevy Tracker.  It wasn't my first choice in the mini-SUV category but GM & the dealer made me an offer I couldn't refuse.  Now that I've driven it a few days, I am pretty happy with my decision.

Here's Why:
* I really liked the Honda CRV but since I am a GM buyer, I was able to get $2650 capital cost reduction (like a rebate on a lease) and a 3.25% lease rate.  So even though my "loaded" Tracker has the same sticker as the "loaded" CRV, the payment was $100 less on a three year lease.  Unfortunately, this program ended January 3rd, 2000.  Maybe they will run it again since they want to be more aggressive in their sales...

* Although the CRV is a little bigger in dimensions (two inches or so in backseat leg room and five or six inches in cargo area behind the seats), for my family's needs the Tracker will do just fine.  We also drive a van so this is mainly just for errands and commuting.  I previously drove a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am.  This is easier to get into (the Grand Am was really low to the ground), has a lot more head room and is wider.  The visibility is pretty good too since you sit up higher.

* My "loaded" Tracker has power windows, cruise, keyless entry, CD player, power mirrors, rear window wiper and 4-wheel drive.  All of these are little things that are luxuries but my last car had none of them.  They all seem to work pretty nice and I recommend them.  Unfortunately, these all increase the base price pretty quickly.

*  A few things I would like improved (and some are really nit-picky)
-The visors are pretty cheap.  They are so thick that my garage door opener does not fit over it.
-The back seats really need an inch or two more of leg room.
-When going uphill with the cruise on (I was on an interstate)it really labors to speed up to the requested speed and stayed on too long I felt.  This is a combination of too weak of an engine and the cruise not really being set right.
-there is a little but more wind noise in the Tracker than my Grand Am.  This really isn't a surprise since it sits straight up.  It does get a little wobbly in a 25mph+ wind though.
-The back seats do fold down but I have to move the passenger seat almost all the way forward to get the back seat to lay flat.  The side behind me cannot lay flat if I drive because I have the seat back a bit. (see above note about an extra inch or two in leg room...)

Even with the negatives, though, if you can get a good price ( I went to three dealerships to get the best deal), it is a buy in the category.  It isn't a Durango or Exterra but it gives my wife and I peace of mind with the four wheel drive in the oft-changing Indiana weather (snow & ice).

UPDATE: 3/1/2000--I'VE OWNED THIS SUV FOR TWO MONTHS NOW AND HAVE HAD ZERO PROBLEMS WITH IT.  IT SEEMS VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER.  I HAVE AVERAGED 18.5 MPG WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE WAY I DRIVE.  YOU WILL GET HIGHER WITH NORMAL DRIVING.  AS FOR WIND NOISE, I ADDED THE CROSS-MEMBERS TO THE ROOF RACK AND THE NOISE WENT WAY UP.  JUST BE AWARE...

AS FOR THINGS I WOULD LIKE CHANGED (FOR ANY ENGINEERS FROM CHEVY WHO MIGHT READ THIS): MOVE THE MIDDLE CONSOLE SO THAT THE GAS PEDAL CAN BE PLACED 2-3 INCHES TO THE RIGHT. IT CAN BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A GUY AFTER AWHILE.  GOOD LUCK IF YOU BUY IT...
note: price listed below is sticker

UPDATE: 7/4/2000--SIX FULL MONTHS OF OWNING IT, 16000 MILES. I HAVE AVERAGED 19.4 MPG ON START & STOP DELIVERY TYPE DRIVING FOR 75% OF MILES.  CHANGED OIL EVERY 3K AND ROTATED TIRES EVERY OTHER OIL CHANGE.  ONLY PROBLEM SO FAR IS BRAKES HAD TO BE WORKED ON.  NEW PADS FOR FRONT AXLE (DISC).  BACK ARE SQUEAKING LIKE CRAZY.  THEY SAID THEY CLEANED THEM BUT IT CAME BACK WITHIN A WEEK.  NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT.  NO OTHER PROBLEMS.  STILL VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.
