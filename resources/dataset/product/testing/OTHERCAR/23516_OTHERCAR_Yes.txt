            This is a great car.  The power, handling and performance are impressive, as are the looks.  The low ground clearance got me stuck a couple times in a snowstorm, but that is to be expected on a performance car, Quattro or not I suppose.

My gripes are not with the car in ideal conditions.

Don't hurt it.  My s4 has been in the shop for over 3 weeks after a 10 mph encounter with a curb.  The wheel support arm was bent slightly, and the wheel speed sensor needed work.  Not only did it take a week to get the parts, but the dealer was less than knowledgeable about their product, tacking on another week.  This is all costing around $2500, by the way.

Another important note:  Audi built the computer diagnostic system into the stock radio.  What is one of the most common things car buffs do?  That's right- upgrade the sound system (no, the Bose isn't good enough), in the process unknowingly crippling access to the sensor codes, computer, etc.

This morning I dug out the old stereo, thanking god I kept it, and took it to the dealer so they could temporarily re-install it for their computer checks.  It looks like I'm going to have to carry the damn thing around in order to ensure the car can be repaired in the future.  What a stupid design decision.

Bottom line:  buy it, but only if you won't be hard on it, and don't you DARE change the precious and barely adequate Bose stereo, lest you want to seal off access to the car's brain.<br><br>
