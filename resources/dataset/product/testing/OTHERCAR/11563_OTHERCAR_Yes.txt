            As a recent newlywed and instant stepmother, my little Sunbird,though much loved, was no longer suitable for my instant family.  The Jeep Cherokee is very economical, gets great gas mileage and handles great.  Contrary to popular belief, driving a sport utility vehicle after a small car is a snap.  I also love the fact I could buy almost the same body style I fell in love with five years ago.  Unfortunately, this Jeep model is not equipped with a rear cargo cover so I am uneasy leaving things in plain view.  This Cherokee also has very little interior storage space, two examples are the small glove box and the lack of side door pockets.  Nevertheless, I have had my Jeep for seven months and I love it.<br><br>
