            I bought this car because it was the only thing I could find that met my three must-have criteria:
1. Wagon! I don't have kids, but I'm just a wagon person. 
2. 5-speed Manual Transmission - where's the fun in driving an automatic?
3. Monthly payments under $250.00.
After discovering Honda and Toyota no longer offer *any* wagons, I decided to check out the Hyundai. I test-drove it against the Saturn wagon (only thing in same price range last November - none of the local Ford dealerships had a Focus yet and I never seriously considered a Daewoo) and found the handling on the Hyundai to be much more fun. It's got tons of extras that didn't cost me extra - I'm looking forward to AC in the summer for the first time. It's also rock-solid on wet roads and in heavy rain. However, I had an accident in snow - lost control on a turn and banged into an island in a parking lot. Relatively little damage to the front end, but it took a month to fix at a total cost of $5,000 (thank god for insurance!), and the morons who fixed it sent me out with NO WATER IN MY RADIATOR WHATSOEVER, so it overheated 3 miles away and had to be towed back for another 1 1/2 weeks for assorted strange fix-its.  
Overall, I'd say - Quite good for a first brand-new car. And until I can afford the BMW M-Coupe (that's the Z3 in wagon form - looks KILLER in candy apple red!), it'll just have to do. <br><br>
