            I love my car ok?  I've waited a long time for this baby!  I have a 1998 Honda Accord LX. I bought it brand new at the end of 1998, so it just turned a year old.  It even still has that &quot;new car&quot; smell!  I can fit five passengers into it comfortably.  And you know what?  It has tons of leg room!  I know my teenage kids are very grateful.

When I get into my car and start it up, I don't have to worry.  It starts right up, and I swear, it almost purrs.  It's so quiet, I find myself really listening for the engine.  It gives me very smooth ride, and there's lots of get up and go!  It's easy to clean and care for too.  I take it in for service approximately every 3,000 miles.  I know it will probably last me at least 300,000 miles!  I know I'm optimistic, but hey, it's a Honda, what can I say?

If you've ever owned a Honda before, you probably won't go back to anything else.  If you don't own one, take it from me, you won't waste your money.  Go out and buy or lease one today!<br><br>
