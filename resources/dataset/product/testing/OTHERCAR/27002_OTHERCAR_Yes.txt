            Got Pictures?

I got it.  For a Christmas present last year.  One of those, &quot;What do you want for Christmas this year?&quot; and I answered &quot;the Olympus 450&quot; things.

If you're reading this, you're probably an informed shopper so I won't bore you with the details/specs of the camera.  Instead here are the descriptions of the BEST features of the camera.

1.  Zoom.  It's a 3x zoom (equivalent to 35-105 on a 35 mm camera).  Should be plenty for most.
2.  Flash.  It has a pretty powerful flash.  Since LIGHT is the essence to all photography, I recommend using flash almost all the time (manually turn it on), even if you're outside (as fill-in flash).  Okay, this will kill the already short battery life, but you'll get GREAT pictures.
3.  Macro.  If you use the 1.8&quot; screen to take pics, you can press the STAR button and choose &quot;Macro.&quot;  This enables you to focus things that are very, very close to the lens.  You can have fun taking pics of your fingernail, or someone's eye only, etc.

Drawbacks include:

1.  Short battery life.  Especially if you use a lot of flash and the LCD screen.  I recommend using the NiMH rechargeables (last longer than alkalines per charge, plus you can reuse).
2.  Slow download to your computer.  It comes with a serial cable included.  If you plan on downloading often, I recommend getting a USB SmartMedia reader (or if you have a notebook computer, get the PC Card adapter) to speed up the download ten- or maybe even a hundred-fold.

The optics on the Olympus are superior to other brands.  I've owned/used a Kodak and a Casio before and neither are even close in quality to the Olympus.

Enjoy.<br><br>
