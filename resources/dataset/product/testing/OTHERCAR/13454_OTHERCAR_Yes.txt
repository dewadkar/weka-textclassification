            I bought this car 6 months ago because of its miles, 70,000, and it's price. I want something reliable with good gas mileage. The car has extremely fast acceleration for a car of its size and it gets about 32 mpg. We had to replace the muffler and the idle is a bit rough being a 3 cylinder, but overall its not bad. My husband would rather fix our cars himself but this engine is so tightly packed its very hard to work on.
We had a rear bolt that rattled that had to be tightened.
For anyone in the back seat a long trip is really cramped. My next used car will be a little bigger 4 cylinder. This is a good car for college students, city drivers or retirees.
We'll keep it until it doesn't run anymore.<br><br>
