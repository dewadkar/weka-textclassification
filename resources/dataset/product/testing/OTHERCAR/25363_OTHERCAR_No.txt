            Capturing pictures digitally can save time and money�Agfa digital cameras enable users to do it without compromising image quality. A serial cable connects the camera to a Mac or PC, and images can be quickly and easily downloaded, organized and edited for a wide variety of applications.

The ePhoto CL30 Clik! is the new version of the highly popular ePhoto CL30. This feature-packed megapixel USB camera uses the Iomega� Clik! drive and 40MB Clik! disks. You can shoot up to 360 VGA resolution images (640 x 480 pixels) or even 60 high resolution images (1440 x 1080 pixels) on a single Clik! disk. This means there's no need to transfer images onto another medium to free space on your camera, or for archiving. The hot-pluggable USB interface built into the camera transfers your images at a very high speed to your computer.
