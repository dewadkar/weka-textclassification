            Update as of 6/2002. My car is now 3 1/2 years old and I still love it. It looks and performs like it did when it was brand new. I have had virtually no problems with it. The only one recently was during the winter (I live in MA) when the windshield cracked a bit. My insurance carrier covered a new one and it was easily replaced. If you have any questions about this car, e-mail me. 

<b>Did I always want a BMW?</b> No, I used to want a Jaguar, somewhere along the way my tastes changed. After driving my father's Cadillac that I inherited and selling our house, we found ourselves with the money to buy a new car. And yes, I will admit I wanted a BMW. I wanted the "name" and all that the name implies. I am quick to point out, however, that it is the "baby" BMW being the 300 series.

The fact that this car is the ultimate driving machine was certainly a bonus. Yes, it does give you an amazing ride.<b> It corners, turns and moves like no other car I've driven.</b> Literally, when making a sharp turn, you stay upright while the car does the turning. (In other cars you'll find that you turn with the car, making it the kind of experience where you hold on to something!)

<b>This car get 23 miles to the gallon in the city and 32 miles to the gallon in highway driving.</b>

I also love some of the bells and whistles ALTHOUGH, the 300 series (323IS) does not have the bells and whistles that the Cadillac has, even the bottom of the line Catera. But <b>it has dual heating operations; the driver can be toasted at 80 degrees while the passenger can freeze at 60!</b>

I live in the Northeast and this car actually tells me (a bell rings) when the temperature hits 38 degrees. This is to warn the driver that it is getting cold and to be careful the road might be slippery. It is an incredibly comfortable car, the seats are comfortable as is the ride itself. 

I miss some of the bells and whistles my Cadillac had. I miss the electric seats; mine have to be moved manually. An option which is very nice and I would recommend is heated seats. You can order that if you special order the car. I bought mine off the lot.<b> I also miss the roominess especially since I bought the 2 door. I like the look of it better than the 4 door BUT if I had to do it over again I would get the 4 door. The convenience of easily accessing the back seats is worth it. The back seat is tight but we do put 2 adults in the back and no one has complained yet!</b>

<b>I have the sports package which means I have special tires.* That means that I have to have snow tires put on (this wouldn't apply if you live in Florida:) in the Fall and taken off in the Spring. That costs an extra $100 2 times a year, but the car drives in the snow like you aren't even driving on snow.</b> It has an all traction system that goes into effect if you slide and it has a manual transmission option (I have automatic) that you can easily turn on if it's icy. I was able to get up icy hills no one else could maneuver.

<b>I also find the service excellent.</b> I think this is NOT related to my dealer, but to BMW in general. My car goes in for regular maintenance and gets cleaned inside and out! I had a small rust spot recently and it was fixed it in one day; it was under warranty and I got a rental car for free. I find that I'm treated like royalty..it's very nice.

<b>I love my silver, baby, BMW.</b>
