            I have to admit that I got my camera as a bonus as work.  I had been wanting one for so long.  I was a bit worried about the technology, but now I'm convinced.

This camera is easy to use.  The features are easy to navigate.  It takes great photos in a variety of lighting conditions and ranges.  It can even get a good photo when the LED screen shows nothing (I can get pictures of my cats at night.)  The JPEG compression is effective -- I shoot most photos at 640x480 FINE, and get about 16 photos per disc.  And the Mavica even puts a little HTML index on the floppy: a very nice touch; it makes each floppy browsable in any web browser.

The disk drive is very nice, since I can just stick in a new disk when I fill one.  It does drain the batteries a bit.  But the drive is actually accelerated: considerably faster than an old PC floppy drive, which is a GOOD thing.

The battery life is about 90 minutes, during which time I can get 100 photos or more.  Fewer if the flash is needed.  That's good enough for me.  Not good enough for someone who wants to take a real long hike and take lots of photos.  The replacement batteries are expensive, so carrying a bunch of spares would be a drag.

My only complaint is the auto focus.  It does focus very well most of the time, but I would like to turn it off and use the manual focus sometimes.  Haven't figured out how to do that yet.  And I would like an actual &quot;Exposure&quot; setting, rather than White intensity, Flash level, etc.
