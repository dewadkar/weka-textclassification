            The GEO Metro is one of the most dependable cracker boxes sold today.   Despite is small size, it is still pretty roomy in the front two seets.   I have a 4 door, and the back leg room is pretty uncomfortable, but then again, I am 6'1".    

Size (Pros Cons)

The small compact car eases in and out of traffic with ease, it handles like a small sports car.  My major concern is what will happen to the little beauty when it gets hit.  I'm sure it won't take much to total it.   

Maintance

My little bute has 183,000 on the odomiter, and I havn't done a thing to the engine, infact, I'm very bad about oil changes, its doing good to see an oil change every 10 thousand miles (NOT RECOMMENDED).    Tires are EXTREMELY CHEAP, I bought 4 tires at wallmart, total bill was 95 dollors to have the rotated and installed.     The car is so light, I can seem to go forever on tires and breaks.   

Over all.....

I love the little guy.   Its got a 3 cylinder, performance is great with just me inside, but add a friend or two and it takes a while to pick up speed.   Thats the sacrafice when one gets 54mpg.    When gas was high, close to 2 bucks, I drove the little bugger everywhere.  

My Thoughts

If you don't wan't to impress anyone with looks, and your looking for a dependable, inexpensive car to drive, this is it.  I've had two, and I'll have another one.
