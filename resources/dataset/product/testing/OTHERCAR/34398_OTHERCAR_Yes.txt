            Fairy Godmother are you listening?  I've been a very good girl and I really, really want this car!!  WHY?  Because not only is this car pleasing to the eyes, it is a safe performer with all the cool up-to-date features and it's at a price that can't be beat these days.  The warranty's not bad either!

People hear the name Hyundai and most likely they turn up their nose, sneering and remembering those people who had all sorts of problems with their little coupes in the late 80s early 90s.   Yes, back then those little affordable cars were pretty much just junk.  But Hyundai has come a long way - and Tiburon is definitely proof that Hyundai has come back with a vengeance!  They are determined to win popular opinion, and with this car I bet they will.

To begin with, Tiburon may look like a crunchmobile, but it's actually designed with a lot of safety features.  Standard features include dual airbags, a steel reinforced structure, and front and rear crumple zones.  The projector-type halogen headlamps and the rear combination lamps are both highly visible and distribute bright illumination.  Tiburon's standard 4-wheel disc brakes can come with the antilock braking system which works on each wheel independently for extreme braking situations. Tiburon's suspension includes gas-filled macpherson struts and front and rear stabilizer bars for excellent handling and cornering.  

The standard features are enough to go "Wow" about. On the inside they include second-generation dual airbags, 2.0-liter, 16-valve, 140-hp dohc engine, 5-speed manual overdrive transmission, cfc-free air conditioning, power everything, 4 speaker stereo/cassette, cruise control and 15" aluminum alloy wheels.  Standard interior features include front passenger assist grips, full carpeting, digital quartz clock, full center console w/coin holder and storage box, dual cupholder, front door map pockets, lockable glove box, reclining bucket seats w/adjustable headrests, remote fuel door, hood, and cargo releases, collapsible steering column, rear child safety seat anchor and front seatbelt pretensioners w/force limiters.

Standard on the outside includes a fixed mast antenna, bumpers, door handles, tinted glass, and dual power mirrors. You can get a 2000 Tiburon in the following colors: silver, orange, blue, green, red, white, and black.  I really want a yellow one, but that's 2001, where they must have dropped green for yellow.  

Optional features are spiffy and you can get all the latest and the greatest toys such as: cd/6 speaker stereo, leather interior, power tilt sunroof, courtesy lamps, halogen fog lamps and a rear wiper/washer. 

Ok, so now you know that I've read all about this car and I'm really into it.  But besides all this fascinating technical mumbo-jumbo - THE CAR JUST LOOKS GOOD, OK?
I mean, today there is really a big need for cars with style.  It seems like all the cars look the same out there on the road. Unless you're driving a VW Bug or Chrysler's stylin mobile, most likely one can't tell what kind of car you have until they see the name.  Not true with Tiburon.  It definitely has it's very own look and it's closest resemblence would be to a Mitsubishi Eclipse, yet Tiburon seems to scream, "I'm still cuter!"  Plus, it's a lot less expensive and has a better warranty!

I hope I will be able to get this car!  It would be the best graduation present!
