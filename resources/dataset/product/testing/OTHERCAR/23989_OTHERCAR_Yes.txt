            Bought this camera end of may 2003 at Radio Shack where it was being phased out. They now carry the type II which has the video option. This was the tiniest camera I had ever seen. Looking at its pin hole aperture I could only assume that the picture quality would be awful. Picking it up, it feels light and toy like. Sticker on back says made in China.  It has metal-look all plastic body. The lens itself is plastic. The shutter and (multi-function) power button however are made of metal and have a solid quality feel when pressed. It takes one AAA battery which is a quarter the size of the whole camera. It comes packaged with a quality USB cable, a useful mount to attach it to the top of a lap top screen, and a software CD. It seemed like I was getting quite a lot for my money so I was wondering what the catch was. The instruction book is as tiny as the camera but as thick as a phone book. SiPix apparently take this camera seriously. The lens markings state 640x480 VGA F3.0. f=6.3mm. 

The software loaded easily and is amazingly good quality with simple to figure out interface and many features. Above expectations. Mount camera on lap top (looks like it would mount on an LCD monitor also) USB cable plugs into the side of camera and then back of lap top. Do this before booting up for best result (as I learned). Whole set up looks pretty impressive! 

Click get pics and they are quickly all downloaded and displayed together on one screen. When you highlight with the mouse they jump out larger and then you can choose the save option. This camera holds at least 33 pictures at a time. The quality is about as good as the worst pinhole box camera, but it's all there. You can take as many as you want and its all free. You can take pictures of yourself with a mouse click using the time delay feature if you want. Instantly you've got fresh picture to email. You can take this camera anywhere. I wish it came with a little leather pouch though. When you press the shutter it makes a noise so you know you've taken a picture. The number of pics is displayed at the rear screen along with battery level. This camera is definitely useful for taking pictures for email. Everything shows up, but yes there is a slight spherical distortion at edges of pics and there is grain but the essentials are there. The distortion of the actual picture is not quite as bad as it looks when using the view finder. It is disappointing for anything panoramic though. Better for people. Great head shots. This camera will not work in low light and will double beep to indicate, but does work indoors in normal good daylight conditions. Great for shooting every room of a house, or for getting a picture to sell your car or some item on ebay, or for insurance purposes etc. It was great for telling email stories with accompanying pics while I was traveling. 

This camera has a serious draw back due to the low price. A cheap battery may last even less than 24 hours. A quality battery only about 48 hours. This means you can not take this camera on vacation without the computer. When the battery goes all the pics go too. You basically have to use it and download the pictures the same day. Also, You can not easily turn this camera off once activated. It has an automatic shut of feature which takes about a minute of no use to take effect. 

The fact that it did all the things the package said it would thrilled me beyond expectation. I'm glad I bought it and I have got a lot of use from it.  Functional little web cam.
