            I recently attended Cadillac�s �World Challenge� event, at which you get to drive Cadillac�s vehicles and Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar and Lincoln vehicles side-by-side on a track. So I got a chance to compare C320 and its competition � Cadillac Catera and Lincoln LS.

Finally, something exciting <b>and</b> affordable from Mercedes-Benz � a C-Class with available manual transmission. The new 3-rd generation 2001 Mercedes-Benz C-class is completely new. It goes on sale in the USA in C240 and C320 models.

When I said �affordable� I meant: the value content of new offerings increased significantly comparing to the previous� C-Class, but the prices remained low. Both models feature a long list of standard equipment. Even leather seating surfaces are standard. Also standard is a dynamic stability program, several airbags... C-Class has the Head Protection Side Air Bag Curtain, which deploys across the side windows.

If you check out the results of crash tests (crashtest.com), you will see that, despite popular belief, previous models of Mercedes-Benz didn�t do particularly well. The new C-Class has is more rigid chassis, front and rear crash boxes to absorb the impact forces in a "fender bender" and leave the structural frame members of the car undamaged. And it also provides rear passengers with a door-mounted side-impact air bag. The C-Class's brake pedal has been designed to break away in the event of an accident. All this pays off � the recent crash test results show that the new C-class has excellent crash protection.

The C240 gets a new 2.6-liter V6 engine, which has 3 valves per cylinder and twin spark plugs, all of which helps reduce emissions and increase torque, and a 6-speed manual (!) transmission as a standard equipment. MB didn�t offer manuals in C-Class here for a long time. The engine produces 168 hp @ 5,500 rpm and 177 lb-ft @ 4,500 rpm. Unfortunately, it requires premium (91) gas.

As you can see, Mercedes-Benz follows BMW in �misnaming� its models. 2.6-Liter model should in theory be called C260 - last year's BMW 2.5-Liter was called 323 instead of 325. But they decided to name the car C240 for marketing reasons, so people will not compare it to older C260 in Europe.

BMW�s new 2.5-liter engine in 3-series produces 184 hp and the suspension seems more refined � both more sporty <b>and</b> better on uneven pavement.

The C320, that I drove, gets a 3.2-liter V6 and 5-speed automatic, unfortunately no manual transmission is available. The engine produces 215 hp @ 5,700 rpm and 229 lb-ft @ 3,000 - 4,500 rpm. Also requires premium gas.

<b>On The Track</b>
During the even you perform full-throttle accelerations, hard braking and involve in slalom-like activities, where you have to either slow down or spin the steering wheel really fast. Although the car I drove was a C320 without the sport package, it was competitive with Caters Sport (which had noticeably heavier steering and stiffer suspension) and completely outran Lincoln LS that felt large, heavy and had slow steering (but excellent brakes, I must admit).

The steering felt a bit weird, requiring some getting used to, but after a while was fast. Even the standard suspension is quite fun to drive. The car feels solid and the 5-speed automatic shifts fast and does not experience �thinking periods�, unlike Lincoln LS�s, which took some time to decide to downshift.

The new engines feature less internal friction than previous designs, and the use of only one exhaust valve helps decrease the heat losses and emissions. Two spark plugs per cylinder fire with delay after one another, which is based on the engine load and driving conditions.

The chassis is stiffer than previous generation C-class and looks very attractive, closely resembling the S-class. It has one of the lowest drag coefficient values in its segment (0.27). It looks very good, much better than the old C-class in my opinion. It looks much like S-class and the impression is that C-class is bigger than it really is.

The steering setup changed from recirculating ball to rack-and-pinion, which improves responsiveness and crash protection. This, along with the standard 6-speed manual of C240, makes it a fun to drive and somewhat more competitive to BMW�s offerings. I still prefer BMW 3-series for its sharp looks, straight 6 cylinder engine (versus V-6 in C-class) and better suspension.

The base price for the C240 model starts at around $30K, which means that the new C-class is a good value - almost everything is standard, so the list of options is pretty short. It looks, at least on paper, a good competitors to BMW�s 3-series, in terms of value. And the 6-speed manual in C240 is a definite plus. However, it would be nice if they offer the manual transmission in C320.

The interior is either wood or aluminum accents with sport trim available. I think that BMW 3-series sounds like a better alternative to the sport trim, it has better rough road compliance. I don�t like C-class� interior, but it�s just a matter of personal preference.

<i>The switches that operate windows are quite weird - to make the window go down, you have to push them up and vice versa.</i>

The steering wheel has buttons to control radio, optional phone and such. The gauges are very large. I think that dash is kinda boring, but I can see that a lot of people will like it. If somebody gave me C320 as a gift, I�d love it too :-) !

The C320 gets 21 MPG in city driving and <b>32</b> MPG on the highway, mostly due to its sleek aerodynamics, 5-speed transmission and low internal friction.

BMW�s 3-series with leather interior, rear side airbags, cruise control and wood trim costs about the same as C240, so I hope that the prices on BMWs will go down as a result of competition.
