            I researched this camera on epinions and settled on it by bidding on it at the BestBuy site.  The camera is less expensive now and I considered it a bargain when I bought it 9 months ago.  I have delayed writing a review until we  used it under different conditions and for different reasons.

I will not go into the details of the camera as that is well listed in other reviews. Instead I will describe our family-type experiences.  We are not even semi-professionals in photography but have taken many pictures over 50 years.  

I turned the camera over to my husband who is the family photographer.  He immediately began taking pictures and showing them on the TV  as well as his computer and even printing them out.  He was still attached to his old fashioned 35 mm film cameras.  He liked the instant photos and the ability to delete what he didn't want.  He enjoyed comparing it to our other cameras.

Since I had been scanning over 40 years of photos to transfer to CDs, I was looking forward to less scanning in the future. 

Since the camera takes 3 sizes of pictures, we experimented with showing the 3 sizes on the TV and if we could distinguish the difference.  We were concerned with the camera memory for a planned Baltic cruise.  We finally bought accessories and cards to solve that problem.  

My husband also took his film camera and plenty of film on the trip.  The trip offered plenty of opportunities to take photos under all kinds of light conditions.  One of the best features of the camera is you don't need flash in museums who frown on flash.  The camera does very well in average light, at least good enough for home photos.  With the 3X zoom you can get wonderful pictures you are not quite close enough to.  The viewer is a great help in determining your photo and you can take a series of pictures because of the short shutter interval of 1.7 seconds.  You don't need a more expensive model which has video options.

Since the camera is so small and convenient it is easy to take pictures from all angles such as a  canal boat in  
Amsterdam.  The flash worked when needed and avoided red eye.  Although digitals are reputed to take poor photos in low light this camera seemed to do quite well.  It is easy to edit pictures and store them after a day of shooting.  You are much more likely to organize your photo right away rather than throwing prints in a box for future organization.

We ended up not using our traditional camera or any of the film we bought because the digital camera was so convenient. 

Showing the pictures on a TV screen to friends and family is much pleasanter than the old methods of prints or slide shows.

The digital storing method is more convenient .  I am currently scanning 43 years of photo events to store on CDs and it is a tedious and lengthy procedure.  Now we only have to be aware of technical advances which make our present picture preservation obsolete.
