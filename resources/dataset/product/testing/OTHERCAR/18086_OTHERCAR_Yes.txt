            This being my first car, I love the Neon. After Purchasing it for $3,750 with 65,000 miles on it(practically a steal),it is in very good shape, I had to take it out on the country roads. Being a 22yr old male that I am I had to test how fast I could make it go. Well I got it up to 110mph with absolutley no problems. It can handle turns very well , it will take a take tight at 95mph with ease. Now I am not promoting that you speed everyday you can, I am just saying that the little car has some spunk to it. Hell, on the way back from work I beat out an Eclipse. 

 Not knowing much on cars, I do know that the gas mileage is around 250-265miles/gallon on a full tank, which will roughly cost you around $12-15 to fill up(depending on gas cost now a days of course). 

It is a cozy little car great for work transportation or just cruising around, it is no chick magnet but it does have it s own character to it. The only problems that I see with the Neon is leg room and brakes. I am 6'5&quot; now, I know you are trying to figure out how I would drive a neon, simple. I scoot the sit all the way back and tilt the seat back as well. This leaves me with leg room enough to turn and brake safely. 
Ok now the brakes, once again This may just be my car, the brakes are very slow to respond you must plan ahead to brake. however, if you are in an emergency and need to brake the car will respond if enough pressure is applied. 

The simple look of the neon makes it a unique and very fun car to drive.
