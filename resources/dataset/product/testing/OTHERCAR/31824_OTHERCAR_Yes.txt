            We owned a 1983 Honda Accord.  We drove it to death.  When it came time for a new one we were very disappointed.  The 1996 Accords were not up to the same standard.  So we purchased something else.  Now it is 2000 and we thought we would take another look.  This time a Civic.  We drove it.  It is the same old Honda of yesteryear.  We loved it.  It had great pick up.  Stopped on a dime.  The gas mileage, WOW.  I hope it can fulfill that!  We were very surprised.  For the cost and the amount of car you get, it appears to be a great value.  If it can last 13 years and 135,000 miles it will be a great car.  
The color choices a dull.  The best looking is the Iced Teal.  The others are boring.  They need a red or something like that.  I could find no other complaints.  Our plan it to by a Iced Teal, LX model.  I think it will make a great commuter and a car that will be around for years to come.<br><br>
