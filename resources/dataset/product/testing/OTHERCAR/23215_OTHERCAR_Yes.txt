            This is a good digital camera for someone wanting to get into digital photography.  It's easy to use.  The shape and feel of the camera is very much like a traditional non-digital point and shoot.

As you might expect from Kodak, the images themselves are quite good.

The biggest downfall of this camera is that there's no optical zoom.  The digital zoom is difficult to use.  Since it's not optical, you have to use the display screen when shooting with it to see what you'll really get -- you can't tell by using the viewfinder.  This makes it quite difficult for outdoor shots where the screen can be tough to see.  The camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when using the display screen.  And even at only 3X the zoom makes the picture quite grainy and pixelated, so I pretty much gave up on using it and considered it to be a camera with no zoom.

The DX3600 is not much more, but it does have an optical zoom - not much, but enough to make it much more useful than the 3500.  My suggestion if you get this camera is to not use the zoom, even if it looks like it would make a better shot.  Instead, shoot without it, then crop the photo later on your PC.  You'll avoid the pixelation problem, and if you shoot at the highest resolution, you'll still have a decent size photo, especially if it's for sharing via the web or e-mail, but even small prints will be okay.

Also be aware that replacing the batteries can get expensive.  I suggest purchasing a charger and rechargable battery pack.  That does, of course, offset one of the nice benefits of this camera -- the price.

I used this camera for a few weeks then sold it on Ebay and used the money for a DX3600.  You can find both models regularly on Ebay as factory refurbs (although most were probably never even used) , but don't get too carried away with the bidding, as I've seen some of them go for almost the price of new ones.
