            the ram 1500 series is by far the best line of trucks out on the road today! I am a car dealer and I get alot of cars in every year but everytime I see a dodge ram I have to buy it, even if I will lose on the resale. 
the looks are quite astonashing . If you notice dodge came out with the rounded front end and the massive hood, and then everybody else followed. Dodge is also the one that came out with the quad cab on there 1500's !
 This truck has got it all it has the best engine on the road and great handiling. the interior is superb, also it has enough room for a laptop in the console and two extra power plugs to make sure it wont go dead. And I by far think that the seats are the most comftorable seats ever made I am even going to put one in my house!<br><br>
