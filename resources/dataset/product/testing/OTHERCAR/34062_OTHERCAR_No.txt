            By creating the Neon, lowly Chrysler  has sunk even lower. The Neon is perhaps the worst compact car I have ever been in. The seats actually HURT. My friends and family noted this within the first ten minutes of riding in it. A horrible stinging sensation can be felt along your entire spine. Also, the seatbelts tighten by themselves, and eventually long road trips become comparable to a visit to a Siberian gulag. But that isn't the worst of it.
The first thing I noticed about this car was the constant ticking sound thee driver's side door made when it was open. This only occurred when the car was off. Very odd, but not much of a problem. The worst came when the brakes failed. The brake pedal froze and refused to move. I had to use the emergency brake so that I would fly through a stop sign and directly into an oncoming tractor-trailer. The dealer fixed this, but now the Mickey Mouse job that they did has come back to haunt me. Even when slightly pressing the brakes, it makes a horrible squealing sound, and when the pedal is released, it creaks.
The auto transmission is also a problem. It can never decide which gear to be in, so whenever I go up a hill, it shifts between gears about every two seconds. The whole car lurches forward with every shift, whether I'm shifting from neutral to drive, reverse to drive, etc.
The engine also sounds like its about to die. When you turn the car off, the engine continues to shake and sputter for about five seconds.
Remember the Neon may look like an economical car at first, but the will leave you crying in physical and financial agony.<br><br>
