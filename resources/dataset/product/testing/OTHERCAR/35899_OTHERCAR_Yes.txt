            It all started after a visit to Chicago and I drove a buddy�s 99� M3 coupe around for a day.  I had never had a driving experience like it before.  The car looked incredible and would get-up-and-go faster than anything I had previously driven.  Obviously there are quicker cars out there but I had not sat in them.

I came home and set my sights on owning one.  I thought I should buy new but found out that the new model wasn't due out until the fall of 2000 and they no longer make the sedan!  I know it is going to blow the current series away but I just couldn't wait.  I wanted the Silver exterior with Grey interior.  I wanted a 4 door, so I can throw the kids in when the truck is being worked on and I wanted all the options.  I looked and looked (if you have a vision, you have to be patient) and finally found it  - a 1998 with 33,000 miles on it and the car is even better than I remembered.  

Why because:
1.) It is fast, fast, fast!!

2.) It is the sexiest looking sedan on the street, especially with the spoiler

3.) The sound system is incredible - you have to get the Harman-Kardon Sound System with the 6 disc to know what I am talking about

4.) There is plenty of room in the trunk to carry clubs, luggage, a stroller or most anything else in this size range and even bigger with the seats laid down

5.) The seats are comfortable and wrap around you

6.) All the instruments are within easy reach

7.) The on-board computer gives tons of data - mileage, average speed, distance/time to location, temperature and status of the car

8.) The brakes are steel drums and are the same as the 7 series.  Good to know when you need to be able to slow down quickly!

9.) The air blows cold.  It is also nice to have dual zone for the driver and passenger.  It may sound silly to have dual zone in a sports car but it isn't.

I don't like saying there is anything wrong with the car but there are some things to be aware of:
1.) All the windows and sunroof have 1 touch open.  And all the windows have 1 touch close but the sunroof you have to hold (they may have fixed this in 99 &amp; 2001)

2.) The rims get dirty quick.  I wash mine every weekend even if I don't wash the whole car.  It's like making the bed, even if the rest of the room is a mess, the bed makes it look clean.  The same is true for the wheels on the M3, just buy some simple green and wipe them clean.

3.) The back seat is a little tight but much easier to manage with four doors

4.) An extra power plug would be nice.  If I plug my cell phone in, I have to unplug my radar.  I am fixing that by ordering a wire that lets me connect it to the fuse box directly but and extra plug would still be nice.

5.)  I am a speeding ticket waiting to happen.  I just bought my first radar detector because it is cheaper than the lawyer fees I would have to pay if I got caught!

As you can see my recommendations for change are minor in comparison to all you get with this car.  I have a hard time not telling people I meet that I drive the M3.  Sure it is fun to brag a little but driving the car is such an experience I have to let people know about it.  I finally understand why people like to get out and just drive.  From the minute you put the seat belt on and turn the key you know you have a lot of power at you fingertips.  And it�s ok to unleash the power because the car sticks to the road like nothing I have ever seen before.  The third gear is huge and will push you back in your seat.  Even in fifth gear you still have plenty of power so sitting at 80 MPH and wanting to pass does not mean changing gears.  Oh by the way, the M3 is an incredible car to drive at the speed limit too!  The engine is saying, �Please go faster!� but respects your wishes and handles like a dream.

People, if you are concerned about saving money on your next car, not getting tickets or comfortably seating full-grown adults in your back-seat for a long ride than look at another car.  If you want a car that will turn heads, drive fast and forever, then the M3 is for you!
