            After looking at all the competing minivans out there, we got another Plymouth Voyager when the lease was up on our '96 Voyager SE. Our '99 is an Expresso model with all the bells &amp; whistles, including the &quot;N&quot; package which dresses up the interior like a Town &amp; Country.

We have the 3.3L V6 engine which provides peppy acceleration.  The 4-speed automatic transaxle shifts very smoothly and at the right times (unlike earlier versions of this tranny that I've experienced).  My only complaint about this powertrain is the fuel economy--we are averaging about 20 MPG, which is almost 3 MPG less than our '96 Voyager with the 3.0L V6 and 3-speed (non-overdrive) transaxle averaged.

One of the best features of the Voyager is its incredible maneuverability.  This thing will turn on the proverbial dime!  The wide stance allows the front wheels to really turn in, which translates to a very tight turning circle.  In fact, the Voyager turns in a shorter circle than does my '94 Dodge Spirit, which has a 10-inch shorter wheelbase!

The visibility out of this vehicle is fantastic.  The driving position is also very good, especially with the adjustable steering wheel column and power driver's seat.  It's a great place to be for an extended trip.  

Our Voyager has the handling package, which stiffens the ride somewhat but probably improves handling, especially when the vehicle is loaded down.  The ride is very good, much like a nice-riding car's.  It's also a very quiet cruiser, with very little engine or road noise heard in the passenger compartment.

Even though many manufacturers have brought out new-design minivans over the past few model years, the Plymouth Voyager (and the kissin'-cousin Dodge Caravan) still seem to offer the best combination of performance, utility, interior comfort and perhaps best of all, PRICE.    <br><br>
