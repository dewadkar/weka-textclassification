            Maybe i'm just partial to acuras, but the integras are really nice, and their price will go WAY down after this year because they're not making them anymore.  Acura's going to stop making the integra and honda's stopping production of the preludes so that they can combine the two and make a superior interlude. So in a little while these beautiful machines will drop in price dramatically.  

But besides that they're powerful and beautiful.  I mean just looking at the car it's a &quot;head turner&quot; they're really beautiful to look at especially if you tint the windows put a nice exhaust on it, and maybe even throw on some sweet rims.  I mean these things pack POWER under the hood.  THe one my friend had was nice dohc v-6 with a few minor adjustments and it had liek 200 some odd horsepower for a really light car. 

Also on these cars the suspension is great, it's a fairly wide car, and it's low to the ground, so it's got pretty damn good handling.  But i mean besides that straight out of the factory these things are fast, reliable beautiful, and affordable.  They are by no means expensive especially for what you're getting.  I really like integras... but only the two door models... i think the four doors just look weird.  Then comes the integra type-r those things are just god like... if you can find a good deal on one of those i suggest you buy it even ifyou don't likesports cars because after one of those, i guarentee you'll love them.<br><br>
