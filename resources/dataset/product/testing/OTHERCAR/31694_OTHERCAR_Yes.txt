            When Pontiac boasts of driving excitement, it is this car that they are talking about.  The Grand Prix is a beautiful car, sporty and at the same time classy.  It can be a good family car or a good sports car.  It has enough room to store people and luggage alike, but it can also feel like a smaller sportscar.  It handles tightly and with ease and has a good smooth ride.

There are few bad things about the car.  I dislike the headrests quite a lot.  For city driving, they're fine.  However, on road trips, it's advisable to carry a pillow.  The open shape of them makes it difficult to get comfortable.  Also the seats feel a bit low and I feel like I have to sit up in the seat to see really well.  This is OK, but it does take getting used to.

Aside from that, its a good, fun car.  It has a tremendous amount of power and pickup.  It has a great factory stereo system that makes listening to the radio or CDs either one a pleasure.  It has never needed any unscheduled maintainence and has been very reliable on the cold mornings.  Overall, I love this car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good domestic ride.<br><br>
