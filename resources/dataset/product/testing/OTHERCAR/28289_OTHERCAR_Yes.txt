            I am the mother of four young children so when my husband and I set out to go car shopping, we had a challenge in front of us.  Our options we very limited, being that we needed a six passenger vehicle, but would like one to seat eight.  I was dreading the thought of only being able to seat that many in only a Van, I am not at the point where that is the car of choice.  My husband and I have owned a Toyota King Cab, a Chev Camero with T-Tops, and the last was a Olds Cutless Supreme, but as our family grew, the lack of space in the car also grew.

We ended up looking at the Durango, and it was love at first sight!  Ours seats eight very comfortably, the seats lift up so anyone getting in the back seats can do so with ease, it has every option we wanted and most of all, was in our price range.  I drove our new 99 Hot Chili Pepper Red Durango home about two weeks from the date we had ordered it.

The one down side to this Vehicle is its gas mileage.  We are currently only getting about 12 miles per gallon, but with the four wheel drive, we knew what we were getting into.

I would recommend this S.U.V to anyone of any age, when you have a big family, your only option is no longer just a van.<br><br>
