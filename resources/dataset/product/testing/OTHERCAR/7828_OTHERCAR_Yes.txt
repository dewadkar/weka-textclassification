            Being a true sport car enthusiast I could not have resisted when I have seen this vehicle for the first time. Fast, sleek, low fuel consumption and lots of horsepower. However, many other cars have those too, but not so many have been produced in a small number making it almost a collectable item.

I have been driving a Nissan 240SX convertible for a year now and am more than happy with the ways it handles not to speak how great it looks. Dropping down the top takes seconds (all you have to do is unlock two latches on the side and push the top down button, and when you want it up push the top up button and lock the latches in place, you can bring the top down and back up in less than two minutes.
As far as how well this vehicle drives and handles, I am speechless. I have taken it to the highway more than once and am amazed every time. The acceleration speed is quite good for 198HP 4-cylinder dual camshaft engine. When you press your gas pedal to the metal this car really makes you feel the G's.

Cons of this vehicle are very few, however they are worth mentioning. As with all 240 and 300 models the paint tends to peel a bit from a front of a nose, thus make sure you give it a proper maintenance when you first see it.

Furthermore, if you ever blow a fuse, your car will behave a bit funny (your dome light fuse will affect your antenna, radio as well as your clock to behave really strange). Furthermore, even though this car is a four seater, the back room is a bit tight. Front seats are OK for an average built person. However, if you are tall or large built, you might find yourself in a bit of a "tight situation". 

Lastly, because of its low profile, you have to be really careful when you enter or cross raised shoulders or hit the bump or pothole on the street since the bottom part of vehicle's nose will tend to scrape the asphalt when so happens. But as with every vehicle, there are some good features, there are some bad features but in this case the good features by far outweigh few glitches and inconveniences.

Last but not the least, this vehicle is quite great on gas considering that it is rated as a sport car. You can get approximately 260 - 270 miles on a 10 - 12 gallons within the city driving and even more if you drive highway which is not that bad for a sport car.

Overall, looking at all pros and cons, this is a great vehicle. Rarely if never it breaks down and once you get to know it and get to feel for it you will get many great hours as well as many great looks from envious bystanders. If you have had it all and are looking for something different than this is a car for you, if you can locate one since, like said previously, they have had been built in a quite small numbers making them a true jewel to own.
