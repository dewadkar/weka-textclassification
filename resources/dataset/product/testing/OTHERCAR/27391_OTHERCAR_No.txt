             I recently leased a 2002 Dodge Caravan after ending my lease of a 1999 Dodge Caravan. We leased the base model, as we did with the 1999, thinking we would be pleased again. The new model, although a smooth ride, and so far is mechanically trouble-free, is lacking in quality. We loved our 1999, but I can't wait until I can turn in the 2002!
 The first difference that I noticed is that there is no key entry to the rear  sliding doors. The 1999 model had this. I did not realize how annoying not having  this feature could be. We have to unlock the front door and reach inside to the back door, pull up the lock, and then go back and open the door from the exterior. Sound like a  minor complaint? Try this maneuver with a small child or a bag of groceries in your hands! It doesn't work! You need to get automatic locks to avoid this annoyance, which we did not know. Also, the day after we brought the van home the passenger side window handle came off in my hands!
  The upholstery is a poor quality as well. Yes, we did by the base model, but had the same model with the 1999, and we were pleased with that van. The back of the seats are now cloth, not vinyl, and the kids have already stained them only three months into the lease. The cup holders as well, are very cheesy and drinks fall out of it easily, which ruins the carpet.
  The van does hold the standard 7 passengers, which is great for carpooling. Tether attachments for child safety seats are included, as well as attachments for the new LATCH system child safety seats. This feature allows you to install your child seats securely with out using a seatbelt. 
  There are also no longer any press on lights above the rear view mirror. Another convenience that is now gone. The control panel is very similar to the previous model and is easy to operate.
  The lease payment was not easy to negotiate and it went up a lot. We paid 179.99 a month for the 1999,36 month term, with $1500 down.  We now pay $279.99 a month, 52 month term,with $500 down, for a lesser quality van.
