            The Subaru Outback is one of the most innovative sedans made today.  The features, besides having a tape player, AM/FM radio, and other features.  The Outback has one both of the front passenger and driver's seats a seat warmer for those cold mornings when you get up and it is 30 degrees or something like that.  This is an example of hoe innovative the Outback can be.  Also the Outback is very affordable for a family with a limited budget.  I got mine for 27,000 dollars and you can get yours probably cheaper.  These cars are overall well built and has a good seating capacity for those families with 2 or 3 children.<br><br>
