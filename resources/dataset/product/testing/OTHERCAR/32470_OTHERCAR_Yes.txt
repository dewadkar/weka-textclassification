<TEXT>
            I bought this car 3 years ago, and it's the best thing I ever did. It's a 94 4 door with a 3.0L engine. It is more responsive in the passing lane than I ever imagined it would be. I ride for hours, and feel like it was just a short jaunt. 

The only accessory power point is the cigarette lighter, which is right near the gear shifter. So when I have my cell phone plugged in, I have to be careful when shifting, as it's easy to cause the plug to come loose enough to lose the connection. This is the only negative thing I can say about it. It is a shear pleasure to drive.<br><br>
