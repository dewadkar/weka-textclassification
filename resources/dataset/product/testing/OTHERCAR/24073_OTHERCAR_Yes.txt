            Wanted to &quot;add a little interest&quot; to my e-mails. Realized how much I enjoy getting photos from my friends (who are scattered across this country and Europe). Wanted to be able to send an occasional photo, too.

Since I had no &quot;professional&quot; interest in a digital, went for &quot;cheapest&quot; I could get with a 640x480 resolution. I also wanted a flash, and removable memory (didn't want to worry about having to &quot;trash&quot; pictures before I was ready.

Bought it, tried it, sent a picture to my computer at work and ended up having to get 2 more cameras for my coworker. The clarity of the picture was that good.

No problems using the camera itself or uploading to the computer. Had a few problems with using the software, not a lot of instructions came with the camera. Otherwise, I am very pleased and not out a lot of money.
