            After several months of researching the Audi A4 and BMW 3 series line of cars, I found that the interior space was too confining, especially in the back.  Even though I don't typically have back seat passengers, I wanted space for my adult friends on those nites on the town.  The A4 is way cramped back there and the front seat space is similarly tight.  The same is true about the BMWs (which have 'no' trunk room!).  But the German engineering (driver's car = great handling, performance) was a major factor eliminating the less expensive Accord/Camry/Maximas.

When I test drove the V6 Passat I was impressed at how similar it was to the A4.  I later found out that they are of the same company (Audi/VW/Porshe), share the same engine and many interior parts, and derive from the same wheelbase (except the Passat wheelbase is extended).  The difference is that the Passat has far more interior space and trunk space (golf clubs no problem).  And also, Passat is several thousand dollars cheaper for a comparably equipped model.  After shopping around the internet and contacting dealers, I was able to find one that matched my color and options package at a good price.  Many VW dealers operate with 4K mark up and there is a 2% dealer holdback on top of that.  The 2001 are selling very well and a new facelift for next year's midyear model is coming.  I got mine for Edmund's TMV price.

The ride in the Edmen, Germany manufactured/assembled Passat is true and sweet.  The accel is punchy on highways, although 0-60 is no sportscar due to size and weight.  The 18/26 MPG for V6 is nothing great and premium gas is recommended.  However, the handling and smooth ride mated with a unique tiptronic (auto and manual) tranny found on BMW/Audi/Porsche give it a classy feel.  The cabin is also very upscale and looks very similar to the A4's.  Seats are harder than Japanese cars, like all German cars.  The car also came std with ABS, alarm, laser cut keys, anti-slip, trac control, 6 airbags, 8 speakers, DRL, autolock, and a bunch of other features.  I also got the heated front seats, heated wipers, and leather seats.  All work well.

Who should buy - gen X-ers like me with 25-32K to drop on a nice sporty car.  Lots of middle aged people also get it for families.

and one last thing,... go get a test drive!
