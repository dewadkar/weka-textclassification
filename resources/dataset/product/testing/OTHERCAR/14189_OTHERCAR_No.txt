            We leased this new 1997 vehicle initially and loved it. After the 2 year lease was up we then purchased the vehicle. The LHS is an extremely comfortable car and has a luxurious look. It was an expensive car around $32,000.  There was a recall on the fuel ring which was taken care of with no difficulty. We also had to have the entire radio/cd/cassette player replaced at about 34,000 miles.  Every time we turned on the back window defogger while the radio was on we heard only static.  This replacement worked for a while, however the problem is happening again.
 
We have had problems with the transmission twice. We would put the car into reverse and it would not move forward or backwards. We then had to turn the car off(where ever we were sitting), turn it back on, or we would just have to put the car into drive;and then immediately into reverse and it would work.  It turned out to be a valve body in the transmission.  Recently at 47,000 miles the entire transmission had to be replaced.  According to the manual the &quot;check engine light&quot; should come on when there are problems with the transmission system(which it did not). <br><br>
