            First off I would like to say I loved my Suburban, however, I hated the recurring repair bills.  My wife and I decided to purchase a 1996 Chevy Suburban K1500 after we had our 3rd. child.  Everyone fit with plenty of room and the leather is great for accidents(i.e. spilled milk, juice, squashed cheeseburgers, etc.) and the vehicle is very functional for large families.  With all that being said lets talk about the numerous mechanical problems.  The first being one of the passenger windows came off its track the 2nd night we had it so back to the dealer we went.  A few weeks later I asked my wife if she would take it in and have all the fluids changed just for preventive measures.  After parking it on the street for 2 weeks because it would not stop leaking I took it back where my wife had it serviced, they put it up on the rack and pointed out all the leaking gaskets and to top it off the brakes need to be replaced along with a cv boot.  I was pretty upset after all it only had 68000 miles.  We ended up having to change the power steering gear box, the front axle shaft seals, the intake manifold gaskets, a cv boot, and the brakes. The mechanic at the Chevy dealer later told me the intake manifold gaskets are a common problem with the Vortec 350 engine(expensive problem) and the mechanic that changed out the front differential seals tells me he sees 15 of these a month and he had to do a special fix to prevent it from happening again.  Now that we have spent over $2k for repair bills my wife asks is this it?  I am thinking well we should be safe for a while. So we drove another 12 thousand miles and the air conditioning goes out and you guessed it another trip to the dealer.  I asked them to look it over and tell me what else may be wrong and to my astonishment the brakes need replaced again.  I am thinking what do I ride with my foot on the brakes all the time how can this bee.  Well the mechanic at the dealer tells me this is pretty common for the half ton Chevy Suburban.  So now your thinking why keep it!  Believe me I asked my self the same question over and over and finally we decided to sell it.  Later I decided to ask my brother-in-law how they like their 1999 Suburban and he basically said it was great except for the mechanical problems.  He has had some of the same problems I have.  In my opinion if you are going to pay $40,000 for a vehicle it better last alot longer than 68,000 miles before you have to spend money on repairs.  I have also learned that talking to dealer mechanics can uncover many potential problems, so before you spend thousands of dollars on a used Suburban please do your self a huge favor and have it checked out by a reputable mechanic.
