            <b><i>Snapshot:</i></b>  After owning my new A6 for 4 months, a couple of quirks have shown up but I still love the car and it is a joy to drive.

<b>Introduction</b>
My previous two reviews provided the details of my recent A6 buying experience, ref. #1, and my initial assessment of the car itself, ref. #2. The point of this epinion is to provide all of you fellow Audi owners and especially, prospective Audi owners, with some follow up now that the initial rush of excitement about my new car has dimmed. What do I think of it after using it for 4 1/2 months and will the romance last or was it just a brief infatuation?

<b>The Down and Dirty</b>
Frankly, I still think it is a great car. There have been a few minor annoyances, particularly one that I'm not real happy about, but overall, I don't think I could be happier with any other car. The Audi A6 2.7T caught my attention early and though I shopped the field, I have no regrets with my choice.

<b>She Still Delivers</b>
The car's performance, handling, braking, etc. are all still magnificent. Certainly nothing has &quot;broken&quot; or degraded and I haven't noticed any idiosyncrasies.

The car has performed perfectly in any situation that I've had it in over the last 4 1/2 months. I used it in the slushy, sloppy Colorado springtime snow and drove it up in the mountains to Vail over the 4th of July. When driving in poor winter conditions I feel much more secure and confident in the Audi than I ever did in my old Acura Legend and the Audi handles better than even my old 4 wheel drive truck. While driving in those conditions the Audi always gave me steady tracking up icy hills, no slip through slushy corners and secure, fish-tail free braking on snowy, sanded roadways. (Those of you who have driven in Colorado during the winter know that once the snow melts, the roads remain hazardous for several days until the sand &amp; gravel spread by CDOT is pushed aside.)

<b>She Maintains Her Cool Under Pressure</b>
When driving to Vail in the summer heat, climbing 6000 ft to the Eisenhower tunnel, back down 3000' to Dillon and then up 2000' and over Vail pass I had way more power, speed and acceleration than the surrounding traffic would allow me to fully use. Maintaining 70 mph up any incline, no matter the elevation, was a piece of cake. The car never once complained, the AC was on the whole time and the ride was as smooth and quiet as if I was puttering down my own street.

During this very hot Colorado summer, (53 days and counting with daytime highs over 90F), one pronounced advantage the A6 has demonstrated over any previous car I've owned, (primarily all from Japanese automakers), is how quickly and efficiently the climate control system in the A6 cools down the car's interior. Day after day at work I leave it parked in the hot sun with the windows rolled up and although it's hot when I first get in, the climate control never gives me enough time to break a sweat before its brought the interior temperature down to a reasonable level.

<b>New Relationship Issues, or, She's Only Human After All</b>
So, the car is every bit as thrilling to drive as when I first brought it home.  Now for the little odd things that have popped up....

First off, weird radio tuner problems. These happened sporadically less than ten times during the first month, went away and then came back just in the last few days. What usually happens is I drive someplace while listening to the radio, get there and turn off the ignition. When I return and restart the car, sometimes the tuner frequency doesn't return exactly to where it was when the car was shut off. For instance, it would be dialed to 93.3 FM when I had left it at 93.1.  The change was never by more than one click, AM or FM, and like I said it happened only a few times in the beginning and a few times very recently. I just re-adjust the frequency and it's fine. It never drifts once it has been reset.

The next one though does annoy me.  About one month after buying the Audi I had the opportunity to fold down the rear seats for extra storage room in the trunk. When I tried to return the right-rear seat to the upright position, I found that the middle lap belt, which runs from the top-back of the seat, not the back deck, down into the middle of the seat bench, had &quot;locked up&quot;. What I think happened is that the belt tensioner had tripped. I thought after reading the Audi owner's manual that all of the belt tensioners triggered only after a major accident when the airbags had deployed. Well, there was no accident and no airbag deployment but there was also no way to raise that back rear seat. The seat belt had pulled tight and held firmly. After talking with my local dealer service rep, I learned there was no secret button to release the seat belt and the only thing left to do was take the car in to replace the mechanism, or, until I could get the mechanism replaced, cut the middle seat belt webbing. And, that's what I did. So now, I have seat belts in the rear for only two people. I don't feel good about that. Hopefully, Audi is going to consider the belt tensioner defective and replace it under warranty. There's no way it should have locked up just when folding down the rear seat.

<b>I Still Love Her, Quirks and All</b>
Anyway, those are the only two things that aren't 100% perfect with my first 4 1/2 months with my new Audi A6 2.7T.  Given the many other pleasant driving experiences I've had, like driving in the mountains or through snow, I'd say my original high opinion of the 2000 Audi A6 2.7T hasn't changed at all.
