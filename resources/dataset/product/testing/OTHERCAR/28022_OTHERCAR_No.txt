            I recently owned a 1992 Grand am se and never had any problems with it until it reached the 140000 mile mark. As far as Im concerned the car did me good for all those miles. So, it was time to get a different one. I looked at the Oldsmobile Aleros, Monte Carlos and Grand prixs. I really liked the grand prix but they are a little too pricey for me, so I went with the Grand Am Se2, sport edition package. All I can say is JUNK!! I have spent over 1k on this car since I bought it a year ago. Within the first month I had it the wheel bearings had to be replaced. Then a new noise seemed to pop out, and I had to shell out 700.00 for a new steering gear. Then ANOTHER noise popped out, so I had them put a new strut on it, they seemed to think that was the problem, and the shock was bad, at 60000 miles, but that was not where the noise was. So, I still have the noise and no one seems to know where it is coming from. The car has a vibration in the steering wheel that Ive been trying to figure out since I bought it. Over a year and they still dont know what is causing the vibration. I bought new tires, new wheels, had balancing and rotation done,had it alligned and it still vibrates!
The car is nice to look at and I have done some custom work on it, but these cars are so badly made, you hear every little creak in the dash and every bump is like hitting a pothole the size of a city. So, I would rate this car as very unreliable, you get one problem fixed and another pops up, its been neverending for me. So needless to say, Im trading it off hopefully for a Grand prix gt.
