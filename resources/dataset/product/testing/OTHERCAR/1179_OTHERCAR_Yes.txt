               Well I had a 1998 Plymouth Neon and totaled it, so I needed to buy another car.  I started looking for used cars and a dealer recommended looking into a 2000 Dodge Neon because the financing was good and that it would not be much more expensive to buy a new car.  I test drove a 2000 Dodge Neon ES for a weekend and I fell in love with it.  I bought it on the following Tuesday, February 14, 2000.
    The one thing I really love about the new Neon is the gas mileage.  With the high gas prices, 40 miles to the gallon is a good thing, especially if you drive long distances like me, at least 50 to 100 miles a day.  The newer Neon (stick-shift) has better acceleration than the older models and a better body style.  The stereo system is much better too.  My one complaint is the headroom.  If you have a friend or if you are fairly tall (over 6 feet), you may feel a little squished with the way the top of the car curves.
    The newer Neon is a lot of fun to drive.  It corners well and has good acceleration, even with the air conditioner on.  I love to drive my new car!!!
    I feel that this is a great car for anyone, especially for younger people and college students because it's a great buy for a small amount of money and is fairly cheap on insurance.  It is not for the very tall or speed enthusiast.  <br><br>
