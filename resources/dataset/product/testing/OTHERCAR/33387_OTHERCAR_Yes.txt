            I bought this car after my 1991 Honda Accord was rear ended.  The dealer I bought it from brought in from a dealer in another part of the state so when I received it, it had 104 miles on it.  I couldn't drive a stick at the time, so my mom had to drive it home for me.  I spent the next 3 days learning the stick and have loved it ever since.  The model I bought was a GLS with the Luxury Package that included alloy wheels and a sunroof.

<b>Interior</b>
First thing you'll notice at night is the color of the controls and dials.  All the controls such as the radio buttons and window buttons on the doors are red and the dials on the dash and screen on the radio is almost a purplish blue.  Some people say they think it would be distracting, but I really like it.  Makes it unique from other cars.  Has a trip odometer, along with a tachometer.  The clock is also on the dash in front of the driver below the tachometer, which I think is characteristic of VW.

The seats are fairly stiff, but very comfortable for long drives or around town.  The cloth isn't like other material I've seen in cars before.  My one gripe about is that it grabs all the hairs and particles from people and with the black cloth it is very noticeable.  The floor is similar in that the black shows a lot.  It is very high quality material though.  The front seats have ample room, but the back seats are cramped for most people.  The floor mats purchased with the car snap to the floor but most people move them when they get in and the back mats end up jammed under the seat.  I noticed that newer Jettas have newer snaps so maybe they hold stronger.  The back seat is split 60/40 and can fold down in two ways.  Either the back comes down but is still elevated a bit, or the seats can fold up to where a person's legs would be behind the seats and the back seat can fold down flat extending the trunk greatly.

The trunk is very large with a compartment for a cd-changer on the left and a mesh basket to the right.  The floor lifts to reveal the full-size spare and jack.  The trunk's lift system is hydraulic I guess in that it is not counter-balanced to open when you "pop" it.  This allows for more space in the trunk whereas another car would have the beams poking into the trunk.  When you close it it sounds like it's closing too hard, but it really isn't.  The trunk, doors, and hood are very sturdy and shut with a definitive thud.

The dash and molding is like a soft plastic that is dull in color, not shiny like other dashes, which I like.  The same cloth on the seats is also on the doors.  A friend once remarked that the arm rest on the door was perfectly molded to an arm and makes for a very comfortable ride.  The window and lock controls for the driver are horizontal on the arm rest and very easy to use.  The two front windows have one-touch up and down settings.  The controls on the other doors are vertical on the door and most people have trouble figuring out which is the window and lock when they first get in.  Also on the drive door is the electronic switches for the gas-cover and trunk.  These can be locked by the master key so the valet key cannot open them.

The stereo is great, with 2 speakers in each door.  I purchased a cd-changer for the head unit later and have enjoyed it thoroughly.  It is in the trunk in a compartment in the side covered by a latched door which is really neat.  It has 2 FM bands for 12 preset stations, 1 AM band for 6 presets, a tape deck and also connections for a cd-changer which can be bought separately, which I did.  The stereo can get very loud but still sounds good with the high and low tones coming clearly without one drowning out the other.

The gear shift is conveniently placed.  The center armrest has 2 down settings.  One is parallel to the ground while the other declines more so it is perfect for shifting gears.  One thing I've noticed about the manual transmissions is that the length from gear to gear seems sort of "long" compared to other cars.  This is not bad but makes for a longer gear switch.

<b>Exterior</b>
I got the "Cool White" exterior color.  If you've seen one it's hard to describe it  because it's definitely a different "white" from other cars, but I don't know why.  It's definitely good looking.  The alloy wheels add a nice look to the car.  The car has daytime-running lights that I wish could be disabled, but that's is not a big deal.  The headlights are very bright and make for great night-driving.  Mine were aimed a little too high so everyone I passed thought I had my brights on, but I had the dealership fix that for me.  The rear of the car is interesting because the keyhole for the trunk is inside the VW emblem as opposed to having another hole in the metal.  The tires on the car when I bought it were horrible and I had to get new ones after about 18,000 miles.  I have since heard that VW has offered a recall for the tires and has changed the tires on the new cars.

<b>Engine</b>
I am very into engines and have been moreso since buying this car.  I don't know much about fixing or working on them but I do like reading about the specs and all.  The engine I bought with the car is the 2.0L Inline 4 cylinder.  It produces 115-hp and 122-lbs of torque.  In comparison to other cars this may sound low, but this car can fly especially with the manual transmission.  I've been in some arguments with people about the car needing 6-gears.  I think a 6th gear would be beneficial because when on the highway at 60 mph the engine is at around 3200 rpm if I can remember correctly, which is fairly high.  And on average driving around 70-80mph the rpms get to around 4000.  Aside from that the car is a blast to drive around town, especially windy, hilly roads.  Most people are surprised to hear it's only a 4 cylinder after reading with me because of the speed of it.  I put a trailer hitch on the car after buying it and it has no trouble pulling my boat which is around 6-700 lbs.  Around town I usually get around 24 mpg, and on the highway I get around 30-32.  The car brakes very well with ABS, and it can turn on a dime.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I have absolutely loved this car since buying it.  Unfortunately last year I had a pretty serious wreck in it.  I was going through an intersection and someone ran the light t-boning me and causing me to into the other lane and hit someone else.  All in all the cost to repair was over $10k.  Luckily covered by the other person's insurance.  Since then there have been some rattles inside that are fairly annoying, but I blame this on the wreck.  There are a few things I would change on the car, but not many.  This car is very fun to drive and very versatile, from taking trips, hauling a boat, or city-driving.  I would definitely recommend this car to someone else.  Since buying it VW has made improvements to the car.  The warranty I received was rather poor but has since been upped to 4 year/50,000 miles, which I think is fairly average.  The 1.8Turbo engine and the V6 have also received more power in the 2002 models which I cannot believe.  My car is quick as it is, but the other engines have at least 60 hp on it so I'm sure they are even more fun to drive.  I don't think this will be my last VW I own.
