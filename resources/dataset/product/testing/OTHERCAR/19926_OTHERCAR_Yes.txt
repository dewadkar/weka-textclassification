            I bought this car because ever since I was a child, I have liked and breathed Jaguar cars. They are all so lush and desirable, and the new S-Type is no exception. They are modelled by the finers designers who concentrate on looks and characterbility. The S-Type has both. 
At an average price of $42,000.00 it isn't the cheapest car on the road, but the sheer brilliance of this car will easily give you enough pleasure out of driving it. 
Every time I step into my Jag, I admire it completely as a whole. The whole car is amazing!
The colour of the my car is the best deep-green and with a coat of polish a couple of times a month, it gleams and shines as if it was still in the showromm window. The leather seats are as comfortable as anything. You can sit back and relax in them and almost fall asleep. (Not suggested though!)
I believe that the person who should buy this car should enjoy relaxing and have no pressure upon his shoulders whilst driving. Let the car do the work.
Happy Driving!<br><br>
