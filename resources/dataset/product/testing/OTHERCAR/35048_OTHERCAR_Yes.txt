            I purchased a 2000 Land Rover Discover series II in September, after being recommended to me by a friend. I needed a larger car for work. I am in sales and needed the cargo space for samples but did not want to give up the luxury I had come accustomed to in my mercedes. I drove the SUV and decided it was the one for me. I paid the additional $1,600 for the dual sunroofs...my dog loves the rear roof. 

About a month later I was driving on the highway and was going about 60mph when a work truck decided it wanted to be in my lane. This ran me off the road where my driver side rear quarter panel hit a large limestone rock embankment, I then spun around and the passenger side quarter panel hit the highway sign which designates the street exit, I spun again and landed in the ditch facing the opposite way. 

You may not have wanted the detailed description of my accident but I must say, I walked away from the accident with no broken bones. I do have neck sprain and I hit my knee while spinning but I am alive. Both paramedic drivers and the policemen were in awe of my unbelievable experience.

Perhaps the most impressive thing is that all 4 doors still opened and closed with the entire capsule still intact. The car was still running after hitting everything in sight, I had to turn it off when I got out of the vehicle. This is definitely the safest vehicle I could have been in. It is a tall vehicle but the important thing is the majority of the weight is in the lower half and this alone kept me from rolling over. I would have rolled in almost every other SUV.

Please, if you want to protect the things that are dear to you, this is the vehicle to feel safe in. The SUV was not totaled, they are replacing the 2 quarter panels and the roof they attach to...truly amazing!<br><br>
