                I purchased a 1994 Mitsubishi Eclipse in 1998 for $8,000.  The particular model I chose had no letter designation -in other words, no options, and it has the 1.8 L 4-cylinder- but I loved the way it looked and it only had 36k. It also turned out to be a 5-speed, which I believe is a necessity in any car.
    Despite the lack of horsepower (I believe it's about 100 or so) the car accelerates with some authority, though that is mostly due to the 5-speed. 
    After I figured out that it was not a race car, I was still very impressed with the engineering of the car.  I found it to be a very solid vehicle It does occasionally jump out of reverse when I back up.  This could have turned into a problem if it was any other gear, but I can hold it in reverse while backing up.
    The rest of the car is great, the paint is holding up after 6 winters, no rust at all.  The engine, while probably being excessively abused in order to keep up with traffic, shows no signs of distress.  The ride could be smoother, but I don't feel like putting money into struts right now.  The car handles as well as I would have hoped
    All in all, I got what I thought I was getting, and I still love the way the car looks.  As for driving it, I can deal with that.<br><br>
