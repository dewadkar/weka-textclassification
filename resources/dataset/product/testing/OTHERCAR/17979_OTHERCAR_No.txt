            This camera reminds me of a pack of prepackaged cookies that get stuck in the vending machine, in a world full of freshly baked apple pies straight out of the oven. 

To get to the topic, I've seen cameras that were a lot better for the price. My Casio QV 100 annoys me over and over and over again.

First of all, the most time I ever got out of my camera (ever) was about 20 minutes straight, and that was after I just put in brand new batteries. I was taking EBay pictures, and I only was able to get about 10 good ones. This camera bites up batteries like they're going out of fashion. When you take into account the price, you've gotta add up the battery money you're going to spend. If you're an avid picture taker, this could mean hundreds a month. I've tried using rechargeables, but those last 10 minutes, tops. It takes about that time just to recharge the darned things!

The pictures that the camera does take aren't that high quality. The small pictures are nice, I'll admit. But once you start to get a little bigger than wallet size, things start to look heinous, especially if you're taking pictures of people. I wanted to take a few nice pictures of friends and blow them up to standard computer paper size, but the quality was pretty bad. I was disappointed.

Next, lighting is a big problem. I'm aware that most digital cameras need a lot of light to take a good picture, but you've gotta be directly under the sun in order to get a good shot with this camera. I've had this camera for a year or so, and have never gotten a good indoor picture, and I have tried. I get DECENT ones if I go JUST under the lightbulb, and not a millimeter away.

There are a few perks, though. The software that this camera uses is a pretty easy install, and when you get it, you can save pictures in photo albums and then delete the pictures from your space. Usually I can only save up to 75(ish) pictures before my camera starts being annoying, so it's good to be able to delete some and get them away, especially if they're only for Ebay or something. You can also take pictures from the camera and convert them into .bmps, .jpgs, or .gifs. You can save them like that and then delete them from your camera. Since a lot of people can't read .cam files, that's pretty helpful - believe it or not, I know people whose camera software doesn't allow them to convert.

All in all, this camera proves to be mostly novelty for me. I take a regular camera for reliability when I go out, and if I knew how this camera was going to work, I wouldn't have spent more than about $125 for it. There are tons of new cameras out there now, that for a little more money, you can get much more. Memory and battery power are two of the most important things to look for when purchasing a camera, and the Casio QV 100 just doesn't have those. <br><br>
