            Two words: Luxury &amp; Fun!!! 
Like many others I wanted to try the SUV experience and spent quite a bit of time researching and test driving the many options out there. What I was looking for was:
~ a good looking vehicle
~ ROOM inside (leg room, head room, and storage room)
  I was amazed how small many SUVs were inside (some quite deceiving)
~ a good company history
~ options (I like toys and comfort: Leather Seats, Power everything, Sun 
  Roof, Decent Stereo system with CD {Graphic Equalizer was a nice bonus])
~ POWER and good handling
~ low risk (tipping, high clearance, accident survival)
~ 4-Wheel drive options
I actually had originally thought against a Grand Cheroke (&quot;everyone has one as a Status Symbol) but it had everything I was looking for. The ORVIS was a Limited Edition in '96 which is one of the nicer editions they've ever produced.
It's the best of both worlds - the fun and practicality of a SUV with the comfort of a Cadillac.
