            The Dodge Intrepid is an amazing value. It's not as expensive as the Camry, but provides a more comfortable ride. It's only downfall, is that it isn't as well engineered as most other cars. I've had quite a few trips to the shop in the past two years, and the car isn't even 4 years old yet! First, the brakes went out, then it was shortly followed by the alternator. That was a hefty dip into my pocket. But the interior is very roomy and more than comfortable. It's big enough to fit six adults, with breathing room! The back is a little small, but if you scoot the front ones up, you have an amazing amount of room. The car has an AWESOME pickup. It has more get up and go than my V-8 F-150. Sad to say though, it's not really worth the investment. I would strongly suggest spending the extra cash, and going with a Toyota Camry or even and a Honda Accord for that matter. <br><br>
