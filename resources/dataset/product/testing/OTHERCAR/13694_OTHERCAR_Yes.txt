            This car is a very smooth and fun ride!  My family invested in the Mazda 626 less then a year ago and it's only getting better.  We love it.  Everything from the look of the car, to the trunk, right down to the steering wheel.  Yes, even the steering wheel grabs my attention, no pun intended. 

I am sure that after my experience with the 626 I will own quite a few Mazdas, and I will possibly stick with the 626.  Really this car rides smoother then most others.  It has a very tight grip to the road, it has a nice pick up, and stops on a dime.  And the gas mileage that this car can get is very useful considering the high rise in gas prices.  It is also a great family car.  It can easily hold 5 people comfortable.  

So if you take care of this car there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to join the 300,000 mile club and still look like you are driving a brand new car.      <br><br>
