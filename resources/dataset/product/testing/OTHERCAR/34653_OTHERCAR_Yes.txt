            Our new Pontiac Montana is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned! It drives like a dream. We love the ease of handling and the 6 cylinder engine has got a lot of &quot;uumph&quot;. The interior is beautiful, the layout of the interior is very &quot;user friendly&quot;. I honestly can not find anything the I hate about this vehicle. The color is a beautiful bright red. The seating configuration is very functional and easy to adjust if needed. There are many options that can be ordered with this vehicle, even a VCR and TV. This option would prove very helpful on a long trip especially if you have children. The ride is very quiet. The seats are very comfortable. Right now is the time to buy because of the current incentives offered by Pontiac on the Montana. You owe it to yourself to check this van out! I can not recommend it highly enough. Another feature I like is the instrument panel design. The stereo system is premier. The new stereo is unbelievable. It can search out specific music types and even tells you what station you are listening to. The dual sliding side doors make getting in and out for passengers a breeze. There is plenty of storage space. There is even a filter for the air conditioning using a HEPA filter that is great benefit for people who suffer from allergies. It also has dual front airbags and side airbags for optimal safety.<br><br>
