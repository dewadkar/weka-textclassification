            Greetings all!!!

Hey everybody I got the chance the other day to use a superb Digital Camera.

The Sony MVC-FD91 is one fine piece of electronic equipment.  Several of the guys that work in our test lab think this is the top of the line for DCs.

I purchased this camera for several reasons.  The first was ease of use and because it uses a 3.5 inch floppy disk.  Each disk can hold up to 10 photos on fine mode, and up to one minute of video and sound.  In the standard mode it will hold up to 20 photos.  The second reason I picked this camera was because of it's great ability to use in the lab.  We are always trying to perfect different testing methods, and without going into great detail, I can tell you we are really having great results.

The cost for the camera is a bit high, but it is certainly worth the sacrifice.

I also need you to know that the camera is not really set up for the amateur once in awhile photographer.  If you are going to buy this camera you will need to use it quite often, to get your monies worth.

The biggest drawback we found was that it was large and in a word clunkey.
