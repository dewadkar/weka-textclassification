                  <b>The Montero</b> made its grand debut in 1988 as Mitsubishi's large sport utility, which was tough, unsophisticated, and an ideal off-roader. For 1997 Mitsubishi came out with a new model, the 'Montero sport.' This new version of the Montero is shorter, and lower than the full-sized model.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   <b>W</b>hen I think of a 'Sport' modeled vehicle, I always feel that there should be something sporty under the hood. Like a person who is sporty, he or she has a healthy body, heart etc, or someone who works out, has big muscles. I have always believed 'sport' modeled cars, trucks, or SUVs should also have the internals synonymous with a person who is physically active. With the 'Montero Sport' there really isn't too much 'sport' under the hood. There is a 134 horsepower 2.4 liter 4-cylinder deigned to move 4,000 lbs as the base engine, and a DOHC 3.0 V6 that has just an adequate 173 horsepower. The 1997 Montero sport feels solid and put together well, but with the 3.0 engine moving 4,000 lbs means <b>acceleration</b> is only adequate. Less than sporty power combined with high mileage on my test Montero Sport made for a 0-60 time, I'm guessing in the 12 second range. Even though it takes approx. 12 seconds to get this vehicle to 60 MPH, the Montero Sport does fine on the road. 
Hills are not a problem once the automatic transmission down-shifts, also passing other cars is accomplished quite easily. The ride is somewhat soft, and hushed with a well insulated interior. 
<b>Handling</b> is fair, with only moderate understeer. Corners are tackled with much more ease than some sport utility vehicles on the market. Off-road, this SUV feels more at home; with the low ratio engaged in four-wheel drive, combined with the optional limited slip differential, traction is impressive. 4-wheel drive can be engaged at speed.  
<b>Note:</b> The '97 Montero Sport comes in 2 wheel drive, and 4 wheel drive. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual, and a 4-speed automatic. Expect around 21 MPG with the 5-speed manual and 19 MPG with the automatic. 

  <b>A little info about this engine:</b> My test SUV came with the 3.0 Engine. This engine is Mitsubishis's iron block and alloy headed V6. This engine is a Short stroke design, with a single overhead camshaft per bank of cylinders, but it still uses four valves per cylinder. The valves are opened via hydraulic valve lifters, which are used to promote low maintenance and quiet running. The four-valve per cylinder nature shows in the engine speed at which maximum torque is produced. It comes in fairly high 188 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm, in contrast to the traditional off-road requirement that engines produce low lugging power.

  <b>Designed to be tough</b>, the Montero Sport has a rigid, separate chassis instead of unitary construction. It has a leaf-sprung rear axle, along with torsion-bar and wishbone front suspension.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

 The <b>interior,</b> while not Cadillac Escalade material, is quite luxurious. Very supportive cloth seats were fitted, a thick leather steering wheel, and a very easy to use automatic shifter. The Montero Sport's instruments are models of clarity, and equipment is generous. A tachometer and cold Ac are standard. There is plenty of watts powering the 6 speaker sound system. Ergonomics are near perfect, all the switches are almost right in front of the driver. Power everything was added as a premium package. Although there is less room than the regular Montero, there is plenty of room for every passenger, and the driver.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

  The Montero Sport, like the commercials imply, is quite sexy. I'm not too fond of the rear reflector bar, but from most angles this is one sexy machine. Even though the engine may not possess 'sport', the exterior definitely does. Steel wheel are standard, but the with the premium package you get alloys. While the Montero Sport sits lower than the regular Montero, it still rides relatively high, and you will find yourself on the freeway sitting higher than most vehicles on the road. Also discreet but clear badging distinguishes the sport model. <b>QUESTION:</b> The V6 models have a 'V6' badge on the front grille. Is it really necessary for us to know this vehicle has a V6? Is a V6 so special in a 4,000lb vehicle that it deserves to get posted on the vehicle itself?  

  <b>Price and Reliability:</b> New, the 4-wheel drive 3.0 XL's ran for nearly $28,000, today it can be had for around $16,000, the lesser Models can be had for even less. Reliability on my Test SUV (which is owned by my boss) has been very reliable for him. He has put over 100,000 miles on it, and it still ran pretty strong, It started right up, and didn't smoke or get hot while idling in heavy traffic.
