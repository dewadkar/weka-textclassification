            I bought this vehicle based on the number of years in the market.  A Jeep SUV has been around longer than its' competitor with more history to research.  I love the feel of riding/driving high.  Feels like I am the 'queen' of the road!  I hate the fact that I did not get a 4-wheel drive.  The 2-wheel drive drives sort of rough and it takes a while to get use to the feel especially if you are coming straight from a car like I did to a SUV.  First time drivers should not let this be their 1st vehicle purchase.  And if you are afraid of the road then this is definitely not the vehicle for you.  Confidence handles this ride like a baby!  My next purchase will definitely be ANOTHER Jeep Grand Cherokee!!  Experience IT!<br><br>
