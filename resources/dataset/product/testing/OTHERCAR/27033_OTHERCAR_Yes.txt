            We were recently in the market for a new digital camera since our early model had no flash. We shopped the reviews online and proceeded to the store with our list of maybes.  After comparing them instore, we settled on the Olympus D-450 zoom.

 So far we are very pleased- even the first run of pictures were good and that alone says something to me- anytime you have new equipment it takes a little getting used to. But this camera lived up to most all of the claims we had read/heard about. Crisp photos with little fuss and ease of use. 

 The down side was the claims of 1000 photos on 4 batteries- we did not get anywhere near that but have to admit the batteries did last longer than in our previous model- we were also using the flash which may have contributed to the increased battery usage. 

 The photos printed even on plain paper have a good appearance. I would definitely recommend the accessory Olympus MAUSB-1 Smartmedia reader writer- your pictures will be transferred to your computer with incredible speed and ease!! A definite improvement over the direct transfer from camera.

 The D-450 zoom takes quality photos inside and out and will see much use from our family. Another plus is the size- it is no larger than our 35mm camera and very easy to take along anywhere. 

 A primary feature for us is the optical zoom lens- a must for anyone who does close ups!! Overall, we feel this camera is great return for your money.<br><br>
