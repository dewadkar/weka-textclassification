            The Toyota Celica 2002 GT-S is a great all around sporty coupe with nice upgrades as an option. My white Celica came with the Action Pakage which comes with a rear spoiler and a body kit called "rocker panels". The rear spoiler is adjustable and you have a choice of 16 or 17 inch alloy wheels. Mine came with different tires and  chrome rims that the dealer had switched with the other ones. That added about 4,000 to the price, I suppose. 
It had 180 horsepower. Some of the features that came standard were power lock doors, and power windows, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, and a cd/am/fm stereo with 2 extra speakers than what the GT had to offer. 
Inside its a little cramped but not a big problem for me since I am petite but this is not the most comfortable ride for tall folk.
When I took it for a test drive, it handled smoothly and the engine was loud. It also received favorable attention from the people we passed by. A unique feature that the steering wheel has is buttons that lets you shift gears  and it shows you what gear you are in. I was driving an automatic but I swiched to manual by pressing those buttons. That is called the sportshift. It also had "weight sensors" on the seats that allow you to know if your passenger has its seatbelt on or not. A small icon stays on until your passenger buckles up. 
The stereo was not as clear as it could sound and for the price I paid it did not even have a power antenna! Or Leather Seats! But those jackals convinced me to get it (I paid way too much for it) and I do not regret it.
The 2002 Toyota Celica will be remodeled in 2004. Sales dropped last year and they are trying to do the best they can to sell, sell, sell. Maybe if they add a turbo like the Toyota Supra...we will see.
