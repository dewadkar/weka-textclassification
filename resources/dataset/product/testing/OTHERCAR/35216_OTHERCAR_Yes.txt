            A little over 1 year ago we bought a 1999 Toyota 4-Runner.  Let's say I'd like to drive it more than any other vehicle I have owned.

Reason 1:  Toyota has always been a sign of quality.  This 4-runner has all the great things I love in a car.  It is quiet, comfortable, and has enough space for the kids, the dog, and all the camping gear.

Reason 2:  Toyota has a value that lasts.  You drive the new car off the lot and the value has already diminished.  With a Toyota you can be assured that the value of the car will outlast the value of any other vehicle in it's class.

Reason 3:  The best experience I have ever had with purchasing a new car was at Toyota.  They took care of us and we got a tremendous deal on our truck.

Reason 4:  Versatility.  You can go anywhere and feel confident that the vehicle will perform.  The 4-wheel drive options take you off-road, the height of the vehicle helps you navigate through traffic on the busy highway, and the turning radius is better than that of many cars I have owned not to mentions other trucks I have driven.

Over all this is the best car I have ever owned and is well worth what we paid for it.<br><br>
