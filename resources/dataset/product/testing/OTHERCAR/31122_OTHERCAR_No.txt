            I leased this vehicle because I thought that the price for the lease was reasonable.  Although I am relatively satisfied with the vehicle, it is in no way a luxury vehicle.  The vehicle lags going up hills, and the gas mileage is mediocre.  I have only had the vehicle for 7 months and it was broken into 2 months after I acquired it.  My insurance on this vehicle is outrageous, supposedly because Acuras have such a high rate of theft and parts are very expensive.  The car does have a few nice features.  The sunroof and cruise control are standard.  I purchased one with leather seats which are very nice.  Although I feel that the car is adequate, the worst part of my Acura experience was the service I received.  Acura apparently does not care at all about its customers.  They made mistakes on my lease three times and kept harassing me to resign.  Not one person called to see if I liked my vehicle or if I was happy with my purchase.  My salesman was rude immediately after I signed the papers.  Unfortunately this is a three year lease.  Acura claims they are a luxury car and treat their customers the same, but I felt more like I was buying a Hyundai.  I have no desire to ever do business with Acura again.  I have leased from other places and been treated like a queen.  This is a company that needs to work on their product  and customer service skills.  I dread going back to the dealership if any problems occur with the car.<br><br>
