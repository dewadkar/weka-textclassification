               A Honda Civic! Does that usually come to mind as a great car?  It may not now, but it will soon.  For the last 10 years Honda Civics have becoming more popular.  This will not change anytime soon.  
The Civic is a very nice looking car.  Granted its not a corvette, but it is a car that people look at and say &quot;Hey thats a nice car!&quot;  This is an affordable but very reliable car.  Honda makes cars that seem to last for ever.  
If kept tuned up Civics will easily reach 150,000 miles.  More likely 200,000. 
 This car appeals to many groups of people.  The 4-door Civic is a good family car because it is roomy for a compact car, affordable and safe.  The best use of this car would be for a college student.  This car is great for just getting around and taking friends places.  Price obviously is important for a college student. 
 The civic is extremely affordable for the performance it offers. Proven by its performance, i would recommend this car for the price but quality conscious consumer. <br><br>
