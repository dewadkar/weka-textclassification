            Although the Isuzu Trooper has taken some flack for tending to roll over, my experience has been that it is as stable as any SUV can be expected to be. I bought my Trooper (V6 SOHC) in 1993 and to date it has only 71,000 on the clock. The engine has always leaked a few drops of oil per day, and it appears that this is due to a known fault that the engines suffers from, which is something associated with the head of the engine. When it was under warranty the dealer tried to fix this leakage on two occasions, even fitting some extra part because the factory was aware of the shortcoming. But nothing stopped the leak or the subsequent fouling of the plugs. Then at 71,000 miles, the automatic transmission needed completely rebuilding. It was then that I learned two things: a) the transmission had failed as a result of power fluctuations from the engine caused by the design fault that caused oil leakage and plug fouling, and b) I met other people who had similar engine/transmission problems. (One person had a new transmission at 50,000 and again at 90,000 miles!).
Apparently, the engine used prior to 1993 was often good for 200,000 miles, but it seems that after this time the engine and transmission were much less reliable.
This will very definitely be my last Isuzu.
