            I was recently in the market for a hatchback car, and researched the VW Golf and the Civic HB.  I finally decided on the VW, which i am quite happy about.  It's a cute car, but that isn't all there is to it.  

I chose a manual transmission which shifts smoothly and nicely.  Pickup isn't as good as the Mazda 626 (1996) that i had been driving before, especially with the AC on, but it is definitely still adequate.  

Trunk space is surprising for the size of the car--however, it was hard to get a large bookcase into the car because the front seat does not fold down all the way.  

The size is great, especially for parallel parking!  And i love how easy the hatchback makes backing up--no guessing where the end of the car is, because you can see it!  

I haven't had the car long enough to comment on the overall dependability of it, though i do have plenty of friends who have VWs and all recommend getting them and claim that they will never buy another make of car.  

The air conditioner is the best i've ever had in a car--its cold within a minute of starting the car, and gets the car cool quick.  Very nice when living in a hot humid climate like i do!  

I definitely recommend this car as a great one to buy!<br><br>
