            We bought a 1994 intrepid from a used car dealer a few months ago,and it had 100 thousand miles on it.We were a little leary of it with so many mile on it but it was what we wanted and in are price range.We have had it for nine months and only had one problem with it,and it was just the battery,which is minor.We have to kids both in car seats and they fit comfortably in the back,with room to spare.It has the custom rims and a infinity stereo system,all the options,air,power every thing,totally loaded.this is a perfect car in every way ,as soon as we get are tax money back were going to buy me one of my own maybe a newer model though.So all in all a good used car choice ,a good new car choice,you can't lose!!!!!!!<br><br>
