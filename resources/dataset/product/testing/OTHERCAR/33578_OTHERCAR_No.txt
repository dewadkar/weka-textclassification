            The 528 is a beautiful car, but mine was a lemon.  It drives extremely well, is very comfortable and is solid.  But...it was in the shop 20 times in 2 years for a host of mostly minor but extraordinarily irritating problems.  What was most galling was the attitude of the dealer.  They treated me as if I were privileged to have such a car and that I should enjoy coming to the dealership, which required a 2 hour detour from my normal route.  And what I cannot understand is why the manufacturer would not apologize profusely to me and try to make me happy instead of having a &quot;consultant&quot; call me in response to my letters and try to placate me with a few free accessories.  If I were them, I would have said to me--&quot;We are extremely sorry.  Please let us buy the car back from you and replace it with a non-lemon.  We want your complete satisfaction.&quot;  Instead, they have made a non-friend for life.  And what is worse--I tell all my friends the same story...

Like another reviewer, I compare this experience with that of owning a 1993 Camry.  It was in the shop once in 5 years, for a seat belt jam.  I was treated like a king.  Now a Camry is obviously not a BMW, but the overall experience of ownership was 10 times better.  

Another minor oddity:  The 5-speed transmission has a strangely long &quot;throw&quot; in the shifter and in the clutch.  As a result, shifting can be less quick and precise than I would like. 


A safety note:  While the BMW is overall a very safe car, the sight lines are poor in some areas.  The headrests in the back seat impede the vision backing up, and the pillars in front and back can block your vision merging sometimes.  This has actually proven dangerous to me a couple of times.  It can be overcome through caution, but still it seems strange to me.<br><br>
