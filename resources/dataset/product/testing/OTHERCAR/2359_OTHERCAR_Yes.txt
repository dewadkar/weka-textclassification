            I took my camera on a ten day cruise to Mexico aboard the ms Statendam recently. And it is the way to go.
This camera is great for a number of reasons.
1. It is small. You can slip it into a shirt pocket, or buy a case to hang it around your neck. So much better than using a camera like the Sony with a disk.
2. It gives you the choice of three output devices and all are included.
    a. Serial cable
    b. USB cable
    c. Cable to TV set.
3. Choice of compression
   The standard 8 mb card allows you to choose compression size. You can    take as many as 124 shots with a 1/16 compression and a file size of    60kb to 8 shots with a file size of 960 kb.
   I used the normal selection of 66 shots 1/8 compression.
There doesn't seem to be much loss in quality no matter what ratio you use.
You can see the results of some 50 shots taken on the cruise on my web page below.
