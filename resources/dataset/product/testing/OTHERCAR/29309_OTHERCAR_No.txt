            Can you say unoriginal?  Everybody who wants to be cool like the everyone else should buy this car.  Oh, and get an automatic too. Then everyone will know for sure that your car is NOT a sports car.  An automatic Camaro is as cool as a minivan.  If want a sports car, first, make sure you get a stick shift.  I rarely see a stick shift camaro.  This is likely because Chevrolet realizes that most americans are too stupid to drive stick shifts, and for the most part they're right.  I, nor any other drivers of real sports cars, have any respect for all the people that drive bone stock, automatic camaro's with a subwoofer and tinted windows who do a neutral drop at every stoplight to show that they are insecure with their manhood and impress their shallow girlfriends.  Well, we're not impressed.  And for the record, you don't look good &quot;pimping&quot; in this car, although i do thank you for making my day more enjoyable since i get a good laugh every time i see one of you. And I do apologize to those that this does not apply to.  If you want to find me and beat me up now then this applies to you.    
About the car itself: it is a Chevy, good quality for about 70k miles. after which time it will probably fall apart.  Why does they camaro need an engine 2.5 times the size of mine to produce the same horsepower?  Can you say poor design??  and as for handling--can you say lean and dive?
While you're at it why don't you go buy some abercrombie and fitch or tommy hillfiger clothes, then you'd be reallllly cool!
