            We had been wanting to buy a new minivan for some time, but we didn't like how expensive new minivans had gotten.

We lucked out.  We just bought a well-equipped, new 2002 Quest in June 2003.  It drives well, it's quiet, it's very comfortable, and it has a video entertainment system with headphones that keeps my 4 year old boy very entertained and content.  

Although it is one of the smaller vans on the market, we were pleasantly surprised at how well it carries 6 people and a week's worth of luggage. 

It has plenty of power around town, although the 170 hp V-6 is a bit weak passing at 55 MPH or so.  We love the memory seats and the computerized fuel system display (MPG, miles to empty, etc).   

With the 2-tone paint and the sport wheels, the van looks sharp.  We're really pleased overall with the 2002 Quest. We can't believe that someone didn't snatch this baby up before we bought it.
