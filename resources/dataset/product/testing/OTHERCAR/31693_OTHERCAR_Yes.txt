            I bought this car because of a few reasons.  First of all, I was looking for a car that the would not have a huge insurance bill, but still be sporty looking and still have room in the back.  The Pontiac Grand Prix is sporty looking, very powerful, has room in the back and it is reasonably priced ($20,000-$25,000).  

I would highly recommend this vehicle because to anyone who wants any of these mentioned things.  The number one reason I bought this car was because of the insurance.  I am only 19 years old and as you all probably know that people under 25 have extremely high insurance payments.  This car is classified as a midsize car.  Thought the 2 door coupe looks and drives like any other similarly priced sports car if not better.  

I love this car because of it's sporty looks, but I still have room for all my friends because this car is very roomy, even in the back.  I can comfortably fit four people in this car though there is seating for five.  

I think that any one can drive this car.  I know a few people who own these cars and they are all extremely happy with them.  As many of you probably know, it is now the beginning of June.  That means that dealers are now going to be trying to get rid of the 2000 models in order to make room for the 2001 models.  This means that now is the time to go and by yourself one of these cars.<br><br>
