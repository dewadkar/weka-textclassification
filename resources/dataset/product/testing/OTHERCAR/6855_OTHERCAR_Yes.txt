            The Hyundai Elantra Wagon (Hyundai Lantra Sportswagon in Australia) is an affordable, economical family vehicle.

My husband and I liked the 1998 model so much that we purchased the 1999 model.  The vehicle is crammed with extras that you just don't expect for the low price that you pay.

I have found the Elantra Wagon to be excellent for driving around town.  I do a lot of mileage (38,000+ klms per year) and find this vehicle to be very affordable to run.   My husband and I Drove from Brisbane to Cairns (return) which is almost 4000 klms on open roads.  We found that the Elantra Wagon had plenty of power for passing Trucks and slow vehicles, even up hill.  The power/economy switch is very useful for that quick power burst to pass a slow moving vehicle up a steep hill.

I find the automatic gear changing smooth, unless driving through mountainous areas,  while going up a steep mountain range it is best to manually put the Elantra Wagon into 2nd or low gear.  The automatic transmission tends to keep changing out of low gear if your pressure on the accelerator is uneven.

The seats are very comfortable, with an easy to clean upholstery.  I find the interior of the Elantra Wagon quite spacious for a smaller vehicle.  the general appearance of the Elantra Wagon is quite sporty, with the roof racks (standard) just setting it off nicely.  The power steering make parking a breeze.  And the rear hatch is convenient for shopping.  There is plenty of space in the Elantra Wagon to fit your camping gear for the weekend, or to stock up on your grocery shopping.

The air-conditioning can be a little too cold.  The windscreen tends to fog up easily, thus creating a need for the air-conditioning to be on to de-mist the windscreen. The Elantra Wagon tends to be a little lower to the ground than some larger cars.  I have found that going in or our of inclining driveways on a slight angle (one front wheel slightly in front of the other) prevents scraping the fender.

The only real drawback I have found is that, because of the aerodynamic shape of the Elantra Wagon, the front passenger side has a rather large blind spot, especially when carrying a passenger in the front seat.  I have found that asking my husband to move his large cranium out of my view, tends to upset him.

I believe that the Elantra Wagon is an excellent vehicle for just about anyone.  The sporty appearance makes the Elantra Wagon an attractive vehicle for young people.  The fuel economy, spacious interior and affordable price, make the Elantra Wagon and excellent family vehicle.   With the sporty look and the space for merchandise, the Elantra Wagon is the perfect vehicle for a travelling (or door to door) sales person.<br><br>
