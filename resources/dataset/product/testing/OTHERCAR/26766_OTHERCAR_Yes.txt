            I must say, I am VERY pleased with this camera.  It has every feature you could want, and then some.

I must admit when I got the camera I was a little daunted by the menus and seemingly endless options available.  After quickly glancing through the manual, I had a good feel for the camera... it was incredibly easy to learn.

Before I get into details, let me list the reasons I bought this camera..

1.  I had a digital camera about 2 years ago which recently broke.  It was good when I was in high school but as I got older I got kind of tired with the limits of it(keep in mind this camera was probably the first digicam that was under 200 dollars.  This was way before the megapixel evolution).

2. This camera has a flash(old one did not)

3. This camera uses SmartMedia as opposed to internal memory(I learned this was an essential feature the hard way because when the old digicam died, it took the pictures I never got around to uploading with it :-/)

4. This camera fit my budget.  Believe it or not I only paid 99 dollars for this camera brand new at Officemax.(less than the first one!)

I won't bore you by listing every last feature, as many of the other reviews have done that.

All I want to say is that for the price this camera is now, theres no reason to settle for a .3megapixel(640x480) cam anymore.

With the included 8mb of memory, you can store 36 pictures in the "high quality" mode, which is 1280x960(you can go two steps higher in quality, and 2 steps lower). Even the lowest setting is still 640x480, great for images for the internet, auctions, etc. and with the 8mb you can store up to 122 of these shots.

Like I said another plus is smartmedia memory, which can be purchased very cheaply on ebay.  A 64mb card will let you save up to 976 images!(292 in high quality mode).

Overall.. this is by FAR the cheapest megapixel camera I've found out there and WELL worth the money.  You will not be dissapointed.
