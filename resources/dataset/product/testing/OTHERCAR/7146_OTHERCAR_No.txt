            Yes, most pickups are not great on ice.  And yes, for those of you who are wondering, I do have weight in the back, about 180 pounds.

The problem is ice and snow.  As this pickup of mine drives down the roads, you can often notice the back end &quot;breaking lose&quot;.  

But back to the beginning.  The pickup was bought to be my college vehicle.  The exterior, is the only part of it which I would rate very highly.  It is truly a very cute, even sporty pickup.  

At first, I thought having very limited space on the inside of the vehicle wouldn't effect me.  It didn't bother me at first, and slowly, I began to accumulate more and more stuff. 
That stuff took up more and more space, and I started to realize that I desperately missed the room.  

The first 30,000 miles were fine.  Then suddenly, one day, on my way back to college, my first transmission blew.  Luckily, I was able to drive the vehicle the rest of the way, and my local Chevy dealership installed a new transmission, which worked for approximately 150 miles of city driving, before that little red &quot;Service Engine Soon&quot; light
came on again.  Now, I was wary of transmission problems, since the earlier dealership had mentioned something about a bad torque converter (I know nothing about cars-- but he said it was from the factory), and that my transmission fluid had been mud basically.  I asked that the fluid be checked, the fluid was gone.  The break had malfunctioned and
somehow that had blown a hole through the transmission, anyway, that meant another
transmission.  Anyway, to conclude this long version of events, the transmission blew 6 times total, within a 1000 mile stretch, and each time, a mechanic told me it was something to do with a factory part, or a factory setting.  Driver error might be argued.  Maybe (all it's been used for is highway driving), but SIX times, come on.

That is not the only problem.  Within 2 days of exiting warranty coverage two incredibly huge cracks developed on the windshield.  No rock chips.  I asked, and was told it may have been put in incorrectly.  Nothing could be done at that point, because the warranty
was expired.  

The biggest problem I have encountered is the problems it has on ice.  The vehicle has been in the ditch 8 times in 6 months.  3 by me.  Then I learned to drive it about 50 mph tops any time the road looks remotely wet.  Driver error?  Yeah, might have a lot to do with it.  But is it everything?

Anyway, I like the vehicle, ONLY for driving around a city.  I wouldn't recommend the vehicle to anyone who drives for any distance outside of city limits.

In conclusion, I will be buying a car as soon as I can.<br><br>
