            For my first car this car is the best. My father bought this car for me and I was so happy. This vehicle has a very impressive miles per gallon ratio. This car is also at a very good price for what you buy.

The Acura GS goes for about 21,000 after everything is done and said. It has a horsepower of 140 and can fly on a straight a way. This car also has an rpm of 6300.  It has a gas engine, 4 cylinder, 1.8 liter engine.

The Acura can seat 4 people with 2 in the front and 2 in the back. The back is a little small but you can sit their for a short ride. The weight of the Acura is 2,639 pounds and its overall length is 172 inches.

The Acura gets 25 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon for the highway. 

My dad bought this car because it was not that expensive and its worth what we payed for it. 

I love the speed, the look of the car, and the low price. The only thing What I hate is their is not enough room in the back.

When I drive the Acura it is a smooth ride and can accelerate very fast.

This vehicle is for all ages and is fun to drive.

I love this car and I'm sure you would too.<br><br>
