                 I inherited my Malibu from my father about two months ago.  He had bought it new in '97.  All I can say is that I love this car.  It is a standard Malibu, but with the V6 engine from the ls.  This engine gives great acceleration for a car in it's class, and is unbelievably reliable.  Neither my father nor I have ever needed any repairs other than scheduled tune ups, and very little maintenance is needed.  You never need to change the transmission fluid, it gets great mileage, and changing the oil is a snap.  The engine is practically noiseless at any reasonable speed.  In fact, the first time I turned the key I didn't think it was starting, when in fact I just couldn't hear the engine.  
     The interior is very spacious.  My family and I (five people total) have driven from St. Louis to Chicago several times in this car, and it was always a very comfortable drive, even after four hours in close proximity to my sisters.  The ride quality is outstanding, especially on the highway.  Also, for a car in this class it accelerates very powerfully, both from a stop light and from a behind an '77 pickup truck with plastic bags for windows going 50 miles an hour in a 70 mph zone.  You really don't feel like you're in a family car.  
     Overall, wether you're a college student or a parent, this is the car for you.<br><br>
