            Jeep Wranglers are an EXCELLANT vehicle!!  I bought my 1985 Wrangler back in 1995, and I feel that this was a great investment.  I bought it because it has great gas mileage, a sharp looking design, and the make of the vehicle alone says alot.  

This is the perfect car for offroading, it can get you in and out of the tightest spots, in any type of condition.  I have taken my wrangler in the highest of mountains, in the snow, and did I say in the mud!!  : ) 

The prices of these new run about 20,000 depending on what type of extras you have, but what an excellant prices for an excellant vehicle!! Not only are they are great smooth ride, they handle well, have great gas mileage, nice price but they come in hard or soft top.  For cold weather just keep your hard top on, but in the great summer weather it is really easy to just pop the top off and store it away for the summer!!

You can add on many things to a jeep wrangler. Bigger tires, lift kits to give you the all the extra height you would want, winches.  About anything you can imagine you could add on.  These might look like a small vehicle, but you can not imagine what all you could get into one of these car!!  I have gone camping several times in mine, with 3 people in the car and had room both in and out of the car to store everything we needed and more!!

Great car to own, and you will get alot of attention driving one of these around!!<br><br>
