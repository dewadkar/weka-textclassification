              I had wanted a Honda Accord for years simply because they look so classy and sporty at the same time. Needless to say, I had to wait until  I had been out of college awhile and could afford one. I was 30 when I finally had my dream car. A white Honda Accord 4-door sedan with gold accents.
  Never before have I owned such a reliable, well made vehicle;(and let me tell you I've owned a few cars in my time!) Some of the benefits that stand out to me include; great gas mileage, dependable engine/parts and excellent craftsmanship. If you simply take care of your Honda you will easily get 200,000 miles out of these cars.
  The only thing that is even close to a downside is the price. They are somewhat expensive for the mid to upper class models, but well worth the cost in exchange for dependability/durability.<br><br>
