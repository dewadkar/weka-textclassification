            i had been eyeing the new 3 series when it came out in late 1998, and I finally was able to purchase one in april of this year. i purchased a used 99 and a half 328i with every single option except the navigation system and I truly love the car. ( Silver Ext/Black Interior)I would advise getting both the sport and premium packages, as well as the leather interior. ( Regarding leather, do not get black leather if you live in an area with lots of sun. i havent had much problems in nyc, but i drove down to DC a few times in the summer when it was really hot and humid, and i think you could have cooked eggs on the seats ). i dont think it makes much sense to get a beemer w/o the sports package, get a benz instead if you are worried about the ride. The 17&quot; rims that come with the sopts package are beautiful and really make the car look muscular, but they are definately a hassel to keep clean because of the brake dust. The car handles like butter with the sports package, it is truly a huge step up from my previous car, a 95 honda accord. All of the other options are cool gadgets, but not really necessary. My favorite one is a bunch of radar sensors that are mounted on the rear bumper which start beeping if you get to close to anything backing up. as far as problems go, ive had one problem with a faulty battery, but thats been it. you should keep in mind that car comes with a 3 year / 36,000 mile full maintance warranty, which i think is a big plus. ( an oil change is a about $80-90). the car is a bit small on the inside, so if you have a constant need to have more than 4 people in the car, dont buy it. The car seats four comfortably. I would recommend this car to someone in their 20's-30's who wants the closest thing to a race car with 4 doors. <br><br>
