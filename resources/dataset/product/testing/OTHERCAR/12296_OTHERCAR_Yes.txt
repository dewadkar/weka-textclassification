               I'm a 16 year old male and I have a 2000 Eclipse as my first car. I received the car as a Christmas present and I love it. The car draws attention and girls are always impressed when I mention that I own a 2000 Eclipse. I own the RS model and there are some downfalls. The four cylinder engine doesn't really produce that much horsepower and the acceleration isn't really all that great. However, the car will compete (in speed and acceleration) with most other cars in its price range, and I believe it has superior styling. The main aesthetic drawback is the huge wheelgap. It is significantly larger than most other cars in its price range. However, dropping the car a few inches wont really cost that much and there are several places that can do the task for you. Driving the car really is a joy, it has great sports car handling and although I would prefer a V6 for acceleration, not too many cars will hit 60 mph before me; especially if your Eclipse is stick. Any person who enjoys being looked at, but doesn't really have thousands of dollars to invest in a sports car should consider the Eclipse. Unless of course you live in Miami; I like attracting all the attention...<br><br>
