            When I first saw the 'teaser' commercials for the Lincoln LS at the end of last year, even before I knew what it was, there was no doubt in my mind that I would be driving it in 2000.  Finally on March 1st I showed up at the Lincoln dealership to see what all the fuss was about in person.

My first impression as to the exterior was the fact that there is not one single line out of place.  Every curve, from the nose to tail was where it should be.  The aggressive nose demands respect and the BMW740i type tail keeps others wondering what just passed them on the highway

I stood in front of the LS for the first time and looked at the distinctive Lincoln grille, BMW type head lights and integrated fog lamps that seamlessly fit into the front bumper, I was falling in love!  I walked around to the side and looked at the extra long wheel base and raked roof.  The car whispered 'Autobahn' as it proudly sat glistening on the dearler's lot. Surely this was a BMW?  Mercedes?  Lexus?  Wait a minute, it has Licoln badges on it?  Could it be?!!!  Could an American car maker finally have gotten it right...read on.

The true proof of the pudding is in the eating (if you'll excuse the cliche).  The dealer handed me the keys and I slipped inside.  The leather sports seats hugged me as I slipped into the interior.  Noticibly, everywhere that I touched was leather; The steering wheel, the seats, the drivers side roof handle, the right arm rest, so off we went.

I gingerly drove off of the lot, afraid to break her, I could see the salesman shaking his head as I looked into the rear view mirror.  The test drive was pretty normal, I wasn't going to put this car at risk.  However as we were returning, there was a jug handle turn that swung around in a 180 degree arc.  I approached it at around 55 mph and began to brake.  The salesman simply said: &quot;take your foot off of the brake and trust the car&quot;, so I did.  As we barrelled around the curve, the LS was glued to the road, it's 17' alloy, 5 star rims, low profile tires and sports suspension begging for more!  The speedometer never dipped below 50 as the cornering G's increased!!!  The LS never felt out of control, never skipped a beat, hell, the tires didn't even squeal.

An hour later I was the proud owner of a 2000 LS with the sport package (17&quot; wheels, 1&quot; lower suspension, etc..) Did I mention a big honking 12 speaker (2 sub woofers) 200+ watt Alpine stereo with 6 disk changer.  This ain't no Lincoln Continental homeboy! Ok, there is ONE option I didn't get...the Cell phone (analog). My only disappointment was that there was no GPS Navigation system.  I had to buy one from Garmin and it now sits on my dash, I highly recommend it.

Three months later, my Deep Wedgewood Blue LS is a joy.  I notice the stares of Lexus, BMW, and Benz owners as I sit in line at the tollbooth.  I notice other drivers pointing at me in my rear view mirror as I blow past them on the Turnpike.  Most of all, I am more than proud to roll down my windows and happily answer the questions of other car owners as they say, &quot;Beautiful car, how do you like it?!&quot; on a regular basis. 

Just the other day, I picked up my fiance at Newark Airport, and as we were waiting in line to pay the parking lot fee, she turned to me and said, &quot;those guys in the next lane are staring at your car!&quot;  No big deal anymore, I smugly replied, you get used to it.

Before buying my LS, I was intent on buying the BMW 528i (sports package).
My best friend has one and cautioned me that if I get the sports package on the LS, it will certainly produce a harsh ride, and I would feel every bump, just like his 2000 BMW 528i.  I most happily advise him that the ride is simply perfect and, au contraire, I DON'T feel every bump with the sports package or any of the rattles and / or bumps that he got for the first 8000 miles.

I've seen reviews of the LS commenting how 'bland' the styling is.  I couldn't disagree more.  The stlying is CLASSIC luxury sedan.  Look at the BMW and Benz.  There are no fandangles and spoilers and vents, et al hanging all over the car.  If you want that, buy a Pontiac Bonneville or Grand Am SSE and you will find all the garish pieces of useless plastic that you can handle.

The LS is a refined, conservative, beautiful WORLD CLASS car that will garner stares, smiles, finger pointing and ooohs and ahhs from your fellow motorists.  But most of all, it will raise your pulse, and as you realize that you now only drive in the left lane on the highway, look into your vanity mirror, do you see that?  That's called a fat grin, and you'll notice that it hasn't left your face since you bought your LS.  

Make no mistake, Lincoln is the first American car that can sit proudly in a parking lot full of German and Japanese luxury cars without batting an eye.  And the best thing is the price.  You no longer have to take a second mortgage out to ride with the 'big boys'.

I've found that I now leave for work a few minutes earlier and get to work a few minutes later, where does that time go in the LS?  Well, maybe I'll investigate it once I pull this damn silly grin off my face and stop taking the LONG way home.

BRAVO Lincoln!
