            I spent close to nine months shopping for my first convertible.  As I shopped, I had a few basic criteria in mind:  1)Usable backseat (My wife and I are starting a family soon, and it must be able to accomodate a child seat); 2)GLASS rear window; 3)Well-insulated top (2 and 3 are true necessities if you live, as I do, in a climate with all four seasons).  The Saab won out by meeting or exceeding those criteria on all counts, as well as in its performance and styling.  

Ride & Handling
I love the Saab 900SE ride.  It's not as soft as some, but prefer a certain amount of road-feel to feeling like I'm steering a boat.  It's not as road-hugging as some others, but then I'm not driving it in the Indy 500 either.  The Saab ride is a great compromise and makes it a true drivers car.  Torque steer (caused by lots of power and front wheel drive) can be a bit disconcerting at first, but once you get used to it, you barely even notice.

Engine
Saab also caused me to fall in love with turbocharged engines.  Many people think that bigger engines with more cylinders are inherently "better" and more powerful.  But the 2.0L, 4-cylinder turbocharged Saab puts many larger 6-cylinder engines to shame.  It's a heavy car (more on that later), so the Saab isn't a drag racer's dream, but it's got plenty of get up and go where it's really useful - like merging onto a crowded highway.  The Saab won't blow people away from 0-30, but from 40-70 it's a dream - a wonderfully smooth acceleration curve with very little turbo lag.  These engines are virtually bulletproof as well, Saabs have been known to run in excess of 1/4 million miles.

Safety
This car is probably the safest convertible on the market.  Saab reinforces the windshield pillars, supposedly sufficiently to keep passengers from being crushed in a rollover.  The SE model has antilock brakes and airbags and it's weight is a bonus in a crash.  While a Miata or MR2 may crumple, a Saab can take the beating so it's passengers don't.  Saab drivers walk away from more "killer crashes" than just about any other.

Value
New Saabs depreciate EXTREMELY heavily when they first drive off the lot.  Buying used is a great way to take advantage of Saab quality and fun and letting someone else take the depreciation hit.  The 1998 is a great used-convertible year - it was the last full year of production for this particular model and virtually all of the little bugs that affected earlier model years were ironed out by 1998.  Service can be expensive - choose someone to work on your Saab carefully.  I'm lucky in that I've got one of the best, most reliable Saab dealers in the country here locally (George's Imports of Kansas City).

Summary
This is the best car I have ever owned.  Especially with the optional rear windscreen in place it is comfortable to drive with the top down even with the temperature as low as 50 degrees.  The heating/air conditioning system works very well, and the seats are heated too.  Do yourself a favor - buy that Saab - you know you want to :-)
