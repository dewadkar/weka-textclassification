            The Acura Integra is a magnificent sports car.  It's acceleration is quick and efficient.  On manual transmission models, the clutch is smooth and responsive.  The price range is very reasonable for a sports car of such performance.  The body design is aerodynamical and provides for the quick acceleration.  The lowered design allows for quick, tight turns and reduces parking headaches.  One problem I encountered is with the antennae, when it comes down or goes up it sounds bad and sometimes gets stuck.  Overall I would give it a nine out of ten.  I actually own one of these and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced sports car.<br><br>
