            The BMW M3, hmmmm.

This car can be compared to alot of cars, although you can compare all you want and never really understand the comparison until you drive one. I have driven an NSX, M Roadster, Carrera 4, Supra Twin Turbo, and a 930 Turbo. This car hands down is my favorite. 

I have no valid reason why a 40,000 dollar car can, in my mind, outclass, out-handle, and effect you in such a manner as to tout it's superiority over cars double in cost. Honestly this car has everything you need and I'll explain.

1. 240 hp: yeah you might think it's wimpy..but when you drive it you'll also realize it's power is mostly in the low range. You will never have to worry about getting dusted at a stop light by a tricked out civic.

2. BMW handling: if I have to explain this I'm talking to the wrong people. let me just say WYSIWYG (where you steer is where you go).

3. 50-50 weight distribution: sounds like even balance to me.

4. ergonomics: perfectly located knobs, buttons, and dials. You fit into this car like second skin.

5. Style: Luxury look and feel, with the sportiness of a M Roadster...In my mind the perfect mix.

So really all in all you may look at this car and say &quot; yeah it's nice, but it's too &quot;yuppie&quot;...my advice who cares, all the more a sleeper. It may be an understated high-performance car, but BMW always plays the second guessing a fool.

&quot;If you don't like this car, and you think it sucks...fine
I'll pass you on highways, and blow you straight off the line&quot;.

A rather poetic defeat.
