            This is a great first car and it can not be beat for the money!

<B> Background </B>

I used to own a 1999 Nissan Sentra SE-L and I liked it except I didn't like some things about it. My big gripes were it lacked  driver legroom, a trunk release key on the remote fob, illuminated visor vanity mirrors, and map lights. Low and behold the 2000 came out and it had everything I wanted. When Nissan offered 3.9% financing for 60 months, I bit and bought a brand new 2001 Nissan Sentra SE with the performance package and a sunroof.

<B> Interior </B>

Nissan advertises that their goal with the new Sentra was to take the "compact" associated with compact cars. The Sentra does a very good job. As many professional auto writers have said the Sentra SE resembles a mini Nissan Maxima. Everything from the steering wheel design, black on white guages, and front and rear styling cues are from the Maxima. The only seating available with the performance package is something called "midnight" which is basically a high end sport seating (a step above other compact cars but still a step down from the high quality cloth on a Honda Accord). 

Where this car shines is the details. The visor mounted vanity mirrors are lighted, there is a trunk release button on the key fob, there are dual map lights and a sunglass holder on the roof console, the security system includes micro-chip encoded keys, the driver seat is 8 way adjustable (including for height), the stereo has 7 speakers including two tweeters mounted in the A pillars, and the front cupholders can hold large drinks without interfering with the radio controls (unlike my old Sentra). Finally, this car feels very solid. The doors feel heavy and solid, the controls all feel solid and a class up from the compact category. The interior includes the use of chrome in the door handles and on/around the automatic transmission.

<B> EXTERIOR </B>

Some people think the Sentra is conservatively styled. Personally, I like it because it is a classic styling that will not either stand out or look dated 4 or 5 years from now. The SE with performance package features fog lights, side still extensions, and 16" alloy wheels which are IMHO the nicest available on a compact car. I only wish Nissan had not put Firestone Firehawk tires on as standard, while they provide excellent all-weather performance, they generate much road noise and their dry-weather performance leaves much to be desired. There are also chrome accents around the front and back, which cue that this is a not your usual compact. 

When you take this car out on the road, the first thing you notice that it is extremely quite for a compact (except on rough asphalt and concrete, but that is mostly the tires). The SE with performance package gets "Stage 2 Performance Tuning" which means a extra-firm. If you like the ride in Buick's then, get the GXE which is tuned for those who like a soft ride. The car handles extremely well and has just the right amount of power assist.

<B> CONCLUSION </B>

My car cost about $16,800 (sale price not MSRP) and included virtually every significant option but a CD changer and ABS/Side Impact Air Bags. Compared to the competition which is the Honda Civic, Toyota Corrola, and Mazda Protoge it is a unbeatable buy. 

In short, Nissan will get a lot of future Maxima buyers from those who buy the Sentra now.
