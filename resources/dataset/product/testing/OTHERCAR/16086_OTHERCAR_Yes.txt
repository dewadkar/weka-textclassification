            First off, ignore everybody who criticizes the mileage. Nobody who buys a full-size sport utility should expect to get 30 miles to the gallon, especially if you have the V8. Be grateful if you get half that. Aside from that, the new engine is the best thing about the latest generation. It's powerful and smooth. It's far better than the old pushrod workhorse they put into the previous generation (which I also had). Unfortunately, I think my transmission is having problems. In previous years, the V8s tore the transmissions apart because they were not strong enough to handle the torque of the V8. Hopefully, this isn't the case now but... 

The steering has definitely been improved. The last generation was a bit vague. 

Jeep increased the size in every direction and moved the spare tire out of the rear cargo area. There is a lot more storage room now and the headroom can accommodate very tall people. On the negative side the redesign of the interior is terrible. The cheap plastic dash looks like it came out of a Dodge Neon and the plasti-wood trim seems to look cheaper every year. I especially hate the latch on the ashtray where I keep all of my change). It pops open all the time. So much for trying to keep the Jeep abreast of more upscale SUVs. The cost cutters really went overboard because they only put key locks in the drivers side door. Other complaints include misc. electrical issues. Nothing serious, just annoying little things. I attribute it to bad switches and shoddy quality control--or gremlins. Every time I take it in the mechanics can't seem to repeat the problem. 

One big thing I discovered, since I go skiing often, is the slim tire clearance. The shock literally only has an inch of clearance (when you go to the dealer look into one of the rear wheel wells). If you use chains or cables and don't tie them down securely (lots of bungees) they're going to smack the shock. Actually, there's a shroud around it but it's pretty flimsy. Perhaps Chrysler did this on purpose because my dealer tried to sell me these $350 spike things that attach to the wheel lug nuts. What I worry about is mud and snow getting caught between the wheel and the shock. If enough crud got caught in there, it could abrade the tire sidewall and eventually blow the tire(s) out. Up in the mountains, I checked often and did notice a lot of buildup. 

A word of advice for people who lease. Negotiate 4 new full new tires and get rid of the cheap OEM tires that come with the Jeep. OEM tires don't have the same lifespan as full retail tires. So if you lease for three years, you'll probably have to replace the tires in 2 years, depending on how many miles you drive. If you buy full retail type tires (the dealer will have them) this will save you money and be less hassle. Believe me, I speak from experience.
