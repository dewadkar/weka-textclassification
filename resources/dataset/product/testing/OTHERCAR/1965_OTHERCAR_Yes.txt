            Begin reading by knowing that I am a Nissan loyalist.  I have owned 4 300ZX cars, and have never had a problem with any of them.  As my family grew larger, however, the 300ZX was less desirable.  Step in Maxima.  The Maxima will outrun any of the four 300's I owned.  It is incredibly roomy.  Even with the front seats all the way back, the passengers have loads of legroom.  The leather seats feel perfect, although I wish I could make the lumbar support go completely away (although disengaged, it still feels like it is providing support, which I don't want).
The handling makes this front wheel drive car feel more like a rear wheel drive.  I'm reminded that it is powered through the front wheels when I lay a scratch in first, then second, then third.....  Again, let me reiterate, the power is amazing.
Comfort is great.  Shocks are great.  I think the only thing that I don't like about the car is that the perfect sounding Bose stereo has a CD player that can't read CD's that have the slightest of scratches.  If you buy one of these, only use perfect CD's in the player, or else you are going to get some stuttering symphonies where not intended.
Hands down, this is the best car I've owned.  It's actually a company car that I treat better than my own (now isn't that a strange reversal of the norm).<br><br>
