            Three hundred and five.

That's how many horses are under your right foot.

It's a little intimidating at first, sitting in the low-slung driver's seat and looking out over that hood.  You don't really know how it's going to behave.  And God only knows what it'll do to your head.  And for a few moments, you wonder if this was really such a good idea.

Then you dip into that throttle and hear that V8 rumble to life, and realize that yes, this was a very good idea indeed.

The 2002 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 is a lot of things.  Civilized is not one of them.  This is the final year of production for the F-body, which is being discontinued due to slow sales.  Blame the SUV for the death of this auto if you want, because you're probably close.  At any rate, this is one car that, like many before it, is being killed off right in its prime.  The Camaro is better than it's been since the 70s, and it shows in all the details.

The Z28 model I tested was equipped with GM's LS1 V8.  This 5.7-liter OHV small-block generates a published 305 horsepower and over 330 pound-feet of torque.  In a car this size, that is a great deal of get-up-and-go for your money.  It's enough to move this thing to 60 in about five seconds, and pull consistent 13-second quarter mile times.  This car is all about the engine, and this motor's a jewel of high performance.  Yet, despite this performance, the Camaro is capable of returning quite respectable fuel economy, one of only a few nods to civility.

The car I tested was equipped with GM's 4-speed auto with overdrive.  The shifts were brisk and hard when they needed to be, but never luxury-car soft.  You will know when this transmission changes gears.  A six-speed manual is also available as a no-cost option, but I was unable to test it as I don't know how to drive a stick.

Handling on this car is another one of it's strong suits.  The steering is quick and responsive, the suspension is hard but not bone-jarring, and despite the solid rear axle, the car tracks well in turns and holds the road aggressively.

The interior was comfortable, if a bit dated.  The seats are firm and supportive without being rock-hard, and all the controls are in easy reach.  Visibility is good except out the back.  The car is technically a 4-seater, but I wouldn't put my worst enemy in that sorry excuse for a back seat.

This car is among the last of a slowly dying breed.  The breed of real, affordable American sports cars.  As the SUVs continue to choke the highways and byways of America, affordable muscle is going the way of the dodo.  The Ford Mustang is the last affordable musclecar to survive, and judging by its sales figures, is probably going to last even longer.  The only other performance cars available are Japanese sport compacts with whiney high-revving 4-cylinders that sound like giant mobile whoopee cushions.  Sure, there's the 'Vette, but who can afford 40 grand for one of those besides midlife yuppies and lawyers?  The Camaro is one of the last real V8 performance bargains.  You owe it to yourself as an enthusiast to try one.  If not buy, then just take one for a test drive, while you still can.
