            As part of my on-the-road business work, I've driven many kinds of cars, but my wife's Neon is one of the better cars that I've ever driven.  Sure it's got a funny face in front.  Sure the new model has a big butt.  The fact is, the Neon wins out because of its versatility.

<b>Wherefore Art Thou Versatile?</b>

The Neon's versatility comes from its relatively small size -- being little means a lot.  Most of the rental cars I drive are barges that are just too big.  

My boss loves barges, but he lives out in the suburbs where the streets are wide because there aren't any sidewalks, and no one parks on the curb.  I live in the city.  In the city, a barge is always in danger of scraping its sides.  In city parking lots, there often isn't enough room for a barge to maneuver.  The Neon does just fine in these situations, and it hardly gets lost on a suburban boulevard.

<b>What Works</b>

I know I should cover this area in a review about a car, but I honestly don't think there's that much to say.  As a car, the Dodge Neon works.  It works well.  No funny sounds, no unexpected repairs, no problems with power.  The fuel mileage is average, which means not as good as it should be, but we're living in a world where pollution is the easy thing to do.

A Porsche it's not, and thank god.  Who wants to bother with one of those?  For the most of us, a car is a way to get there and back.  For us, it's the there and the back that's important, not the car in itself.  The Neon is stylish enough without letting the style take over.

<b>What Doesn't Work</b>

I have one little gripe.  Although the trunk space of the Dodge Neon is ample, its integration with the back seat is not.  Only part of the back seat folds down, making the seats higher and opening only a small portal to the trunk.  Unless you're carrying something long and very thin, this doesn't make any difference at all.  This design flaw makes the Neon great for carrying people, but not so great for hauling stuff.

<b>In Sum, It Makes Me Want to Say &quot;Hi&quot;</b>

All in all, I really love my wife's new Neon.  It does its job, doesn't complain, and fits into diverse situations.  The Neon helps me think about the demands of driving as little as possible, and in my life, that's a real bonus.<br><br>
