            My aunt bought a Plymouth Voyager when they first came out and I heard her do nothing but complain about all of the problems that she was having with it.  When my family grew MUCH larger, I knew that it was time to move into the minivan category when looking for a new car.

You get what you pay for, I guess, and for the most part, Plymouth has exceeded in quality, what you'd expect for the price.  Mine is a simple package, with stereo and cassette, air conditioning, and rear defrost, as we are a very middle class family.  I have gone to the shop once with it, but it seems to be very reliable, and is very comfortable for a large family. 

I don't know what lies ahead for me and my &quot;mini&quot;, but as far as how it has been treating me, I have little doubt that it is going to let me down.<br><br>
