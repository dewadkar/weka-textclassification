            I'm not new to digital photography, but I'll be honest - I purchased my last digital camera about 5 years ago, so I had a lot of catching up to do with the new technology! Most of the pictures I take today are with my Canon Rebel 2000 35mm camera, with a great zoom lens and lots of nice features, so I'm spoiled when it comes to photography.  After a couple months of research here and tracking prices, I determined what I wanted in a digicam(at least 2 MP, Optical Zoom, Small-ish size) and the Fuji 3800 ended up being one of my options.

I got a great deal on it at Buy.com, and since most other 3 MP cameras were a couple hundred dollars more, I figured I'd take a chance with Fuji. 

I like!
1) Nice compact size- but not too small
Both my husband and I find it easy to hold and snap photos. The controls are well placed - the zoom is a little different than some cameras, but still is thumb-operated, so nothing new there for me. 

2) Nice looking photos!
I tested photos first on the lowest quality setting and, while I wouldn't want to print those pictures for posterity, they're perfect for sending pics of the grandchildren to Grandma and Grandpa. The higher res options produce very nice quality photos, suitable for enlargement and printing.

3) Easy mini-movies!
The movie mode is very easy to operate, just flip the dial to Movie, press the shutter button once to begin recording, and again to stop. Audio is captured and it makes those little mini-movies so wonderful to share with grandparents. I still only have the 16MB XD card, so can't capture anything too long, but I didn't purchase this with the idea of using it as a camcorder, so I'm happy with the smaller durations. 

4) Nice macro mode
I do some selling on Ebay, and for that it's imperative to be able to take nice close-up pictures. This camera does a great job of that without distortion or blur.

5) Accepts adapter lenses
While I haven't purchased any yet, I can see this is a camera which will grow with me if I need it to. It comes with a lens adapter which allows you to add wide-angle, telephoto, or other lenses and filters for additional flexibility.

**Frustrations:**
1)VERY hard to focus in low-light
There is no auto-focus illuminator which, when I was looking at cameras, I didn't know was important. In short, it makes it VERY difficult to take pictures in low-light situations, because it might have problems focussing on the object. Sure the picture will come out because you'll have the flash activated, but it may be out of focus due to the camera not being able to find the subject.  

2)Viewing Software hard to use
The FinePix Viewer software is, in my opinion, not user friendly at ALL. I was annoyed by its setup and found using my Dell Image Expert software much easier for capturing and manipulating photos. 

3) EVF and LCD are very low-res
This may or may not bother some people. I guess I was hoping for more accurate portrayal of the pictures I just took on the LCD or EVF (electronic viewfinder). But both of them are so low-res, that all images, even the best quality, appear grainy when viewing on the LCD. It's not til you transfer them to your computer that you can truly appreciate how crisp they are.
