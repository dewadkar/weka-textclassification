            I bought this vehicle because of it's looks,(silver SE)the way it 
ran, the seat options, and the reliability of a Nissan. To my surprise,
I've had those minor, little irritating things that you don't expect
of a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan. I've owned Toyotas and Hondas and have
not had these troubles. This is my first Nissan and I hope my van is an
exception, because I am disappointed so far. We leased it less than a 
year ago and one of the cup holder's doesn't work...the window on the passenger-side sliding door leaks when you wash the van...a piece of rubber started flapping that goes around the driver's window...the windshield wipers decide to turn on whenever they want to...it often makes a BIG knocking/grinding sound when you start the car
and turn the A/C on or if the A/C is already on...I hope this happens
only when it's cold, but something squeaks terribly like belts or something; it's embarassing when you have a good looking '99' model
Nissan van and it sounds like an old clunker...and there is no leg room on the second row behind the front seats. Well, it looks good and runs good(fast)but I hope these are isolated problems. A friend of mine in church says he has had some of the same problems out of his...wish I would have talked to him before I made this &quot;quick&quot; purchase!
