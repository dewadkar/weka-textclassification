            I don't know where Land Rover ever got to be considered as a "prestige" Euro car maker. I owned a 2002 "S" for 2 years. I got fed up with the whole lousy experience and traded it in after only 13,000 miles.

A week after I bought it, it had a oil leak. That was only the beginning of the defects that followed:

Transmission software bug
Coolant leak
Cracked coolant overflow bottle (twice)
Cracked cylinder head
Leaking intake manifold gasket
Piece of roof rack blew off on the highway
Defective defroster knob

The AC is very weak. The FM reception is poor. The speedometer numbers are small and hard to read. There is no dipstick for the transmission fluid. The front brake pads produce a lot of dust. Many owners report needing a $500 brake job at 15 to 20,000 miles. Only gets 21 MPG on highway, not good for a mini SUV with barely adequate acceleration.

Dealer charge for an oil change $90!
The parts availability is slow, so even a minor repair could take many days. I became clear to me that because I didn't spend 40 grand on my vehicle my dealer treated me poorly. 

The resale value of these SUV's are horrible. Check KBB.com
