            This car has got it all.  If you didn't see the commercial for it a few years back, they had it on a race track, showing how it and a horse use all four legs/wheels to make turns.  It was pretty impactful and impressive.  This is a smooth ride and handles great.  It's got power and performance all in one.  And let's not forget the look.  This car is sleek.  It's a babe magnet, but that's not why I bought.  It helps, though.  It's one of the best cars for the price and Mistubishi gave me a great deal on it.  I couldn't resist.  It's a great addition to my collection.<br><br>
