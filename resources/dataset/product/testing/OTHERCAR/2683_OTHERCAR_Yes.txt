            I traded in a 1999 Ford 2door Sport Explorer for my Mercury Mountaineer about a month ago.  Never regretted it!!!  This SUV, don't know why there is not another class for stand-outs like this, has an understated feeling of quality that seems to flow up and grab you.  From the All Wheel Drive (AWD), don't know about you but I sure hate to get out in the middle of a blizzard or a mud puddle to manually engage the 4-wheel feature or remember the book - slow down to XX and not be in XX gear, to the electronic moon roof this vehicle has it all.
  I have had several SUVs throughout the years and the Mercury Mountaineer  is the peak.  The ride and suspension is so smooth at times I have to think if I am moving or not.  The rear seat 60/40 split is just right to get in that extra long yard sale purchase and still carry 2 adults in the rear.
  AWD smoothly engages only when needed, most people buy a 4-wheel option and use it less than 10 percent of the time, with AWD you don't even think about it but it is there all the time. 
  Equipped with the 5.0 V8 the Mountaineer may not be a Mustang but it's not to far behind.  When you press the &quot;pedal to the metal&quot; for fun or to keep up with traffic, a fully loaded Mountaineer smoothly pulls up to and out of any situation, even fully loaded with 5 adults and baggage.

  In summary this SUV is that step above the average, and that little extra reward most SUV drivers are looking for.  <br><br>
