            With our large family we realized that we needed something a bit bigger than the extended cab pick up.   We managed to find a 1998 Montero on a lot and was immediately impressed by it�s aggressive looks and an interior which is almost too convenient. 

Our Montero had all of the options when delivered.  We are still trying to learn all of the features.  Our 7-seat Montero, provides more than enough room for all of the kids as well as enough groceries to feed them.   We managed to pick up this SUV and find ourselves with well respected company (such as the Lexus LX 450, Land Rover Discovery and Infiniti QX4). 

 The 200 horsepower, 3.5-liter SOHC V6 and 4-speed automatic transmission provides all the power we will ever need.  There is more than enough pull to get us out on the highway as well as up the mud slick hill. Proven features of the 3.5-liter engine include a cast iron block, aluminum heads, belt-driven camshafts, roller-type rocker arms and hydraulic valve lash adjusters that eliminate the need for periodic adjustment. The engine also has electronicaily controlled sequential multi-point fuel injection, as well as a distributorless, 3-coil microprocessor-controlled ignition system that monitors and adjusts ignition timing to control engine knock and continuously fine-tune performance. To increase overall engine rigidity and reliability, the cast iron cylinder block incorporates heavy-duty 4-bolt main bearing caps and a full-web girdle that supports the crankshaft.

Mitsubishi�s Active Trac 4WD offers the luxury of four different drive modes. Two wheel drive allows efficient operation for most conditions, while for slick roads, the driver can choose shift on the fly all wheel drive to automatically apportion power among all four wheels to gain maximum traction.   Of course when the pavement disappears, shifting the Montero�s transfer case lever locks the center differential to provide conventional four wheel drive in low or high modes. The Montero driver can "shift on the fly" between 2-wheel drive (2H) and all wheel drive (4H) at any speed below 62 mph. In 2-wheel drive, the synchronized clutch allows the front differential to freewheel for maximized fuel economy and vehicle acceleration.   One feature of the transmission allows the rear differential to be locked.  This will pull the Montero out of all but the most extreme off road condition by providing power to the wheel that has traction. 

A fully independent front suspension with unequal length double wishbones (A arms) and torsion bars provides much of the Montero toughness while allowing extra long suspension travel so the tires can individually climb over rocks and ruts without compromising control. At the rear is a stability enhancing live axle precisely located by three links and suspended by progressive taper coil springs. The Montero rear suspension also provides maximum wheel travel while maintaining predictable handling and optimum control. Stabilizer bars are used front and rear to reduce body roll when cornering and enhance overall handling control. Aiding Montero traction in all conditions are aggressive P235/75R15 mud and snow rated all season radials.   And this is all done without sacrificing a comfortable ride.  

In this class, you'd expect the premium cloth or available leather seating surfaces and genuine burled wood trim that accents Montero interior; the standard air conditioning, and power windows, door locks, and sideview mirrors - but, it's really the small details that set this vehicle apart. It's equipped with standard dual front air bags, height adjustable front shoulder belts, plus 3-point safety belts and head restraints for all outboard passengers. Montero door lock system allows one turn of the key in the driver's door to unlock just that door, with a second turn unlocking the remaining doors and tailgate.  Montero has 12-volt accessory outlets on the console and in the cargo area, a cargo-door mounted tool kit that could almost double as a small hardware store, a portable inspection light, an LCD compass and outside thermometer, voltmeter and oil pressure gauges. 

A combination of the Premium, Cold Weather and Luxury packages adds genuine burled wood interior accents, a security system with keyless entry, 10-disc compact disc changer, spare tire cover, roof rack, floor mats, wheel locks, plus a cargo area cover, protective mat and net, leather seating surfaces, power driver's seat, enormous power glass sunroof and Infinity� premium audio system with eight speakers, chrome wheels, driver adjustable 3-stage variable shock absorbers (which allow soft, medium or hard settings), locking rear differential, headlamp washers, heated front seats and exterior door mirrors.

When not hauling kids, our Montero has over 67 cubic feet of cargo due to it�s 50/50-split fold second row seat and  third row seats easily fold up and out of the way when not in use. 

Our Montero is equipped with a large disc brake at every corner. The front features dual piston calipers and ventilated rotors that resist heat build-up and fade, even under repeated hard use and long descents. Multi-Mode 4-wheel, 4-sensor, 3-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) functions in every drive mode, unlike some competitive systems that are disengaged in 4-wheel drive. This system's superiority comes from advanced technology, which automatically tailors braking performance to the road surface. In 2-wheel drive, Multi-Mode ABS operates for maximum stopping power on paved roads, while in all-wheel drive, the ABS is tuned for slippery surfaces. When in 4-wheel drive, ABS is adjusted to perform best on rough terrain. Multi-Mode ABS is even specifically designed to operate when the optional locking rear differential is activated in especially difficult conditions.

With all of these amenities, you would think that I could not find something to complain about the Montero.  But you would be wrong.   The cup holders are a bit on the small size and not in the best location for my taste.   The drivers side hand hold is in the wrong space, I manage to hit my head nearly every exiting.  And what good are headlight washers without a small squeegie or wiper to remove the wetted dirt.

After experiencing Montero�s features, you'll have difficulty believing it's also one of the toughest vehicles around. Yet the exceptionally comfortable Montero proved its ruggedness by not only winning the brutal 1997 Dakar Rally, they dominated the 5,000-mile, two-week trek across Africa by taking the first three positions.    No other sport utility can boast Montero proven, rally-bred toughness, either. This was the first vehicle in the Dakar Rally's 17-year history to take first, second and third places.
