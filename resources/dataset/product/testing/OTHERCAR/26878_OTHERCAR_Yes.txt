            I owned a regular cab '87 Dodge Dakota until early 2002.  Purchased a 2000 Dakota Quad cab for its convenience, looks, passenger room, and hauling capability.  I have three friends that own V8 models, and all three report gas mileage of 12 mpg, in town, and 16 mpg on the highway.  The model I opted for has the V6, and I get 15mpg in town.  The V6 power is not overwhelming, but the truck will accelerate quickly when needed.  Wouldn't want to pull a huge boat or trailer, very far however.  The non-four wheel drive Dakotas sit a little lower than the four wheel drive version.  No surprise there.

The automatic transmission is smooth, and has an overdrive that drops the RPM's way down around 2150 RPM at 65mph.  This is one of the reasons this truck is so quiet on the highway, besides the ergonomic positives of the passenger compartment.

As far as the passenger compartment, the back seats have a little more legroom than the Ford Explorer.  The seat is a 80/20 split.  Both sections lift easily with one hand to become vertical and fold back against the seatback for that extra internal storage space.  A suitcase fits nicely in the spot behind the driver's side when the 20% is tilted up and out of the way.

The AM/FM/Tape stereo is tremendous for a factory unit.  Thought about replacing it with an aftermarket, and realized it would be only a lateral move.  Even the speakers are great.  As a serious stereo guy, this was a big surprise for me there.

The front seat has a fold down armrest/storage compartment, which turns the front into a two seat version.  My youngest likes to tilt the arm rest up and out of the way to sit in the middle, but an adult would not fit very well in the same spot.

Glove box is fairly good size.

A complaint from those who don't have it, is the need for rear defrost.  The rear defrost works great on my truck, and also heats both rear view mirrors.  A must if you store your truck outside.

The bed of course, is very short.  If you've owned a truck with an 8 foot bed, you might miss the extra length.  I find the extra internal space vs. shorter bed length a good trade-off.  

Parallel parking is easy, and visibility is very good in all directions.  As far as handling, the non-four wheel drive version leans very little in turns, and handles nice in city traffic.  The four-wheel drive version leans more, and ride quite as smoothly.  Although I own the non-four wheel drive version, I test drove a couple with four wheel drive extensively, and this really came to my attention while driving around town.

Overall this is a very handy truck for those with families, or require bigger passenger compartments.  Very handy for those occasional trips to the gardening store, hardware store, or the ever present, "can you help me pick up my new big TV?" type of situations.
