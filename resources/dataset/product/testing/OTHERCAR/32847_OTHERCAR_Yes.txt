            My siblings and I purchased this great digital camera for our Dad this last X-Mas.  He obviously likes it because I seem to get a email with a photo attached to it at lease once a week.  He knows how to use it, but having done the research myself, I probably know a little more than he does about this camera.

<B>What You Get</B>

A delightful cardboard box.
1 Nikon Coolpix 880 Digital Camera
1 8 Megabite compact flash memory card
1 synthetic camera thing you can attach to the camera and then put around your wrist in case you lose grip of the camera. (I don't know the proper name for this.)
1 Set of usefull instructions
1 battery that will last for about 3 hours.


First off, although some of you may already know the specs and some of the great features this camera offers, I will list them anyways because I have been yelled at for not doing so on other occasions.

<B>3.34 Megapixles!</B>
This camera is top of the line when it comes to picture quality and clarity. 3.34 megapixles is close to the top of what they have out there right now, so this camera ain't too shabby. Resolution reaches up to 2048 x 1526 for surep clear picture quality.

You get a great 2.5x zoom lense with this camera, plus a 4x digital zoom. Auto focus is a nice feature that many cameras have now a days, including this one. This camera will clearly focus as close as 1.6 inches from the lense.

Another nice thing you can do with this camera is take 40 second 15 fps (frames per second) jpeg movies.

Scene Mode is another nice feature. There are 11 different scenes pre-programed into the camera for shoting when its dark, light, sunset, and so on. You can also program your own personal settings after you get the hang of the camera and how it takes pictures in different lighting scenes.

1.8" 110,000 dot real time LCD monitor allows you to see what the picture would look like if you took it at that moment.


<B>What I Think</B>

I think this is one of the best cameras you can buy for the money. I have seen the quality of the pictures, and even if you set the memory card to a lower setting, to save space, the pictures are still great.  I only saw one photo actually printed out on nice photo paper, and it was on a cheap printer, but it looked good, better than I expected.

One recommendation is to buy the rechargeable battery and the battery charger. The Li-ion energizer batterys are expensive and don't last long, so if you buy 2 rechargable batteries you can have one in the camera and take a spare one along if it runs out.

This camera is compact, and loaded with features. I am no camera expert, but I am sure this camera will be able to do anything you would want it to do, as far as taking pictures is concerned. = ) I hope this has been helpful.
