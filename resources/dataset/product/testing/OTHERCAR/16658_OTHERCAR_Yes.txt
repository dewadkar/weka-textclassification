            After spending many hours reading reviews and opinions on the Web, I bought a new 2003 Tribute and it has been plagued with problems. There is so much that I like about this SUV, but there appears to be a serious quality control problem. 

Within the first two weeks when I had only put about 400 miles on the car (100 going back and forth to the dealer), water poured in through the roof during the first rain storm, leaving puddles in the front passenger seat (so much for my leather). It also came through the back of the vehicle and ran into the wheel well. Since then, water has also leaked through one of the side doors. There is also significant rust under the dash.

Apparently the Tribute left the factory without being properly sealed. I am in the process of trying to get a new vehicle. Mazda Consumer Compliance has been polite, but I do not seem to be making much progress.

Based on the road handling, features, and styling, there is no other SUV on the market that comes close in my opinion. It is fun to drive, has plenty of room, and is very comfortable without losing the feel of a SUV. However, the problems with quality control tarnish an otherwise fantastic car. My wiper motors are already beginning to grind, the switch on the driver's seat heater has had to be replaced, the dash squeaks while driving, the exterior mirror heaters do not appear to be working, etc.

If you are going to get a Tribute, I would recommend that you have a reliable dealership close by that can fix any problems you might have.
