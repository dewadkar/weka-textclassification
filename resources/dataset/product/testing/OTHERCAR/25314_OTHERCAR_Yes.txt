            I've been waiting all my life for the Nikon Coolpix 5700; compact, enormous zoom range, tack-sharp images and very affordable.

I've been involved in photography for 35  years and have owned dozens of cameras, several darkrooms, etc. over that time period. Gone are the days of 40 pound camera bags filled with a color body, a black and white body, 5 or 6 lenses, a ttl flash, etc. Gone are the days of damp, smelly darkrooms and mail-order photofinishing.

Welcome to the 21st century where digital darkrooms and digital cameras have become both capable- and affordable!

After owning several digital cameras over the past 5 years I was itching for something with more resolution, more zoom options, more user controls. The Nikon 5700 caught my interest as offering most of the features of the D100 and Fuji S2 but without the size and cost associated with these pro-level cameras.

With it's 35mm-280mm (35mm equivalent) optical zoom and 4X digital zoom there isn't much this camera can't "see." The lens has great macro capabilities and produces beautiful images, deep color saturation, fine resolution (at ISO 100) and is generally a piece of glass worthy of the name Nikon.

I strongly recommend the optional AA-battery adaptor that attaches to the bottom of the 5700 (I paid $125 for mine) since the 6 AA batteries (I used Maha 1850 mah rechargeable batteries) provide all-day shooting power AND the base-adaptor provides a more secure 4-finger grip on the oh-so-small 5700. You'll also appreciate the 2nd set of zoom and shutter controls on the base-adaptor which are great for shooting vertical format.

The viewfinders are both pretty small- but adequate considering the compact size of the 5700 which you'll appreciate when you're carrying it around for several hours!

The software and interface provided work flawlessly and the prints on my Epson 2200 are BREATHTAKING!!

My only complaint is that the 5700 can "wander" in marginal light when it attempts to focus. So REALLY fast-moving objects (sports for instance) aren't the 5700's forte since the action may very well be OVER before you're focused and ready to shoot.

The 5  megapixel image quality is more than adequate for moderate enlargements; I do up to 13"X19" on my Epson 2200 without complaint.

There really isn't ANYTHING you could want to do as a photo enthusiast that the 5700 doesn't support from metering options, flash options and exposure adjustments to white balance and even the "best shot" feature which will automatically select the "best shot" of up to 10 images. 

If you're just getting into photography you won't outgrow the 5700 anytime soon. If you're looking for a quality 5Mp camera that you can enjoy withOUT getting a 2nd mortgage on the house you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for something that YOU can tweek and explore- but that your spouse can "point and shoot" you'll be pleased with the 5700.

This camera will keep me happily shooting for at least the next 5 years and by then WHO KNOWS what will be available? 25 megapixel cameras in our matchbox-sized PDA/cellphone no doubt!
