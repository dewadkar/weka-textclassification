            This is a piece no one should be without. The best should be on everyone's wish list. It lets you review your pic's on the color LCD. I've used others. But they do not match the expert looking photos, you can take with the Olympus D-340. I have took it on many trips. The photo I have taken are just a breath taken as really being there. There was no small little dots like I have seen on others. You do need a good photo printer to take advantage of this great work of art. One of the nice things about it is on longer have to buy film. Just download your pic's to a disk and you have it any time you need it. It is easy to put your photo on the web for anyone to see it, or you can e-mail your pic's to anyone you choose.<br><br>
