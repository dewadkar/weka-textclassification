            When i was looking for a new car, I researched many vehicles in the 20-25k range and choose the RSX based on features, quality, and performance. Many other vehicles where comprable or exceeded in features (granted many where additional options) and performance (some vehicles had better torque). However, the RSX by far exceeded my expectations in terms of style and quality. The style is the basic Acura format but expressed as a 3-dr hatchback. The leather interior is comfortable and clean. The dashboard is innovative, stylish, and comfortable; at night it's just cool to look at.

As for the sound system; it's adequate and crisp. standard bose quality and i prefer clarity over bass responce. so if you are looking for a "boomming" system you'll need to replace the subwoofer and the head unit at least.

Some cons though: there are some luxury options that are not even provided by the factory that some of the competitive cars provide like bigger wheels, HID, and LSD. This seems to be the only Acura model that doesn't provided the Satellite Navigation system; though although its neat most people only use it until its nostalgia wears off.

This isn't really specific to the RSX but this is a hatch back so it does suffer bounciness when going over speed bumps.

As for performance, the car has excellent handling around curves (even better if you get better tires) and has the extra umph. Its bi-modal so you can rev fairly high to maxamize on speed and take-off or choose a more economical method of driving and rev conservatively and still get good speed plus good gas mileage; something other fuel efficient cars lack.
