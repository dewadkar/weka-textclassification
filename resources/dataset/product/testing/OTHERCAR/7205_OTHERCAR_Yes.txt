            When we were looking for our latest car we were choosing between some entry level European models, like the BMW 323i.  At this time we came across a few articles that compared the BMW to this new Cougar, thus, we had to test drive it.  Our thoughts were, &quot;How could a $20,000 Mercury even compare to a BMW?&quot;  We soon learned.

We tested the V6 with a stick shift (the way we would have ordered the car had we chosen it), which compared to the V6, stick shift BMW we had just tested.  Driving and handling wise, this Cougar was a fun car.  It took off with the same vigor the BMW did, and it handled corners like a dream.  We were impressed.  It didn't have that level of perfection that made you respect the car, like the BMW did though.  I found that this was a car I wanted to beat on.

Unlike the BMW, this car had the traditional stiff suspension that sporty cars have.  You felt every bump, crack, and pot hole on the road.  This isn't a bad thing, but to truly compare it to the BMW this must be something to consider.

Comfort of the Cougar did not compare to the BMW.  The BMW could be called a small family car, this Cougar was not.  I am short (5'1&quot;) and I found the back seat to be way too cramped for comfort.  Plus, the back seat has a strange shape to it that only the butt of a stick girl would fit.  This is not a car you want if you are going to be hauling around more than two people.  Thus, it is a great college student's or single person's car.

The front seat and the interior just felt cheap to me.  Granted, we were looking at more expensive cars, but I get the impression that the seats in this car were also designed to be beat on.  In contrast though, when comparing the interior quality of this car to that of a Mustang, I felt the Cougar beat the Mustang out.

As far as the exterior looks, I like this Cougar.  I think it is a nice new design for Mercury and may bring the brand back to younger car buyers.  This car was a decent car overall (fun, attractive, etc.), just not a car designed to put a car seat in the back of (which was what we were looking for.)<br><br>
