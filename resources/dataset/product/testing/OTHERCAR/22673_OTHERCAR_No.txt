            I bought my 1998 Grand Am GT in May of 2002.  It was used, and had a lot of miles on it.  I don't remember how many, somewhere around 80-85,000 maybe.  The car is sharp, being black in color, with a stock rear spoiler.  When I first got the car, the A/C did not work, but nobody would fix it at the lot.  Turned out, the problem is that the a/c compressor is broke.  Parts   Labor = $700.  Ridiculous.  Car ran fine for a year, until around 110,000 it decided to start having several problems.  Had problems with the head gasket and heater core.  My car would overheat and smoke.  That was expensive to fix.  The Rotors and brakes needed fixed as well.  Overall, I love the car.  The CD player is handy, the 3.1 V6 is very satisfying, and the car is not a gas hog.  It's roomy and comfortable; ideal for road trips.  I have no problems with the handling, however, anytime I go over bumps, ditches, or annoying train tracks that I can't avoid, it's very uncomfortable.  The power windows were always kind of slow since I've had the car.  Just like any car, if you take away the problems you encounter, the car is great.  However, next car I buy, I would prefer a foreign car, such as Nissan or Toyota, for example.  They seem to be more reliable.  Don't let the negatives get you down about the Grand Am.  If you really take care of your car a lot, you should not have much to worry about.  It's a nice car.
