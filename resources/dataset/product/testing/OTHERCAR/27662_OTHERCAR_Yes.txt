            In April of this year(2002), I bought a '95 Hyundai accent. The first thing that impressed me about this car was the price. For a '95 model in goos working order, it was priced quite low.($1500) I took it for a test drive and loved the comfort of the front seats, and the small design (which is great for me.) 
Soon after I bought the car, I took it to friend for a tune up. After he finished working one the car, he told me that is was very easy to work on, because of the way everything is positioned under the hood. On subsequent occasions, while I was doing something under the hood, I noticed the same thing.
After I had driven my car for a while, I noticed it got great gas mileage. I put a lot of mileage on my car, and only have to fill it up every week or so. Another thing I noticed is that the speakers are relatively good. My brother (who loves rock music) commented about how good the bass was. I could not argue with him.
One good thing about having a Hyundai is that I can take it to a Hyundai dealer to have it worked on. The people at the dealership are very friendly, and I have not had any problems worth mentioning.
The only negative thing about this car is the lack of room in the back seat. I occasionally have to carry my 6'3" brother in the back seat, and he complains (loudly!!!).
Over all, I am quite satisfied with my Accent.
