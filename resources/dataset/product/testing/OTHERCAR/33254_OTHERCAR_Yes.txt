               It's a reasonable size at about 7 W x 5 H x 4.1 D.  It's lens is from 9mm to 36mm (equivilant to 35mm to 140mm on a 35mm camera).  It has a manual zoom, nice for the professional photographer, and it has a few nice flash options.  The flash options are automatic, fill-flash, red-eye reduction, slow-synch and low-light which involves a unique iESP scene-detecting flash.  It can store information in JPEG or TIFF format.  However, it can only store 2 noncompressed SQH images, 7 RAW and 11 SHQ.  
   However, there are two places where this camera really shines:  It's maximum resolution is a whopping 2240 x 1680!!!!  Wow!  That's pretty good, not the best I've seen, but it's still one of the best.  The other place where this baby shines is that it has a lot for both a CompactFlash card and a SmartMedia card (a 32 MB card is included).  Images can be copied from one card to the other.  Wow!   Is that cool or what?  Now you can just (with an AC adapter) use both cards, but only need one way to transfer your images to the computer.  My suggestion is to go out and buy a FujiFilm SmartMedia Adapter (it looks like a standard 3.5 disk but your SmartMedia card pops into the slot.  Now you either have a high capacity disk {you can store stuff other than just images on the Smartmedia card you know.  This way, anybody who has a computer can see your photos (not all computers can &quot;see&quot; all images, remember).  the LCD panel is a 1.8-inch TFT.
    The power sources are 2 lithium batteries, a CROV3/Lipo battery with an optional grip, four AA NiMH batteries or four AA lithium batteries There is an optional C7AU-AC charger.
    The bundled software is Olympus Camedia Master 2.5 image-editing software and adobe Photoshop LE.  Even though it is Photoshop, the best of the best (in my opinion), I would personally go out and buy Photoshop 5.5 (or whatever the latest version is).
   A few of the highlights of this camera is that its 4.1 MP SLR (MegaPixel Single Lens Reflex) offers TruePic technology for flexibility and professional photographic quality.
