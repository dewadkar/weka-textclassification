            I bought a new 1991 Camry in July 1991.  This, without a doubt, has been the most amazing vehicle I have ever experienced.  It currently has 197,000 miles and get ready, I am about to tell you what I have had to do to it since I purchased it.  One new battery, one new cv joint, a new alternator, and a water pump.  Of course the normal things have been done also, brakes, rotors, tires, etc., but the four items listed above are the ONLY repairs that have been made to this car.  The four cylinder engine, in my opinion, is not powerful enough for the car, but I like a lot of get up and go.  It has the coldest air conditioner I have ever owned and overall it has been a definite pleasure to drive.  I am about to sell it because I bought a new Corolla and I have too many vehicles to pay insurance on.  The person that gets this baby, or any other well maintained '91 Camry will not be sorry.
