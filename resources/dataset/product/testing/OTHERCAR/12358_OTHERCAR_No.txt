            Chryslers have never had great reputations when I was growing up. From the rust-prone Volare's and Aspens to the disposable K-cars and the tin-can mini-vans, Chryslers beat GM to the punch for successfully badge-engineering its cars without building in quality.

When my car was in the shop, the dealership arranged for me to have a 2002 Sebring Convertible for a couple days.  Brand new, the dealership was anxious for me to try out the car as they were thinking about a Chrysler franchise and they wanted their BMW clientele to be guinea pigs for Chrysler cars.

<b>Walk around</b>
The Sebring convertible is a nicely proportioned car. A two door convertible, the Sebring has a power roof with a glass window as well as a back seat so it can carry 4 people handily. Unlike the mission of say a Miata, the Sebring is for boulevarding, not for driving any twisties around the beach.

Styling-wise, the Sebring is a nice looking car if a bit too much of the corporate Chrysler aero-look. Can anyone tell the difference between a 300M and a Concorde or Intrepid?

Inside, the cockpit of the car looks like a serious driver environment until you start noticing the huge gaps between the door panels and the dash, the air vents and the console. The ergonomics are half-finished because this automatic Sebring didn't have the gear-selector lit at all, making gear selection and hunt-and-peck affair.

As a front-wheel-drive car, the Sebring is extremely nose-heavy. It's steering mushing and numb. The tires are soft and insulating. The seats are plush.  The entire driving experience reminded me of a Ford LTD I used to drive in the 1980's complete with the one-finger power steering.

With the success of the PT Cruiser, Chrysler definitely has the skill set to make the Sebring a tighter car. Presumably for its target audience - I read that the Sebring convertible is the best-selling convertible in North America - the Sebring doesn't need to be a sports car but for someone like me, an import driver, this kind of car would never be on my short list to buy or lease.
