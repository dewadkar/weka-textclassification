            I am the proud owner of a 1998 Lincoln Town Car, a generous present from my grandparents. Although I love the car, it is definitely not meant for winter driving --  especially winter driving in Central New York, which often means slippery and sometimes impassable roads and blinding snow. My parents tried to tell me this at the beginning of the winter, exhorting me to look for another car, one that would be more suited to winter driving. However, being the teenager that I am, their warnings went unheeded. However, I am now older (well, by two months) and certainly wiser, and about a month ago, I went to look for a winter car. My friend told me that she was going to sell her "baby", a 1988 Audi 90 quattro sedan, at a dirt cheap price, so I went, drove the car, and bought it for $1600.

When I bought the car, it had approximately 147,500 miles on the odometer. I was a little leery of the mileage at first, but when I took it to the mechanic for a once-over, I was pleasantly surprised when the mechanic told me, "this thing looks damn good for an '88." Indeed, every major component had been replaced, save for the engine and transmission/clutch, which were both in excellent condition. Evidently, my friend spared no expense in maintaining her "baby." When I told the mechanic how much I paid, his jaw dropped to the floor. He told me, "keep this car and take good care of it, you've got a real good one on your hands." In the short two months I've had the car, I've driven it almost 5,000 miles. Here are some of my impressions and opinions:

<b>Exterior</b>
My car is finished in pearl white, with body color mirrors and bumpers. From the side profile, it almost looks like a hatchback, especially with its wing spoiler. It's not a big car, marginally larger than a Chevy Cavalier but smaller than a Dodge Stratus. At first it was disorienting to me, considering the land barge I've been driving. Some nice features on the outside include heated mirrors, headlight washers and driving lights. The drivers in particular do a great job of slicing through fog and blowing snow, greatly improving visibility. My car came with a set of Blizzak snow tires on the stock BBS rims, as well as a set of low-profile tires mounted on a set of pretty sweet 16" six-spoke rims (I'm not certain of the manufacturer) for the summer.

<b>Interior</b>
For what is basically a subcompact car, the interior is packed with almost every luxury imaginable. The seats are covered in black leather, with dual heaters and power adjustments for the front seats. The heaters are a godsend on the usually frigid winter mornings in CNY. The instrumentation is a model of simplicity, with large, round dials for speed and engine rpms, and smaller dials for fuel and water temperature. Between the speedo and tach is a multi-function trip computer that calculates instand and average mpg, miles to empty as well as three other functions. The steering wheel is a simple, black-leather-wrapped four-spoke affair emblazoned with the Audi four interlocking rings. The center stack has three huge AC/heater vents at the top, a row of switches (seat heaters/ABS/fog lights), the sound system (I installed a brand new Pioneer DEH-1400 head unit in my car -- combined with the stock Bose speakers, the sound is remarkable), and under the radio, a simple three-dial AC/heater control panel. Underneath the heater is a set of three auxiliary gauges (oil pressure, oil temperature and manifold vaccuum pressure -- don't ask me what that means). The center console contains the gearshift, handbrake, storage cubby, power outlet, and differential lock switch. The back seat is much smaller than that of my Town Car, but not uninhabitable by two average-sized adults (three would be an act of cruelty).

<b>Powertrain/Driving Impressions</b>
To put it simply, the Audi handles like a very small, nimble sports car on dry roads, and in the snow, the quattro all-wheel-drive works seamlessly to keep the car moving forward. The car has a 2.3 liter five-cylinder engine producing 130 hp. While this sounds like small potatoes, remember that this car is the size of a Cavalier. According to Audi, this car can accelerate to 60 mph in an acceptably quick 8.1 seconds. Judging from my own experience with this car, I would consider that a reasonable or even conservative estimate. The engine is hooked to an easy-to-shift five-speed manual transmission and a self-adjusting clutch. This car is almost a treat to drive in the snow, and when the going gets too rough, or in the unlikely event of becoming stuck, all one must do is push the differential lock in the center console and the car immediately becomes "unstuck." I have only had to do this twice, once when I had to extricate myself from a dalliance with a shallow ditch (an encounter which did no damage to the car), and again when I had to climb a snow-packed hill on my way to the ski slope. I like the control of the stick shift -- especially when the roads are slick, I can just shift into a lower gear to slow the car rather than use the brakes. Speaking of the brakes, I also like having the ability to turn the ABS off for more control. An added bonus is the gas mileage -- I have averaged about 26-30 mpg on each tank of gas, no doubt due to the efficient engine, small size and manual transmission. The car's small size makes it very easy to control in the snow, and a great deal of fun to drive on curvy roads. I so enjoy driving this car, be it rain, snow or sun, that it may be the one that I take to college with me this coming fall, rather than my Town Car.

<b>Drawbacks</b>
My number one complaint is not having a dedicated cupholder. However, the cubby in the center console <i>is</i> large enough to hold a cup. Nevertheless, this is a small complaint which is outweighed by the great many advantages this car offers. The only other drawback to this car is the potentially high price of repairs and maintenance. I have not personally had to deal with this, but I do feel that the car will be worth the extra money to maintain. 

<b>Conclusion</b>
I can say with the utmost certainty that I would be very happy having this as my only car. It is a very comfortable car in the city, on the highway, or on the back roads. I have had no drivability problems or reliability issues (it starts up without excessive turning or cranking even on a 10 degree below day and runs flawlessly), and I would not hesitate to take it on moderately long trips. I am lucky to own such a well-maintained example of this quality German automobile, and I would recommend this car to anybody.
