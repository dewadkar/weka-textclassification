            The new 2000 Frontier, by any stretch of the word, is small for a pickup.. For those truck buyers from the South, such as myself, we are used to the sight of a lifted Ford or Chevy, with 36&quot; tires, and mud caked on every surface. However, the Frontier may be smaller than its American cousins, it more than makes up for its size in handling and comfort. The truck gives surprising good performance, both on &amp; off road, though the handling can be a little tricky on the highways. I would however recommend staying away from the mud flats or sand pits in this truck. Although the 4-wheel drive is excellent, it lacks the sheer power sometimes required to pull you through the worst the woods can offer. For those looking for moderate cargo capacity, like myself, I recommend discarding the crew-cab option immediately. Although this option will allow you to seat 4 people comfortably in the cab, your overall bed-space is reduced dramatically, even with the package bed extender. Corner handling, from personal experience, can be a little uneven, and like most trucks, the tail is give to slip in sharp, high-speed corners.

All in all, however, you will get more than enough &quot;bang for your buck&quot; from the Frontier...<br><br>
