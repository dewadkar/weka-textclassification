            This is a update on the opinion I wrote for my Dodge Dakota back in January.The more I deal with this company the more unhappy I get. As I mentioned in my previous opinion the paint was starting to chip and peel on the bed,well since that time it has started on the doors. After taking it for another estimate to a local dealer and finding out a price for painting a small portion of the bed,which I might add was much more than I wanted to pay even with a 50/50 split,I called Dodge again to let them know I was still unhappy about this whole issue. About a week after that the District Manager called me at work to find out all the details and I very politely asked him if I was to get a estimate on my own instead of using a dealer would they honor it? My thought was a smaller shop might keep my cost down a little. He told me to get the estimate and submit it through the dealer I originally went to.   I called the dealer making sure this was not a problem and after getting the go ahead I got the estimate and it was submitted. After numerous calls to the dealer I finally found out that the District Manager and the gentleman that submitted the bid were meeting the next day to discuss the issue. Here is the good part,now keep in mind the bid I submitted was for taking care of all the peeled areas:doors,bed,and tailgate.Together they decided I had to take it back to the dealer for another bid. Are you confused yet? I took the truck back to the dealer and the bid he gave me was only about 200.00 more than the shop I got my bid at.How can this be I asked myself? When I originally went to the dealer to begin with the cost to do a small portion of the bed was outrageous and now the price seems to have dropped and I might add really dropped. I do not like to discuss figures,but what I am trying to say is I think I am getting taken for a ride.

I still do not have an answer and when I phoned the other day which was around July 24 I was told the gentleman I was to deal with was on vacation till August 1.I think what is upsetting about all this is every time I want any answers I have to call the dealer.What ever happened to customer service? I think what has to be even more upsetting is after all the calling I have done I still do not have any answers.I was thinking about putting a sign on my vehicle that reads &quot;Ask me how I like my Dodge Truck&quot;? At least maybe I could cover some of the peeled paint.   <br><br>
