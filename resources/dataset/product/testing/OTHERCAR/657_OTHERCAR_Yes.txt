            I used this camera after first using an Olympus C-2000Z and a Sony CyberShot F55.  I had assumed that since the others were newer that they must be better.  I had also believed the Nikon CP 950 to be a fairly large camera based on the photos on their Web site.  I was wrong on both counts.  The Nikon CP 950 was both small and equal if not better to its competitors.  The Nikon features a 3x optical zoom like the Olympus C2000 and a swivel lens like the Sony CyberShot F55.  Image quality is excellent and many manual controls are available - much like the Olympus C2000.  The interface was fairly easy, but not all camera controls are through the menuing interface.  Many advanced settings require the use of two hands to manipulate button combinations or button and dial combinations.  Luckily the camera has an automatic mode for those times that manipulating the controls is not desired.  The LCD screen is not the best I've seen and it really depletes the batteries quickly.  The camera also had a quirky way of switching between picture capture and playback modes - sometimes it would stick in one mode and I would have to turn it off and on again.  An update to the camera's firmware claims to resolve this problem.  The swivel feature came in very handy on vacation by allowing me to photograph my girlfriend and myself with Mickey Mouse by turning the screen towards me.  Battery life was fair - I've seen better (and worse!)  You will want to upgrade the included 8MB CompactFlash card soon after purchasing this camera.  The camera has a very solid feel aside from the memory door which is pretty flimsy.<br>
