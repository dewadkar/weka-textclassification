            I really dislike my Volvo.  

Although I was very excited about the Volvo at first, I quickly became disenchanted. 

FYI, I drive this car in a city setting, to and from work, on the highway some, but nothing major.  Within one month of getting the car, the driver side seat warmer did not work.  Soon thereafter, 3 of the 4 Volvo logos fell off the wheels, exposing a big bolt or something like that.  At about 9 months, a headlight went out and a piece of molding came off of the front.  Before I had the car for even one year (but 14,000 miles), I had to replace the rear brakes, AND the rotors because Volvo installed brakes that were rated to only 12,000 miles (but doesn't seem to mention this in the literature).

Also, the first year interior design is bad.  The center armrest has no storage and is very ridiculous the way that it works.  Every time you try to a drink in the center, the armrest slams down and breaks the straw (or worse).  Also, that headrest may be great in an accident, but it may cause one because it impairs your vision so much.  I literally had neck pains for a while after getting the car because I was so uncomfortable with how much it impeded my vision.  I'm used to it now, but I've had the car for 3 years.  The glove compartment is so small!  You can't put much more than the Volvo literature in there.  The main drinkholder in the dash gets stuck very easily.

I think they fixed the armrest quirk in the next year model.

RATTLES, RATTLES, RATTLES!!!!!

For all of you buying this car used (which you must be), this may not be as big a factor, but one of my chief complaints is that this car was SOOOOOO bad about holding its value. I spent like 29,000 on this car, and within fifteen I could not even sell this car for 20,000.  I'm basically stuck in this lease because the car depreciated so much.  

Compare that experience with my previous Honda lease experience.  I leased a top of the line V6 Accord with all the bells and whistles (compared with this 4 cylinder Volvo "with turbo"--no comparison by the way), sticker price was just over $27,000.  Two years (and 25,000 miles) later, the car was stolen.  The value that the insurance company placed on the car was right around $25,000.  That car depreciated only 10% FROM STICKER PRICE in two years.  Maybe that was unusual, but there is no excuse for the depreciation I got out of that Volvo.

I paid more for this car and got MUCH less.  I will never buy or lease a Volvo again.  This experience was very disappointing.  I kid you not, rarely a day has gone by for 2 years when I have not thought about how much I want to get rid of this car.

Maybe everybody DOES have a Honda, but I've decided there's a pretty good reason.
