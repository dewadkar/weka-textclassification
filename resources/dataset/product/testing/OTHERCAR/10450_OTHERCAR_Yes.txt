            I needed a used car that was attractive, affordable, and most importantly reliable.  After researching, the Integra was the car that was perfect for my needs.

I bought the car in 2002, and I have loved it ever since.  The more I drive the car, the more I appreciate how good of a car I have.   

Well first, lets talk about exterior.  The Integra looks very nice for a car that was originally designed in 1994.  Every time I see my car, I say "damn it looks good".  Seriously.  Some people might not like the snake eyes headlights, but personally I think it is one of the trademarks on the Generation 3 Integra design.  

As for the interior, I have the yucky tan color, and the leather seats have a texture that resembles sand paper.  I guess the previous owner did not take good care of her car.  Well, its not the best interior ever, but the controls are intuitive, and everything fits me.

In terms of performance, I believe this is where the Integra excels.  The car is rather light, so braking and handling are quite good for a FWD car.  The engine power is ok, I wish I had a little more power.  Please not that I have a automatic SE, so the GSR probably would satisfy my horsepower needs.

Overall, I enjoy owning an integra.  There are some minor problems though.  The moonroof chatters when opening, the windows rattle when half opened, my rear view mirror rattles, and the car generates a lot of wind noise.  I believe most of these issues have been resolved in the RSX however.
