            For Christmas my Husband surprised me with a Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640!  I was floored because I certainly did NOT expect such a gift.  I've always loved photography but really expected us to wait a few years before finding a digital camera we could afford.

Typically, I don't ask how much a gift costs... but I had to this time.  He had gotten it at the after Thanksgiving sale at WalMart and it was certainly within our budget!

So I have been using the camera since Christmas and I am very happy with the results.  The images are clear and crisp and the colors true.  I have had success in taking photos of large groups as well as close up photography.  

The software that comes along with the PDC-640 is very easy to use and really alot of fun.  My kids (8 and 12) have enjoyed 'playing around' with different images as have I.  The camera is small and easy to carry around and comes with nice little case in which to store the camera.

I would most definitely recommend this camera to amateur photographers as well as more skilled photographers.  Watch those WalMart sales papers!<br><br>
