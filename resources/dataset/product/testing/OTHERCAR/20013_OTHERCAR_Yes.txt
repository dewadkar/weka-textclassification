            I've had my Epson PhotoPC 700 for some time now and can't remember what it was like not to have it.  Probably one of the best investments I have ever made.  Not only do I never have to wait for film to be developed, but I can also view my pictures right away thus deciding if I want to keep a particular photo or not.

This camera came with a battery charger and the ability to add photo cards for even more storage.  The camera itself holds 50 pictures in it's standard mode.  Add to that the option of purchasing a thin little card that just slides into a slot and you can have up to 200 more pictures.  Not once having to wait to change film.

The convience of being able to load the pictures onto my PC makes it that much more appealing.  Add a photo printer to your system and you never have to go to a photolab again.  However, if you aren't able to print out your own photo's you can still take the photo to a lab and have them turn it into a hardcopy for you.

Some of the options include an amazing zoom.  I can zoom in up to 3x on any given item.  There is a built in timer for taking pictures as well as special features for taking close shots that show a lot of detail.  One of my favorite features is the ability to take black and white pictures with just the push of a button.  There is no need to carry more then one camera.  This camera can switch from standard pictures to speciality pictures with just the click of a few buttons.

The pictures are much more clear with a digital camera.  You can even catch individual snowflakes as they fall.  Have you ever tried to take pictures of fireworks with a regular camera?  I have and they never turn out.  This digital camera picked them up perfectly.  I would defanitely be lost without it.

Though it is a bit pricey, it is well worth the extra money.  The first week I had the camera it paid for itself just in the amount of film and cost for developing it would have cost.  The best part was that I only ended up with pictures I wanted.  No more wasting film on shots that just didn't turn out.  <br><br>
