            After playing with my friends' DSC-S50s for a while I decided that this was the camera for me.  My only previous other digicam was a cheap camera that couldn't shoot more than 320x240.  I love how the camera interfaces with the computer.  Just connect the USB cable and load the drivers and the camera shows up as a removable media drive on the computer.  This is quite convenient since I don't have to load or use a customized piece of image software to get the pictures.  The camera also has a built-in microphone and it can record short movies (the quality is not that great, but it's a nice feature to have around).  The LCD screen is quite bright and can be used in sunlight without any strain on my eyes.  The Memory Stick is cool, though you'll want to pick up a larger one when you buy the camera.  The camera ships with a 4MB Memory Stick which is good for about 10 pictures at the camera's lowest resolution (640x480) and about 2 pictures at the camera's highest resolution (1600x1200).  The battery gets about 2 hours of use, which should be long enough for most people.  The DSC-S50 is a great deal.<br><br>
