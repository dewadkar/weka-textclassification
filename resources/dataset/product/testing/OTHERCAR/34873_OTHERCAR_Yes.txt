            Oh how we anxiously awaited this new MINIVAN!  It took us 6 long months to get it. It would have taken 8 had we opted for the EX, but that would have forced us into the flimsy, overpriced factory car rack that you have to take with it!  Oh sure, we could have gotten it earlier than 6 months if we would have been willing to pay $2000 over the sticker price.  We are former owners of a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan.  The Grand Caravan is a GREAT family minivan which has been plagued with reliability problems throughout its life.  Our Grand Caravan had a nasty tendency to break down on Fridays leading to long weekends (it happened twice).  So when we heard about the Honda Odyssey, we bought it knowing that Honda has a great reputation for reliability.  Now, I suppose that if we had never experienced a Grand Caravan, this Odyssey would be a great minivan.  The fact is, it is a good minivan, but definitely not in the same class as a Grand Caravan.  It feels different from the start.  The seats are harder than the Grand Caravan and not as comfortable.  You get a cramped feeling when you sit in this minivan.  It is just not as spacious as the Grand Caravan.  Then there is the annoying shift lever.  The lever is directly in the way of the volume control on the radio which is very annoying.  The ride is smooth, but not as quiet as the Grand Caravan.  The one saving grace is the fold-down rear seat.  It is great.  Very easy to fold down and back up.  Yes you do have to remove the three back headrests, but Honda gives you a nice side net to store them in.  There is precious little storage elsewhere in this Minivan.  You get a standard glove box up front and a tiny storage box in the left rear.  The Grand Caravan has two larger storage boxes in the back, plus storage under the passenger seat up front.  Our Odyssey was delivered with a ripped passenger side door gasket.  It took our dealer three weeks to find a replacement.  As scarce as this minivan is, it seems that spare parts are even more scarce. This minivan is nothing more than a reliable Grand Caravan wannabe.<br><br>
