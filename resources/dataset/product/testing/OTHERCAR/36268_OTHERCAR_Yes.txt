            Corolla is one of the best cars you can get for under 12k(VE). It is very dependable, taking about 100,000 mi. before any repairs. This medium size sedan is extremely economical,34-38MPG,even more if you get a stick shift, so if you drive long distances on a regular basis, this is the car for you. The engine has just enough power to handle anything from mountain roads,(i drove mine to Big Bear many times, and every time i left many SUV's far behind), to long trips,(my farthest one was LA to Grand Canyon non-stop), to traffic-jammed freeways. 
If you're into fun, exciting cars, the Corolla is NOT for you. This is a dull-looking, nice-driving car, with absolutely nothing exciting about it. The interior is very functional, but nothing more; it's just a basic, inexpensive and reliable way to get around. The inside gets pretty loud at speeds over 80MPH, so you'll need a good sound system if you want to cover it up. It handles fine at speeds up to 100MPH ; over that, it might become somewhat unstable, so be careful. <br><br>
