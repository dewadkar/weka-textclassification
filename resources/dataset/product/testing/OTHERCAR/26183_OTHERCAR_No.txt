            I bought my 1994 Oldsmobile Silhouette van in February 1995.  I was originally planning on having more children so I thought that a larger vehicle was in order.  After looking around, I found that the Silhouette had everything that I wanted in a vehicle plus a few extras that were very nice.  The van has power windows, seats and door locks.  It has cuise control, AM/FM cassette, trip odometer, leather seats and a child integrated safety seat.  I first started having trouble with the van on my first long trip from Texas to Kansas.  The front end shook so much at 70 m.p.h. that I could hardly hold the steering wheel.  After I got back home and took it in, I discovered that the van had defective tires.  After replacing the tires it handeled much better but there was still a vibration at highway speeds.  On my next trip to Kansas and back my cruise control wouldn't hold going up a slight incline.  I had to manually speed up in order to not impede traffic.  The cruise control module has been replaced twice and will still not hold going up an incline.  Apparently, it cannot be repaired as I have taken it in for service on this problem 4 or more times.  It just will not down shift in order to maintain a constant speed and not lose more than 5 m.p.h.  The other problem is the air conditioning.  When ever the vehicle is &quot;pulling a grade&quot; the lower heater vent door opens up and dumps cold air on the driver's feet.  When driving on level road again the heater vent closes and no more cold air is blown on the feet.
The paint on the roof, just above the windshield, has begun to rust and corrode and I have less than 69,000 on the vehicle.
Even with these described problems, the seating is very comfortable and it is a nice vehicle to drive.  I just won't be buying another one.<br><br>
