            I'm the third owner of this vehicle.  I bought it just to get me to work and back but I've found that it really is fun to drive.  It now has 146,000 miles and it still runs as smooth as when it was new.  While the acceleration is lacking somewhat you have to keep in mind that this is not a sports car and was made in the days before SUV's were transformed into luxury cars with big tires.  Yes, there is body roll in corners and it can be quite unnerving to those not familiar with the vehicle but after driving it for almost a year on streets, highways, and off road I've never had it even on two wheels, much less tip over.  It's not a Ferrari and as long as you keep that in mind you'll be okay.

This vehicle was made back when SUV's were still considered trucks and is appointed as such.  No fancy stereo, no heated seats, nothing cushy here.  Everything has a purpose and is functional right down to the inclinometer in the dash instrument cluster.  It is rather spartan in both interior and exterior luxuries but for those like myself who want a four wheel drive vehicle so we can use all four driving wheels it does rather nicely.  The ride is pretty stiff due to the off-road design and it sits pretty high (hence the body roll) although the suspension and steering systems themselves have thus far proved to be bulletproof.  In fact, the only things I've replaced (outside of routine filters and oil changes) have been the muffler and catalytic converter.  The factory clutch lasted 119,000 miles before it needed changing but both the engine and the 5-speed transmission are still going strong.  In fact, even the original auto locking hubs still work!  I've taken this vehicle down some pretty nasty trails and it's never failed to get me home in one piece.  The low-range in the transfer is very low and provides the needed multiplication for the engine torque, however in low-range you are limited to three forward gears and no reverse (reverse only functions in hi-range).  It is apparently only intended for serious low speed high torque situations (which is where this vehicle shines).  

If I were to have any complaints it is mainly the limited availability of aftermarket and replacement parts.  This wasn't one of Mitsubishi's biggest sellers in that era so parts can be hard to come by.  The other main drawback is the small size of the vehicle (which for off-road could be considered a strength).  The back seat is nestled between the fenderwells and is only wide enough for two friendly adults.  Behind the back there is only about two feet of room, but the seat back can be folded down or the whole seat flipped up to make more room back there.  I can't fit my whole family in it at once, but then again that's what the family car is for!  There is, however, ample legroom up front and the feeling sitting in the seats is more like sitting on a chair, rather than sitting down 'into' the vehicle.  There is also plenty of headroom for the tallest person.  

Overall I love this vehicle and if given the opportunity to own another would jump at the chance.  Although its not a luxury car (or SUV) its tough, no-nonsense nature is very refreshing in a world where SUVs have become soft, cushy reminders of the trucks they evolved from.  If you want a car, buy a car.  If you want something plain and dependable you may want to give one of these a look (if you can find one!)
