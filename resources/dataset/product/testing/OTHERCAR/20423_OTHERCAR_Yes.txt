              When I was looking for a new car I was considering such cars as : Jetta VR6, Audi A4, Honda Accord V6  Pontiac Grand Am GTP, the BMW 3 series as well as a few others.  I had pretty much decided on the Audi and went back to the dealer for a final look.(the dealer sells both Audi and VW)  While at the dealer I noticed some new cars that were still in the plastic wrap that they come in. One of the cars was a Jetta with a 1.8t badge on the rear, I asked the sales guy about it and he told me that it was a new engine in the Jetta and that it was the same as in the Audi A4. This sounded interesting so I told him that I would be back to take it for a drive the next day.
  I drove the car and was sold.  It was amazing, fully loaded with every available option (leather heated seats, air, cruise, cd, sunroof,asr traction control, power everything etc.) this car was every bit as nice as the Audi or the BMW, if you can live with out minor things like wood trim. and it was $5000 less than either the Audi or the BMW.
  The car has that German feel to it, the solid feeling that does not come in most cars. Nothing seems cheap or flimsy in the car. Great quality of materials used for the interior gives the car a more expensive feel.  The leather used on the seats also seems like you would expect it to come on a more expensive car.(heated seats are unreal if you have a sore back or if it is a very cold day.) I opted for the Monsoon sound system w/cd this was a great decision, it is one of the better stock stereos that I have heard. Unless you are an audiofile this stereo should serve you very well!
  The performance of the car is also very good. It handles very well for the type of car that it is, it would out handle some sports cars. It is nice and tight but not too harsh for regular driving. It can handle speeds of at least 220km/h very well! (this as fast as I have had it.) The car came equipped with ASR (anti slip regulator) this controls the power sent to the drive wheels, if one starts to slip power to that wheel is decreased untill it regains traction. It works great, I have left 4x4's spinning their wheels in the snow at intersections!
  The power that the 1.8 turbo puts out is great and quite good for such a tiny little engine. While the car has enough power for most, for a relatively small cost of $549.00 I had a p-chip installed in the cars computer, this boosted the horsepower to an awesome 185.  In a car such as the Jetta this amount of power turns the car into quite little rocket! 
  It has been a year and a half since I bought my Jetta and I have been loving the car ever since. Another bonus is that the mileage on my 99 Chevy Tahoe is staying nice and low so that when I trade it in on VW's upcoming sport utility I will be able to get top dollar!
