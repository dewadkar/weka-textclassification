            I have been the owner of a Millennia S for over a year now.   I purchased it used (turned in from a two year lease) from a dealer. It was my dream car after falling in love with the 929 years ago.  My previous car, Nissan Stanza, being totaled while parked was a blessing.  

The Millennia is very quiet and smooth riding.  I once locked my keys in the car while running and had lunch in the mall.  I returned to find it as I left it, unnoticeably running.  Fortunately, I had a spare key with me.  I�ve made a few road trips traveling from New York to Atlanta, South Carolina and Virginia.  Such comfort made being on the road for a period of time a pleasure.  

When I knew I had to purchase a new car I did not have to decide what I wanted I only had to search for the best deal.  A two-year-old car with 14,000 miles, negotiated at $20,500 was all I needed.  The Miller Cycle Engine impressed me along with the cosmetics.  Leather interior, heated seats, moon roof, temperature dial, back seat closed compartment, upgraded stereo system (Bose); and rims, until it was time to buy tires. Big tires, dealers price $245.00 each (Michelin XGT V4).  I found the XGT V4 for $180 and purchased XGT V�s for $155.  The difference being speed capabilities, a 20mph difference.  The �Stick Key� is also very expensive to replace at $85, along with the keyless entry remote at $152.

The car also sits very low.  At 5�6� I sit with the seat as far back as possible, a very straight back, and the seat height control raised and my head is almost at the roof of the car.  My 6�4� boy friend has to keep the height control as far down as possible and recline the seat in order to drive with comfort.  There is no height control on the passenger seat and my passengers have told me that it feels as if they are sitting on the floor.  I must also mention my boyfriend tells me when I had the Stanza I always wanted to drive his �95 Avalon; now that I have the Millennia��.

My selfish side (15%) says no one else should own a Millennia, my other side (85%) says everyone should own a Millennia and experience the comfort and pleasure of driving that I do.
