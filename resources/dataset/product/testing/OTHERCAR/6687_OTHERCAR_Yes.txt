            I have had my Volvo C70 for almost a year now.  I bought one of the first that was available.  I bought the high powered coupe, the only option that I didn't get were the factory installed BBS wheels.

What can i say, to this day I am as happy with it as the day that I bought it.  It is fast (governed to a max speed of 155 mph) and really quick off the line.  the inline 5 cylinder engine has plenty of power to pull the car until you overcome what little turbo lag there is.  When the turbo kicks in, if you are trying to accelerate hard, the extra power is noticed.  The car is extremely quiet, even at high speeds with minimal wind noise.  the wind noise is only slightly louder at about 90-100 than it is at 55.  Although it is a rather large car, it handles quite nicely but due to the tight suspension, it can be troublesome over speed-bumps, etc.  The back seat in the coup is large enough for two adults, but not for a long trip.  There is ample trunk space.  I have fit three golf bags plus some other stuff all in with no problems.

There is no doubt what this car was designed for, driving/cruising.  It would be classified as a grand touring coupe, comfortable on winding back roads as well as at high speeds on the highway.

To date the best car I have owned, with others having been Acura, Lexus, Saab, etc.<br><br>
