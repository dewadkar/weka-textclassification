            My first venture into the SUV experience was with my 1998 Mercury Mountaineer, truly a good choice at a good time.  I went to a local Ford dealer to look at (and possibly purchase) a Ford Expedition.  Too large and too much money. I actually passed a Mountaineer on the Expedition test drive and immediately became interested in its looks beating out my earlier impression of the Explorer.  I went right to the Mercury dealer, test drove the Mountaineer, and 75 minutes later owned it!

This vehicle is very stable in that it has plenty of weight, holds its course going down the road (doesn't wander as did other vehicles), has computerized 4-wheel drive (power to whatever wheels need it dependent upon the road condition; power away from whichever wheel has lost traction due to road condition).  This is a very safe vehicle.  Highly confortable seating makes long trips endurable (along with good quality sound system as an included amenity).  Of course, not-so-fantastic gas mileage (10-12 mpg city; 14-16 on the long trip) is a concession to SUV ownership.  But my 1998 Mountaineer gets me where I need to go in great STYLE, in better than average COMFORT, and with EVERYTHING I feel like taking along due to the tremendously abundant CARGO SPACE engineered into these vehicles.<br><br>
