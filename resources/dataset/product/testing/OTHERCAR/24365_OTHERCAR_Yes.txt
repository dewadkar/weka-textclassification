            After owning the Sony Cyber shot DSC-F55 digital still camera for 6 months now, I would have to say that it is far superior to all other digital cameras I have used.  To begin, it not only has a super high resolution for still pictures (2.1 megapixles), but it also has the capabilities to take up to 50 minutes of MPEG video (with the 64MB memory stick), in one minute clips.    

Compared to other cameras that are lower in price, the biggest difference between them and the Cyber shot is the quality of the picture.  The other advantages to this camera include the very clear hybrid backlit LCD screen, and the small size of the camera.  Even compared to the higher end sony cameras, I would recommend this one to anyone who just want's the camera for fun, because of it's small size, and that it is easy to use.  One of the best features about the camera is that it uses the Sony memory stick. This new very small storage device, is now becoming more and more accepted, and makes it easy to transfer your pictures and movies from the camera to your computer.

Overall, I have been able to use this camera for all that I could imagine using it for.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a digital camera for any reason, as long as they do not plan on using it for advanced photography.  Also, upgrading to a higher capacity Memory Stick, will allow you to take more pictures.  This is the main reason why this makes this camera better that any camera with a self contained memory device<br><br>
