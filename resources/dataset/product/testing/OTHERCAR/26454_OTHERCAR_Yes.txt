            I leased a 1997 Bonneville about two years ago and I am very satisfied with its performance and ride.  This car is loaded from sunroof to compass and numerous gages and gadgets to keep you riding in comfort and style.  The roomy interior is a plus.  It is recommended for the family person or for the person who like to ride in comfort and style.  Had an oil leak about a year ago,  nothing major and it was covered by the warranty.  Handles well around curves and really moves down the road.<br><br>
