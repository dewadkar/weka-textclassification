            I purchased my 1998 Mercury Mystique LS in 1998, and it has been a big hassle!  I bought it because of reviews I'd read and because it was a somewhat of a luxury car for a reasonable price.

First the positive...

I've been very impressed with its handling.  It has a powerful V6 engine, which gives it a lot of power.  It drives smoothly and comfortably.

I purchased the leather seat interior, and it is great for looks and comfort.  I have taken this car on trips of 10 hours, and it is very comfortable.

The car is a bit small for some people, and it can be cramped with 4 adults in the car, but I prefer a smaller car.  It gets between 20 and 30 miles to the gallon, depending on if you are in the city or on the highway.

I've had many problems with this car.  First, it's had numerous recalls.  I received two or three safety recalls on the car around September 1999.  They also extended the warrantee on the heating fan, because it was known to break.  Indeed, it broke in my car, and I had to get it repaired.  It then broke a second time in 2002.  Finally, I received another safety recall in April 2000 and another in 2002.  I've also had several minor electrical problems.

In addition, the brakes are awful!  I've had to completely replace the front rotors nearly every year (about 15,000 miles) because they began to shudder.  I just had a brake job done in October 2002 at a cost of $300.  That's the 3rd or 4th brake job I've had since I bought the car.  Each repair was due to the rotors being warped.

In 2001, the O2 sensor failed, causing the "Check Engine" light to come on.  According to the mechanics, this caused the engine to run too rich, which also destroyed one of the catalytic converters.  The catalytic converter was covered under the emissions system warranty, but the sensor was not.

In September 2001, I was rear-ended.  I took the car to a Ford dealer body shop, only to receive terrible service.  They had the car for over a month, during which time nothing was done.  On the day that I picked it up, I arrived at the dealer to find that everyone at the dealer and body shop had been fired, and the dealer was closing THAT NIGHT!  There was one mechanic left to finish up all the work on all the cars.  Needless to say, they did a terrible job; the hood no longer lines up and the trunk remote opener no longer works.  In addition, the alignment was messed up, causing it to wear down a brand new set of tires.

Finally, I just took my Mystique to have some routine maintenance performed, only to find that the hood latch had corroded loose, and the hood would not open!  It cost me $110 and 3 hours of waiting at the dealer to get it fixed.  I don't know if this is a common problem, but it seems that it should not happen.

A few days ago, in October 2002, my check engine light came on again.  I'm eager to see what's wrong this time!

Based on my experience with the numerous recalls and other hassles I have had with this car, I would not buy it again.
