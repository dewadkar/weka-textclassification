            i'm a college student. this translates into a low budget. right when i was shopping for digital cameras, this one was put on the market. i unfortunately fell for the to die for cuteness and size and quickly snatched it up. i only say unfortunately because had i waited a little longer, the u10 would have been disconnected and i could have gotten the u20 for the same price (AND 1mb better of picture quality). with that aside...

pros...the picture quality is far better than what i expected. the size is sooo perfect! especially for females who do not want ugly, bulky things to stuff into their purses. and i say, the thing is durable too. i accidentally dropped it onto the sidewalk during a protest in san francisco. although no wrist strap comes with it, it has a little metal hole for one and you can easily purchase a cell phone wrist strap to use instead. the camera is very easy to use and the sliding shutter is convenient for on/off. the movie mode actually performs better than i expected as well, and well, it is a small camera so the lcd is small but crisp.

cons. the camera is clear about what it does and doesn't do. but i never realized that i would want zoom on a camera. whoever you are, ZOOM IS A MUST ON EVERY CAMERA or else you will regret it. but that's my own fault. the sliding shutter sometimes gets snagged open in my purse, but nothing a camera case won't solve. also, in slight variants of lighting, the picture changed drastically.

aside from that, the camera is pretty cool, small, chic, and trendy. when i pulled it out for the iraq protest in sf and chinese new year parade, everybody tried to look over my shoulder at it. definitely fun.

but, for the price, you can definitely get something with more features, including zoom, but they tend to be bigger and uglier.
