            I bought my Chevy 3/4 ton new and it now has 65,000 miles on it. The engine is a 350 and is perfect for this size vehicle. It has an automatic transmission, but I wish it had overdrive which would have improved the gas mileage. Very little rust for this area with salted roads in winter. Runs good and overall has been a reliable vehicle.

Things I don't like about it are:

When you work on it you never know which of the fasteners will be American, or metric, unless they are "Torx". 

The two tone paint job has metal flake silver paint in the middle which is peeling in 4 different areas. The red paint is holding up fine.
 
The wheels almost always get frozen to the hubs and are hard to get off. If you have to change a flat tire you will be lucky to get the wheel off with a sledge hammer.

The quick disconnect heater hose fittings are the dumbest thing I ever saw. Chevy engineers really made life difficult for the home mechanic trying to change the heater hoses with those things on.

The radio quits working from time to time. It just won't turn on one day and the next day it will be fine. They could have left space in the dashboard for bigger replacement speakers. If I ever order a new truck I will avoid the factory radio.

My truck has a problem with the battery going dead. It is intermittent but when it happens the battery will go dead after a day or 2 without driving it. The dealer said it probably has a short in the ignition switch but couldn't be certain because it was OK when they looked at it. I put in a battery disconnect switch and open it when the truck will be parked for more than a day.

The first set of tires wore out unevenly. I had new front shock absorbers installed and a front end alignment that seems to have corrected the problem.

I liked how easy it was to take off the fan belt. The belt tensioner is up on top and the job was a snap.  
Parts are reasonably priced compared to foreign car parts. 

On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this truck an 8 because of the engine and overall strength and reliability. It has some screwy new designs but the old Chevy 350 engine is still the best engine ever made.
