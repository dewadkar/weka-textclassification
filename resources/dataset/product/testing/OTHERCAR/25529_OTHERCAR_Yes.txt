            Before we bought our new 2004 Chevy Express fifteen-passenger van, my wife and I fought over the passenger seat.  Now, we fight over who gets the keys.

In November 2003 I decided it was time to retire our ten-year-old family van.  We both loved Fords and liked their look and ride and in no time found (what I thought was) a great deal on a used 2003 extended Ford.  But before we purchased it, my wife asked some of her friends with big families what they liked about their vans.  The Chevy Express owners spoke up and now I know why!  The safety features alone put this van in a class of its own.

If you're like me, you may not even notice an extended Chevy/GMC van when you see one because of the extended wheelbase.  For as long as I can remember, the tell-tale sign of a fifteen passenger van was the large portion of the van extending about two feet beyond the rear axle.  The Chevy Express/GMC Savana vans push the rear axle rearward twenty inches, so they look like regular full size vans with no overhang.  The trick to identifying extended GM vans is to examine the space between the rearward side door and the rear wheel well; if it's more like a foot than an inch its an extended van.

The extended wheelbase is a premier safety feature meant to improve stability and handling of heavily loaded extended vans.  A series of high profile fatalities from van rollovers prompted the US DOT to statistically analyze heavily loaded extended vans (read: not a real road test, but enough to understand the physics of a loaded van).  The study (see reference links below) determined that a loaded fifteen-passenger van becomes seven times more likely to rollover during an emergency maneuver than a lightly loaded van.  Many factors played into the cases they studied, such as driver experience and fatigue, but from a physics perspective the center of gravity of the vehicle moves up approximately four inches and rearward eighteen inches.  With more weight behind the rear axle (and a higher center of gravity), over compensation during an emergency maneuver becomes more likely.

The second major safety feature of the Chevrolet vans integrates the antilock braking system with the traction control system and a new system that detects when the vehicle is not responding to steering input.  In the industry this is called electronic stability control, or ESC.  Chevy calls this feature StabiliTrak and the 3500 (one ton) extended wheelbase vans are the only GM vans to have this feature (it is available on other GM trucks as well; see reference links, below for details).

The third major safety feature of these vehicles over the competition, though less glamorous, is the large crumple zone in the front of the van.  Those familiar with the tight fit of older GMC/Dodge and even newer Fords will marvel at the empty space under the hood.  A side benefit is the legroom between the front seats and the cowl (which is nearly under the dash on the 2004 Express).

These three features, none of which were available on the Ford or Dodge vans, prevented Ford and Dodge from receiving my business.  If I was offered the same Ford van I almost purchased, at half the price, I'm not sure I would buy it.

Beyond safety features, these are some of my favorite aspects of our 2004 Express:
&#149�Removing the seats is easy (no tools) and there are no obtrusive metal bars extending above the floor.
&#149�The rear doors swing wide open and do not restrict cargo access.
&#149 I love the sliding door, especially for tight parking spots.
&#149 The bench seat reading lights are shielded from view by the A/C ducts, virtually eliminating glare in the rear-view mirror.

Some features I feel are missing:
&#149�Automatic door lock when in drive.
&#149 Two words: Battery Buddy (I believe this is standard on GMCs).  We have one on our "old" van and we've never had to replace the battery!
&#149 A driver-side sliding door.  Driver sides swing-out doors are available on GM vans, and they are nice!
