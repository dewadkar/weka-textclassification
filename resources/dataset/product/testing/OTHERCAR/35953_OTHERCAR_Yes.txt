            As a first time driver, I own a '99 Honda Civic Sedan LX and I think that it is a great car.  It runs well and handles extremely well.  It is a great car and very dependable, as Honda has known to be.  The car has smooth handling and relatively quiet while in motion.  I like this car because it is stylish and easy to drive.  The car has power locks, windows, and a keyless entry. However, while going uphill, the v4 civic may have a little trouble handling the steepness due to lack of horsepower.  But for such a car, it handles the steepness nicely.  Comfort and quality are written all over this car! Anyone who plans on driving to and from home should buy this car.<br><br>
