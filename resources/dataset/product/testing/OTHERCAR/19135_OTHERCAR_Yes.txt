            The Passat I've driven belongs to my father, and let me tell you, whenever I visit him I do my best to drive it. 

The car feels very smooth in all respects. Ours is manual transmission, and the stick shifts like butter, at least compared to the other manuals I've driven. Acceleration is peppy, smooth and quiet, as is the wheel.

One superficial thing I really like about this car is the color scheme. The dash is a purple and red mix, and all the power controls in the car have little red-lighted icons on them. At night, with all of this lit up, you feel like you're in some sort of spaceship. It's definitely an eye-grabber. Additionally, there is a small display in the lower left of the dash that will show the time, temperature, avg mpg, current mpg, and several other FYIs. Beware though, it's easy to pay more attention to that little computer than to the road.

The car retains its spunk on the freeway, which is very nice if you do a lot of freeway driving. It passes with ease and hums along so nicely that you barely notice how fast you're going (both a good and a bad thing). It grips the road very nicely.

There is definitely ample room for four people in the car. Five is can get a little bit cozy but is also manageable. The trunk space is deceptively large.

I can't think of much I don't like about this car. If I'd change anything, I'd give it all wheel drive. I *believe* they were supposed to come out with AWD models, but I haven't kept up.

If you're looking for a practical and relatively efficient (28-30 mpg) car that is still a bunch of fun to drive, give this baby a look.<br><br>
