            Back in late 1996 I was looking for an SUV.  I had been watching the streets to see what I liked and what I didn't, and this is the story about why I picked the Trooper.

The Criteria: I'm 6'4&quot;, and I hate small back seats.  I seem to have a lot of stuff to haul, so large cargo space is important.  I also wanted to be high (no, not that kind); I wanted to see over cars, see over minivans, etc.  
I don't like the rear doors that open like a pickup truck.  I also don't like the 50/50 split doors -- reminds me too much of a minivan.  So I was left with the 70/30 rear doors.

I started my search.  The Land Rover Discovery looked great.  Until I saw the price.  Whoa.  Too much money, not enough for the buck.  It was out.

The Mitsubishi Montero was next.  But it was not pretty. I didn't like the style in '96, so it was out.

So I was off to check out the Trooper.  The sales guy had me look at a Rodeo first.  It was OK, but it wasn't what I wanted.  So I moved to the Trooper.  When I first climbed (being 6' 4&quot;, climbing into the vehicle was a cool thing) into the Trooper, I was way up there.  At first, I was a little uncomfortable in it, sitting like I was driving a passenger bus rather than an SUV.  But after the first drive, I fell in love.  I was above all the traffic.  I could see everything, including  cars in front of minivans.  I had a whole new perspective on life.

The automatic V6 engine had more than enough power for driving around the busy DC streets, avoiding bad drivers.  Though it felt more like drivers were avoiding me -- a very nice feeling!  Nice pickup, smooth engine, not too noisy. 

The Interior: The factory stereo is great.  I got the 12 disc CD changer, which was very very good.  Barely ever skipped.  Headroom was more than adequate, and the back seat (with the front seat back all the way) was the largest and most spacious I've ever been in.  The back seats folded down (60/40) to reveal useful plastic cupholder and workspace (fold down one so you can sit in the first and use the back of the second).  Both back seats folded up and against the back of the front seats to make almost enough room for a full length couch (about 6 feet by 4 feet).  The fabric seats were comfortable, and the floor carpets were fine.  

Interior Cons: The rear carpeting is a little cheap, and I found out that there isn't a whole lot to control liquid spills in the rear (after a gallon of apple juice exploded back there).  The plastic side panels scratch fairly easily, and I don't know how I did it, but the leather/vinyl covering on the door panel ripped, but probably because I shoved a couch in too hard.  The rubber that insulated the emergency brake ripped after the first few weeks of ownership.

The Exterior: There is a little section (about 4 inches high) near the bottom of the side panel that is not the same material as the rest of the vehicle.  It was a little difficult to clean, and after a while looked slightly different than the rest of the SUV.  The bumpers SUCK!  I was driving away and knocked a steel bumper of a car at about 5 miles per hour -- and did $650 worth of damage!  Terrible.

Overall: I'd get another Trooper.  I love the ride, I love the looks, and I love the functionality.  And I got it in October of 1996 for $289 a month with $2500 down (3 year lease). Things I'd change? Make a scratch resistant plastic protection for the doors and the rear section; fix the rubber insulation on the emergency brake; change the bumpers to steel, or plastic-covered steel. <br><br>
