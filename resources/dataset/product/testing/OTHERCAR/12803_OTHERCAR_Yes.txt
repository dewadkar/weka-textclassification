            I have been putting off buying a digital camera for a while, waiting for prices to come down.  Sure, you can pick one up for a hundred bucks or so, but it'll usually be garbage.  I got this 3.3 megapixel camera from Amazon for $400 dollars.  Amazon even threw in an extra 32 MB compact flash memory card and carrying case.  A friend of mine already had the camera (he bought it when it first came out and was selling for nearly twice the price) so I knew what to expect.  

Cool features:
-High resolution, pictures printed out on a decent color printer are indistinguishable from 35mm photos.
-Has a video-out cable to plug into your vcr/tv allowing you to video tape or watch a scene as if it were a camcorder.
-Easy card and battery loading.
-The ability to turn off the digital zoom.  Although it has a mechanical zoom and digital zoom, many people, including me, dislike digital zoom because it reduces picture quality.
A multi-picture taking mode that allows you to take several pictures of a scene and blend them all together in one big picture.  This is great, and works surprisingly well.  
-Small size, can fit in your pocket.

Negatives:
-Eats batteries.  This really should have come with a rechargeable battery kit.  If you use the lcd screen, expect a battery to last for maybe 50 to 60 shots.  I bought the recharge kit for $100, which comes with a rechargeable battery, a base, and a special converter allowing the camera to use the AC power directly.
-Some people have complained that flesh tones turn out a bit faded.  I found that as long as long as I performed the white balance before my shots, everything looked fine.
-No audio recording.  This would have been nice in conjunction with the video-out mode.


I don't know if Amazon still has the promotion going on, but even for a few bucks more, this camera is a bargain when compared to comparable models.  Be sure to buy the rechargeable battery kit, it will pay for itself.
