            I have been doing some research on the Chrysler LH cars (Concorde, LHS, 300M, and Dodge Intrepid). I have found that the three Chrysler versions are very, very similar. I have some books from auto shows about these cars. Actually the LHS and 300M are almost the exact same cars. The suspension of the 300M is stiffer, giving it a sportier ride. And the front and rear ends are different. But most of the car, is EXACTLY the same. In their catalog, the interiors shown for these two cars are almost identical. I can count the differences on one hand. (1)The leather is different colors. (2) The 300M has the autostick system (automatic stick shift). (3) The 300M has rear headrests. Other than that, I don't see many differences. The radio and climate controls are in the same place and there is the same wood trim above them. The speedometer, tachometer, etc. and the exact same clock is in the same place.  In fact, these two cars come with the same equipment; except the 300M has an optional spoiler. The prices are almost the same, with the 300M being a little more money. But, the LHS is about 10 inches longer (the 300M is being sold in Europe and cars are smaller there). The engines are the same, and they have the same horsepower and torque. I doubt many people know all of this, since the fronts and rears of these cars are totally different. If you are looking at one of these cars, theres no reason to not look at the other. The LHS appeals to older drivers, while the 300M is a competitor to the imports. 

Personally, I think that all of these cars have very weird designing, and they look like spaceships. But, they are not ugly. I just can't understand why Chrysler would sell both of these cars, and the Concorde. The 300M is considered a sports car, when the LHS and Concorde aren't. I don't really see much of a difference in them, just think they are good cars that have very revolutionary styling. 

My advice is to look at the Dodge Intrepid. It has the most conservative styling of the group, and its very inexpensive compared to the others. The Chrysler versions (Concorde, LHS, 300M) are all really vintage, and the Dodge is a basic family car. The base engine is a 2.7 liter V6 with 200 horsepower. That is enough horsepower. The R/T version has the 3.5 liter found in the 300M, but this engine is very powerful. I am a little weary of the reliability, because this engine is working hard to put 253 horses out. 

But, these cars are so similar, its a good idea to look at all of them before you decide to buy one. Most of the components are the same, so its the price and looks really play a big role in your choice. <br><br>
