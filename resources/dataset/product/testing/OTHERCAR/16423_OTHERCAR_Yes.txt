            I got this camera as a wedding gift from my lovely wife. She let me choose it and I picked this one for the price and features, and she said it was "cute." It was a priority for me to have a camera with a rechargeable battery. Other cameras eat up those AA batts. 

I began using this camera just a few hours after I bought it. The battery only took a couple hours to charge. I have used it for my rehearsal dinner, wedding and honeymoon, and another friend's wedding. The picture quality is crystal clear. The camera features many "modes" such as backlit, party (indoor), sand/snow (bright sun" and portrait. There is a mode for every situation. It of course has a red-eye reduction feature. It also has a zoom lens and a viewing screen for "instant developing" after you take the pic. In playback mode you can see all the pics you have taken and delete them if you don't like them. It also makes short JPEG movies without sound. The only thing missing to me is a panoramic feature. 

It comes with software for uploading pics to your computer, a USB cable, a battery, recharging station, and an 8MB memory card. I bought an additional 128MB card when I bought the camera. At best quality, the 128MB card holds about 120 pics - equal to 5 rolls of 24 exposure film. I found a place to upload the pics online and print them for $.25/pic so the developing isn't much more than normal.  

UPDATE - 9/5/02  After owning the camera for just over 9 months, I have decided that it's not all that great. It does take sharp pictures and I still cosider it a good buy for an entry level digital camera. It can take such a LONG time to record the picture to the disk and it won't let you shoot another picture or even change the focus mode while it's recording. I have decided to move up to a more ambitions Nikon SLR to pursue photography as a hobby and the CoolPix 775 isn't functional enough for me. I lover my review to 3 stars.
