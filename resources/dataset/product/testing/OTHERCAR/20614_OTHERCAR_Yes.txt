            I am very pleased with my recent purchase on a 2000 Audi A4.  The car drives like a dream.  It handles great, accelerates when you need it, and is very comfortable.  

I drive my car to a ski cabin in Tahoe on weekends and it is better in the snow than the Ford Explorer and Dodge Dakota Sport.  The car rides over the pass like its not even there.  While the others are crawling I fly past them. 

I drove all the 4 wheel drive sedans and wagons priced below $40,000 before choosing the A4. I liked its overall driving quality, acceleration, and styling the best. I settled for the non sport suspension. If I had to do it over I'd add the stiffer suspension and buy a extra set of rims and snow tires. The heated seats are such a bonus on those wet cold days just off the mountain. 

I love the bose premium sound system.
