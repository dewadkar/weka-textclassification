            Blow head gaskets at about 70,000 miles, just about the time I received the letter from the manufacturer extending the basic warranty for the cooling system to 100,000 miles.  About a week before the head gasket blew, the water pump started leaking.  I had the water pump replaced on my own, and had the dealer replace the head gasket.  It took two visits to the dealer to get them to do the work.  
Around 134,000 miles the water pump started leaking again, and a week later the head gasket blew for the second time.  This time I was going to have the head planed, and a valve job done, but found out the head is cracked, so I need a whole new head.  This is a very expensive repair job.  I am also wondering how much further damage has been done to other parts of the cooling system and engine, such as piston rings, the heater core, and the radiator.  It has to do with having an iron block and an aluminum head, and the manufacturer using buyers to test out the design and find out that it's poor.  This particular engine was a 2.2 liter L4.  I bought the car because I was in the Navy and wanted my wife to have a reliable vehicle with good gas mileage.
