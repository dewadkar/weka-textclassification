            We bought a 1995 Toyota Camry last August for my daughter. This has been a very safe and economical car for her to drive.  Not only was it the &quot;car of her dreams,&quot; because it had a sun roof, CD player, and bucket seats, but it had a back seat that opened so that she could put packages in and out of the trunk without getting wet when it rained!

Two weeks ago, my daughter was returning home from her job after dark (also on damp pavement) when a COW stepped out of the ditch onto the road in front of her.  Her quick reactions and this car kept her from having a wreck!  She swerved to get around the calf (left and then right back onto the road) and could have gone into the ditch because the edge of the road had a drop in elevation where the pavement ended and essentially no shoulder. The Toyota Camry held its ground, and she maneuvered the car back onto the road without any mishap at all!  

Thank you, thank you, thank you, for keeping my Senior safe. I cannot tell you how stable and well made this car is.  We sold her Chevy Blazer, because we felt it was &quot;top heavy.&quot;  Believe me, if this would have occurred with the Blazer, she would have flipped into the ditch.  I had read documentation about the construction of the Toyota, which was one of the reasons we bought the Toyota Camry, but now I am a witness to the stability and handling of this car.  In the past, there have been several major and sometimes fatal accidents involving classmates in similar situations, in other cars.  I am so glad we made the right decision.

We have another daughter who will be 16 in June.  You'd better believe we will go back to our Toyota dealer!<br><br>
