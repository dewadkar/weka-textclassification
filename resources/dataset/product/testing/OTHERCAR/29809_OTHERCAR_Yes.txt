            Here's a little black box that offers much to the consumer.  I researched the internet and electronic stores on various Digital Cameras.  What I was looking for was something that would give me the feel of 35 mm photography. I am a semi - professional photographer and love to manipulate my photo shots.  This camera gave me enough manual options and clarity just right for what I needed it for.  It even has the feel and look  of a 35mm camera. A bonus to me is the Kodak web site full of tips and great support for kodak Digital cameras.  I felt very comfortable that I would receive plenty of support. It took awhile of getting use to the camera, perhaps its worst feature was in handling it, it sometimes felt too smooth and would begin to slip out of my hands. Also missing was threads on the lens for filters to enhance my photos.  But for what I needed it worked!  I wanted to use my pet dog in an advertisement which would mean lots of rolls of film to just get a few good photos for newspaper advertisements and silk screen shirts.  So the DC 260 helped accomplished my goals as well as other uses. Bottom line:  I am very happy and pleased with the DC 260.<br><br>
