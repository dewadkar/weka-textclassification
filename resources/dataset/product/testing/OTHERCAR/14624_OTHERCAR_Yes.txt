            In the market for a used Volvo S70 because of the reputation for safety, we test drove new models and found that the local dealer could offer a lease package that made buying used unnecessary. We love the ride which is slightly stiff and yet comfortable. The solid ride makes it an easier car for highway in windy conditions that our other &quot;luxury&quot; car which is the old full size American concept. Road sounds are nicely isolated and the music package is first rate. The heated leather seats are extremely comfortable.

Drawbacks include intermitent electrical problems evidenced by the speedometer and several other dash board indicators failing. This happened only about 6 times over the first 18 months and, like a desk top computer, were alleviated when we turned the car off and then back on for a &quot;reboot&quot; of the on board computer. In addition, the front passenger's seat is not electrically controled, a feature we did not notice until we too k delivery. These both are minor compared to the overall enjoyment we have experienced with the car. We definitely would purcahse or lease another.<br><br>
