            The Toyota Celica is amazing. The style, speed, and performance are incredible in this car. When you look at this car you may think it looks a little cramped on the inside but once you sit down inside of it and look around it is much bigger than most cars in its class. Compare it to other cars like mustangs or eclipses and the difference inside is incredible. The back seat of the celica is more than just a space to sit some luggage in like it is in the eclipse. You are actually able to move around in the back seat especially with Me being a pretty tall guy at 6'1&quot;. If you are much taller than me though I do not recommend trying to fit back there. Driving the celica is a blast. It handles like a go cart. You can turn on a dime in this car and you can accelerate quick and smoothly. Even though the celica is only a 4 cylinder engine it might just make you think its a v-6 or a v-8 with the way it can get up and go. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a car that is worth the money and will turn heads when you drive by. If you don't enjoy a car that goes fast and is a little small compared to other cars then i would not recommend it because I admit it is alittle small compared to most other cars.<br><br>
