            Not many vehicles look good with a little mud on the flaps but JEEP Cherokee manages to pull it off. If you can style in Georgia clay, that's saying something.

I never wash my car. Jeep just gets away with looking rugged. I choose the colour 'desert sand' for several reasons. First of all, it mixes very nicely with Georgia clay. Secondly, black is not a wise choice for Atlanta unless you have a personal mission to melt. Finally, it's an unusual colour. Who wants to be usual? Certainly not me.

If you are blessed with being tall, get thyself to a Jeep and quick. I have a friend, Duane N,  who is 6'8&quot;. Yes, you read that right. He's a big boy and he doesn't mind saying when he's uncomfortable. Now usually, Big D is condemned to riding in vehicles with his legs wrapped around his head. Wonderful if you are into commuter yoga, otherwise a serious drag. 

We road tripped on a comedy gig down to Tennessee. Now I was a little nervous that Big D wasn't going to groove on the Jeep. There is nothing worse than a grouchy giant. I shouldn't have given it another thought. Big D gets in my Jeep and he was lounged. Stretched out. Stylin. Not a word of criticism, no aches and no pains. We arrived with a zen attitude and rocked the house. Thank you Jeep.
