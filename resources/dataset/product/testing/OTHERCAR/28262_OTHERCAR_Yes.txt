            I am eighteen years old and I received a Durango as a Christmas gift last year. I haven't had one problem with it yet and I absolutely love it. I have driven other suv's and trucks and none ride with the comfort of a Durango. It drives like a car but performs like a truck.

I have had it in some pretty nasty mud and you just can't get this thing stuck. This vehicle is loaded with options and is a good choice for many types of people. I think it is great for young people like me, and the infinity stereo system is awesome. 

I chose not to get the third row of seats, but this would be a good feature for someone with a large family. If you don't get the third row of seats you get some handy little compartments under the floor. I found this very useful to keep my vehicle clutter free. 

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the power that these engines pump out. They aren't the greatest on gas but you have all the acceleration that you want. I give this car the thumbs up!
