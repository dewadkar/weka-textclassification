            I live in Seoul, South Korea. This means many things, very few pertinent to this review I admit but many things none the less. It means that, yes, I have drunkenly bought the same puppy from the same street vendor three times, it means that I have despaired for America every time I�ve walked along Itaewan and yes I have become immune to the smells, the sights and the variety that makes this city great. I have become local. I take buses when I can, walk when its feasible and drive only when 100% necessary. 

Driving in Seoul is unlike driving anywhere else. For a start there are no rules other than a strangely Darwinian version of the alpha driver making it to the crossing whilst the others fail. Seoul is congested. It�s also dangerous. Roadside banners tick as you wait in traffic marking off the hourly accidents vs. the hourly fatalities in shades of green and red. 15 million people going about their business on roads built for far fewer makes for an interesting experience. In Seoul you don�t buy a car for driving pleasure you buy a capsule for survival. That�s why I used to drive a Korando, a car as horrible as its name. High, heavy and wrapped in chrome bull bars guaranteed to kill a pedestrian upon collision at any speed it muscled its way through traffic. Frightening the owners of gleaming Dynasties, Grandeurs and Sonatas. Cars in Korea are Korean � choice is fine in theory but when it comes down to it its Korean or nothing. So the Korando was well equipped in the muscle department but lacked something in finesse. I was spending up to four hours a day in what felt like a tank. Time to change.

So what did I need? I needed big enough to scare other drivers enough to let me into lane. I needed high enough to see over rest of the traffic for gaps, nippy enough to surge through for gaps and comfortable enough to make my journeys across town more pleasure than chore. Oh and I wanted sexy. In Europe I�d driven sports cars, nifty two seater numbers with rev counters that flew clockwise as the urgency of the exhaust note became higher, more distinct.

The Hyundai Santa Fe LX fitted all but the sexy brief. A shiftronic it allowed me to feel as though I was still in control but freed me of a million left foot aerobic exercises as clutch was engaged and realised in the slow crawl of rush hour traffic. Scuff plates allowed me not only to intimidate but actually hit other drivers in a bid to make progress and my how this has changed my life. No longer do I just look menacing, I am menacing. One suicidal lunge into traffic, one minor dent to a dusty Daewoo and suddenly I�m queen of the road, panicky men making enough room for the mad ultra vixen to get through without damage to their pride and joys.

Inside the car is built for comfort rather than for driver pleasure. The big leather seats feel almost like armchairs as you sink into them. Anywhere else in the world and they�d be too soft but at 4mph they feel good, calming me just enough to save murder. They may be a variation of beige but they�re durable and functional. There are lots of places to store sunglasses, coins, maps, CDs, make-up, bags and insurance details too. It�s a walk-in wardrobe of a car, a positive gateway to Narnia on stilts. A room with a commanding view.

Climate control is excellent � a must in a country that can go from 40C to �20C summer to winter and there are some nice Saab-like touches to be found � heated mirrors for example. The car can take quite a while to fully de-mist on a very cold morning but them it is huge and there is a lot of glass to be cleared. Remote central locking and even auto engine start / light on are standard on the car � great for those scary trips �alone� across the floor of a creepy multi-storey parking lot. Valet is rare here and collecting the car is frightening � this is one security feature that I like.

Driving is simple if workmanlike. The car responds well in traffic and has plenty of urge low down. Out of town there�s cruise control but again the car wants to anaesthetise rather than involve. It�s just a little woolly, a little removed from the conditions. Whilst ABS, traction control and a good 4WD system mean that this isn�t a problem safety-wise it does mean that you can end up feeling just a little over-protected.

To sum up this isn�t a car I�d have bought anywhere other than here. I like my cars to be the opposite of my men, small and fast. This is big, predictable, safe and comfortable. The kind of husband who you see with girlfriends who always needed to �settle down�. The kind of man you envy her for but wouldn�t want for yourself, just yet. The Hyundai Santa Fe is not an SUV that will thrill but it will do the job and when you spend as much time in traffic as I do currently that�s just fine. Recommend it? Only to those with a city drive and no easy alternative.
