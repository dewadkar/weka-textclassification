            I bought this camera about seven months ago after doing extensive on-line research.  It works great for me and my family.  This camera is extremely easy to use.  

The Olympus D-360L has great options that aren't usually available on a camera at this price.  I was able to adjust the shutter speed and flash to take some beautiful moonlight and fireworks pictures this summer.  

In doing my research, battery life was a big concern.  I purchased 2 sets of rechargeable batteries to use alternately in the camera, and I have never had a problem with running out of power.  I haven't used my 35mm camera since this one arrived.<br><br>
