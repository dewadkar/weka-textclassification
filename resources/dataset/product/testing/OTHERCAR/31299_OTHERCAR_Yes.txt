            I have always wanted a Volvo wagon and now that I have one, I can say this car is far superior to my Accord wagon (well the Honda was 6 years older) in almost every way. It's opulent, rich and loaded. My 93 Honda never felt this smooth and quiet while traveling over all the same road surfaces. It's a heavy car, but doesn't lean in turns as much as the Honda. The fuel consumption is a little higher, but worth it in my mind. If I had known the v70 (which looks much like the 850 it replaced) was this fresh and new inside and was this comfortable and affordable, I would have sought one out last year when we were looking for a car to replace a 1985 Honda. While the 850 was good looking outside, the interior was too square and flat and impersonal. By comparison, this revision is much more pleasing. The controls in the 70 series are easy to recognize and work well. The power seats with memory are the nicest part of sharing this car with my wife! The car needs a little more low end kick and it would be phenomenal. I guess that's what the t5 and glt models are for. Volvo is known well for safety and you know it the instant you fire it up and take off. This thing is a tank dressed in leather and nice shiny paint! Even after nearly 80 thousand miles, four years and three owners, this car's looks still hold. The paint has high clarity and the leather interior is of thick, soft, high quality material. Note: If buying used, take special care to make sure the car has lived its life free of major damage. Having this car in original factory form (from Sweden) is the key to a quality car & driver relationship. Go for one!!
