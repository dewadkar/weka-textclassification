            The MA70 Toyota Supra is a fantastic car, just like it's next generation, the MKiV, which debuted in late 1993.  The MA70 looks fine, drives, fine, and is quite practical.  But when the turbo comes on, hold on tight!  You're pushed back into your seat as you fly down the interstate!  With the automatic, you have greater acceleration, but with the manual there is more joy in driving this great GT car.  The back seat is tiny, so it is best reserved for kids under 14.  The front is alright though, it offers good leg room.  This would be an excellent first car for your teenager or a good extra car.  It's the best of both worlds: reliable and fast.<br><br>
