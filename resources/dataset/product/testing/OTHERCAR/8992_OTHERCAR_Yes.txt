              I bought this vehicle merely because I had the 1990 version. The difference is the interior and I got a four door this time. The car is much better then my old one. The interior is incredible and the car has not given me one bit of trouble since I have purchased it a few months ago. 
The ride is so smooth I could sleep like a baby for hours in it and the added sun roof helps extra fresh air enter the car when needed.
The only downfall of this car is that it is not roomy. I am 5 &quot;10 and am 180lbs and when I sit in the back my head hits the ceiling and in the front the same happens so I urge everyone over 6 feet to step away from this car. It wasn't made for taller men and women.


Pros:� interior design is excellent, can put a baby to sleep inside
Cons:� not made for people over 6 feet tall<br><br>
