            I own a 1999 Saab 9-3 5-door.  This review is based on the 2002 9-3 SE loaner my dealer gave me for a few days while my car was being serviced.

My 1999 9-3 is an outstanding car.  It now has 37,000 miles on it, and apart from some minor front end problems my dealer has been working on, the car has been a real workhorse - ultra-reliable, awesome ride, great on gas, roomy (until we had a child!), with plenty of storage space in the back.  All of these benefits carry over to the 2002 model.

The 2002 version is better even though the cars look the same - NOTICEABLY better.  The 2002 version has a much tighter ride and feels glued to the road, and is simply a joy to drive.  This likely due to the addition of stability assist, which does an awesome job.  

By comparison, I also drove a 2002 9-5 2.3t, and it didn't feel as tight and quiet as the 9-3, very odd.

The ride quality is where the 9-3 really shines.  This is a car the begs to be driven, is fun on short trips, and very relaxing on long trips - some of the very best seats and visibility of any car on the road under $50K, no really! 

In spite of my 6'2" frame, I have never gotten out of the 9-3 with any stiffness in my back or legs, nor have I ever felt cramped in the car - it's that good.

Now the best part - the price.  GM is dealing on Saabs like crazy to boost market share.  Forget the list prices you're seeing, this car can easily be had for $400-500 over dealer invoice, and the lease rates are almost absurd.  

We leased our car at an amazing 1.9% interest rate, and then were able to buy it out for $4,000 under whatwe agreed to when we signed the lease.  In essence, after three years we acquired a $32,000 car for a total lease and buyout of around $26,000 - amazing.

While some would see the price depreciation as a negative, you get a TON of car for your money, and these cars are designed to last.  Three year depreciation is probably worse than most cars in the class, but then it levels out nicely and your car will hold its value steady for another 6-10 YEARS.  Note all of the 10-15 year old Saabs still on the road today.

Final note.  This car is getting a complete overhaul for 2003/2004.  The hatchback will be gone, but full time 4WD ala the Passat 4Motion will be added as standard.  The new model will also be wider and longer than the current 9-3, and offer a more powerful engine.  Is it worth waiting for the new model line?  Or should one grab a great deal on the 2002?  A very difficult decision!
