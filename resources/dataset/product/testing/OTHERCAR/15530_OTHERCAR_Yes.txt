            My middle aged crisis occurred when I rented a Sebring while on a business trip.  After two days of tooling around in the mountains of New Mexico I knew I needed this car for my own.
Of all of the convertibles that I looked at the Sebring had the most value for the money and looked the best.  It also could be used as a family car because of the adequate rear seat room.
My version is the top of the line; v-6 engine, two tone leather interior, white instrumentation, special wheels, driving lamps, and the &quot;autostick&quot; transmission. The price is high but very competitive with other convertibles.  The Mustang is about the same and the BMW is much more.
The autostick transmission allows you to drive in full automatic or shift like a four-speed.  This combined with the V-6 engine makes driving fun even while in traffic on the interstates.<br><br>
