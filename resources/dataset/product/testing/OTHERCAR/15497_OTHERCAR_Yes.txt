            I am a Power Seller on ebaY.  I started in August of 1999.  My first purchase for my new venture was the Sony Mavica FD-88.  I spent 2 weeks on the internet hunting down the best price and the best camera.  

This camera can take a close up of a diamond ring or take a pic of a sunset.  The ease of the disk versus a flash card is the best feature for an internet seller like me.

User friendly is not the word I would use.  Moron friendly is more like it.  I never read the directions, but was able to figure out in a few minutes what I needed to do to put up pictures on ebaY.  There are several photo sizes to choose from and one was perfect for ebaY.  No cropping needed, just point, shoot, and post.

For extended picture taking, I do recommend a longer life battery.  

This camera is a winner for those of you interested in posting pictures on the internet either for business or pleasure.<br><br>
