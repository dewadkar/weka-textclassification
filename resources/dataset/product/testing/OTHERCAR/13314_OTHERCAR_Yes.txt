            I am not a technical reviewer, so please know that this review is written from the "dumb consumer" point of view.  I've owned several Subarus in the past, and have been fairly impressed by each one.  We live in the frozen Northeast (this year it's frozen -- last year it was the Sahara) and rely on strong, all-wheel-drive cars to get us to work when the weather turns bad.  I personally live at the bottom of a pretty steep slope, cleverly landscaped with a huge boulder just off to the side.  It's been an accident waiting to happen for the past 25 years, but so far only our visitors have met the rock face-to-face.

We bought the Forester S in 2001 (2002 model), and were unreasonably taken with it's styling.  It's a fairly well-built small SUV.  To wit, the breakdown as I see it:

Pros:
We got the all-leather, 6-CD changer, just-short-of-the-best model.  So far as driving goes, it handles well, and does not feel like a truck through turns.  It is responsive, has strong brakes, quick acceleration, and is comfortable at high speeds.  For an SUV, the gas mileage is not terrible (about 23 miles per gallon).  The sound system is competent, with the standard stereo speakers in front and back.  The operation of the radio is a little awkward, since it is just too far away for normal arms (gorillas would find it reachable).  The cruise control is easily accessed, as are most of the remaining features (automatic mirror adjusters, lights, seat controls...).  The trunk is quite large and easily accessed, and comes with a cargo cover to keep your goodies private.  The ride gets a little noisy, as it appears Subaru is not too concerned with a quiet ride.  Wind and traffic noise tend to seep in.  It appears we are to segue into...

Cons:
First, the minor cons.  The noise volume is a touch high.  It takes $20 to fill up every 300 miles.  Short, disabled, or elderly people need a forklift to get into the seats.  Ah, the seats!  Don't you think an "SUV," regardless of the size, should have leg room?  At least for the driver?  I'm a little over 6 feet tall, and I am NOT comfortable in this driving space.  What's that noise?  Kind of a muffled, pathetic little "help me" sound?  Oh, it's the passenger sitting behind me.  His knees are embedded in his chest and his lungs are somewhat compressed.  I'm kind of curious how he even got into the car in the first place!  The rear seat is perfectly sized for those with dwarfism or truncated limbs.  Again I have to wonder why I didn't notice this prior to signing the contract.

The selling point of the Subaru is it's traction-control, full-time all-wheel-drive.  On this point, I'm split.  Remember that driveway that climbs toward the sky?  The car almost always takes it in stride and doesn't even hiccup (my plow guy got stuck on the side of my driveway during our last storm.  The plow.  He drives a plow).  So far so good.  But it does not always hold up.  I fish-tailed going about 15 mph turning onto an on-ramp, slid sideways going down my driveway later that night, and don't always feel as though I've got a firm grip of the road.  Now, I understand that this isn't a miracle car, and that driving on ice is not perfect.  I just thought that it would be a little more reliable than this (hence my longing for my old sled, as the title indicates).

So, the comfort is absent, the snow reliability is flawed, and it's a little noisy.  At least it's affordable, right?  Um... no.  This one set me back about $28,000.  I know that's not luxury-priced, but it's still a little high to have these issues.  What am I trying to say?  I'm not sure.  Even though I've got these concerns with the car, I still like it.  I don't know why, but I just do.  My advice is to buy with caution.  Test the back seat and see if your passengers can survive the ride.  Test it in snow and ice if at all possible to see how it handles.  I'm still more confident in this car in winter than I'd be in a Kia; I still think it looks spiffy; I still like the features and the quasi-confidence in winter weather.  Caveat emptor -- buyer beware.
