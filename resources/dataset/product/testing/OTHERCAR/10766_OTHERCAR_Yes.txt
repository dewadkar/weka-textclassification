            As a Cadillac owner for over 40 years I am a discriminating buyer. At the moment there are two '91  Cadillac Sedan DeVilles presently owned and driven daily in the family. Although my preference is a Coupe (pictured) the Sedans do quite well, the performance and interior ambiance serve me well. 
 As with most luxury cars like Cadillacs come with all the bells and whistles, and in our case  they all work, even at an advanced age with over 90,000 miles on both of them, each car has been repainted once, and both look remarkably well, with comments such as &quot;what year is it&quot;.
 Mechanically 91's inherently have  water pump problems, slight oil leakage at oil pan (can be corrected at moderate cost), and brake master cylinder problems related to the anti-lock system. None of these problems  cost a great deal to service unless you go to a dealer. The other item that we have replaced on one Cadillac DeVille is retrofitting the AC to the new 134A refrigerant, this runs several hundred dollars, but modernizes the vehicle, if original AC fails retrofit is a mist.
 All in all the 91 is a presentable automobile with good road mileage and a bit to be desired in city mileage. <br><br>
