            The Olympus C-3000 Zoom is an excellent high-end digital camera.  Coming in at $799 (USD), this camera is expensive but loaded with features.

The 3.3 Megapixel camera has 3X optical zoom combined with 2.5X digital zoom for an approx. 7.5X zoom photograph.

This &quot;camedia&quot; as Olympus calls it also can take sound and video shots up to 120 seconds in quality mode with a 16MB memory card.

USB and TV connections come with the camera, as well as a 8 MB Flash memory card.

Picture quality is exceptional.  Resolution choices are also a very nice feature.  TIFF images can go from 2048x1536 to 640x480 with three options in between.  JPEG resolution goes from 1600x1200 to 640x480 with two options in between.  

Picture storage with the provided 8 MB is average.  Normal 1024x768 recording mode gets you 37 images without sound, 32 with.

However storage performance drops off considerably with higher resolution.  Bottom line, if you are going to spend this kind of money on such a great camera, don't hold yourself back because of an extra $50 memory card.  At least buy an additional 16MB card for long picture taking days.

Speaking of long picture days, battery life is above average for the number of &quot;old fashioned&quot; camera options that are available with this digital camera.  Lithium batteries are provided and I highly recommend buying the AC adapter.  You will make money on it in the long run.

I've mentioned video and sound capabilities but what made me buy this camera was the flexibility of set up that you get with this camera.  There is an automatic mode, but I'm a big fan of the manual aperture, shutter and focus settings that really take advantage of the camera's high end resolution.  Four flash modes (auto, fill-in, red-eye and none) also help with picture options and five setting options (indoors, outdoors, etc. make this camera work for both novices and pros.

Macro mode for pictures up to 8&quot; is standard and spot metering options works well in indoor conditions.  The timer and remote control will come in handy for family picture time and four ISO (Auto, 100, 200 and 400)settings are nice features for active settings (e.g., baseball games, tennis matches...etc).  Flash correction is also a nice feature.  Like most digital cameras I've used, the flash in auto is much too aggressive, so this is a nice feature once you get a feel for the camera.

Panorama mode is clumsy at first, but nice once you get the hang of it and the picture editing software is decent for provided with camera software.

The Bottom Line for the Olympus C-3000 Zoom is if you are looking for a high-end 3.3 megapixel digital camera, this model should be your next purchase.  Options and flexibility are stellar and the photo resolution is second to none.  This camera has no competitors in the $600-$850 price range.<br><br>
