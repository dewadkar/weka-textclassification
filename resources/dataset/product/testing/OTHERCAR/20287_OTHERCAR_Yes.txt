            My first non-junker vehicle was a base model '94 Sentra.  Not much in the way of frills, but the fact that it started through the winter without a hitch and has turned over 130K miles with few mechanical problems has certainly impressed me.

A year ago I bought a new '98 Sentra GXE.  It has more toys to play with (power locks and windows, etc) and more pop in the accelerator than the 1994 model, but the same excellent mileage and dependability I count on my older car to still provide as my family's second car.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone willing to trade a certain amount of power and roominess--my 6'3&quot; brother in law has no problem in the passenger seat, but is not comfortable at all in the back--for dependability and efficiency.  The XE, GXE and LE models offer varying degrees of creature comforts for a reasonable increase in price, which adds some flexibility to the line it didn't have a few years ago.  Nissan has certainly found a niche with this model and is doing a fine job meeting the needs of their target audience.<br><br>
