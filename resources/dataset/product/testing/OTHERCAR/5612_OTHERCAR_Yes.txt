            The Saab 900 is an automatic classic. There's never been anything quite like it, and Saab, to their detriment, don't build cars with this sort of character any more.

But you want to be careful about cars with 'character'. Italian cars with character rust and need their clutches changes every 3000 miles. German cars with character require you to mortgage your house to repair them. French cars with character require you to mortgage your wife along with the house. But I am starting to tell you a little bit too much about my life here!

There are a wide range of Saab models of this vintage and they differ around the world. In general you get the following combos:

* bodies may be 2 door saloon, 4 door saloon, 2 or 4 door hatchbacks, or the stunning Aero 2 door hatch

* engines may be 2L 8 valve EFI, 2L 16 valve EFI, 2L 8 valve turbo EFI, 2L 16 valve turbo EFI with intercooler. There may also be a few models about which are not EFI (that's electronic fuel injection) but carburetted.

The 900 I own is a 1986 EMS, naturally aspirated. This means 2L 16 valve, no turbo. It's a rare 2-door model, with boot, but no hatch, but it does have folding rear seats like a hatchback. The EMS in Australia has a slightly tighter more sporting suspension than the 900i--more like the turbo Aeros, but without the turbo.

Overall, the acceleration and cruising are a little better than the equivalent 8-valve engines, but the 3 speed auto does make real performance a little academic. This car goes okay when wound out a bit, but the acceleration from low revs is mediocre. You won't be winning any traffic light Grands Prix here.

On the other hand, the turbos of this vintage go pretty well. again, low rev acceleration is poor, but when the turbo kicks in with its characteristic, slightly-too-long delay, the power surge is pretty impressive, and despite the slow start, it will still get you to 60mph in the low 8s.

The downside of the turbos is often reliability and cost of repairs. Don't go in unwarned, and make sure a real Saab expert checks out the car before you buy. If you get a good example, you'll love it, especially in the Aero body. A warning however--it was around about 1985/1986 that the newer turbos came on the market which had an intercooler. These are the ones to have. The pre-intercooler 900 turbos were crocks and to be avoided. In Australia, a lot of people seem to falsely advertise the year of their Saabs which causes confusion over whether they are pre- or post- intercooler models.

My Saab is extraordinarily comfortable. It has some of the best seats ever put in a car. The are like sporty lounge chairs and support you in all the right places. Saab used to advertise that their cars were recommended by orthopaedic surgeons! For a car of this vimtage the equipment levels are high, as they were usually specced for the luxury market. Electric windows, electric mirrors, air conditioning, decent stereo (if it's not stolen), power steer, split/folding seats, cruise control (which died), heated drivers seats, headlight wipers, etc.

The electric mirrors deserve special mention. There are separate left/right controls, and they are on little stalks (like cow's teats) on the dash where they can be operated with your fingers without taking your hands off the road. The best implementation in any car ever made, I think.

Also worthy of note is the air con/heater. It's not very intuitive, or very subtle, but it works splendidly, and the heater is amazing. Instant, gutsy heat. Just what you need for those cold Scandinavian winters. 

Another 'character' feature is the floor mounted ignition switch. This is a good security feature. It's almost impossible to hot-wire, which is good, because this car is very easy to break into. I once went to the office car park and found a thief sitting in my car. It's a cure story if ever we meet at a party. A friend of mine had his stereo stolen 5 times in 1 year in his 900 turbo!

My model also has a great manually operated sunroof. You just grab the handle and slide, and it will lock open in any position. Sure it has no tilt, or fancy electric openers, but it also has nothing that can go wrong, unlike my old BMW roof which jammed and had to be sealed up because the repairs would have cost more than the car.

On the other downside, the floor-mounted ignition means that dirt tends to get in and make it hard to start. I have heard of the switches failing completely, so I am particularly careful to keep dirt away from mine.

So what's it like to drive? Performance I have mentioned. Handling is remarkably good for a front drive car. It goes quickly around corners with initial understeer turning into mild oversteer at the limit. The suspension absorbs shock well, but still communicates a little road feel. The power steering is a little to soft and easy, but my partner who mostly drives this car appreciates that, especially when parking.

Power steering often leaks in these models. Mine has had a mild leak from new, but has never got any worse, and I just monitor it. When you feel it get a little heavier, you know the time has come to top up.

Other problems I have had include damage to the sump, which hangs a little low and tends to hit rocks on the road. Strange, considering the ground clearance is otherwise quite high. I&#146ve also had auto gearbox leaks which have cost me a bit. Overall the car has been quite reliable, but is fairly expensive to fix when it goes wrong.

If you own a Saab, or any other Euro car, get yourself a decent mechanic who specialises in that specific car. I cannot emphasis this too much. Pay more for servicing through and expert, and you will not regret it. Go cheap and you are guaranteed disaster.

For an old car, the Saab have a deserved reputation for safety. They are strong and built like brick dunnies (that&#146s an Australian outside toilet, for the uninitiated), and are apparently very good in crashes. That said, they will never compare to a good new car in this respect, as seat belt and crash performance has improved markedly in 16 years.

Another fantastic feature is the impact-absorbing bumpers, for which old Saabs are justifiedly famous. Hit something at 5 miles an hour or so, and those huge bumpers sink into the car, and gradually come out again over the next 20 minutes or so. They are great for car park skirmishes. Also, someone once rammed my car deliberately in an altercation, and there was no observable damage to the Saab whatsoever. There was a lot of damage to the other car however. That was great. The bad thing was that I actually owned both cars !

Overall, I love this car. It has oodles of style and character, and is still good looking to his day. It&#146s been safe and reliable and has so many inspired, unique touches that you can live with the lack of low down grunt. A true classic, but like all European cars, probably a car for the brave, or those who like a few challenges. If that&#146s not you, buy a Toyota.
