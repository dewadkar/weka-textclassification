            Let me first say that I don't own a new Discovery, but I've had the opportunity to drive one both on and off road, and I (in my D90) have been on several Rover 4-wheeling excursions with people in SII Discos.  I view that as ample qualification to write a (reasonably) unbiased review of the vehicle, but thought I should point it out to be fair.

The SII Disco is lightyears ahead of its predecessor (SI).  It feels significantly more stable both on and off the road.  I have no reservations whatsoever about recommending this vehicle to someone who's looking for a well constructed SUV that can deliver him a little further off the road than the average mall-wagon.  They also fixed the windscreen issue where tall people couldn't see &quot;up&quot; very well.

The rig's new traction control system is quite interesting.  Though driving it over loose ground requires that you break some habits you may have formed while wheeling in rigs without this system, I found that once I got used to it, it would get me through just about anything.  (The difference is that even when a wheel starts to slip, you never let off the gas to regain traction as you would without this feature.)

The sense of stability this vehicle projects (even with only 3 wheels on the ground :-) is impressive.  It makes driving over difficult terrain seem effortless.  My one complaint is that it felt &quot;big&quot; on the trail, but then I'm comparing it to a D90 which is smaller and lighter.  I'm sure that once I got used to it, it wouldn't be an issue.

I've also ridden extensively in a SII Disco on the road and found it to be comfortable, quite, stable, and well built.  I really like this truck.<br><br>
