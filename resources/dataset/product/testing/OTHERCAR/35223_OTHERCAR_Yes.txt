            I adore my 4 -Runner! I was in the market for a SUV, and test drove many different makes and models before deciding on the 4 -Runner, I am happy to say, I am glad that I made the decision that I did!
I have not had a single problem with this vehicle, it drives great, and it looks even better! It is very roomy, there is lots of space for luggage,etc in the rear of the vehicle, it is also very good on gas.
I have 4 small children, and it is very easy getting them in and out of car seats etc in this SUV.
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a great SUV.<br><br>
