            A have been a proud Toyota owner for over 15 years now.  My last two cars were Camrys.  Toyotas are reliable, comfortable and dependable cars.  

The Avalon drives like a luxury car.  It is very quiet on the road and handles very nicely in all types of weather.  The Avalon is not a sporty looking car, every much a sedan.  This car steers like a dream!  I don't know much about brakes, but this car brakes very well, even under wet and snowy conditions.

The front seats are quite comfortable and provide excellent back support for those long trips.  The rear seats are about the best you'll find in a car these days.  There is plenty of room in the back to seat three adults fairly comfortably for short trips, two adults for longer road trips.

I love the cup holders that are available in the front and the rear of the car.  No more spilled beverages in the car!  The Avalon is also equipped with map lights, making it easier to navigate from the passenger side in the evening.  

This car has an excellent heating and air conditioning system.  The passengers in the back will be comfortable, without discomfort to the front passengers.  

The Avalon has the biggest trunk I have ever seen.  Upon taking some friends to the airport, I was able to fit five suitcases in the trunk, and two carry on bags with room still left over.  

Toyota you out did yourself once again.<br><br>
