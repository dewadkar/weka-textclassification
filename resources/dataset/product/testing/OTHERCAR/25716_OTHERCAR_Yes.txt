            I've had my white '99 GLS New Beetle for 7 months now. I love the styling of the vehicle both inside and out. You should not buy this car if you do not like attention. Although it's been out for almost two years now, I still get many turned heads and people asking me about the car. My favorite feature of the interior is the very cool lighting. Interior lighting is in blue/purple and red. Performance wise, the NB leaves a bit to be desired. I would say what I like the least is the acceleration. It has decent passing power and I do just fine on hills, but as far as initial acceleration from a dead stop, forget about it. I've heard many owners describe their acceleration as &quot;peppy.&quot; I would disagree. Those owners probably have NBAD (New Beetle Affective Disorder). Of course, this complaint of mine is addressed with the new 1.8T New Beetle with 150hp. Functional wise, that is the only &quot;con&quot; I see with this car. With Volkswagon, there are many standard features. Naming a few are, ABS, Dual passenger and SIDE airbags, car alarm, etc... The first three service checks are free. They're at 5000, 10000, and 20000 miles. I average about 27mpg mixed driving. For those of you into modifying your cars, there are LOTS of styling and performance mods available. For myself, I've only added a spoiler and an all-around tint. Did wonders for my bug though. Like I said before, the car is an attention getter which is not always a good thing. Unfortunately I've been keyed twice already. I know of other owners that have had their cars spit on and keyed also. This has been given the name of New Beetle Backlash. It's an unfortunate thing that in today's society people would be so immature as to commit these acts under hate, jealousy, or whatever their reason is. These acts have had an affect on my enthusiasm for my car but I do not regret my choice in vehicles. One last bit of advice I can give you is in regards to dealers. When the New Beetle was first introduced, dealers demanded quite a premium above MSRP for the car. Things have died down by now but at least 70% of the dealers out there still think they can rip us off. Don't buy this car for a penny above MSRP! I know it depends on your geographical location, but call around. You will find a dealer that will sell it to you at MSRP. Isn't it worth going somewhere a couple of hundred miles away if you can save $3000? <br><br>
