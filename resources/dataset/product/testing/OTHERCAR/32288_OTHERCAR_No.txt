            Think back to 1992, 1993, when the Camry changed from a solid box-shaped car to the infamous bubble shaped one. Soon, everyone had one (usually in white, or black or emerald green) and it became one of the best selling cars in America. Why? Simply because it offered a lot for consumer money. The Camry boasts a smooth ride, space, reliability, a strong steel frame, American construction (I believe), and good power-steering. I've owned one myself for seven to eight years and I've had no serious problems with it, other than normal wear and tear. I compared the Camry with other similar cars, but I've found that none offer the quality car that Toyota has to offer. If you are a college student who doesn't wanna plop ten grand for one of those mini-cars or maybe if you are a concerned parent that wants to buy their kid a solid, starting-off type of vehicle, then test drive a Camry today. Like thousands of other Americans, I bet you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
