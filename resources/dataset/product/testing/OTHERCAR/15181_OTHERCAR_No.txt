            True my 1986 Toyota Van looks like a Space Shuttle on wheels, but I have put over 100,000 miles on it myself and love it, 95% of the time.  

These vans were hastily converted by Toyota in the mid 80's after Chrysler unveiled the Voyager mini-van line.  These were Tokyo delivery vans, at one time.  The engine cover is under the drivers' seat, the Power Steering access panel is behind the passenger seat, windshield washer fluid near the tailgate and so on...but it works!  I bought it used in 1988 for $10K and other than the dual AC, has not been too problematic.  I have given up (I think) on ever getting the AC cold, again.

I read somewhere that the van handles like a Ferarri and accelerates like a Corvette, but not at the same time!  Honestly, it doesn't handle too bad and pick-up is very strong for a very heavy metal box on wheels.  Traction on snow and ice is nada. Heavy front brake wear is offset by minimal rear brake wear.  Electric bugs are frequent in most of these vans (Brake fluid light comes on when the pads are just a touch old or the fluid just a hair low, but not low enough to add.  At least the fuel level light is right).

All and all I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone UNLESS you know what you have and how to treat it.<br><br>
