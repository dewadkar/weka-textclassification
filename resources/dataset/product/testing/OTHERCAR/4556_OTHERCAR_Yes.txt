            All of the models of the Supra are incredible cars. I have owned three, a 1984 (my first car), 1990, and 1992 turbo, all were purchased new. I traded the '84 in on the '92 when it had 145,000 miles and was offered twice the book value for the trade. I now have 120,000 miles on the '92 and don't plan to ever trade it. The ex-wife unfortunately totaled the '90. These cars are an absolute joy to drive, especially on long trips, since they are so comfortable and don't fatigue you. Speed and acceleration are hard to beat. 
The only negatives to these cars is room and repairs. Do not plan to use the back seats - use the minivan for hauling the kids. These cars are meant for the driver to enjoy. Repairs and routine maintenance for any Toyotas is quite expensive, but you will get a lot of miles out of a well maintained Supra. I would very highly recommend any model year of this car. Too bad Toyota priced themselves out of this part of the market.<br><br>
