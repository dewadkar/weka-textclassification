            The range rover is a great truck. I happen to own one, a 1992 of course, but its rugged, good in the sleet, snow, and other tough weather. Its also pretty under-priced for its qualities. Its 4-wheel capabilities by far pass the other trucks, like Ford Expedition and Lexus RX-500. The Range Rover also comes in many editions, such as limited w/ leather seats and fog lamps. Its a luxury car that blows away all the other SUVs in its class, and a good buy.
This car has very few negatives, but 1 would have to be the lack of space. The access cargo space in back takes away a few inches for leg room in the rear passenger seats. Still, there is still a lot of space to kick the back of your parents seats if you want.
The Range Rover is a smooth ride with great traction and steering capabilities. With its wide tires, its surprising that this car doesn't seem to flip over. In fact, this car has been proven very safe. With 4 stars in its crash test, this is a safe car and luxorious.<br><br>
