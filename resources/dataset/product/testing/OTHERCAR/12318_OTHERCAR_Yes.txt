            The 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse is truly a special car. No other car on the road shares its unique styling, performance, and luxury. Mitsubishi really did an outstanding job remodeling their five-year-old design. For one, the new model is much more stylish and looks amazing. But Mitsubishi didn�t only change the external appearance. They replace the old four cylinder, turbo charged engine with a bigger three liter two hundred horsepower engine, and added a tuned exhaust. All of the upgrades give the Eclipse the power to really fly down the road.

The Eclipse is a great car, but like almost every car, it isn�t perfect. A major problem for rear seat passengers is legroom. Mitsubishi made an effort to correct the problem since last year by adding two inches of room, but that�s just two inches more than nothing. Another common complaint about the Eclipse is that roof pillars block the driver�s rear view. This makes it hard to see what�s behind you and could ultimately become a safety concern.

All in all the Eclipse is a fine, fast sports car. Truly unique.
