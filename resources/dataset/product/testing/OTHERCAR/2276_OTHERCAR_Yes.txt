            I compared the Dodge Ram 1500, Silverado 1500HD, and Ford F150 Supercrew before finally deciding on this truck.  After 3 weeks I'm happy with the purchase but you really need to be sure this is what you want before jumping in at almost $28,000.

<b>The Ram 1500</b>
Many people are purchasing crew cab trucks because they like the styling and the 2003 crew cab Silverados are no different.  Ram's new styling in 2002 turned a lot of heads and I still think that truck has a more aesthetically pleasing exterior.  However, I felt the Ram was a little more than an extended cab with front hinged rear doors.  After the test drive we examined the back seat and it was cramped.  One of my primary considerations was the need to carry up to 4 adult passengers and there was no way to do that comfortably in the Dodge.  The other setback was the 5.9 L engine.  At 240 HP it felt a little underpowered.  With a towing load I felt this truck would be an under performer.  In all truth the engine is what kept me away from this truck.  I loved everything else, and when Dodge wakes up and offers the new Hemi in the half ton this truck will get serious attention for something other than its styling.

<b>Ford F150</b>
The Ford F150 is very popular, and maybe that is the reason I shied away from it.  It also felt like a much smaller truck behind the wheel, which for some people is a plus.  The back seat is smaller and the whole truck is much narrower, contributing to a ride the feels almost top heavy.  The engine is similar to that in the Ram but the gearing seems better.

<b>Silverado 1500HD</b>
The Silverado 1500HD is very hard to find on dealer lots and I was set to order one from the factory.  However, there really is little difference between the 1500HD and 2500HD.  They share the same frame, but the suspension on the 2500 is setup to handle more payload weight and towing capacity is greater.  The 1500 sits about an inch lower, but its only discernable when they are parked next to one another.

<b>Power train</b>
Hands down, the thing I love about this truck is the engine.  The Silverado has been best in class for payloads and towing capacity for a long time.  These are serious trucks, and you sacrifice some ride quality when they build the suspension to shoulder all that weight.  Fully loaded it drives beautifully.  On the daily commute expect to feel a few bumps and ripples.  Bridge expansion joints are to be avoided if possible.  I have set the cruise on 80 and it pulls up a 1/2 mile 5% grade without breaking a sweat.  There is an optional 8.1L v8 as well as the Duramax diesel, but this engine has plenty of power.  The obvious downside is fuel economy.  With a 26 gallon tank the truck has decent range, but for something that goes through gas at the rate of 11-15 MPG a bigger tank only makes sense.

This truck shines on the interstate.  Cruising at 80-85 there is little road or wind noise.  I expected passing in such a huge truck to be a chore (its almost 20 feet long), but the engine just pulls and pulls and keeps pulling for as long as your willing to watch the gas gauge plummet.  On a 40 mile stretch of two lane road we had no problem overtaking slower traffic at will.  I have yet to hear anyone complain that the 6L Vortec is underpowered for highway driving and moderate towing.

<b>Interior</b>
As already mentioned the interior far surpasses anything else out there for comfort and roominess.  If you are under 6 feet getting in and out is more of a chore than with the other trucks.  The interior trim and parts are typical GM.  The Dodge had a much more refined interior, but with some after market additions the Chevy can get pretty close (wood trim kit, custom floor mats, etc).  Another disappointment was the inch or so of give when you push the button to turn on the overhead map lights for the back seat.  The headliner moves way too much and doesn't feel solid.  Simply engineering a mounting point under the light cluster would have avoided this.  The back seat comes down to provide plenty of flat storage, but the seats and floor boards in back are so big I usually just leave them up (Enough room for a full size duffle bag, golf clubs, etc).

When I brought the truck home it had cloth seats.  I took it back a week later so the dealer could install after market leather.  If there's anyway possible, go with leather.  It makes getting into and out of this truck 100% easier.  The front seats are comfortable enough for long trips and so far no complaints from passengers in back after a couple of hours on the interstate.  I've had 5 adults in this truck with no problem.  With no center console the armrest folds up to reveal a pretty good size middle seat.  The drive shaft hump is low enough not to impede leg room too much if someone had to sit there, and the rear armrest with cup holders will be much appreciated by your passengers.

The biggest highlight of the interior is the cabin width.  In comparison with the other trucks I looked at the Chevy seemed a lot bigger.  Actual specs place it slightly smaller than the Ram and a little larger than the Ford.  In the Ram you don't notice the extra width because you give up so much leg room.  The front center armrest in the Chevy hides a massive storage compartment.  However, if you convert it to a third front seat everything including your pocket change just rattles around in there.  And if a curious rear seat passenger opens the lid it all ends up in the back floor board.

<b>Exterior and Styling</b>
Finally, the front end styling on the 2003 Chevy's mimics that of the Avalanche of the past couple of years so it's not new.  However, given the previously svelte looks of the Silverado bonnet the new more aggressive headlights definitely stand out.  One thing I noticed on the lot when walking around several of the 2500HD's was the poor fit of the fender flairs against the side body panels.  The doors seem to fit the bodyline much better than the full size doors on the F250 and F350 and the regular style handles are much easier to open.  It would make more sense to place the passenger grab handle on the A pillar than overhead where it's almost useless.  

This truck gets a lot of comments at gas stations and parking lots.  It is BIG and people notice it for that reason.  Afterwards they usually say, "Hey that's a really nice truck."  But it really stands out from the others under the hood.  If you buy it for styling, you'll be happy for a few years.  If you buy it for its power train and work capacity you'll be happy for a lot longer.
