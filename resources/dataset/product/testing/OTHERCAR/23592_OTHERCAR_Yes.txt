            You�ve heard of tough love? What we have here is tough luxury. Instead of some soft example of automotive mediocrity, the IS 300�s 24-valve in-line 6 delivers 215 horsepower immediately and forcefully. It is not just a sporty car; it is a full-blooded performance car, with all the requisite power and speed. At the same time, it�s sophisticated technologies grace the engine with the intrinsic quiet, dependability and congenial smoothness you�d expect of the a Lexus. In fact, the new IS 300�s engine is yet another case study in our Relentless Pursuit of Perfection. All moving parts and contacting surfaces were finessed to incredibly tight control parameters. From one end of the powertrain to the other, potential mechanical imperfections were weeded out with extreme diligence. So when you need to make demands on the Lexus IS 300 engine, it delivers power smoothly and quickly, from idle right on up to the redline.
