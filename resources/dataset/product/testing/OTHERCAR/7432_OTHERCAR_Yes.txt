            Overall Assessment
The car is comfortable and gets great gas mileage.  The safety features are unbelievable - there are 6 airbags and a whiplash protection system.  The engine is surprisingly good and has a great balance of gas mileage and power.  I traded-in a Mustang GT and was surprised to find I wasn't giving up as much power as I thought I would.  The warranty was 4 yrs/50k miles which is more than most cars in this class.

I got an S40 with most of the options - sunroof, leather, trip computer, automatic climate control, etc.  I viewed some S40's without all the perks and wasn't as impressed as when it was loaded up.  The trip computer is a cool toy but wasn't necessary for the price ($500 option).

I'm 6' 1", 250 lbs and I fit comfortably in the front seats but not the back - if you have kids or small passengers for the back seat, you'll be fine.

Possible Trouble Points (.... and I'm nit-picking to find them)
~ The A/C's air is not as cold as my '97 Dodge Stratus.
~ The ride is a bit stiff.
~ They should bump up the turbo pressure or add a six cylinder engine.  The engine is very peppy but needs a little more horsepower.
~ No standard transmission, an automatic is the only option but it's a 5-spd automatic and very smooth.

Dealership/Buying Experience
A great transaction.  I left within 3 hours having dealt with a trade-in, leasing paperwork and the price.  All the salespeople were professional and I never felt as though anyone was trying to screw me.  This was the easiest & fastest car purchase I have had to date.

As of June 2001, Volvo was running some sweet lease & finance deals that make this car very attractive to your wallet.
