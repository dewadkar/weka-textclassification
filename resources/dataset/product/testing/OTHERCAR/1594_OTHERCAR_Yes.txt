            Five years now, and, knock on wood, this little car has served me well.  I've replaced the tires because the factory ones started balding.  Just recently I had the starter replaced.  Other than that, with regular oil changes and a yearly inspection, this car has been just swell.  

At a sticker price of about $14,000, it's good on gas (29 MPH, city driving) and has a cute look (very similar to the '95 Toyota Carolla), but lacks a few of the standard features of other cars for the price-- like a bulb for light in the trunk!  I never realized how one little item could be missed so much.  I opted to forgo the bells and whistles of electric locks and windows, since my previous car had so many electrical problems.  I also don't even have a tape deck, just an AM/ FM Radio.  With a trade in worth $1,800, the balance, plus tax, seemed like plenty to pay for this automobile.

Now on the downside-- until I got my new tires, this car had a squeak in the suspension that drove me completely crazy.  I virtually had it in the garage for checking about 12 times while it was under warrantee, baffling all the mechanics.  They would tighten the suspension, replace parts, check tires, move mud flaps around, but the squeak always returned...that was until I got new tires.  So much for dealership mechanics.

I opted for teal blue, which must have been a phase I was going through, because basically I am a black or white person.  I tired of that color in 6 months.  The back seat could use a little more leg room, but other than that I'm pretty satisfied.  Oh, there is one more thing.  I think it's because of the color I selected, but whenever I get a scratch on the finish, it seems to turn white underneath and shows up pretty vividly.

Every ding and scratch was done in a parking lot when I wasn't around, but luckily the first real noticeable scratch didn't come until it was about 18 months old.  Somehow, those are easier to take than when a car is brand spanking new-- then if it gets scratched, you want to kill!

While I've been thinking I should look for a new vehicle before this one becomes of age where repairs are costly, I'm reluctant.  First, I don't want a car payment again, and second, I'm attached to my Prism, and it's such a big decision to have to make.  I can tell you this, though-- I have always wanted a Honda Accord...and that may be my next car.<br><br>
