            The XJ, for those who don't know, is the body designation for the Cherokee, the vehicle the X-Terra seems to compete most directly with, and it's about time, as the Cherokee hasn't had any real competition for many many years now.

When the X-Terra came out, I was excited. Finally there was another company who thought the same way Jeep and I did; that there should be a low-priced 4 door 4x4 that is truely a *UTILITY* vehicle, not a truck gussied up like a sedan, or worse, a sedan gussied up as a truck.

I wanted to pit it directly against the Cherokee in a side-by-side comparison, so I went out to several local Nissan dealerships and was told, quite bluntly, &quot;No.&quot; when I asked to borrow one for a day to pit it against the Cherokee I was &quot;Looking at buying&quot;. (grin).

So, I had to wait a year untill a friend of a friend had purchased a new X-Terra and wanted to go off-roading in it. Of course, my friend called me. I called more friends, and before you can find your C.W. McCall tapes, we had us a Convoy. (Up to Georgetown, Colorado and it's beautifull Guanella Pass. And we didn't even get hounded by smokeys.)

Now since my Jeep is heavily modified, and his was not, And I wanted to get a feel for stock-vs-stock, I left the BattleWagon at home, while a friend brought his 1998 Cherokee Sport. I rode up in the X-Terra, to both get a feel for it and give a brief &quot;How-To&quot; class of 4x4 driving.

I found that the X-Terra wasn't as powerfull or nearly as fast in acceleration (or able to hold speed up I-70's infamous Floyd Hill) as the I6 equipped Cherokee. Mind you, this isn't to say it &quot;Couldn't accelerate&quot; or &quot;Couldn't hold it's speed&quot;, it did both tasks admirably well, but the Cherokee did them Better. Score #1 and #2 for the Cherokee.

The Ride of the X-Terra was smoother than the Cherokee's. You still felt bumps and such in the X-Terra, and it let you know that it was a *TRUCK*, but the independant front end did smoothen things out a touch over the cherokee's traditional Live-Axle. Score one for the X-Terra.

Cargo space seemed larger than the Cherokee's as well, Score Two for the X-Terra.

They both boasted a 5,000lb tow rate. Tie. (Though the cherokee's engine would no-doubt tow much better in the hills. but we've allready awarded points for the cherokee in the engine department)

The same thing happened to the F-O-A-F (Friend-of-a-friend) I was riding with that everyone else who's gone to Georgetown up I-70 the first time encounters: that (*&amp;!(#&amp;!# Insta-stop exit!  If you're not aware of it and know to slow down ahead of time, you could be in for trouble, weather you're in a car or an SUV. Fortunitly, I knew about this problem ahead of time. Unfortunitly we were engaged in an in-depth conversation about Squaresoft's final fantasy series of games, and I failed to mention this to him.  The X-Terra's front brakes and rear drums kicked in when he realized the pickle he was in, and stopped it quite admirably. Unfortunitly, we weren't in the mood to do the same stop with the Cherokee, (Ive done that stop before with mine, but has aftermarket parts on the brakes, AND it's lifted up a bit), so comparing a stock Cherokee with a stock X-Terra in the brake department will have to wait for another day. If pressured I'd probobly give the edge to the Jeep; less weight with the same size brakes. But the X-Terras brakes did surprise me, so who knows! 

So after we calm down a bit and meet at the little italian restaraunt (Surprisingly good, I should do an epinion on it as well) in town for lunch, we head on towards the back of the historic little town (John Denver did a christmas movie set in this town, I can't remember the name right now.) and the sharp left turn to start the ascent up the twisting little pass.
Now the pass at this part is paved, though it's not like INTERSTATE pavement. It's just paved. I make sure his lights are on to alert other drivers, (its a narrow paved road, too) and up we go. the corners are pretty sharp, but the X-Terra didn't seem to roll too much. more than the Jeep did, but it's taller and the suspension is softer, so thats a trade off. 

We finally got up to a little dirt parking area with a steel fence and a waterfall to the north of it, with a tiny sign placed there by the US forest service: &quot;Waldorf Mine Trail&quot;, with a little icon of a Jeep CJ-ish vehicle (the code for &quot;4x4's only, no cars please because we don't want to pick up the peices later&quot;).

The beginning of the trail looks somewhat intimidating for a first time 4x4 driver, with large (about 6&quot; tall) rocks sticking out of the 'road'. This is probobly for the best, as it does keep back most people who don't know what they're doing, and the trail does even out later on, and could inspire those less-educated to whip across the trail at high speeds (Bad Idea #1, and if anyone's in town I'll show you 5 or 6 rusted out hulks at the bottom of the valley as examples of why you don't whip around real fast on that trail...)

We air down the tires, and have him watch the Wrangler go up, just to show him Yes, it's possible, and quite easy. (TJ Wranglers make everything LOOK easy.) 

So then we have him go up as a passanger in the Cherokee first, to show him the best wheel placement and how it's basically done in a vehicle of that size. He walks back down, and gets into his X-Terra, shifts it into 4x4 Low Range, and starts up, shooting nervous glances at me and the spotters. (it didn't really need spotters, but for the first time, you want a good confidence builder, right?) 

about half way up we hear a &quot;THUNK-SCRAAAPE&quot;, sounding like it's coming from the engine, and he just Stopped. (Not a good idea on an incline like that, but it wasn't too bad and the brakes held it in place, so I stepped out and the spotter and I took a look). While the Wrangler and the Cherokee had made it up with no-sweat, he had managed to hit a rock with enough force that the right wheel went up (in relation to the frame), leaving the front end dangerously low, and a rock took a bite at it.

Of course, the skid plate had a minor scratch in it, and that was all. Just bad luck and bad wheel placement (and bad suggestions from people who were spoiled by solid axles). No damage, and after letting him know &quot;thats what skid plates are for&quot;, he agrees to continue, at a slower rate, all of us being wary of the rocks. Score one for the Jeep. (and the rock). 

The rest of that rocky portion was smooth sailing, and the ride was quite a bit smoother than in the Cherokee (Due to the IFS). 
We scoot along the trail to an optional water crossing, with a moderate stream and very steep banks on both sides. The wrangler of course, splits off immediately and splish-splashes through and climbs up the other side, straight on. (Editors note: when taking a water crossing or ditch like this, it's best to do it diagonally so you don't get hung up in the middle. Editors note 2: Wrangler drivers love to show off usefullness of very short wheelbases.) 

The cherokee does it next, diagonally, and we convince the X-Terra driver to do it. down, through the water, and up the side, and a little &quot;Scrunch&quot; from the skidpad as it takes a tiny bite out of the top of the bank - the left wheel this time had gone &quot;too far up&quot; at the wrong time. But, thats what skid plates are for, and I'd also like to point out that the little water crossing would stop much any other vehicle in it's place. (that time last year I'd seen an outback get quite stuck there, and the wrangler driver noted he'd seen Jimmys and Explorers get mired there as well). Score a few for the water. ;) 

we turn around, and cross back the other way, and this time there wasn't any eating of turf from the X-Terra.

I have to note at this point that the X-Terra's sound system took this beating remarkably well, the CD-player didn't skip once, (though we had it turned off during the rock-eating-incident at the beginning), and the quality from the speakers was a bit nicer than that found stock in the Cherokee. Score one for the X-Terra (And score 3 for Pink Floyd).

From there we took the winding little dirt path up to some weird rangers station or another (I've never bothered to find out what the metal hanger-style building is, but it's got a very serious lock and half-inch thick plate steel shutters covering the windows, welded shut, I might ad. I wonder why that is...)  and to the abandoned mining town of Waldorf. Theres not much left of Waldorf but a few foundations, and we poked around the area for awhile and ate a late lunch (the previous lunch was more of a breakfast, really, but we all had hamburgers so... Score none for the cows.)

We packed up our trash and headed out to the &quot;New&quot; waldorf, a mine that was operated up untill the 60's or 70's (I'm not sure, but it's got some fairly modern stuff up there). The wrangler took a shortcut, showing off it's amazing articulation, both the cherokee and the X-Terra declined to follow (the cherokee I think could have made it I've seen stock XJ's take that before, but I'm not sure about the X-terra and it's front end, and he wasn't about to find out with his brand new $21,000 truck. I don't blame him).

we got up to the mine and played around on some of the rocks, the Cherokee scraped it's door on one, and the X-Terra's skid plates took a few more rock samples, (The wrangler of course just bounded over them), and were about to head back when another group of trucks showed up, and started asking about the X-Terra. They too were impressed that it made it over the water, and just nodded when he recalled the IFS inspired rock-eating. (one was driving a K5 Blazer, heavily modified, the other had an FJ-40 land cruiser). The X-Terra driver and I decided to take a rest and watch the traditional 'FJ-VS-JEEP' war that was undoubted to unfold, and sure enough it did, the TJ driver and the FJ driver both trying to impress each other by taking the most IMPOSSIBLE lines up steep rocks, neither of them backing down. when it started getting dark, the FJ driver said he was &quot;fairly impressed&quot; with the TJ, and the TJ driver said he was amazed the FJ didn't rust in two and fall apart. They traded phone numbers and we took off for Guanella pass. On our way down we noticed I-70 had a huge backup of cars (binoculars and mountaintops, instant traffic reports, gotta love it!) so we went the other way, over Guanella pass to I-285. I was even more impressed with the soft ride of the X-Terra as we pounded over the unpaved, rocky road that is Upper Guanella, and asked the Wrangler driver how he was doing. the CB just made a rude noise with some comments on how none of us could appreciate a REAL vehicle. ohwell. 

We pulled into Grant (the town, consisting of a diner and gas station nothing else, on the other side of the pass) about half an hour after sundown, aired up the tires and took I-285 back to Denver town. again I missed the Inline-6 of the Jeep going up Crow's Peak, (another very steep hill), but it did allright for itself. It buffeted around a little bit crossing Windy Point (which is... windy, imagine that), a bit more than the Cherokee, but the X-Terra is taller.

We pulled off of I-285 at kipling, as the wadsworth bridge was under emergency repair after it decided to throw some concrete at the rocks below, and took a cross street over to the Dennys and had dinner. (Good food, Dennys, I should write an Epinion on that too..)

The X-Terra driver thanked me for the good time, and we parted ways there so he could go back home, and I hitched a ride with the Cherokee back to my place, and noticed the harsher ride and somewhat weak sound system.

So, to sum it all up: Does the X-Terra compare with the Cherokee?

Yes.

Is it as good off-road as the cherokee?

In light to some moderate off-road, yyyyyeah, we did have trouble with the front end biting things, but it was certainly capable and kept up with the Jeep. Though if we were trying things that bring the Cherokee to the limits of it's capability, there was no doubt in my mind that the X-Terra would not be able to handle it. BUT, the Cherokee is a living legend in the 4-door-off-road circle, and it's a very few people who actually take their 4x4s to such extremes. we demonstrated that the X-Terra was more than capable of handling light-to-moderate 4x4 duties, that would stop Outbacks, CR-Vs, Rav-4s, and even some of the larger named vehicles (Blazer, Jimmy, etc) in their tracks. So the X-Terra gets my offical stamp of approval in the &quot;Off-road&quot; catagory, capable enough to handle most everything you throw at it, But not the absolutely insane things that I enjoy doing. 

Was the ride as good as the cherokees?

No. it was Better.

Was it as stable as the Cherokee? no, but it wasn't tipsy-turvey either.

Was it as powerfull as the Cherokee? No, but it wasn't underpowered either. (I should note that the original I6 cherokees had 177 HP, and was then upgraded to the 190+ they have now, and I suspect that within a year or two Nissan will add more grunt to their X-Terra.)

Was it competent in towing? 

Didn't have a chance to try it out, but I would say Yes, it was. Certainly moreso than the rest of it's competition in the CR-V, Outback, Rav-4 crowd.

Was the interior as nice as a Cherokees?

well, keep in mind that there's what, 80 different trim lines in the Cherokee? from the base SE to the Sport to the Classic to the Limited, etc, etc, etc. 

When compared to the interior of the Sport model, (which this X-Terra seemed to best compete against price-wise), I would say they're equal. Both are fairly no-nonsense. and I did like the first-aid pack in the rear. (Score one big one for the X-Terra there. everyone should have a first aid pack in their car, reguardless what they drive, where they drive, or how they drive it.)

How was the sound system?

Better than the Cherokee's. 

Gas milage we didn't pay much attention to, but the EPA numbers give the Cherokee better milage. 

How was the 4x4 System? 

well, you do have to slow down to 25mph to shift into and out of 4wd on-the-fly, and the ONLY option is for a part-time system. The Jeep we went with had the more substantial NV-242 &quot;Selec-Trac&quot; system. (Same transfer case used in the Hummer), which had a locking viscous coupled center differential, which can automatically transfer powere from front to rear when needed, in full time mode. (we had it locked in part time mode, splitting torque 50/50 just like the X-Terras part time system for the duration of the off-road fun though.) The Cherokee's full time system only comes into its own on-road in poor weather conditions. 

But the lack of any such system in the X-Terra did dissapoint me, I've fallen in love with Selec-Trac, and the 25mph shifting limit was rather confusing to me, I KNOW they can make cases shift at faster speeds than that. Jeeps part-time (command trac) system can shift &quot;at any safe highway speeds&quot; (in the manual, I love that line. Realistically it's limited at 55mph)

But, the low-range gearing was the same as the Jeeps (a healthy 2.7:1), which some 4x4s don't have. 

So I would say it was a Competant 4wd system, but nowhere near as good as the Selec-Trac case, and still falls short of the Command-Trac in the Jeep. (though realistically, if you're going over 25mph and need to shift into 4wd, 4wd's not going to save your butt reguardless of what mode you're in)

How was the cargo space?

It seemed larger than the Jeeps.

Would you reccomend this vehicle to a friend?

Yes. I'd reccomend they Test drive a Cherokee as well, though. These vehicles are VERY closely matched. the Cherokee has the brute strength and the off-road prowess, while the X-Terra has the softer ride and nicer sound system.
