            Hey my parents had the excel for a few years and 60,000 miles and it never gave them any trouble so I bought it from them for colloage. well it now has 210,000 mile trouble free thats right. It is fun to drive it's a five speed.The intierior is not the best meterialls but they stay intacted very well. The one thing that I don't care for is the acceleration it is peppy but not enough. I am really suprized that it has never given me trouble because I have beaton the cr*p out of it. Every were accept epinions people like the excels. I think any body should buy this car even if it had 200,000 miles when bought. I just bought a 2001 Hyundai tiburon. Hyundai has come along way the interior is excelent and is butiful. That thing is fast. Hyundai rules!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
