            In 1998 Consumer Reports Said the New Forester Was &quot;All That&quot;.. I looked at Honda, Toyota, Chevy.. and a few more.. I ended up with a Forester!  What a great choice.. It is by far the best and I mean BEST vehicle I have ever had!  I had not had very good luck with some of the previous American made cars.. and I figured I would try a Japanese Car.. By Far it is the best vehicle I had, much better than a Van (as this has 4 doors) and not as big and scarey as a full sized SUV.  It fits the family of four and our dog.  We have taken it camping with us and fit everything in it and in the cargo carrier we bought from Subaru.  This is an Awesome Auto!<br><br>
