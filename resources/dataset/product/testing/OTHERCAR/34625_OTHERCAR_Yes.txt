            I bought my 1999 Subaru Legacy L Sedan SE due to my father's recommendation... I lived in the country, and I needed something that had four-wheel drive (yet still being a car).  I naturally thought of Subaru...

I love the entire car!  The ride is great, the stock stereo sounds great (CD and tape), and there is plenty of room.  Even the rims are nice... I pay attention to details like that.  For a new car, it came nice stock-configured.  Subaru's seem to run forever, yet their bodies (in my opinion) seem to rot quickly.  I am watching this on my car...

I don't like the fact that it didn't come with the actual cigarrette lighter (only a black cap... somewhat cheap).  Also, it doesn't get the best gas milage (does a car ever?), and the power is good, but not the best.  I am used to V-8's.

I would recommend this car for anyone who needs a four-wheel drive car... I will own mine for many more moons...<br><br>
