            I purchased my 2000 Grand Cherokee Limited in the 3rd quarter of 2000.  The dealer was wonderful (Deur Speet Motors, Fremont, MI).  The Jeep is ok.  

I've driven german sedans for years - primarily BMW and Audi's.  I had a BMW X5 on order, but due to heavy backorder times - I bit on Jeep's low interest rate offer and picked up my loaded Grand Cherokee.  

The Grand Cherokee is wonderful off road.  I have associates with Range Rovers, Discovery's, and an assortment of US and Japanese SUV's.  The Grand Cherokee can out do them all off road - with the possible exception of the Range Rover and Discovery.  The Grand Cherokee does SEEM to be lighter off road than the Land Rover vehicles, but they would get the nod if the driving got REALLY ROUGH (I'm speaking of the type of off road that less than 1% of people even consider).

On road manners are quite acceptable - given that it's an SUV.  There are some vague spots in the handling - but nothing too scary.  It seems to cruise down the road, particularily the highway.

For an SUV, I'm willing to say this is a pretty good vehicle.  I want an SUV in my garage, but I'm going to look for a at another BMW to drive every day and keep the Jeep for the times that I need the hauling capacity or feel like going off road.
