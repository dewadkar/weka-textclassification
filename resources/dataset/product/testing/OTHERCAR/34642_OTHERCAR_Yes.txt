            This is THE van of vans! I was hesitant at first because I am an experienced van owner. However, after climbing aboard and test driving this van, I was hooked!  I have 4 daughters and family in other states. This van had something for everyone with a video and advanced sound system that is perfect for long trips. Each person could do something different at the same time as any other in the van using headphones so others are not disturbed. After experiencing previous vans with only 1 sliding side door, I have to say I fell in love with the remote sliding 2nd side door. I didn't have to walk all the way around the van to retrieve a child or belongings. I definitely recommend the extended fully loaded Montana if you have children.  I also purchased this van used at 1 year old with an extended warranty. The ride and steering is smooth with seats that can be customized to provide extra comfort. The Montana drives more like a car instead of the typical extended van. It handles quite nicely on snow covered roads and slid very little on ice covered roads. It also gives "peace of mind" to moms, with a built in compressor to allow for the unexpected flat tire. It also includes convenient sound system controls right on the steering wheel in the exact area that the hands rest for ease of use. The steering wheel/driver controls override all other controls so that mom/driver is always in charge. After 2 1/2 years of ownership, I am even more impressed by the thought that was given to the design and placement of each control knob and accessory. If you want to be spoiled rotten and pampered by a vehicle, this is the one for you. Fortunately we purchased the extended warranty because less than 1 year after the purchase, the transmission went out. However, we were told that it was a manufacturing error and the warranty did cover it. I have had no problems with the transmission since. I also had to return it to the dealership 3 times for safety recalls on the remote side door. Right after we purchased it, the remote side door would not close properly. After receiving the safety recalls, it has worked fine. It also had an oil leak that the warranty covered. I have also noticed some road noise as the van has aged. Now that all the kinks have been repaired, there have been no further problems.
