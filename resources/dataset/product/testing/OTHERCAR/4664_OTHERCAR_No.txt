            I purchased a used 1996 Cavalier over a year ago for $9750 CDN or $6500 USD.  It is a 2 door coupe with 5 speed.  The car has had its share of mechanical problems in the form of check engine / ABS lights coming on.  So far I have had to replace some kind of OBD sensor and a sensor for the anti-lock braking system.  All in all, I have had approximately $750 of unexpected repairs since I bought this vehicle.  Also two recalls during that same time span makes me wonder about the quality of General Motor's low end vehicles.

I also had to recently replace the clutch and bearing for $550.  I believe they wore out prematurely at only 31,000K even though I do a lot of city driving and sometimes drive it hard.  The parts for the clutch are VERY expensive.  Double the cost of many other cars.  (Do a search on the internet to compare clutch costs relative to other models).  Low quality parts but high prices, it makes you wonder how GM manages to make billions in profit every year (Sarcasm intended).

Mechanical problems aside, the car is ok for basic transportation.  Gas consumption is reasonable but not outstanding and performance isn't too good.  With a five speed transmission, you can squeal the tires in first and second gears.  It has some pep off the line but once you hit 60 km/h (approx. 40 mph) the lack of power is noticeable.  I had the opportunity to drive a 4 door rental Cavalier with automatic recently and can assure you that it is significantly slower than the 5 speed.  

I would normally recommend the stick since it has better performance and lower fuel consumption but the clutch is a major concern.  It is very expensive and lets just say not of the highest quality.  It would be interesting to find out when the clutch started slipping on other people's Cavaliers.  I am sure there will be people saying they can get 100,000K on a clutch but I bet they do mostly highway driving.

Thus the automatic sucks due to slow performance and the manual sucks due to poorly made parts that are way to expensive.

Overall, if you are looking for a basic car for a cheap price but with tons of problems look no further.<br><br>
