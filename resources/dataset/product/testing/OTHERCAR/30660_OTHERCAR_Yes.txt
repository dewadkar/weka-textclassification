            I must admit that I am not as satisfied with my 1997 Grand Cherokee as I thought I would be.  There has been two recalls on it already.  The main one being the gas gauge malfunction (which I had figured out before the recall!!).  It is hard explain exactly what it is about this truck that I'm dissatisfied with.  The main thing that I noticed is little details that are missed.  This is the first American made and engineered auto I have purchased and I will go back to Japanese next time.  Little details that are missed by American auto makers are missed by me in this truck.  The back hatch is hard to open and the lamp switch for the hatch does not work and quit working within the first two years.  The first problem I had was the passenger side door not fitting correctly.  They tried to refit it but it did not work.  After three years, we have just learned to slam the door.
The upside is that basically for the money it is a good value.  Nothing exceptional.  I have enjoyed its reliability in bad weather.  That is the thing that I will miss when we trade it in.<br><br>
