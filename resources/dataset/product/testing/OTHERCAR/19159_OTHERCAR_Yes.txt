            In the last 8.5 years, I have owned 6 cars, a 91 acura integra ls special, a 94 integra GSR coupe, a 95 dodge grand caravan, a 95 porsche 911, a 97 nissan pathfinder and now a 99 passat wagon GLS. My wife has had a 93 Integra rs coupe and now owns a 98 accord lx. So I have driven quite a few cars. Before I had the passat, I was driving the pathfinder. It was a nice truck, very comfortable, but I didn't like the feeling of being so high and it had no power, especially after owning a porsche for a year and half. We test drove the passat and immediately fell in love with it. It handles really well for a station wagon. It's got lots of power with the 1.8 liter, 4 cylinder turbo engine. It's fun to drive and it feels solid. 

Closing the doors makes this nice solid thunk. Doing the same on my wife's accord sounds like droping a tin can. The car is very roomy. We bought it because we like to go camping and I like to windsurf. We can haul a lot of stuff with it. Even with a lot of camping gear in it or five 200 pound men in it, it still has plenty of power to go up hills. 

It's also very comfortable. The seats adjust up and down, front to back, there is lumbar support. The steering wheel telescopes and tilts so you can really adjust your driving position. 

The dash looks very cool at night. It is blue and red. Very high tech looking. Everyone that I have taken in my car loves it. They think it's very cool. It is also very functional. All controls are in the right place.

You get a lot of car for your money. I bought it beginning of august 98 and now have 20000 miles on it. I haven't had a single problem with it. I bring it in for it's free service every 5000 miles. I average 24mpg half of it is city driving the other is highway driving. 

There are 3 things I don't like about the car.
1. seat fabric gathers lint a lot makes it look dirty. Should have gotten leather instead.
2. Cupholders are rather flimsy. 
3. a knob is turned to recline the seat, this should be a lever.

We love the passat wagon so much that we are wanting to sell my wife's accord and get a passat sedan GLS with leather, sunroof and alloy wheels. This car is not boring like the honda accord or the camry. In fact the accord and camry look very similar. The passat stands out. It looks and is solid. It's fun to drive which is more than my wife and I can say about her accord. Also, my parents bought the same exact car after I recommended it to them and they test drove one. My sister and her husband are getting one this year after the lease on their BMW 328i is up.

I highly recommend it. <br><br>
