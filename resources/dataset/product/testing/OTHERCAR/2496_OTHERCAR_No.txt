            My parents bought me a new 1995 Hyundai Elantra.  The first year the car experienced no problems.  After the first year I have had to change my brakes and struts (suspension).

A host of other problems: the sun visor stopped functioning so that they just droop down, had to take them off and now use my hand to do their job (cost to replace both of them is $90, just in parts--can't find used ones--didn't fix it);

the steering is very shaky, the rotors are warped (too expensive to try and fix);

the transmission leaks fluid, got serviced twice, but still not fixed... the car can be jerky (even though it is automatic transmission);

the car has stalled many a time (don't know why), just today my car won't start back up again, more engine problems ??;

the standard wheel rims cracked and had to replace TWO of them!! (expensive, $70 each, couldn't find used);

the battery had to be replaced within its first year;

the a/c does not work;

the two front windows got stuck and wouldn't function, because the pulley like system got all tangled up, (cost to repair $300)...

uneven tire wear, even though rotate religiously;

oil leaks;

something is wrong with the fuel gasket;

I think the timing is shot to hell;

strange sound comes when braking!! (not the brakes, had it checked by 3 mechanics, didn't know what the sound is coming from)...;

braking is not smooth, long distance assumed when braking before car will come to complete stop;

had to have the drum replaced, bearing shot;

hood won't open!;

passenger door panelling (where the seat belt attaches to the door) keeps coming off and gets in the way when trying to shut the door;

the automatic door lock works when it feels like;

paint chips very easily;

body dents extremely easily;

the bumber is made out of fiberglass and so both the front and the rear are really cracked;

it is pretty embarrasing to have people ride in the car with all the strange noises coming from the engine, the jerky motion that comes, the possiblity of the car stalling, things coming apart in the car, no sun visors.  it is also embarrasing to take the car to a mechanic.  really a very very very poor quality car!!!!

I have tried to take good care of the car, try to fix what I can afford, take it for regular servicing, work on it myself as much as possible, but I'm just not able to keep up with the rate at which it falls apart.  I am still kind of attached to the darn thing, since it's my first car and all, but it is a love hate relationship.
