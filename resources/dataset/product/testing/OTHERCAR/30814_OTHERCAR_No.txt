            My friend bought this camera and let me borrow it on my trip to vegas. I have to say this was not as bas as i thought. Although it had a flash it was not very good taking pictures at night. I recommend when you take shots, take in a very well lit area or daytime. Another thing is this camera has no zoom, so it was hard to take pictures on one person, you would get soooo many people in the picture. And this camera is 1.3 megapix. This is good quality, but i recommend 2.2 or higher, it makes a big difference in quality. The price is probably the best thing. It was goin for 299.99 at bestbuy. This is one the cheaper cameras with a lcd screen on it. If are willing to spend more money then get the nikon or sony digital camera. Another good thing is the media. There are no pics to develop and it was sooo easy to download them to my computer and email it to all my friends. This is the cost advantage then to other regualar cameras. but all in all....i would wait till prices go down.<br><br>
