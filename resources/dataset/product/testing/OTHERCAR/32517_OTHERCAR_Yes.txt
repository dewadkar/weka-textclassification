              I "upgraded" to this A6 2.7t from my previous Audi, a '98 A4 2.8. The A6 is much roomier than it's little brother, and also quite a bit bigger inside than it's closest rival, the BMW 5 series. 
  From the 3 engine choices available, I chose the A6 2.7t- a twin turbo V6 that is also used in Audi's sporty S4. IMHO, this engine is the way to go. It is almost as powerful as the pricey V8 model, and only slightly more expensive than the naturally aspirated V6.
  This car is fast, faster than anyone reasonably needs a car to be. The car has 250 hp and 258 lb/ft of torque. More importantly, all that torque is available from just 1850 rpm, thanks to those two turbos. Appropriately, the A6 is equipped with huge disc brakes which swiftly bring all that power to halt when necessary.
  For a large and fairly heavy car, the A6 handles extremely well with the sports package suspension. If you are a spirited driver, get the optional 17" wheel/tire combo. The 16s are inadequate for a car this big and powerful.
  Audis are known for their winter performance, and the A6 is terrific in the snow. In addition to quattro, the car is equipped with Electronic Stability Protection. ESP is the only system I know of that can correct a skid in deep snow. Of course, if you want to pull four wheel drifts around a racetrack, you can turn the system off.
  Like all Audis, the interior on the A6 is superb. The seats and driving position are excellent, with numerous adjustments including multiway lumbar support and tilt/telescope steering wheel. The cabin is luxurious and downright beautiful, yet never ostentatious.
  Competition to the A6 ranges from other sports sedans to luxury "crossover" SUVs. In the dry, the A6 can out maneuver most sedans. In the snow and the wet, its superior quattro system allows it to go places that many SUVs fear. There is little to fault in this car.
