            I did a fair amount of research and narrowed between the Fuji 3800 and the Olympus 730.  The Olympus won my business for several reasons, well worth the approx. $50 pricing differences I saw on the web. The 730 is a quite capable enthusiast's camera down deep, yet allows immediate good results via its preset shooting modes.  I just returned from a week in Ireland and used several of the presets: portrait, landscape, portrait with landscape, sports, and night shot.  So far I've printed up to 5x7s with perfectly satisfying results, so I'd say the 3.2 megapixels are more than adequate for what I do.

It takes the new xD cards, which I read are easier on power consumption. I bought the Olympus 128MB card (about $12 more than generic versions I priced) because it enables the stitching together of multiple shots into a panorama.

The 730 comes with proprietary lithium batteries which have so far given me 170 shots and a moderate use of the LCD.  Battery life meter is still on High setting.  I will use my 1800MA NiMH rechargeables when the Olympus batteries die.

Three notes on "good to do" actions:  1.) get familiar with the menus and way that certain key options are nested and accessed.  You'll probably buy the camera because it offers fine flexibility in white balance settings, aperture or shutter priority, for example- but you have to be able to access them readily.  This just takes some reading of the manual and practice.  2.) related to this, setting white balance is imperative to get your best results, especially indoors.  Now I literally see the importance of this (would like to have a few indoor shots to do over).  3.) you may want to carry a tripod or monopod to stabilize when using the upper end of the zoom.
