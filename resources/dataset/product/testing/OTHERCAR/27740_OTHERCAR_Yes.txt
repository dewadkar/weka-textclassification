            First of all, I want to make something clear. I am in no way an expert in photography. I do not even know ANYTHING about photography. I am just someone who is in the market for a point and shoot camera, because I didn't even have a camera at all. 

When I went shopping around for a digital camera I had a budget of around $150, and would be contented with 1.3 mega pixel. But as I saw what my options are, I got greedy and raised my budget to about $250 for at least a 2 mega pixel. But even $250 is really steep for a college student. For $250 for a 2 mega pixel camera, I really only had 1 option, the HP 315. Circuit City had it on sale for $249. When I went to Office Depot, they had the S100 in the sale items cabinet for $175. I bought the thing without thinking twice about it. Since they only had two left, I figured that at that price, it will be gone soon. And I can always return it if I found a better deal, which I doubted. I knew that I would not find another 2 mega pixel camera for less than $200. 

Things I like: 

Image quality: this camera will not be able to compete with the other cameras, that the pros use, but for someone who just want a camera to use and take pictures with everyday, this is the best camera for it. Most people say that this camera is no good at the dark. I tested it in a completely dark room. The flash works pretty good. the edges are kinda dark, but you can see the subject clearly. 

Size: it is about the same dimension as a credit card with a depth of about an inch. In the pocket, it barely bulges out. I only had this camera for about a week, and I literally carry it every where i go. I see some of my friends when I go around places and I just like being able to take those impromptu pictures right there and then. My friend had the HP 315 and he takes it everywhere and it's just really cool to be able to take all those pictures. 

Instant gratification: I know that this is true for all digital cameras, but I really like how you don't have to get the pictures developed to see them. 

Things I don't like: 

One thing I really don't like about this camera is that it had troubles capturing fast moving images. It seems like a lot of the pictures I taken with moving subjects turns out into a blur. 

The other things I don't like about this camera are the small things like no case included, and no AC adapter. The optional AC adapter does not connect directly to the camera. Instead it comes with something that looks like the propreitary battery and the adapter attaches to that. It did come with a battery recharger, the kind that plugs into a wall outlet. It would have been nicer if the adapter attaches somewhere else in the camera. To me, this is a design flaw. Because, what if you want to use the camera, and you only have one battery? If they had included an AC adapter that attaches to a different place other than the battery compartment, then maybe you will have two options on charging the battery; either with the plug in charger, or in the camera. 

Finding a case for this camera is pretty hard. I bought the smallest case I could find from Wal-Mart for $5, and even that is too big. I finally ordered the case that was made for it from Staples.com for $10 plus a rediculous $7 for shipping. But i didn't have any choice. Just to give you an idea of how small this is, I put the camera inside the PowerShot case, and that whole thing fits inside the case i got from Wal-Mart.

-------------------- 

The battery last a pretty good amount of time. I have a 48 mb compact flash, and with one charge of battery, I was able to take 60 1600 x 1200 fine and about 70 640 x 480. I had the flash on 90% of this time. I had the LCD on for about 5 images on the 1600 x 1200, and the LCD is on, on all the 640 x 480 images I took. I think that a reasonable expectation is about 150 clicks with flash mostly on and using the LCD half the time. Most people claim that they can only get about 75-80 clicks with the LCD on all the time. I would suggest getting an extra battery if you plan to take this on vacations. But if you just plan on taking this camera for those everyday spur of the moment pictures, then I think the one that came with the camera is enough. I doubt that anybody would need take 80 pictures with out any special occasions. 

The unit came with an 8 mb compact flash card. This can hold about 46 640 x 480 fine images, OR about 12 1600 x 1200 fine, OR 4 1600 x 1200 super fine. The camera also knows how much memory you have left on a memory card and estimates how many pictures you have left. 

I have been playing around with the stitch assist mode. In this mode, the camera will allow you to take a picture and move that picture to the side allowing you to try to line up the next shot to that picture. The Canon software that came with the camera knows what pictures you have taken in stitch assist mode, and allows you to open the software to put them together. The software will automatically detect all the overlapping pictures and put them together to make a long panoramic picture. This works most of the time. The only time the program have troubles aligning the pictures is when the angles are drastically different. When trying to capture a panoramic view, try to make the angel of the camera as consistent as possible. 

A word on memory cards. If you value your pictures, do not skimp on the memory card. I have seen cheap compact flash like the Memorex, and a no name brand they sell in the Wal-Mart website. I have read pretty bad reviews on the Memorex cards. I play the PlayStation. When I bought Final Fantasy IX, it came with a cheap memory card. I stored some of my hard earned saves on it only to find out a week later that the data went corrupt and I lost all my saves. From then on, I learned never to skimp on memory products. Some of the good brands I can think of right now are Lexar and Sandisk.

Over all, this is the best digital camera that I found for what I intend to use it and for the price. My friend's HP 315 does not take people pictures really good. His camera makes most pictures of people faces really shiny making them look greasy. Some of our friends are really PHINE looking girls, but his camera makes most of them really ugly. I have not experienced this problem with the Canon S100. 

Update (Aug 13, 2001): I was just testing the S100 on it's battery life. I did 3 sets of tests. I estimate that I used the flash about 85% - 90% of the time for all tests. All these tests were done on a 64 megs compact flash card. 

1600 x 1200 Fine / LCD on all the time = 111 images at 55 megs. 

640 x 480 Fine / LCD on all the time = 124 images at 9.3 megs. 

640 x 480 Fine / LCD off (I used the LCD for previewing the images. This camera allows you to preview your images, when you kept holding down the shutter button after the shot is taken. The minimum amount of time that the image is on the display is about 2.5 seconds. The image will not disapear as long as you are holding down the shutter button.) = after 297 shots, the low battery indicator started to appear. I was able to get out 360 shots at 31.8 megs. This one test spanned 1 hour and seven minutes. 

Update (Nov 15, 2001): I was just reading my own review and realized that the test numbers I got might be a little over exagerrated. Yes, these are the results I have, but this is taking shots immediately one after another. In real world use, you would rarely do this. I am pretty sure that this would affect the battery life somehow. Just expect about 80-90 clicks with minimal use of the LCD. And about 50 clicks with the LCD on 100% of the time.

After doing these tests, I suggest that you practice aiming your camera. With a little practice, it is possible to take pictures with out using either the LCD nor the optical view finder. It will save you a lot of battery time if you only use the LCD to preview shots right after taking them. You then have the option to either keep or delete the picture if it did not turn out well.
