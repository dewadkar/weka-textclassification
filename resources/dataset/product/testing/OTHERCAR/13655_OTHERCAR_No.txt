            You want to spend all your time back at the dealership getting it fixed.
I've got to admit, it's cut and a reasonable price, but that's where the goodness ends.
I have had mine in the shop 10 times and it has been for ten different things.  My four-wheel drive didn't work, three different recalls, an exhaust leak, which the had to replace the cadalitic converter, a cracked exhaust manifold, a dead altenator a week after they tightened the belts and they said it wasn't there fault, the check engine light kept coming on, the windows have a wicked air leak which they can't fix, my pull cable for the spare tire broke off.  I know there is more because sometimes it was for multiple reasons.  
I think the best one was when they did an oil change and forgot to put the cap back on.  There was oil all over the engine and I was lucky that I didn't run out of oil and blow a rod.
The engine bucks on the highway, but it doesn't do it for them.
It has a horrible suspension system.
I think the best thing is the $600 cd player that blew a speaker when i only had it for two weeks.
Need I say more???
