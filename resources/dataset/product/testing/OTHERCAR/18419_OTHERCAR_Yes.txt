            I bought this car before the summer because I was planning a road trip and wanted a small, sporty convertible for the trip. I've never owned a convertible before, but as soon as I got behind the wheel of this car, I was in love. True, it is much smaller with less room than I'm used to in a car, but when I got out onto that freeway with the wind blowing and felt the freedom of the open road, I forgot all about the interior.
The acceleration is not the greatest, but it does reach some pretty high speeds without much effort. Like I said, the interior is pretty cramped, but the layout of the dashboard is good. 
I would recommend this car for somebody who is looking for a fun, sporty car and isn't worried about lack of room in the interior or trunk. <br><br>
