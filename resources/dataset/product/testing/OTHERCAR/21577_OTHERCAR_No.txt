            I really liked this car for the first 3 years of its life. Since then, it's been a nightmare. This year alone, I'm looking at something like $4000 in repair bills.

The water pump died this fall. Cost: about $500.

I've been battling with a lousy air conditioner for years, and the thing is almost dead. The dealer says it will need to be replaced this summer. I'm sure that it'll be maybe $1000.

The fuel rails cracked, and almost caused the thing to go up in flames (darn the luck, that would have been a total loss!). After fighting with the dealer, I got Chrysler to eat the $1500 repair bill. Several months later, the fuel rail thing became a recall. Hmmm...

This winter, with about 75,000 miles on it, the tranny has decided it's time to shuffle off this mortal coil. The dealer's putting in a reman unit for $2400. What a bargain.

I called Chrysler, and they refuse to do anything about it. It seems that if your car blows up with anything higher than 36,000 miles on it, it's not their problem. Whatta load of hooey -- quality, my rear end!

The thing is almost ready for the freakin' junk heap. I can't afford to trade it in on a new car. My best bet would be to sell it and buy something else used. I'm starting to think that ANYTHING would be better than this.

Needless to say, this experience has changed my entire opinion about Chrysler. I used to be a fan. Now I've lost my innocence, and I'm ready to accept the fact that the era of Chrysler Quality and Customer Service is long gone.
