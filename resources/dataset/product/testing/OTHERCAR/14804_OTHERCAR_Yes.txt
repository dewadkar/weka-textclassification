            I have owned a 1991 Daytona ES for over 3 years now- with 129,000 it's still on the road. It's a great looking little car that sadly, can't hide the fact that it's based on the 1981 Chrysler K-car. (remember those?) Performance doesn't live up to the looks-though with the available 224 hp. turbo- it'd be a lot funner to drive- still this car looks good where ever it goes! Reliability has been fair for a car of this age-I have never had a MAJOR repair-just the regular stuff - wires, plugs, oil, I did have to replace the radiator ($300.00) but not the end of the world.
