            We were looking for an economical but more luxurious car after 13 really great years with an Accord. The cash price for the &quot;base&quot; G20 was about the same as an Accord EX 4 cylinder. Some good friends of ours were on their second G20, and really loved their car and the level of service at the dealership. We now have over 11K miles on our G20. It is, to us, kind of an affordable alternative to a BMW (for about $10K less...). 

Handling is superb. We get 26 to 28 mpg in the city and up to 37 (yes!) on freeway trips. Real luxury is being able to afford to drive your &quot;luxury car&quot;, in my opinion.
 The Bose sound system is probably worth up to a thousand $ if one were to add it to another car. The sound quality is excellent, base response and all, to quite high levels. Seats are good, and fit me (6'2&quot; tall) well for long trips. There is a slightly less room for rear seat passengers than cars like the Accord or Mazda 626, or the larger Infiniti I30. Power locks and windows and remote entry and alarm are all standard, as are the sharp-looking alloy wheels and low profile tires.

For a sticker price of $21.5K and a cash-deal price of $18.1K, we could not beat this deal anywhere. The Touring model adds limited slip (very unusual in front wheel drive cars) and a cosmetic wing on the rear of the trunk lid. The dealer likes to sell the leather seat and sunroof models for an extra few thousand, but this would have gone way over our budget.

For trivia buffs, this car was developed and sold for a while in Europe as a Nissan-badged car, and unlike the I30 has no Nissan twin in the US market.
At 2950 pounds the general &quot;feel&quot; is like a much larger car, and while the 2 liter engine will not compete with a V6, it pulls effortlessly to 5000+ rpm with full torque all the way, any time. It is red-lined much higher, but we are conservative drivers. It is docile in traffic at 1500 rpm, and not at all fussy. I would guess that a *lot* of engineering went into it.
I should note that the dealer recommends the 5 speed rather than the automatic, if you press them for their personal opinion. I drove an automatic version while our car was in for routine service (free loaners are s.o.p. @ Infiniti) and can say that it was fine, albeit with a little loss of power due to the torque converter. The 5-speed is just a lot more fun!

If I can pry my wife's hands off the steering wheel long enough I plan to enter an autocross for fun one of these days. It is that kind of sports sedan. Downshifts are easy and the clutch is smooth. Folks who really need big interiors and pretentious people will want to spend lots more $$$ on &quot;real&quot; Bimmers and Lexi, but this is about the most car for the dollar in the luxury market.
Last but not least I should mention the 60K mile warranty.
**Note: This is an &quot;edit&quot; as of 5-20-00. When I first posted this opinion, it was into the I30 forum, because at that date there was no G20 forum. Epinions has not moved the review, at my request, nor have they responded to me. I felt that some explanation was needed as to why this review is in the &quot;wrong&quot; forum. Thank you.<br><br>
