            In 1996 we bought our first Geo Tracker.  It was a 4 wheel drive, 1993, 2 door soft top kind.  At first I hated it.  Not because there was any thing wrong with it, but because it was a standard, and I had no idea how to drive it.  Once I figured it out though, I loved it.

Our 1993 Tracker is now 8 years old and still running great.  We have had virtually no problems out of it (and we don't even keep the oil changed like we should!).  Any problems that we have had have been induced by us.  For example, my husband has put 2 dents in it, forced it into gear (and grinds them quiet often-to think he taught me how to drive it and now he doesn't do too good!), and got it stuck in 3-4 foot of water.  Getting it stuck in the water didn't occur just after one trip through the water, it occured after about his third.

Anyway, it gets great gas milage, approxiamately 27 miles to a gallon, and it didn't use any oil until &quot;some mechanic&quot; who probably had one to many beers got a hold of it.  No, it was not my husband.  We've got the oil problem fixed now though.  This vehicle is small and doesn't have a lot of room, but it is roomier than it does appear.  4-5 people can ride comfortably.  The seats belts work great.  The ones in the backseat are some of the best that I have found that are cooperative with a carseat.  They are long enough to properly fit most carseats, and they tighten up good to hold carseats secure.  This is big plus!

This vehicle was bought before we were thinking of a family, but it has served us well.  I wasn't as comfortable with it though when our son arrived because of it's soft top.  So, we bought another tracker.  It is a '99, and we just got it a couple of months ago.  So far, it seems just as dependable.  It has 4 doors and more room, and it is a hard top.  It is not 4 wheel drive though, but we still have our other one which is good because right now we have icy roads and we wouldn't be able to any where with out it.  Our '99 doesn't use oil either, and it gets 29-30 miles to a gallon.

Both vehicles are great, and I see no reason for any future vehicle purchases to not be Geo Trackers as well.  <br><br>
