            I didn't buy my Acura Integra used, but it's really, really used by now.  In an age when most people don't keep their cars more 2-3 years, mine is hanging in there for it's thirteenth.  I hope you will forgive my comparing it to a pet... maybe a cat, perhaps, but I am a veterinarian and don't really know how to talk 'car'.  This has been a great member of the family, and I feel obligated to let others know what a great beast it's been.

I got my black Acura when it was a newborn, back in 1988, for a mere $12,000 (approximately), after test driving a variety of other sporty cars (Eclipse, Honda CRX, Celica) and it was the best choice considering feel on the road, and cost.  Black was a poor coat color choice I was to find out later- always looked dirty and HOT in the middle of the summer (so hot the key in the ignition would be hard to hold on to)... but that was the only wrong move.  

The 4 cylinder, 118 horsepower internal organs aren't much to brag about, but maybe those 4 valves per cylinder, or the finely tuned engine.. or whatever makes an engine work smoothly and efficiently, more than made up for it, since I was still able to keep up with other cars on the road (here in LA, that's about 85-90 mph), and even pass up a few.

The resale value today may not be much, but it's reputation has made it a pretty good sell, as a well as a good used buy.  Both my father's car, a Chrysler New Yorker, and my humble Acura were bought the same years... only his was $12,000 more new.  And in just 4 short years they had the exact same resale value- wow!  

And today, 13 years later, there is hardly any difference... maybe a little pinging (been a while since the poor thing went in for a check up).  My car is not longer black.  After it got bumped into by a truck one week, and a buck the next (hit a deer), it needed a whole new paint job... and since I had my pick of color, the obvious choice was purple.  Maybe the only purple Acura Integra in the world?  And I had some timing chain replaced, a new clutch put in, 4 new windshields (lived in New Mexico for 4 years... hard on windshields), some new batteries, countless air filters and I have lost count of the numbers of new tires.  

200,000 miles... burns a little oil, but purrs like ever.  I can still eke out 400 miles to a tank of gas (around 27 miles per gallon).  And  it still keeps up with the 85-90 mph crowd, still turns that 90 degrees onto Ventura blvd. without having to wear out the brakes, and still starts perfectly.  I drive this poor old creature 65 miles + a day in rush hour traffic, or zip up to San Francisco, down to Mexico or out of state, and it's been so dependable I no longer even have nightmares about all the times we were stranded on the roads back when I was a kid (dad always bought American... great patriot but automotively challenged).  

So even though it didn't start out that way, it's definitely a used car, and what a great deal it was, too.  I definitely recommend this machine to anyone interested in getting a dependable, sporty used car.
