            ...then I'd have to buy one of these.

I never would have chosen to drive what I would consider a luxury car, but when the keys are handed to me for free --- hey, what the heck.

When the mechanic told me that the steering pump they were putting in my Explorer had broken, and they couldn't get a new one till the next day, I figured I was going to have to bum a ride home. He surprised me by saying, &quot;We're gonna have to rent you a car 'til tomorrow.&quot;

About 10 minutes later a lady walks in, takes my information and hands me the keys. I walk out, figuring its a Rent-A-Wreck Special.

Boy was I wrong. I was almost afraid to get in. I'm not known for my grace and poise. Sometimes I break things, ya know....

Maybe its just because I haven't driven a new car since 1989 when my Dad let me drive his new Crown Vic with the dark brown velvet interior and tons of room. Made me feel rich just sitting in it.

This is better.

Of course I was fascinated/confused by all the lights and buttons. Had to find out where everything was and what everything did before I put it into Drive. Things sure have changed since they made my 1991 Explorer.

Oh, my word, what a ride. Where did all those bumps in the road go to? So smooth I didn't even realize I was going 60 miles an hour in a 45 zone. It handles so easily, too.

The radio picked up stations I can't usually get, so that impressed me quite easily.

I was home before I knew it, so I got out and opened the trunk. Boy, could I pack some stuff in there. Much easier access than the Crown Vic, which was hard to fit large suitcases into easily.

Well, it was yesterday that I got to drive this home. My mechanic just called to say my Explorer is ready.

Sigh.

Time to go back to being SUV woman.
