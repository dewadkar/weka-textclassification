            Having driven multiple Mazda Products over the years, I was really looking forward to getting into one of these trucks. After reading good reviews for the introduction year, my wife and I placed an order in October of last year. Our Tribute was delivered as promised in January.

Exterior:
Compact and sporty. With the available Mazda appearance package, this SUV (made on the same line as the Ford Escape) looks far superior to the Ford counterpart - which sports an incredible amount of plastic trim. The Tribute is very sporty, without sacrificing a SUV appearance. A sleek design makes this a more attractive choice to the boxy Escape. We purchased the LX sport package which included the alloy wheels, fog lights, window tinting, and Sun roof. 

Interior and Controls:
I still do not understand the rationale behind the column shifter. The driver's compartment is well laid out, however the interior space overall is tight. Controls are all within easy reach of the driver.
We have had problems with the door trim coming off at times and the trim/insulation around the wind shield. Mazda took care of these problems immediately. I think that this can be attributed to the typical poor North American craftsmanship that keeps me from buying domestic products. It is my understanding that the Tribute's major downfall so far has been minor complaints such as this. 

Other Issues:
The engine is powerful enough to get the job done. Handling is fantastic. In fact the Tribute drives like a car. I have been very happy with this truck's handling capabilities in severe winter conditions as well as off road. Towing has been easy, and the vehicle does not seem underpowered in this regard.
My biggest complaint with the Tribute so far is the undersized gas tank. It seems as if I am constantly fueling up. This issue is compensated by the fact that the millage is very good for an SUV.
