            I've had my Y2K Grand Prix GTP for about two months now and I've put a little over 2500 miles on it.  My GTP is white four door with the graphite interior.  It has the 240 HP supercharged V-6, heads-up display, dual automatic A/C, CD player w/equalizer, and leather seats w/heated driver's seat.  I'm averaging a little over 22 miles per gallon and easily get more than 25 mpg on the highway.  The car is very solid and is very quiet at all speeds.  It's a joy to drive around town because of its light steering and terrific acceleration.  The ride is a little choppy due to its firm suspension and the leather seats are a bit hard, but I'm not complaining.  I'm a 49 year old who's going through his second childhood.  My wife has a '97 Chrysler Concorde with the 24 valve - 3.5 liter engine.  Her car feels heavy and sluggish compared to mine.  I love my Grand Prix GTP!<br><br>
