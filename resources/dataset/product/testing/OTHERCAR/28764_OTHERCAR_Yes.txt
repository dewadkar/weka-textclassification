            It's hard to do better than the Honda Prelude.  Maybe it's a little small if you're over 6', maybe it's a little noisy, but that's part of the point: the Prelude corners on rails and seems to rev to infinity.  That the interior is familiar to owners of 10 yr old Hondas is a little off-putting, but that speaks to iron-clad durability as well-- most of what might break has been fixed a decade ago.  And here's the kicker: in many parts of the country, the Prelude just doesn't sell.  So it's meat for the bargain hunter in the used car market.<br><br>
