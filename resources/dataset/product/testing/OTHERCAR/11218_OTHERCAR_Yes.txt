            We recently purchased our first minivan after a nightmare 2500 mile drive in our 4 door sedan.  After one test drive, a used 1998 T&C LXi was the only way to go for us.  With 73,000 miles on it, someone must have drove this van everywhere.  However, it still looks immaculate.  It's fully loaded with all the bells and whistles as highlighted in the other reviews.  The leather has held up wonderfully and the white exterior paint looks flawless for being 4 years old.  

Switching from a 2001 Mitsu Galant to the T&C has been very easy for me.  While I'm physically aware of the size of the van, I don't feel uncomfortable maneuvering on the road or in and out of my garage.  It'd be nice if the rear lift window had the option to open separately because we cannot close our garage door if we need to get in the cargo area.

My son seems to enjoy the ride also.  He's 1 year old and has a bird's eye view of his surroundings now.  The privacy glass is a blessing.  No more wimpy sun shades that never seemed to keep light out of his eyes anyway.

To be safe on the mechanical side, we've chosen to purchase a 3 year extended warranty while we finish paying for the van.  Hopefully all the "bugs" have been worked out by now and it'll be smooth sailing for us.
