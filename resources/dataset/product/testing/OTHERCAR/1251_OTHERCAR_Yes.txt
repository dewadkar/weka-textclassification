            Tips: Don't listen to sales people, don't get your inf. from late night TV, they don't know either. Go out test them out and talk with owners. Cross check site like www.pcphotoreview.com and www.megapixel.net it easy do it your self.

Everyone now is going digital! so am I. Well I am not too sure that they will one day replace a cassette video camcorder or replace our 35 millimeter camera. As those are hard copies will always been necessary to keep for backups. Digital cameras have own there pluses though and that's why I am going with one.

Well I don't have one yet but it is on my list. I am glad I haven't bought any other yet, but I have done an extensive research.

Only to find that those who sell these products don't know much about their product. This includes most of the stores I  investigated like bestbuy, frys and circuit city. Even our local TV station don't know most about products too, they don't bring the latest. They seem to try but they are more in a haste to cover more coverage on other news stuff. Plus the latest is always changing. Just figure out what you need from a cam and go with it.

Well I waited for my local TV station wb39 to bring me the latest on digital cams, only to find out that they thought that the memory stick did the magic of creating mpeg movies. For one memory stick is exclusively Sony's; and movie making is made possible by the camera and they are usually short in other to conserve space (mem).

Okay then, I choose the Nikon 990 after comparing online photos at various websites. I discovered that it was above average and focused on what digital cams are up to. It's dedicated to photo shooting and it does take photos quicker than most digital cameras around it's price range today. It's considered a point and shoot camera. It takes photos quicker than the canon G1, and the Sony P1. The movie is supposed to be smoother although it lacks sound ( why? I don't know). They should have put it in, having upgraded from the 880 coolpix. But the focus here is photo shooting or price vs. quality.

Another reason why I like this camera is because it uses a compact flash card with is very much compatible with today's pocket computers. If you go with a Sony, then you don't much options when it come to pocket computing. My top choices where the canon g1, Sony p1, 880 coolpix and 990 coolpix. I dropped all the others for various reasons (which include pictures quality, slow shutter and poor eye pieces respectively). The 990 CoolPix again seemed to be better.

In addition I like the way it makes up for the flip out view finders. It has a swivel body instead, so one can still take pics from various angles. I played with one at the store, that's one way one could learn. I was very close to buying the others; But after a few week I am happy to choose the 990 CoolPix.

Hope this helps. Be sure to check other reviews to make sure it the right for you. Details are available at their website.

It features a 3.34 mega pixels which is up today's standard, good for enlargement. They are higher Cameras though like to Fuji or Olympus but it's with a big price tag. Try three grand or four.

The eye piece of the 990 CoolPix is wide and the lens offer 4X digital. Another thing feature is that it does not project out when you zoom. It all internal so you don't have to be afraid of getting things in it's track. The lens is expandable to adapt to accessories like the fish eye and wide angle.

Check it out when you can, it's great cam. I can't wait to shoot someone (oh with the 990 coolpix). It's not a toy and it is not just cosmetics, I think I get more for my money.

happy choosing. Hope this helps
