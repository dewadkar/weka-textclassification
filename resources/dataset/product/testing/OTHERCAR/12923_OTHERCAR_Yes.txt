            Finally a teen age dream come true.  I recentley bought a 1993 Mercury Cougar, a car that when it was new, I could only dream of owning.  I was very excited to find this car especially with all the options. 

Its Cayman Green (teal) with tan full leather dual power seats. It has every option except for sunroof, anti-lock brakes and maintenance monitor.  The car when purchased only had 52,000 miles on it, now it has 71,000.  Overall I've been very happy with the car.  I must say that I have put quite a bit of money into it for repairs.  Of course I bought it at the mileage when things start to go wrong.  I had a $125 repair the same day I picked it up from the dealer, should have told me something, eh? Other than that I've had sway bar connectors replaced, fan clutch, radiator overhaul (after moving to Phoenix!), timing belt spring.  All these repairs totalled about $1000 over about 1 year.  Other things were regular maintenance such as tires, brakes, spark plugs, etc.  I can't say its unreliable because I don't think it is, I just got it at the wrong time!

As for comfort, the car is good.  I just drove it from Iowa to Phoenix and was comfortable the whole 1600 miles.  The seats being leather do tend to make you sweat when not using the A/C but are generally supportive and have worn well. There is plenty of room in the front but the back seat has horrible leg and foot room.  Once you get in the back you're ok, but getting there is a chore!  

Power is outstanding, I have the optional 5.0 V8, fairly rare on the 91-93 Cougars.  It has 200 hp and moves EXTREMELY well.  I've been able to out run most every car, even gave a Mustang 5.0 a run for his money!  It has a wonderful growl just like the older Mustangs, but without the exhaust noise.  Highway cruising is very quiet with great passing power.  Gas mileage is great on the highway, I was getting about 25 mpg on my road trip but around town it guzzles!  The transmission shifts smoothly except for the overdrive which really clunks especially when hovering at  speeds where it engages/disengages frequently.  I've heard of transy problems but don't think mine is really in need of repair.  

Fit and finish is ok.  The paint on my front bumper is peeling but the rest of the car is perfect, shiny as when it was new.  Interior is fine though some screws keep coming out, nothing major.  The leather is good quality but its fairly stiff, not as soft as the Mark VIII leather, but it was also about 20K cheaper too!

The Cougar/Thunderbirds are not very practical, but who wants a practical coupe?  I would recommend more the newer Cougars (94-97) because they have the newer engine and dual air bags but if you're in the market for a good older used car, the 93 is a good choice.  Just make sure you have it checked out by a mechanic first!  You can't beat the styling of the Cougar, it always catches attention and the acceleration is awesome with the V8.  I plan on keeping my cat for a while, though I wish she wasn't so thirsty!
