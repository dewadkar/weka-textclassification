            I brought this vehicle, I thought I was getting a good vehicle but I was wrong. I should have done my home work this was my first mini-van. It a was used 93MPV 30.000km that's 18.641mi when we brought it then around 75.000km the transmission went 2000.00 canadain dollars to get that fixed now at 100.000km the engine needs work the valves knocks real bad when you first starts in the morning i&quot;m still making payments on the van that's where it hurt's I'm still making payments. On a lemon I'll do my home work next time I buy a vehicle.And another thing all that money I'm paying it dosen't even come with a roof rack, and they still don't. That's what I hate about this vehicle. When everything works it drives o.k. If you buy this vehicle I recommend do your home work and make them put a roof rack on it, ask about the transmission and, the engine my warranty ran out.I wont buy another MPV.Make sure you get a good warranty! NO ROOF RACK! My next vehicle will be a Lexus SUV and I'll bet you the transmission won't go before 100,000km.You get what you pay for.I should't say I hate this van it's o.k. but I'll never buy another one.<br><br>
