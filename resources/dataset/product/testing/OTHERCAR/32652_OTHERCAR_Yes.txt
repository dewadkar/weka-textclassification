            I bought the Cherokee 18 months ago from a retired man who drove it once a week to the dock down the block to go fishing. When I got it, (with about 70k miles on it) it was in mint condition. Even now after all I've put it through it's still going strong. The only major complaint I have involves the ABS system. 

It was, if not the first, one of the first ABS systems in these trucks, so it had a lot of problems since the technology was so new. There was a recall on some of the components, but the guy never knew about them. Since he didn't drive it that much, these parts never got to the point where they were failing. So by the time I had gotten it the "10yr 100k mile" limit had expired (by 2 months); and these parts that were recalled were just started to act up. GREAT. So that ran me a few hundred dollars, and now instead of the ABS pump humming at every stop, it hums every 3 stops (as it should). But unless the radio is on, you hear it, and it's annoying.

Besides that I really have no complaints. I love it. The only things I've replaced is the alternator, and drive belt.

It does have a weak rear end. A friend of mine works on these at a local dealership, and told me he does 3-4 rears a day. (Thatï¿½s a lot.) What happens exactly is after a lot of miles, the gears in the differential (splits the power from drive shaft to the two back wheels) wear, and need to be replaced with new gears, and also be professional reset. The keyword here is professionally, this is not a job for the average do-it-yourselfer. (I've seen some pictures of the aftermath that doing it yourself can produce, it's not a pretty sight) This can cost you anywhere from $500 to $800. He told me that the average mileage (a truck not abused offroad) is 120k and up. **A note to anyone who might be considering a suspension lift; some of these trucks have a C8.25" rear oppose to the D35c, which is bad news for drive train angle problems. The 35c is preferred. (Of course the D44 is superior  to both.)

I lifted it recently and put larger tires on (31") and in my opinion the ride is twice as good. It 4 wheels great, I take it on the beach all the time. I've been forced to put it up for sale recently, and it broke my heart. Tonight is one of the last nights I'm going to have it, and I took it on the beach and took some pictures [http://www.geocities.com/billbennett97/SunsetJeepJan01.jpg]. Later that night I emailed some of the pictures to friends, and posted some on an offroad webpage, and I realized that this is what some people do with their kids, and I'm doing it with my truck. What can I say? I love it.
