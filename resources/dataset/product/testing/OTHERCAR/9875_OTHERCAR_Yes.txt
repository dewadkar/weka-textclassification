            Pontiac has been working hard to improve its cars.  A weekend drive in a rented Sunfire reminds one of just how far they have to go.  Sunfires not withstanding, new Pontiacs are indeed improving.  The Bonneville is a worthy competitor in the mid-size segment, and what the Montana lacks in finesse, it makes up for in sheer utility. 
 
Little is new for the 2001 Grand Am. A bit of fine-tuning in the chassis dept. nets the Grand Am high marks in rigidity (25 hertz).  That is on par with numbers generated by makes such as Cadillac and BMW.  What this means for the buyer, is a smoother quieter ride than previous Pontiacs of this size.  Also the Grand Am drops the SE2 model in favor of a 4-model line-up with the options most buyers want.

On the outside, the Grand Am GT looks aggressive and sporty.  The deep front air dam with driving lights, rear spoiler and 16 in. alloy wheels all work together to make the Grand Am GT  look like a mini-Bonneville SSEi. The coupe is by FAR the better looking Grand Am. As cool as the rear spoiler looks, it does cut down on visibility.

Inside the Grand Am, the typical Pontiac theme is found.  Round gauges and more dash lights than a jet fighter make the driver feel like a Formula 1 racer even in rush hour traffic.  The low-slung seats could be distracting to some - visibility is not the Grand Am's strong point.  Luckily the power seats have a height adjustment, drivers shorter than 5'10" will be thankful for this, also tall drivers can be thankful for the ability to lower the seat, making it possible to opt for the sunroof, and still get plenty of head room. Rear seat room is good; expect 2 adults to ride comfortably for about three hours or longer.  Rear headroom is excellent - this car feels bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.  Although the rear seats have a split fold down function, they are awkward to use.  Folding the rear seats down requires opening the trunk and pulling a strap.  Many cars have this function, but it is usually in addition to a release inside the car.  If you need to fold the back seat down, and it happens to be raining, you will not be happy. The Grand Am has lots of storage space up front and boasts an overall functionality not found on cars like the Toyota Corolla or Dodge Stratus. The Grand Am's Monsoon stereo is among the best of any car in its class.

On the road the Grand Am GT performs well, it should, Pontiac has long been the performance division of GM.  The GT gives you a cold-air, forced induction 3400 V-6 producing 175 hp (5 more hp than a V-6 SE).  Not bad for a car that is fairly compact.  By comparison a 4 cylinder Camry (a bigger car) makes 150 hp and a non-turbo VW Beetle makes 150 as well.  The Grand Am GT is not as refined as other small cars, but the punch of the V-6 reminds the driver that this is no econo-box.  The powerful V-6 has a bit of a growl to it, especially under full throttle.  This could be a drawback for anyone used to the serenity of a Corolla, Camry or Accord.  Handling is tight and precise and there is little body roll or lean under hard cornering.  Brakes are firm and stop the Grand Am quickly.  At highway speeds the Grand Am is quiet.  Surprising is the lack of road noise at highway speeds.  Most GM cars this size are terribly noisy at speeds above 55 mph.  Barely worth mentioning is the 4 cylinder version of the Grand Am.  It is harsh, noisy and underpowered (150 hp).  
Anyone considering this car should stick to the GT.   The GT offers $1500 worth of options for about $850. With additions like a 175 hp V-6, 4 wheel discs and Goodyear RSA P225/50R16 tires, the money is well spent. 
 
On the down side:  Typically weak warranty is 3 years / 36,000 miles- and that is it.  Pontiac does offer a comprehensive roadside assistance program, but stillï¿½  Oldsmobile is offering a 5 year /60,000 mile warranty to encourage buyers to buy.  If Olds can do it, Pontiac can do it.  Pontiac reliability is still a bit of a question mark.  Other GM division's rank higher on JD Power's initial quality survey, but Pontiac generally incorporates new technology and electronics, which usually cause more problems for owners.

Overall, the Grand Am is a reasonably competent car.  With its bold styling, the Grand Am GT seems to appeal more to young men.  The racy image is backed up with a powerful V-6, improved sport suspension, and 16-inch wheels.  The Grand Am GT is to sport what the Toyota Corolla is to reliability.  The Grand Am is for someone who has about $22K to spend and wants to stand out a little.  When comparing the Grand Am GT to other cars:  Think of the Grand Am and a small car for a hot-rodder at heart, where a Ford Focus is for the web designer at heart.
