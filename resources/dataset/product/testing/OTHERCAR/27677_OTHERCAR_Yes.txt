            In answer to questions and comments received about the MVC DC1000 I have written a second opinion on the product.  Please refer to my earlier review for more details  <a href='/./elec-review-755F-4998A974-3A56759E-prod3'>http://www.epinions.com/./elec-review-755F-4998A974-3A56759E-prod3</a>.


Is the camera easy enough for a 15 year old to use? 
About how long does it take for someone that young to learn it?

You know, it's my experience that the younger folks pick up a lot faster than an older guy like me when it comes to electronics.
 
It helps to have a little bit of knowledge about cameras because this digital has many functions that standard film cameras have - exposure settings, fStop settings, etc.  Knowing what you need to do with these helps speed up your acclimation to the camera.
 
Of course, if you spend a day practicing with it you'll figure out most of what you need.


Would it be a good camera for a trip to Europe?

The instructions are pretty clear, and there is a section on using the camera overseas.  Unfortunately I don't have them here.  From what I recall, the only real concern is with being able to recharge the batteries.  Of course, these batteries need to be recharged with DC power, 120 volt.  Contact Sony or go to the Sony site, I'm sure there is some information on use overseas.


Is it worth the money?

Speaking of batteries, get an extra one or two.  They cost $60 each but its worth it to have on hand.  The batteries do last for a while, but you don't want to be caught short.
 
Check the internet for prices.  Go to zdnet.com.  They have a search mechanism that gets you the top 25 or so sites selling the product.  We bought it at AMDV.com for $1,039.  A local shop was selling it for $1,299.  Big savings.  With that extra money we bought a case, an extra battery, and a set of three lens filters (a must!).  Later you can purchase a wide angle lens.  You won't need the telephoto extender as the camera comes equipped with a 10x optical zoom (and a 20x digital zoom).


Do you have some sample images you could send me?

I don't have samples to send you.  I was forced to loan the camera out to one of our engineers who has left town for two weeks.  Besides, the images I took were experimental.


Does the camera take good pictures at night? Other conditions?

I can tell you one thing, though.  The camera has incredible low light capabilities.  I took several shots where I could see very little in the frame and the picture (using a flash) came out looking pretty good (if a bit &quot;warm&quot;).  One shot I took I couldn't see anything in the viewfinder but got a pretty good picture anyway.  The subject of the image was clear and not too &quot;hot&quot; from the flash.
 
These are certainly not circumstances you want to duplicate, but it's good to know the camera has that range of capabilities.
 
Someone who reviewed the camera on zdnet.com mentioned that the camera is not good for sporting events.  I think that with careful adjustment of exposure, fStop, and shutter speed you will be able to get some action shots.  I just haven't experimented with it yet.  
 
When the camera comes back I'll be confiscating it and experimenting more.


Recommendation

Bottom line is the camera is worth the expense for our needs.  I could not buy it for home use, although I wish I could.  There are higher resolution cameras on the market, but most of us don't need the professional photographer quality digitals - which can cost $10K or more.  This is a perfect high end consumer model.  While it will come down in price in three years, do you really want to wait?  Because by that time something new will be out.  At some point you just have to jump on the electronics merry-go-round.  It's like that with computers, stereos, etc. 
 
The big deciding factor for us was the ease of image storage and retrieval.  We have a lot of potential users for the camera.  Being able to simply remove the CDR and pop it into any CD-equipped computer is too handy a function to pass up.  Add to that our positive experience with two other Sony Mavicas, chosing the CD1000 was really a no-brainer.
 
Hope this helps you.

If I could figure out how to bold or underline, this opinion would have been a little easier to read!!!<br><br>
