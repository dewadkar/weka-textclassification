            The three safest minivans are the Sienna, Odyssey and Windstar.  Since the Windstar, at least according to Consumers, isn't as reliable, that left me two choices.  In my area (NJ), both vans were in short supply. I drove both the Sienna and the Odyssey and could have been happy with either.  Quite frankly, since the pricing and availability seem to vary by region, buy whichever has more value for the money.

What drove me to Toyota, was Honda's arrogance.  First, most dealers didn't even have one available for a test drive.  After, I finally found one to test, I was told the price.  Forget negotiating, it was $2,000 over list price!  And even then they nickeled and dimed me to death--oh, you mean you want a tape player...

The Toyota was much easier to buy, was delivered within a two weeks, and I felt like I got value for my money.  While I would have liked the fold down seat of the Honda, I know that the occasions when I would have actually folded them down are few and far between.  Instead, I got an LX, with pretty much the works.  I just couldn't spend the extra money for the XLE's leather seats and moon roof.  I did get the package that has the captain's chairs, which are great, especially since I have two kids in car seats. 

For me the best part is the automatic door.  I still get a kick out of pressing the button on the remote and having the door open.  And it is great in bad weather, especially with kids.  The only drawback is parking--I can't parallel park it to save my life.
