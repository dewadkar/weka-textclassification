            A month ago I bought the Volvo C70 Convertible and absolutely love it.  The model I purchased has the automatic transmission and several options - top-end stereo,  full leather seats, auto-dimming mirrors and fancy 17&quot; wheels.

I find the car is beautiful to look at, especially with the top down.  It's inline-5 engine (weird!) is lively, and downright dangerous to the driving record at higher speeds; the car in general drives very nicely.  The stereo is a total joy and performs well with the top up or down.  The mechanics of the car (including the roof mechanism) are all first rate.  The seats are extremely comfortable.

There are some things that do bother me a bit about the car.  The most irritating one: visibility with the top up is very bad.  When backing out of a parking spot, you're almost blind.  I've seen this problem in many other convertibles, but it's been fixed by Mercedes in part by providing side windows in the back of the retractable roof.  A couple of other minor points:  The auto-dim mirror is lower than the back window opening and thus never has light hitting it directly and never dims.  Get the regular rear-view mirror.  Also the seats are both totally electric and moving a seat up to let someone in the back is a slow process.  Not a big deal, just an annoyance.

Overall, I love this car!<br><br>
