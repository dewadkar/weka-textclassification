            No doubt you are reading this review for one of two reasons.  Either you've had an interest in buying a digital camera for quite awhile and can't decide which one....or perhaps you're one of those kind souls here who reads my reviews when you come across them.  Either way, I'm VERY glad you've clicked through because I've got a bold statement to share with you today:

<b>The best piece of electronic equipment I've <i>ever</i> owned is the Sony Mavica digital camera, Model MVC-FD83</b>.

That type of statement so early in a review may take you off guard.  You may be wondering why this particular writer didn't save that as his closing argument after a long and elaborate recitation.  Surely he wouldn't make that statement without a bit of build-up?

Well, the truth is that I read over 50 reviews here at Epinions before I finally decided to buy the Sony Mavica.  And after that type of time consuming reading, I decided that being forthright early on has its advantages.

Why is that?  Well, if it is the first review you've read on the subject, then you'll probably read the review thoroughly from start to finish.  If it's the tenth review you've perused, you'll probably scan the review and see if this writer adds anything you haven't already learned.  And if it's the fiftieth, you'll have glazed over eyes and will be looking for the bolded highlights.

Okay - now you probably want to know <i>why</i> I'm so infatuated with my Sony Mavica.  Two words sum up the tale.  <i><b>Instant gratification</i></b>.  The magical ability to take a photo of a subject and see it immediately on a two-inch LCD screen.  And then the even nicer option of taking a standard floppy disk out of the camera and <b>immediately</b> having access to it on a computer screen.  And finally, the distinct pleasure to sending - via email - that same high quality image to a distant relative within one minute of its creation.

Yes - I know that the Sony Mavica is expensive versus the competition out there.  If you're into measuring megapixels - <i>those dots that determine the quality of a digital photo</i> - then the Sony costs twice as much as many of its competitors on that front.  But the Sony has something that none of the other guys offers.  <i>No cables and no special software needed to &quot;decode&quot; the photo</i>.  No expensive memory flash cards.  No delay from any intermediary that would prevent you from enjoying your camera - and the photos it produces.

Hey - <i>what do you intend to do with your camera?</i>  If you're a professional photographer who is planning to sell your product, then this is not your camera.  If you're on a very tight budget, then this is not your camera.  If you want super clear printed shots that match 35mm point and shoot cameras - probably in the 3 plus megapixel range - then this is not your camera.

But if you are an average consumer with enough disposable income to indulge yourself occasionally - then this is YOUR camera.  If you like to share your photos with your relatives via email - then this is YOUR camera.  And if you like minimum hassle when you take and retrieve your amateur photos - then this is YOUR camera.  

And - by the way - this particular model is being discontinued by Sony to make room for even more fully featured Mavicas being released this quarter.  So you can find it &quot;on clearance&quot; at many of the electronics retailers.  Try Staples if you're lucky enough to have one around your neighborhood.  They have a policy of discounting the last unit of any discontinued digital camera in their inventory by 30 percent.  Thus a list price of $599 becomes a much more reasonable $419.  Cheaper than the FD73 model that has less features.

Speaking of features, this Sony has more than enough to satisfy the typical user.  It features three image size settings - with a maximum of 1216 x 912.  It has two resolutions - standard and fine.  I've found that the standard setting delivers crisp photos on screen and does not create such large digital files for sharing.  About 8 to 9 shots per floppy at the medium image size setting.  The standard setting coupled with the lowest quality resolution (640 x 480) allows you to squeeze almost 20 photos on each floppy.  And yes - floppies have come way down in cost.  You can pick up a pack of 50 floppies for about $12 on average - or about 25 cents each.  Sure is cheaper than a roll of film...and of course there's NO developing costs.

So - if you're still with me - here's how to justify this purchase.  Let's assume you take a roll of film per month.  The film will cost you about $2 or so a roll.  The developing will run anywhere from $5 to $10, depending on how many copies of each print you desire.  And then there's the cost of gas - ouch - these days for the two trips to the developer.  So the out of pocket cost for you is probably over $10 per roll.  Throw in the cost of running to Kinkos to get some photos scanned to send to your family and friends...and you're looking at close to $15 combined.

$400 divided by $15 equals approximately 26 rolls of film - about two years of shots for the average user.  That's your breakeven point - and then every shot after that is gravy.  No additional costs.  And the battery is rechargeable and gives you a full day of shooting if you are taking candid shots on vacation.  Less if you decide to use the Sony mpeg motion picture capability built in that delivers a twenty second movie per floppy.  And using the built in zoom (6x) will also drain the battery somewhat more quickly.

The quality of the final photo?  <i>Superb</i>.  To an untrained eye, it is virtually impossible onscreen to denote any degradation of detail versus a 35mm shot.  And using one of the online photo services like Ofoto.com produced outstanding prints from this camera.  And yes - it even offers a neat self timer so you too can get into the photo.  

Okay, okay.  You get the idea.  Oh - one more thing.  I took the equivalent of twenty rolls of film the first <i>week</i> I had this camera.  More photos than I've ever taken in my life.  And they were crystal clear... they printed wonderfully...and the camera itself was so easy to use that anyone I handed it to could use it within ten seconds.  In fact, every person who has taken photos with it - friends, strangers, even teenagers - have uttered basically the same thing when handing it back:

  &quot;Your new camera is really cool.&quot;

One final time for emphasis.  No ifs....and no buts.  No hesitation before I type these words.  <i>This is the <b>BEST</b> electronics item I've <b>ever</b> owned.</i>  <br><br>
