            I own a 1996 Dodge Caravan. I love the room this vehicle affords me but I am disappointed with the problems I have faced with this car. First of all I have had continual problem with my air condition system. It seems that Chrylser hasn't been able to make a evaporator that doesn't leak. As a result my A/C has been in the shop 4 times for repairs. I have spoken with Chrysler but they refuse to recognize the problem. After searching recall boards I found that the Chrysler Intrepid was recalled for the evaporator leaking......this is the same part that is in the Dodge Caravan but alas no recall. There must be a problem because Chrysler offered to replace the part at no charge BUT the labor cost was my responsibility! This was a steep bill!!! Chrysler should stand behind the products they build! Let's see what happens, yesterday my Transmission went!<br><br>
