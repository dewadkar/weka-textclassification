            My husband and I own a Suzuki Swift.   My husband bought it because he drives 65 miles one way to work every day.  He was sure that it would last like my Honda, and that it would give good gas mileage. WRONG on both counts.  The Suzuki is a 1994.  My Honda had over 100,000  miles on it and it still got better gas mileage than that Suzuki does.  Also we have put in a new engine and it needs a new transmission now and we are still making payments on it.  

It is tiny and uncomfortable.  It is made for two people only. The back seat is just for looks.  The seats tTilt so much that they cause me a great deal of back pain.  In fact I can not ride more than ten to fifteen miles in it.  It sets low so it is very difficult for some people to get in and out of it.  

The only good thing about this car is that it is easy to find a parking place.  It is so small you can park it anywhere.  

The long and short of it is I will never buy another one. I wish with all of my heart we had not bought this one.  Give me my Honda any day.
