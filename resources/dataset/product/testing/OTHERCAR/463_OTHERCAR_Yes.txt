            Well, this is my first new car. I bought this in March of 2000.I have had several &quot;klunkers&quot; in the past, but I decided it was time for a car with a warranty (and monthly payments). 

This car is affordable for the name brand and features included.We are a chevy family and I have always loved the sporty Monte Carlo body style; even the early 80's. 

I drove passed the chevy place (like I do everyday to college or work) and they had this pewter car with aluminum wheels sitting in &quot;THE&quot; spot. You know, the spot where the special cars go to catch your eye. I test drove this car and immediately fell in love. Since this is my first new car, everything about this car is better than my old vehicles. My friends' cars are less comfortable than this one. I am excited to actually go places. 

But, see,  there are disadvantages to this car (besides higher insurance and a car payment). The passenger side has no leg room. =( I am very short an have problems when I ride over there. I don't want to gripe to much about this car for fear of turning people from buying one. 

Overall, this is a great car. The brakes work great and the acceleration, well, keeps up with my lead foot. This is the LS model with the V6 motor. All I have to say is take time out of your busy schedule and test drive one. <br><br>
