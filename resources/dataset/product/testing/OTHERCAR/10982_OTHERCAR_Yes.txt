            What a pleasure this car is.  I have owned 10 Miatas starting with a 90 and the last being a 99. The amount of standard equipment is mind boggling for a Miata. 16" wheels that are light and the best looking wheels since the BBS on the early 90's special and M editions. Performance rubber too. The fog lights, the Nardi leather steering wheel, plus A/C,P/W, P/S, P/B, remote power mirrors, one touch down, driver side power window, and the front shock tower brace make the BASE model all the more irresistable.  In previous years all this stuff was extra cost.
Now lets get to the driving part. Tossable, but controllable. Take a quick corner--you bet. FUN---oh yes.
Top down--all the time (I do live in Hawaii). Top up-boo!  but if necessary about 2 seconds up and latched in another 5. Autocross?--put another 7-10 lbs in the tires and you're starting line ready.  POWER-- yes the 03 has 142HP and a little more torque than the previous years--and it is readily noticeable in the ease of driving- but we're not talking quantum leaps here. The car is quick, and supple, but not stiff. It has the base suspension-not the bilsteins, but with the standard issue I love the ride. Just took a ride in a new 350Z with the leather and optional 18" wheels and the ride just killed me--just too harsh. Back to the Miata.
 The solidity, partly due to the shock tower brace, is way improved from the original as is the ride and the general feel, though, you can definitely see the lineage.
The engine revs to red line with authority that lights up a smile on your face and the gear shift in your hand with that "snick-snick" that's just Sweet.
Always in control, you feel the car--usually going slower than you feel--which obviously is a good thing today.
Maintenance--just the minimum like all the other Miatas I've had.  
One other nicety-- this is a non threatening vehicle--no airs, no image, ---just a 2-way smile machine.
...and the dealers are dealing!  Got this one for $3300.under MSRP. Rebates! God love em. I like a motto from one of the after market suppliers-- food, drink, shelter, miata!
