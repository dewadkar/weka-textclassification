            The great styling of the new Pt Cruiser goes a long way to attract everyone to the car. It has a personality of it's own, which many new cars don't. The vehicle is a front engine, front wheel drive, 5 passenger, 5 door wagon, but not like the the old wagoneer that your dad would take you and ma' to the old camp grounds in. It has a completely retro-refined look, with a nice little power train, 4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes and a relatively comfortable interior and for a base price  of 17,730$ it is a devilishly smooth and worth it. The engine comes from the dodge minivan, a 2.4 liter,16 valve DOHC that produces 150 horse power and 162 pound feet of torque. Even though the performance was good for the type of car it is I still feel that it could use  a 6 cylinder engine.<br><br>
