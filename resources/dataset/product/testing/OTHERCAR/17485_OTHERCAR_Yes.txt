            I have to say that this van is a great value and we went for it!

We had been shopping around for another vehicle and we had settled between the Hyundai Sante Fe and the Kia Sedona.  My wife and I both commute over 30 miles one way to work and we wanted the comfort of a really good warranty.  Well, Kia and Hyundai are the main cars with great warranties!

I really had my heart set on the Sante Fe but I had received an email from a local dealer that Kia was going on sale with a sales rebate offer.  That is what motivated me to buy the Kia.  

I knew that the one thing I wanted as a must, and that was it had to be black.  Kia is THE ONLY minivan in black!!  Wierd.  

My first experience with one of the two local Kia dealers was a major waste of my time.  I waited almost 30 minutes before I had to ask a salesperson to see a Sedona.  He tossed a set of keys and said the blue one out side.  Needless to say I left....quickly!  But they were the ones with the great pricing.  So I called our other Kia dealer and explained to them the "wonderful" customer service I received with the other dealership and I that I was still interested in purchasing a Sedona.  He was more than willing to assist us and he also had the black Sedona I wanted.  

We chose the EX with the leather pkg.  I wanted the quad seating arrangements as I have 2 small boys.  We currently have the Dodge Grand Caravan as well and the boys tend to fight sitting next to each other on long rides. 

Our Kia Sedona has a ton more options(including homelink and leather) and was $6,000 less than our Dodge Grand Caravan! (Not to mention all the the storage nooks and crannies!  Unlike the Dodge.) 

I took out the rear seats to experiment and the middle two seats tend to slide on their gliders while you are adjusting them during their removal/insertion.  This tends to be a bit awkward but with practice becomes easier.  It's not like I need to remove them every day.  I have a herniated disk and did not have any difficulties removing the seats.  My wife was able to carry the larger rear seats out herself also without difficulties. 

If you are looking around, seriously consider this van!  You won't regret it.  Just call ahead to your local dealership and spend most of the time on the phone and you won't waste time on a dealers lot!  Walk in knowing you will meet with someone and they have already spotted the car you are looking for!  

Good luck and have fun driving!!  I know we will!


~~Review Update October 6, 2002~~


We are still enjoying our Van!  I have had a small problem with the front tires bouncing.  I have taken it back to the dealer and they have rotated and balanced tires at no charge.  I thought that this was the issue but I think that one of the front tires has a blown steel belt.  I do have to take it back and have re-checked.  I will keep this situation posted.  I believe it to be a tire issue and will see about the warranty replacing them.

We have recently purchased a travel trailer and use this van to pull it.  Ours is a 17' hybrid travel trailer.  It has solid walls like a normal trailer, but has fold out beds like a pop up.  It weighs 2500 lbs and the van pulls it effortlessly!  I was so pleased at how nice it pulled the camper.  I had owned a pick up truck prior to this van and I like the handling of this van better when towing.  The option of shutting off the overdrive makes it easier on the transmission.  

We also have had to replace a windshield due to the "infamous" run away rock.  The only problem with the replacement was the company doing the replacing did not have the appropriate trim to reinstall the window with.  We just rescheduled for another day.  But they did replace the window with factory equipment.  I was very pleased.  

The van continues to run smoothly.  I have used the rear heater and it works great!  The kids really like getting the heat in the back. (Compared to our Dodge Grand Caravan which doesn't have rear heat/ac.)  

We have received multiple survey requests from KIA about our van.  We have filled them all out and mailed them back.  They seem to constantly strive to better their product and rely on us to help them achieve their goals.

I would continue to highly recommend this vehicle.  I show it off to many people. They are always curious to the quality of vehicle that KIA can produce.  They usually turn their heads at the name until they see the product and then are amazed...  So to those who are predisposed to the stereotypical analogies of KIA, I chuckle.  I truly feel like we have found a hidden secret.  And to those of you who are seriously shopping for a new van...I say go for it..you will not be disappointed.  KIA is working very hard to get your business and to obtain a good reputation.  Soon they will realize that they have a place in this market and will begin to raise their prices...just like LEXUS!
