            We were given a great deal on our 1995 Silhouette. I had wanted a mini van, but was looking at other models. This one fell into our lap. We have experience relatively few problems with the van. We did have problems with the sliding door popping back open. We found that the track simply needed to be cleaned out. We have had no problems with it an almost 8 months. The only major repair so far has been replacing one of the distributer caps. It cost less than $50. (One person told us we had to replace all three. They just wanted more money. My husband was able to do this repair easily.) We have found a short in the windshield wiper system. Only the front wipers are affected. I love this van. I was shocked to see all the problems other people have had. <br><br>
