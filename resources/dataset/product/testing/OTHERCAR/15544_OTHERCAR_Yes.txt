            I�ll admit it. I have a definite bias for American-made cars. I�m especially partial to cars that are made in my hometown�Lansing, Michigan. This despite the fact that I�m a Saturn owner.

When given the choice between a Mitsubishi, a Pontiac, or an Oldsmobile at the rental car place this past summer, the choice was pretty easy. The Olds Alero is a car made in Lansing, it has to be good, right? Of course, right.

Overall, I was very pleased with how fun the 2001 Oldsmobile Alero was to drive. I was on a business trip that had me flying in to Greenville, South Carolina and then driving to Columbia, Atlanta, back to Greenville, and then into North Carolina over a week�s period. So I spent a lot of time in this rental car and really got to put it through a workout.

The Alero handled well. It was so much easier to turn and maneuver than the SUV we rented earlier this summer while in Chicago. 

I was due for a quick disappointment when I first got the car. I knew I�d be spending a lot of time in the car, so I had packed several books on tape to bring down with me. (My commute time at home is 10 minutes, so listening to them at home is pretty pointless.) I got in the car and was ready to pop in the first tape when I discovered there was no tape player, only a CD player. Darn those modern technologies.

The car I drove was a very comfortable one with four doors, electronic locks and windows, and automatic lights. I was pleased with the gas mileage. I was able to drive from Greenville to Columbia to Augusta on 3/4s of a tank.

The car had plenty of conveniences. It had four cup holders, a map holder, a trip meter, and lap belts in the back. I was a little surprised that the lap belts weren�t passive restraints, but there were airbags. Personally, I prefer the automatic lap belts. 

I was a little surprised to see that the speedometer went up to 140 mph. Why? I can�t imagine where in public highways it would be legal or safe to drive 140 mph so why encourage some reckless teenager to push the car that high? I had to make great use of the cruise control because the car felt about the same whether it was going 45 mph or 80 mph and I found myself inadvertently speeding too many times for comfort.

Two other complaints that I had about the vehicle were the air conditioning controls and the sight lines. The air conditioning controls were a little too complex. I suppose once you�ve had a car for several months the controls become easier to use, but I thought they required too much attention for minor adjustments. I was grateful, though, that the car cooled off very quickly as both South Carolina and Georgia were very hot the week in July that I visited. The sight lines also took some adjusting. The seats were high and comfortable and the dashboard was rounded, leaving less of the window free. It took me about two hours worth of driving before I was able to adjust my seating and windows so that I was comfortable with how much of traffic I was able to see.

Those are relatively minor complaints, however, Overall, I was sad to have to turn the car in when my week�s trip was over. If I were in the market for a four-door sedan, the Alero would definitely be right up there with the Saturn on the list of cars I�d be interested in.
