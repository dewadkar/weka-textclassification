            I have always wanted a Toyota.  I have researched autos since I was a child trying to pick my &quot;dream&quot; car for when I grew up and had enough money to buy one.  While most kids wanted their Porshces or Ferraris, I wanted a Toyota.  Last year, I finally gave in and bought a new car.  I started off with a Toyota Rav4 (Check out that opinion for my astounding story.  It still gives me the shakes...  The car saved my LIFE.).

My Camry LE was not only cost effective for me, but affordable, comfortable, feature rich with a decent amount of hauling capability.  I was impressed by the quality of the factory installed stereo CD/tape player and 6 speaker audio system.  The acceleration with the dual overhead cams is fantastic, too.  Perhaps the greatest feature, though, is how safe I feel inside of it.  

Mind you, this does not mean I feel like I can drive like a maniac (check out the Rav4 story), but I generally feel safe inside the car.  As it is, I was already rear-ended once and my car suffered a ruined rear bumper, while the person that hit me sustained a completely totalled front end.  The engine landed nearly in her lap!  I left the scene completely uninjured.  The bumper work was relatively minor, yet costly (Thank you insurance!).

Would I buy another Camry, since my lease is half over?  Probably.  I have my eye on some other cars, including the Toyota Land Rover and the Dodge Intrepid, but I would seriously consider buying another Camry.  

It makes good sense.<br><br>
