            I have had my 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24 for about 1 and ï¿½ years. It has and is still a very dependable car. I bought it brand new and now have 24,345 miles on it.

The Z24 has a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a 150 hp. It comes with a four-speed automatic transmission. It will go from 0 to 55 in about 6 to 7 seconds.

My gas mileage if I drive it normal is about 23 MPG for city driving and 31 MPG when I am on the interstate. Gas mileage is less when I drive it hard.

The price was $18, 145 and I talked them down to $16,899 with tax included.

It is two doors, bright red in color with a sporty spoiler on the back.

It rides pretty good and has a lot of get up and go. The back seats are kind of close and would not be good for big people.

It has dual air bags in the front for protection of the driver and passenger.  Bucket seat up front and they are comfortable.

The Z24 has anti-lock brakes that do a nice job on stopping the car.

It has a nice AM/FM CD player with four speakers that put out a great sound.

The windows are power windows and it has power door locks. I love the power door locks, with the wireless remote key you can also open up the trunk or sound the horn.

It goes to the shop every three months for an oil change and has never been to the shop for anything else.

I am only 24 years old and this is my sports car.
