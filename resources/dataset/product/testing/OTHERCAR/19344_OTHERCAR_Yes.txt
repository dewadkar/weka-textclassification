            When I first saw the 2001 I30 I became extremely frenzied and ecstatic.  For real!  Before I passed out with joy, my friends told me I was frothing
 at the mouth and mumbling incoherently.  But seriously, I had fallen in love at first sight with the newly redesigned Infiniti I30.  And the more you know, the better this luxury sedan becomes...

<b>Styling</b>
Like I implied above, I really like the new look Infiniti gave to their mid-sized sedan.  The headlights have a sharper, clearer look to them; more so than the old model I30.  And along with the unmistakable grill, the front-end retains the elegance and power that Infiniti is known for.  The tail lights are also redesigned with more curves, and appear bright and clear in the day and at night.  The gentle slope of the hood and trunk also preserve Infiniti's conservative design, yet at the same time hint that there is more to the I30 than meets the eye.  Overall, the new I30 will definitely catch the attention of friends, family, and automobile connoisseurs alike.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of the I30 easily competes as one of the most comfortable and  splendid in its market.  When I first sat down I immediately noticed the roominess and feel of the seats, both front and back.  The windshield and back and side windows give a clear and uninhibited view of the outside, making the cabin seem oven larger than it is.  I ride in the old model I30 frequently and still marvel at the leg room, especially in the front passenger seat.  The new I30, however, has even more room for your feet and legs, giving you space to kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride.  The controls and console are easy to read and very clear.  The trunk space is also roomy, about enough to carry three golf bags or two good sized adults.  Kidding!  And along with a 200-watt Bose sound system (which I might add can produce a MaSSive amount of bass) the I30 is one huge audio powerhouse.

<b>Driving the I30</b>
The 227-horsepower V6 engine produces a whole lot of power and its all under your control, you lucky thing!  Acceleration is like a dream, especially while you're trying to get up to speed on freeway onramps.  The quick jump the I30 gives even presses you back in your seat, which provides a fun driving experience for the driver and passenger.  At high or low speeds the I30 performs well, with excellent handling on the street or freeway.  The turning radius is also very tight (about 35 feet or so) which I found very useful when navigating parking lots while trying to avoid insane drivers and even crazier shoppers.  Ahh, you gotta love the holiday season!  Another improvement in the 2001 I30 is bigger brakes which proved worthy under all conditions, hard braking, stoplights, etc.  The decrease in speed is even and smooth.  Overall, the I30 handles like the luxury sedan it is: responsive and precise.  The braking is as smooth as silk as well as the riding experience.

<b>What a great car!</b>
In conclusion, the I30 is a great car at a impressive price, starting
 around $30,000.  The newly-redesigned model for 2001 meets and even exceeds Infiniti's legendary prestige and power.  So if you're on the market for a reliable car that can compete for years to come, consider the 2001 Infiniti I30.<br><br>
