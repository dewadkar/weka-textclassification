            After much research on the myriad of digital cameras, I finally decided on the Fuji finepix 2400.  I  purchased mine locally at a Ritz Camera store.  I had seen the camera advertised at Ritz's online store for $374.99, which I thought was a fair price from a reputable dealer.  I saw cheaper prices at other websites, but I do not believe a digital camera is something you want to buy from some fly-by-night store.  Just imagine the nightmare of having to return a defective unit from some store in New Jersey.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the local Ritz store had the camera for the same online price.  I bought it and I could not be happier.  

The camera has many nice features.  It has a good zoom as well as four different flash modes:  Red Eye, Standard, Suppressed with slow shutter speed (for night), and no flash.  Of course, you can also choose automatic flash and the camera will decide the flash for you.  The setup of the camera is fairly straightforward, but you will need to follow the manual.  Once you get it set up, it is truly a breeze to use.  I've been taking pictures of everything from my dog to my girlfriend's garden.  All the pictures turn out great.  

The camera uses a USB connection, so make sure your computer has a universal serial bus connection.  The included software is a snap to install and transferring images from the camera to your computer is as simple as plugging in the USB cable and dragging & dropping.  

The included software doesn't have many features, but it does allow you to shrink the images, or rotate them if you wish.  You will need to shrink the images to e-mail them, otherwise your recipient will receive a massive sized picture.

The only negative about this camera might be the quickness in which it uses up batteries.  The camera came with 4 new batteries, which were promptly used up.  I solved the problem by buying rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter.  I believe the rechargeable batteries and AC adapter are must haves.  Plan on spending about $20 for the rechargeable batteries and recharger and $30 for an AC adapter from Ritz. 

Other than the battery issue, I am completely happy with my camera.  I highly recommend it!
