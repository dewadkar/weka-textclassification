            I am 64 years old and folding myself into and out of so called compacts in not an option.  Recommended this vehicle to friends who had exactly that problem. They purchased a new four door and they love it - in fact they just rave about it.  There is room in the cargo space (with the seats folded) for my 2 big dogs.  My son and grandson I and took a road trip of 400 miles and were completely comfortable. It's easy to find a parking place for and it is very reliable and economical to drive.<br><br>
