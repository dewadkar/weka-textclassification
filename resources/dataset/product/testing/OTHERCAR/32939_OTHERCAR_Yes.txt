            UPDATED 12/14/03 - It's 3 years old now. Do we still love it? Yes. No major problems. We have about 27,000 miles. We don't drive long distance often. This van does most of its work within a few miles of home. Tons of stop and go. School is only a mile away. This van doesn't get a chance to warm up. Even so, the engine runs great with this hard duty. We do take long trips a few times a year. It does great at that. Our best mileage has been 23.6 MPG. The stereo volume control started to crackle a few months ago. It was replaced under warranty. The brakes are squeeking now. I think the stop and go has shortened their life. Good van. I'll buy another one if I had to choose today.

UPDATED 6/12/02 - We are 18 months and 15,000 miles into owning our 2001 Gr. Caravan ES and we still love it. The rattle I complained about earlier is now gone. We had service a few months ago on the front sway bar bushings that got a little noisy. (Our 97 had the same thing happen to it.) Not a big deal, they were fixed for free and they threw in an oil change. Service has improved. 

Engine broke in a little more and MPG improved. Service tech said this was normal and the new engines have significantly harder rings and sleeves for improved durability but take several thousands of miles to break in.. We averaged 23 MPG Highway on our last long trip. City only driving we see about 15-16 MPG. We still go a couple of weeks between fillups when we're just doing school runs and shopping. Engine has a little more pep after 15,000. It doesn't burn oil between changes. Transmission perfect, they quieted the classic Chrysler 'ticking' sound they make as they downshift during a stop. 

The power doors. Don't buy one without all three. They are all so useful, especially with young children. They have worked perfectly. With a kid in one arm and a stroller in the other, it's nice to only have to push a button to close up the car. Also, on a hot summer day, I pop all 3 doors open to vent the heat before we get in. 

I know I wished for a Honda like folding 3 row seat, but we have had occasion to out one of the 2 split folding seats for increased luggage space while still having a seat in the third row. We have the integrated child seat and that's been great. You can recline the seat with the kid strapped in and asleep. A must have feature for young families.

As for the rest... Auto Climate control - excellent, powerful. Ride - very controlled, quiet and comfortable, quick handling. Interior - Seat fabric holding up well, no stains tho we've tried. Console buttons and switches all good.

We still really like this car. Email me if you have questions. Addr. at the bottom. - END UPDATE 

This is our second Grand Caravan. We lease a 97 Sport and really enjoyed it. It was our practice minivan, not having owned one. Well, we hated the bench seats in it. Just killed our backs when we sat with our daughter and her baby seat. It was our practice minivan. So in the 2001 Grand Caravan ES we ordered we opted for the built-in child seat and captains chairs. 

Our sales guy tried to sway us away from the built-in child seat option. It's only $125. The price of a good kids seat.  We couldn't understand why. He said it wasn't as comfortable as a regular seat. When the seat belts are stowed properly, it's plenty comfortable. And the convenience of this seat is great. We have a 4 year old. We take long trips to our folks. It reclines, she sleeps long and hard. We drive happily. This seat is very comfortable for her. It has a Velcro attached liner that can be washed. Brilliant. If you have kids, you MUST order this seat. The sales guy doesn't have kids.

We ordered the 3.3 engine. It's slightly better on gas than the 3.8. We find the 3.3 to be very adequate. It's no land rocket, but it cruises on the highway at 75 MPH without a struggle. It downshifts smoothly to pass. It has noticeably more power than the previous 3.3. Up about 30 hp. On a trip we see about 22 MPG. I expect to see about 24 MPG within a year. Our old one just got better and better. Oh, and don't be scared by terrible fuel economy in the first 3,000 to 4,000 miles. We were getting 15 MPG. It scared me to death. These engine have harder materials in them and take longer to break in. Hopefully they will prove more durable. 

Interior on the ES is excellent. The console is a great feature. Being able to power the cell phone from the jack in the console keeps the wires to a minimum. Our 97 Caravan had tremendous heating and cooling capacity. Tons of cold and warm quickly. Only problem was we were continuously messing with the temperature slider. Never could keep the temp where we wanted it. The tri-zone auto-climate control fixes all of this beautiful. The Honda doesn't have tri-zone. It holds the temp very well. When we're parked in the garage you can hear the blend doors purr into position. It's really neat. The system makes tiny adjustments all the time. It's a complex system and Chrysler has done a good job of making the control understandable. The best part about this system is that you just touch 'auto' set the temp and forget about it. You can always route the air as you wish.

Seats are nice and firm, like in our Honda Accord. The power drivers seat is a good option for distance drivers. Nice to have variety.

The power doors, all three are fantastic. The power tailgate is so useful for groceries. We always seemed to go shopping when it's raining. Now we can grab the last bunch of bags and run in the house without getting wet or dirty messing with the tailgate door. 

There had to be some bad, and there is. Our dealer. We have had a rattle in the dash since we got it. It isn't terribly loud, but it is annoying. We will be going back for a 6th time to get it repaired. It's not that it broke 5 times, it's that they never fixed it in the 5 times we've been there. 

Trouble aside, we like it. It's the best riding van we tried. We were leaning toward the Odyssey and then just liked the Dodge better. I wish we had the 3rd row hiding seat of the Odyssey. That would be excellent. But the split bench is easy to get in and out. It just takes up space in our garage.

Honda builds cars well, but we have friends who had trouble with the sliding doors in the Honda and dealer troubles too. Our Accord just took about $2000 in repairs in the last year. There are no guarantees, but so far, Caravans have served us very well.
