            The 2000 Chevy S-10 eXtreme is one of those cars that come packaged like a low rider car.If you've ever seen the S-10 eXtreme you know what I'm talking about.

The lift on the truck is meer inches making is look incrediably appealing to teenagers looking to go cruisin' and pick up chicks.

The S-10 is also very custombizable; Flareside or flatside? Short or long bed? Four or six cylinders? Two-wheel or four-wheel-drive? Regular or extended cab? 

If you look in truck magazines there are many many more things you can get for your S-10 truck to customize it.I got a big white cut out chevy sticker for the back.I've seen people who put superchargers and turbos in their S-10's and might I say they haul butt big time (but they guzzle gas too...)

That's something else you must focus on while deciding on getting this truck.The truck guzzles mad gas.On average you'll get about 20 miles to the gallon with the eXtreme version of the S-10, so expect to make many pit stops for gas (gas may be coming down this summer to 1.30 but trust me it will be a lot higher next year).

The trucks stability without a load in the back makes it a bit wobbily in rough conditions.But if your just cruisin the freeway or down some street you won't have many problems.Another thing, don't race this truck.Sixty percent of it's weight is concentrated in the back so expect to lose big time to any car.

The S-10 eXtreme I purchased was only a V4 but they still will knock your socks off.The truck is a manual (what truck isn't?) which makes me mad because I had to learn how to use a manual.

The trucks comfortable in it's compactable space.It seats only two comfortably though, three if you want someone in the middle (but you'll have the problem of that person in the middle being in the way of the driver attempting to shift).If you get an extended cab it'll cost more but I would recommend it.Something my friend did for his eXtreme was put really nice seats in the back facing the opposite way which make the truck extremely cool to cruise in.

Overall, this truck was made for cruisin, not for families or for construction sites.
