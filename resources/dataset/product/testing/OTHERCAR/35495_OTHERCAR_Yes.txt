            We did lots of research before ordering this vehicle. Our only complaint was the amount of time waiting for delivery (about 7 months ago) when they were in short supply. We've found it to be all we anticipated and lives up to our expectations. We went on an extended trip with the minivan and were delighted with the handling and performance. As there was only two of us we kept the rear seat folded down and were amazed at the vast amount of storage available. We ended up hauling some items back to Florida for our friends from Missouri as they had a Chrysler minivan with limited storage. Our experience with the service department of our dealership has been satisfactory.<br><br>
