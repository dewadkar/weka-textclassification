            I was nervous about buying my second digital cameral, worried that i would miss many of the cool featured i enjoyed on my Olympus. But one by one, as i unpacked my Toshiba PDR-M4, i found everything i enjoyed on my Olympus, plus some! Some examples of the bells and whistles:
 1. Camera can be plugged directly into television for immediate viewing of photos.
 2. Camera comes with rechargeable internal battery. No more buying endless packs of expensive batteries.
 3. On-screen menu is extremely easy to navigate. I was constantly referring to the manual on my old Olympus.
 4. Toggles between color and black and white mode with one button.
 5. USB port downloads 24 pictures in about 20 seconds. The Olympus used a serial port that took about 15 minutes.
 6. More flexibility with flash and close-up shots. 
 7. Customer support is top-notch. 
 8. Software is very smooth and comprehensive. Much easier to manage files and resize/recrop images. Includes drag and drop feature to insert images into documents and web pages.
   And on, and on, and on....All this and 2.1 megapixel resolution. I was very impressed by the entire package. The gang at Toshiba really thought this one through. If you're nervous about making your first digital camera purchase, this camera will put your fears to rest.
