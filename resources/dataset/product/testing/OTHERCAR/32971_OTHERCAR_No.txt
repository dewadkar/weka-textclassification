            I am looking at automotive reviews on this web site, and thinking people are only saying good things. How about a review from someone who is very disappointed with their purchase?
I traded my beautiful 1994 Nissan Pathfinder for a leased brand new 1997 Toyota Camry LE. I wanted something better on gas, and with a warranty. I was very impressed with the smooth ride, and the fact the special lease price actually made it cheaper than the Civic I was looking at. 
I would be easier to list the problems I've had with this car in point form:
-The headliner rattled almost from day one. It took the dealer 4 trys to fix.
-I remained happy for about a month until I heard a noise from the front suspension. I found out from other 4 cylinder Camry owners that this was a common problem! The dealer fixed on the second try.
-Front passenger door window had a small chip in the upper back corner, the dealer told me it probably came from a pebble being stuck in the window groove! I have had many power windowed vehicles, and had never heard of this before. They would not replace the window, but would grind the chip smooth. I agreed. The didn't take the window out to do this and ended up scratching the paint on the door and had to repaint it!
-Approximately a month later the same chip appeared on the drivers side, they finally offered to replace both front door windows.
-The passenger side front seat belt stopped retracting and had to be replaced.
-The trunk lock didn't work very good from the beginning, the key always kind of stuck in it. It was replaced, they cracked the taillight in the process and it took about 2 months to get a replacement. This is when I found out this particular car was actually made in Japan, the taillight is different on the American made one? My thought at the time was so much for Japanese quality!
-The in dash CD changer/player locked up and had to be replaced.
-The steering wheel squeaked for a while, it couldn't be replicated at the dealer, it has gone away on it's own now.
-The latest problem is with the front brakes. They were pulsating, it turned out a pebble (where are all these pebbles coming from??!!) stuck in between the rotor and the brake pad. Both are scored badly. I have never heard of this before, except on my brother-in-law's Civic. Of course none of this is covered under warranty. Even though I consider it a design flaw.
There are more, but I can't think of them all right now.
I like the large trunk, the quiet interior.
I don't like the fact that the arm rest on the door and on the console are both not covered in fabric (the plastic sticks to your elbow), and the trunk hinges squish stuff.<br><br>
