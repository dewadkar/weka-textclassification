            Original review: 07/01 I have had 2 Maximas - a 1991 and more recently a 1996. I cannot say enough good things about these cars. They are very reliable. My 91 is still in great shape, have about 155000 miles on it and it is going strong. No major repairs at all. It does go through brakes quickly and for some reason cant hold a front wheel alignment very long. But thats it as far as chronic problems. Recently (the car is 10 years old) small cosmetic type things have been breaking. But this car has been great. The 96 we sold because we didnt need 2 of them, and my favorite was the 91 SE. It is a fun car to drive, has plenty of power, and is very comfortable, even on long drives. I hesitate to get a new car because this one has served me so well. I dont like the design of the new Maximas, but I am sure they are wonderful, too. It is funny, I get notes on my car all the time from people who want to buy it. One guy offered me $7500 for it, probably a good deal for me, but then I would have to turn around and buy something else. So I declined. If you are looking for a reliable, comfortable, fun to drive car - the older Nissan Maximas are a great choice.

Update 12/03: We still have the 91 Maxima SE. It is no longer my daily driver as we have just purchased an 04 Honda Odyssey. The Maxima is still going strong. It has just over 210,000 miles. The car's cosmetics are in need of some TLC but mechanically the car is perfect. It runs strong, plenty of pep left. The transmission still shifts smoothly. Brakes are good, but dont seem to last too long. FINALLY figured out why the car cant hold an alignment - after several years of trying different tire shops/dealers. There was a loose someting under the CV boot. Last alignment is still holding - and its been almost a year! The car is still a good solid car. Even the sunroof/moonroof still works. We have had to replace all the power window motors, but I think for the age of the car that isn't too bad. It is still a nice quiet ride, no rattles, no wind noise. The car is safe, reliable and we plan on keeping it. Our daughter will use it when she starts driving. Its cheap to keep and thats what we plan on doing.
