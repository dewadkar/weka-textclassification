            &quot;THE STORY!&quot;

&quot;Honey! Pack your bags! where movin' to Chicago!!!&quot;  Those where the exact words that my husband said when he walked in the door after work one day.

Chicago?!?  &quot;The Windy City!&quot;  Where winters are a not only cold and windy but SNOW, and lots of it!  In all of the excitement I had forgotten about the fact that my Fiat X-19 was not practical for Chicago's winters. Within two weeks we were packed and ready to go.  A few days before the move it had dawned on me that I needed to have another car.  Something that was practical, easy for me to handle and of course, a GOOD &quot;winter car.&quot;  The search was on!  What kind of car was the best choice for me?  I was looking for a new vehicle with an affordable price.  I came across a Jeep dealer who had just received new year stock and there she was.....a beautiful, gun metal grey brand new Jeep Cherokee Sport in all of her glory!!!  She was breathtaking!!! (Now don't ask me why since I have always been partial to little sports cars, but this, I had to have!!!)

Well, I'm sure you know the rest of the story so I won't go on. 

&quot;THE FACTS!&quot;

I got a great lease deal, only $242.00 a month!  Fully loaded!  I guess that's standard.  Power everything, automatic, 4WD and they even threw in a 10 cd changer with a remote!  What can I say?  If you know how to talk you can get almost anything!  

I've driven many cars in my lifetime (32 years - 16 driving) and I can say that the Jeep Cherokee IS the most exciting vehicle in my time!  She handles extremely well in all weather conditions, (especially snow and ice in 4WD) her ride is surprisingly smooth for a &quot;SUV&quot;, and she has been the most reliable friend that I have ever known!!!

Well, I'm not one of those people who can tell you all about the dynamics or specifications or whatever the mechanical details would be called, but I can tell you that the Jeep Cherokee Sport is a GREAT SUV!  I have found a new love in my life (2nd to my husband of course) that I wouldn't trade for the world!  I'm sure that when my lease expires, that I will be right back at that lot looking for a new 3 year love affair!

I would recommend the Jeep Cherokee Sport to anyone who is looking for great reliability, a good looking vehicle and a great value for a great price!
