            I just got my first Golf, a 2002 GLS, automatic. (Canada)
It was 8 months old.  This probably applies to 2003 as well since they are exactly the same in Canada.

I have had it for almost 2 weeks and here are my initial observations.

A really nice ride:
I found the suspension much nicer than most small econo cars.  Very firm on corners, yet soft enough over rough road.

Luxurious interior:
Velour seats, quality of materials, and lighting is excellent.

Drivetrain:
Peppy for a 4 cylinder, almost feels like a 6 cylinder.  Nice easy shifting with the AT.  Easily drive 4 adults around.

Downsides:
Blindspots: Hard to see sometimes over left shoulder.  Have to remove middle rear headrest to get a good view out the back window. Rear view window seems oddly small, but acceptable.

Fuel economy:  It has only been a short while, but i found I went through gas much quicker than with my previous car, a Mazda Protege.  My driving habits haven't changed at all.

Cup holder:  Yes, it tucks away nice, but can be a pain sometimes.  I will be buying the accessory cupholder which latches on to the armrest.
