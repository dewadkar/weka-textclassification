            I purchased my Accent just a few months ago, in September of 1999. I like it because it has a great warranty and it's low price, and such an effective engine. It has a 10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain warranty. On top of that it's cheap, and you can get 37 miles to the gallon!!! WOW!!! Some negatives do come in though. You sacrifice the trunk when you buy this car. Another thing is it only has 3 valves per cylinder in it's in-line four cylinder engine. With that you don't get great pick up, but the car will go. If you're single or don't have any kids this would be a great car. Like myself, I just usually haul around my girlfriend or some other friends, so i highly rate this car, it's a real steal in car market today.<br><br>
