            I bought my 95 Chevy Tracker in October of 1994 and it's still going strong with 86,000 miles on it.  The reason I bought the Tracker was because I wanted a four wheel drive vehicle that got great gas mileage and was also in my budget.  I am a customer support representative and use my tracker for business driving and also recreational driving.  Whether driving around the Pittsburgh area or driving to Columbus or Cleveland, Ohio, I never have to worry about any problems with my car.  <br><br>
