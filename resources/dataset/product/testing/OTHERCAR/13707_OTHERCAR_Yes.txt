            I have fallen in love with my 626 ES-v6. I highly recommend upgrading to leather seats as well as the 6 cyl. automatic. It makes a big difference. I have driven this car on many trips and it has been very comfortable, for long rides as well as short. I've found the extra power of the V6 to be beneficial in the mountains. Gas mileage is average. Leather seats are a must...the stock fabric ones looked very cheap. This car has much more inside room than its competitors and almost more than the next step up, Millenia, plus its simply better designed. Much more attractive to the eye.<br><br>
