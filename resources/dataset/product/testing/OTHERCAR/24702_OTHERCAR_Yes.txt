            I purchased this SUV a little over a year ago for the simple fact that we needed more room for things such as the huge stroller I purchased for my son and also all the other things I transport when I travel with him.  So far, despite some minor problems, this had been a pretty good vehicle.  So far I've put over 22,000 miles on so it it well broken in.

Before deciding on this particular SUV, I looked at both the Ford Explorer and Chevy Blazer and decided that this was going to be the best value.  Even though I have the family discounts available for both Ford and GM through my stepfather (thanks John!), it was still going to be out of my price range to purchase the other.  I also went on the reputation of Cherokee and since they have been around for many years and you still see many older ones still one the road.  I was also fortunate to find a 2W to save me a little money.  I live in Indiana so hills in the winter are not really a concern so does pretty good in the winter.

I honestly was a little hesitant to drive such a big vehicle because I've always owned smaller cars and I find them quite easy to maneuver.  Well it only took me about a month before I forgot that I was driving a truck.  Now when I drive my husband's Monte Carlo, I feel as though I am sitting on the ground!

I have had some minor problems since I purchased this.  The first one occurred last fall and it started running really rough.  I took it into the dealership and they replaced some sort of tube, then two days later it did it again.  Finally on the third trip in, they found that there was fluid leaking on one of the components and once they fixed it, the problem was gone.  The next problems I had was the windshield wiper arms snapped in the middle of washing my windows while driving.  The metal actually cracked in half and had to be replace.  Currently, we need to take it in because the washer fluid reservoir in the rear is only squirting the washer fluid about half the time.

It is comfortable to drive in as long as your in the front seat.  When we traveled from Indiana to Michigan when my son was four-months-old, I opted to sit in back with him to keep in entertained.  It was not long into the trip when my legs felt cramped and my back got quite uncomfortable.  It is also a rather bumpy ride back there.  I know the front seat are comfortable for sleeping because I often take a lunchtime nap in there!

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I would probably buy another one, but next time I want a four-wheel drive!<br><br>
