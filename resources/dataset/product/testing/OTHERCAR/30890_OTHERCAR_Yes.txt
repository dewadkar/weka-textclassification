            I only buy a new car once a decade, when the last one is on its last legs, and when I do, I do it very empirically. I want (1) reliability (2) room to haul sporting and musical equipment (3) safety and (4) value. I usually end up have two vehicles- a small car for commuting, and a minivan for shopping and camping. This time out both my commuter and my minivan were on their last legs, so I thought I'd get a single car that could serve both purposes.

After sorting through the market, two cars seemed to fit the bill: A 4-cylinder Saturn VUE, and the new Honda Element. I liked both makes; my last car was a Saturn station wagon, and before that, a Honda 4WD wagon, and I put over 120,000 miles on each. But totaling up repair and maintenance costs, the Honda was much cheaper in the long run even though it cost more (in inflation adjusted dollars) to buy. It also test drove better, and seemed a better use of the available space.  And it was cheaper. You can get into an Element for $16,000, though most of the ones I've seen on the road have been the loaded 4WD models that go for around $20,000. 

I've had the car for nearly a year now, and taken two major trips in it as well as numerous weekend trips hauling kayaks to the lake. I've also been using it as a daily commuter since the snow began falling. I'm still pleased with my purchase, with some caveats.

One: It's not the best city vehicle. Sure, it's short and parks easy, but city visibility is poor. A small car can almost disappear from view if it gets to close behind you, and I am forever worried about backing into a child or short adult coming out of a driveway or parking spot. (I'm thinking about installing a TV camera to rectify this).

Two: Mileage is awful. Not if you're used to a full-sized pickup or van, but 20/26 is pretty low for a small vehicle. Some of this is due to the weight- the Element outweighs the more expensive CRV- and some is due to aerodynamics, the Element being about as streamlined as a brick. This could have been helped by adding another gear to the transmission, or (and maybe Honda will do this soon) using a hybrid power plant. 

And there's the matter of looks. You either love or hate the Element; no one seems to be neutral about it. A woman I met on the sidewalk in front of my Element made a point of telling me it was the ugliest thing she'd ever seen- twice. I think it's kind of cute, myself. 

Would I buy it again? Probably, although I rather liked my previous combination of the Saturn wagon and Chrysler minivan. The Element isn't as pleasant to drive long distances as either, really, and it doesn't have the cargo capacity of the minivan with seats removed. It's not long enough inside to sleep in, like the minivan. But it's more versatile that either, and you don't have to remove the seats to open up the cargo space. And it's much easier to work on than either. 

Interestingly, I have yet to see one driven by a 20-something, Honda's target market; owners all seem to be middle aged like myself.
