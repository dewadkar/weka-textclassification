            I have been driving my Honda Civic for several years and it has treated me well.  I went for the EX Coupe because of the added horsepower, and from the test drives I did, the additional engine power did make a big difference over the DX model. 

Some of the features I like include the 60/40 trunk which I have used often to move stuff around, go skiing, etc.  The EX comes standard with keyless entry, sunroof, and power windows and locks which makes this affordable small car much more luxurious.  

The older EX Models (before 1999) only come with a radio (no tape or CD).  Starting in 1999, Honda has added a CD player on the EX which is a definite great bonus.  It has also added map lights in 1999.

On the negative side, the back seat is a little small and is a tough squeeze to get 3 people in the back.  If there's only 4 people, it's a comfortable ride.

Finally, I think the Civic handles very well on the road (I drive the manual) and gives me plenty of horsepower.  Most important - it is the most fuel efficient car I have had.  The tank is about 11 gallons or so but I probably get 35 MPG on the highway.  The EX also comes with cruise control which is a nice bonus. 

This car is great value for the money.  I looked at a bunch of cars in a similar price range and none could stand up to the Civic.  My lease is coming due, and I will likely buy another Honda<br>
