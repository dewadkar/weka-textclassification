            We bought our 1991 Grand Voyager in 1994, just before our 3rd child was born.  We needed a bigger car and had heard good things about the Chrysler mini vans.  The van was comfortable, and loaded with options. We liked its smooth ride and convenience features.

Before purchase, we had our mechanic check it out and, as a result, had the dealer replace the ABS computer control module.  Within 2 years, we had to have the transmission rebuilt.  Our apparent mistake was in having the Chrysler dealer do it, because we need another one 4 years later.  We have had the fuel pump replaced, the A/C system repaired ($1700), and the heater core in the rear replaced.  

Minor problems include having the A/C controls jam and having both of the wiper assemblies fall off in the middle of  rain storms (not at the same time).  The storage drawer under the front passenger seat has broken twice, and the upper rear brake light cover broke. This is apparently not replaceable.  Many parts, such as interior bolts and A/C vent covers have fallen off.  We have the fake wood side panel trim on this van and it is peeling off.   We have had about 8 recalls performed during this period also. 

I realize that the van is nearly 10 years old, but most of these problems occurred within 5 years, a period of time which I think is far too short for most of these problems to have arisen.    <br><br>
