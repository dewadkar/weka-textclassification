            The AGFA ePhoto 780c is an &quot;InstaMatic-style, point and shoot&quot; camera with lots of &quot;bang for the buck.&quot;  I purchased this camera through BizRate.com which directed my search to Mercata.com.  After all the &quot;new user rebates and credits,&quot; the AGFA ePhoto 780c wound up costing me under $100, so the reason I originally bought this camera was PRICE, PRICE, PRICE!  I have always favored AGFA conventional print film, so I thought the AGFA brand would be a satisfactory brand choice as an entry-level digital camera.

After expecting a piece of junk for low-dollar cost, WOW--was I surprised and pleasantly amazed!  AGFA pulled out all the stops on this one!  It is a rich-featured camera with lots of great technology built-in.

The camera works extremely well for everyday photos, including those that you might typically upload to your own business or family web site(s).  It has four resolutions: CGA, VGA (640 X 480), SVGA, and XGA.  For most eMailing and Web Site use, the VGA (640 X 480) is the resolution of choice; otherwise, dial-up users will have a long &quot;World Wide Wait&quot; for the web site to load and display or for the eMail picture attachment(s) to upload or download.

The best thing about the camera is the wonderful, well-authored, high-quality, easy-to-learn, easy-to-use PhotoGenie software that comes FREE with the camera.  By attaching your AGFA ePhoto 780c to your computer via its included cable that attaches to your RS232 serial port, the photographs stored on the camera's SmartMedia microdisk are quickly uploaded from the camera to your computer.  You can view a thumbnail sketch of all photos that were in the camera.  The photos can be professionally re-touched and &quot;fixed&quot; by YOU using the QuickFix function (or you can do your own manual re-touching).  The AGFA PhotoGenie software also allows you to create an instant on-screen slide show of all your selected *.jpg (JPEG) photos taken with your camera (or from other *.jpg sources).

Those thinking that they must spend $700 and up for buying an overpriced, megapixel camera thinking that this is &quot;the only answer&quot; are mistaken.  Only those who wish to make super-high-resolution PRINTS need a megapixel camera with a telephoto lens.  For the rest of us, the AGFA ePhoto 780c is &quot;good enough,&quot; because all of my pictures are either posted to my web sites, viewed on-screen from a notebook computer, or eMailed to clients, business associates, friends, or family.  You can make great &quot;wallpaper&quot; scenery for your Windows Desktop--use the higher resolution modes (SVGA or XGA--1024 X 768--Four Stars &quot;****&quot;) for a larger picture.

Those who really only want a quick and easy way to take digital pictures that they could eMail or post to their family or business web sites will just LOVE this camera!  The VGA (640 X 480) resolution mode (Two Stars, or &quot;**&quot;) is the most versatile for most uses.  Why?  Because it DOES NOT take up gobs and gobs of disk space, yet it yields picture quality that is quite satisfactory for all on-screen (non-print) applications and web sites--these pictures load quickly and are easily eMailed to friends, business associates, and family.  The camera has a great VIEWing screen on the back that is bright and easy-to-see--your portrait subjects can pick out which picture(s) are &quot;keepers.&quot;  You can instantly choose to delete or keep the digital photo(s) you just took.  

The camera takes extremely good portraits indoors with flash and the red-eye reduction feature enabled.

For the money, it's one fantastic camera for anyone--from novice users to professionals--who may find it to be an inexpensive, very handy backup or main camera to carry in their camera bag.  I would, however, suggest buying an additional, larger-capacity, SmartMedia microdisk (removable &quot;flash memory&quot;) and extra &quot;AA&quot; batteries if you are planning to take the camera on a long vacation or business trip.

The only drawback is battery life (it uses 4 &quot;AA&quot; batteries).  I've found that you need to close the door on the front of the camera frequently to conserve battery life (this &quot;door&quot; is the &quot;on/off&quot; switch).  Once I figured out that keeping the front door closed is the secret to long battery life, I no longer believe that is really a problem.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a SIMPLE, &quot;idiot-proof,&quot; camera with terrific software that takes great pictures at very low cost.  The software alone is worth the price of the camera!

Those who think that having a 3.5-inch disk drive in the camera (such as in the SONY Mavica) are buying lots of extra bulk and extra expense.  There are adapters available to convert the included SmartMedia to a 3.5-inch diskette, but connecting the included RS232 Serial Cable to the computer and camera is quick and easy.  Make sure you CLOSE the front door (&quot;on/off&quot; switch) when uploading pictures from your camera to your computer (your computer with the PhotoGenie software installed) will be able to read the SmartMedia WITHOUT having the camera's power &quot;turned on.&quot;<br><br>
