            Presently I am taking a Basic Digital Photography course at the local Community College as a requirement for my Graphic Design Certificate.  This is the camera we are using and I personally have found that it makes great pictures and it's very easy to use.  Before beginning the class, I was going to buy my own digital camera to use but decided to wait until I had completed the course.  Boy am I glad because I would have settled for something that was yes, cheaper, but nowhere near the quality.  For some reason I had steered away from Kodak, perhaps flashbacks to my old Instamatic?  (Wish I would have had this when I went to Paris, I would have known at once that I cut off the top of the Eiffel Tower!) Once I finish the course in December, this is the camera that I probably will buy.  I'm hoping that with Christmas approaching, the price will also drop a little.<br><br>
