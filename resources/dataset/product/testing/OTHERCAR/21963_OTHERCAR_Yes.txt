            Hi,

I've had my X5 3.0 for about 5 mo. now and can honestly
say I love it. I'm not an SUV lover by any means. I get
my kicks from my Z3. If you need the space, 5 seats and
like the high ride it is the best I've driven. I test drove 
the MDX, Mercedes and Navigator, and owned a Blazer for
many years prior to the X5 and still feel it wins out.

Things I would change:

�The GPS menuing could be simplified. Too many
 button presses for location entry etc.

�Power steering variable assist really could be much
 more helpful at slow speeds. Very heavy feel to park etc.

2 cents dept.
I get really tired of reading reviews comparing cars and SUVs, especially the X5 which at times seems to be under
attack for making an SUV that in most performance tests
can be compared to better cars. It doesn't take a physicist
to understand that any vehicle with a high center of gravity
has a huge disadvantage over one with a low one in handling.
BMW has done extremely well with the X5 to keep it in control
and still maintain a smooth ride and good road feel.
