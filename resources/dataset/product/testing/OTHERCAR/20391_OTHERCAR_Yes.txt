            My 2001 Golf GL was my first new car.  I bought it in March of my senior year of college, and 5 months later I love it more than I thought I would.  I was going to buy a used Golf, but discovered  VW's hold their value so well I might as well buy a new one!

I considered buying a Honda Civic, but they seemed much larger than anything I wanted to drive and they're hard to find with a manual transmission, which I demand.  I told myself I should consider a Ford Focus, but my heart was always set on the Golf.

--Pros--

I bought the basic, no-frills model - 2 doors, no special features at all.  I love the fact that even on the basic model, I got air conditioning, power trunk and gas door, stereo/tape deck, and lots of other little "extras" (like a 12-V outlet in the trunk) that make life easier.  

The interior is roomy and looks great - all my friends go OOH! the first time they see the blue VW dashboard lights.  I got the black interior which shows dirt more than I'd like, but I'm just a messy person that way.  The front seats fold WAY forward so slipping into the back is easy, and the back seats are split for extra fold-down flexibility.  I took 2 friends to IKEA, and we managed to get all of our purchases into the back and still have a seat left for everyone to sit in!

The highway gas mileage on this car is incredible.  I've driven from Richmond to Washington (100 miles) on a couple of gallons of gas, no joke!  The city mileage is average to good, depending on how many stop lights you hit.  Pick-up in the manual transmission is great, and the transmission is very responsive to down-shifting for extra torque.  The brakes are extra-responsive, and I absolutely love the "springy" clutch.  The car handles well, and I take turns with confidence, even in bad weather.

The safety features on this car are second to none in its class.  Front and side air bags, plus air curtains to protect you from shattered glass.  The car also comes with a full 2 year warranty, plus a 10-year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty (engine, transmission, drive train, etc).  I get oil, lube and filter changes (plus full diagnostics) at 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 miles for free at my dealer.  I plan to keep this car for a long time, so these were a big draw for me.

The construction of this car just feels like quality.  I did have my back bumper scratched (I live in the city and my car is always parallel parked), but when someone hit my passenger-side mirror last week, it popped back into place, no damage done.  The Golf feels solid, not wimpy and plastic like a lot of compacts.

--Cons--

On the 2-door model, the seat belt is sort of far back and hard to reach, since I'm shorter and pulled up closer to the wheel.  I wanted a sunroof, but that option isn't available on the GL, only the more expensive 4-door GLS.  And $400 is a bit steep for a single CD player when I could put a whole new faceplate + CD in for $250 at an audio shop.  But really, no complaints.
