            Well, I must admit that used this site quite extensively when my wife and I started searching for our new car and I found it to be an invaluable source of information.   Thus, I decided to try and do my part to help someone else with their next purchase.

We started "Car Quest 2002" (as we called it) in July of this year as our faithful '90 Excel started to make some very unnatural noises.  We did a LOT of research and comparison between the CR-V, Ford Escape, Jeep Liberty and Saturn VUE.  Ultimately it came down to VUE vs. CR-V.

Pro's for the VUE: More appealing exterior styling, V6 Power, Price (We have $3000 GM Dollars that we could put towards the purchase).

Cons for the VUE: Interior finish quality, noise

Pro's for the CR-V ?  Well, I'll get to that in a bit.

I'll give a bit of history on the dealer experience as I have seen a number of reviews and postings about the high demand for the CR-V and the dealers position when negotiating price.

First off, I live in Toronto Canada, so all prices mentioned here are in CDN funds.

We had some preliminary discussions with a few local dealers and they all confirmed what I was hearing about the CR-V market.  That is, "If you don't want to pay full list price, there is someone right behind you who will."  
My recommendation when hearing this...Don't believe the hype.

I decided to switch gears a little bit and take the advice of my brother-in-law.  He suggested using a car broker as he had when he purchased his last car.  Although sceptical at first, I can confidently tell you that it is worth persuing.  This broker gave me a price over the phone (just one price...no negotiating), ordered the car from a local dealer, and delivered it to my home.  My service is done by the dealer just as if I walked in and bought it from them directly.

Dealer list on a 2003 CRV-EXL (Leather), $32,400 CDN.

What I paid: $29,100 CDN. 

All of the information I gathered is that the dealer invoice cost on the CR-V is $28,700.  
I'm not saying that I got the best price, but I do believe that I got a good deal.  Overall, know this... there is definately some wiggle room.

We ordered the car in August and delivery was delayed for a few reasons.
1) We had to wait for production of the 2003's to begin.
2) Black is one of the less popular colors (and therefore at the end of the production runs)
3) Leather interior.  Leather is apparently not an option in the US, and again...demand dictates the production run.

Now that the car has been delivered (after an agonizing 3 month wait) what can I tell you about it ?

This is a superbly built car...period.  Quality of construction, fit & finish are excellent.  In other words, typical Honda.  This was my first..but rest assured, there are loyal buyers of Honda products for a reason.

Power is adequate.  Not jaw dropping, but it is more than sufficient for the size of vehicle.
What is extraordinary is how smooth and quiet the engine is.
If you are not careful, it's hard to tell that it is running at idle.

Instruments are well laid out and easy to read/reach.  The automatic transmission jutting from the dash takes some getting used to, but I don't forsee it as a problem for most.  One minor annoyance is that while in Drive, depending on your body size, it blocks the volume knob on the radio.

Lots of storage in front (and back for that matter).  An abundance of cubby holes, cup holders and storage bins will make sure the nice interior does not get cluttered.

I'll stop right here and say this... For us, the dealbreaker between the CR-V and the Saturn VUE was the interior.  Remember, we basically gave up $3000 in free money (GM points) to instead go with the CR-V, so you have to believe that it was worth it.

As mentioned, we opted for the EXL trim package.  In Canada, that equates to the top trim level   Leather interior.  Therefore, we got some additional bonuses, like seat warmers (driver & passenger), side mirror heaters and sunroof.  My wife LOVES the seat warmers !

My only other complaint about the interior is the placement of the pedals.  I find that they are a little too close together for my feet (size 11).  I find the edge of my shoe continually grazing the sides of the brake when I hit the gas.  Again, I am pretty sure I will get used to this, but it's odd..considering there is lots of room for wider placement.

There is a LOT of storage space in the back.  According to the specs, the CR-V has more interior room than any other model in its class, and I'd believe it.
The ability of the back seats to tumble forward (with the headrests still attached) is a great feature and easy to operate.  (One note - you can't tumble them forward if the front seats are slid as far back as they will go.  You need to move them about an inch forward.  They can be slid back again once the "tumbling" is complete).

Back seat passengers will be very comfortable.  The seats are slighly elevated (I believe they call it Stadium seating), allowing for a great view over the heads of the front seat occupants.  A convenient arm rest folds down in the center, complete with drink holders.

Cargo area is pretty standard in appearance, but of course there is that cool picnic table.  Now I must confess...my wife and I think that this is the neatest thing ever, but we're not sure when we will use it.  Now only if they figured out a way to pack some chairs in there too  :)
Tie downs in the floor and bag hooks on the sides provide lots of ways to secure cargo.

Another oddity...the right-hand hinged tailgate.  When parked against the curb..not very handy.
Honda redeems themselves by allowing you to pop the glass portion separately (either from inside or with the remote), although the liftover is a little high.

So overall, a couple of minor gripes, but they really do pale in comparison with all of the things that great about this vehicle.  I would have no problem recommending the CR-V to anyone.

My only concern is that this is my wife's car and she may not want to let me drive it too often :)

P.S. It says 2002 at the bottom only cause there was no option to select 2003 for the review.
