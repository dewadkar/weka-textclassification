            I bought this car because of the Saturn name and the results I saw from other people(saturn owners). Also I was attracted to saturn for the value
on the vehicles. I was also looking to save money in, gasoline,insurance,
maintenance and monthly payments. I went to alot of car dealers in New Jersey and no one could take my Eagle vision 95, to help me save money!. The Saturn people were so friendly and helpful, and they put all my fears at rest... I bought a 96 Saturn SL, 4 door sedan, cranbury color, 5 speed
and I love it.. I save so much money in gas,insurance, and so on; you name it... Thank you Saturn (rt 1 South) in So. Brunswick, NJ..Anyone looking to save money and drive a cute car should look into a Saturn!<br><br>
