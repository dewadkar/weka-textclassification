            The '99 Civic Si is quite possibly the most perfect compact car.  If you live in California, or any other state in which gas is $2 a gallon on people drive as if have no value for human life, you need a Civic Si.  I get 26 mpg in the city (including spirited driving on the weekends), with 160 hp to boot.

The 1.6-liter engine is a technological marvel producing 100 hp per liter with plenty of torque to spin the tires off the line.  The suspension has been beefed up from the baser Civics with stiffer springs and progressively valved shocks.  The progressive valves provide a firm, smooth, flat-around-the-corners ride.  

Regardless of all the great technical specifications, the Civic Si is a good-looking automobile, especially in Electron Blue Pearl.  And the symphony of sounds the engine emits on its way to the 8,000 rpm redline are sweeter than any concerto.  The car is just plain fun to drive.  It goes when and where you tell it to go and stops on a dime.  I love this car.  You can't find a better car for the money, guaranteed.  If you have around $18,000 to spend on a new car, get the Civic Si.  

To tell you the truth, it's difficult to explain the experience in words, so go drive one yourself.
