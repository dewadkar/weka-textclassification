            Redesigned for 1997, Mirage stood as an entry-level model for Mitsubishi's lineup.  It came in a variety of models to suit a variety of different people.  The base DE model was meant to be basic transportation.  The LS model added more features and a larger engine to create a "sporty" version of the otherwise economical coupe and sedan.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: Though the Mirage was redesigned for 1997, it still looked somewhat similar to previous models (1993-96).  To me, the sedan model looks quite plain when compared to the coupe model.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The best thing about the Mirage would have to be its vast array of features.  My test model (an LS coupe) came fully-loaded with an AM/FM radio, cassette, <b>AND</b> CD player, power door locks, power windows, power mirrors, a keyless entry system, and a whole lot more to list.  My only gripe about the keyless entry system is the fact that it tends to lock itself even with the doors unlocked and the keys still in the ignition.  If I did not have the spare key on hand, this would have caused a MAJOR problem (obviously!).

The seats in the Mirage are very comfortable.  Although I was not able to take the car out on a long drive, I know that if I did, I would come out of the car without any complaints.  Headroom is fine even for tall drivers.  The rear seats, however, are much less hospitable.  Not only is there a shortage of legroom, but a lack of foot space under the front seats make the rear feel very confining.  The sedan would offer more rear seat accomodations due to the fact tht its wheelbase is 3.3 inches longer.

The dashboard and controls are well-placed and easy to read.  The speedometer and other gauges are quite large and do not require you eyes to move far from the road.  Though the interior materials look better than they feel, I would not expect a subcompact to deliver a luxury-car-like build quality.

Though the Mirage's slippery shape keeps wind noise at a minimum, my tester's 185/60HR-14 tires tend to make a LOT a noise especially on rough roads.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The DE model is powered by a 1.5-liter 92-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine.  This powerplant is mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.  Though I was not able to test this particular model, I expect less than leisurely acceleration especially on hills.  A DE sedan with the automatic transmission weighs in at 2,227 pounds.  This may sound light, but considering the fact that it only has 93 lb./ft. of torque, this engine would be best suited to a manual where you have more control over the engine.

My test LS coupe comes standard with a larger 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine.  It puts out 113 horsepower and 116 lb./ft. of torque to the front wheels.  It too comes equipped with either a 5-speed manual or, like my tester, a 4-speed automatic.  Arouund town, the peppy little inline-4 gets all 2304 pounds moving with ease.  Though it won't rip the pavement, there is more than adequate low and midrange torque.  Even on the highway, the engine puts all 113 horsepower to use and can carry the coupe up steep hills without having to put the pedal to the floorboard.

My only complaint is a transmission that <b>loves</b> to let you know that it exists.  Even under light throttle loads, the tranny tends to bump slightly when shifting.  If it gets confused, especially on uphills, when it does downshift it will with an annoying lurch.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The Mirage handles fairly well despite its smallish 14-inch wheels.  The front end does have the tendency to understeer (a lot) in really aggresive driving, but otherwise is actually pretty fun to drive when pushed.  There is body lean in hard cornering, but it's not that bad.  I like the fact that the Mirage is so easy to drive.  Some cars that I have tested require at least a few days to learn how to drive, operate its features, and "get a feel for it".  With the Mirage, however, all you have to do is get in the car, and <b>DRIVE</b>.  The brakes are strong, and comes with anti-lock brakes, though that feature was optional.

<b>RIDE</b>: The Mirage rides fairly well considering the fact that it has a short 95.1-inch wheelbase.  The ride can get to be a bit choppy over broken surfaces, but is not harsh to the point where it gets annoying.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: In general, Japanese cars are reliable.  Other than a remote keyless entry system that seems to have a mind of its own, the owner of the vehicle has had no problems with the car so far.  As stated in the <b>PROS</b> section, the 1997 Mitsubishi Mirage LS Coupe has not received any recalls to date.

<b>VALUE</b>: The Mitsubishi Mirage is a sporty-looking car (at least the coupe is), and has a lot of features for the dollar.  The only major qualm I think any potential buyer would have with the car is its rate of depreciation.  When the owner of the vehicle bought the car in the summer of 1999, the car was barely 2-years old then and cost $13,015.  Now, Blue Book Values (www.kbb.com) have the Mirage like-equipped at only $5,275 MSRP.
