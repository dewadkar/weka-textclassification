            Previously I owned a 1991 Toyota Corolla LE.  I own a 1997 Mazda Miata M-Edition in Marina Green Metallic, with tan interior.  I also own a 2001 BMW M Coupe.

This car will always have a special place in my heart.  The handling is stunning, and the car never fails to put a smile on the driver's face.

Exterior:  The M-Edition paint is beautiful and holds up well.  The styling is classic and confident without being overwrought.  I opted for a rear spoiler and find the rear end anemic looking without it.  The polished wheels look nice at first but tend to pit over time.  The windshield glass must be thin or something because this car is especially prone to rock chips on the front windshield.

Interior:  Small.  The leather is durable and not exactly supple.  The seating position and ergonomics are perfect, even for my 6'2" frame with 33" inseam.  The A/C is absurdly powerful for this size car.  Wind noise is fatiguing with the top up or down.

Build quality: This car is rock solid.  I NEVER had any problems with this car.  It only saw the shop for routine maintenance.  Think about how often you still see a 1st generation Miata on the road.  Its a testament to their quality.

Performance:  The handling is superb, the engine is adequate for the car, but once accustomed, most want more power.  While true, its plenty powerful for the size car, traffic conditions, and 99% of passing situations.

Amenities:  The premium sound system is great, it almost never skips.  I miss having headrest speakers in my subsequent cars.  With the top down, life is good.  

Now that I've got the BMW M Coupe, the Miata will probably be used for track days.  Another intangible plus is the fabulous owner's club for support and advice.
