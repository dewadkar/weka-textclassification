            I had a friend who drove a Kia Sportage as a rental car and it got me interested in the car.  I went to a Kia dealer and within two hours, I had bought a brand new Kia 2000 Sportage EX. 
I love the look of the car...not too big, not too small.  I love the four-wheel drive and the bonus features (sliding elbow rest pad, lumbar support, knee airbag, keyless entry).
I do not like the fact that the rear wiper does not have an intermittent feature. I do not like the gas mileage.  The sticker said 19/22 but I have been getting approximately 16-18.  I do not like the horn. It is in the middle of the wheel and I can't get it to work without really pushing hard in the right spot, which is not conducive to using it in a panic or while trying to get someone's attention right away.
Driving the car on flat roads is great.  It's smooth and effortless.  However, given any sort of incline, the Sportage struggles a bit.  I know it's not meant to be a race car but it really takes some pedal power (and gas!) to get it up some fairly mild hills.  Also, when the engine feels like it has been exerting itself for awhile, a fan kicks in. It is great for safety but horrible for sound and comfort level.  
The car should be driven by someone who needs the four-wheel drive, does not have tall friends who will sit in the back, and does not live in a very hilly area.  It is functional for now, but I don't see myself keeping it for very long.  For the price ($21,000 after all the extras) and especially what I'll be paying in the long run ($30,000), I would have rather purchased a car with better mileage and power.  However, since I live in the snowbelt of New York, I think I'll drive it in the winter for safety. Overall, a good purchase, but not a long term keeper.
