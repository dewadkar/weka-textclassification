            I bought my Chrysler Sebring for many reasons, but mainly because of the sleek look. There are not many coupes out there that can even compare with the Sebring (ok maybe the Avenger).

I love how this car can take corners (even when it is stock). The V-6 is nice but Chrysler/Mitsubishi could have put in a bigger displacement engine in the Sebring. 

The inside of the car WOW (O&amp;A WOW) lots of room I am a little over 6feet and i have plenty of leg room. and the seats you can fall asleep easily in them.
What more do i have to say!!???

Take it from a proud owner with 175,000+ hard driving miles on the car, The Sebring is a really reliable car!
