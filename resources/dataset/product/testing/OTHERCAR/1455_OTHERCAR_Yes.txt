            In 1996 I purchased a Red SC1. I do not like talking and haggling about car prices but I needed a new car bad as the on I had was dying. I looked at a few local car lots and was constantly aggravated by salespeople. so I went to Saturn. They were really nice from the start they said hello and told me if I saw something I like let them know after about 20 Minutes and they didn't come back I went to them I talked with them about what I wanted and what they had and could get but since it was going to take 2 weeks for them to get the color I wanted I chose red because I really didn't care about color and the car I had was about dead. During the test drive the salesman told me to really test drive the car not just drive it. Boy! did it have more take off power than I expected. I have not ha any problems with the car since I bought it(mechanically) There are two things which I have noticed that are the 1996 model SC1s seem to have in common and that is that there is a strange rattling in the passenger side dashboard and that after about two to three years the paint where the windows roll down flakes off but that's it. Saturn also has treated me well in customer care. They have always took good care of the care when in for oil changes and stuff and when I went in to get a spare key made after three years it was free. that was totally unexpected. I love the car its great for short trips and going back in forth from home to work. It gets decent gas mileage too. It isn't something you would want if you are on a long trip or if you need a lot of room in a car though but for a reasonably priced car and people who are just going to ride around town or make few long trips then it would be a great car.<br><br>
