            The 1996 Toyota 4-Runner that we have is a great SUV. First of all I would like to say that it is a SUV, not like the Lexus &quot;SUV&quot; the 4-Runner is built on a truck chassis. This gives it a towing capacity of 5000 lbs to the Lexus's 3500. Because it is built on a truck chassis it rides like a truck, it is no Cadillac, and no one should expect it to be. We haul our boat,which weighs 4000 lbs, with it just about every weekend and it does great. It has never had a problem. Of course you can feel a difference, but you can also tell that it is made to tow, and not to be a car. The 4 wheel drive system works great, we have never had any problems with getting stuck in mud or snow or anything else. Driving this car you also feel safe, it doesn't feel top heavy, as if it will roll over at any time, and it's size would keep you safe in a collision, I feel. This is a wonderful vehicle and it would be my top SUV choice for the 28,000-35,000 dollar price range any day.<br><br>
