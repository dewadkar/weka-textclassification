            Every time I get behind the wheel of my 2000 Legacy GT, I feel that i'm in a safe and reliable car.  All wheel drive is the best drive a person can have.  I live in the Northwest, it does rain a lot, and my Legacy stays true to its advertising and sticks to the ground.  In dry weather, the AWD system can be appreciated still because in the event of a hard turn or in an emergency situation, the AWD kicks in and control is kept.  That's the best thing about the car, it helps prevent accidents from happening.  It received the highest speed in emergency turning at 65 mph, and the brakes are well equipped to stop.  The interior is great for this price as well.  Spacious in the front, okay in the back.  I like the engine too, it provides low end torque and that provides great acceleration.

The only problems that I have with this car are that the stereo is great if you sit in the front, but once you sit in the back seat, you can't hear anything.  There aren't any speakers in the back besides the doors. I would also like to see a more powerful engine too.  Compared to other cars of its size and price it has the least horsepower, but if you want a 4 cylinder engine because of gas economy, go with this one.<br><br>
