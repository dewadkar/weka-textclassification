            Imperial. Just say it: 'Imperial'.

According to Webster's:
of, relating to, befitting, or suggestive of an empire or an emperor  
2 a : SOVEREIGN b : REGAL, IMPERIOUS
3 : of superior or unusual size or excellence

I think there is hardly more to say about these fantastic machines.
My favorite car above all always was, is and will be the 1961 Imperial.
I'm an avid Imperial collector and once owned a 61 Crown Southampton Hardtop. It became a victim of my divorce but I still remember this car like a lost child.
Currently I have a 1966 Imperial LeBaron and despite it needs restoration, it still, even in its tatty condition, is a stately car making an impact on everybody who sees it just by it's presence. It has all the options that were available, including dual air conditioning, auto-pilot and even power vent windows. I would always prefer an Imperial to any comparable Cadillac or Lincoln, just to demonstrate that I dare to be different. The late fifties to mid seventies Imperials were Chrysler's attempt to make it an individual make, and despite their limited production, uniqueness in design (they stuck to body-on-frame-construction for one-and-a-half decades after Chrysler switched to unibody design for their lesser cars), superior quality, ride and performance, they were never recognized as such by the public. It was always 'Chrysler Imperial'. As if you would say 'Ford Lincoln'. That makes them even more desirable if you value individuality above all. They are tremendously underrated in today's collector's market and downright cheap wheels.
When Chrysler revived the 'Imperial' make in the early nineties, the cars had lost a lot of the original's attributes. Despite that, Chrysler managed still to make them unmistakeable for anything else. They are 'dare to be different' in Chrysler's grand tradition and I trust they are the most comfortable in their class. I would buy one instantly -if I wouldn't own one already.
