            My husband and I bought this vehicle because I have always been a Plymouth person.  Granted I was only 22 at the time of purchase, my family always bought Plymouths so I have been partial to them.  We purchased this car, after looking at other makes and models, as a program car in 1997.

I like the size of the car because it is not too small, nor is it too big.  The size of the trunk is perfect for when we go on vacations or trips to the family because we can fit the stroller plus our luggage inside.

I also like the fact the the car's cigarette lighter jack is on even if the car is not.  It is perfect for me to let my phone charge up while the engine is off in case of emergencies.

The one thing I hate about this car is the location of the battery.  What were they thinking when they designed this car?  My husband and I have fun quizzing people about it's location.  You have to take the driver's front tire off the car in order to get to it!  However they did make it convenient for you if you have to jump start it by putting the positive and negative connectors in view in the engine compartment.

The drive of the vehicle is great.  I have never had any problems with it, other then the anti-lock breaks kicking in on dry pavement once and a while when I stop.  I love the feel of it when it drives on the interstate.  The ride is so smooth.  When my husband drives I am lulled asleep to the quiet hum of the road beneath.

The people who should buy this car are those who want lots of trunk space and plenty of leg room.  This car is perfect for families because of these reasons.  I cannot think of anyone who should not buy this car.<br><br>
