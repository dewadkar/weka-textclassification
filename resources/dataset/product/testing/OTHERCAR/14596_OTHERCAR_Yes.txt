This vehicle reeks of overall goodness. With 177,000 miles, it's extremely reliable and comfortable. It's still fun to drive. The engine uses no oil between changes (every 3,000 miles), gets 35 m.p.g on the highway, and purrs like a kitten. The brakes have been done once. The tires last for 75,000 miles per set. I may have to replace the clutch in the next few months, but it's original and I used to tow a 1,200 lb. camping trailer with this car. And to top it off, I have had wonderful experience with each of three Honda dealers that have serviced it.

Dislikes:
It stands between me and buying a new car! I won't get rid of it until it becomes unreliable, which does not appear to be in the near future. Only one real annoyance: The cruise control has always been slow to engage, although it holds speed fairly well once set.  The heater knobs have a tendency to strip but, hey, they're $4.50 each.  The power antenna had to be replaced (not a big deal) as well.  The only problem endemic to this model seems to be the distributor, but I can't get too riled up about it since it didn't fail until 120,000 miles.


It boils down to this: I feel like I'm pulling a "fast one" on the rest of the commuting public by driving this car. Living in SUV-crazy Detroit, I chuckle smugly when I think how little I pay for transportation compared to my neighbors. First, the car goes a long way on a gallon of gas. Second, every time I take it to the dealer for scheduled maintenance (about which I am vigilant) I end up spending less than I had planned. Nothing major ever goes wrong, and the service manager has talked me out of having discretionary things done on more than one occasion. Third, I no longer insure it because of its low book value, so it reduces my ownership cost even further. Of course, I get some razzing at the office because I'm at a level where I really should not be driving this old vehicle (I get a car allowance).  I've promised this car to my daughter when she turns sixteen, and she's only seven now. I'm fairly confident that I'll be able to keep my promise!

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2002:
My Accord has now passed 200,000 miles and continues to be annoyingly dependable.  I took a 5,000 mile trip out west with my daughter this summer and never thought twice about reliability.  We'd cruise across South Dakota doing 90/90, i.e., 90 MPH with the A/C keeping us cool in 90 degree weather.  No problems, no complaints.

I only had one repetitive problem:  Every 500 miles or so I'd have to stop to fill up the tank.  We averaged 32 MPG during the trip.

I did have to get my muffler replaced again last month, but Midas provided it for free since they had installed the last one.  The original clutch still refuses to slip.  I may be stuck with this thing forever!
