            If you are really thinking about great photo images, make sure you get a camera that provides at least 2.1 mega pixels and 1600x1200 resolution with adjustable white balance and an adjustable shutter speed as well.

The DC 215 is great for close up shots to about 5 feet in good lighting. But, even with the exposure at the maximum 2.0 setting, your night shots are blurred and jagged with distortion from the lens. I bought a 48 meg compact flash card for it and can take 745 pictures on low resolution (645x480)! On high res I can take 226 (1152x884). That's a huge benefit for the average shot taker like I used to be. But now I am into shots that I need clarity at 25 feet and beyond and my little "I think I can" just can't.  Remember, the greater the resolution your camera supports, the higher the image quality but also fewer pictures can be taken.  I.E.  The kodak 290 can only manage 106 shots at high resolution where as the DC 215 can manage 226.  Lower resolution requires less space on the camera card.

Also, Kodakï¿½s have been known to eat batteries as snacks if you leave the view finder on. Depending on which batteries you use (I use energizer Titanium), digestion will begin in less than 25 minutes.  Don't use the view finder, your shots will be more stable and clearer anyways.

Its got some scaled down features of the big boys like deleting photos you don't want after you take them, auto/adjustable white balance, macro capability, picture preview and borders. 

But, if you're trying to take shots at the Daytona 500, don't count on clear shots, there's no programmable shutter to capture fast moving objects. 

Between it's inability to manage the white balance in darker settings, over saturation of white balance in sunny settings and lack of shutter control, this unit remains a starter cam for those who need something just for the family.
