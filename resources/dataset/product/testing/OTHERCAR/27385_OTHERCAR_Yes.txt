            Ok, it was never said I was easy to please. After 5 months of looking for the perfect car, I decided on the Dodge Caravan. Why?

This was my first Van. I had driven a Dodge Shadow for years with no problems (and I still have it), so I was pretty sure I wanted another Dodge, BUT, I am woman, I kept changing my mind. (THIS IS what happens when husbands tell their wives, go pick out what you want, I will come sign when you find it.) SOOOOOOOOOOO anyway, I finally went into the Dodge Dealership after receiving a coupon in the mail for 700.00 toward a down payment. WOW, with  the 2500.00 rebate, that would be less I would have to put down, and more to spend filling up the Van with useless junk, that would never fit in my Dodge Shadow.


Now for my experience at the dealership and my new van.

I got to the dealership and there were lots of salespeople hanging around lying in wait. A nice lady approached me and I told her I was looking for a simple Dodge Caravan, since this was my first Van. I wanted nothing fancy, just something to get the kids around. I also told her the colors I did not want, white or red. She actually listened to me. She told me we could test drive a white one, but they had just had some new ones in other colors delivered off the truck.

I finally decided on a Patriot Pearl Metallic Blue. The inside is a taupe colored cloth. IT had a whopping 2 miles on it!!! Needless to say, this was the one I wanted. It was simple, no power locks or windows. I hate power locks and windows and rarely do you find cars these days without them. That was one of my MAIN things. It has two sliding doors. This was another feature that was important to me. Having Kids, I wanted to be able to access them from both sides if need be. (OK, SO I ADMIT, I am a TAD BIT lazy.)
My other requirement was tinted windows. 

I was also concerned about using lots of fuel. Gas mileage is 18 for city and 24 for Hwy. That was not too bad in my eyes. 

<b>The standard Equipment that comes with the Dodge Caravan</b>

<i>Air Bags-Front, Next Gen,Multistage, Door LT sliding with glass, Child Seat Anchor System, Latch Ready, Brakes-Power Front Disc/Rear Drum, Steering- Power Rack and Pinion, Brake/Park Interlock, Headlamps-Halogen, Rear and front windshield wipers,Alternator, Battery Fuel Tank, Spare Tire.</i>
Now this was the list on the sticker, in easy terms, it has brakes, a fuel tank, lights, doors, windshield wipers. Which was all I needed to know.    

<b>Interior</b>
This was also listed in fancy terms, but I will tell you all the important stuff. It seats 7. The seats roll out easily for a place to put those big purchases! It has an AM/FM radio with cassette, although I don't own any cassettes. I will have to replace this with a CD player. 

<b>Exterior</b>

Fold away mirrors, tinted glass, all season tires. 


<b>Optional Equipment</b>

To my shock and surprise, my engine a 3.3 L V6 was OPTIONAL. I always thought an engine was standard! Speed control and tilt steering column (I am only 5'4" so this was important, being able to control the steering wheel). I also got Sunscreen on the glass and a rear defroster on my window.( I also thought that the rear defroster was standard) Silly me.


Now since I have never bought a vehicle on my own and my husband thought I should do it to experience it, I really am simple and wanted simple. That is what I got and was very happy with it. He also thought I did a fairly good job, except he thought I should have gotten power windows and doors. 

Getting in and out of this Van is easy. I have yet to hit my head or anything like I did with my Shadow. The seats are comfortable and there is lots of leg room. Driving for a short person like me, great in this Van. I don't have to sit so close to the steering wheel,and I can actually see over the dashboard! Loading and unloading children is easy. They can handle the sliding doors with ease. The rear door was the only thing that took a while to get used to. It is quite heavy to pull down and lifts up kind of high. So I have to stretch to reach the handle to close it.


All in all, I was quite pleased with my Van. I was amazed at the purchasing process. I went to the dealership at 5 and had my Van that evening about 9. I never realized how much time you spend by yourself at a dealership though. Next time I will bring a book.
