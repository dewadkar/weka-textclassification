            I bought the Mercury Sable LS Wagon because I have a 10yr old stepdaughter and a new born baby. I only wanted full size because of the third seat. What's a wagon without extra room?

It is more than a family car, it's a great place for shopping/groceries and utility usage also.  How many cars can you say have room for a ladder in the back. The middle seat folds down in 2 sections for convenience.  The third seat in back folds up for convenience...and for a 10yr old and friends to escape the world of a newborn carseat.

It drives like a car,not a van. I also don't have to take in and out the last seat for storage. 

I have the leather interior, which is great!  I never thought I would like leather on a car seat, but I love it...and if a child gets messy it is easy to clean up.

The only problem I noticed is the rack up top of the car split on one rack..all covered under warranty.

I would definatly recommend the Mercury Sable LS Wagon.
