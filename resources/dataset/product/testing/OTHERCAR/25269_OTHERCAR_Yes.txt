            The reason for my purchase of this vehicle I need some thing for the commute from school to work to home. Where I live is very deepened on the car you drive they look at that. If I were to get some thing that was equal but not Japanese I would have a hard time in not only getting parts but also, finding some one to put those parts into my car. That would be my big problem and one of the majors chooses in deciding what I was going to buy. My loves of the car are the large wheelbase was one that is not over looked it gives a sense on security. From those other tall Sport Util-Vehicles on the market in this cars Range. The one thing that I hated the most about this car was the Dealers they were the worst bunch of dealers in the free world. They had no respect for any body but the people that they thought had money. I like driving it's a dream it has such much power to its name. They have it all backed up with a great four wheel drive system that makes a great combo. Every one should think about looking at this vehicle if they have the means. That would be the one reason I would not suggest it to other is the high price is not for every on to afford.<br><br>
