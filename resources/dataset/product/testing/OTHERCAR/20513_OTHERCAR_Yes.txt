            At the end of March 2003, I purchased a brand new car for the first time in my life.  I started off which crappy hand me down American made cars when I was younger and finally ended up trading my old 1990 Accord EX for a few bucks off the new 2003 4DR Ex.  What can I say?  I'm hard-stuck on Honda.

The car (being the top of the line Civic) comes with AC, Gorgeous Neon Blue Backlit instrument panels, 4 decently sized speakers (6.5's in front and 6X9's in the back), mud flaps, sunroof/moonroof, sunroof visor, chrome paneling all over the place (inside and out), keyless entry and several other amenities
<b>The Ride</b>
I've noticed that several people here have said that the car is  a bit on the bumpy side.  I'm going to have to agree that the car is not the most smooth ride, but that the bumpy issue is not severe enough to be any real problem.

It accelerates, thats about all I can say.  You'll have no problem merging or getting on and off highways in a safe fashion.  Are you going to win a race? - No.  Are you going to outrun the cops? - Hell no.  So, don't try.  If you're looking for a sports car, buy the S2000, not the Honda Civic.  If you've watched the Fast and the Furious and you think you're car is going to come chockfull of modifications, you're an idiot. :)

<b>Comfortable?</b>

Well, yes and no.  I'm 5'9" and not too heavy in the weight department.  The car is plenty big enough on the inside for someone of my stature.  If you play for the Atlanta Falcons, you might want to consider something more luxurious and spacious - like a Hummer.  

The seats are comfortable enough.  They aren't fancy leather and they aren't something you'd want to sit in for 24 straight hours - but they serve their purpose.

<b>Style</b>

The car looks nice.  It's headlights, the superfluous chrome, tail lights, moon/sunroof, interior gauges - all pretty impressive.  Let us not forget to mention the gleaming "H" symbol in the front of the car that reminds everyone that "yes" you are driving a Honda. :)

<b>Chick Magnet?</b>

Naw, probably not.  I mean, if I put some nice rims on the car, got the car tinted, added a "bumpin'" stereo system, sold my soul and than got one of the 2,000 body kits to throw on my car - then, ... maybe.  Oh, did I mention a ridiculously huge spoiler and a tail pipe the size of 3 tennis balls?  Vrrrooom, baby, Vrrrooooom.  

<b>Overall</b>

This car is an amazing car.  It is a Honda, it's the utmost in reliable.  It has pickup, but is in no fashion a sports car.  What can I say? My Silver Civic looks great, runs smoothly and keeps me smiling every time I hop into it.

If you're looking for a 4 DR Sedan that is going to be consistently reliable for years to come, this is the car for you.  If you want something that is reasonable, but has a bit of pickup this car is for you.  If you think you're going to get hot asian woman because you've seen the Fast and the Furious too many times - this car is <i>not</i> for you.
