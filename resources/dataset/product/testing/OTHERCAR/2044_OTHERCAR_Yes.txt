            I have had the pleasure of driving my parents' 1997 Cadillac Seville STS and have to say that the first word to come to mind is--awesome!

They have driven several different Cadillacs over the years, but then after a brief stint with Pontiac Bonneville SSEI's, returned to Cadillac with the STS.

My father and I discussed a few of the points that make this car so nice:
1.  the Northstar engine is extremely smooth and reliable-absolutely no problems.  
2.  the Delco sound system has continued to sound excellent.  It is apparent that the engineers have tuned it specifically for this car.  When you can sit in the driver's seat and the sound appears to come from within your own head--that's cool!
3.  touring in this has to rank with the best from Germany or Japan.  Absolutely quiet and smooth with nothing to make the trip tiring.
4.  Looks--still looks awesome after 150k+ miles.

Downsides--boy, that would be hard to name...

They plan on keeping the car &quot;forever&quot;.  If they ever change their mind-I have first dibs.
