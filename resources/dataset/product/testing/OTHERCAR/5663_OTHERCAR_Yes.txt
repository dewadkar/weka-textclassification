            I've owned the S330 for several months now, and have had nothing but success with it. In fact, a friend was visiting from out of town, and after seeing photos from the S330, made me write down the model number for her so she could buy one.

The Powershot S330 "Digital Elph" is a small, very substantial feeling camera that makes very nice images. The outer body is mostly of stainless steel for durability. 

Controls are well placed for even large fingers to access. There is nothing that comes close to needing a pencil or pen to activate. The lens zoom controls are located where your thumb can find them naturally, and are sizable enough so you don't zoom in when you mean to zoom out. On the lower rear side of the camera, there are four settings buttons, and to the right of the display is a circular button arrangement with four more buttons. The spacing between all buttons is ample. The shutter release button is sizable, and well-placed for one's forefinger.

The lens provides excellent sharpness, contrast, and color reproduction. It has a protective shutter that covers the glass when the camera is turned off. F stop range is 2.7-4.7, which is fast enough for a camera aimed at the non-pro user.

Two lights adjacent to the eyepiece provide focus confirmation and flash ready information. Yes, using the eyepiece with the LCD display turned off is a very good way to conserve battery power.

The small lithium ion battery provides very good usability in my opinion. Using the LCD to review or frame pictures and using the zoom control will diminish the batteries faster, of course. Having an extra battery would be advisable, especially if you're traveling. The included battery charger is fantastic. You just pop the battery into the unit, and the unit plugs directly into an AC socket - there is no wire to fuss with. The AC prongs fold into the unit when not in use, making packing the charger even easier.

I bought Canon's suede case for the S330. The case fits perfectly, and provides a small zippered compartment for your extra battery and an extra CompactFlash card.

Since the camera is rated at 2.1 megapixels, you could pop in a 128K memory card and shoot all weekend with room to spare. The downside is that you're limited in the size of photo enlargements. There isn't enough data in the image to create anything of quality bigger than about 5X7 inches. To me, that's not too limiting for a camera that excels at family snapshots and vacation pics.

The S330 went with us on vacation to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and New York city with nary a glitch. Photos were wonderful. It's such a blessing to NOT be toting a 35mm camera with extra lenses while you're walking so much. The S330 dangling from your wrist is not much of a burden at all.
