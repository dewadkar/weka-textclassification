            I received this camera as a gift and fell in love with it after the first use.It has a screen on the back that lets you see what you are shooting, and after you are done taking the picture, you can review it onscreen as well, cycling through all the pictures you took. You can also delete the pictures you don't want, saving valuable memory. It has built in flash, and is a nice size, not too heavy. It is incredibly easy to use. I am not a techie by any means, but it is very easy for me to use. The directions that come with it are easy to understand, and the photograph software is quite simple to use as well. It also has enough memory to hold many pictures, and you can buy memory upgrades for it. Eight  megabytes can hold up to thirty pictures.
   The only con is that it does go through batteries quite quickly. I have found that the Energizer E squared titanium batteries work the best. They seem to give the camera the longest life. Buying batteries can get pricey after a while, but you have to keep in mind all the money you save in film and developing costs. I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a good digital camera that won't cost an arm and a leg.
