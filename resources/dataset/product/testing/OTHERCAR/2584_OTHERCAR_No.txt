            I wish I knew about epinions in November 2000, when we started looking for a minivan.  I could have saved thousands of dollars by avoiding this beast I am now writing about.

We bought a 1995 Grand Voyager SE with 98,000 miles on it.  The previous owner had purchased it in late '95 with 25,000 miles on it.  It used to be a rental car, which should be a red flag, but we figured that all the problems have come up by now and have been fixed by the previous owners.

We knew that these vehicles were notorious for transmission problems, but this one just had it replaced 23,000 miles ago.  The van had been "well taken care of" and had plenty of power and leaked nothing.  We figured we were safe.

The van came with service records, and we were foolish enough not to review them ALL before buying it (or NOT buying it, as we should have done).

After it was too late, we found out that the original transmission went out at 25,000 miles.  The replacement went out at 75,000 miles.  The transmission we bought the van with went out three months later, at 101,000 miles.  The dealer had just serviced it and did not bother telling us about all the junk that was in the fluid when they changed it.

So technically this van is on its FOURTH transmission now, with only 106,000 miles on the whole vehicle.

In the mean time we had to replace the water pump, tensioner and serpentine belt.  The brakes are worn out.  The A/C has never worked for us.  There is a clunk somewhere in the suspension.  And to make matters worse, the cylinder head is now cracked, despite the fact that we never let the van overheat and always took care of it.

In the 2 years and 8 months that we have owned the cursed vehicle, it spent 1 year and 8 months sitting in the driveway waiting for us to come up with more money to repair this and that.  I think it is time to give up on it, but it sure hurts to think that we have spent $10,000 on a pretty storage box on wheels.

I guess I will mention the fact that the van is quite nice to drive when it runs, it is powerful and handles pretty well.  It is not as quiet as I would expect a newer vehicle to be, and the seats could use improvement in the back support and arm rest department.  I am average height (5'5") and my knees are pressed against the steering column when I drive.  The seat belts are height adjustable, but still too tall even in the lowest position, resting not on my collar bone but on my neck.

I can not finish this review without writing something good about this vehicle.  It does have one ingenious feature: the middle bench seat has built in child safety seats.  This detail would be great for grandparents who take care of a couple of toddlers once in a while: they could safely transport the precious cargo without the hassle of installing car seats into their vehicle each time they have the kids over for a visit.

I hope this review will help those looking for a used van.  I have heard of Grand Voyagers that last a long time without problems, but they are rare and it is safer to stay away from them all together.
