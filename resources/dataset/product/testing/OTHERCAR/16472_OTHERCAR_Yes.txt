            I now have two children, and my wife wants a third in a couple of years, so I suspect I will not be able to put off buying a minivan for much longer. Already my wife and I engage in a casual, at most half-serious debate on who will have to drive it. At some point, this debate will become fully serious, perhaps even violent. She simply doesn�t want the �Mommymobile.� I�d like to think I�m not so bound up in image (right). But I currently greatly enjoy driving, and would hate to have to drive a vehicle with less than stellar responses and handling. I suspect we represent thousands of other couple in this resistance. Has DaimlerChrysler done anything to mitigate such resistance?

In case I lost the battle with my wife, I have recently taken a look at the DaimlerChrysler minivans, which have been redesigned for 2001. I drove the Chrysler Town & Country first. (Last week I posted a review of that minivan, but under 2000 because the 2001 listing was not up yet. That review shares about two-thirds of its content with this review.) The Town & Country was a very nice minivan, but the test drive didn't leave me willing to give up my sports sedan. I greatly enjoy driving, and though it road and handled very well for such a large vehicle I cannot say I got a thrill out of driving it. In contrast, I enjoy driving my current car just about every time I get into it, even if it's just a run to the store.

In a last ditch effort to find a minivan I would enjoy driving, I took a look at the Dodge as well. The Grand Caravan and Town & Country are essentially the same vehicle, but the Dodge is intended to be a bit sportier. For 2001 this has been further emphasized by offering only Sport and ES trims with the Grand Caravan. The major differences between the Dodge and the Chrysler concern the front end styling, wheels, and some interior details. Well, there are two potentially important differences. In an attempt to appeal to people like myself, who fancy sporty cars and strongly resist buying a minivan, the top-of-the-line Grand Caravan, the ES, has Autostick standard and 17" wheels optional. These features combine with the sportier styling of the Dodge to make it the sportiest available minivan. But is it sporty enough?

When I tested the Town & Country (in mid-level LXi trim), I was surprised by the price, a bit over $34,000. At the time I wondered if the Dodge might cost less. Well, maybe if you got the lower-level Sport trim or got less on it. But in ES trim, with the same options the Chrysler had plus the 17" wheels (available only on the FWD ES), the Dodge costs <b> more </b>. To be precise, $34,890. And that's leaving a few expensive features, such as all-wheel-drive and a dealer-installed entertainment center on the table. So, if you take off the wheels, which are $680 if ordered as an individual option, the two vans are priced within a few dollars of one another. So, if you want a loaded DaimlerChrysler minivan, you won't be making your decision based on price.

What did this price include? Well, all of the new features for 2001: dual power sliding doors (standard on the ES), a power liftgate, and a movable and removable center console. For a (perhaps too( detailed discussion of these, see my Town & Country review.

Still missing off the features list is a third row seat that folds flat into the floor. Honda and Mazda offer this feature already, and GM is supposed to add it for 2001, though I have not seen it yet. This feature provides for a lot of cargo room without removing any seats. DaimlerChrysler for whatever reason passed. You can flip the third row seats forward, but if you want to clear the rear area you�ll have to remove them as before. They aren�t too difficult to get out and put back in once you figure out the three-step process. Still, this is tedious, especially given the approximately 50 pound weight of each half and the space they take up in your garage. Any bets for how many years it�ll be before an into-the-floor seat appears in the DaimlerChrysler minivans?

Additional new details include headlights large enough to do some good (mid-90s Chrysler design all suffered from overly small and all-around inadequate headlights), lots of sizable air vents, for superior ventilation, and the availability of a touring suspension. 

For 2001, the Grand Caravan also has been substantially restyled. The 1996 design revolutionized minivan design. With aggressive bulges over the wheels, hidden door tracks, flush side glass, and a sloped rear window, it was far more stylish than any previous minivan. In comparison, the 2001 is just evolutionary. Though all of the metal you see is new, much of what you don't see appears to have been carried over. As far as I can tell, the glass has all been carried over as well. So the size and proportions are virtually the same (with the exception of a front end that was extended three inches to improve crash safety). The most substantial change is that the wheel flares are gone, replaced by a prominent undercut groove running the length of the vehicle. The ends of the van have been given a touch more style (in part to allow for those larger lights), but many people are unlikely to be able to tell the difference except from the side. Overall, some sportiness have been exchanged for a more upscale appearance. Nearly everyone will still find it very stylish for a minivan. In my opinion it maintains the DaimlerChrysler minivans� position as the best looking on the market. 

The Grand Caravan shares all of its metal with the Town & Country, so their appearance differs in the grille, trim, and wheels only. Given these limitations, they've done a good job creating minivans with two different characters. The Chrysler looks very sophisticated and upscale, while the Dodge looks aggressively sporty, at least with the massive-spoked 17" wheels. 

The interior has similarly been restyled for a more upscale look. The Chrysler version borrows a few cues from the successful 300M. The gauges have cream faces and numerals in a classic watch-type font. The leather has a heavy grain that resembles that of some fine furniture. I find these the most appealing aspects of the interior design. The Dodge has white-faced gauges with a plain font, a more conventional grain to its leather, and a two-tone dash. Not as nice as the Chrysler in my book.

(The next few paragraphs are nearly identical to the same material in the Town & Country review.)

Aside from the gauges, leather, and darker color for the upper portion of the dash on the Dodge, the interiors of the two vans are identical. The dash is a clean, conservative design that puts the controls where you�d like them but breaks no new ground aesthetically. Now that I think of it, with all of these features this van has tons of buttons. It's quite an achievement that it's easy to figure out where the controls for each feature are and operate them. There is some fake wood on the dash and doors, but it looks close enough to real and there�s not too much of it. On a functional level, the aforementioned large vents, three zone climate control, and the plethora of storage spaces (including bins under a few of the seats) are very welcome. 

A lot of attention appears to have been given to the placement of speakers throughout the interior. It cannot be easy to provide sound for such a large interior, but this ten speaker Infinity system does well based on my (admittedly not picky) ears. I do wonder why the optional four disc CD changer is a separate unit mounted under the climate controls, when many cars this year have a six CD changer integral with the stereo.

Less successful is the seating. The front seats are very supportive and comfortable. Their bolsters gripped me better than those in many of the sports sedans I�ve recently driven. Visibility all around could not be better, with a low beltline, relatively thin pillars, and acres of glass. No complaints from me about anything in the front seat. But I should note that I positioned the seat all the way back even though I�m only 5�9�. Taller drivers will have to raise it if they want to stretch out their legs. Plentiful headroom should allow this.

The problem is that with the driver�s seat all the way back legroom is woefully lacking in the second row. This surprised me, since this was the long wheelbase van. Part of the problem is that there is no room for feet under the first row seats. I assume that making the second row seats higher off the floor, so a passenger�s legs wouldn�t have to stick so far out, would have caused other problems. Perhaps I should have taken the driver�s seat up instead of back? I didn�t really want to sit any higher, but if I want my second row passengers to be comfortable I guess this is what I�d have to do. Taller drivers would not have this option. It�s a shame, since the seats themselves are shaped much like those in front and are very comfortable aside from limited legroom.

One thing that would help (aside from providing room for feet under the front seats) would be a fore-aft adjustment for the second row seats. Some GM minivans used to have this feature, and perhaps still do. Why not here?

The third row is a mixed bag. Since it is a split bench, of course it�s not as comfortable as the second row captain�s chairs. Especially not for any middle passenger, who would straddle a split complete with perceivable hinges. But there�s more legroom back there than in the second row, both because there�s just enough room to squeeze your toes under the second row and, if this isn�t quite comfy, you can stretch your legs between the captains� chairs as long as the console isn�t mounted there. It�s odd that the less comfortable row has more legroom.

In some ways I suspect the rear seats are being designed with the idea that only humans with short legs, i.e. children, will ever sit back there. This seems misguided. At least half of all minivans are bought by people without young children, whether for the cargo space or for the ability to carry three couples at once without anyone having to sit in the middle. Older people find these vehicles especially easy to get in and out of. So it�s time to design the rear seats for adults.

Cargo room is very generous. There�s even a decent amount of space behind the third seat, which has hooks for grocery bags on its back (such nice little features can be found everywhere inside this van). If you bother to remove all of the rear seats, there are supposedly 167 cubic feet of space back there, the most of any minivan by a sizable margin. And don�t think of matching this kind of capacity with an SUV. Even the gargantuan Ford Excursion contains only 146 cubic feet, and the new Acura MDX, a potential minivan competitor given its seven passenger seating, cannot even hold half as much. 

The Dodge I drove, like the Chrysler, had the currently most powerful engine, a 3.8 liter that produces 215 horsepower. This represents a significant increase from the 180 this engine produced in the 2000 minivan. In a few months the 3.5 liter from the large cars will be available, and it will produce 230 peak horsepower but about the same amount through the midrange. So I would expect the difference in performance to be negligible. As it was, the 3.8 moved the minivan about as quickly as I�d probably ever want a minivan to go. It pulled away strongly from a stop and was responsive up to highway speeds. It�s not an especially quiet engine when pushed, sounding much like other OHV American V6s, but the noise is not objectionable. Torque steer is absent. The transmission shifts smoothly. Nothing inspiring about this powertrain performance, but it�s just about ideal for this sort of vehicle. No surprises in either direction. 

(End common material)

Unlike the Town & Country, the Grand Caravan ES has the Autostick feature. This allows you to manually upshift and downshift the transmission. In Dodge cars the Autostick feature works by pushing the shifter to the left or right. Since the shifter in the Grand Caravan is on the steering column rather than on a console, manual shifting is done using a button on the shifter. Supposedly this makes the transmission like a manual, just without a clutch. This type of automatic hasn't done much for me in other vehicles, and it doesn't do a lot here. I'm just not sure I'd ever use this feature. Because the feedback provided by a clutch and manual shifter is missing, operation of these manumatics is much less intuitive. In my test drives I've found I have to think too much about when to shift, and end up just putting the shifter in "D" and leaving it there. 

My experience was much the same in the Grand Caravan, except that I could not bring myself to drive it in a manner that I would want to manually shift gears in the first place. Where this feature might come in handy is in the mountains, when you want to hold a lower gear to increase engine braking or maintain the balance of the chassis through a tight curve. In this scenarios, using the Autostick is easier than using the shifter to select and hold a lower gear. Unfortunately, hills are rare where I live, much less mountains.

The Grand Caravan had the same touring suspension the Town & Country. It provides decent handling, especially given the size and weight (about 4200 lbs.) of this vehicle. But you'll never mistake it for a sports car, or even a sports sedan, 17" wheels or not. There's just way to much understeer for that, and you never lose the sense you're driving a <b> really big vehicle </b> . That said, it�s actually something of an achievement that you never feel like you�re driving such a huge vehicle. Nothing inspiring, but definitely competent and safe. I�ll even go out on a limb and can it �maneuverable.� Unlike in some large cars, I didn�t detect any float over road undulations. It might not be tossable, but this minivan is well buttoned down.

The ride is also good over just about any surface, though it�s not quite up to that of a good luxury sedan. Every once in a while you�ll feel the rear end skitter a bit over some imperfection in the road. I suspect this is because the rear suspension must be tuned for a wide range of loads. The ride probably improves with more weight in the vehicle, especially since the one I drove had a ride leveling suspension.

The only difference between the two suspensions is that the Dodge I drove had larger, 17" wheels. The tires are the same width, just with shorter sidewalls. Frankly, since i did not drive the two vans back to back it was hard to tell a difference in how they rode and handled. I want to say the steering was a little more responsive in the Dodge and that the ride was a little harsher, especially on slightly bumpy pavement, but they're very close. As I've already said, the 17" tires do not make the Grand Caravan into a sports car. 

Their main function is to look good and, like the Autostick, give the ES street cred as a minivan men would like to drive. I'm not crazy about the wheels. They have overly thick spokes and a chrome finish. I always hate chrome-coated alloys. They look like hubcaps. Nevertheless, I can say that even if it drove much the same I felt less like I had somehow surrendered my manhood in the Dodge.

The new Grand Caravan seems quieter than any other minivan I�ve driven or ridden in. Road and wind noise are both notably low for a vehicle with so much interior volume. The engine, fairly loud though not unpleasant under heavy throttle, is also quiet while crusing. As with the ride, noise levels overall are just short of a decent luxury car. 

My largest reservations with this vehicle (other than my generic reservations that apply to all minivans) concern the quality of some interior materials. The interior may be stylish, and in many ways seems a half step up from the old one, but some of the materials in there could still use some help. The storage compartments in the third row are the most glaring example of this. The plastic lid on one side still had a lot of flashing attached. The hinge is the cheap integral plastic type; with repeated use the door will break off. The latch simply hooks onto a hole in the interior trim. All in all, I cannot think of a cheaper way they could execute this compartment except leaving the lid off altogether. I suspect this is because it�s in the third row and they figured no one�s going to look at anything thoroughly back there anyway.

As with the Town & Country, the Grand Caravan did not make me comfortable with the idea of trading my sports sedan for a minivan. Not even in ES form. It's a very nice vehicle, and it's as sporty as long wheelbase minivans get. But, as with the Chrysler, I didn�t expect to greatly enjoy driving it and it didn�t surprise me. On a positive note, I can�t say I hated driving it, either. 

Still, I hope my wife is the one who ends up with the minivan. Between these two, I'm sure she'd go with the more sophisticated look of the Town & Country. If I am forced, kicking and screaming, into a minivan, I'll have more trouble deciding. I liked the appearance of the Town & Country better, both inside and out. But the more overt sportiness of the Grand Caravan ES tells me that's the one I, a man, am supposed to want. I did feel a little less robbed of my manhood in it, right? Right? Uhhh...if I have to drive one of these, she'd better let me have a Miata, too.
