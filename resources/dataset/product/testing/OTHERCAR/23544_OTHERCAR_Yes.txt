            I purchased my Canon Powershot G3 in December of 2002. Since then (one year) I have taken over 10,000 pictures with it. The camera has never failed to give me excellent quality pictures every time.

When I purchased the camera it cost me $799.00 plus tax. Now days you can find them online for as little as $460.00. 

In addition to the camera you will want to purchase a memory card of at least 256MB. But I suggest a 512MB. With the 512MB I can take about 250 highest resolution pictures.

Here are a few reasons why the Canon G3 is the best. The LCD can rotate out and in any direction. This way you can get some really interesting pictures that you would otherwise miss. The other big factor is battery life. With over 4.5 hours you will never have to worry about the battery being flat. When I get home I simply plug in the cable into the camera and the battery charges up without any fuss.

The Canon G3 is very simple to use. I like to use the Auto setting whenever the object I'm taking is not moving. If outdoors, I like to press the shutter button half way down while pointing at the blue sky. This assures a sky will be properly exposed. While holding the button down half way I point the camera onto my subject and take a picture pressing the button down the rest of the way.

Another really cool feature is the panoramic feature. In this mode the first picture sets the exposure for the next few pictures of the panoramic group. The LCD also display the previous picture to help align the next picture. Once home I use the supplied PhotoStitch software to stitch together a series of pictures for a panoramic. The panoramic picture that is produced is amazing.

If your thinking of purchasing a digital camera, be sure to get a Canon. They produce the best cameras on the market. The G3 has a big lens and takes pictures worth keeping. Don't make the mistake of purchasing a camera with a smaller lens, the picture quality will be disappointing.

The Canon Powershot G3 is one of the best digital cameras available today.
