            This camera is so easy to use, FUN and relatively inexpensive to shoot pictures, that the
entire family likes to use it all the time. The ergonomics are excellent. There are several
picture effects - B&amp;W, Solorized, Sepia and Negative Art. There are 7 picture modes
including a accurate spot light-metering mode. As you can tell this camera gives you a
good base for a medium-range digital camera. So if you are into sending pictures via
E-mail or setting up web pages this FD88 will fulfill your needs as it does mine. This camera is recommended by EXPERTS!!!!!!!!!!!!, and i would recommend this product to anybody, because it is sooooooo easy to use.<br><br>
