            I was a devote Eos 1V user and quite content using film. Then I had the opportunity to use a D30 for a day. Within 24 hours I had purchased my own and I have not looked back since. The D30 has a solid feel which is better if you add the battery grip option. The extra grip makes this unit look and feel like a pro slr. The output is great and high definition. If you are not shooting digital you don't know what your missing. The ability to shoot and review and either keep or discard shots makes you a better photographer faster. The downside to this camera comes in fast action performance and low light performance. The flash assist lamp can be annoying and the film speed is limited to short bursts due to the need of the camera to write to the flash card. Low light is significantly improved when an external speedlight is used. The built-in flash works well for closeup medium light application. It has a tendency to cast shadows when used with lenses with hoods attached. 
If you purchase or are consider purchasing this body figure on a few hundred $$ more for a decent microdrive or large flash card. Either works well and allows up to 800 exposures per session (1GB microdrive). Also plan on a speedlight for any flash usuage. 

Plan to spend some time on getting the hang of the adobe photoshop software. The camera is fairly intuitive but the software comes with scant manual information. A great digital camera and a no brainer if you have already invested in eos lenses.
