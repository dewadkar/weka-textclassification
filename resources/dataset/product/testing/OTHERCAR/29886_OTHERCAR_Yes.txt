            I had always appreciated the lines of Jaguar.  They are one of the most unique looking cars.  When a mercedes passes you (especially the new ones) you have to study it to tell what type of car it was - BMW?  Toyota?, etc.  Not so with a Jag.  (Although the rear of the new S-types does create the same problem). (Don't get me wrong, I like Mercedes also - very well made cars.  We have one.  But its not a Jag)

I always told myself that when I could afford it, I would get a Jaguar.  Well, a few years ago I got the opportunity.  We went looking at cars and found a great deal on a 2 year old lease return XJ6 (I believe buying a new car is like flushing 60% of the car's price down the toilet due to the first 2 years' depreciation). My wife always preferred BMW's, but I wanted a Jag. We had it narrowed down to a 5 series Beemer or a XJ6.  For once in the history of our marriage - I won! Just kidding honey...put down that frying pan...honey?..BONK!!!...............................now where was I?  Oh yeah, my wife had convinced me of the wisdom in purchasing a Jag.  Thank goodness for her powers of persuasion and insight!

Anyway, the one thing which worried both of us was the Jag maintenance reputation. Well, its kind of hard to believe, but Ford has fixed that.  When Ford purchased Jag in the early 90's, Jag had a tremendous number of problems per car coming off the line.  Ford basically said &quot;We don't want to touch the Jag mystique or appearance - but here's a bunch of money to fix the problems).  Now, Jag has a tremendous record for low problems per car.  

Our Jag is black with a tan interior.  Being a parent, I like that the rear seat has child restraint clamp fixtures behind them.  The Jag has great power and the handling is fantastic.  Like the classic Jag, it has the wood accents in the cabin.  I really like the seat memory (allows two people to program their seat and mirror positions so that when drivers switch back and forth, its just a push of a button instead of repositioning everything).  I would prefer if it had a glove compartment as internal storage is a bit thin (pockets behind the two front seats).  My wife loves the lumbar support.

The center counsel has a cup holder which retracts - however if you lean across the front seats (like unlocking the passenger door, etc.) you place your weight right on this.  Ours snapped once (and it is not cheap to replace the spring).  The stereo system is adequate, with an in-trunk CD changer.  Plus I like the expressions when people hear my music coming from a Jag (see my review of the All Time Best 10 Punk Rock Albums).

The leather interior holds up very well.  We have a 2 year old and it is hard to notice (he eats, drinks and rides around in the Jag all the time -we feel it is the safest car we own).  I like the child locks for windows and doors also.

There is plenty of room in front and the passenger section has plenty of head room. The trunk space is large and it is fairly easy to remove the spare tire if you need to change a flat tire.  

OK, so how about problems?  Well, our anti-lock warning light has come on 3 times now.  Each time, a trip to the dealer to learn that there is no problem.  The air conditioning went out once - but only due to a loose hose.  The floor mats in the front section come loose and slip forward.  The electric rear-view mirror went out once (no glare reduction).

That's about it.  I really enjoy owning this car.  Like any luxury car that has lots of bells and whistles, the more you have the more that can go wrong.  But as far as engine, electrical and cooling - we have not had any problems (except the loose hose mentioned above).

Jag's warranty is very comprehensive.  However, once you get into the extended coverage it lags a bit.  Our extended coverage just ended and except for powertrain stuff, I probably won't take it to the dealer due to high charges.
