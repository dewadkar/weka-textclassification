            After having driven a 95 and getting a ride in a '00 eclipse, I have been able to form some opinions on this sports car.  I have always been fond of driving small and agile cars.  In fact, I can never take out a Lincoln and actually enjoy driving it.  I like feeling glued to the road, and hearing the rumble of a loud exhaust tone as well as the power waiting to be unleashed under my right foot.  Unfortunately, Eclipse had never been able to provide any of these sensations.  I have test driven a friend's 95 turbo on more then one occasion.  The front seats were highly uncomfortable, and no matter how I floored the pedal, the 4cyl engine just couldn't give me the performance that I would get from a small block V8 -- despite the turbo.  Getting in and out of the car was a whole different story to begin with.  All in all, the anticipation that the Eclipse gave with its looks and style was nothing but a major disappointment the moment I became the wheelman.  To add insult to the injury, the car sported a 185MPH speedometer as if part of a major prank.

These were my feelings for the Eclipse until they came up with a completely redesigned 2000 model.  The side skirts seem like a major copycat of the new pontiac grand am, but the car seems to have beef to offer.  The V6 claimed to punch around 200+ HP, without a turbo!  This is indeed a major design change.  Although I was unable to drive the new Eclipse, I had the pluck to enjoy a ride at the passenger seat.  I can tell you they have improved much.  The front seats are much better then the earlier models, and in fact I don't have to spend minutes contemplating before I try to get inside the vehicle.  Back seats, even though my friend told me are bigger then usual, are still for little kids and dwarves, but who buys a sports car for the back seats anyway?  The ride is much smoother, and you can definitely hear the powerful engine grumble.  

Eclipse has improved much, but if you are into performance like I am, I would definitely say check out the market before buying one.  While at the same price range, the new Mustang GT offers 260hp horsepower from its massive V8.  Both GM F-bodies (Camarro z28, and Firebird Formula) will top any car within their price range.  Its quite pathetic comparing both Ford's 4.6liter and GM'5.7liter against the new 3.0 Eclipse.  While still playing catch up with american sports cars, Mitsubishi has improved much, and thus I will give it 3 stars, and hope that they keep the enchancements coming.<br><br>
