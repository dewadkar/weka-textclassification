            Overall, I must give this camera a nice round of applause. *clap* clap *clap*  The 2,000,000+ pixel resolution of the C-2000Z is incredible.  This sharpness is further increased by the 2.5x zoom and the gigantic lense on the front of the camera that aids brightness by incredible amounts.

Also, there is video-out, external flash, the charger is included, and the camera itself is pretty and sleek in design.  Unfortuately, the LCD preview display is only 1.8 inch so its kind of hard to see the image in any other way than a general idea of the picture.

Also, the use of SmartMedia memory is kind of annoying at times and does cause a slight minus on my scorecard for this baby.

Overall, I love this camera and, if you have the dough to dish out for this thing, I absolutely urge you to do so.<br><br>
