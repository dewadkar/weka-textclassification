            I owned a 1991 Eagle Talon 5sp for 3 years.  I bought the car with 47,000 miles on it.  It was in good condition.  The car handled great especially on tight turns.  The car also got great gas millage.  

I had virtually no problems with the car until around the third year of ownership. That's when I started my car up and the RPM's would surge up way high, and then drop down so low that it would kill the engine.  After having the vehicle towed to be serviced I was told that the car had recovered, but that eventually I would need to have a new body throttle put in it.  I was estimated $1,000 just for the part.  Then I began losing power when I turned on the air.  If I was at a light I had to shut the air off or it would kill the engine.  Small things then started happening, mostly cosmetic like stripping coming lose,  flip up lights needing to be fixed, and sticky roll down windows.   Then my gears started getting really stiff.  I took the car in to have the transmission looked at.  It was bad and needed to be replaced.  I could not find a transmission anywhere.  Then I got a call back from a guy who fixed cars.  He said that he could get a rebuilt transmission for $3,500, but there was no warranty or garauntee on it.  I opted to get rid of the car.

The vehicle in essence wasn't worth the amount we would have had to pay to fix it.  Parts for this vehicle, if you can even find them are outrageous.  Even wear and tear items like tires and brakes are going to cost you.  The main downfall of this car is that it is no longer in production and parts will become even harder to find as time goes on.
