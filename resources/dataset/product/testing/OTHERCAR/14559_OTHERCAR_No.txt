            I bought this camera because I just had my first son adn thought this would be the easiest way to get his new pictures out to relatives in a short period of time.  What I didn't take into effect is focusing.  This camera sucks for focusing and when you put it on your computer you totally need to render the photo to make it photo quality that will look good on your printer.  And even with rendering the pictures are usually still all blurry and tend to be too grainy.

Anyway here are my chief complaints:

1) The view finder screen makes focusing manually IMPOSSIBLE given the terrible resolution of the screen

2) In the dark you are completely screwed unless you have some sort of large light with which to light your subject...yes there is a flash but its no good unless your image is focused and YES the autofocus has no idea what to do with a dark subject.  The flash tends to make the pictures way too bright also.

3) The battery life is pathetic.  Each disk holds 40 pictures, the only problem is the battery usually doesn't last through all of them.

The good things about the mavica are:

1) the disc combatability...although I'm not quite sure why they don't go all out to the memory stick as sony keeps saying they want to do.

Overall I guess the newer Mavica's are better but they still rely on bad focusing technology which inevitably limits the Mavica's usefulness to the point of saying thanks but no thanks.
