            <b>Intro</b>

I disliked the S2000 when it came out!  There, said it.  Seriously, the looks didn&#146t do it for me, the nose is too flat and the fact that dealers were pricing way over MSRP just made the car totally uninteresting for me.  I mean I could snag a Mustang GT Convertible for around $28k, it has more power, practicality and a glass rear window.  

Added to that I sat in one at the LA auto show and was not at all impressed given the high belt line.

So why am I writing a review?  Cause in June 2003 I bought a used one is why!

Huh?  

Ok, I got knocked off my motorbike on the freeway, not my fault.  The insurance money took care of the rest of the bike balance and then some.  At which point my wife made her views on the subject very clear in that I had been damn lucky and better not push it anymore.  (This was my third time off a bike over the years) and to be honest, the bike scared me too a little.  These days they are just too fast and other road users just too self absorbed (LA drivers).  So for the moment I decided to hang up my helmet, and maybe get a cruiser a few years down the line.

So there I was in the enviable position to consider a second vehicle, so all the usual limitations such as practicality and every day usability went out the window.

<b>The Short List</b>

I settled on a price limit of $25k.  My only other specification was it had to be a convertible or T-Top.

I thought of an old Saab 900 turbo, but ruled it out because of the front wheel drive, looked into several 911's, considered a 944, bid on a Ferrari in E-Bay and flirted with an old Lotus Esprit.  Still nothing really grabbed me.  I just wanted something that would be low maintenance and easy to get parts for.  I finally narrowed it down to a late model Trans Am Firebird with WS6 package, the car I always wanted, and started shopping in earnest.  So how the heck did I get to the S2000?

Well I subscribe to a couple of auto magazines, and the little Honda was always popping up in comparison tests, and walking off with First place.   Hmm, maybe I should test drive one and I knew there was one sitting outside the local Honda dealer.  So off I went, I still wasn&#146t impressed by the looks, but then I drove it and magic happened.  Everything was the usual to me, high belt line, questionable styling in my eye&#146s and as the salesman took it off the lot, well it sounded nice but.  He drove it enthusiastically, even so after having a couple of V8&#146s to my name, from the passenger seat I wasn&#146t blown away.  Then we swapped, and everything just clicked and I was 90% sure this was a better choice than the Pontiac.

To be sure, the next day I asked my buddy at work if I could take his car for a spin (exact Firebird model that I was looking for) and it felt big, cumbersome and dated.  Ok, the Honda it is.

Initially I was looking for a 2002 so I could get the glass rear window, in reality it&#146s hard to find a good one that hasn&#146t been abused or modified in some way.  I finally found a year 2000 up in Malibu, Silverstone with Red interior, bone stock with car cover; it was love at first site.

<b>The Review</b>

Exterior, the cars looks have grown on me, though I still think it needs bigger wheels from an aesthetics point of view, evidently Honda agreed as they went from 16's to 17's on the 2004's.  When I snagged it the car had 47k on the clock, and the paint is in great shape.  Very few stone chips or mars at all, so there is something to be said for the finish Honda put on these cars.  You can get front and rear spoilers from Honda, mine has none but I think I may get the front lip as the nose gets a little light at high speeds, of course there are also a bunch of aftermarket solutions too, but the Honda unit comes in the right color and simply bolts on.

Interior, the seats are very snug, actually just perfect for me; I am 5'8", 168lbs.  Once in, the car fits me like a glove.  The accessory power socket is in the center console between the seat backs.  Huh?  Where am I going to plug my radar detector in?  No problem, a three socket extension did the trick, I ran the wire down by the passenger seat, and the extended socket lives just nicely in a net pocket on the transmission tunnel.  This arrangement actually turned out to be perfect as now I can plug in my MP3 player, cell phone AND radar detector at the same time, and not have any unsightly wires sprawling across the dash.

The carpet is cheap feeling, and again on later models Honda covered the center console with leather instead.  But again there are plenty of aftermarket places that have covers you can buy.  There are no frills in this car; it's basic, though you do get the remote radio controls at your fingertips.  However there is no clock, not even on the radio.

As others have noted, there is a lack of storage space, but I am not sure if I agree.  Sure there is no glove box, but there is plenty of storage in the storage bins between the seats.  Storing CD's was a problem until I discovered that you can get one of those case logic things and it fits nicely tucked under the passenger seat.  But that became academic when I got my I-pod, since I don't carry CD's anymore.  It's a two seater, how much storage do you expect?

The radio is terrible!  Yes the sound comes out of just two door speakers, and is very boomy, the head unit itself is nothing special and in fact mine skips when playing cd&#146s so at some point I will have to change it anyway.  There is a simple upgrade to add speakers behind the seats, and the stock radio does have rear speaker connections.  To put this in perspective, I am usually happy with any radio as long as sound comes out, I get used to it.  I have never gotten used to the S's sound quality.

On the I-Pod front there is nothing but good news.  I have an I-trip fm modulator and it plays over my radio flawlessly.  Considering I can't play my CD's, this is a godsend.  

That just about covers it for the interior descriptive bit, oh yeah the trunk is small, but plenty big enough to fit a weekend bag or a weeks worth of groceries.

The inside transforms (in my eye's anyway) once you let the clutch out and start driving.  Personally I love the digital instrumentation.  The car redlines so high that the bright orange RPM bar is perfect for keeping in your peripheral vision as you wind it up through the gears, and line of the hood; oh this is so hard to describe, it's invisible from the outside, but the hood is actually lower than the fenders, you have this line running down and forward, from the driving seat it smacks of the classic roadsters of old, this feeling is enhanced when you drive with the roof up, it's a single layer and does nothing more than keep the weather out, for some reason the car just feels special when you drive it, once the keys turns the motor off, the magic disappears, but every time I hit that start button and pull out of the driveway, it's back, and it's addictive.

<b>The Driving Thrill</b>

A stop light racer is not this cars specialty, though it will do it.  Due to the low torque it's not the easiest car to launch well, but once you do and hit that 6000rpm vtec threshold, the exhaust note transforms into an angry banshee wail, and all of a sudden it doesn't seem to matter that the other car is a nose or two ahead, the little Honda is whispering to your soul that the real driving is done in the curves and there's one coming up, and gone as your competition slides into your rearview mirror.

Seriously, I spent a day driving in the mountains with some people who know the road very well.  Initially I couldn't keep up with them as I just wasn't comfortable.  Later in the day I was running with the pack and I never hit the cars limit, we are talking about exiting 15 miles per hour hairpins at 45+ with no sign of the back end breaking loose, uncanny!  The car is a precision tool for the twisties, those who say there is not enough power just don't get it.

Ok so you don't have to drive it every day Ashley, but could you?  This is a tough call, I spent two weeks driving the S2000 daily to work and back because a visiting friend was borrowing my Trooper.  The clutch is light enough for traffic, and the car will lope along in 6th gear on the freeway with no trouble, but at the end of two weeks I was ready to get back in the trusty SUV.  I think it's because you can't be lazy in this car, it's highly strung and wants you to grab it by the scruff of the neck and drive it hard.  The suspension communicates every bit of the road to you and the slightest twitch of the steering wheel is answered immediately, not to mention the noise, which is worse with the roof up (but then I never do put it up unless it rains).  At the end of a long work day, sometimes you want to just sit back and let the car drive you home, and the Honda won't.  Personally I wouldn't buy this as my only car and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else in that mode either, the noise alone makes this a car I wouldn't want to spend a long journey in, any decent sized cup in the cup holder makes changing gear an awkward event and conversation with your passenger can turn into a yelling match.
