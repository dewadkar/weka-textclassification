            This car is great.  I currently own a 1997 Red Hyundai Tiburon, and I enjoy it very much.  It has a sports car feel, but an interior that rocks with space and comfort.  Since owning the car, I have added to it by customizing it to my tastes.  I have added cruise control, a moon-roof, fender flares, chrome wheels, and a front end cover.  Even without the customizations, I think it is an excellent car to drive.  I bought this vehicle after much shopping and comparing similar cars like the Celica, the Eclipse, and Cougar.  I chose the Tiburon because it had similar if not the same features as the other cars, but was a lot more affordable.  In fact, when buying this vehicle, I searched the entire Northwest US for it and didn't mind driving 300 miles to the Seattle area to get it, because it the Tiburon was exactly what I wanted.  I can't wait for them to come out with the convertible version, which is currently a concept car.  I will definitely buy another Tiburon in the future!!  <br><br>
