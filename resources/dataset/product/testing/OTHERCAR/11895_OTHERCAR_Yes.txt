            I received this camera as part of a workshop incentive for teachers.  We literally learned how to use it in 10 minutes.  Within 10 minutes, we had taken pictures, reviewed the miniature gallery, loaded pictures on laptops, and learned how to delete old pictures.  I was instantly pleased!  
The following weekend it went on it's first trip to the Everglades, where I dropped it, PANICKED, and thanked you know who when it still worked.  Throughout the four hour excursion, I did manage to use up the 4AA batteries it takes, but I was reviewing and deleting quite often.  Normally the camera shuts off the viewing screen after 1 minute of inactivity.
The software is very easy to work, but it is slightly inconvenient to plug into the computer each time you want to download your pix.  More expensive models allow you to use a regular floppy disk eliminating this step, but for the price you can't beat the quality.  The only problem I seem to be having is replacing batteries, but I will be looking into rechargeables to try and alleviate this expense.  
I have had a blast with this camera and can't wait to use it again next week when my fourth graders go to Sea World.....hopefully I won't need to find out if it is water proof.   ;0)<br><br>
