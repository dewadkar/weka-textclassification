                 I bought a new Buick Century Limited last summer and absolutely love this car. It is perfectly quiet and has acceptable power. I decided to order the leather seats which moved me into the Limited instead of the Custom which I originally planned to buy. I researched the purchase price of the car and compared it with several others such as the Accord and Camry and even the Sable. 
     What I found out is that the Century has a tremendous number of standard features. And many of the standard features, including many safety features such as ABS, traction control, front seat air bags and low tire pressure indicator and remote locking doors, are either an extra cost on the Camry and Accord or are not even available. Plus the Century comes standard with a V-6 engine and automatic and even air conditioning. I think I got a very good value with my new Century and plan to keep it for several years. It has a very nice design and is pleasing. My neighbor now wants to buy a 2001 Century when they come out. 
     This is a car really well designed for families. It has a very large trunk for example and the rear seat features a pass through so I can carry longer items. I frequently go the Home Depot and find myself buying plumbing supplies and lumber and it all fits in the trunk with the rear seat folded down. I also have been able to compromise with my wife on the temperature in the front seat. I like to keep the temp low and she is very small and doesn't feel comfortable when I get the A/C turned down. The Century allows us both to control our individual temperatures separately. What a great idea!
     Who shouldn't buy this car? Well, if you are looking for something &quot;edgy&quot; that will generate alot of attention cruising up and down the boulevard you can forget the Century. It is an attractive car but it certainly isn't a standout and that is fine with me. Also, since there is only one suspension available in the Century and it is fairly soft, you should avoid this car if you want an aggressive ride. I'm not an old guy. I'm 42 with a wife and two kids ages 6 and 11. 
     We love the Buick. And I know when it comes time to sell this car that I will get a good trade in for it. Heck, my neighbor wants to buy it now. I ordered it in the light blue which is a very nice color but my neighbor has informed me that Buick no longer offers it for some unknown reason. Too bad. I've got about 8,500 miles on it now and we're getting ready to take it on our vacation to DisneyWorld in Orlando. It rides well enough and there is plenty of room that I'm not worried about going 1200 miles with my family in this car. Consider that our other vehicle is a Ford Windstar which my wife drives and has been having reliability problems and will soon be traded in for a new Chevy Venture van.      
     I have not been blindly buying Buicks all my life. This is actually only my second Buick and I loved the first one also. I research my buying decisions and it usually takes me six months before I make a major purchase such as a car. <br><br>
