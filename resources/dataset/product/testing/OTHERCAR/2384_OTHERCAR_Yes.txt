            I'm a filmmaker by trade, and a passionate photographer in my off hours.  I love the look of film, and have a not-so-secret skepticism about the quality of digital imagery.  Nonetheless I also love my computer, so I was finding it hard to resist the notion of a direct link between camera and computer.

I was musing about this to a friend about a week before my vacation.  &quot;Why not borrow my Toshiba PDR-M5?&quot; he suggested innocently enough.  Who could resist?

What a camera!  It's really easy-to-use-- there's virtually no learning curve.  The 3x optical zoom offers good flexibility, with colors that are sharp and clear.  The battery lasted for miles and miles of bicycle paths and cobblestone streets.  Best of all, the &quot;Image Expert&quot; software is very smart.  Its &quot;quick fix&quot; button adjusted contrast and color with amazing accuracy.  Sure, I went in and fiddled with the individual controls too, but I ended up very close to their original efforts.

Printing was also straightforward. With a couple of sample pieces of photo paper, my Epson was soon printing out reasonable 8x10 glossy prints.

The cons?  Well, I would have loved to bring it to the beach, but sand is strongly warned against.  For a &quot;film snob&quot;, even at 2.1 megapixels the resolution still wasn't as good as the real thing, so I ended up lugging my trusty Nikon FM along as well.  And lastly, though I appreciated the macro option, I would have loved to have interchangeable lenses to really get some flexibility.  I believe the new top-of-the-line Nikon is the only camera to currently offer this.

At this price, though, I'd have to say the Toshiba PDR-M5 is a great value.  You'll get good-quality imagery, and it's a whole lot of fun.  <br><br>
