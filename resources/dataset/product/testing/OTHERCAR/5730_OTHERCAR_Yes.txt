            When I obtained my driver's license, my dad gave me his 1992 Plymouth Acclaim.  I was very happy at the moment, and had many great times with the car.

It was great on gas.  A full tank (not sure how much gas it held, but usual amount I put in at a fill-up was 52.5 litres) could get me 525 kilometres in the summer, but only 400-450 in the winter.

Another great thing was it was easy to modify.  I had two CD decks in it as well as the factory deck, and was amazed at how little time it took to install them.

I was also surprised at how easy it was to be broken into when I came to the car to go to work one morning and found that my CD player was gone.  It was very visible that somebody had just used a coat hanger to get in, and wanted nothing more than the player and manual.

One problem it had throughout the entire time my family owned it (my dad purchased it in 1993 and sold it in 2003) was the fact that it guzzled up the oil.  It leaked it everywhere, and no matter what we did, no mechanic (not even the ones at the dealership) could figure out how to stop it.  So it was a ritual to be forced to fill up the oil tank every week or two.

Another thing it liked to do beginning in the summer of 2001 was overheat a lot, or sometimes just fake the overheating.  I would be driving along, and the temperature guage would remain at the three quarter mark when every other vehicle I have ever driven usually remains somewhere just above or just below half.  Sometimes it would even get to the point where my 'check engine' light would come on and everything that could possibly flash on my dash would with the temperature guage showing that it was at it's maximum, and then the temperature would appear to suddenly go to the halfway mark.

The thing that caused us to give up this car was the fact that after 291570 kilometres, the transmission blew.  So instead of replacing that, we found it cheaper to put our 1986 Chrysler Fifth Avenue back on the road.  The car was sold this past summer, and I have seen it around the area a few times, noticing it because of the mark in the rear lights that my dad put there when he backed up into a fire hydrant.
