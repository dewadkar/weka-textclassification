            The first Toyota on my side of the family was when my dad purchased a new 1992 Toyota Camry. I fell in love with that car and was almost broken-hearted when he traded it in for a 1996 Toyota Land Cruiser (which by the way is an excellent vehicle too - if you can afford the gasoline).

My wife and I were about to have our first baby and I wanted to get a reliable vehicle to tote us all around in. At the time I could not afford a Camry, but I immediately fell in love with what I have dubbed the Mini-Camry. My wife saw it in the Certified Pre-Owned vehicle area of our local Toyota dealer. It was a 1996 Toyota Corolla DX with color matched everything, power everything, tinted windows, it was even the same color as my father's former Camry.

We have had this car for more than two years now, it's been in a minor fender bender (the damage was promptly repaired), but it is as solid as the first day we bought it. When this is paid for, we plan to get a Toyota mini-van to tote our now two kids around. Since it was a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle we still have nearly 25,000 miles left of the 100,000 mile power-train warranty.

We get about 24 miles/gallon (city) and the A/C is phenomenal in the Texas heat. The factory installed AM/FM Cassette/Stereo sounds wonderful, but I should have upgraded to the CD (oh well...we'll get that next time). We plan to keep this car as long as possible and we wouldn't dream of trading it in.

My only complaints about this car is that when driving at highway speeds through a strong head-wind the wind over the mirrors creates an annoying wind noise. Also, rear-facing child seats do not fit well in the back seat unless they are in the middle; since most car seats cannot fit side-by-side, this forces the passenger to pull their seat forward leaving slightly cramped leg room when you have to put two car-seats in the back.

This is an excellent family starter vehicle and an excellent introduction into the Toyota line of vehicles. It is as reliable as the sunrise and it is easy to maintain. I HIGHLY recommend this vehicle.<br><br>
