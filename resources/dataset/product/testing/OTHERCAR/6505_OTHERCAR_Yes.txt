            We bought this camera after returning the Olympus D510 that we got as a Christmas gift, only because the Olympus had too many features for a beginner and the Kodak camera dock was offered for only $50 Canadian more when you bought the Kodak DX 3600 camera. What a good decision that was. It is a great camera, it does everything we need it to do, and the Kodak software does the rest (black and white, sepia). I like the macro feature that lets me take close ups of my kids, and the 2.2 megapixel does a great job for printing and sharing photos or for using in my kids scrapbooks.It's also neat to have internal memory, that way you don't need to worry about cards at first, even though we bought a 16MG flash card a week later. I also like the self timer, it lets me get in the pictures once in awhile when the kids sit still long enough.The lens retracts and is covered, so it should be pretty durable, and the screen at the back is clear, and can be wiped off with your shirt because your nose may leave marks if you are using the viewfinder.  The video quality is neat, even though we have a camcorder, sometimes the kids are doing something cute, and we didn't bring the camcorder, this way you can still capture it on video with the digital camera. The quality isn't that great to show on TV though, and you have to be very quiet if you are close to the camera because the microphone picks up a lot. Another thing I found annoying is that it also has a very bright flash, which, thank goodness, is easy to turn off. I noticed after taking close ups of my kids during the day, that it can create some pretty wicked shadows, and my husband says it's blinding.(I wouldn't know because I'm usually on the other side of it). But is is easy to turn off, or choose red eye or fill flash. Colorful, and neat menu that even my grandma could use, it's very user friendly. It give you the option to delete a picture for 5 seconds after it is taken, which can be useful if you take lots of pictures to get the perfect shot like I do.
The dock was a great investment too, it recharges the batteries (included with the dock)and it makes transferring so easy, not that it is that difficult without it. The transfer software is great, simple to use, and give you the option to delete the memory once it is transferred to your computer.
