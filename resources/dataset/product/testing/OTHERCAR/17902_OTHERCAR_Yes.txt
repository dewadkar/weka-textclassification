            This was the first time that I changed from driving a car. I normally drove large cars, Lincoln's etc. Being divorced, my children wanted me to drive something that could get around no matter what. I liked the explorer but wanted something a bit different. I also wanted something other than black. I leased a white one. I love it. The kids have a blast in the back with their own radio and air conditioning controls, I no longer fear for my life when the weather reports snow or ice. The ride is steady, I'm up higher then the average person and gives me a good picture of what is going on at all times. Lincoln Mercury dealer (Wayne Lincoln Mercury) have been very responsive on minor issues that all new cars have. 
This vehicle has so many possible uses, it's unbelievable. You have plenty of space to haul stuff, its comfortable, it has the top of the line package for 98 (660). The truck has not changed a bit in 3 model years so my 98 looks like a 2000. Snow or ice is no problem any longer. The only concern left is the other guy not me. Its got a V8 so there is plenty of power.<br><br>
