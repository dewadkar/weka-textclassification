            The one reason you'd probably grab this camera over it's siblings would be it's small size. You'd be hard pressed to find so many features packed into a tiny package you can carry everywhere. But, if that compact size doesn't matter to you, grab a more "SLR-like" camera.

And c'mon Sony! For this price, you could at least include a carrying case. A memory stick larger than 8MB should be included at this price point as well.

The unit seems to snap the picture a little slowly for a camera in this price range. It can take from 1 to 4 seconds to get a shot off.That can get annoying when your subject may be moving around.

Also, when holding the camera, it's very easy to let your left hand cover the lens.
