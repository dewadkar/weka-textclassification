            I've always been endeared of the Pathfinders since they came out with the old 2 door models.  I've also liked the 4Runners alot also (maybe more than the Pathys), but Toyota dealers were charging a premium on them back then.  I decided on a new 97 2WD XE.  I have not been disappointed with my decision.  The truck looks great and drives just as well.  Nissan reliability on the Pathfinder was surprisingly good.  Other than regular oil changes and checkups, no problems with it at all, except for some disc brake squealing which was fixed under warranty.  Everything about the truck is great.  It handles very well, no worry of possible roll-over and the ride is not as bouncy as some of the other SUV's.  I was also surprised at the rather tight turning radius for the truck.  BUT, the biggest drawback about these is the pathetic engine power.  It is adequate, but no where near what it should be.  I'd have to floor it just to keep up to speed going up some hills.  Other little nagging things are tire wear and why don't I have a freaking clock?  I will be considering getting one of the new Pathfinders with 240HP or getting the new 4Runners w/ the upgraded engine coming soon.  But if you are in the market for a used SUV, then this will not disappoint.
