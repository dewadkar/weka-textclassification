            I just got this little camera a few weeks ago and am I ever pleased.  It takes great pictures and is very simple to use.  

This is my first digital camera and I did quite a bit of research before actually buying.  My requirements were ease of use, quality pictures, optical zoom, USB compatibility, standard battery acceptance and, of course, a low price.  This camera fit perfectly.  

With a maximum resolution of 1280 X 960 quality prints can be made up to a size of 5 X 7. For prints any larger you'd want a camera with higher resolution, thus a higher price tag.  For me, this is fine.  I rarely have prints made larger than 4 X 6 anyway.  

The USB compatibility means the upload to the computer is very quick - a 16 mg card takes only a few seconds on my machine. 

You can use standard AA alkaline batteries or NIMH rechargeables.  I would highly recommend the rechargeables as digital cameras eat batteries very quickly and this one is no exception.

My favorite little feature has to be the lens cover.  Instead of a plastic cap that either dangles from a string or comes completely off (and gets set down somewhere to be forgotten) the cover on this camera is a metal face plate that slides over to the side. Very slick!

I really hate fooling with settings and buttons, etc. to take a picture.  On this camera there is no need.  Set it to automatic, point and shoot.  Very simple.  I took my first pictures before ever opening the manual.  For those that like fiddling with such things it also allows some manual settings.  The pictures are very sharp and have great color.  With flash pictures you can expect good results up to about 6 to 10 feet with normal indoor lighting. At least that has been my experience so far.  The 3X optical zoom is really nice to have.  Fuji has a model without it for about $50 less but I think the extra money is well worth it.  It's just so much easier to frame a good shot with a zoom lens.  The LCD screen is small but very clear.  Pictures can be viewed one at a time or several at once. 

If I had to find a fault with this little gem I guess it would be the flash/red-eye.  Seems like I get more of this than with a regular film camera.  I had read that this can be a problem for a lot of digital cameras though so I wasn't really surprised.  Since I like to run my pictures through an editing program for cropping and fine-tuning it's not a big deal.  Most photo editing programs can do a decent job of fixing it.

The software that comes with the camera includes a viewer program and Adobe Photodeluxe, a good basic editing program.  I don't use the viewer - I just copy the files directly to a folder and go from there.  The camera also comes with 4 regular AA batteries and a 4mg smartmedia card which will hold from 4 to 20 or so pictures depending on the settings you use.  Enough to get you started.  You'll likely want a larger smartmedia card or two and you'll definitely be needing more batteries.  

This camera has many features of more expensive models without the higher price tag.  There are plenty of better cameras available for more money and also lots of &quot;not as good&quot; ones for less but, for my money and needs, I chose this one and I'm really happy with it.
