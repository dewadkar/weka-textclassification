            I have been driving my Lincoln Town Car for about a year and have placed over one hundred thousand miles this year alone. I have a lower back problem and this car has helped me in numerous ways to relieve the pain of driving.
This car is the only car I have been able to ride in for more than an hour without having any discomfort. The digital components make it a plus as you move from day light into the night.
