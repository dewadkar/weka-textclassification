            The New Dodge Intrepid is a great family car. Coming from a family with three children it definately provides the qualities I anticipated. I love the fact that you have a deep truck, providing space for not only groceries, but sports equipment as well on top of it. It gets really good gas mileage both in city and interstate. It provides you with a smooth ride with the minimum of noise. However, there is still some outside noise detected. You can comfortably fit three adults in the back seat with plenty of head and leg room. Which is an absolute must. It has a quick response time in taking corners and avoiding obstacles with the turn of the wheel. I think anyone who is looking for comfort, affordability, and good gas mileage should look at this vehicle.  <br><br>
