            Back in college I bought an eleven year old Mercedes-Benz 220 Diesel with well over 150,000 miles on it. I drove it for another 50,000 miles before selling it at a profit. Never had a problem and I became a firm believer in Mercedes' legendary quality.

10 years later I was very excited to hear about Mercedes' SUV. I joined their mailing list right after they showed their first prototypes, and even though the final production model fell short of expectations (the prototype looked very cool!), I decided to go ahead and get one in late '99.

The initial impression was great. The engine was so quiet, in idle you couldn't tell if it was even running. The handling was great, very car like. The seats were quite comfortable. I loved the look -- well, the front anyway. 

During the 4-year lease, however, I became more and more disappointed in this car. The engine that is so quiet in idle gets pretty loud and uncivilized during passing maneuvers. I had to bring it back in for plenty of recalls and annoying little repairs. I found the dealers quite snobby, very much into the legendary reputation of their product even though mine didn't live up to that reputation. It often felt like I was doing something wrong to their "baby". I actually got hung up on by Mercedes corporate once, so much for customer service. 

While we still enjoyed driving the car toward the end of our lease, we decided to not buy it out when just before the warranty expired the transfer case had to be replaced. This was a $2,700 repair, and with the history we have had we were too afraid something else would break after the warranty was over. Furthermore because of the quality problems, resale value for the M-Class is uncharacteristically low, our residual was several thousands higher that what these were selling for at the time. So while we didn't hate the car, we also didn't love it enough to take the risk of owning it past the factory warranty. And for a Mercedes, that is a devastating statement.
