              Looking for a new car I decided to test drive this car.  For a change of pace from honda, toyotas I decided to try out a nissan for once.  Every year nissan has a good quality car or a not so great model to pick, it's random from year to year. I test drove it a couple of times and it felt comfortable, getting around to places it was sufficient and handling was good.  For the other passengers theres enough room for them to fit and get in and out.  Like every car, if you don't maintain it of course it will breakdown.  Overall engine performs well, suspension, handling and breaking are in good shape and allows a smooth trip to your routine points of intrest.
