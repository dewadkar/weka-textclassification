            Purchased in Oct. 2000 with 53K miles and I've put 57K on it since. Its been rock solid dependable, never stranding me. Its fantastic in the wet or snow, you simply put it in gear and go. Good balance to the handling, even with the soft L suspension. Wheel & Tire upgrade to 16X7s and 205/55/16 tires has made a dramatic improvement in overall grip.

Ride is very good, albeit with a fair amount of road noise.

I drive hard and the little 2.2 keeps thrumming along, burning barely no oil at all, especially good for 110K miles. Mileage is around 25 city, 30 highway.

The dealers are inconsistent, price-wise and quality of work wise. Prices for the 60K service varied by several hundred dollars from dealer to dealer. One dealer replaced the timing belt at the required 60K miles, and swore that the main shaft seal and cam seals never leak and didn't need to be replaced. 500 miles later, all of the above seals started leaking, meaning the whole d**n mess had to be torn down again and put right at significant cost. Another dealer replaced the clutch which promptly shuddered like a dog in the cold straight out of the dealership. They told me that "Its a Subaru Characteristic" and they could only replace it if a defect is found. In their defense, the found and replaced a few leaking oil seals. 

Moral of the story, find a good Subaru specialist.

The clutch cable buzzes and so does the cup holder, but otherwise this car is totally solid and kicks behind. It will be replaced by a 2002 L Wagon Automatic soon. 

This would be an awesome 1st car for a teenager.
