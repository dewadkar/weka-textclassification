                   I bought the Kia Sephia because I was in desperate need of transportation to allow me to make it to work and back home.What I love about the Kia Sephia is its' price. I find the cars that Kia make are very reasonable. What I hate about the Kia Sephia is its interior inside of the vehicles. It seemed to me that everything I touched would simply fall apart as if it was legos or something. Driving the vehicle felt like driving a bucket, but only a new bucket. The drives were very bumpy and rough.Kia reminds me of the Geo. Very cheap interior wise, and under the hood. I'm not saying that the car is not worth the price because the car is good for teenagers and young adults. The  car does provide transportation at a reasonable price.I do not recommend that Baby Boomers and senior citizens buy this car.   <br><br>
