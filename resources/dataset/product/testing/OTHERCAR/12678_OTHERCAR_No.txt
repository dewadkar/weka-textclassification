            Buy American? Sure, if things were the way they should be, but they're not. It wasn't so much the fact that my transmission failed shortly after the 3 year warranty expired, rather, it was the way in which Chevrolet Motor Division Headquarters (Customer Service?) handled the situation--they really haven't got a clue or even seem to care just who their customers are.  

No wonder there are so many frivolous lawsuits nowadays--because statistically (profit wise--but not in the long run...), big companies, like GM, must figure that it's better to "stick it" to customers, and let them sue for what they should've gotten in the first place, than to simply reimburse the poor customer the $884.00 it cost to replace his transmission, which failed due to manufacturer DEFECT.

Sure, they could've simply appologized for the inconvenience, and taken care of the problem, thus keeping that customer satisfied enough that he or she may decide to be loyal, and buy 6 or 7 more cars from them during his or her lifetime, and maybe even refer a few friends to do the same. But no!

Actually, the dealership was pretty fair about it. They even agreed that a transmission shouldn't go bad like that with only 39,000 miles on it. That being the case, I did get a transmission free on a partial goodwill--but they said I had to pay the $884.00 labor out of my own pocket because it was no longer covered under warranty. They suggested I contact Chevrolet and maybe they would help me with this, since it was rather unusual for this type of situation to occur.

I contacted Chevrolet and got a claim number (at least I was able to get that much). But they say "sorry". But being that it should've never happened in the first place, I expect Chevrolet to reimburse me for those labor charges and I'm pretty fired up. So now I'm planning to name them in a suit to get my money back. I know, it's silly isn't it? I should just be happy and go on about my business and get used to being swindled by big businesses. But I'm not gonna do that! This kind of BS makes me mad! And I don't care if I get the money or not now, as long as this becomes a matter of public record, so perhaps, others can be better prepared and know what they might expect from CHEVROLET, should anything like this ever happen to them after buying a new vehicle.

Anyway, they said "Sorry" (meaning "f___ you"). "You should've purchased an extended warranty", which is like saying; "Hey. You really shouldn't have bought this piece of junk in the first place, because we're not confident enough in our engineering and workmanship to offer any better than a three year/36,000 mile warranty. Besides, if we did that, we might not make enough profit from selling all these extended warranties, which, statistically, help keep us wealthy!"

Plus, I think they're on to something, these big corporations, namely CHEVROLET. They know how stupid their customers are. They buy a car with only a three year/36,000 warranty because it's a "Chevy" "THE HEARTBEAT OF AMERICA" or "LIKE A ROCK" or something.... I thought that buying a Chevy meant I shouldn't need an extended warrany because I thought Chevys are buit to last.   Boy was I wrong!

But here is what I find rather interesting. Over time, we, Americans, seemed to have lost something along the way in our genuine concern for customer satisfaction and professionalism.

I'm only 40, but I recall not to long ago that when something wasn't right, or if you had a complaint about something and told somebody, the problem usually got professionally and favorably resolved. Now, it seems, when a problem or incident occurs, you have to be put on hold, redirected, and talk to seven or eight "clueless" idiots before you even get a response, which, in turn, is usually another clueless, idiotic, unfavorable response--these people ought to save alot of time and effort being so uncaring and "clueless"--they ought to put a tape recording on there that says "if you are unhappy with a product or service, then "screw you".

But the Japanese and Korean manufactures know what customer service is about and they sell cars with better warranties, and even though statistically, they may be required to pay for the "norm" manufacturer defects which may occur down the road, they know that if customers are treated curteously, and taken care of, then they are more likely to give them more return business.

See what you get for being patriotic? I could've bought a Japanese car, but I spent three years in the Marine Corps and I'm a proud American! So I thought it was a good idea to buy american ("good for the economy"), but I don't anymore. When I paid $15,000.00 for my 1997 Chevy Cavalier, I never though I'd need a new transmission just after my 3 year warranty expired, but I did. But it's a Chevy! I didn't think Chevy made junk, or if they did, I thought they were a reputable AMERICAN Company that took pride in curteous, professional customer service--but they don't!!! So buyer beware!!!
