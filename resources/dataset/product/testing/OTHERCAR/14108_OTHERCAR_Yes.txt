            Let me first say that I have been either a Ford or Dodge truck owner/user most my life.  Several months ago I began my search for a new truck, looking at Ford and Chevy.  Dodge was no longer an option for me.  More on that later.  I was looking for V8, 4x4, and the ability to haul heavy payloads and 4 adults.

I started at the local Ford dealership.  Drove the F-150 over an entire weekend.  Just didn't like the feel and ride.  Dealer suggested the F-250 with diesel motor.  The ride and power was better, but the cab noise from the motor was too loud.  I headed over to the Chevy dealer the following weekend.  I was given a 1500 to test drive for the day.  The ride was softer and better, and I liked the power slightly over that of the Ford F-150.  But I didn't like the cab layout or instruments, nor did I like the fact that the motor shuts off when you reach 100 mph, kicks back on after he speed drops  (Don't ask why I need a truck to do 100mph).  I was not sold on either truck, both retailing around $32 - $35k depending on options and rebates.

I then saw a report while surfing the Internet on the Toyota Tundra.  I thought this was another lame attempt on Toyota's part to get into the truck market half heartedly (T-100 was a joke in the truck world).  After reading the reports by Off Road and 4x4 Mag, I thought it was worth my time to at-least entertain the Tundra as a possible candidate, although I did have to wrestle with the thought of buying Japanese for the first time.

From the moment I test drove the Tundra SR5, 4x4, V8, Access Cab, I was totally amazed!  The truck had awesome power, smooth ride (car like), hauled a ton, and the cab was very quiet.  It is the best truck on the 2002 market!  I promise you.  I have spent 3 months researching, and even though I did not drive the 2002 Dodge, I can tell you that the Tundra is the best truck out there.

How can I say that without driving the Dodge Ram, simple, I have owned them in the past, as recent as the 1999 model.  The engines in the Dodge are the only thing that last.  Electrical and the transmission always seem to go out around 60K.  I have had to replace alternators, ignitions, & transmissions in 3 of the 5 Dodge vehicles I have owned over the years.  And for "wear and tear" parts, clutches and brakes wear out much faster than on the Ford trucks.

At the end, I bought the Toyota Tundra SR5, V8, 4x4, and Access Cab.  I added limited slip dif, TRD off road package, heavy duty starter, battery, & heater, CD, class IV hitch, and keyless entry.  All for 27,500 with freight included.  Taxes not included.  And guess what, the truck is built in Indiana.  Last time I checked, Indiana was still in the USA.  So I am sleeping better at night.

I love everything about this truck, and with a few minor changes that Toyota should consider for future models, Toyota will dominate the truck market just as the dominate the car market.  Toyota needs to fix/ add the following:  Back seat has to be fixed, too upright (fix found on www.tundrasolutions.com).  Like to see the side mirrors automatically tilt down when in reverse (Dodge Rams do that).  Like the alt pwr plugs to stay on after the truck is off (fix found again on tundra solutions), and finally, like to see the radio positioned better or controls on the steering wheel as well.  Currently, it is a long reach for the driver.

Other than that, the Toyota Tundra is the best truck on the market.  Ford, Chevy, and Dodge are running scared.
