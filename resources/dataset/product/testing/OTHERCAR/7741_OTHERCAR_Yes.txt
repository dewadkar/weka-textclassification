            I bought my '97 plymouth neon because i just recently totalled my old car. I was looking for a safe, reliable, and smaller car, but with enough room to pack my friends in, and after a lot of looking, i found the car. 

It drives nice and smooth, and is very quiet. Now that winter's come it's realy being tested and so far it's doing a good job. I've never had a problem starting my car even in the frigid temps, and the heater kicks in real fast. What else could you want? It handles well in the snow, but because it's so low to the ground it can get tricky. The gas mileage is excellent, too (34 miles to the gallon). It stops and it turns extremely well... which is great in whatever season.

The few things i don't like about the car is that the windows fog up fast and all the time. Being so low to the ground can bring up a few problems, especially when big vans who can't see you are backing up into you *grumble*. It also doesn't excellerate *fast* but it excellerates steady, even up hill, and you can get to those high speeds in a hurry.

I love my car. And i don't regret a single penny i payed for it. i would recomend it to students or people just starting out a family because the child safety locks are very nice. People who are looking for a sporty and fast car to show off to their friends should not invest in a neon. also, people who need to use their car for packing a lot of stuff (camping, etc) probably shouldn't, either.<br><br>
