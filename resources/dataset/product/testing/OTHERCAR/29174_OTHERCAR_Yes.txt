            MY PREREQUISITES
A former Volvo wagon owner, I am very interested in vehicle engineering and safety.  When I began shopping around for a new car for my family (of 5), safety was at the top of my checklist.  Other considerations were seating capacity, durability, and winter driving - Midwestern winters almost REQUIRE 4-wheel-drive.

THE CAR
- 4 speed automatic transmission
- 2.5 litre engine, 4 cyl.
- multi-point fule injection
- heated wipers & mirrors
- 4 channel, 4 sensor anti-lock brakes
- sound system
- power door locks, seats, windows
- dual airbags
- seatbelt pre-tensioners and force-limiters


THE TEST DRIVE
When I test drove the Subaru Outback wagon, the salesman had me accelerate on gravel, do tight turns (this thing turns on a DIME and can fit into just about any parking spot), and accelerate on a curve.  The performance of the Outback was incredible!

OTHER PLUSES
Based on its great gas mileage (28 MPG) and ability to fit into small parking spots, you might think this is a tight squeeze for passengers, but the interior is VERY roomy and the cargo area holds strollers, groceries, backpacks and more.  If I have any more children, I would buy a second Outback before getting a larger vehicle.  I am comforted by the dual airbags and other safety features including the reinforced passenger compartment.  I have yet to drive it in snow, but am looking forward to the experience.  The icing on the cake is the winter package - seat warmers and heated windshield wipers.  I love my Outback and actually look for reasons to drive it!
