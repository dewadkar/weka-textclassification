            I have now had my Kodak DC4800 camera for a week, and I'm almost ready to retire my non-digital camera.  First, I need to tell you that I'm an avid scrapbooker.  It is not unusual for me to take 4-5 rolls of film at a weekend event (ie. car show, church activity, etc.) and I obviously don't like to waste my time with low-quality pictures.  I'm a little hesitant to get rid of my tried and true Advantix camera (which I've also reviewed).  In fact last weekend we attended a car show and I carried around both cameras taking a lot of duplicate shots "just in case".  Now that I've printed up the shots I took on the digital camera, I'm ready to leave my other camera in the car (just in case the Kodak's battery runs out!).

I won't go into all of the details of all the features since you can get that in many other articles.  I will touch on some of the features that made me decide to buy this camera.  First, I wanted a camera with great resolution.  I have an older digital camera that's resolution is so low the pictures are horrible when printed out.  This is the cheapest camera that boasts 3.1 megapixels.  Also, I wanted something that wasn't going to be difficult to use with my computer.  USB is one of my favorite means of connecting peripherals.  The setup and installation took maybe 15 minutes (I was in and out of the computer room at the time) and within half an hour I was printing up a few tests.  Another plus, is that you can use the SmartFlash card with several printers without even using a computer (I love my Epson Stylus Photo 785EPX... I will be doing a review on it in the next few days).  

The memory card that comes bundled with the camera is a 16mb card.  It holds around 14 pictures at the highest resolution.  (I choose the highest resolution since I can always trim it down with my graphics program later). At the time I bought the camera, I also bought a 64mb card that holds around 55 pictures at the highest resolution.  (Remember I take lots of pictures at a single event.)  I also borrowed a battery from my sister who has the same camera just in case.  However, I used the camera all weekend and took almost 50 pictures without having any problems at all.  In fact, I just recharged today (a week later) since the battery was showing half-charged.  

This camera is really easy to use.  It is as simple as turn the power on, look at the display, and shoot.  I have had some problems adjusting to the location of the shutter button (the one that actually takes the picture).  I've turned the camera off several times instead of taking a picture.  This is just a difference from the camera I usually use, I'll eventually get it figured out!  Immediately, you are shown a preview of your picture and offered the option to trash it.  If you want to keep it, you just wait a second or two until the camera saves it.  Then you're ready to go again.

From this point, there are several options as to how to get your pictures printed.  That all depends on what kind of printer you have, if you decided to send it to a Kodak Picture Maker (located at many stores), or e-mail it.  The software packaged with the camera makes all of these options readily available and even offers some fun effects (black and white, sepia tone, and slide shows).

Overall:  I have to say I'm ready to go digital with my pictures.  This camera has been easy to learn it's basic use and I'm sure there's a lot more I still will learn in the upcoming weeks.  I'll be sure to add an update after I've used the camera for a longer time.
