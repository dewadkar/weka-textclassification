            This car rocks my world - it is my adventure-mobile!  Lots of great things to say about my Pathfinder:

*Very sturdy and handles all conditions - I can fly through snow and ice while the little cars are slipping and sliding!

*Seated up high - for a short person like me, it's nice to have a full range of view and be able to see all potential hazards

*Lots of space - I've hauled 8 fraternity guys in this car, as well as handled 2 cross-country moves with ease

*Unfortunately not spectacular gas mileage, but that's the same for any SUV, I think

*Very safe - I feel quite protected by all the metal around me and I'm comfortable having this as a family car<br><br>
