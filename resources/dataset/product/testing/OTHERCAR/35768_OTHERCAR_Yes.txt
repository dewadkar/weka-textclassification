            I've owned a Toyota, a VW, several Fords, and now I can add a Honda to my list.  I purchased a 2003 Honda Accord 4 Door V6 two months ago and I absolutely love it.  I was somewhat disappointed to read that heated mirrors aren't on the U.S. models, however I drove off the lot with the Accord anyway. The leather seats are of quality and wrap around you.  On cold winter mornings the heated seats are a nice touch.  Passing traffic on the freeway is no problem with the V6 model.  I didn't even test drive the 4 cylinder Accord.  I wanted 240 horses pulling me along.  The coolest feature is the remote and it's options.  To start, the key and the keyless remote are rolled into one.  Somewhat like the VW keys except no button to press to pop the key out.  You can also roll down all of the windows by pressing the unlock button 3 times.  The salesman didn't even know that little fact! I only discovered it by accident :-)  However, I don't understand why Honda allows you to roll down the windows with the remote, but you can't make them roll back up.  
There is no outside antenna.  The antenna is located in the back glass.  So far I've had better then average reception when traveling out in the country (my parents live in the boonies!)  The 6 disc in dash CD changer is also nice.  

To me, creature comforts are a blessing.  The dual zone climate control is great, especially when my husband complains he is hot.  We can turn down the temperature on his side of the car.  Safety is a key issue with this Accord.  Mine has front and side airbags and side curtain airbags in the back seat also.

In the 2 months I've had this car I've gotten pretty good gas mileage.  It has a HUGE gas tank.  I'm averaging in the upper 20's in the city and about 30 mpg on the highway.

Insurance: my insurance on the Accord is slightly higher then on other cars I've owned.  I expected it though, considering Honda models are always on the Insurance most stolen list every year.

Overall I'd say the new Honda Accord is a great car.  I'm glad I decided to purchase it.  I got all the creature comforts I wanted at a price I consider reasonable.
