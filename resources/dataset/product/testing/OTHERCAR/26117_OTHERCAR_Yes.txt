            <B>Picture quality:</B> 8/10
I was impressed with the quality of the pictures that this camera took, considering the price.  I expected a little grainy, or blurry.  Instead I was treated to relatively sharp clear images, not always the best in dark places, but not too bad. 

<B>Battery Life:</B> 9.5/10
I was impressed with the battery life on this one, I'm still using the same batteries that I got when I got the camera a while ago... I'm not sure how much longer they'll last, but they've already exceeded my expectations.

<B>Ease of transfer to Computer:</B> 10/10
Hey, it has a USB connector, what could be easier... truly plug and play

<B>Price:</B> 9/10
I only paid $149.99 for it, which is very reasonable for a digital camera 

<B>Overall:</B> 9/10
Overall it is a great camera, if you're on a budget it will fill your needs nicely.
