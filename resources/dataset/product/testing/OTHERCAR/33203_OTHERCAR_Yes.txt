            We bought our 1998 used with about 5000 miles on it. Our two previous vans were dodge caravans and we loved them. The van we bought is not a high top so it is not as fancy as others you may find but very nice anyhow.
I love the feeling of being higher then regular cars.. it gives me a sense of added safety.There are four captains chairs and a beach seat. The bench seat also serves as a bed when unfolded. 
There have been problems with the van. First the large windows have leaked since day one. We have had it in the show three times yet if it rains hard the calking on the windows lets water in.
Secondly the front brakes went at 20,000 miles. This was not covered under warranty and was very costly.
Thirdly you need to carry a  gas station with you as it eats gas like a elephant eat peanuts.
ALl in all I would buy another van although next time I would buy new<br><br>
