            I wanted an inexpensive SUV and started looking around in 1997.  I drove
the RAV-4 and liked it's sporty looks.  However, lack of back seat room caused me to look further to the CRV.  I purchased it, my first Honda, in 1997.

On the plus side, it is now over two years old and has 58,000 miles on it.  Has never been back to the shop for anything and still does not have a single rattle in it.  As for handling, it suits my style of driving just fine which is at or slightly above the speed limit and always on pavement.  I never had any occasion to use the all wheel drive system but feel more confident just knowing it is there.  Some complain about the rear tailgate openings but I like it this way.  Smaller items can be place in the back just by opening the back window.  Since I have not tried to load anything in the back while parallel parked, I do not care which direction the tailgate swings.  The ride is very good and better than lots of cars.  It is far superior to any truck-like SUV.  The CRV is roomy, economical, and fun to drive.

On the minus side, I find the driving position to be slightly uncomfortable for more than a few hours.  I wish there was a center console and more horsepower (now it has).  I would also like larger wheels and more insulation from road and wind noise.  I also do not like the position of the power window controls.

However, for about $20,000 and lots of luxury features, I am very well pleased overall.  I am also impressed with Honda quality and this probably will not be my last.
