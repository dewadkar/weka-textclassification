            This car is the BOMB!  I researched it on the internet and then took myself to the dealership.  The price, size and features were everything it was made up to be!  This car has been NO dissappointment in the slightest!  We are a family of four, middle class, and needed a good get around town car, with good gas mileage. We found it and we LOVE it!

We got ours FULLY LOADED for around $13,000.00.  (What a super price.)

I liked the fact it had four doors.  The split 60/40 back seats with three shoulder seat belts and the child seat latches.  The trunk is very roomy. The windows came all etched with the VIN number for safety. The stereo system has a safety feature and a CD player with six speakers. (great sound)  There is lots of nooks and crannies for &quot;junk&quot; you might accumulate and the glove compartment is split.  I can keep my car papers in the larger compartment and my cell phone safe outta sight in the smaller compartment. There is plenty of body and head room in the front and back seats for seating five comfortably. 

The gas mileage is &quot;AWESOME&quot;  We put about twelve dollars in gas in the car once a week and drive like crazy. Recently we took a trip from Mansfield, TX to Columbus, GA and spent sixty dollars roundtrip, including the driving while we were there.  We are thinking about taking it on our next trip also.  It handles supurb on the roads.  The dials being over to the right side make it safer, so you are not looking through the steering wheel to see how fast you are going. Plus You keep your eyes on the road more. The car has alot of &quot;get up and go&quot;. 

This car is for a small family, with teenagers learning to drive!  This car is not for the SUV or upper class family, who's most important quality in a car is either size or price. If you test drive this car, drive it for more than three minutes and you will see why it is a good car to buy. Both our teenagers are fighting over who gets it as their car when they turn sixteen.  The body style is cute and simple.
