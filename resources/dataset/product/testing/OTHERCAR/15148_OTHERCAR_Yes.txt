            About three years ago we bought a 1996 Grand Am SE. It was a perfect little family car. We had a new baby so we really needed something that was dependable for me to drive. This car was wonderful. It didn't have many options but it was a 4 door and that made it really easy to get our daughter in and out. 

We never had any problems with our car. It drove very smooth and was easy to handle even in the winter. The gas mileage was great, as opposed to our big Dodge truck!

A few months ago we traded it in on a Dodge truck. Now I really miss my Grand Am! I think that this car would be perfect for just about anyone. It drives really good, and if you take care of it, you won't have any visits to the shop. Our Grand Am was quite affordable also. It is just an overall great vehicle that is dependable and worth the money you pay for it!<br><br>
