            I purchased my car in November 1999 with 82K miles on it (black coupe).  I wanted to buy a sports car that was fast, but I didn't want to spend too much money.  A friend informed me of this car, and with little hesitation or research, I purchased the car.  

In case you are unaware, this car has 4 cylinders and is 3.0Liters.  It produces 236hp and 225ft/lb torque - giving it better raw power than the Boxster.  It features something called VarioCam which gives you a greater power band above 4000RPM.  

You should be able to find this car with 70-90K miles for between 15-20 for the coupe and 20-25 for the convertible.

Shortly after I purchased the car, I discovered that it was suffering from a pinion bearing failure.  BUYERS WATCH OUT.  This is a common problem found in the cars (coupes and conv.) with manual transmissions.  You have this problem if you hear a whirring noise (like and airplane engine) coming from the back of the car while driving it 30-60 mph.  You will actually always hear it, but that is the best speed to tell.

It cost me $1500 to get this fixed at a dealer in NJ.  I would strongly advise anybody who is considering buying the car to get this checked out.

In any case since I had this problem fixed, I have been somewhat pleased with the car.  It is expensive to maintain.  Count on spending around $2000k/year on this car, especially if you take it to the track.

Porsche recommends getting the belts changed every 30k miles on this car.  That costs around $700.  If you buy a car with 70-90K miles on it, you should expect to replace (if it hasn't been done already and depending on usage): brake pads, rotors, tires, some dash lights, etc.  All of these things will add up to expensive maintenance items year to year.  

Also you may notice some fading in paint on the rocker panels in front of the rear wheels - especially if the car has been driven on the track. This is from the dirt that the front tires kick up.  This is normal - Porsche sells a clear plastic &quot;sticker&quot; than can be applied to good rocker panels that will protect them from the sandblasting.

If you are willing to spend this money on the car, then you are in for an awfully fun ride.  This car is very fast and is awesome to drive.  On the track - when compared to other Porches it keeps up with all but the modified Turbos and the 996s (newest 911s).  It can almost keep up with the 993s (911 generation before current one) and will run with the 964s (generation of 911s before 993 - they were produced at the same time as the 968s).  Bear in mind that these comparisons assume that drivers of similar abilities are driving the cars.

On the inside, the car is comfortable and has most of the modern conveniences that you will find in new cars - except cup holders.  The back seats are useless, but since it is a hatchback the storage room is quite large.

Only 6000 968s were sold in the US (3000 coupes and 3000 cabs).  These are unique cars that you don't see everyday.  That is yet another reason why I love mine.<br><br>
