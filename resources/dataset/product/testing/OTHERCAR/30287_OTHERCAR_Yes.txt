            This vehicle was mainly purchased for its space/cargo ability.  It absolutely delivers!  There is a great deal of space in the cargo area and that increases by a factor of two when the rear seat is folded down!  I have never had a problem hauling groceries, card tables, mulch, huge bags of top soil and potting soil, or anything else!  If you are thinking about an SUV because you haul a lot of stuff around, you might want to think of this car instead!

If you have kids or friends under 6 feet, the back seat is great! Plenty of room for two adults.  However, if you happen to have a lot of friends (or relatives) that are over 6 feet in height, the back seat may be uncomfortable for them to sit in as well as get in and out of.

This car has a driver's side air bag and safety shoulder belts that engage when the door is shut and the car is running.  There are also crumple zones in the front and back.  These are safety features that I really enjoy, but one person mentioned that the automatic shoulder belts sometimes bother him.  These shoulder belts can be unlocked at the top like a normal seat belt if you need to take the shoulder belt off for any reason.  The crumple zones work very, very well!  My car was at a dead stop at a stop sign and was rear ended by another car (whose driver was too busy talking on the phone to actually drive, please don't phone and drive!!) going at a fair rate of speed.  The back end crumpled in just as it was supposed to and minor neck strain was the extent of my physical injuries!

Another thing that sold me on this car is that it is dent proof because of the material the car is made of!  So the car doesn't get dings in the parking lot.  Unfortunately, if someone runs into the car in the parking lot and then takes off, whatever panel they hit is shattered and must be completely replaced.  There is no such thing as &quot;body REPAIR work&quot; on a Saturn; either the panel is fine or it must be replaced because it is in fragments.

This car has excellent pick up for a &quot;station wagon&quot; and has impressed friends with sports cars!  As long as you keep up with the scheduled maintenance, this car is incredibly reliable!<br><br>
