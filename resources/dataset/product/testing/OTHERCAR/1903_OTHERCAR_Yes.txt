            I found this camera on eBay for $30.  Sure it was purple, but still.  It was my first and I enjoyed it.  

Fairly easy to operate.  Some people may have trouble though, my father did when he first tried to download the pictures.  

Nice picture quality.  Can hold 32 pictures on lowest quality and that's the only setting I used.  Has a flash which is a plus.  Takes a AA battery and has an indicator to let you know when to change it.  

Fairly compact as well.  About the same as the average 35mm camera.

Has a 10 second timer, which is a nifty little feature.  

I discovered you have to hold the camera steady for about 3-5 seconds after you take the picture, otherwise it will come out blurry.  The subject you're photographing also has to be still for the same length of time...not recommended for taking pictures of young kids.  

My only other complaint is that it's not XP compatible, along with alot of things I'm sure.  So, I have since given the camera to a family member.  Had it for almost two years though and got a lot of use out of it.
