              Great body style,Looks great with black on black - a Real head turner on the streets,i've always wanted this car, and when got it was still surprised by the comfort, power handling and the millage...
   I got it used in early 2002 with 25,000 miles on it by now it has 52,000 ,the car still looks like new.
  With regular maintanance(oil change every 3k miles,fuel filter change),and had the spark plugs and wires changed at 50k the car doesn't show and has no problems. I use only Premium fuel not lower then 93- it cost more but the car runs smooth and quiet. Though the parts are a bit above avarage it is still worth it.
  The rear window is too small and it is hard to see a lot through the rear view mirror,if the fuel tank would be bigger it would also help.     
 The Best thing i like about this car that it was build with the driver being the main point : stereo, AC controls are all tilted toward the driver, and the stirring wheel with all the mantioned controls makes it a real pleasure to drive.
  Too bad they changed the body in 2002, they should have kept the old body i realy don't like the new shape, though it is still same comfort on the inside.
  GM made it really easy for you, just sign up at oldsmobile.com and it'll show you when and what you have to do with the car to keep it running ,also it keeps the expances  in check.
