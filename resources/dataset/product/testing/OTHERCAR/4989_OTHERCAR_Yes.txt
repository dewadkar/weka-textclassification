            This is exactly what you will be saying when you get behind the wheel of this AWESOME little car!! Sure, I know that it is just a Paseo, not a Porsche...BUT.... once you get this machine going you will truly enjoy it! 

I bought my Paseo basically for commuting. I didn't want to spend too much money because driving 50 miles a day, 5 days a week, I knew that the mileage would soon add up. I test drove a GEO Storm and then the salesman said, &quot;Hey, how would you like to give this one a try.&quot; What a drive!!! I fell in love right away! The pick up and go is quick and fast!!! For my $$'s this car was a steal!!! 

If you are looking for a good, sporty little car with great gas mileage that can make commuting to work or school, then this is the one for you!!!<br><br>
