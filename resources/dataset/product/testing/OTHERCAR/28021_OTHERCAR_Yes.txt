            Let me give you a little background that led me to buy this car.  I was driving a 97 sunfire and had to take it in for some minor work.  As a loaner, they gave me a Grand Am.  On the way home, I decided that this was a car I had to have.  I had twice as much room inside the car and a lot more gidde up and go that with the Sunfire.  I had test drove many of the competitions cars that are compared to the Grand Am and was not highly impressed.  Then I drove the Grand Am.  Now as with all cars, I did find things about this car that I disliked, but they were small when I thought about the overall scheme of things. Let me tell you a little about the plus side of this car.

First of all, I found the engine in this car to be suprisingly powerful.  I had assumed that with only a 4 under the hood and the size of the car, I wouldn't have quite the power of the V6 that comes with the GT model.  Boy was I wrong.  The 2.4 4 cylinder engine can hold it's own quite well.  Living in Pittsburgh, I have a lot of hills to climb and I regularly pass cars going uphill with ease.  Another feature that I really liked about this particular model was the interior room.  One of the first passengers that I had in my car that had to ride in the back was my father.  He stands 6'6&quot; and weighs in at about 250lbs.  Not a small man by any means.  He said that he could sit very comfortably in the back seat of this car.  That really impressed me, my dad always complains about sitting in the back seat.  The most impressive feature, in my opinion, is the way the car handles.  As many of you may know, Pittsburgh is notorious for poor roads.  This car is able to maneuver quite well around all the winding and pothole filled roads that I transverse each day.  I have to say this is what has impressed me the most.

Although I really like  this car, there are several things that I would like to see upgraded in future models of this class.  First of all is the lack of alloy wheels.  This should be a standard option on all cars, but is not on this model.  Alloy wheels make you ride some much smoother as well as enhance the beauty of the car.  Another feature that I do not find to appealing is the audio system.  The standard car only comes with an AM/FM cassette.  I feel that all cars should come with CD.  This is not that big a deal, but still a thing I found annoying.  I will say that changing out the system is very easy, the dash is simple to work with.  Overall, there was not a whole lot that I was displeased with.

If you are in the market for a solid car, either for you or a family, I think that you will really find the Grand AM SE to your liking.  The price is very reasonable and the quality is superb.<br><br>
