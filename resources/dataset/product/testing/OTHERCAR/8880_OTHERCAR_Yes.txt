            We bought this sporty car in 1998.  It is the GS 3-door hatchback.  We opted for the premium package, including AC, power moon roof, aluminum alloy 16&quot; wheels, power windows/ door locks, cruise control, AM/FM stereo w/ cassette, 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, and fog lights.

We opted for the automatic transmission because my wife does no drive a standard.  I have driven the standard and it is quicker but the automatic is surprisingly peppy.  The 4-2.0L-FI Engine is sufficient for this lightweight, sporty car.  The ride is excellent.  It is a very smooth, solid ride.  On the highway you don't even realize how fast you are going and it is very easy to speed.  This car handles superbly.  You definitely know you are in a sports car when taking a turn sharp and hard.  The overdrive is great and we use it whenever going a constant speed over 45 mph.  The seats are comfortable, but could be a little tight for larger people.  The back seat is tight for adults.  The trunk space is plentiful for a sports car and easily accessible.  We get about 25 miles/gallon.  Another plus is the heating/air conditioning system.  No matter how hot or cold, this car reaches the temperature you want QUICK!  It is a pleasure to travel in this car.

This wouldn't be a quality review if I didn't list some faults with this car.  Although my wife says I am wrong, I especially notice the blind spots (maybe because I drive a Jeep where there are none).  Also the back end is high and fat.  You have to sit up in the driver's seat to go in reverse.  It is hard to see over the tail end.  This car also tides low to the ground.  Make sure you go very slow over any bump or depressed curb.  Also make sure that you test drive this car and are OK with the vision restrictions.

All in all, this is a great running, fun to drive car and we are happy we bought it.<br><br>
