            The price? Well, base MSRP (which is what it�ll cost you for the foreseeable future) is $49,907 with the $570 destination charge included. This is WITHOUT options. However, the Sports Package would add $2470. Suffice it to say the X5 has a VERY long list of standard features already, some of which include dual zone automatic A/C, an alarm system with keyless entry, traction control, leather seating with dual 8-way power front seats, six airbags for the front passengers (and four available as an option for the rear passengers), a memory system for he armrest is quite unique in design, and there is plenty of storage space in the map pockets, the center armrest, and behind the shifter. There seem to be an abundance of power outlets in this vehicle, both front and back (I counted 5). The seats were very supportive and comfortable (my vehicle had the sport package, which included the sport seats), and the Xenon headlamps floodlit the road ahead of me, making it almost as bright as day. (but I know how annoying they can be to oncoming traffic). Oh, did I mention that BMW�s new 5-speed Steptronic transmission comes standard with every X5? This is basically their version of the Tiptronic used in Audi/Porsche/VW, or the Sports Shift used in Honda/Acura. For those just arriving from Mars, this is basically an automatic transmission that when shifted into Steptronic mode, one has a separate shift gate to tap the shifter up or down to go up or down a gear as they see fit. However, unlike a manual transmission, there is no clutch. The X5�s Steptronic does have the annoying tendency of shifting up a gear if your speed goes above a certain limit. I already knew these manumatic shifters shifted down automatically when your speed decreases below a preset limit, but I didn�t know they now control upwards shifting if you�re not quick enough to do it yourself. Now I do. Anyway, all in all it makes the X5 significantly more sporty and responsive than a normal automatic would have. 
Summary 
Overall, the 2000 BMW is a fantastic rush to drive. If you have always wanted the commanding view, hauling/towing ability, and AWD stability of an SUV-like vehicle, combined with the handling of a BMW 5-series sedan, this is the only vehicle that matters. The Mercedes ML 430 may come closest (MSRP with freight, $44,395.00), but although it is very car-like and luxurious concerning ride, it just doesn�t handle as well in the sense of a true luxury sports sedan. Perhaps the Mercedes ML55 (MSRP with freight $65,545.00) would be a better comparison, but you pay much more, wait for the right, and even then, I don�t know that the handling will be the same. The same goes for the Lexus RX300 (MSRP with freight $35,100.00, and note that this is with a V6, not V8 (there is no V8 offered on the Lexus, although BMW is planning to offer an X5 3.0i (a larger version of the 2.8 liter inline 6 cylinder engine used on the 328 and 528 series vehicles, with more horsepower and torque as well) in the coming months). 

I like vehicles that do it all, without compromise. The X5 offers this in my opinion. 

So for once, a manufacturer has correctly created an acronym-laden description that is not just a fancy name to stand out: The BMW X5 Sport Activity Vehicle. If you have the means, I definitely recommend trying one. I have no reservations about saving a space for it in my 10 car garage (if and when I have one). <br><br>
