<b>PROS OF THE JETTA</b>

The Jetta is very fun to drive. It handles very well in all conditions, especially in snow. We lived in Colorado at 7,500 ft. and often drove in ice/snow/sleet/blizzard conditions up and down mountainous roads with never a problem. Jettas are front-wheel drive. Both of mine are manual and have never had a problems. There is a lot of torque in these and you would be surprised it's only a 4 cyl....although you can get a 6 cyl. version. I can tell a difference in the handling between #1 and #2 because #2 has alloy wheels...better response. The steering wheel is very "fat" like a Mercedes which you can really get a good, comfortable grip on.

The trunk is HUGE. You would never guess how big one is until you see it for yourself. Surprisingly, it is the feature that always got the most "oooh's and ahhhh's" from friends. The interior is also roomy in front for a medium sized person (I'm 6 ft., 155 lbs.) and the back sits 2 adults comfortably as well. There is a nice, large armrest that comes down in the back. Also, the rear seats DO fold down completely flat incase the massive trunk is still not big enough.

The MPG are usually about 28 H/ 22 C. I am not sure if I am the best or worst stick shift driver so those estimates may vary.

Road noise is very minimal, even with the sunroof open. The car is a solid one. Let me explain, if you shut the door of say, a Pontiac or Ford...it makes a "slam" noise. If you shut the door of say, a Mercedes...it makes a deep "thunk". Well, the Jetta gives a fairly deep "thunk", giving you that sense of security. Also, the horn on these things is VERY loud and intimidating...will definitely be heard by the person about to side-swipe you.

The power locks are operated with the key from outside of the vehicle. When locked, the alarm is activated. You hear a beep and the LED light blinks. If you have power windows and/or a sunroof, you can open all or close all by simply holding the key in a certain direction when locking or unlocking it from the outside (like in the commercial for new ones).

The wipers...WIPE. Something all my other cars were not good at.

<b>CONS OF THE JETTA</b>

I hate to admit it, but there are a few small "issues" that both #1 and #2 share at times. Here they are:

The rear-view mirrior in both of mine slightly vibrates and makes a noise while doing this sometimes. It's not very loud, but can drive you INSANE.

The LCD display on the stock radio will on display 50% of the graphics once it reaches a certain age (what age, I'm not sure). So remember how many clicks it takes to get to your favorite station.

The power locks have a temper that flares up once in a blue moon. You go to your car, insert the key, try to turn to unlock...but it won't budge. If you gently jiggle it up and down, that usually frees it. However, I was once "locked out" for 9 hours and still don't know of a way around this if/when it happens again. Also, on #1, one time the whole lock cylinder for the driver's side door "popped out"! The car could still be secured, but it was not a good feeling. Got it fixed for free.

That's it for cons...honestly.

I highly recommend VWs to anyone. They are very safe (go check the government's car test reports). I would opt for the 1996 before the 1995 model however because according to Consumer Reports, this "electrical" problem was only with the 1995 models. However, don't let that deter you from your purchase if it is indeed a 1995. The cons mentioned above and tiny, and the lock stuff is a <b>very</b> rare occurrence.

Good luck finding, and bargaining on you new Jetta!
