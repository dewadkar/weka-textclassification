            Introduction
So what the heck is this thing!?! Thats what I wondered, I've never heard of Diatsu, Dhiatsue, or yeah, Daihatsu. That is, until a friend of a friend got one. This is pretty close to, if not, the first mini-SUV. Its well worth its weight in Yen.

So what they heck is it?
Surprisingly enough, it was imported from Japan by Cadillac. The Rocky was made from 1990 to 1993. It has Dual OverHead Cams(DOHC) in a small four-cylinder engine, we have never been able to determine the size, it is fairly small. Sadly, Daihatsu has either pulled out of the United States market or they went out of business. I'm hoping for the first.

Pro's
Well, lets see, this thing is a very nice little SUV.

First of all, with the little engine, you can expect well over 30 mpg, probably closer to 35. Once while four wheeling it, we went well below empty(sweating; we were), for an estimated total of 500 miles on the gas tank which holds 15 gallons.

The four wheel drive worked very well, this thing would go anywhere my Blazer would go, and then some.

This thing was after the heart of the SLK Kompressor lovers. With a removable hardtop in the rear, and a flip-up sunroof in the front.

We don't know the exact mileage, since the speedometer and the odometer haven't worked since they aquired the vehicle in 1995. They have made four round trips to Chicago from the Grand Canyon, and it is a daily driver of at least 20 miles a day, sometimes as much as 200 miles a day twice a month. My estimate is that this vehicle easily has 200,000 miles on it, with nothing mechanically wrong. The spark plugs are very easy to change, with the right wrench, and everything else mechanically speaking is easy to do.

Even with a not so great 16 year old driver, abusing it daily, this thing is holding up great. I don't know who made the engine, if it was Daihatsu or if they bought premanufactured engines. I'd guess that Honda built the engine since it has been so reliable.

Neutral
With the sunroof up on bumpy roads, it rattles, a lot. On smooth roads it is pretty quiet.

This thing easily seats four people. There isn't much more room than that, but for a compact SUV, what do you expect? There is very little room behind the rear seat.

The Spare tire somewhat hinders backing view, but nothing to worry about, and not nearly as bad as Jeep Wranglers or (Who the heck makes this?) Amigo's.

Since I think this was Daihatsu first attempt at four wheel drive, Manual hubs are excused. They still suck, and I've had to get out one too many times in the mud to lock them.

Cons
With a little four-banger, do you expect power? I don't, and you certainly don't get it. 0-60 as tested in a race against my Blazer is just under 22 seconds. Being the boring town of Grand Canyon, we have little to do but mess with our cars. We even know the 1/4 mile time. 21.5 second at 66 mph. For those of you who don't know what this means, between 17 and 19 seconds is average for most family cars. A Corvette will do the quarter mile in 13.3 seconds.

Never fear, this thing will hold freeway speeds, and highways speeds, just don't try to go up steep inclines at the speed limit.

Don't expect to tow anything. At least in my Blazer the V6 puts out quite a bit more torque than horsepower(210 torque to 173 hp), in this, thats not the case. My guess is about 100 horsepower, and 100 ft. lbs. of torque. It can barely pull around four average males, let alone any size trailer.

Overall
This little SUV is ideal for college students that want a little bit of attitude to their Geo. It will go anywhere, muddy or not, and we have never felt that we compromised our safety while &quot;romping&quot; it.

If you don't mind being slow, but getting great gas mileage, this is for you. The reliability is great, the comfort is too, just don't plan on hauling all of your friends and all of their stuff around.
