            My situation when I bought my Saturn was: my other car broke down completely, and barely coasted into the car lot that I bought it (The Saturn) from. 
I had always heard wonderful things about Saturns and wanted one, but wasn't sure that I could afford it.
We paid only $9,000 for ours, and we have now had it 2 years without much more than maintenance and upkeep. 
It only holds about 10 gallons of gas, and gets at least 35 mpg. It has a nice stereo, nice interior, and it has great safety features (airbags, child door locks, ect..) that helped keep my insurance very cheap.
Simply put, I wouldn't trade my Saturn for any other kind of car. And when it finally does wear out, I will be at the lot shopping for another one!<br><br>
