                 A few years ago a friend sold me his 1987 Toyota pick-up with 180,000 miles on it. Given the track record of my previous cars (mostly Fords), I gave it one year to live. At 227,000 miles I am still using it to commute to work and it is showing no signs of needing to be put on any sort of life support. Being the practical sort of guy that I am, when it came time to upgrade the &quot;family&quot; car I was dead set on getting another Toyota. I settled on the Previa mostly out of a need for a vehicle that could safely transport my kids, my affinity to small non-gas-guzzling peppy engines, and the fact that monthly payments for 4Runner would have killed me.
     We found one that was just coming off lease whose owners wanted to upgrade to a Sienna (also big Toyota fans). The supercharged 2.4 liter engine helped soothe the bruises to my ego involved with becoming a minivan owner. The van easily keeps up with vehicles that I know are more mechanically endowed and it absolutely screams when the AC is turned off. It didn't take me long to get used to the advantages of putting acres between my two kids on trips and not worrying about dinging the next car over in a parking lot with my sliding side door. The ability to break the rear seat in half and individually fold each half up into the side of the vehicle, however, gave it a distinct advantage most minivans didn't have.
    Drawbacks are few but include limited driver's leg room (especially with the drink holders out or something plugged into the cigarette lighter), difficulty placing a child into a carseat from the sliding door entrance, a driver/front-passenger reading light that totally blinds the driver, and poor engine accessibility. With 17,000 of our own miles now on the van, the biggest problem we've had has been a &quot;check engine&quot; light coming on twice. The Toyota mechanic gave a vague explanation that it may be anything from a pre-set maintenance light to an over-filled gas tank. Either way it's a required trip to a Toyota shop to have it reset, unless you happen to own a Toyota vehicle diagnosis computer.  From what I've seen, though, this will be the worst thing that happens to a vehicle that probably will never die.
