            I'v owned my 98 Trooper for 15 months. I've enjoyed the truck for the most part. 
Good cargo space,Great Styling that separates it from the herd of SUVs out there.The multi-disc indash cd player is a nice touch(when it's working) and shifting in to 4 wheel drive is the easiest I've seen.
However there are some short comings with the Trooper. When folding the rear seats forward they do not lock into position.This is a problem that Troopers have had for years.
Front leg room in the trooper is poor. I'm 6.1 and it's barely enough. If
I were taller I probably would not have choose this truck.
Gas mileage in a word is awful, worst than any of my friends with SUVs, matter of fact a couple of my friends whose SUVs have V8s tell me their gas mileage is as good as if not better than mine. However when you buy this kind of transportation Gas Mileage is not that much of a consideration.
All in all the Trooper is capable fun to drive and functional. Loves that 
60/40 rear cargo door, hope Isuzu never gives that up.
If you're looking for a good Truck with great looks and can tow all day anywhere with out any problems this could be the truck for you. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.<br><br>
