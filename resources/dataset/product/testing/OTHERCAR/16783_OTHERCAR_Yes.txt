            As a teenager, I know firsthand that having a cool car is important.  When my mom first bought me the Spirit, I didnt care how it ran, I just thought hey, it's kind of cute!  Of course, my mother cared more about my safety and the car's dependability.  As this past year has gone on, and I've entered college, I drive more and more.  Yet, the Spirit has held up incredibly well.  When I went for it's last checkup, the mechanics were complimenting me on my wonderful car, how beautifully it ran, how incredibly well it was kept up.  Funny thing is, I never even went under the hood.  I never took it to a mechanic, I never had problems with it.  Many of my friends are jealous of my car, because it has that sporty teenage look, it drives great and runs smoothly.  Plus, it came with a great stereo system =).  I wasnt too keen on the idea of a 4 door "family" vehicle, but it's great for loading up my friends and going out.  Now, many of my friends have bought Dodge Spirits, and every single one of them absolutely LOVE these cars.  Dependable, sporty, comfortable, roomy, smooth ride, great all 4 seasons, there is just so much you can say about this car.  It's a great teenage ride, and a parent's dream.  My mom feels safe knowing that I am driving my trusty Dodge Spirit.

**UPDATE 9/28/03** Just a note to all those parents considering a Dodge Spirit. I still highly recommend them to anyone...but watch out for the transmission fluid. It tends to get low, and I didn't know how much to put in so I put in one bottle...well, it needed like 3+ and I blew the transmission. Just a helpful tip!
