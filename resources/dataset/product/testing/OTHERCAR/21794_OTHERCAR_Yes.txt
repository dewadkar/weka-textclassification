            I have a 1996 Tahoe that I love.  The room is just perfect.  Not to big and not to small.  I'm a mother of a 15 month old and am expecting another child in May of 2000.  This vehicle has plenty of room for all our stuff and then some.  Before the Tahoe we drove the extended cab pickups and can't believe how much better we like the Tahoe.  My husband just loves it and he has always driven a truck.  We drove it on vacation and it was so roomy and comfortable.  The one and only complaint I have is that the back seat windows do not roll all the way down.  Which can be a pain when sitting in the back seat. In my opinion this vehicle rides more like a car.  This vehicle is awesome and I would buy it again.<br><br>
