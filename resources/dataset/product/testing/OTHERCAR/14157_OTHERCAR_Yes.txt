            I went shopping for a camera this holiday season. I knew I couldn't afford much, so I wanted something worthwhile under $100. This camera completely fits that bill. Purchased for $99 after the manufacturer's rebate, it's a great bargain! It's smaller than more expensive models, battery life has been great, and it has an LCD panel for framing pictures and setting things up. I also love the smart media -- it's smaller than compact flash and some laptops, like a Toshiba I bought a few months ago, has a built in reader! So I haven't even tried the built-in USB connectivity of the camera -- I just slip the smart media out and stick it in my laptop. Picture quality is excellent for the price range. And it DOES have red-eye reduction -- which some reviewer said it didn't. It also lets you change exposure/white balance settings -- as well as having different automatic modes for different lighting situations.
