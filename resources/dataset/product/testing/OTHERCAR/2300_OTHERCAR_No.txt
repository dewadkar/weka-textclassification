            I bought my '99 Kia Sephia in October of 1999.  I've had nothing but problems with this car.  At the time, I wasn't trying to spend a whole lot of money on something and the Sephia was cute.  So far, I've had a window regulator (makes it go up and down) replaced, brakes replaced two times, fuel pump replaced, windshield wiper (the whole thing) replaced and a visor on order for replacement.  It has been a total nightmare driving this &quot;thing&quot; around, you never know what new adventure it will take you on.  I wouldn't even recommend this as a first car for a teenager, unless you like being at the dealer.  The only people that should be allowed to drive this car are the people that work for Kia.  All in all, I have not been happy with my purchase.  Be careful and beware, Kia is definately a no-no.<br><br>
