            This is the fourth Chrysler LH I've owned. First was a 1994 LHS, second a 1995 Concord, third a 1998 Concord and now, the ultimate, a 2001 300M. From it's fantastic exterior styling to it's very luxurious interior, this is a fantastic car. The 250 horsepower (down from 253 last year) is strong, willing and responsive. It's solid and quiet at highway speeds, doesn't gobble gas like an SUV, pampers it's occupants with luxury and it's styling is very distinctive. The luxury option is a must. The genuine California walnut on the steering wheel really sets off the interior. I can't say enough about this car! It has better lines and more power than the Lincoln LS, either V6 or V8, has more interior room and costs $10,000 less. Why would anyone ever consider the Lincoln? Cadillac STS has more horses and a few more luxury gimmicks, but it's $20,000 more. For what? Do yourself a favor. If you can live without the Cadillac or Lincoln names, and want to save 10 to 20 large, consider the 300M. <br><br>
