            Okay, here's another biased review from me. I've always loved Jeeps and I've read up on them since I was 17, and in 1999 I was finally able to afford a new vehicle so I thought, 'Yeah, I'm getting a Jeep'.

In Canada, the Wrangler is called the TJ. Apparently they had made a number of improvements from the older model YJs [I'm not sure if that's what they were called in the U.S.- think older version of Wrangler]. A few of the things they were said to have improved upon are 1) The center of gravity has been lowered, and the wheel base has been widened, decreasing the amount of roll-overs at high speeds. 2) The dashboard looks less utilitarian. 3) The headlights are round again instead of that stupid square 4) The front grill has been changed back to its more classic look, etc.

Before my Jeep my vehicles had always been cars, and although I had had my share of experience driving SUVs, I haven't actually been able to say one was mine. Who knows why I like the Jeep so much over any other SUV. I think it's because, since it was the original, all the other ones are posers. Plus, Jeep tends to encourage the owners of their vehicles to bring them off-road, whereas with some of the more expensive SUVs,I couldn't even imagine scratching the paint on them. Jeep hosts what's called a Jeep Jamboree every year and invites all Jeep drivers to them. Very little has to be done to them to bring them up to their requirements.

The Jeep TJ [Wrangler] is not a very smooth driving vehicle in the city- but that's why I like it. It was meant for off-roading. It's got a stiff suspension and shocks, high clearance from the wheel well, and a very surprising turning radius. You will feel the slightest bump in the pavement, but that's a good thing for when you are in the bush. You won't bottom out in this vehicle. Then again, you still don't want to make a turn in this Jeep at high speed; you can't drive it like a sportscar.

You don't need a V-6 unless you're towing things, and that means more fuel economy with an I-4. Granted, you don't get as much power up steeper hills, you'd have to downshift into 2nd gear, but who says that's a bad thing? Oh, by the way, if you get a TJ, don't wuss out and get an automatic transmission. Manuals are a lot more fun and they give you a lot more control over your speed and braking. The engine is loud but that's what you get with a vehicle like this.

There's a surprising amount of headroom in the back. It's a four-seater. The seats are comfortable. The only bad thing is the storage space- there's very little of it. But I expected that when I bought it. Also, if you don't have a hard top, the vehicle isn't very secure. And the hood can be opened from the outside, which means that people with bad intentions can fiddle with your engine or take your battery. I had the hood latches replaced with locking ones after my Jeep was broken into. 

I'm waiting for the weather to dry up so that I can start off-roading. British Columbia is said to have some of the best trails in North America. This is going to be fun.
