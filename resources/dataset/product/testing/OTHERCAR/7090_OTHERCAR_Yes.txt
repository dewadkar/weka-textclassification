            We bought this car as a return lease 10 years ago during the coldest December in Idaho for just over $9000.00.  Other than basic maintenance, tires, shocks, mufflers, and pretty regular oil changes (every 3000 and 4000 miles) we have not had any real problems.  Total non-regular maintenance repair bills have totalled about $400 to $500.  Currently have almost 140k miles and still going great.  It has mainly been used as commuter car (25 miles each way per day) for the last 10 years.  The model we bought has just the 2.2L engine so it's not real peppy but it gets you from A to B just fine.  My parents bought the 3.2L engine and it has much better pickup.  All in all cannot complain about the price or performance.
