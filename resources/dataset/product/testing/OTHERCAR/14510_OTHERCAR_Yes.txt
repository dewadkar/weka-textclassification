            Despite its shortcomings, I'm very happy with my Toyota RAV4 and I haven't seen another vehicle in the small SUV category that I would want instead.  I used to have a Toyota pickup and that vehicle convinced me of the quality of Toyota products so when I wanted an SUV with a little more interior space the RAV4 was the natural choice.  From the first time I saw pictures of it before it was available in the USA, I knew it was the SUV for me.  I even saw it in Germany before it was available in the US and could hardly wait until it was introduced into the US market.

PROS:  The styling of the RAV4 is clean and elegant.  Its large wheels give it a rugged off-road look, and the rounded proportional body always draw a glance.  The two features that originally drew me to the RAV4 were the good gas mileage (I average somewhere around 24mpg) and the full-time 4WD.  The handling is car-like and quite sufficient for the urban jungle.  I've used my RAV4 for transporting quite a few things in the roomy interior.  I was able to fit a 4 foot by 4 foot mirror in the back and many times have put in multiple 8 foot 2x4s with room to spare.  I'm 6'2&quot; tall and have plenty of headroom in both the front and rear seats.  The RAV4 can also serve as sleeping quarters in a pinch.  First move the passenger seat forward as far as it can go, remove the headrest and recline it until it's horizontal.  Then recline the rear seat until it's horizontal.  With a few well placed pillows I was able to sleep fully outstretched quite comfortably through the night along with my dog on the seat next to me.  The RAV4 inherits the Toyota reliability.  I've put over 40,000 miles on mine with no problems, in fact I think it runs better today than it did when I got it.  I got mine with the anti-lock breaks and I would highly recommend paying the extra money to get them.  I've been in a few situations where the anti-lock breaks came in quite handy and they worked like a charm.  I also got the limited-slip differential, but since I don't do any off-road driving I imagine it has limited value except maybe for resale.

CONS:  The biggest problem I have with my RAV4 is the interior noise.  You can hear a lot of wind noise and road noise when driving at highway speeds.  It makes long drives a little harder and it makes listening to music a little less enjoyable.  They may have improved this in the newer model years, but I imagine some of it has to do with the high profile of the car causing wind noise.  The car doesn't have a tremendous amount of power but it's not too bad with the standard transmission (I imagine it's more of a problem with the automatics).  I will gladly give up the power for the better gas mileage.  I know that the newer models have a couple of more horsepower but I can't imagine it's enough to make much of a difference.   One other problem I had was when I didn't quickly wash off some bird droppings that landed on the hood of the car.  I don't know if this is a common problem, but it looked like it actually pitted the clearcoat.  The Toyota dealer was however willing to fix it under warranty.  Some problems that I have with the design that I think could easily be solved by Toyota are the following:  One, the rear door is hard to close when all other doors are close and the windows are up.  It seems to bounce back open a little if you try to slam it without keeping your hand on the door.  Two, it lacks a good cupholder.  I had to buy a cupholder that hooks into the vent above the radio.  Three, the optional center console is a must for an armrest, and the handles on the inside of the front doors aren't designed to be armrests.  This makes for an uncomfortable drive it you like to set one of your arms down on something besides your lap.  Four, the front seats take a little getting used to.  The bottom of the seat is a little short so they catch you a little higher up in the back of your legs and the seat also hugs pretty tight.  The seats are also very firm but once you get used to these differences you don't notice them. Five, the antenna is annoying if you have a low garage door.  Since it is angled back you have to retract it to get out of the garage.  If it was straight up and down it would just flex a bit and not be a problem, but since it's at such an angle it catches on the garage door.  Finally, the tires that came with my RAV4 were mediocre (I think they were Bridgestone Duehler HTs).  They only lasted a little over 30,000 miles.


OVERALL:  I love my RAV4 and would buy another one.  I like some of the features that have come out on newer models, such as tinted rear windows, but I had to have my RAV4 as soon as possible and was willing to sacrifice the incremental improvements of subsequent model years.
