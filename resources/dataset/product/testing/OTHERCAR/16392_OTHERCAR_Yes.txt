             <b>F</b>or the past 4 days I have been working my butt off trying to get the seller of a 1991 Geo Storm hatchback to lower the price of his car from $2,900 to $1,500. The car was recently keyed very badly while in a parking lot so I thought this lowered price would be justified. In the end I bought it for the money I was offering. Why would I want a 'keyed' Geo Storm hatchback? Gas prices in California are on the rise again, and even though my <a href="/content_5491717286898"> Pontiac Sunfire</a> averages 32 MPG I was looking for something that received even better fuel economy.  

<b>NOTE:</b> I used Color Cure by Turtle Wax and the car looks great. <b>Update:</b> Had the car re-painted. 

  <b>F</b>or 1991 the Geo Storm came in 3 trim lines, the base 2 door coupe, the GSI 2 door coupe, and the 2 door hatchback/wagonback. While the GSI came with a very spunky DOHC 1.6 liter unit, the base engine comes in the form of a 1.6 SOHC 12 valve power plant that pumps out 95 horsepower at 5,800 RPM, and 97 lb-ft of torque at 4,800 RPM. Transmission options include a 3-speed automatic, a 4-speed automatic, and a 5-speed manual transmission which is standard on all three trim lines and equipped on my car.

<b>Transmission Gripes:</b> The 5-speed manual is a little too 'low geared'. I feel that a higher geared tranny, although would not be as sporty, would have helped fuel economy even further. I do however love the short throw shifter.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
 

Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is not what you would expect from a car with a small engine that is rated at only 95 horsepower. From a standing start the car revs towards red-line very fast and with that comes relatively peppy acceleration and the sound of a small Japanese engine on the move. This car came equipped with performance tires, so this helps quite a bit; sporty gearing matched with a light curb weight also contribute to the good outright performance. 

<b>Handling</b> is also good, the base hatchback can corner just as well as the GSI coupe and can rival many 'more expensive' cars. The steering does feel a little dead but it doesn't affect handling nor road holding. Torque steer is next to none, with only 97 lb-ft of torque at 4,800 RPM this is to be expected. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the 1991 Geo Storm hatchback is almost exactly like the GSI, a harsh ride is offered, but the trade-off is lots of grip and good handling. Engine, wind, and road noise do play a factor. At 65 MPH the Geo Storm hatchback cruises at around 3,200 RPM which can be heard quite clearly in the cabin and can get quite annoying. With the 97 lb-ft of torque generated from the SOHC 1.6 you would think hill climbing would be awful, but on the contrary it is quite impressive. Even in 5th gear I was able to tackle many hills, only the steepest inclines required me to down-shift into 4th gear. 

<b>Braking</b> is average, the front disc rear drum set-up is a little on the slow side when coming to a stop. The Geo Storm hatchback was not offered with ABS, nor 4-wheel disc brakes. <b>Fuel Economy</b> is excellent! On a 1400 mile round trip from Eureka California to Bakersfield California and back I averaged 39 MPG! I was expecting much less considering the tachometer would sometimes creep up to 3,800 RPM on Interstate 5 while driving 75 MPH. The 91 Geo Storm does not require premium gasoline, but I recommend it anyway due to the noticeable difference in engine behavior.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

 The <b>Interior</b> of the 1991 Storm, unlike many cars produced by GM during this time period, is actually up-to-date for its production year. The dash is relatively modern and offers simple to use ergonomics. All the buttons are at the drivers fingertips, located just outside the instrument cluster. The instrument cluster is also very easy to read and offers plenty of essential gauges. Amenities are scarce, but plenty are provided for a car in this category. A 2 speaker Am/Fm cassette, AC, automatic hatch, tachometer, and a thick plastic steering wheel is provided, unfortunately intermittent windshield wipers are not available. The 1991 Storm hatchback comes equipped with supportive front bucket seats, however much more bolstering would have been welcomed. There is a full folding bench in the rear which provides plenty of cargo space when folded down. Room is adequate up front, but rear leg room is very tight. Thanks to the hatchback design, backseat drivers will enjoy plenty of headroom.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

 "Awkward, weird, Ugly, 'copy cat' Civic hatchback" have all been used to describe the Geo Storm hatchback/wagonback. On the contrary to what many say, I feel the design is actually an interesting twist to the multitude of hatchbacks that were offered in the early 90s. The 91 Storm has semi pop-up headlights, color keyed bumpers, and the door handles are tucked away behind the door giving the appearance that there are no door handles at all. The '91 Storm sits very low, and comes with 14" steel rims. I have opted to go with aftermarket 15" 5 spoke alloys.

<i>Price & Reliability:</i> 


In 1991 a Geo Storm hatchback went for around $12,000, today a low mileage Storm can be bought for less than $3,000, and less than $2,000 in some cases. As for reliability, this car has been excellent, buying this car from the original owner with 96,000 original miles, the only repairs include new belts, hoses, EGR valve, 3 sets of tires, new struts, and 5 wheel allignments. The car passed emissions with flying colors.

<i>Gripes:</i> This car is very rare. If the rear windows need to be replaced it can get quite costly, as the majority of Geo Storms are coupes, so junkyards rarely have them in wagonback form.
