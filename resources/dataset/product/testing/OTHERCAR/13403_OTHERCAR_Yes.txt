            After some hustle and bustle and two dealerships, I finally got to talk to the person that could get me what I wanted. I told the dealership what I wanted- A four door, four wheel drive, fully loaded Blazer with a tow package and undercarriage protection, but no leather seats and my selection of acceptable colors. It took me all of 3 days start to finish to buy my vehicle and have it delivered to the dealership after two weeks of looking for a dealership that could get me the vehicle I wanted. This was two weeks well spent, let me tell you why.

My Blazer is great. I have already put in excess of 86,000 miles on it including many long distance road trips to see my family as well as friends. Most recently I traveled to south Texas. No short trip rest assured, unless you consider two adults, children 7,10 and 11 years old and a dog along with everything we take for any extended period including bikes traveling over 1600 miles one way inside of 30 hours short.

The comfort was superb, the trip down was extremely pleasant with enough room to lower one of the 60/40 split rear seats allowing the kids and dog extra room to spread out and sleep on the long stretches of road. The reclined front passenger seat soundly cradling my navigator as they too rest through the hours of the night. The lumbar support within the drivers seat as well as the fully adjustable electronic seat positioning for the drivers seat making the driver truly comfortable for extended periods.

I have equipped my Blazer with nerf bars to help little ones to climb in and out, but see no need in installing a lift kit as the Blazer already sports a fair amount of ground clearance and the elevation is sufficient to increase road visibility without itself becoming too obtrusive to others views. I still hate getting behind large panel vans because of the obscured view, but in comparison to a car or small pickup I can take in a much better view of road conditions in the Blazer. Another factor which contributes to this are the large windows which completely surround the vehicle allowing a clear view in all directions and the larger styled mirrors reduce the blind spots to a minimum. The only Blind spot that has ever been a concern to me is the strip between the drivers door frame and the windshield which is a problem on any vehicle.

The 4.3 liter Vortex, six cylinder engine provides a smooth and yet powerful performance enabling great control of the vehicle even when you need that extra &quot;Umph&quot;. It is not unusual for me to glance at the speedometer and discover that I am traveling 10-15 miles an hour faster than I thought because of how smooth the ride is, good thing mine has cruise control or it could be a problem. Pulling a trailer behind isn't a problem either because the engine seems to love the challenge even though with the exception of backing and blocked mirror you could forget it was back there. When pulling from a stop into traffic, the Blazer packs enough rev that it jumps into that hole, you know the one half the size the car in front of you could have made it into if he had just gone.

Now the Blazer isn't cheap, mine having cost me almost $30,000, but it performs well above the average SUV. I average 23 mpg on the highway and about 20 mpg locally which is great considering the power that it delivers day in day out. With the current cost of fuel and 52 miles round trip to work I average about $25.00 a week in gas. The fuel tank is 18 Gallons but I don't let mine run down to empty, and I always know no-matter the driving conditions I can go 300 miles on a tank.

The Blazer also has a couple fall backs too, maintenance costs are high. I believe that car dealerships and repair shops base their cost on, is the vehicle stripped down or luxurious because the more you have on your vehicle the more it costs for the same type of repair. Brakes ran me almost $500.00 for lifetime brakes when I had them put on, granted this included, new calipers and rotors as well as the fact my Blazer is four wheel drive. Other things which have required servicing include the alternator going out and in turn killing my battery, and my O 2 sensor going out, thankfully these were covered under warrantee. Unfortunately on my trip to Texas my A/C blower stopped working. After taking it to the shop and discovering that the A/C Clutch had gone out, replacing it and refilling the coolant though, my System is back to cold is real cold and Hot is only moments away.

Now the real test though, I was unfortunate enough to be struck by a drunk driver. It was a cold rainy night, my two kids and I were going to of all places Wal Mart, you know that everyday place that many of us love and that I think my mother should have bought stock in. We were sitting at a traffic light behind several cars, my son and I talking, when BAM!. I had my foot resting on the brake when the truck hit us. I was forced into the car in front of us and that car into the truck in front of it. The police and witness estimated that the gentleman was traveling between 45 and 50 mph when we were struck and he never hit his brakes. 

The vehicle that had struck ours was a large work type truck, a 3500 series Chevy, complete with a metal grill. The back end of my Blazer was struck on the tow hitch which was forced into the vehicle and then came upwards into the rear compartment area pressing the floor upwards, the shocks on both sides were blown out and I literally had 2 inch wide gaps at the top of the rear doors where the roof had been pushed upwards from the side supports on the back end surprisingly no windows were broken though. The front end had stuck the car in front causing one turn signal to be broken and the grill to be broken as well as some scratches to the paint. The bumper absorbed the remainder and ended up having to be replaced as well. Even the frame had been bent having absorbed the strike. 

Over $7,000.00 in repairs and you know what we not only walked away with only minor injuries, I was able to drive my vehicle home and then to the dealership the next day. The lady in front of me couldn't say the same thing. With the impact we had taken serving as a cushion the lady in front of us struck her steering wheel and had to be taken from the scene by ambulance. A Geo Metro is no match for a 4000 pound Blazer, I can only guess how bad she would have been injured if the truck had struck her instead of me. My childrenï¿½s only injury was that they were upset and their stomachs hurt where the seatbelts had restrained them to keep them in place, and my only injury was only a slight whiplash.

Is the Blazer expensive? Yes.
Was it worth the money? Every penny of it!
