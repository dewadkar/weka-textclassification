            I consider myself fortunate that I was able to get a good deal on my 2001 Protege LX 2.0.  Back in April 2001, Mazda had a 4.9% financing rate so I jumped at it, but ofcourse, events have happened and the rate even dropped to zero, but still it was a good deal.  This model when equipped with the 2.0 (which by the way starting in 2002 is the only engine choice) is very peppy in the important stop light get away category.  Mazda has chosen to give us the torque early on instead of running the RPM's up high like some other engines do.  The possible downside is that the engine runs out of steam when you try to go faster than 70 mph, but in my opinion, 99% of my driving is in that all important stop light pull away category and thats why I like it.
For a economy car price, you would expect the interior to match, but Mazda has done a good job here also using a little softer feel of plastic with golf ball feel door handles and a nice padded steering wheel. I also like the instrument panel where everything is clear and with green night lighting instead of red that seems to be the in thing.  Everything is placed where they should be although I have heard complaints about the console being too far back but to me its not a problem.
The back area is very roomy too for a small car, Mazda has done its homework here, when compared to the Nissan Sentra, and the trunk is flat and usefully shaped.
My summary?  I feel that I have bought a very useful, reliable and good looking vehicle.  It came with good incentives and good reviews from all corners.  So far, it has lived up to my standards.
