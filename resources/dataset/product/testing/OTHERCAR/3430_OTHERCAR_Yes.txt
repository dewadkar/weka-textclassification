            ...almost.

I'm in the market for a new car.  I've been driving around in my 1991 Nissan Maxima SE for almost 10 years, now, and though I love the car to death, I think I deserve a new ride.  Currently, there are only 2 cars on the market that I'm interested in, the Acura CL Type S and the Lexus IS300.  I test drove both today, so please check out my upcoming epinion on the Lexus model.  This particular review is on the CL Type S, even though it's categorized under the normal CL (I couldn't find a &quot;Suggest a car&quot; link, what's going on? haha).

The car salesman was one of the nicest I've ever encountered, and when he pulled out of the lot he really showed me what the car could do.  Sure, this is a good thing, but it has it downfalls, which you'll hear about soon.  After leaving the dealer's lot, he hopped onto the local freeway, and immediately punched it.  You've got to believe me, this car pulls, and pulls, and keeps on pulling.  We got up to 120mph in no time and all, and I was amazed.  I had two friends riding along in the back seat, and they were totally fired up from this show of power.  He actually took us on a pretty long drive, which was also really nice.  We took a couple of high speed turns (about 60mph) coming off of the freeway, and the CL Type S held pretty well.  I think some upgraded shocks, springs, and sway bars would have helped the slight body roll, and some upgraded tires would also have been welcome, but I was very impressed by a car that comes with all that power and luxury (including a navigation system), for under $32k!  260HP is the most power I've ever enjoyed in a car, and it was sweet!

So the salesman finally pulls over in a parking lot and hands the wheel over to me.  I should have known that I was going to be in trouble when I took control of the car.  I was so fired up from his demo of the CL, and also figured that he wouldn't mind if I &quot;pushed&quot; the car a little.

Oops.  That was a big mistake.  Normally, when I drive my car, I'll look out to make sure there aren't going to be any issues with me having a little fun.  Today, I wasn't very alert, and I was itching to see what the CL could do.  Unfortunately, I was the very first car at the left turn light outside of the parking lot.  What did I do???  Yup, you guessed it.

The light turned green.  I had the CL in manual mode, and in 1st gear.  I slammed on the accelerator and I've never heard wheels spin up like that before in a passenger car.  I was practically smoking all the way through that turn, and was loving every second of it!!!

Until I saw the cop lights behind me.  I think the first words out of my mouth were &quot;OH SH**&quot;.  Sure enough, he was after me, and why wouldn't he be?  I was being stupid, squealing my tires *all* the way through the turn.  (by the way, I never drive like this, and will definitely never do this again.)  My friends in the back said that the salesman's face looked like this:

=O

haha...

Anyhow, to make a long story short (this is a review on the car, not on my mistakes) he let me off the hook and didn't give me the ticket for &quot;reckless driving&quot;.  Thank you, officer!!!

So what's my opinion on the CL Type S?  If you're looking for power and luxury, you've got the right car.  This baby hauls, and seems to never run out of power all throughout the band.

The interior is very nice.  The black leather looked good, and Acura finishes off the trim with some very nice black wood.  The stereo has an interesting in-dash single slot 6 disc changer, which is extremely handy!  I always hated having to load magazines in the trunk.  The seats are slightly on the harder side, but would still be pretty comfortable on long drives.  And for a coupe, I was very happy with the roominess in the back seat.  My friends, though not very big guys, had ample legroom, which is nice to see in a car like this.  I also loved the racing gauges (black on white).

My only complaint?  The body style.  I think I'd buy this car in a split second if I didn't have to look at it every day of the week.  The hood is strange and angular, and the back end has an overly exaggerated curve.  Even though the (optional) spoiler offsets this look a bit, it's still hard to digest.  Oh, and the &quot;premium&quot; wheels are a disaster just waiting to happen.  Just looking at the demo car that I drove told me everything.  The rims were so scratched up, because the spokes protrude from the edge of the tire!  Not a good design.

I'm still torn between the CL Type S and the IS300.  The CL has the power, the luxury, and the fantastic navigation system!  But the body is the only thing that'll hold me back.

Stay tuned for my IS300 review, coming soon. =)<br><br>
