            In this neck of the woods you just ain't nobody if you're not driving a Chevy Suburban - that is, unless you're the quintessential leggy blonde cheerleader / homecoming queen / yearbook editor / social butterfly. You remember the type from high school, right? the Beverly Hills 90210 candidate who dates the quarterback on the football team, who's fully capable of bringing the entire Chess Club to tears with a single toss of her glossy locks, who'll pledge Kappa within minutes of walking on campus her freshman year in college.  Oh, her? Yeah that's the one; the girl driving the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder convertible...

I'm not certain, but there might be a law against middle-aged men driving one of these things; but if there is, apparently Enterprise doesn't know about it - they let me have one, after all. So if you happened to see a gentleman who appeared to be going through a major mid-life crisis somewhere out on I-10 west of Houston recently, it just might have been me - and to make matters worse, the one I was driving was <i>red</i>!


<b>Looks Count for Everything</b>

The auto industry isn't all that different from high school - looks count for a lot. Oh, sure, you have your stoners (beat-up pickup, dayglow VW microbus) and your nerds (Mercury Grand Marquis, Dodge Neon); but the really hot models in both worlds are the sports cars. And in sports cars, just as in the halls of Pitts High, hot and sexy on the outside counts for a lot more than what's under the hood. So just what is the status quotient of an Eclipse Spyder convertible? Through the roof, that's what it is!

This is one hot-looking little car, make no mistake about it. Just sitting in the parking lot it looks as though it's cruising down the Coast Highway at about 90. It's low-slung, aerodynamic, and has those cathedral-arched wheel wells (the better to fit the 17-inch wheels, of course). Then, too, there's the horizontal ribbing on the doors and a pair of subtle bulges on the hood, plus a steeply raked windshield and that little mini-rainbow spoiler mounted on the rear deck. Yep, she looks hotter than the proverbial firecracker!

Open that looooong (and heavy) passenger door and fold yourself into the driver's seat: you end up looking straight at the bumper on most SUV's; low enough that you can just about see under a 4WD model. When you glance around the cockpit, you'll notice that the Spyder doesn't look quite as tasty from the inside out: almost everything is plastic, and a lot of it doesn't look very expensive. A couple of pewter accents are on the doors and the console, but otherwise everything else on my ride was black. There aren't many bells and whistles on this baby. Oh, sure, you get power windows and mirrors, a keyless entry system, and the ragtop is motor-driven, but there's not much else. The instrument panel (tach, speedo, fuel and temperature gauges) is an attractive white-on-black design that's orange-lit at night. The shift indicator is an obtrusive, vivid green, though.

The rear window on the convertible is glass with a defroster - a far cry from the almost instantly opaque vinyl of my '67 Camaro (sigh...) - but it's only slightly larger than a slivered almond and affords the driver a massive blind spot on the right side. The spoiler sits squarely in the middle of the rearview mirror's field of view, useful for blocking the headlights of the Cherokee behind you, but little else.

One striking difference between the Spyder and its putative competition (Miata, Toyota MR-2) is the presence of a back seat; at least sort of. You can fit a pair of Brittanies into the front bucket seats, but the two Heathers or Nicoles that go into the back had better be the yellteam members that go on the top of the pyramid - there's precious little room for anyone bigger than about 4'-8" back there. The Spyder also has a trunk, big enough for four purses and a duffle bag or two, but I wouldn't count on fitting a suitcase in there. By the way, your Brittany had better start lifting weights if she wants to be able to even get that trunk lid open.


<b>Does What's Inside Count?</b>

The brightest spot in my experience with the Spyder GT was its smooth little 3.0-liter V6 powerplant. This engine is the same that's in the Galant sedan, but shouldn't be confused with the V6s in the Montero and Montero Sport. In the Spyder, the V6 produces a respectable 200 hp, with 205 lb-ft of torque at 4000 rpm. Parents of cheerleaders who are on a limited budget might want to note in advance that the engine is designed to drink <b>premium fuel - a minimum of 91 octane</b>. Fortunately, I got an acceptable 26 MPG in mixed highway/city driving, so the wallet impact is lessened a bit.

The engine's standard companion is a five-speed manual transmission, but mine's being a rental car meant that it was equipped with an automatic tranny. The Spyder's four-speed Sportronic automatic features the option of "sport" shifting. A sort of manual transmission without the clutch; the Sportronic toggles between fully automatic mode and the option of winding out the car and shifting (up and down) at your convenience - simply move the shift selector into the "gates" for sport shift and slap it forward to upshift and backward to downshift. Of course when you come to a stop, the tranny automatically shifts down into first gear - and since the toggle is quite easy to accidentally move in to Sport position, first-time drivers may find themselves inadvertently winding out the engine to redline when leaving a stoplight. The Sportronic allows you, Mitsu says, to shift without having to let up on the accelerator. Sure, but it doesn't always shift right away... When driving in full automatic mode, the transmission hunted annoyingly when I mashed the accelerator, a common complaint with the automatic transmissions Mitsu's parent Daimler-Chrysler uses. If you buy one for her, Heather needs to shift it herself - but if she wants to learn to shift herself, you really should get her the manual transmission...


<b>Is She as Hot as She Looks?</b>

In a word, "No."

For an automotive version of the yell squad captain, the Spyder turned out to be remarkably unsatisfying. Given that it looks hotter than a firecracker, I expected the Spyder to burn down the highway and hug the curves like a lovesick teenager. What I got instead was a gussied up, undersized family sedan. Cornering is marginally better than an everyday ordinary econobox, mainly - I suspect - because of a very low center of gravity, a rather high curb weight, and sticky tires on those big 17-inch wheels. At highway speeds a driver has only a fair connection to the road, and the ride is jittery and jerky. Certainly a sport-tuned suspension has a less forgiving ride, but the Spyder's suspension is lodged in a neither fish-nor-fowl configuration, and gives you an overall unsatisfactory ride. 

Acceleration away from stoplights under full-automatic mode was far less dramatic than I expected - cell-phone wielding soccer moms in Suburbans easily matched me in Houston traffic (although dodging the potholes slowed me down a bit). It's better in Sportronic, but still not as aggressive as one might expect for the horsepower to weight ratio. Times like this I really wish I could take a look at a manual transmission, but, alas... 

The GT and GTS trims (I drove a GT) - the versions of the Spyder that are delivered with the V6 engine - both come with 17-inch alloy wheels. Though undeniably attractive, the size of the wheels forced Mitsu to restrict the turning radius of the car. With that higher-performance engine, the Spyder has a massive 40-foot turning circle (larger than most full-sized pickup trucks). Only with the smaller 2.4-L 4-cylinder engine (and 16-inch wheels) can the Spyder steer through the tightest turns. This is a car that requires two complete lane widths to pull a U-turn, and almost requires that you do that "little-old-lady swing-out" when attempting to enter a narrow parking space. Torque-steering with the front-wheel drive was a bit more pronounced than I would like, as well. 

Overall the handling of the Spyder - acceleration, roadworthiness, cornering, and maneuverability - put a lie to the little car's sporty design. Its disappointing road characteristics feel more like a bigger car, say a Camry, with a sport-suspension package: sportier than a Pontiac Grand Am, for instance, but by no means in the same class as the vehicles it's supposedly competing with. As for two-seaters like the Toyota MR-2, the Mazda Miata, the Honda S2000, or the Porsche Boxster, there is simply no comparison.


<b>A Little Makeup</b>

<i>Safety:</i> Four-wheel disc brakes but no ABS (available for 2002 only as part of a premium package). Dual front seat airbags, but no side airbags (unavailable in any trim). The Spyder has no LATCH tethers for child safety seats. Three-point harnesses in all four seating positions.

<i>Amenities:</i> Power windows, door locks, and mirrors; power-retractable roof (convertible). One front cupholder, none in the rear; one 12-volt power outlet (doubles as cigarette lighter). AM/FM/CD player, available 4-disc in-dash changer. The sound system is adequate or better but not spectacular. Small center console compartment big enough for CD jewel boxes; mid-sized glove box. Small door pockets on front doors; no storage at all in the rear. Trunk space very limited. Not much space for purses and makeup kits, I fear. By the way, there are also no makeup mirrors on the sunvisors. Forgot the market, didn't you, Mitsu?

<i>Comfort:</i> Relatively flat and uncomfortable front bucket seats, tiny rear seats with just about enough foot-, leg-, and shoulder room for a pair of smallish eight-year-olds (again, the top-of-the-pyramid girl might fit).

<i>Build quality:</i> Not impressive. With just about 12K miles, the car had already accumulated a small collection of ticks and creaks. Both doors fit poorly with the body - when closed, the trailing edge of the door projected 1/8 inch or so past the body. The interior was better, but still had some badly fitted plastic. The matte finish on the plate around the shift selector housing was showing a grody looking stain from previous drivers resting their wrists on it.


<b>The Down and Dirty</b>

If you were to give me one of these little guys, I'd most likely sell it and put the money into a Japanese or German 2-seater roadster (Boxster, S2000, MR-2). If I absolutely had to have a sporty car with a back seat, I might be persuaded to check out a Mustang or even a Chrysler Sebring. But there's no way I'd keep one of these things: it's completely unsatisfying as a sporty car and also completely unsatisfying as a sedan. Its major redeeming points are the hot-looking design (even that's debatable in some circles) and the ragtop. But those are more than offset by the Spyder's lackluster performance, mediocre build quality and overall dull handling. 

In short, even when a car is every bit as pleasing to gaze upon as those cheerleaders from high school days, it's <i>always</i> what's inside that counts - and the Spyder might well be the quintessential blonde joke of the automotive world.
