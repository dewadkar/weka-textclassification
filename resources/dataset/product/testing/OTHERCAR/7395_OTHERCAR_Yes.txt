                 I saw the commercial for this car and new I needed to drive it.  I test drove the Mitsubishi Eclipse the same day as the WRX and wow what a difference.  

At First Glance:
     Over all, I love the looks of the car.  The interior is sweet.  Looks couldn't be better on it, in fact, I don't think i'd change much about the way it 'looks', but the placement of things could use a little help.  The cup holder which pops out from the dash is just not a convenient location.  If you want to add another cd to the 6-disk in dash changer (which comes stock) then you can't use the cup-holder, plus, it's small size won't accommodate very large cups.  
     Backseat legroom is basically non-existent.  I am 6'2" and the only way for somebody to come close to being comfortable in the back seat is for me to pull my seat way up.  Yeah, they probably kept the car size a bit small for a reason, but I would have ratherd they take an extra 4" off of the inside of the trunk and given more rear leg room than to give you a virtually useless back seat.  
     The outside of the car took me a minute to adjust to.  The first WRX I saw was Blue Pearl, and I walked out of the dealership thinking that I would never buy a car that ugly, thankfully though I checked around on the internet and saw one in Platinum Silver that looked pretty slick to me, so I gave it another shot.  The silver on this car makes it look sweet.  It's wide stance complimented by it's squared and rounded corners offer a rugged yet sporty look that could make it pass for a regular sedan, if it wasn't for the ram-air that's feeds the intercooler of that turbo-charger you have stashed under the hood, but nobody needs to know about that.  The 5-star allow wheels looks great for stock and the headlight and foglights are pretty intense looking as well,.. basically, I really like the looks of the car.  The rear spoiler I wasn't too sure about, but am sure glad I got it now.  
Driving the Car: The first one that I rode in was an automatic (not by choice, we were going to the dealer's other lot to locate the silver one I was looking for). My salesman was driving the car at first so I got a hint of what the car would do.  Even though it was an auto, he punched it a few times.  The engine is VERY strong, but I wanted to drive the stick.   
     Finally we found the car I was looking for.  I got in and the car only had 4 miles on it.  I couldn't floor it ... I knew that if I bought it, i'd want the engine broken in correctly.  
What I know so far:  Even though I've kept the rpm's below 4,000 ( have to till 1,000 miles ) this thing is fast.  The turbo starts to wind up big at about 2,750 RPM and pulls harder and harder till I have to shift at 4, which really. .. really ... really hurts.  The car handles very well.  It's a very smooth car, very little road noise, no squeaks or rattles, and the car feels extremely sturdy.  It corners quite well, pretty flat cornering but adding some sway bars would probably help it out even more.  Honestly though, I've never managed to make the car loose traction; off the line or in a turn... it sticks to everything.  That All-wheel-drive sure does it's job.  The shift distance is short, which I love.  And you can get an optional 'short throw shift kit' on the car from the manufacturer, but I didn't opt for that.  

I love the car, I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something sporty and fun.  It's not too practical, it requires Supreme Gasoline, which with the prices these days isn't fun to fill up with.  Do yourself the favor, give it a test drive.  You won't be sorry.
