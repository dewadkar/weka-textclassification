            Considering how much this car costs, the '98 Nissan Altima is a great deal. Its comfortable, adequately powerful, maneuverable, and, so far, dependable. Four people can ride easily and 5 for short distances. The only mechanical repair I've had to make is to the thing that shoots the windshield cleaner, and I have a feeling that this is not a common problem. 

A nice feature to this car is the cup holders. In the 97 model, the cup holders extend out from the area underneath the radio and a/c control, which, when utilized with drinks, tend to get in the way. However, in the 98 model, the cup holders are in the area between the two front seats. Convenient to reach and out of the way, the 98 cup holders are a huge improvement.

One negative feature to the Altima is the stereo. I suppose its adequate wherein you can listen to music; however, the sound quality is for from wonderful. Furthermore, sometimes the CDs stick in the CD player and it takes a few hits on the eject button to get them out.

Some other negatives to the Altima is the small number of models with anti-lock breaks, and the choice of colors. I was unable to find a model with anti-lock breaks anywhere in California, and the only colors that don't make we want to puke are white and black.

If you're looking for a mid-sized car in this price range, I would recommend the 98 Altima. Furthermore, if you're choosing between the 97, 98, and 99, model, hands-down, go for the 98. There is no difference between it and the 99, and its larger with improved features over the 97 model.<br><br>
