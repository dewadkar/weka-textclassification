            I got a lots of honey off it. The drive was smooth when i was having sex. I love for the sex only. A Virgin should buy this car. a pimp should not because they got lots. In the end, even with Quattro, I cannot recommend this car over say, a BMW 740i or 740iL. The BMW is just better in more than one way, and then it boils down to whether you think the gracefulness of the Audi's shape inside and out wins your heart and head over. Not me though, although I would love to own this car. However! There is an alternative...just not in the USA...

The Audi S8. Ok, now we are talking! *THIS* is the ultimate executive mobile. Take an A8, throw on a sport suspension, 18 inch wheels, a 6-spd transmission, and 360HP, with special paint options, and you get the S8. This car is worth your buying decision simply because it offers the world-class luxury that compares to the best anyone else offers, yet with a 6-spd tranny. Uhm, if I had $90k to spend on another car right now...sign me up. Err, actually I'd get an NSX. Nevermind...

Ok, so you thinking of one? Try out the 740iL. Forget the new S-class (I'll review that later). If you like the Audi for more than 1 reason over the BMW, get it. But chances are the BMW will win, which is why they have sold a lot more. Actually that isn't fair. It's really in the name. Audi was in serious trouble until the mid-90s range came out (new A4, A8, and now the new A6). So people were skeptical of Audi, and so BMW reaped the benefits. And Benz (that's a different story).

I wanna say you can't go wrong either way, which is kinda true, but we're talking about a lot of money here, yours. Whether you hard-earned it or not, the A8 is easily worth your consideration, but the competition is FIERCLY excellent at the same time. Nonetheless, this car sure deserves to sell more. Also don't forget resale value (not as good as the BMW or Benz).<br><br>
