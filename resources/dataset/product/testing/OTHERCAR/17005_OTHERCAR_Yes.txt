            I bought this car in 2001 when it was a highly hyped new model.  I was impressed with the power and flexibility.  The third row seats were the best available at the time without going to the very large suvs.  The handling is excellent, particularly in wet weather.  There are a few plastic parts that seem a little bit cheap, but this is true of all the competitors as well. Now, on to the point of the review.

After 2+ years we have put nearly 50k miles on this vehicle, including 2 road trips of about 4k miles each. This includes a fair mix of western desert and national park dirt road driving along with a lot of freeway.  Most of the remainder is city driving and weekend day trips.  It has no more squeaks and rattles now than when we bought it. The sure handling has not broken down and there have been no major problems.  The sound system is still working fine as is the navigation system.  So it seems that this model could be a good choice if one is looking for a used suv. 

One gripe is that the windshield glass seems to be susceptible to chipping and cracking.  I have read that the newer models have been improved to use thicker glass so this might not be an issue on newer models. The aftermarket glass seems to be as good as the original Honda glass, so that shouldn't be a worry if you see that.
