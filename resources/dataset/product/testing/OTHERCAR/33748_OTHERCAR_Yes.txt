            I bought this car used from someone at work last year with 78000 km on the clock.  It had been backed into by a large truck at some point in it's life and had a very expensive repair bill (no structural damage but new A/C, hood, rad. etc.) which made it much less valuable at trade in for the previous owner.  I had all the particulars on the damage and knew that it had been repaired properly.  The previous, original owner was an absolute stickler for quality and maintainance so I knew the car had been extremely well looked after and gently used.  I negotiated what I considered (and still do) a good price and haven't been sorry since.  

I love the acceleration, highway ride (it's a bit stiff in town) and interior.  The Bose stereo is amazing, the heated leather seats are relatively comfortable and everything seems to click and work with a quality feel.  The paint seems to be holding up well.  My only gripes are that the car is a bit hard to shift when cold (it's going for a trans. fluid change- we'll see if that helps...), the brakes squeal loudly when first used, especially after being wet, and the car has a few annoying rattles and squeaks.  

The car seems reliable, however, the oxygen sensor and one of the axle boots have been replaced (under a very generous 6-year Nissan warranty which has just expired).  I am interested to see if it remains reliable.  The tires that are on the car were almost new when I bought it, but they are a bit too aggressive- quite loud and tend to hunt somewhat on the highway.  I won't be buying the same when it comes to replacement time.

This is by far the 'nicest' car I have ever owned and not the most expensive either as I have bought two new cars previously that cost more and delivered a lot less (a new 1993 Honda Civic Si (OK), and a new 1996 VW Jetta Trek (piece of junk)).
