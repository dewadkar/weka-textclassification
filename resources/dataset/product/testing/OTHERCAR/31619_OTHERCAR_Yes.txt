            After owning dozens of film cameras, and doing some rather serious research on the digital format, I ended up buying the Nikon CoolPix 800, and am VERY pleased with the performance, and ease of use. Knowing how difficult some electronics can be, I found the 800 was very intuitive in ease of use, and the thing produces some of the nicest photos I've taken in a long time. 
Coupled with some good photo software, and a super quality printer, I've been producing what I think are results comparable to (or even better than) 35 MM film cameras. More importantly, being able to manipulate the images with Photoshop, I've found the same enjoyment in the &quot;digital darkroom&quot; as I have in the regular &quot;wet&quot; darkroom, with the added benefit of being able to work in color. (I've been reluctant to do much color in the wet darkroom, since it is so difficult. 
One reason I chose the Nikon was the fact that it used AA batteries, which are available nearly everywhere. Others use expensive, not commonly available batteries. Of course, I have two sets of rechargeable batteries which I cycle, but always have a set of alkalines at the ready in case I leave myself short on the rechargeable ones.  An additional CompactFlash card for additional shots is also a very logical addition to the system. Highly recommend this camera!<br><br>
