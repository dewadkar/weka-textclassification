            After a poor experience with my first Saturn (1999 SL2), I decided it was time to give it one more go.  The low interest rates at the beginning of the year lured me in, and boy am I thrilled!  I would definitely recommend this car.  It has a very powerful feel to it, especially on inclines and starts from stoplights.  I had been concerned about some engine noises I was hearing, but my mechanic assured me I just wasn't used to such a quiet car - I was just hearing things I wouldn't have heard over ambient noise in the old car!

The '02 model of this car has some definite improvements over the '99.  Since my last one was manufactured, Saturn has done somewhat of a make-over inside and out.  The body looks much sleeker and curvier, with some new lines.  Inside, the dashboard has been redone, presumably to minimize the glare that was such a complaint on the previous model.  Also, Saturn decided to put the horn buttons back in the center column of the steering wheel where they belong!  (The old ones were at about 4:00 and 8:00 and I could never find them when I needed them!)  They have also changed the locations of the cupholders to make them easier to use.

I suppose my biggest complaint is that the rear-view mirror is a bit low, creating an interesting blind spot.  Definitely something I can live with, though.

One specific recommendation - if you plan to have all of your maintenance done at the dealership, ask about the service plan.  I did the math and you can save quite a lot of dough by purchasing this option.
