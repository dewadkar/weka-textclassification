            As a woman this was a surprise case of love at first sight.  I'd been a Jeep fan, had every size over the past 10 years.  This car had more than good looks-after test driving it I was amazed at the comfort-my jeep gave you every bump.  I have a good view of the road, great handling and being a garage sale nut, plenty of room for those treasures.

You have the option of two wheel or four wheel drive, (we have four wheel drive, we're in the North.) You get rear anti-lock brakes, power steering, cruise control, dual airbags, power mirrors and door locks, am/fm cassette and of course, a/c. There is an optional third seat, great for picking up additional kids at school. 

  Being only 5'1&quot; we added the step so I could get in and out easily.  I still tend to slide out to exit and step over the step and make the climb to get in holding the grab bar (a nice feature).  Again, someone must have thought about the shorter people and they put two grab areas that are low enough when you have the rear gate open that at 5' 1&quot; (on  a good day) I can close the gate easily.

We have a 4.7 litre V8 engine and automatic transmission.  We got the heavy duty towing package since my husband uses a trailer a lot.  Its good up to 7,600 lbs.  Watch that tow hitch, it sticks out and can really do a job on your shins. 

 We got the brush bar and the larger size side view mirrors.  The mirrors look great but tend to block my vision (not my husbands -he's very pleased with them).  These were all after market items. Now when we see other Durangos without these options, we laugh and say they're naked Durangos.  Well, it makes us laugh.
 
 My mother-in-law (in her 60's)just bought a Durango and 3 of our good friends got them also. They are all are very satisfied with their new SUVs. Just about every other car in our area is a Durango.  We've had ours almost a year now with no problems. We happily recommend this car to everyone. <br><br>
