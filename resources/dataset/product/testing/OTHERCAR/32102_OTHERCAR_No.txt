            This car is very comfortable. I love being able to sit cross-legged in the front passenger seat (I'm 6'). It's very quiet and with the handling package, taking curves at high speed is great fun. However, I could never actually see the front/back/sides of the car b/c of the high profile. There's a HUGE blind spot over the driver's right shoulder. The autostick feels like nothing more than it is...manually shifting an automatic transmission. The slope of the windshield is such that when driving into the sun, the sun creates a reflection off the dashboard that is very difficult to see through. The leather and wood are nice but the first is a stiff, even with wear it doesn't soften much, and the latter has a plastic feel. The trunk is HUGE but the height of the opening is so small that you're limited to, at most, four large packages to fill the space. Lastly, if you like to drive with your window cracked open for air...don't do it in the rain. On every turn the water runs out of the roof gutters and drops straight on the armrest soaking your arm.  Overall it's a fun car to drive but it doesn't have the solidness of european cars or the economy of japanese cars.
