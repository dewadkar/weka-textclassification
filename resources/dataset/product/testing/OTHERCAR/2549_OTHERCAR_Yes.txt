            Our family really needed a new automobile....and a minivan was something we had agreed upon. The main reason we chose the Pontiac Montana was due to the ability to raise and lower the driver's seat. My hubby is 6'3&quot; and I am 5&quot; 2 1/2&quot; tall. What helped us make the decision was that we could easily raise and lower the drivers seat and make it comfortable for each of us when we drove...and that was the main reason for our buying this particular minivan. 
There are many other things that I love about our minivan. Two things which are VERY IMPORTANT to me are an air conditioner and a stereo system. We live in Southern California where the summers are blistering hot and have enjoyed cool comfort from the air conditioning. The Stereo system sports not only an AM/FM radio but an optional CD player as well which we enjoy. I truly love the way it drives and the comfort of the lumbar seating. The interior is classy, plush and modern which makes me feel like I am driving a car fit for a queen.
What I consider an extra bonus is the &quot;get up and go&quot; we have with the Montana. The 6 cylinder, 4 liter engine has really is great when getting onto the freeway or driving uphill. 
I like the fact that if I am grocery shopping, I can move the back seat(s) up allowing me more space to pack my groceries in place. Since buying our Montana, we have moved and we have piled boxes galore (to the ceiling) without overtaxing the engine. We thought we were just getting a &quot;new van&quot;, yet the  seats have been removed many times allowing us to be able to do hauling for our move or for whatever need arises. We have also put a hitch to the van allowing my husband and I to connect a trailer and haul our ATV on trips plus our new couch and love seat without any problem.
Probably what I hate the most (call this a love/hate deal)is when moving the seats out from the back, you nearly develop a hernia doing the job. The removal of the seats requires someone who is strong or 2 people to get the seats in and out. 
We have only had one problem with our Montana and that was an electrical problem with the turn signals which (miraculously)fixed itself and the dealer/mechanic could not find the problem. Otherwise, except for the usual maintenance that comes with caring for a car, we have had no problems. We have been quite satisfied with our minivan. We recommend it highly!
