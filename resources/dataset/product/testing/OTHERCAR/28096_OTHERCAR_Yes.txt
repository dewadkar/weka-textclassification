            This review will be divided into two roughly equal parts: the camera, and the customer service.

<b>The camera:</b>  Although a new user (especially one used to a traditional camera) might find its vertical configuration a bit strange, the Polaroid Digital Camera (PDC) 700 fits easily into your hand.  Very quickly, you will have forgotten any awkwardness you might have felt.  The vertical shape actually <i>improves</i> one-handed use, leaving your other hand free to gesticulate wildly at the uncooperative subject of your latest photo essay (&quot;No!  Over THERE!  THERE!!  Stupid cat!&quot;).

After mastering the controls, which -- like most cameras -- only takes a few minutes -- you're ready to go.  Not comfortable looking through a tiny view-finder?  Turn on the LCD, and you've got a 1.8-inch monitor to look through.  Don't like that last picture?  Erase any or all pictures from memory on the fly.  Like most high-tech cameras today, it's very user-friendly, and practically does all the work for you.

There's no Zoom function, sadly.  What you see in the view-finder is what you get.  This is really the only complaint I have about the camera... but since the traditional film camera it replaced didn't have a Zoom either, you can't miss what you never had.

The PDC 700 comes with all the software and hardware you need to take pictures, download them to your computer, and edit them to your heart's content, straight out of the box.  Thirty seconds, and you're good to go.  It even comes with batteries (which I previously hadn't seen since 1978 or so).  The memory (4Mb, default) is easily upgradable with a CompactFlash memory card, so you can cram a large number of pictures into memory before download, especially at the lower resolutions.

I won't comment on the price, because I paid about half what the average consumer will.  I bought mine as a refurb, directly from Polaroid.  The refurbishing was a bit of a botched job, though, which brings us to the second half of the review....

<b>Polaroid Customer Support:</b>  The flash didn't work.  Obviously they didn't refurb this as well as they'd thought they had.  They even left the original owner's pictures in memory, which is probably a major no-no.  Nothing racy, though.

Oh well.

So, I contacted Polaroid, got an Return for Service Authorization #, and shipped the camera off for repairs.  Turn around was quick (only 2 days), and then UPS promptly lost the package.  Bye-bye camera.

(Tune in again for my review of UPS.  Grr!)

Here where Polaroid really shone.  Within minutes of finding out that the camera was simply *gone*, they notified me that they'd be replacing it with a brand new one, shipped overnight.  In fact, they said that they'd already <i>shipped</i> the replacement.  I'm not sure I believe that 100%, but I do believe they were right on top of things.

In the past, I've dealt with a lot of companies whose policy was, &quot;UPS lost it; you can fight with them.&quot;  This was a refreshing change of pace.  And, true to their word, the new camera arrived the next business day.<br><br>
