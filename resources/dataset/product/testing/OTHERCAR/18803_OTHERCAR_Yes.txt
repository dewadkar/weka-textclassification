            I've been driving a Jeep Cherokee Sport model for about 2 years now. All-in-all, the experience has been wonderful. No complaints, so far, a I really haven't had any mechanical problems with this baby.

If you like to head to the mountains occasionally, or drive around in the winter, when the ground is covered in a layer of snow, this vehicle will do the trick. 4WD, which can be shifted at high speeds, somewhere around the 50-55 mph range. And, with some new technology of theirs (don't ask me about the mechanics) you can drive in 4WD mode indefinitely, without causing excessive wear (although I have no idea why you would do that for).

My Jeep is a four-door model. I'm not sure if they have always had the option of 2-door. But, the 2000 model does. Either way, the frame of the vehicle has handled beautifully in the rough driving terrain I've been in. And, all with a smooth ride. It is, however, just a little jumpy when taking off. But, then again, that's because I love to just drop my foot on the gas peddle after sitting at a light for a minute.

The interior is roomy, although not as big as the bigger SUV. Still, compact enough, enough space inside, and the frame from side-to-side of the vehicle is pretty thin, with side-view mirrors that can be folded in. This was a plus for me, cause I have a very narrow drive-way. I pop the mirrors in when going up and down the drive-way.

I don't remember if they were options, but of course we also have the ABS brakes and airbags. Luckily, the airbags never inflated on me. I hear those can be expensive to replace.

If you like something smaller, my brother has the Jeep Wrangler. Another nice vehicle by Jeep, equally as satisfying, and more compact.
