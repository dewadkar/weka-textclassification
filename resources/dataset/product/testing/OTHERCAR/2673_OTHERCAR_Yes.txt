            I always thought my next Land Rover would be a Range Rover. I've had a Discovery since 1995.  I traded in my audi A4 Avant to purchase a 2002 Freelander.  

Funny thing is that I bought the Audi as a safe car for mom and the kid to drive around in.  Mom hated it.  It was too hard to put the kid into and take the kid out of the Audi.  The kid hated it.  Her field of view was obstructed.  Although she can barely talk, she always preferred and insisted on taking the Discovery over the Audi.  She actually learned to say "truck" - meaning take the Discovery instead of the Audi - before many other words.  

I was baited by an end of year advertisement offering the Freelander financing for 60 months at 0%.  I ended up getting $2,875 dollars off of the sticker price ($29,875), 4.9% financing, rubber floor mats, wheel locks, and an arm rest.   

The Freelander feels a lot like my Discovery (at least the 1996 model year).  The interior buttons are located in the same places.  One nice thing is that the electric window controls are intuitive ie the buttons in the front control the front windows, the buttons in the back control the back windows.  Even after 7 years, my Discovery still confuses me.  UNLIKE my Discovery, the steering as well as the way it handles the road is a lot like my ex-Audi.  I was very happy with this.  

Another nice thing is that the Freelander is less than 6 feet tall.  The Discovery doesn't fit in half of the parking garages in town.  

The heated seats have only an on/off feature.  Most other European autos have a range of seat heats from low to high.

The headlights are simply headlights.  Just like my Discovery.  Didn't realize how bright those Xeonon, self leveling Audi headlights actually were until I drove the same roads with the Freelander.  Nothing exceptional here.  

I don't have the HK sound system.  The standard sound system, is similar to my Discovery's, and is nothing great.  Given that I've had the Discovery for 7 years, I would have expected a few improvements in the sound system.  All the Freelander has is a single CD.  

The arm rest is absolutely essential.  It is available in the '03 model.  You've got to pay for it in the '02 model.  As you saw, I got it included in my  deal.  

One thing that I want to point out is driver visibility.  Visibility is excellent on the left and front.  On the right, when looking over the shoulder, a significant portion of the line of sight is blocked by the rear seat's head rest.  In the back, when looking over the right shoulder, a significant portion of the line of sight is blocked by the right and center seat head rests as well as the spare tire and brake light.  

A weird feature is that the key is required to open the gas cap.  The whole gas cap comes off with the key.  I've lost a few gas caps in the past so this is actually a good feature for me.  But for others, this may be a negative.  

The front window has a heating element embedded into it in a very small, 1/8th inch square pattern.  Just like a rear window defogger, the front window can be de-fogged.  While driving at night, the heating element causes incoming light from on coming traffic to have a non-typical diffusion pattern.  I'm still not used to it.  

I was also shocked when I went to turn on the rear and front window de-foggers and the plastic console actually flexed.  Very "cheap", poor quality construction.  

Additional "cheap", poor quality construction elements include a rattle when the rear door is closed, weak detents when the front door's are opened (this is identical to my Discovery).  Please keep in mind that aside from the high end Range Rover, I actually expect these types of issues with any Land Rover product and I just bought my second Land Rover.  

The extended warranty from Land Rover is $1,995 - 6 years or 72,000 miles.  I declined to purchase the warranty as I think after 3 to 3 1/2 years, I'll be able to buy a warranty for about the same price.  Just plug in the numbers using a '99 Discovery on Yahoo or MSN - warrantybynet.com to see.   I also declined to purchase the special paint treatment for $995.  If I was going to spend a thousand dollars, it was going to be on something other than paint.  

I still really like the Freelander.  My primary purpose was getting my 2 year old daughter into and out of the car seat without breaking my back or banging her head.  The Freelander is heigh enough for me, at 6 feet tall, and her at 30 lbs, to do this without negatively torquing and contorting my middle aged somewhat out of shape body. Performing this function in the Freelander is better than any car (I considered Volvo V70 Cross Country, S60, and Audi All Road) and the same as any SUV.   

I didn't look at any other comparable SUVs like the CRV.  I did look at getting another Discovery or the Volvo XC90.  But that would have been another $10-$15K.  

I hope this information helps you in your assessment of the Freelander.  Maybe my next one will be a Range Rover.  

Best Regards,

Joe
