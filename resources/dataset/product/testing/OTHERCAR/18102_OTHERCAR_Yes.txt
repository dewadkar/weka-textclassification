            I love this car.  First of all, I was extremely lucky that I got it.  We got a really good deal on it, and of course I couldn't turn it down.  And I haven't regretted it at all.  I really needed a new car because my old car was about to die, and this one filled my needs perfectly.

My car is white and a 4 door.  It is also a 1996, although I admit I love the new ones and would love to buy one.  But that's probably something for the future.  I love having a 4 door just because it is easily accessible for everyone that way.

We did have a problem shortly after we got it, and it is something I have heard is pretty typical of Neons.  I had a cracked head gasket.  Luckily it was still under warranty, so I didn't have to pay for it.  But I would recommend if you are seriously looking at buying this car, to get it checked out or get an extended warranty, because this could be pretty costly.

All in all though, I love my car.  This is the only problem I have had with it.  I would have to say that it is not a family car, because it is rather small, and the trunk is tiny.  But it serves my fiancee and my needs just fine.<br><br>
