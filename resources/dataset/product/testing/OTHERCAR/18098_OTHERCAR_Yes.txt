            My car is a 1996 Dodge Neon Highline sedan.  I have been the only owner of it, and have had no problems whatsoever with it.  It's fun to drive, especially with 130 hp, people are always suprised by it, (maybe expecting a bad Civic or something?)  

It gets excellent gas mileage, from about 23 mpg, stop and go, to between 45-55 mpg on the highway.  It's very cute, and the speakers are great.  

I don't like that the windows are frameless (takes about 2 minutes to break into with a hanger....I guess that's useful when you lock your keys in your car), and some people complain that the backs of the back seats are flat.  I've heard from one Neon owner (who decided, at a gas station, to tell me that she felt sorry for me) that hers had blown four head gaskets in five years, and that that was a common Neon problem.  I have never had this problem, or any other, and I have 85,000 miles on my car.  I could be just lucky, or it could be that I take care of my car.  

For a small car, the leg room is pretty good, no one has complained yet, even in the back seat with the two front seats pushed back.  Overall, it was a great value for the money.  I had originally liked the Civic, but after owning this car, I believe this was the best choice.<br><br>
