            This is a truly fun car to drive. It handles beautifully and feels secure on curves and in wet driving conditions. Its 4 cylinders (with manual transmission) provide an incredible amount of power. And it doesn't hurt that it's a real eye-catcher.....not just another cookie-cutter automobile. I've had this car for 4 years, and I still feel a rush of satisfaction every time I walk up to it and get in! 

It's also been extremely reliable. I have 70,000+ miles on it, and have had absolutely no problems. While the manual suggests premium grade fuel, I use mid-grade without any drop in performance.

On the down side, the ride is pretty rough and you don't exactly glide over every bump and pot hole... although I understand that this is pretty standard for a sports-type car. Also, visibility is poor on the passenger side, and the rear window doesn't exactly allow for a sweeping view either. Backing out of a parking lot space is something that has to be done REAL slowly and carefully. 

Yes, the back seat is pathetic...but this is something to be expected in a sports car.  Actually, if the driver and/or the front seat passenger need minimal leg room, the back seats are comfortable and provide reasonable leg room for short trips.

Another down side is the cost of the tires (I had to pay $160 for EACH tire), but I guess that's to be expected when you have a sports car with high performance tires.
