            This is a review on the 9000 CS, the least expensive of the three 9000 models offered in 1996.  I purchased this car as a replacement for my commuter car, a 1997 Saturn SL2.  My oldest boy, who is almost four years old, was complaining that the back seat of my Saturn was too small.  I went out searching for a larger car so that my family could fit better.  I wanted to purchase a car that didn't look like everyone else's car on the road.  Saabs have been known to have a distinctive look yet handle well and are durable.  This car does not disappoint!  This car handles extremely well with a very compliant ride.  I expected it to handle well since it was equipped with Z rated 205-55R 16 tires.  What I didn't expect was a very smooth and compliant ride even when going over train tracks.  This car has a similar road feel to German cars that I have owned (Mercedes). The car is similar in length to a Mercedes Benz 300E but has three inches more knee room, two inches more hip room and over one inch in headroom to the Mercedes.  Because of the light pressure turbo (LPT) engine in my car, I actually can accelerate as quick or quicker than the 300E.  Amazing when you compare that the Saab has a 2.3 liter, 4-cylinder, 16 valve, turbo-charged, inter-cooled engine vs. the Mercedes 3.0 liter straight six that puts out 170 vs. 177 hp respectively.  The Saab is almost 200 lbs. lighter than the Mercedes.

The LPT has no turbo lag when compared to its full turbo Saab counterparts.  This LPT engine seems to give all the torque you need even when the engine is at 1500 rpms.  No problems merging with or passing traffic on the freeway.  The interior space, especially the rear seats, are similar in size to a Ford Taurus.  What this car excels in is it's trunk space.  The trunk is 23.5 cubic feet vs. the Ford at 18, the Mercedes at 15 or the Saturn at 12.  Almost double my Saturn!  Also, the rear seats in the Saab fold down in a 40/60/100 configuration, which means even more hauling space up to 56.5 cubic feet.  

In the driver's seat, all controls are within easy reach.  This car is almost fully equipped except for power seats and a moonroof.  The manual controls for the front seats are easy to use and have infinite settings including lumbar support.  This car has many storage bins except one, a glove box, but it does have a locking center console storage bin.  There are several nice features that also come standard with the Saab.  A pair of front fog lights with one fog light on the rear trunk for safety.  Side backup lights so that you can see what is next to you at night when you back into reverse.  A comprehensive computer display that tells you the outside temperature, miles to empty for the gas tank with an average and immediate mpg used.  An eight speaker Clarion audio system, with EQ, also wired for a CD changer in the trunk.  Last, but not least, even headlight wipers.  

Reading the different reviews by the car magazines about the seats in this car are true.  They are some of the most comfortable I have ever used.  Driving at freeway speeds, this car is very quiet at approximately 68 dB.  It feels like a substantial car that begs to be tossed around.  Little body roll on turns with a responsive rack and pinion steering system.  Again, the LPT engine gives this car great acceleration.  If that is not enough, there are several aftermarket facilities that can tweak the engine and suspension much further.  Gas mileage for such a performance car is great.  Upper 20's on the freeway with low 20's in the city.  Unlike the Mercedes which uses premium unleaded, this car uses regular unleaded.  The only negative to this car is the lack of dealership support in my area.  There aren't too many around to do the warranty work.  But the work they do is superb.  If you are looking for a performance car that can really take your family, this is it.  It can easily compete with the BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class of its time.  Back to my son.  What does he think about it the car?  He said, "Dad, I really love the car.  My feet feel better."  I agree. 

Summary:

Pros-
Ride
Handling
Passenger Space
Trunk Space
Safety Features

Cons-
Lack of dealer support.  There are only eight in the whole San Francisco Bay Area.
