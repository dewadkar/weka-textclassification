            We bought our camera a little less than a year ago.  I had been doing auctions online and needed a way to put pictures on my auctions.  But we needed something inexpensive.  We looked at a lot of cameras and everything was out of our range.  Then the day after Thanksgiving (1998), one of the stores (not sure if I am allowed to tell which one, so I won't) was offering this camera during their 4 hours early bird sale for only $90. WOW!!! We hadn't found anything under $150 to this point.  Well, I went over to ask questions and was informed that they had already sold out, but we could be put on a waiting list, which I did.  About 2 months later, the camera came in and we bought it.

When we first took it home, I thought I was going to be disappointed in it, my husband could do just about anything he wanted with one of the pictures, which made me think that it was going to be too technical for me.  He could enlarge or shrink a picture, make a spiral effect, distort the picture in just about anyway imaginable, cut, paste, clip, change, paint, edit, type  etc. etc.  Seemed too complicated to me.  So the first several times I used the camera, I asked for his assistance.  I hadn't yet actually loaded a picture into an auction, I was still trying to figure out how to take a picture and just get it to show up on the computer.

Well, after a while, I decided if I was going to do this, I needed to learn how to do it right.  I sat down with the booklet and read the instructions, trying out each little feature as I went.  Before long, I not only was loading pictures into email, but easily attaching them to my auctions as well.

One of the features I like so much about a digital camera (any brand), is that you can see your pictures immediately and decide whether you want to keep them or not.  This camera holds 64 pictures, (I think, I've never actually filled it up completely).  It's easy to download into the software, and easy to use the pictures after they are loaded to the computer.  It does eat up the batteries, but I think they all do that.  I keep mine attached to the computer, so plugging it into an outlet is not a big deal for me.

You can delete all the pictures with a press of a button, or delete pictures one at a time if you're not ready to dispose of them all at the same time.

The quality of the pictures is GREAT, I'm very pleased with how they come out and how easy they are to take.  My kids can easily take a top quality picture with this camera.  You can use the built in flash or select to &quot;not use it&quot;, I have found that each situation is individual and generally requires me to try it both ways to determine which picture is best.  I take a lot of pictures of books, which often leaves a glare, but I can easily adjust my flash features and tilt the book to the right angle to get a good picture.

The camera came with instructions, software, all the appropriate cables and a nice cover.

This is the only digital camera we have ever owned, so I can't compare it to other cameras.  I guess this is the least technical in the Polaroid line, but don't let that stop you from purchasing it.  There are still a lot of things I need to learn about the camera and the software, but it has fit my needs for nearly a year and I don't plan on replacing it anytime soon.  I feel like we definitely got our money's worth, especially since it was an early bird special.

With most things, you get what you pay for.  With this one, I think you get a little more.<br><br>
