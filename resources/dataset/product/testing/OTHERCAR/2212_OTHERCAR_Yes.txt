            What led me into buying the Prelude was its unique styling. (And its headlights). I wanted to buy a unique car which didn�t look like all the rest. I looked at the Toyota Celica, the Nissan Silvia, Hyundai Coupe and of course, the Prelude. The Celica was nice but the seats were slightly uncomfortable. The Silvia was all right but had limited leg and headroom. The Hyundai Coupe looked good but had bad gear change and felt like I was driving a coke can. The Prelude outstood them all with its sharp look and cool headlights. Headroom isn�t the best but it doesn�t bother me. I finally settled with the Prelude and I bought it. 

It�s very different than its predecessor in many ways. Sharp lines replace the smooth curves, controls are easier to reach and operate on the dash and there is more interior space. (Though it�s not spacious). The older model is very attractive but the new Prelude catches the eye as it drives by.

The 5th generation Prelude�s styling is based on the lines of the 3rd generation Prelude to give it a firm, crisp look. It looks bland in a light colour such as white, light grey and other light colours but nothing beats it when it is in black.

I think this car would appeal more to young buyers looking for a sporty coupe type car or businessmen and women. (Especially in leather). 

The Prelude handles beautifully on rough roads and has good suspension. The ride is comfortable but the seats lack support in the bottom. The rear seat is very cramped but I�ve never used them.

Honda plans to discontinue the Prelude by the end of this year. This is a pity because the Prelude has been a comfortable, reliable car since the 1970�s.

If anyone is interested in buying a brand new Honda Prelude, you better hurry up and decide because there will be no such thing as a brand new Prelude next year.
