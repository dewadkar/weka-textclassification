            I bought this vehicle as a replacement to my Plymouth Acclaim when it died. The Protege has been an excellent car for commuting to and from work. It also gets awesome gas mileage (I average about 32 MPG) compared to my Acclaim's 24 MPG. The Protege has excellent handling and can &quot;turn on a dime&quot;. My only complaint is the rear of the car is not properly weighed down, so there is a greater risk of fishtailing. The dashboard is well...foreign in design and placement of controls. I was concerned about the hazard-light control right in the center of the dashboard. This made me wonder if it is a frequently used item. Fortunately I learned it is another weird Japanese control placement that is also noticeable in Hyundai's line of vehicles. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this car to a person who doesn't need a whole lot, just some wheels to take them wherever they want to go.<br><br>
