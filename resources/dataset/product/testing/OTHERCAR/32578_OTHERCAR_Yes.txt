                As a 21 year old college student I need a car that gets the job done. Looks, style and elagance mean nothing to me. I want to hop into my car , turn the key and get to where I need to be. My 1997 Saturn is defenetly up to the task and in the looks and style department it isn't desperatly lacking either.
    After beating 40,000 miles onto the car I have not come across any major problems yet. Just the expected brake change and oil change.No other major fix-it ups have drained my wallet dry.
    Highly reccomded for people looking to get the most out of their buck.I'll keep you all informed when and if I hit 100,000 miles!<br><br>
