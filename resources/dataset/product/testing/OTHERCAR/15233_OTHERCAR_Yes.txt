            I bought my 1997 Acura Integra GS-R because I needed a reliable, practical, and sporty looking vehicle that can get me here and there, and to my UC and to my parent's house on the holidays. I didn't really drive my GS-R a lot because I am usually studying at UCSB with no time to have fun. That is what makes driving this car so fun.I love many things about this car. It has multi-personality. From about 1100-5100 rpms, it drives like a Honda Civic with a bit more kick into it. And from about 5150-8100 (Redline), the DOHC and VTEC begins to kick in. This is when the engine gets kind of loud. The rooming in the trunk and the back seats seem more like a Honda Accord sedan. And my leathered out seats make it very luxurious.<br>But there are a few flaws about this vehicle. The fact that there are so many of these on the road, is kind of annoying. Another thing that I do not like about this car is that this style/design of 3rd generation Integra has been with us for about 6 years. I do not really like the fact that Acura has not changed the design of this car for 6 years. But there are more things to love about it, than to hate about it.<br>I love this car because it performs great at high and low rpms. This car was the perfect one for me. And I have no serious regrets. It has better gas mileage than that of a car u think. It gets about 25-31 and above MPG. Therefore, I do not have to bum any gas money from my room-mate I recommend this car to a person who is looking for a sporty/practical/low-profile car should seriously look into buying this type of car. If not, and you would like a luxury-sporty/practical/low-profile car, I suggest looking into buying the Integra 4-door Sedan.<br>  <br><br><br>
