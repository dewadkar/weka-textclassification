            Since Picking up my Freelander XEi 1.8 `Hard Top from the dealer in September 1999 I have had the following problems. I suppose they have been pretty minor and were soon fixed up by the Service Department. 

The Rear Window would not return to the closed position using the key, but worked whilst using the switch on the dashboard, this happened during our pre-delivery inspection, so 5 minutes after taking delivery of a shiny brand new Freelander I found myself sitting in the Service reception area. The Air conditioner overflow hose fell off, so any excess water soaked into the carpet instead of running out onto the road. A Cassette tape that I was playing jammed, It was not possible to switch the radio off and the unit got very hot. Removing the fuse had no affect as the unit still received power, all I could do was drive home and disconnect the battery overnight. According to the manual there is a fuse in the main fuse box under the dashboard but removing this had no effect as there was still power getting to the unit. Both the driver and passenger windows Vibrated. On opening the rear door, the handle snapped and came away completely from the door frame. A complete new handle had to be fitted. Offside Headlamp Housing loose, due to a missing bolt? Brakes Squeal when Cold
