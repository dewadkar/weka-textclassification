            Every 16 year old needs a first car, and this 16 year old got a '97 Nissan Sentra. I absolutely <b>love</b> my car! Here's just a sample of the awesome features...

Good gas mileage. I've been driving all over town and only had to fill her up once. No worries about running out of gas way out here in the country!

Can actually get up the mountain. Big plus.

Not too big to fit in the garage, not too small to be road splatter.

Smooth ride, perfect for cruising or commuting.

An all around fun car to drive. I'll go the long way (the scenic route) just for the pleasure of driving the car.

I recommend the Nissan Sentra, new or used, to anyone, especially those getting their first car. It's a good one.<br><br>
