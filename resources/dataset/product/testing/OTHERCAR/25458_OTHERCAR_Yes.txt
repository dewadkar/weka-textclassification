            We bought this car cause our old one died, completely and utterly died. All we wanted was something with A/C and that worked pretty well. We were desperate. My mom and I had settled on the fact that we would have to buy a used car. Probably one with high mileage that would hopefully work for a few more years. We got so much more than that!

We were told by other dealers that they would try and get us approved for a used car "but it would take some time" cause our credit wasn't great. Then we went to Saturn where the used car people said sure no problem, why not look at a new car. So we did. A week or so later we left with an SL2, not just an SL. We added special wheels, upgraded the radio, and got automatic locks.

I love this car. My mom drives it now cause I have my own Saturn, but I drove hers for 6 months. The SL has a nice sized backseat, much bigger than the SC class. The trunk is large too. The AC cools the car off quickly even in Houston's summer heat. I've noticed it is a quiet ride compared to other cars where you don't always realize you are going that fast cause you can't hear the road. It does fine over bumps especially killer railroad tracks. We've never had a problem with gas mileage either.

When we bought the car we were told exactly how much each 3,000 mile tune-up would cost and so far haven't had any extra costs. They even wash and vacuum it for you. My mom has had this car for a few years now and really loves it. So far nothing has needed repair except the tires. I recommend this car to families. It's a practical car and you can add perks to your liking. They are very affordable. I definitely recommend it to people who hate the typical car salesman attitude of "such a deal we have for you today" cause you won't get that at Saturn. The people are so nice they say remember you from the last time you were in and really care.
