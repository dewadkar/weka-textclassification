            The only thing I didn't like was the 17mpg highway 14city - but I knew about that before I bought it.  The reason I write is to tell you about the accident I was in.  I was going 40 mph through an intersection on I-95 in Maine,  a car tried to jump the light from the right enterence to the intersection causing me to swerve hard to the left.  To avoid on coming traffic, I had to jerk the rig back to the right (taking out the median sign in the process).  The truck went into a slide and hit the 12 in cement curb which flipped the truck completely airborn landing on the roof.  2 things kept this from being my last ride ever:  1) the seat belts held, I was literally hanging upside down when the 100ft roof skid stopped, and more importantly 2) the drivers side door frame and roof bent but did not cave in.  The paramedics said both these acts absolutely saved my life.   I have yet to get another SUV, but have recommended the Rodeo and Passport to my friends based on the strength of the frame. <br><br>
