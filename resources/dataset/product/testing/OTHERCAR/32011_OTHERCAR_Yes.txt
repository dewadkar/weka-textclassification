            I bought my ES300 in 1997 (the 1st year they were redesigned) through Auto-by-Tel (which offered a terrific deal through Serramonte Lexus).  I've had the car for over 2 years now and it's been a real pleasure to drive.

My parents bought a top-end Camry last year and I can honestly say these 2 cars drive nothing alike, even though they share the same chassis.  The ES300 is much smoother, quieter (I heard they use thicker glass for the windows), more powerful, and certainly more luxurious.  The low-$30's is a reasonable negotiated price point (before taxes and fees) and I think it offers a terrific deal.  

On top of that, I heard the prices on the newest, latest ES300's are even less than what I paid back 2 years ago, even with the additions of new enhancements like variable-valve-timing engines, side air-bags, ignition kill anti-theft systems, more wood paneling, etc. 

I highly recommend the car, and the Lexus service is even better than I had heard about.  I've never second-guessed myself on getting the ES300 and would recommend it without reservation.  <br><br>
