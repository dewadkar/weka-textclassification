            My family has a 1999 Altima GLE.  This car was a replacement for a 1990 Camry, and boy was it a step up.  The one we purchased was a GLE, luxury model.  Since the car is primarily my mother's, I hadn't driven it much until the last few weeks when it was lent to me.  In my two weeks of being its primary driver, I really got a feel for how it handles.  
Road trips:
I took this car on many road trips while visiting ranging from 3 hours long distance highway driving to over 5 hours of travel most of which was sitting in traffic down near Key West.  The car rides very smooth, although there is some a bit more cabin noise than I had expected as I neared 70 mph.  The car has great pick up and I was pleasantly surprised at the ability of the automatic to downshift to provide power at high speeds to pass cars.  The seats were comfortable and I didn't have any back or leg aches after driving all day like I normally would have in the older Camry.  However, I did have some shoulder pain at the end of the second day which I blamed on how low the right arm rest is.  Since it is low, I had a tendency to hang my arm on the wheel a bit.  Overall, I would say this car was great for road trips except for one minor pet peeve I had with it:  the sun visor.  I can't believe that Nissan put all that into luxury but couldn't make the visor just a tad longer or add an extender to block sunlight from the side.  Yes, it does swing over, but it seemed to me that the visor was pretty short and this did annoy me during the trip (but, hey, I was in Florida, maybe it wouldn't be so bad somewhere else).  Cruise control was great but not easy to figure out.  We actually had to pull out the book and read.  Once we figured it out, it was handy.  I especially liked the resume acceleration option which would bring you back to speed after waiting for someone to get out of your way.
In town driving:
I putt-putted around the Fort Myers area in this car for a few weeks too.  it did well in the &quot;snow bird&quot; traffic and was easy to maneuver close to toll booths.  I really liked the leather seats and how high they were, it made getting in and out of the car a breeze.  The interior of the car is well designed, very accommodating for short and tall folk.  As a shorter person, some things such as the radio volume seemed out of reach but I guess if it was a big deal there is probably a 'on steering' option.  The airconditioning worked well, although with the humidity in Florida, this car seemed to like to fog up a lot.  I don't know if there is some residue on the windshield or what but it was a pain a few nights out.  Speaking of windshield, it was nice but this car needed better wiper blades.  I think they put the dirt cheap ones on at the factory, go buy new ones ASAP!  My Neon blades work much better.  That's one of those cheap to fix but annoying that they didn't fix it things.
In summary, I really enjoyed the car except for a few minor things.  Overall, I would rate the car highly for trips and in town driving but if I purchased one, I would make the small investments to fix up the minor stuff.
