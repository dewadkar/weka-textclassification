            My dad bought me a 1992 Honda Prelude for a graduation gift in 1996. I loved the looks of the car from the start, but once we drove it, we knew it was the perfect car! Not only does it look great, it performed excellently. I never had to replace anything on the car and I never had any problems with anything. That is really saying something since it had 100,000 miles when we bought the car. In three short years I put 40,000 miles on it and only had to buy gas and oil changes! 

The reason I had to sell it, brings me to who shouldn't own the car. I was pregnant and had to get a larger vehicle in order to accomodate a car seat and all the things that go with a child. So, for the most part, the car isn't too great for families or people that travel with a large amount of things. There is little trunk room or backseat room, which should be expected with a sports car. Really that is the only thing I hated about the car, and because there were so many things I loved about it, I thought it was worth it. I HATED to sell the car! I was very upset about the idea of having to trust another vehicle. I was right to be leary because my Toyota Previa van hasn't lived up to the Honda. Now I have to see the car sitting in my neighbor's drive since he is the one who I sold it to! Everytime I see it, I wish I could drive it again.<br><br>
