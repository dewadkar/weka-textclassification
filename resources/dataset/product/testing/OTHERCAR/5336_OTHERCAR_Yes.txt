            We bought our Plymouth Grand Voyager in 1998 and it has thus far been a pretty good vehicle.  It certainly has all the room we need, plus some, and doesn't look as boxy as most minivans do.  

It has had some mechanical problems,  but all have been with the air conditioning.  It won't cool, it won't blow, and one time it went up in flames.  Not really what a woman with three small kids in tow needs to have to deal with.   I think the majority of our problems with this ac system have been because of the dealer doing the repair work, because its under warrenty and they can't charge the high prices,  they have seemed to use the cheap parts and quick fixes on it.  The last time it went in,  it went to the Plymouth dealer and the whole system was replaced top to bottom.  We've had no troubles with it since.  

Our van does have the dual sliding doors,  which are something I wouldn't do without.  They make it very easy to get the kids in and out of carseats.   The roominess of it is great,  plenty of room for kids and three carseats plus all their &quot;stuff&quot; as well as groceries and packages.  
One thing it does not have is the rear ac,  that is one thing I overlooked when we got it,  and have been sorry for.  When we do trade this on in,  the next one will definately have that.  

We've taken this van on many road trips, and its always been a good comfortable ride.  I would buy another just like it with a few changes,  but as far as the van configuration itself,  it is a good one. <br><br>
