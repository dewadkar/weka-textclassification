            I usually read other reviews of a product before purchasing it, but in the case of the Fuji F420, I was one of the first to purchase it on my trip to Hong Kong. 

I spent an hour in the store taking photos with the Fuji and comparing it to the Canon Powershot S400. The Fuji reproduced green colours very well, and had a superb redeye reduction flash.

The casing is all metal and very stylish. The video mode is extremely smooth, with 30 frames per second. Menus are very simple to navigate and the included software seems good although I havent used it much.

Battery life out of the included Ni-Mh pack is good - last night I went through 70 photos and 3 minutes of videos without any low battery warning. You can use 2 x AAA batteries as well, but I tried using Alkaline batteries and they only lasted for 30 snap shots.

There are a couple of drawbacks though:
1) The camera hasn't been released in Europe/America as yet and I can't download an English manual. The printed manual was in Japanese and so I have to wait till I can download the English version

2) XD memory cards are the most expensive. They may be small/fast/power efficient, but they are still 30-40% more expensiv than other cards.

3) Lag time between/during photos is terrible. There is meant to be a fast shutter mode but I havent figured it out yet. Last night there was a full second delay between pressing the button and the image that appeared. Then there was a 5 second delay while it saved the image !
