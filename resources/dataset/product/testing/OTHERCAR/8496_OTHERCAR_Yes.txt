            This little neato thing was given as a late birthday/early christmas gift from my boyfriend, so I think its just about the nicest gift anyone has ever bestowed upon me. I just took a nice set of christmas photos of downtown, and I found it really easy to use the camera, you just point and click, then if you want to see the image before you upload it onto the computer you can see it in your LCD display. 

Several things I like about my nice camera - its got a lot of personal value to me, coming from my boyfriend. He got it with a case, and another smartcard with 32mb but still have the original 16mb the camera came with. It seems a little tricky to use when it comes to the menu options, but since I have only had it for a few days, and all I know how to use is the Erase, so I can make many more pictures! 

The one issue I have with it (and the ONLY one), is that someone with a big nose might make noseprints on the LCD if they are looking in through the viewfinder. It doesn't seem practical, but I don't mind. I have a cloth to clean my LCD if I see fingerprints or noseprints on my screen. Would make more sense to put the viewfinder splat dab in the middle of the camera, but I can't complain now. One tiny other issue is that the image does not come out quite well on the LCD in bright light. I've solved that - just get out of the light! =) 

If you want to see my newest pictures I did with my FujiFilm Fine Pix Camera you go to page 2 of my webshots at http://community.webshots.com/user/rainbowtwix/ and click on Christmas in Honolulu, Hawaii. (yep, thats where I am!) 

Aloha and thank you for looking at my epinion!
