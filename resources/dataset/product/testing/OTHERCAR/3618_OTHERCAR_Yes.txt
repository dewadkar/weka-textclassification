            Let me first start off by saying that I was the owner of a 1998 Grand Am GT, that served me well mechanically for 70,000 miles.  When I got that car, I was 24, fresh out of college, and single.  The 2-door was fine for then.  Soooo, let's fast-forward 3 years.  Now married, the 2-door was getting to be a pain.  So, I pondered, how can I get the looks and sportiness without sacrificing a mortgage or my firstborn???

Enter the Grand Prix...

The Car
----------------------------------------------------------
1999 Grand Prix GTP, bronze exterior, tan interior.
17,100 well-cared-for miles. A perfect match???

Interior
----------------------------------------------------------
The car is loaded, only option not on the car was the trunk-mounted CD-changer (but, I share an opinion that Delco=Crap).  The car even has heated seats, which could come in handy in those freezing Texas winters... yes, sarcasm lives on.

I am pleased with the overall feel of the ergonomics, but I wish that Pontiac would have angled the audio and climate controls more towards the driver and sacrificed the "dual climate control" which really makes no sense in this size car.  One other gripe is the typical-GM "one lever holds everything" approach on the left side of the steering wheel.

The "heads-up" display is an interesting feature I have played with at some length.  Although it is a neat techno-gadget, I got to the point where I believed it was too distracting for my taste and turned it off.  The information console on the center dash is a nice touch, even including a boost meter (also known as "gas guzzle" meter) to monitor how much boost the supercharger is providing.

The seats are very nice, with great lumbar support, especially in the lower areas of my already beaten back.  The power adjustment is good, and the seat can be pushed WAY back to accommodate taller drivers (I myself am 6'4").

The moonroof somewhat gets in the way of my hair, but I usually slide the cover back to allow about 1 1/2" more headroom.  The moonroof itself is not a wind-tunnel like most.

Engine and Ride
-----------------------------------------------------------
Here is where she really shines... 240 horses pushed by a 3.8 liter V6 with a Roots-type supercharger.  One thing that really impresses me is the mid-range punch I get when I need to exit quickly, going from 45 to 60 miles an hour.  I am always worried about passing power, but the Pontiac eases my worries.  No lag, my friend... she will get me there quickly.  Off the line, it is very quick for a heavy car, although most Camaros and Stangs will still smile as you fade into the mirror (but, at my maturing age, I guess I shouldn't care).  The car runs very cool, never getting up into the higher temperature ranges unlike my previous Pontiac.

The oil dipstick, power steering fluid dipstick, and coolant overflow tank are all very easy to get to.  I have had no problems checking anything so far.  Only thing that worries me is when I need to change the spark plugs or oil the supercharger.

The GTP does have a stiffer suspension, and it does show on rougher roads.  But, if you are cruising the interstates or nicer highways, you should not notice any difference between it and the next-down GT.  Smooth as glass otherwise.

Overall
----------------------------------------------------------

I am pleased so far with my purchase.  The car has plenty of power, four doors, and those neat commercials with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.  I can still have my macho car while hauling my future kiddos around...

Some alternatives in the same class would be the Buick Regal (built on the same chassis), and the Ford Taurus (not quite the power, but does have the goodies otherwise).
