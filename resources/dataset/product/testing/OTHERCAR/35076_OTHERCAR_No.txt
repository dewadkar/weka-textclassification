            I am an enlisted soldier in the Army and don't really have much money to spare on vehicle repairs.  I was led to believe that the Caravan was one of the most reliable vehicles on the road.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  

Since my family has been driving this van, we've experienced just about every problem that is listed on various sites around the web.  First was the brake rotors, which failed due to a faulty proportioning valve.  This has happened twice.  

Then the bolt securing the hatch strut sheared off and the hatch fell on me.  Fortunately, it didn't really cause me injury.  

The next thing was the transmission.  That was the biggest and most expensive.  Unfortunately, we were unaware that this was a common problem and that Chrysler is aware of it.  To the extent that the dealerships keep a few spare transmissions around to put in dying Caravans.  The thing is, they will replace the transmission for free, even after the warranty has expired, IF you know about the design problem and bring it to their attention.  In other words, they won't replace it for free, unless you know that this is a wide-spread problem.  

Our top layer of paint is peeling off, a little every day, exposing the gray primer underneath.  

Now, we are having problems with the head gasket, and I suspect that I will have to replace the transmission again, because it has begun to make the same old noises and has begun to shudder when it changes gears.  Anyone looking at a used Caravan should look somewhere else.  The price listed on the van is only the tip of the ice-berg.<br><br>
