            I did a lot of homework before I even went to the dealerships. We needed a second car for my wife and I didn't want to buy something like Corolla or Civic. We could afford more expensive cars and I gave a shot to BMW 325i and Mercedes-Benz C240. After testing Galant ES V6 I had no doubts left - it was a clear winner. While BMW 3-series could somewhat standout in terms of handling and performance at double price of Galant, MB was obvious looser (leave its gadgets aside, talking about a car at the moment). Camry and Accord were not even considered because of old styling, personal preferences and "every other has it" trademark.
Handling is precise: if you have ever driven german cars you can't call it stiff - it's exactly what it should be.
V6 is responsive and assuring (I tested 4-banger as well and have to say I was pleasantly surprised by its performance).
The controls are well laid out and easy readable, although I would prefer cruise control to be located right on the steering wheel. Shifting is precise, no complains there. Good braking: while testing the car I braked hard from 60 Mph to a complete stop - no waiving from side to side, I had the full control of the car and the braking distance was way better of that of other cars I've put through the same test.
I am not very crazy about "wood" paneling inside, but on the other hand I'm not a big fan of wood trim altogether. My wife loves it though...
Front seats are comfortable and supportive. I had two adults riding in the back (pretty sizeable ones) and they felt it was enough leg/shoulder/hip room for both of them.
The car is brand new, so I probably need more time to come up with additional flaws. At the meantime I just enjoy my car...
0% APR/36 months or 1,9% APR/60 months and $1250 rebate is a definite PLUS too...
After we bought the car my wife could not get me out from behind the wheel for two days! Should I say anything else?
