            After being a die-hard 35mm user for the most of my life.  I found the Sony addition to the Cyber shot line most surprisingly impressive.  

Over the years I have compiled a mass of expensive 35mm equipment.  I invested more money and lots of time for the education to use it.  This stuff was a careful combination of selective quality equipment.  I was proud of my collection of photo toys.  Little did I know, that would all change.

Early on, we 35mm amateur photographers would have to wait for film to be developed to see the results.  Only to wish you had bracketed.  (A practice used to provide 3 or so choices of exposure) Then to wish again you had pushed it a little more.  

All this is changed with the advent of the DSC-S70.  I should be more upset about this.  Except, I bought one too.  Haven�t used my 35mm stuff since.  I actually went thought Christmas and New Years Holiday season without lugging around 25pounds of stuff.  

Still have not invested in additional memory.  However, I will when the $800.00 wears off my credit card.  I�m afraid 8MB of memory will not be enough for anyone wanting to shoot lots of detail in lots of quantity.  That�s all this baby comes with.  Unless you�ve installed the MGI software that comes with the camera onto a laptop, you will probably need more memory too.  Recycle time could be a little quicker too, but what you may lose in timing, you definitely gain in over all quality.

Some of the features that impressed me the most were in the controls.  You are able to control the �shutter speed� and the �aperture settings�.  Got a particular priority, or have a backlit situation, needing not only fill flash but, shutter priority?  Yes, you can do that too.  Turn off the flash and shoot at a slower shutter speed in available light for some extremely brilliant natural light shots.  The metering system used gets a bit complicated, suffice to say, if the camera�s exposure is off a little.  Fix it with MGI.  (The software that comes with the camera)  As far as the flash is concerned, the onboard is Okay.  There is a sync cord jack if you want more power.  Sony does have a larger flash that promises a larger guide number. (Guide number=flash 
Strength)

The most important thing to me as I shopped to transition over to the digital world, was color saturation and contrast and DETAIL.  Carl Zeiss made these things happen in a big way with the DSC-S70.  The glass on this camera is awesome.  I do not feel robbed or cheated in any way.  In fact, I not only highly recommend this camera, I challenge anyone to find a comparably equipped quality camera that delivers such a speedy (USB) file transfer rate.
