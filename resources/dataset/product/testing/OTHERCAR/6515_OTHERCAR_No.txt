            My hatred of Volvos began when my father bought one for my brother and thought it would be a good idea if he bought one for himself.  It would not have been so terrible if he had not decided five months later that he would pass down his 850 to me and buy himself a nice used 960.  His plan was to trade it in for one of the all wheel drive's that were coming out that fall.  Well, the plan never followed through and now I am stuck with his 850 while he is strutting around in his 960.  

The pros for his car is that is rarely breaks down if ever.  He bought it used from a man who fixes them up after someone has completely wrecked it.  In actuality, it has never broken down since he bought it a year and a half ago.  The gas mileage is excellent.  He travels a lot between cities in different states practically every day, and he never has problems.   Paying for gas is an expensive deal, around $20 for us every time, but it is well worth the investment.  The seat heaters are another plus.  

The cons are much more opulent than pros.  The only difference between his 960 and my 850 is that he has heated seats and prettier leather interior.  His came with rear-wheel drive which is not good for the travel he does.  It drives like most cars that you see elderly people in.  You do not feel the road much, which is good for you travel repellent people who tend to mess up the interior on long trips.  Preferably, I like to know that I am not floating off the road.  

I was discussing with my father the opportunity to buy myself a new car when he brought up the fact that he misses driving my car.  He does not like what he has and prefers the '95 850 that I drive.  He says that it accelerates much better and the heat comes on much faster.  When he is driving on the interstates, his 960 tends to drag and put him to sleep.  I do not recommend this car for those of you who travel much from his opinion.     <br><br>
