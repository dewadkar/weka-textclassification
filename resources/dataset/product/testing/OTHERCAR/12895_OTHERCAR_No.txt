            I have a 1995 Volvo 850 Turbo (predecessor to the S70) that I bought because I wanted a spacious, safe, and reliable family car that was still fun to drive and had more personality than the Accord or Camry.

What I love about this vehicle:
- excellent acceleration and handling
- very comfortable front seats for tall people
- large back seat &amp; trunk
- unique interior &amp; exterior styling

What I hate about this vehicle is the poor reliability, in the 20,000 miles I have owned the car the following have broken &amp; required repair:
- warped rear break rotors
- alarm system died
- power drivers seat back stuck in fully reclined position
- fuel pump died
- turbo vacuum hoses somehow punctured
- back knock sensor
- numerous rattles &amp; squeaks from the dashboard
- car has stalled twice during freeway driving

I had hoped Volvo would address their quality issues with the S70, however from the feedback I see here and given that Consumer Reports no longer recommends the car due to poor quality, I guess its not the case.

If you are used to low a maintenance, reliable car (I had an Acura &amp; Toyota previous) STAY AWAY FROM VOLVO! They are not reliable and are relatively expensive to repair.<br><br>
