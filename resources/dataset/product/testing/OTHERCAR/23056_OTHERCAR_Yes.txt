            I finally bought me a digital camera.  I like this one as it was inexpensive but comparable to another more expensive one.  Open up the front lens door and it is ready to go.  Hook up the connector-making sure you really push it in- and you are ready to download your photos onto the computer.  I use adobe photoshop to edit my photos so I am not familiar with the software for it.  I did like that all of the items came in the box.  Batteries, 2MB removable memory, carrying case, software, and connectors for computer and adapter for an outlet.  
As with all digital cameras they really use a lot of battery life.  I use the adapter to get my photos onto the computer.  Which by the way is very fast!!  It takes no time to download twelve photos.  
I do have a problem with the viewer- if you try and use the marked edges you can cut off parts of it.  You have to get a feel for it.  Also, there is a green light that is very annoying!  Sometimes the colors can come off wrong depending on the lighting.  You will need to practice some if you are not too familiar with digital cameras.  
I will say that it is easy to use for the most part. The low price tag is a bonus!<br><br>
