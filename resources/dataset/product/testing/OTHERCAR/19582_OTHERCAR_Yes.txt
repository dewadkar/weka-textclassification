            Although, sometimes, it feels like I am driving a small boat, the Suburban has been the best car we have bought yet.  When our family was about to expand to 6 and 2 were going to be in car seats, we knew we could no longer keep our 5 passenger jeep. This car has prooven itself on short travels around the city, to a 3000 mile trip back and forth to Calif.  The seats are very comfortable and large.  My son has enough room in a one passenger seat space, to lie down if he wants (Even with his seatbelt on).  My 5 year old, a toddler car seat and infant car seat, comfortably sit in the middle seat, while my 13 year old hogs the entire 3rd seat.  What is great about the 3rd seat is that, unlike many 3 seat cars, it is full width of the car and has a normal height of the floor.  That was a big plus to us as it is hard for adults to sit in a back seat where the floor is up higher.  There are 2 cup holders in the third seat and 2 for the middle seat.  There is front and rear control heating and air, and each seat has it's own dispensers.  To top off this wonderfully spacious car is its equally spacious trunk, bigger than the trunk of our jeep.  We have room for all the people and their luggage.  And if we need a little extra room, there is still the car rack.  If it weren't for the fact that it only gets about 15 highway miles per gallon, this would be the absolutely best thing on wheels.  I love it.
