            I bought this vehicle new when I found out that I was pregnant with my first child.  The car was awesome, everything my husband and I could have wanted in a car.  The first problems didn't start until this car was almost 5 yrs old with the water pump going out, which I think is typical. PLEASE KEEP READING. It has terrific ride and great handling, a total enjoyment to drive. The problems started when the car approached 7-8 yrs old.  The air condition compressor started leaking and eventually had to replace it...very expensive.  Now the car is approaching 10 yrs old and is beginning to have serious problems.  The check engine light comes on every time I drive it, the speedometer doesn't work and the radio stopped working(replaced with a used one from EBAY).  The synchronizer for the transmission went out.  We replaced it, but obviously it didn't cure everything because the car is getting about 1/2 the gas mileage it used to get.  At this point we don't know what to do with it.  PLEASE KEEP READING. I love my car, I would probably keep it another few years, but it is time for a new one.  My husband is a good mechanic and will probably try to fix it before we sell it.  Someone is going to get a really nice used car.  We are going to step up to an Acura which is another Honda product. 
THINGS I HATE ABOUT THIS CAR:  The radio quit working had to replace it, and the paint on the top of car is fading.  Called the dealership and they don't seem to care much about my older model car.  I think with a little bit of caring, Honda could eliminate these small problems.   **Seems to me that you can go to a junk yard and pick ANY old car and AT LEAST the radio works...
THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THIS CAR:  This is a car you can keep for 10 yrs.  This car can beat anything America has to offer +.  Sporty styling and yet still a family car.
