            If you are looking to jump into the world of digital photography without spending a lot of money, then this is the camera for you.  For most novice users, it has all the features you'll need to be pleasantly satisfied.

I have owned this camera for several months now and I use it regularly to snap pictures of the places I visit while Geocaching.  It easily fits into my pocket, only weighs around 6 ounces and the rechargeable batteries usually last me a good 1 to 2 weeks before they need to be recharge.  The quality of the outdoor pictures is outstanding.  They are crisp and clear and can easily be printed as 8X10 with no noticeable distortion.  

Inside pictures are about what you would normally expect for a camera in this price range.  In other words, it's not great but decent.  You usually have to stand fairly close to the subject otherwise they will probably come out a little dark.  As for the 2.5 digital telephoto lens, it was less than impressive.  I had to take several pictures before I managed to capture one that wasn't blurry.  However, persistence and a steady hand will pay off and you will eventually be successful in capturing a good looking closeup.

I have only used the mini-movie feature a couple of times just to experiment.  It's average at best and does not have sound.  It's fun to play around with, but don't buy the camera for this feature otherwise you'll be disappointed.

As for memory storage, it comes equipped with a 16MB xD card which is good for around 30 or so pictures.  You'd probably want to upgrade to a 64MB or 128MB card fairly quickly if you take a lot of pictures.

<b>My Final Thoughts</b>

All in all, this is an excellent digital camera for those just starting out.  If you like to take a lot of closeups, you'll probably have to spend a bit more and get a better camera.  This camera is a snap to use and uploading pictures to your computer is a breeze using the included USB cable.  Good luck!
