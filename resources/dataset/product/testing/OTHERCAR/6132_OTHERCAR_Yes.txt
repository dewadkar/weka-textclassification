            Let me start off by saying that I have a family connection in the car business. I mention this because it creates a couple perspectives for my review. One, I grew up Ford and Chrylser, only in the last two years having a Chevy connection. Second, Having the connection allows me to be a bit more financially choosy. That said, let's get on with it...

I was recently home for vacation when I decided to shop the lots for a new vehicle. I had kicked around several ideas (PT Cruiser, SportTrac, Durango, Intrepid) but hadn't really decided on anything in particular. Let's just say that when I drove my Impala LS, that settled it.

I had never been a fan of Chevy's interiors but I like this one. The right side of the radio and air controls can be a bit of a reach, but not terrible. I don't fiddle with the air much and this car had the more common radio controls on the steering wheel. My main gripe about that would be having the CD eject button on the far side.

The leather seats are incredibly comfortable. I drove the car back from Kentucky to Texas (14 hours) and never once felt like I needed to get out and my legs never fell asleep as they have in some other cars whose seats had a higher front lip.

The car gives you a smooth, quiet ride on good or bad roads, though in Arkansas, most any car will sound like an MD-80 jet. The transmission is as smooth as you can imagine, even when I laid on the gas.

There is lots of room in the front and back, and an incredible trunk, I'd compare it to my former hatchback to be honest.

The exterior styling get plenty of looks and for a guy, I've got a roomy sedan with plenty of sport looks and performance.

My only complaint is a couple things I need fixed, but it was a demo so I can't gripe too much. The outside temp gauge isn't working (sensor is bad) and the adhesive that holds the velcro that holds headliner around the sunroof up has given way. No worries though, all repairs are under warranty. I just don't want to go back to my old car while it's the Impala is in the shop. :)

A great value for the money, I'd compare it to the Chrysler 300M, but you get to keep about $10,000 bucks in your pocket.<br><br>
