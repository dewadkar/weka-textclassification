            I just graduated from college and was looking to lease my first vehicle.  I have always liked the look of SUVs so I looked at the jeep.  I test drove the Jeep Cherokee Sport and really liked the was it handled.  I didn't feel like I was driving something too big to handle.  Ever since purchasing it I have fully enjoyed it.  It has a stiff suspension so you do feel bumps a little more then normal, but this is a Sport so that is expected.  The bumpiness isn't nearly as bad as in the Wrangler.  I have driven it on long trips and have been very comfortable.  There is plenty of leg room, even in the back.  If you really needed a lot more leg room in the back then you could always look into those huge Expeditions or something.  The only grip I have about this car (which is not really about this car in specific, but more about all SUVs) is that they guzzle gas.  I fill my tank a lot more often then when I was driving my parent's car and with gas prices rising now that would be my only argument against getting a car like this.  But the car itself has been wonderful and I couldn't have asked for a better purchase.<br><br>
