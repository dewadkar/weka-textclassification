            We had just sold a 1990 Plymouth Voyager.  We didn't like the minivan design, so we were looking for a large car that could seat six people.  In 1996 we came across this 92 Lincoln Continental.  It seemed to be a great deal: a good-looking luxury car with tons of bells and whistles for the low price of $13,900.  So we bought it.  It was an excellent family car at first.  We took it on long trips and were very comfortable.  This car is powerful, the 3.8 liter fuel-injected V6 is no toy.  It's a lot of fun to drive.  The climate control is great along with the digital speedometer and information center.  The car also has an accurate digital compass.  The front seats are fully adjustable to any imaginable position, and the back seats provide plenty of leg room.  And the sound system isn't bad either.

So we drove it for about a year and a half and then came the problems...  everything from head gaskets to air conditioning to suspension problems, etc. Plus, tons of recalls....  ugh.  What a nightmare.  But every time we fixed something, the car was back to normal for a few months, and then it started all over again.  I can say that this car never left us stranded on the side of the road, luckily.  But we didn't push our luck, we sold the car in July 2002 for $3900.
