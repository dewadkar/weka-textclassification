            My friend Bob from Hallandale called last weekend and said the Suzuki dealer was giving away free hotdogs if you test drove the Grand Vitara.  Heck, I thought for a couple of hotdogs, hanging with Bob for a couple of hours, and also writing an epinion on the test drive, this would be a win, win situation.

The Grand Vitara has a hot 2.5-liter, 155 hp, V-6 engine as standard equipment.  The McPherson Strut suspension with separately located coil springs and shock absorbers allowed the Grand Vitara to give us a very quiet ride.  The front strut and rear shock absorbers are nitrogen charged to provide for consistent dampening and control, even when Bob decided to test drive this baby off the road.  On the road, we experienced a high level of ride comfort with a quiet, well-isolated cab.  The front seat had plenty of room and power for Bobs 300+ pound frame.

The Grand Vitara has four models.  Standard equipment includes power mirrors, windows and locks; keyless entry; air conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering wheel; rear wiper-washer; roof rails, and a micron filtration ventilation system.  There are also dual front air-bags, dual three-point seat belts that could go around Bob, daytime running lights and four-wheel anti-lock brakes.

The Grand Vitara is available in both rear-drive only and the versatile four-wheel drive system.  The Grand Vitara drove like a champ off the road, and we enjoyed the easy maneuverability drive on the road.

If the opportunity presents itself to test drive a Grand Vitara and also get a couple of hot dogs out of the experience, I highly recommend you go for it.
