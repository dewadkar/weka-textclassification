            ...I hate to put it that way, but since the 3-series is viewed as the standard in this highly competitive sport-compact class, even comparing the A4 to the BMW says a lot about the new Audi.

But before I get to specifics, let me tell you a little background about my car. It took me nearly a month to find an A4 with the specifications that I wanted. I finally found a Ming Blue (Navy) 3.0L Quattro, with a Six-speed, Beige leather (I would have rather had Platinum), Bose stereo upgrade, heated mirrors, Xenon headlights, the Sport Package and auto dimming mirrors.

There were a few options which were perks that I could eliminate from my list when I was searching for the car, but let me tell you about some of those that should be on your list if you are looking to buy. 

Forget heated seats. Auto dimming mirrors are a nice feature, especially with all the SUVs on the road that blind you at night. However, the essentials are the 3.0 liter engine, the 6-speed manual transmission, the Sport package and the Bose sound system. 

The only downside of the bigger engine is cost, but the benefits outweigh the price. It is very smooth and linear, unlike the Turbo which boosts after a certain RPM. Audi's 1.8L Turbo does not lag much, but the 3.0L is much more smooth. Add a nice sporty growl enhanced by dual exhaust (which is standard with both engines) and 50 extra horsepower (220 for the 3.0) and cost does not seem like such an issue. Plus, a Turbo engine generally has more mechanical problems than does a naturally aspirated. The 3.0 launches from 0-60 mph in 6.8 seconds with the manual, depending on who you ask (in my instance, Car and Driver). 

The manual transmission is very smooth as well. The throws are long, yet each up-shift or down-shift is nearly effortless. I have not driven a new BMW with a manual transmission, but I have heard the Audi cannot compare. A negative for the Bimmer though is that it is only a 5-speed while the Audi, as mentioned before, has six gears, which makes selecting a gear for such things as passing, easier.

The Sport package includes a stiffer suspension setup and 17 inch, 5 spoke wheels. In addition, high performance, low profile tires are included. I bought the Sport package, which is almost $1,000, simply for the wheels, which give the A4, especially in Ming Blue, a sporty yet refined look. The wheels alone are worth the extra cost. The standard 16 inch�ers are boring and the tires are chunky, definitely not sporty. The suspension is firm, and the car handles very well, especially with the Quattro. It rides well, only becoming uncomfortable on big bumps, which by the way do not damage the wheel rims. I live in a community with speed bumps and driving the Audi with back seat passengers, I have heard no complaints, and I find I do not have to slow down any more than I would in another car to make the ride better. A word of warning though, watch out for dips and parking lot barriers. They scrape up the gray plastic spoiler at the front of the car which provides down force at higher speeds. A torn up spoiler can ruin a car's appearance, so lower your speeds when encountering these obstacles.

The Bose system is great. It upgrades the standard system to 13 speakers, including a center channel speaker like you would find on a digital audio system for home movie viewing, which handles dialogue. The bass is deep and rich, and the speakers are crisp. There is also a programmable system that compensates for road noise by raising a lowering the volume of the system. There is an in-dash 6 disc CD changer, which is also included in the standard setup. It is easy to load and eject CDs (if you are not familiar with an in-dash system, it holds X-many, in this case 6, CDs which are stacked and can be loaded simply into the stereo), but don't try this while driving, unless you have a passenger who can do it for you. Much more convenient than the old in-trunk setup on the pre-2002 A4s. I have had a problem however with the stereo already after only two-months. It suddenly does not work, and the display is back lit all the time. So I see red, but hear no sound (and yes I have tried turning up the volume). Called the Audi people and I will be taking it in, but I don't know what is wrong with the system yet. On that note, Audi service is great, friendly and very helpful. You should not need the service much however, as the Audis are praised for excellent build quality, which is even superior to the BMW.

The A4 gets good gas mileage, about 22 mpg �round town. I have driven on a road trip and gotten 30, which was impressive. Conservation is aided by a display in the instrument cluster that shows MPG almost to the second while you are driving. The display also shows time, temperature, radio frequency, doors open, gas left etc. If you get the GPS system, the directions will be displayed here. I imagine for someone of average height, the display is in just the right place, and for my tall frame, it does not require any awkward movements of the eye from the road. Just a quick glance does it.

The seats are comfortable. If you have ridden in a Volvo, they are not quite as comfy as those, but they are better than a BMW and an Infiniti's. Room is ample in the front, yet cramped in the back. There are plenty of adjustments to be made to the front seats to find the perfect driving position and you can store up to 4 positions in a memory pad located on the driver door, which remembers seat location and mirror location. Back seat room has increased by 1 inch (can you say insignificant?), but they feel much more roomy than the previous model. For one, there are inlets to put knees and there is space under the seat to place your feet. I have ridden comfortably back there for an hour, and I am 6 foot, 5 inches, so they can't be all that bad.

As for the styling. It is very fresh and sporty. I hate the grey plastic aero-parts, but some people like it, saying it gives the car a rugged look. Plastic aside, the A4 is very muscular, sporty looking, yet it can be very elegant. Body color makes a huge difference. I must say the darker colors combined with the sport wheels are the best look. As for A6 owners and "Audi Purists" who complain the new A4 looks too much like the current A6, I say, who cares? It is a great looking machine- they're just jealous.


The Xenon lights are awesome, and combined with the halogen brights, produce a retina-scorching amount of light. It is enough to brighten the darkest of back roads. The fog lights work well too, which along with the Quattro system, are reassuring in heavy downpours.

Some minor complaints. The front armrest is awkward. It makes shifting hard in certain positions, yet I have found a "comfort zone". The armrest also blocks the hand-brake when placed as low as it can go. An engineering mistake, although the armrest will rest in a position that does not impede in the movement of the hand-brake, so that problem is easily remedied. The seating position can be made awkward as well if you are tall. At first I moved the seat backwards, which meant my left elbow was hanging off the edge of the armrest on the door. Minor, but it was uncomfortable. However I soon found the more comfortable driving position is down low, and closer to the steering wheel. Now I drive comfortably. 

Also, the sunroof is horrible. Although it is a decent option, and you'll have a hard time finding a car without it, the wind noise is like anything I have ever witnessed. Like a bass drum, the pressure is unbearable, especially to sensitive ears. Audi recommends positioning the sunroof to safe mode (I have forgotten the "technical term"), which mean, the roof is closed very slightly to reduce the noise. It helps, as does a slightly open rear window, but I recommend Audi fixes the problem instead.


Forget all the numbers. Five stars? Four? It doesn't matter. This is a great car. While it won't redefine the class, like the 3-series has done, the A4 has already forced BMW and the likes to include more standard features in their new cars in order to make them more competitive. I bought my A4 for $40,000, just below sticker price, but that was when the cars were first introduced. I'm sure you could work out a better deal now that more models are available. Think of it this way. Since I have been comparing the Audi to the BMW all the way, the A4 is nearly $10,000 less than its counterpart (depending on what model you acquire, options etc. the price may be closer). Plus, the 3-series is so common now, it can't compete with the new A4s shock value. I get looks wherever I go. If you value that sort of thing, there is no better feeling than walking up to the car in a lot and seeing other people eyeing it. A wonderful machine, that is still rare, a joy to drive, and a great value- for its class.
