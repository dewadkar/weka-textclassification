            I purchased a 2003 Mazda6i on May 19, 2003. My car is Redfire Metallic with an automatic transmission and premium package (alloy wheels and power driver's seat). I chose this car over the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, and Toyota Camry largely due to the superior driving characteristics of the 6.

Exterior
I believe that the Mazda6 is one of the best-looking sport sedans on the road. The car has been designed to be practical and beautiful. There are many aftermarket modifications you can make to your Mazda6 to give it a unique appearance. I have found the paint to be EXTREMELY durable. After 7,000 miles, I do not have a single chip or scratch. The headlights are not only cool-looking but extremely functional.

Interior
The silver console gives the car a distinctive appearance. Be careful, however--the silver console scratches very easily and is not cheap to replace. The gauges are very easy to read, and the tilting/telescoping steering wheel ensures that every driver will find the perfect driving position. I have also found the power driver's seat easy to use.

The seats are very firm and supportive, but the cloth seat fabric is very rough. Other Mazda6 owners have had problems with the fabric wearing and fraying prematurely, which is covered under warranty. The glovebox is very deep and locks (a nice touch). There is also a trunk lockout control located in the glovebox. I have had no problem fitting four adults in my Mazda, but five would be a pinch. Keep in mind, however, that this car is noticeably smaller than its main competitors.

For the ladies (and vain guys), there are lighted mirrors located in the sun visor (both for driver and passenger). The trunk is absolutely enormous, thanks to the space-saving rear suspension design.

Ride Quality
For a sports sedan, the ride is very plush. The ride is not as supple as the Camry or the Accord, but the car was not designed to be a "road cruiser." Mazda made a nice compromise between ride quality and driving experience.

Performance
I decided to get a 4-cylinder due to fuel economy. I have a 45-mile per day commute. While the power is not outstanding, it's sufficient to get you to where you need to go. I recently took a "road trip" to Las Vegas, and I had no problems passing semi's on the freeway.

One word of warning--the air conditioner really takes the oomph out of the engine. Make sure the A/C is on when you go and take a test drive.

Many Mazda6 owners have complained about the rough-shifting automatic. I have found that the transmission has gotten smoother over time, but it will never be as smooth as the class leaders. On the positive side, the shifts are quick and the transmission seels well-mated to the engine.

By the way, I have been averaging around 27 mpg in mixed driving.

Reliability/Etc.
My Mazda6 has been relatively trouble-free. At 1,500 miles, the Check Engine Light came on. The computer needed to be reflashed (shortly after my visit to the dealer, Mazda recalled many 6's because of this problem).

At 5,000 miles, the driver's side visor started to "droop" and would not stay at the top of the headliner. Within a week the part arrived and was fixed (under warranty).

One troubling problem that many members are reporting is rust spots underneath the weatherstripping on the doors. This is a relatively new problem, and I haven't heard what Mazda's position on the problem is. Before purchasing this vehicle, I would either contact Mazda directly (www.mazdausa.com), or check out the car discussions at www.edmunds.com. I do not have the rust on my car, but I would have had serious doubts about buying this car if I had heard about this sooner.
**UPDATE: MAZDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND IS CURRENTLY ISOLATING WHICH PRODUCTION LINES THIS PROBLEM AFFECTS.**

Mazda also does not have as many dealers as its main competitors. After a bad purchasing experience, I no longer go to the selling dealer. The nearest dealer to me is 20 miles away. While not a great distance, it makes routine maintenance a challenge (I like to take my car to the dealer during the warranty period for service).
