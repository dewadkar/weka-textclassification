            Back in 1990, we decided that we needed a truck. I like to woodwork, and it would be handy for hauling lumber, etc. Also, with the hot rod in the garage, we decided to tow it to car shows. A few other odds and ends that called for a truck also made us go looking. 

We wound up with a 1991 model GMC. It has the flareside bed, and a 350 engine. Nearly ten years later, the truck is still in one piece, and is holding together nicely. Granted, I tend to take exceptional care of my cars, but it's nice to know that something will last when you take proper care of it. 

The ride is fair... usually a little bumpy, unless we're either towing or hauling something. It's light in the bed, which causes the bumpiness, and makes it feel a little unstable. The engine is powerful, and gas mileage is not as bad as one might think given the size of the truck.

The in cab amenities are few, but given that it's a ten year old vehicle, I don't mind so much. Power windows and door locks, etc, it good enough for me. The air conditioner and radio work, and I am quite happy cruising along listening to the oldies station. 

Our truck didn't come with seats with a headrest... On longer drives, it can get a little uncomfortable. For around town driving though, the seats are fine. 

I've never had any problems mechanically up until last year, when I had the transmission rebuilt. The only other blunder was that the color I got was white. About 2-3 years after I got it, the very thin layer of paint on there started peeling. It got to the point where when I would wash the truck, I could spray off large chunks of paint with the garden hose. That was a little disheartening. I had to have the entire truck repainted with an actual think paint job, and have had no worries since. 

All things considered, this truck has done what it was supposed to for 10 years, ad generally, with regular maintenance, there have been few problems.<br><br>
