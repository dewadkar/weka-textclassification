            I purchased a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have owned three other sport utility vehichles including chevy and ford.  I have only had a couple of minor problems with my jeep. The tires were out of balance when I drove it off the lot. That problem was fixed. The only other problem is the plastic covers that go over where the seat belt connects to the inside frame of the car. When the first &quot;broke off&quot; I wondered if I may have broken it off by accident. Less than a month later the other side came off. The dealer says I must have broken them. They are in a place that it would be next to impossible for an owner to break one of them off, let alone both of them. Other than this, I love my Jeep. It has a much (much much much much) quieter rider than my chevy blazer.<br><br>
