            Strengths: Look and feel are great. People ask me about it all the time and I do not have one bad thing to say. It drives like a nissan car. Of course it's a truck so it has a stiffer ride but quiet and comfy too. I got 6k miles on mine and it's fine. Mileage about 18/20 hwy for me. I do not take it in the woods or anything but I load it up with video equipment, cameras tv's lights and so on and it is great.
My first SUV and I walk out every day and see it and I still love it. Good A/C and heater too. Cd player is killer. 
Weaknesses: Not many. 
When I bought mine they had a mini-shortage that drove prices up but I kept bargaining and finally got a fair deal.
I think the V6 has plenty of power for me but towers of huge boats or trailers might want another vehicle, and that's a given. I am probably an average user too. 
Similar Products Used: Jeep Cherokee. My brother has a 95 Jeep country and it does not even compare. Boxy and lower, the spare tire is in the back which takes up room and it rides bumpy but has a little more powerful engine. Ny friend has had many Toyota 4runners and I rode in two of them, no big deal. 
Review Summary: I have ridden in a Toyota Limited, Toyota 4runner, a Jeep Cherokee Country and my Xterra and I must say I like the Xterra the best. 
The Toyota is overpriced for this size of vehicle. If you drive an Xterra it will remind you of all the nice things about Nissans in general. Good engineering and useable amenities. I don't need leather.
I paid $21,200 for an Aztec red XE, 5sp, CD, V6. Sport and utility package. No sunroof or rubber stripes on the sides, no big deal. I had a sunroof on my 240sx and hardly used it. You'll pay about 1k more for automatic.
If you are like a lot of other people and want a fun, dependable, rugged on and off road vehicle, for the money, and I did my homework for months, it rocks.<br><br>
