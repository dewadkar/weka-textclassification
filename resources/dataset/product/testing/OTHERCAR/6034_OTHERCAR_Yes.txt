            My wife and I had not even considered the L-Series Saturn as a replacement for her three year old Volvo S70.  We were looking at small SUVs and crew cab pickups and dropped in on a Saturn dealership to look at the VUE.  The combination of price, a V6, leather seats, and generally attractive lines prompted us to test drive an L300 with the premium package.  

First, price: At $23,730 for a V6 "midsize" sedan with leather seats and a 6-disk cd player with upgraded speakers--it's a bargain.  Comparably-equipped cars from Nissan and Toyota cost considerably more.  

Ride, Handling, and Power:  We had owned a couple of SL2's a few years ago and, while they were dependable cars and the service was great, they were also noisy and never at a loss for vibration.  They climbed down into any pot hole like a stiff-legged kangaroo and transmitted every crack in the pavement directly to the small of my back.  The L300 was quiet, nimble, easy-shifting, and accelerated in a way I haven't felt in either an Altima or a Camry.  This car was easily comparable to the driving quality of the Volvo we had grown tired of maintaining.  And it cornered much better and with a shorter turning radius.

Cargo room:  The trunk is ENORMOUS.  But there is a general lack of places to cram stuff from the front seats.  The glove box door is big, but conceals a relatively small box.  The center console storage bin is almost our of reach from the front seat and small.

Comfort:  Unlike the pillowy version of leather seats you might encounter in, say, a Grand Cherokee or Mercedes, the leather seats in the Saturn were rather stiff, but supportive.  And, at 5'11", my short-cut hair was brushing the roof.  With the seat all the way back, I couldn't completely straighten out my legs on the passenger side front.  That said, the general comfort level in the front seats is better than average for a car of this size.  

Ergonomics:  Oops.  As everyone else noted, the window controls on the driver side are difficult to get to.  And don't even try to adjust bass or treble on the stereo at night.  On the other hand, the roof handles in the cab are tastefully presented and very useful for the more youth-challenged users of the rear seats--which are at a much better height from  ground level than the SL's we'd owned.  Everything is within easy reach, except for the window controls.  The leather wrapped steering wheel exhibits little "give" and I'm wondering if it won't get slick and slippery with time and body oils.

Service/Maintenance:  Unless you're towing something or live in a dust bowl, there's no set oil change interval.  change it when the oil change light comes on.   And when you do change the oil, you can reset the idiot light yourself.   If you're a DIYer, everything you need to reach in the engine compartment is easily accessible, with the exception of the cabin filter--which won't be difficult to change, but don't wear a suit to do it.  

The service at the Saturn dealerships we've dealt with in the past have been great about keeping appointments and getting the work done right.  Warranty work has always been handled very cleanly.

I do not believe that the L100 or L200 is comparable in driving experience, power, handling, or noise level.  But the L300, for the price, is a real jewel.
