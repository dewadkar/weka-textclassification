            My Friend recently bought a 2000 Kia Sephia, not listening to my friends and I telling him that Kia's are cheaply made, and that is why they are cheap.  He ended up not listening, and buying it.  Well I've in driven it, and the engine is loud, the steering is very Erratic, the radio is terrible, and two months into having the car, already the started is taking its time to get the car moving.
My friend has what most people would call terrible credit.  Now I wont delve into this but, he's had his share of bounced checks, and maxed out credit cards.  The Kia dealer is the only place in California that would give this kid a loan, only place.  Which makes me tend to think that they just wanted to sell the car, it is the lenders butt if they give a loan to someone with bad credit, knowing they haven't paid people back before.  Also they charged him about $12,000 for the car, when I've heard they've been going for the most of 9 to $10,000.  Now Consumer Reports says &quot;This is the worst car we've driven,&quot; and that's a pretty reliable source on the subject. If you don't believe me check out their 1999 Consumer Reports book, probably at any Wal-mart or Target, find KIA Sephia, there it is, from the experts.

On the other hand, if you want to buy an inexpensive car, that you expect to own for two or three years, I think KIA Sephia is the way to go.  They look sporty on the outside, there isn't to much room for 6'4 people like me in the back, but for you average height person, it isn't that bad. For your moneys worth, I say, buy a used car, most are reliable, and you can get a great price on them off the streets.

My friend has recently been having problems with his acceleration.  He says that when he &quot;floors it,&quot; it acts very sluggish and boggs down the engine, producing little power.
