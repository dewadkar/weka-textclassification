            Why did I buy? Because I was very happy with the C2020. I wanted to try the new 3.3 Millions pixel.

My experience: Easy to use (don't believe what they say about complexity and many menus to master).

Love about it: Sharp pictures, excellent colors even in very low light conditions. Versatile (video clips of up to 3 minutes, but rather One minute if you have the 16 MB Flash card). 

Hate? I have not found anything yet except that the lens cap has no attachment and is bound to be lost sooner or later. This is ridiculous and done on purpose by Olympus to sell very expensive cap replacements. At this price level, they should not play this old game. Really bad and damaging for their image. 

Who should buy? Any one who wants digital pictures as good as paper based (35mm films) pictures. Quality on Epson or other good color printer is identical as a KODAK print from the shop. Really!<br><br>
