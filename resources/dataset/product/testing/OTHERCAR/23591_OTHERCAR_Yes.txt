            I have had this car for 1 year and have done 18,000 trouble free miles and I still get a rush from driving it each day. 

Prior to getting this vehicle I compared the BMW 328i and Audi A4 2.8 and also the BMW 330i. The 330i is a superb vehicle, in some areas better than the IS300, and I was impressed enough to put down a deposit on the 330i. However at $42.5K when loaded to a similar spec as the IS300 (which cost me $34.5K) it doesn't stand a chance.

The IS and 330i are equally quick on the road if they are both automatics (to me it is unfair to compare a manual to an automatic) and at the track the IS300 beat the BMW 328 auto in braking, acceleration and through the curves when I drove them.

Where the IS really shines (outside of value) is in the looks department. I still get compliments from other drivers all the time. The exterior is taut and aggressive with a great standard wheel and tire package, the interior has the superb ecsaine material (vastly better than leather), the seats are great for non-stop 6+ hour drives and the controls and dials are easy to use and read. Best of all is the standard killer sound system with CD-changer that puts any upgraded system from MB, BMW, and other Lexus models to shame.

On the downside I miss certain features I have had on my other Lexus and BMW vehicles (auto dimming mirrors, memory seats, armrest). Worst of all is the lack of a manual which would suit this car perfectly - this is due to arrive August 2001 and I may 'upgrade' to it. The 2002 model also adds more options to the list.

Finally I will say that BMW owners (myself included) should applaud Lexus for releasing this vehicle and finally giving BMW some competition. Already BMW have stiffened the steering on the 3 series and later this year a lot more content will become standard on the 3 series at no additional cost (sports package, upgraded sound system etc). The buyer wins whichever car they buy.
