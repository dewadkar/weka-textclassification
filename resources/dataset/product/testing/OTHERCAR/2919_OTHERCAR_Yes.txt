            My RSX isn't even 3 weeks old and I've put nearly 4000 kilometers on it. It is such a dream to drive! (I'm a big time commuter) I opted for the Premium model (canadian) due to the fact that I'm 21 and insurance premiums for the type-S are insane! 

So my first impression upon driving the RSX is the handling. If you're looking for a super smooth ride, this isn't the car for you. It has a much stiffer suspension than I expected. I mean, it's built for going fast, not to bring grandma to church. Not having much experience with a standard transmission, I found the gears to be very smooth (expect for a little jerkiness in first and second.. but maybe that's simply my inexperience). I absolutely love the look and feel of the car. It's slick appearance beats the pants off of the overbearing design of the celica or tiburon. It's much classier. The 6 o'clock start on the  dash controls, the titanium knobs, the small racecar-like steering wheel and the red lights at night give it such a distinctive feel. 
The seating is ample...only for the driver and front passenger. My 220 pound football player friend didn't feel at home in the backseat for a long trip last weekend (Sorry!)

I'm a packrat, so I would have appreciated a little more cubby space room in the front.. but that's a minor complaint. 
Although I haven't used them yet, I believe the heated seats and mirrors for those cold, cold, cold northern winters will be a godsend. :) And the lumbar support is whipping my posture into shape. Compared to my last car (1999 Chevy Cavalier Z24) this car is beyond compare. I think i'm in love. ;)
