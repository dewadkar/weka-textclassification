            Buying a car these days is not an easy task.  If you watch any television, the ads are increasingly more 'seductive' and what some woman thinks of me because of my car should not weigh into the purchase decision.  Years ago when I decided to purchase a new car, I had traveled up and down what is called the 'auto mile' here locally.  I know you all know the area I mean - the stretch of road that seems to have nothing but car dealers on it.  I was so turned off by the treatment, the pressure to buy something I did not really need (nor could I afford) or even the being snuffed by a salesman simply because I did not 'look' like I could afford one of their cars I started to drive home.  That is when I saw the Saturn dealership.  I had never even heard of Saturn cars at the time and only made the decision to stop in because they were apart from all the rest and I figured I had nothing to lose.

Well, here it is 7 years later and I am on my 4th Saturn.  4th you say?  Yes, not because of any problems.  My car needs have changed and Saturn has been able to meet those needs quite effectively.  My first purchase changed the way I felt about car dealers and salesman completely and I have returned 3 times since.  The first time in my 25 years of driving that I have bought the same make car not only a second time, but a third and fourth as well.  I certainly have developed a brand loyalty.

The new L series car has received a lot of mixed reviews.  After owning an SL-1, SL-2 and the SC-2 3-door model, I must say that the new LS-2 is a step up in every way without making me work just to pay for it.  The first thing I noticed was the sound - quiet.  The inside when driving is so quiet I found that I am not turning up the CD player to hear the music when on the highway.  The interior room is plentiful but does not give you that 'swimming' feeling.  Everything is well within reach in the front and my rear seat passengers have all remarked at how comfortable it is in the back.

Handling is a whole new experience.  The car seems to glide well into turns and comes out just as smoothly.  I do a lot of driving and most of it over mountains and through the vast New England countryside - winding roads that range from packed dirt to pot-hole/frost-heave damaged obstacle courses.  This car has held the road and been so responsive I found it is less effort to drive.

The V-6 engine, although only available in an automatic (the ONLY drawback  that I can think of,) is very responsive to acceleration.  Passing power is instant and the car overtakes vehicles without any problem.  While driving through the mountains I have never felt like it was straining to make it to the top (with my smaller SC-2 on the same road I was downshifting into 2nd by the time I reached the top.)  The LS-2, even under cruise control, seems to make the same peak smaller somehow.

The interior is comfortable and comes equipped with enough features as standard equipment that luxury comes to mind immediately.  A stylish dash arrangement and smart controls make things easy to operate without reading a manual.  One of the nice features is the cassette AND CD player built in.  Now I can listen to my music when I want, but also, I can still play the audio books and language learning tapes I have.  For me here in the northeast a real plus is the heater.  The heater?  Yes, the heater.  Winters here can be very cold.  It is nice to have a car that gets warm fast so your whole drive to work is not in the cold.

The bigger trunk space has proven to be a valuable plus.  The valet locking features for the trunk and the locking glove compartment add more security than in previous models.  The 60/40 split fold down rear seat is still a plus in this larger model.  Now you can lock these as well to prevent them from being folded down gaining access to the trunk.

The gas mileage goes down a bit with the V-6.  But remember you have a bigger car, bigger engine and more weight to move around.  With my SC-2 I was getting on average 330 miles to a tank of gas.  With my new LS-2 I am getting around 315 miles to a tank of gas.  Not bad.  I probably drove the SC-2 a little faster than I should.  I definitely drive the LS-2 more conservatively.

Over all I would rate the LS-2, V-6 model a solid, well built, excellent car for the money.  Equal to comparable cars in every way but one - price.  I would have to say that dollar for dollar, the Saturn LS-2 is the best value in its class.<br><br>
