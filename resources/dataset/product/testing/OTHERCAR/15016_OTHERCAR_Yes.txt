            We bought this camera 2 years ago and have taken thousands of pictures with it. It is still working perfectly and still on the market which I believe is because of its reliability. Do take note it is an older camera, so the newer cameras would have more features and bigger storage space.

This camera stores its pictures on a 1.44MB floppy disk so you can view and transfer your pictures easily from any computer. I am very happy with the quality of the images, I use it for web, email and family pictures. Of course it does not have the picture quality or resolution of a professional camera (for which you can pay thousands), but 20 to 30 pictures per disk in JPEG format is good enough for me (fine mode, that is). Or one Bitmap photo will fit onto a disk for better quality and it will also store a JPEG image along there with it.

There are two main modes, camera and play mode. The main feature in the play mode allows you to view your photos and also delete the ones you don't like. In the camera mode the screen shows you everything the lens captures, so all you have to do then is press the button to take the picture.  I have to say though, it is hard to see the screen on a bright sunny day but that would go for a lot of digital cameras also.

It has several picture effects, such as negative art, black and white and a few extras. A 10x zoom (which is handy), a long life battery, it displays battery life and also the space left on the disk.

To wrap it up, it is a very reliable, quality camera with many features and it still stands its grounds with the newer, more expensive cameras. An excellent value for money.
