            I received this camera for Christmas. Setting it up was so simple. Didn't even need to look at the manual. The size is about right for about everyone to use. It has a 1.8 inch LCD, JPEG compression and very user friendly. On super high resolution-12 images, on high-24, on medium-36, and on low-96. It has 10 sec. self timer and 3 modes of focus-Macro,Close-up and Normal. The software that comes with this camera is alot of fun. I have had friends over and we have spent hours playing around with the camera and software. The quality of the pictures is not the absolute best, but for the price, they are good. I have found that pictures taken outside are better than those taken indoors. We have taken beautiful pictures of the sunset and even a few of a full moon. This particular camera came with an ac adapter.(Which is about a $20.00 value) This makes it nice for uploading and not having to worry about batteries dying on you. 

I had been using a Fuji before this one and the pictures are better on the Polaroid. The price difference is about $100.00 (with the Fuji being more expensive). This camera is a great little camera for those just starting out with digitals. It also comes with a television cable so that you can view your pictures right on your t.v. This makes it especially nice when going to friends or families homes that do not own a pc.<br><br>
