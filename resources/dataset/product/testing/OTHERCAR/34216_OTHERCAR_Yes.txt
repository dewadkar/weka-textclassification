            <b>Why did I buy it ?</b>
I have had several Jeeps before and always loved them. I have had two CJ's and one YJ before. A few months ago, I decided it was time for something more comfortable for my daily commute on the Oklahoma streets. If you don't know what streets in Oklahoma, especially in Oklahoma City, are like - think off roading.
I found this 1995 Cherokee SE at a dealership at $7500. After checking the blue book, I decided it was a fair price and bought it.
Here are a few features this Jeep had: Automatic, a/c, power steering, cruise control, 31" tires.

<b>What's good about it</b>
-It's fast. I was surprised how good the 4.0 engine accelerated. I felt like I was in a sports car, only about 3 feet higher.
-Gas mileage. I got an average of 19mpg, driving a mixture of highway/city traffic.
-Reliability. I just sold the car after driving it more than 5000 miles in three months. I did not have one problem, and that at a mileage of 135k. So far, I have only heard good things about the inline 6 engines. One of my CJ's had the same engine with 200+k miles and was still running smooth.
-Design. I very much like the fact that the design has not undergone any major changes in about the last 15 years. I like the shape and I don't like it when car makers change the body style of a car every year just to attract new customers. It is easy to find parts for the Cherokee because you can usually use those parts from a 90 or earlier model for newer models.

<b>What's bad about it</b>
-Handling. I got the impression that when driving on the freeway at more than 60mph, I had to correct where the car was going more than in other SUV's.
-Back seats. In this 4 door version, there was not much space for passengers in the rear.
-Cruise control. The cruise control is very precise, meaning that it will not vary more than about 1 mile per hour. This means that whenever it goes even slightly uphill, the car will shifts down and accelerate full throttle to make sure it will stay at the exact same speed. This can be annoying at times.

<b>Summary</b>
I recommend this car for anybody looking for a safe SUV that is still economical. I have not heard of anyone having major problems with the Cherokee and I am sure there is a good reason there are some many of them out there on the streets. I still see a great number of 80's model Cherokees on the streets. I drove this car from Oklahoma to Northern California. It was a nice trip, I always felt comfortable and the car did not give me any trouble.
