            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a great vehicle to own.  I bought one in 1995 because I just graduated from college and was driving approximately 40 miles to and from work each day.  
The Grand Cherokee even though it is not great on gas mileage has a very easy ride.  The interior will withstand the toughest of stains, as I have found first hand with a toddler and various spills.  The exterior is also very nice.  My Grand Cherokee color is Driftwood.  It doesn't show dirt as easily as others and it doesn't dull as fast as other colors that I have seen.
The bad thing about the Grand Cherokee is that it has a tendency to want to hydroplane on wet surfaces, but so do other Sports Utility Vehicle's.  I can tell you first hand that they do withstand being submerged in about 5 feet of water without any non-repairable damage.
I have been thoroughly pleased with My Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I has taken my family on various family vacations including the Buffalo River, St. Louis, MO, and on a roller coaster ride in snow and ice.  It has also survived a collision with an eight point whitetail buck bouncing down the driver's side with only minor scratches.  That's my grand tour.  I would recommend purchasing a Grand Cherokee to anyone interested in a Sports Utility Vehicle.  One word of advise though, Do not lease.  As I have and paid for it dearly.<br><br>
