            I recently purchased this vehicle because I couldn't put up with more than 100k on the odometer!  I bought it in 10/00 and it still has the powertrain warranty from Nissan because there were only 39k on it!  Back to the point, right off the bat I knew this would be a fantastic vehicle because I had seen them before and I liked the exterior styling.  It has a very aggressive front I think (contrary to others opinion).  The 2.4L I-4 is responsive, torquey and downright throttles of fun.  Being the 0-60 is 8.0s on a 4cyl is very impressive.  I enjoy driving this vehicle everywhere.  I live about 3 hours away from my girlfriend and I actually love driving there now.  The seats and overall interior styling is great.  The seats are comfortable but also really hold you in for the ride of your life.  This car is by no means the fastest, or quickest car but as the 240SX Organization says, &quot;We eat Hondas raw!&quot;
