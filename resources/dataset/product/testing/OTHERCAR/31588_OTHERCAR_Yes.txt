            While there are many higher end cameras out there now.  This is one that should not be overlooked.  This is not this years model, nor is it cutting edge.  But the reality of it is that if you want cutting edge 3+ megapixel your probably not going to utilize all the features or resolution.
As it stands I have only used the full resolution on this camera maybe a dozen times out of 1000 or so shots that I have kept.  Mainly I use the Normal or more likely the Fine quality ( leaving the basic and HI unused ) With Fine Quality I have had shots printed by Shutterfly that rival 35mm quality.  
If you plan on enlarging your shots further than 8x10" I would stay away from digital for a couple more years anyway and the printing costs and technology haven't yet bettered that of traditional film yet.  ( IF they will )

For the most part I haven't used all the bell's and whistles this model has to offer, but I will say that it's only drawback to me is the lens, although it's high quality it's range isn't great.  They do offer optional wide angle and telephoto lens kits.  I don't see much use for them as again, if I need to take shots other than high quality snapshots, I would prefer working with my 35mm set up.

The display is adequate, and as such has never justified my use of the traditional viewfinder.  

I could go into specs but you can get those anywhere, what I will say is that apart from the one pixel that occasionally freezes on me ( which can be corrected easily enough with any imaging program ) this camera has served me well.  The controls are easy to access, the flash is powerful enough for shots out to about 12 feet or so, the metering system is mostly accurate though as with any camera backlit shots sometimes confuse it.  The weight is nice it feels comfortable in most hands, my wifes are small and mine large.  
Overall I see or have had no reasons to upgrade to a newer model, apart from a dream about the high end digital SLR bodies.

What I do reccomend though is a bunch of rechargable batteries, ( I bought a pack of 16 on eBay for around $26. )  The monitor eats up power, so the rechargable's pay for themselves fast.  
I as with all lenses put a screw in filter it's cheap insurance against stupid screwups.  
Definately buy a larger memory card, I picked up a 64 which gives me plenty to work with.  ( though remember to keep that 8 with you just in case you run out of space ).
Lastly, I bought a SanDisk USB reader which speeds up and eases my downloads to the computer.

While this all comes down to a large investment,  I just spent a year taking shots of my daughter in which I saved at least the entire cost of this setup on 35mm processing fees alone.

I have no regret's having bought this camera whatsover.

While I have to admit that I do not treat my camera's with kids gloves I don't exactly bang them around.  ( this can be attributed to the long life span of my 8008, F4s and 2000 among others. )  BUT I do have to say that this camera either has a design flaw or I got a problem camera.    The focus is achieved thru a movable lens ( internally ) and it is connected to the camera via a very small section of cast metal.  The opposite side of the lens frame has a "c" shaped node that slides along a small rod to keep it aligned.  This metal piece entirely fractured leaving me with a lens that is entirely loose within the body of the camera.  Hence useless.   I have a total of possibly 1000 shots taken with this camera and I would imagine metal fatigue is very pre-mature.  More likely it is some sort of production mess-up.  I have not heard of anyone else having this same problem, either on here or elsewhere so I am willing try again with this same model.  
My warrenty ran out a while ago, but I may send it out for repair.  If I do I will write a review of the repair shop I have it done in.  But I just felt I should update this review to add this.  

I would love to hear from anyone who may have had a similar problem with the 800.
