            We purchased our second Cavalier shortly after our first child was born.  Being a stay at home parent, I worried about getting the baby to a doctor in the case of an emergency.  I have loved it ever since.  It was purchased in 1995 with about 14,000 miles on it. Since the car was a year old at the time of purchase, we paid less than $6,000 for it.  It still gets about 43 miles to the gallon when we go on cross country road trips, there is little upkeep other than standard oil changes, and it rides very well.  My kids love the roomy back seat.  This is a great family car even though it is only a two door.  Anyone who wants a cheap, but well made car, should check them out.  But not mine, I plan on driving mine until I hit the 200,00 mile mark on the odometer...<br><br>
