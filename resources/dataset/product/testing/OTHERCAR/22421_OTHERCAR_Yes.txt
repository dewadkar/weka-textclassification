            My brother and I have a 93 Toyota pickup. Aside from an old clunker, it is the first car we have had.  This standard transmission vehicle is a great choice for the college student.  It has a lot of foot room in the front and it even has enough room behind the seats to carry two skinny people.  It gets anywhere from 23 30 miles per gallon on the highway, and around 20 in town.  We bought this truck with 4,000 miles on it, and we have put about five thousand more on since we've had it.  We had to replace the clutch once, but I don't know if this has to do with the car's design or manual errors.  Basically this truck has been an efficient, mostly reliable, and relatively unexpensive tool for us.  The best part is that it is a truck that is like a car.  We have a nice comfortable driving vehicle and a good way to haul all of our junk back and forth between home and college.<br><br>
