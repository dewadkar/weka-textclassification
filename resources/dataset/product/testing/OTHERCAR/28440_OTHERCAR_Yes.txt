            I feel that toyota makes the best line of cars out there.  The Avalon is no exception.  It's like a cross between a camery and a lexus.  When I first found out that toyota and lexus are the same company, I wasn't surprised.  The Avalon is one of the most reliable cars out there.  Toyota also has one of the simplest engines which makes the repair costs very low.  It's is very classy and for such a low price I'm amazed that there aren't more on the road.  I think the world of autos should move over and let the Avalon take it for a spin.  The bottom line is this is a great car.<br><br>
