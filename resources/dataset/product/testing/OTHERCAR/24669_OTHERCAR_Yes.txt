            Let me start by saying, I've gotten a new car for what averages out to be every year.  This year, things have changed.

I became an official Mini Van Mom! A title I am so proud of!  I wanted a van for what seemed like an eternity and after looking for a very long time, my husband finally agreed the Venture was the van for us.

I'm sure you're asking, Why did it take so long for him to make up his mind?  Let me just counter act with a question of my own...Have you seen the prices on these Vans??  Every woman knows that husbands need some smooth talking to be convinced..of course bribery helps too! :)

I fell in love with my Venture from the time I test drove it!  We have the LS model, loaded up with extras.  (For price hunters like us, it's cheaper to buy it that way, and you can PICK what options you need.)  I have to say my favorite feature is the remote passenger door.  I used to think who in the world is so lazy they can't open a door?  If ever someone asks me that, my hand will be the first one to shoot high in the air!  This door has been the most convenient thing!  With a 1 1/2 year old it seems like my hands are always full:  Her, Her bag, My purse, Toys, Juice Cups, The list goes on and on.  With the handy remote control, the door opens and closes with a touch of a button!!!  You've GOTTA love that!!

The Venture also comes with a rear sliding door on the Driver side.  Having only one child of my own this hasn't come in that handy...YET!  As our family grows I feel it will be the 2nd best thing I've found on that van.

The Venture comes equipped with things like power windows, power locks, LOTS of cup holders (another HUGE plus in my book) and a lot of storage space.  The rear seats fold up and down easily for extra storage if needed.

All in all, this van has been incredibly reliable.  Outside of routine maintenance, we've had NO problems whatsoever.  

Even after all the cars I've had, this one is a KEEPER!! No more trading for me!

If you're van hunting...take the time to check out the Chevy Venture...it's well worth it!<br><br>
