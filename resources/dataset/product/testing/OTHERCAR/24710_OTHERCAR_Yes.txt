            I got this camera for Christmas, right after I got back from a long trip.  Before I went on the trip, I decided I wanted a digital camera, but I didnt know which one.  Also, I was torn between 3.5' floppys vs. memory sticks.  Although I left on the trip without one, many other people on the trip had digital cameras and they were able to tell me the good and bad points about digital cameras.  Eventually I decided to go with this one, a memory stick camera.

The memory stick holds a lot more pictures than a floppy disk can.  The camera comes with an 8MB memory stick, but I went and got a 32MB stick.  The 32 MB stick will hold about 400 pictures taken on the lowest resolution.  That (lowest resolution) may sound bad, but really, I find it good enough for my purposes.  The second lowest resolution (of about 5) is significantly bigger.  That pictures size is larger than the size of my computer screen.  Unless you are doing a professional job, or you are planning on using the picture as a screen saver, the lowest resolution should do fine.  These pictures take up maybe half the screen.  

The major advantage of having a digital camera is that you can see how your pictures turn out right away by looking at them on the screen.  If you dont like them, you can delete them and try again.  This is fun, and it can make you the center of attention. Otherwise, it allows you to take the best possible pictures.  The pictures you take appear on the LCD screen on the back of the camera.

This camera has a lot of features.  You can make MPG movies up to a minute long (according to the instruction book; the longest I have been able to make is 15 seconds.  You can take pictures in black and white or in brown and white, like a really old (100+ years) photograph.  You can also take them in reverse colors and in a "solarizing" light.  The camera allows you to vary the shutter speed and F stop.  If you dont know what that means, no problem.  Change it, take some pictures and see what it does.  Why not?  Thats the great part about a digital camera, you have nothing to lose and dont have to worry about wasting pictures.  The camera has 6x zoom, but only the first 4x is optical; the rest is digital.  The lens itself is a Carl Zeiss lens, one of the best in the world.  You can take time exposures and the camera has a timer in case you want to take a picture of yourself, but there is nobody around to do it for you.  The battery lasts on the high side of 2 to 2 and a half hours when fully charged.  

When you buy the camera, it comes with a bunch of accessories you will need.  It already mentioned the 8 MB memory stick.  It also comes with a battery, carrying strap, lenscap (though no strap to attach the lenscap to the camera), and cables to charge the camera's battery, hook it up to a USB port, and a cable to attach it to a TV.  I recommend that you buy a case to put the camera in; it does not come with one, and you will want to protect it.  In case you dont have a USB port, Sony makes an adapter that will let you put the memory stick into the adapter and then you can put the adapter into a 3.5' floppy disk drive.  convenient, but expensive (costs about twice as much as a USB port)

There are few things I dont like about the camera, though most of them are minor.  One is that it does not come with a case.  Second is the absence of a strap to attach the lenscap to the camera itself.  Third is that if you turn it on and the lenscap is on, you have to take it off and reboot, even if you take it off before the camera boots up.  Also, the cord that connects the camera to the USB port is extremely short; I can barely set the camera on top of my tower when the cord is being used.  Finally, when you take a picture, the camera does not take the picture exactly when you press down the button; you have to press it down most of the way, then if you press it far enough, it will take the picture when you press the button the rest of the way.  The only problem with this is that it is sensitive and only a lot of practice will train your finger to press it down the right amount before taking the picture.  So if you are trying to take a picture of a baseball player hitting a ball, you will only be successful if you have experience using the camera.  

This camera is totally awesome, and it is loaded with features.  I recommend one to anybody not going on a very long trip, unless you dont mind buying several memory cards (expensive!!).
