            My parents bought me a 1990 Geo Prizm to drive to college.  It was Autumn of 1989 when I got it.  My mom was unsure of the purchase, as Geos were brand-new that year, and you never know if new car-brands are going to last.

Well, it lasted and lasted and lasted.  It has never had any major mechanical problems.  The most annoying problem with it is that the driver-side window came off the track, and when my husband attempted to fix it, he completely ruined it.  Now, we are both too lazy and too poor to bother getting it fixed.

I drove this car to college and back (90 miles each way) about twice a month for 4 years.  My husband drives it to work now--more than 10 years later.

Unfortunately, I think it may be beginning to feel its age--cosmetically at least.  The fabric fell off of the interior roof, the driver-side window does not close all the way (as previously mentioned), and just last week, the inside passenger door handle broke off in my husband's hand.  We are considering buying another Prizm, because this one has served us so well.

Two other disadvantages of this car--the backseat is cramped for adult passengers, and the radio speakers blast out anyone in the back seat while at the same time, the people riding in the front can barely hear it.
