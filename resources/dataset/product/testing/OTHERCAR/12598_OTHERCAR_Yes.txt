            A few months ago, I gave in to my husband's constant demands for a digital camera.  He wanted one badly, I didn't want to fork over the cash, but I kind of wanted one too.  I put pictures up on my website a lot and I thought it would be an easier way to do it than scanning.  My husband wanted the Nikon Coolpix 800 at that time, because his friend had one.  

I started to do a little research and realized that to get a decent camera, we were going to have to spend about $500.  There are many for more or less, but less than that would not give us the quality of pictures we wanted, and more money was just too much money.  I came on epinions, and didn't like what I was reading about the Coolpix 800.  One review called the camera 'cheap-looking' and another cited it was too expensive by comparison.  

At this time I also was learning about the specs on digital cameras, and what we needed.  We would be using the camera mainly for family pictures and scenic pictures.  We won't be selling any photography, but I still wanted decent pictures. I figured out that we wanted at least 2 megapixels.  3 are better, but 2 is enough for us.  

My husband originally wanted a camera that allowed us to save the pictures right to a floppy disc, but with some research I convinced him this wasn't a good idea.  Use of a memory stick or compact flashcards would allow us to save many more pictures at once.

We also decided we needed a camera that used rechargeable batteries.  If our only choice was non-rechargeable batteries, we were going to spend more money on batteries than we would on film in an ordinary camera.

<b>Enter the Canon</b>
Once we decided on the specs, my husband spent a couple of days on the Internet and chose the Canon S10 or S20 as what we wanted.  I was still open, but thought the S10 sounded good, and the S20 was a little too expensive.  In Hawaii, everything is more expensive so we decided we would buy it on our upcoming trip to the mainland.  

When we got to Chicago, we went to some camera stores, a Best Buy, and a couple of other places but the cameras were very expensive compared to the prices we had seen on the web.  We decided to buy the camera on the Internet and have it shipped to our next stop.  

We bought the camera from egghead.com for just under $450, and we added a 32 MB Sandisk compact flash card for about $70.  Shipping was something like $6.00.  The camera was shipped on time and was waiting for us when we got to our next destination.  

It came with a regular (not rechargeable battery)  and an 8 MB compact flash card.  We opened the package and I spent about two hours going through the instructions and learning how to use the camera.  It has <b>tons</b> of features, and although two hours sounds like a long time, it wasn't too bad because I can basically remember how to do everything from that one session.  FYI, during these two hours, I completely drained the battery.

The camera is small and light.  It weighs a little more than a regular 35 mm camera, but not enough to make it a hindrance.  On the top of the camera is the dial that specifies what mode you are in, the button to take the pictures with, and a display panel that tells you how many pictures are left and details about your shot.

On the back of the camera (the side facing you when you take pictures) is the zoom button, a display button, the menu and set buttons, a white balance button, and the LCD monitor.  The LCD monitor shows what you would see through the lens.  It works well, except in bright light situations - then you have to shade it to see anything.

The camera takes pictures in four modes.  The first mode is an automatic mode that predefines the size of the pictures to large and fine.  Large means the pixels of the picture will be 1600x1200 and fine indicate a medium compression.  The second mode lets you define your own picture size.  I prefer to use this mode and shoot in middle and fine.  This gives me excellent pictures without using too much memory.  There are three size choices, and three compression choices total.  The third mode is the image mode that lets you take pictures specifying either a landscape, night, black and white, fast shutter, or slow shutter scene.  The fourth mode is the image stitch assist mode.  This is really neat.  It allows you to take many pictures of a wide area and stitch them together using software to make it look like one big picture.  For an example, go to my website here http://www.volcanoalley.com/feature/dolphin_lesson_plan/bay.html  That picture is actually 5 pictures stitched together.

With an 8 MB compact card, you can only take 4 pictures on the largest (large and superfine)  settings, but 61 pictures on the smallest settings (small and normal).  With a 32 MB card you can take only 20 pictures on the largest settings but 255 on the smallest.  I usually go with the medium settings and can take 75 at once.  For an example of a picture taken on medium settings go here  http://www.volcanoalley.com/103-0319_IMG.JPG Great quality I think, and the sky is colored exactly how it looked that night.  That thing that looks like the moon is actually a water droplet on the lens.

The camera allows you to view all the pictures you have already taken on the LCD monitor, and easily delete ones you don't like.  While we were on our trip to the mainland I took dozens of pictures of my little nephews trying to get that &quot;perfect picture&quot; and just deleted the ones I didn't like.  It was great! I could instantly see the results and not worry about wasting any film.

We found a power supply kit at Best Buy that had been returned for $50.  I think they normally cost a little over $100.  I consider this a necessity because it comes with a rechargeable battery, a battery charger, and the means to run your camera from an electrical outlet.  Besides that I also ordered one extra battery off the Internet for $35.  That brings the total price of the camera up to $610, but I now consider myself prepared for any scenario.  The rechargeable batteries last through about 80 pictures, more if you leave the display off - that is what eats up the batteries.

The software that came with the camera was Zoombrowser, Photorecord, Photostitch, and Adobe Photodeluxe.  Adobe Photodeluxe caused me to do a full restore, so we won't discuss that one (arrgh).  Zoombrowser is the utility that you can first download your images to - it is easy to use and fast.  We connect with a USB cable and 70 pictures transfer in less than 5 minutes.  You can look at them all and do minor adjustments in your pictures here.  Photostitch allows you to stitch the photos together easily, you just choose them and the software does the rest.  I haven't used Photorecord yet, but it lets you make digital photo albums.

<b>things I don't like</b>
1.  The camera's flash is not very powerful, so pictures at night may turn out too dark.  2.  The shutter button has a halfway point that is used to 'set' the light or something, but it often makes my husband think he has taken a picture when he hasn't.  3.  To preserve the battery life and keep from damaging the camera you are supposed to remove the battery when you are not using the camera for &quot;long periods of time&quot;.  This is a little bit of a hassle, because you can't get that 'surprise' shot easily, but it is probably standard for all digital cameras.  4.  The camera takes an extra half second to take the picture when compared to a regular camera.  This is also probably standard across digital cameras because my other digital does the same thing - but it makes it very difficult to get action shots.

Basically, this is a really good camera for the money.  I would classify it as low to moderate difficulty to use, moderate to high quality photos, moderate to high quality design, and give it 4 and 1/2 stars.  I'm still giving it 5 stars on the epinions scale, because two of my complaints with the camera are probably standard with all digital cameras in this price range.  I'm not a photography expert, but an average user and I think average users like me will be more than happy with it.<br><br>
