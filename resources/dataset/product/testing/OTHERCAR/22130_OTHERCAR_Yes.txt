            I wanted my first digital camera to be easy to use and not very expensive. After weeks of online research, all links pointed towards the Kodak DC 215. The difference between the normal DC215 and the Millennium edition is the 4 Mb extra RAM card and the USB Card reader which are bundled with the Millennium edition.

The camera is compact, no bigger than your average 35 MM camera, but does weigh more than your average camera. Use Ni-MH batteries and you'll be able to take more snaps before the low battery indicator raises its ugly head (faster if you use the LCD display to see snaps you are taking). The 2X optical zoom gives you a better image compared to the digital zoom that other cameras in this price range offer. 

If you do buy this camera, you'll do well to buy the AC adapter so you can plug it when you're downloading images instead of draining the batteries. And a battery charger if you don't have one.

The 8 Mb card is more than sufficient for normal usage and depending on the resolution and quality settings you can get upto 3 rolls of 35 MM images with one card.

Happy as I was, I did face a problem with my DC-215 - my 8 Mb card got corrupted within a month, and though the problem was with the card, the retailer took the entire unit back in March. The product is still on backorder now - hopefully I will get it this month (May)...

All in all, a great product, and an excellent buy.<br><br>
