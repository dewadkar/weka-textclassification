            So I'm almost done with high school and ready to have fun with my new freedom, why not have the ultimate freedom with a Jeep Wrangler.  The commercials on TV are right, it is the ultimate freedom machine except when it comes to paying for fuel (it could get better mileage).  Wranglers are fun, sporty and sexy in their own way.  When test driving this 1999 4.0L 5 speed manual transmission Sport model with the dual top option and Soundbar, I knew that this was my dream vehicle and I was done car shopping.  I bought it, brought it home and made my friends jealous.  There is only a few things that could change.  One thing is that a CD player should come standard on the Sport model.  The headlights could be made of plastic because a rock hit one of mine and it broke but it was under dealer warranty so it got fixed right away.  But a big bonus is the steel bumper.  I'm glad it steel because i was rear ended and the guy who hit me dented his car but my Wrangler triumphantly drove away a winner without a scratch!  What's really neat and rewarding is the respect from other Wrangler owners on the road, when we see each other the unspoken language of a friendly wave is all it takes to have a better day.
