            <i>Driving Impressions:</i>

<b>W</b>hile the Honda Prelude Type SH may feel a bit outdated inside, you can't complain about the excellent driving experience, well unless you are driving this car in a drag race. There is something almost magical about the Prelude's V-Tec engine and how it loves to rev without no fuss that makes it so much more entertaining than many 4-cylinder engines. Below 5,000 RPM the car is  relatively weak, but set the tachometer to red, and the engine explodes into action. This car is no race car (stock), its 0-60 times rival family sport sedans; not American muscle cars for 1999, and surely no exotics. This car is quite fast, however, especially for a car in its class and compared to many other Japanese sports cars of this time period. Response from the chassis is very crisp, and body roll is minimal, yet not at the expense of ride and comfort. 

<b>Engine & Transmission:</b> The 1999 Prelude Type SH comes with a 2.2 liter DOHC 4-cylinder V-Tec engine that produces a healthy 200 horsepower. A smooth shifting 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic is offered.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> is plain and disappointing, not very many amenities whatsoever. The seats are supportive and the ergonomics are good although. For the price that the 1999 Honda Prelude SH retailed for, the interior should have been much better equipped. The interior of the prelude gives the feeling of much cheaper automobile, especially with the dated dashboard. My '99 Honda Prelude did come with power everything, an optional sunroof, and quality cloth seating with plenty of support bolstering, but the final execution of this interior leaves much to be desired. Room is more than adequate up front, but kids only in the back!

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

The <b>exterior</b> is also relatively plain looking. The Prelude is not as plain as some cars in its class i.e. the Acura Integra, however compared to most performance cars in the 26,000 dollar category, this style is not up to par. I realize that style is not synonymous with quality, and is only approved from the eyes of the beholder, however I passionately feel that this style came into action about 10 years too late. The '99 Prelude's style would had been better suited for the 1980's or early 90s; certainly not left for the 1999 model year.

<i>Pricing:</i> 
      
The <b>price</b> of a 1999 Prelude SH is still very high for a used 4-cylinder powered performance car. A 1999 Prelude SH can set you back almost $19,000 in many cases. 

<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

The 1999 Prelude does boast some positive attributes, however I do not recommend this car unless a Prelude is an absolute must on your car shopping list. Due to very high used prices, the lack of competitive outright performance, a dated interior, etc., I recommend looking elsewhere.
