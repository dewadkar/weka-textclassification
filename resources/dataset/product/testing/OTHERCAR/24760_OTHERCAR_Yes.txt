            Olympus&#146 Camedia C 720 is the updated version of the popular Olympus C 700 Ultra Zoom digital camera and is targeted toward more advanced photographers who want a solid digital camera with a  broad range of manual and automatic exposure options, 3 megapixel resolution, compact size, and point and shoot simplicity.  Select the C 720&#146s Programmed Auto mode and you&#146ve got basic point-and-shoot simplicity for easy picture taking in a wide variety of shooting situations. Add Scene modes, My Mode, an all-glass f2.8-f3.4/40 to 320mm (35mm equivalent) zoom, full manual operation, digital ESP and spot metering, adjustable white balance, multi mode built in flash,  auto bracketing, exposure compensation, and Olympus&#146 TruePic technology, which optimizes image information (sharpness, contrast, and color saturation) captured by the CCD before the data is saved to card---excellent for creating sharp colorful low res email JPEGS---and you&#146ve got a very versatile and stylish digital camera in an affordable package that weighs less than twelve ounces. 

<b>Viewfinder/LCD</b> 

The C 720 features a high eyepoint an EVF (electronic viewfinder) essentially a smaller version of the 1.5-inch, TFT color LCD monitor. The C 720's EVF provides the same camera status and menu displays shown on the LCD. The EVF is active (on) whenever the camera is powered up. The C 720&#146s EVF&#146s refresh rate is a bit slow (obviously designed to save power and prolong battery life) and quickly moving objects or rapid panning will leave the camera trying to catch up, however the effect is not disconcerting or limiting and users will quickly get used to it 

The C 720's 1.5&#148 LCD screen is bright and sharp (users can toggle back and forth between the EVF and the LCD with the Display button). The LCD provides a detailed information/status readout that includes, exposure settings, f/stop, shutter speed, and exposure compensation adjustments. 
 
<b>Exposure</b> 

The C 720 offers an impressive array of exposure options including Program mode for point-and-shoot simplicity in most picture situations and easy-to-use Scene modes for fully automatic exposures optimized for specific shooting situations like Portrait, Landscape, Night-Low light, and Sports shots. The C 720&#146s advanced settings include aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual mode for more experienced photographers who want more exposure control. 

<i>Panorama Mode</i> 

Olympus digicams offer users the option to record panoramas, but only when using Olympus brand SM or xD cards. 

<i>My Mode</i> 

My Mode allows users to save custom or frequently used settings and access them easily and quickly through the Mode Dial. Four different sets of My Mode settings can be saved. 

<i>Exposure Compensation and Auto Exposure Bracketing</i> 

The C 720 offers photographers the option of biasing exposure +/-2 EV in 1/3 EV increments to compensate for tricky lighting situations. The Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) mode will automatically shoot successive exposures on either side of the initial exposure ensuring that you&#146ll get at least one "right-on" shot when getting the exposure just right is critical. 

<i>Metering</i> 

The C 720 provides two metering modes; Digital ESP metering measures light from multiple points within the image frame and intelligently evaluates exposure data to determine optimal settings. Spot metering bases exposure on a small area at the center of the frame, allowing photographers to bias exposure for he most important element in the composition. 

<i>White Balance</i> 

White balance settings include Auto, Daylight, Overcast, Tungsten, Daylight Fluorescent, Warm White Fluorescent, Cool White Fluorescent, and Custom. 

<i>Sensitivity</i> 

The C720 provides Auto, 100, 200, and 400 ISO (equivalent) settings, an acceptable range of CCD sensitivity options. 

<b>OPTICS & FOCUS</b> 

<i>Lens</i> 

The heart of the C 720 is the all glass 8X f2.8-f3.4/40 to 320mm (35mm equivalent) zoom. The lens is a relatively fast with an incredibly wide range that allows the camera to be used for shooting sports, wildlife, concerts, auto racing, and anything else that requires an extremely long reach. Macro minimum close focus distance is 3.9 inches.  The C 720&#146s monster zoom provides a threaded mount that allows the use (with a proprietary Olympus adaptor) of conversion lenses and filters. 

<i>Auto Focus</i> 

The C 720 utilizes a TTL (through the lens) contrast detection AF (autofocus) system. The C 720&#146s AF speed ranges from fairly quick to slow (in low light), but it is consistently accurate. The C 720&#146s 8X zoom is large and complex, so it obviously  won&#146t focus as rapidly as a shorter less complex lens. AF speed issues are going to come up most often in low light situations. The lens is surprisingly quick (for an 8X zoom) when the light is good. 

<i>Manual Focus</i> 

The C 720 provides a manual focus option. It&#146s neither fast nor convenient, but it is functional.

<i>Macro Focus</i>

As close as 3.9 inches 

<b>FLASH</b> 

The C 720&#146s on-board multi mode (Off, Auto, Red-Eye Reduction, Slow shutter sync, & Fill Flash) pop-up flash is unusually versatile with plenty of power and range for most shooting situations.  There is no provision for external flash units.

<b>Controls, Design, & Ergonomics</b> 

The C 720 is a compact lightweight digital camera, a bit too large for dropping in a pocket but the camera fits easily in a backpack, fanny pack, or purse. The controls are well laid out, the 4-way selector switch is used to navigate menus, change shutter speed, and adjust aperture or exposure compensation settings. The OK button activates the onscreen menus and enables the manual focus option. Like all Olympus digital cameras the C 720 is menu driven, but the menus are logical and relatively quick once users gain familiarity with the camera. 

<b>Power</b> 

Four AA or two CR-V3 batteries. The C 720&#146s power management is excellent. Even with an EVF, menu driven operation, a powerful flash, and the 8X zoom,  the C 720 makes its batteries last, 300 plus shots with continuous LCD use and occasional flash.

<b>In the Field/Handling & Operation</b> 

My friend (who sells digital and analog cameras and photo equipment) and I have been testing a lot of new Olympus digital cameras over the past few months.  The folks at Olympus have been really busy introducing nifty new digicams like the incredible C 4000, the tiny five megapixel C 50, and the semi pro five megapixel C 5050.  They&#146ve also introduced a couple of entry-level charmers like the D 550, C 730, and the C 720. 

We got together to test the C 720 on the prettiest day we&#146ve had in two months.  Blue skies with no cloud cover at all and temperatures in the mid sixties, it was positively balmy after the past month of bone chilling cold. We were looking for signs of spring, but we didn&#146t find any. Even Cherokee Park, one of our favorite outdoor photography venues was pretty depressing.  We spent about an hour in Cherokee Park shooting some very dull mid winter scenes under bright light and blue skies.  Both of us have been suffering from the flu so we quickly called it a day and headed for home.  By the following day the weather turned gray and dismal once again.  We shot some basic color tests (using brightly colored plastic toys) with a homemade close-up set, tripod mounted C 720, and a simple softbox overhead light. The C 720&#146s color was very good&#151well saturated and accurate (just a tiny bit warm)

My friend dropped by the following Saturday morning with two  tickets to &#147Carl Casper&#146s Custom Auto Show&#148 at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center.  He&#146d actually gotten up early that morning to shoot the Belle of Louisville.  The day dawned with a thick fog and my friend wanted to shoot the Belle isolated in the thick fog and make it look like the old sternwheeler was pulled up somewhere to sit out the fog.  The images had a gauzy old fashioned look, but the colors were bright and the old steamer looked great. 

Carl Casper&#146s Custom Auto Show is one of the ways Kentuckians fight the mid winter blahs.  When the sky outside is gray and the street edges are packed tight with dirty brown snow, the folks in Louisville head for the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center to look at candy apple red road rockets and dream of the romance of the open road with the wind at your back, a powerful V8 under the hood, and a gorgeous babe riding shotgun.

The hot rods and custom cars created by Carl Casper (along with George Barris and Ed &#147Big Daddy Roth) helped to inspire the muscle cars of the sixties.  The Pontiac GTO, the Plymouth Road Runner, and the Shelby GT350 Mustang all owe a debt to Casper, Barris, and Roth. Casper has designed and built custom autos for the Movies (the Batmobile for the 1989 Tim Burton &#147Batman&#148 film and the 1966 GTO from &#147XXX&#148) and television (K.I.T.T. from &#147Knight Rider&#148, the &#147A Team&#148 van, and the General Lee from &#147The Dukes of Hazzard&#148) Casper stores his massive collection of historic custom cars in the Louisville area and the annual show here is the last of its kind.  What I really wanted to see the was the 1966 &#147custom&#148 GTO from the Vin Diesel action flick &#147XXX&#148.  I owned a 1965 GTO so I&#146ve always had a soft spot for Pontiac&#146s potent &#147goat&#148 muscle cars.  The &#147XXX&#148 GTO was a real treat to see up close and I got to spend the afternoon teasing my friend about how disappointing it was that we were going to miss seeing Vern Troyer (Mini Me) from the Austin Powers movies in person.

This is the second time we&#146ve tested a digital camera at the car show, which is pretty neat since dazzling chrome, colorfully painted custom cars, historic motorcycles, and classic lowriders beat frigid cold, dirty snow, and dismal mid winter skies hands down.  There were more than 600 cars, dozens of Harley-Davidson bikes, and thousands of people so we had plenty to take pictures of.  We brought our friend Ivan along.  Ivan is originally from Belarus (formerly a part of the Soviet Union) and this was his first car show.  He was absolutely amazed by the lowriders, which he called &#147the crazy jumping cars&#148.  The C720 performed like a champ easily compensating for the mega watt fluorescent lighting. 

After we finished at the car show we stopped at the world famous <b>Bambi Bar</b> a popular East End watering hole on Bardstown Road to grab a cheeseburger and review the images we&#146d shot. The Bambi Bar is one of Louisville&#146s neatest neighborhood bars, with good food, incredibly cramped pool (only for the double jointed), and an incredible cast of local characters. This funky little bar has been a Highlands neighborhood favorite since it opened in 1940. 

<b>A Few Concerns</b> 
 
Overall image quality is excellent, however the C 720 exhibits some chromatic aberration (purple fringing) in scenes with strong backlighting.  The camera shows slightly above average image noise in low light/long exposure images. Pixel mapping, noise reduction, and post exposure image manipulation should eliminate most of this problem. I don&#146t like EVF&#146s (electronic viewfinder) because it is hard to tell if the image is really in sharp focus on the tiny screens, however the C 720&#146s EVF is clear and bright (except in very low light---where it is virtually useless). You&#146ll need to use the LCD for critical focus. 

 
<b>Shutter Lag/Timing</b> 

Shutter lag and AF lag with C 720 range from about average to a bit slower than average. The startup cycle is slow (not surprisingly, considering the 8X zoom) and shot to shot timing is about two seconds. The C 720&#146s autofocus speed is about average for long-zoom cameras. Write to card times are about average, except for TIFF images, which are fairly slow. If you want to use the C 720&#146s 8X zoom to shoot action you&#146ll need to practice pre-focusing and learn to lead the peak action by about half a second. 

<b>Image Quality</b> 

The C 720 consistently produced very good to excellent quality images with accurate color under virtually all shooting conditions. The C 720's auto white balance setting is accurate, but the overall look is a tiny bit warm. Skin tones are handled very well and portraits look natural. The C 720&#146s images are equal or superior to most currently available three megapixel consumer digital cameras. We printed one 8X10 image of the Belle of Louisville isolated in dense fog, a really difficult image, but the C 720 did an exceptional job of wringing every bit of color and detail out of an image that could have easily been lost.  We printed the enlargement with an Epson 785EPX printer on Kodak photo paper. 
 
<b>Conclusion</b> 

The C 720 is a compact digital camera that&#146s loaded with serious manual features but can also be easily used by point and shooters.  The C 720 will produce excellent photo-quality prints up to 8x10" the camera&#146s indoor flash pictures are some of the best I&#146ve seen to date, people look very natural.  My friend and I were both impressed with the Olympus C 720, the camera fills a niche that no other manufacturer has adequately addressed, and so I&#146m willing to bet it will do quite well in the marketplace. If you are looking for excellent image quality, a long range zoom, manual features, point and shoot ease of use, and an affordable price then the C 720 may be the digital camera you&#146ve been waiting for.
