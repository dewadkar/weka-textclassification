            This camera is a good deal at $100 or less.
The best $150 camera is probably the Fuji Finepix 2650.

In any case, the camera has a lot of limitations.

The battery life for this is very short, regardless of using a rechargeable battery or not. It does last longer with NiMh batteries, but overall, I find it unacceptable.

It is stupid, at least when it comes to lighting. The camera cannot decide whether flash is appropriate for a particular shot given ambient light. This can be corrected, but you need to be familiar with the concepts of cameras and light. In fact, the only time the flash does well is in outdoor shots, to compensate for slight shadows. This is a very tricky camera to use indoors, especially with overhead flourescent lights. So, its not that user friendly.

The flash is disappointing and you will find many pictures work a lot better with the flash off. It does a good job of gathering available light, but you have to keep the camera absolutely still when taking shots without flash, otherwise they come out blurry. 

The LCD display is inaccurate, or more so than with other cameras. You cannot be sure whether you have a good shot or if you should retake it. Other camera displays reproduce the image a little more accurately. The good news is that your pictures come out better than what you feared the LCD showed. It takes some practice translating what the LCD is trying to tell you, so for forcing the user to toy with it, I mark the camera down.

The camera does video and sound, but it does so in .mpg with lower quality. Canon S230, for example, does video and sound, but with much better quality. It records in .avi.
The nice thing is that it uses SD (secure digital) which is small and faster than Compact Flash, so when you start using cards approaching 256MB, you can write and retrieve a lot faster.

Zoom. I don't believe in zoom at all, so the lack of an optical zoom doesn't matter to me. The dumb thing though, is that HP pretends its 5x digital zoom will sway anyone. Unlikely. Again, the Fuji Finepix is also $150, has better battery life and comes with 2x optical zoom.


Nice things about the camera:

Size and styling- the camera looks sleek and metallic (although its made of plastic, but feels solid). It's light and pretty small, I carried it around in my pocket, but a Minolta Dimage Xi or Xt is definitely smaller, a Canon S230 is also smaller. This camera is rectangular.

Operation - some think its annoying, I found it a little cool, that you slide the cover to turn on the camera. I felt like a spy using the camera. Load time is decent, but the flash takes a few more seconds to charge. Screw the flash :-)


Overall:

If you don't look for deals, and are content with an average camera, this is one for you. At $150, I can't say it is a rip off, but at the same time, I cannot highly recommend it either. A 2megapixel camera takes better pictures than this so-called "3 megapixel camera". If you manage to snag it at $100, then I would change my position and say its a nice deal.
