            Minivans have an unfair aura about them - that they smack of suburbia and conformity.  While that may be (at least in the eyes of some) they are extraordinarily convenient vehicles.

The Grand Voyager's dual sliding doors was the clincher for me when I purchased my 1996 edition.  And not just the door, but the way the door catches when open to keep it from accidentally sliding forward.  That feature alone is worth getting the car.

The main complaint I have is road noise.  I really think a car that costs this much should be a little quieter.  While you don't necessarily hear the guy next to you at a stop signal, the drone of the road while driving is a dull roar that makes it a little difficult for conversation and forces you to turn up the radio louder.  Add to that the noise of the air system, and you often have to raise your voice to be heard in the back.

On the other hand, the tinted windows (which came with my version), are great.  I hate night glare and this helps cut down on that.  

My version did not have some standard &quot;extras&quot; like rear cargo netting or luggage rack (which I think for a car like this should be standard).  That was a small minus.

Later I realized that there really isn't any sort of light on the back cargo hatch, making it difficult at times to insert your key into the lock - especially at night.  I also didn't like the lack of door lock for the back hatch.  On my Ford Escort there is a door lock which you can depress before closing the door.  That's a little more convenient than having to reinsert your key and lock the Voyager's hatch.

Another small complaint is the clearance under the seat.  The wires controlling the seat position and the release catches get in the way at times when shoving 2x4s under the seat.  Of course, you can easily take a handful of 8-foot 2x4s home with you from Home Depot without having to strap it onto your roof.  In fact, I have carted home quite a bit of home building materials with no trouble.  

The ride is generally comfortable, and maintenance has been okay.  I've been told that the water pump in this model is substandard quality and tends to go out after a few years.  I've discovered that recently and it cost me $225.  The explanation I got was that there's always something in these models that is quite up to par.  In the 1996 Grand Voyager it just happens to be the water pump.

This car is definitely for families.  Very convenient, and fairly comfortable on long rides (1000 miles).  Don't use it for a lot of trips to Home Depot.  It's not a pick-up truck, after all.  But it does provide carrying space for the occasional home do-it-yourselfer.

I put a question mark in Amount Paid because it would take an accountant to figure out the final price of my car.  I think the sticker was $20K, or thereabouts, but, boy, that's not what I'll end up paying.  I'm a lousy car buyer and I'm certain they saw me coming.  But that's the last time I buy from that dealership - and they know it.<br><br>
