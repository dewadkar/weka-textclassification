            I traded my 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 in for the 2004 Toyota Matrix XR. Both are considered <i>crossover</i> vehicles (crossover between a car and an SUV). I love my Matrix, although sometimes I wish I had purchased the XRS with manual transmission. The XRS has the "lift" (when you hit around 5000 RPM on the XRS, you get a boost of around 40 HP; feels a little like turbo). Aside from the extra cost, the XRS requires premium fuel which led me to get the more practical XR.

<b>ROOM</b>
The Matrix has a lot of room. 5 people can comfortable ride in the Matrix. There is plenty of space in the rear for cargo. If more cargo room is needed, the rear seats fold flat, and you can put a ton of stuff back there. I've moved twice since purchasing this car, and everyone's amazed how much I can pack into this car.

<b>PEP</b>
The engine is quite peppy. For most city and highway driving, I have no complaints. Every now and then, I wish that I had the XRS, but I'm quite happy with my XR. If you take the XRS for a test drive, be sure to really step on the gas. You'll feel the "lift" at around 4000-5000 RPM. You gotta really step on it to feel the boost.

<b>SHIFT</b>
The transmission is very smooth and it is very responsive to the driver. It shifts up with minimal hesitation, and given some gas, it downshifts quickly to give you more power. Like many cars with 4 cylinders, the car seems sluggish when going uphill or when driving with a lot of cargo, so you might want to manually downshift to 1st or 2nd or 3rd gear (turning the overdrive off disables the car from going to 4th gear, so you stay at 3rd gear of lower).

<b>FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT</b>
Driving the Matrix is a joy. From the first time I sat on the driver's seat to test drive this car, I loved driving it. Everything is geared for the driver's comfort, from the instrument panel to the stereo controls and the climate controls: they all point towards the driver and everything is within comfortable reach. There is a lot of glass surrounding the driver's seat for optimal vision. And the car handles pretty well despite it being proportionally taller than most cars. I went up and down the Big Bear mountains in California (very hilly and curvy), and I was able to go quickly around most bends. The large tires (I have 16" ones; 17" ones are optional) and the stable suspension helped the Matrix hug the road pretty well. However, this isn't a sports car and you can't take be cornering like this is a Porsche.

<b>COMFORT</b>
The front and rear seats are very comfortable, much more comfortable than those of the Focus and most cars this size. I sometime take little naps in the car (no, not while I'm driving), and I can sleep on the driver's seat with the seat tilted back, or I can go to the back seat and sleep lying down. Both are very comfortable. If you're used to the Camry or the Accord, then the Matrix will seem quite cramped. But compared to cars it its size category (Focus, Civic, PT Cruiser, Forester, etc.), the Matrix feels very roomy.

<b>STOP</b>
The Matrix, like my previous Focus, has excellent brakes. It stops the car on a dime. There have been a couple times when I thought I was going to hit the car in front of me, and the brakes surprised me and stopped me in time.

<b>EFFICIENCY</b>
For the first 10,000 miles, I kept a log of how much I spent on gas.  I do about 50/50 city and highway driving, and living in southern California, I do a lot of stop and go.  Plus I usually go 75-85 MPH on the freeways (not good for gas mileage).  I've averaged 29 miles per gallon.

<b>NIFTY FEATURES</b>
The Matrix XR comes with an AC outlet which is quite handy. When I went camping in Utah, the AC outlet proved to be especially useful (charging digital camera battery, using the notebook computer, etc.). The trunk has nets for groceries, another nifty feature. Another pretty cool feature is the digital data reception of the FM radio: you can tell what song is playing and who the artist is (this is a service by the radio stations, so not all stations will display this info). In addition, there is a reminder light for driver seat belt as well as passenger seat belt. The passenger's light works via a weight sensor--pretty cool.

<b>COUPLE COMPLAINTS</b>
The Matrix comes with daytime running lights. While it is a good safety feature, I wish that there was a way to disable it with a switch for those times when I want no lights turned on (the Camry has a switch to enable/disable DRL).  Another annoying safety feature is the moonroof. When you press to close the moonroof, it stops at the halfway point. You then have to release then re-press the close button to close the moonroof completely. It is to prevent accidentally closing the moonroof on someone, but it is quite annoying.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
Overall, I'm very happy with my car. It's roomy, it's peppy, and I feel very at home in my Matrix. It drives smoothly, and everything about it screams comfort. Hope you find such comfort in your Matrix.
