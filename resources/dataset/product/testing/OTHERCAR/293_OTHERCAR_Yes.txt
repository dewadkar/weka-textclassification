            We purchased this car new in 1995. At the time, we also considered the Honda Civic, Geo (Chevrolet) Prizm and the Dodge Neon. We couldn't help but be impressed. (I'm resisting the urge to replace my s's with z's!) The torque of the flat-4 engine, excellent handling, and overall fit and finish were the biggest selling points.

Now it's over 175,000 miles later, and I'm so happy that we made such a good buying decision. This car still has the original alternator, starter, water pump, air conditioning components, you name it. Nothing to do with the engine or the accessories connected to it has ever broken. Also, never a problem with the automatic transmission.

Okay, it's not perfect! I did have to replace the right axle, and it's now in need of a steering rack. Also, the gas gauge no longer works. I have replaced the battery once, and have kept up with most regular maintenance, including timing belt replacement.

I have been exceptionally pleased with the brake wear. The front pads lasted over 100,000 miles, and the rear shoes were just replaced recently. They actually were not completely gone, but were getting a little noisy. (Yes, dear domestic SUV owners, this is a true story!)

The materials used in the interior are not of the highest quality, especially the carpet. It's just a thin, low-grade material. Some of the interior plastic pieces have also discolored. From what I can tell, the newer Subaru products are improving in this area.

I think it's the little things that have kept Subaru from reaching the sales levels of Toyota and Honda. But as far as mechanicals, I would rate the Subaru as superior to even these brands.

I've owned both Toyota and Honda, and I'm also a service advisor by profession. (No, not at a Subaru dealership --  Those guys are probably starving!) Subaru products are for the discriminating buyer, who isn't swayed by cushy interiors and trendy styling.

I believe that the durability of the Impreza may also be due to the fact that it is a Japanese built car, made for the international market. Unlike the Legacy, which is essentially a "purpose built" car for the American market. I'm not knocking the Legacy, but I have seen more problems with the American made vehicles, even in the Subaru line.

I don't mean to step on any toes with the above statement, but for example, in the Toyota world, those "in the know" would definitely choose a Japanese built Camry over an American one. We don't often admit that publicly, but it's the truth.

Another cool thing is the all-wheel drive system. It's dirt dependable, and can be a life saver, even if you live in an area where it's not an essential feature. Although you'll probably read somewhere that it doesn't make any difference outside of slick road conditions, the truth is that is does make a difference if you do any spirited driving, especially in tight turns on back roads.

Well, I'm going back to figuring out how to save up the money for a new 2003 (re-styled) Subaru Forester!
