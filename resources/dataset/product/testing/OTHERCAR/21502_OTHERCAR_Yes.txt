                I'm 22, male, and my 2000 Golf GL is my first car ever.  See the picture? That's the one I own.  (The caption says it's a Golf TDI GLS, but that's an error.  The car in the picture has only two doors!)
    I must admit: before getting my Golf, I knew nothing about cars.  I couldn't tell anyone the difference between ABS and SRS.  I bought this car practically overnight!  
    Now, two months down the road, I read avidly about cars.  Actually, I'm becoming a sort of automotive enthusiast.  My Dream Car is the 2000 Audi TT, which is built on the same platform as the Golf.  (Karmen Ghia 2K!)  But the question remains.  Do I still like my Golf?  The answer: yes, but I wish I had some time to think about it first, and find out what kind of car owner I actually am.  
    I've had an unexplainable penchant for VWs for a while.  VW know their demographic really well.  So I test drove no other makes.  When I went to the local VW dealership and drove the Golf, I was loving it. 
    This is why bought this car: the New Golf looks better than ever.  It's chunkier, funkier, and the dashboard is a virtual discotech.    I have a black car with a black cloth interior (I hate the designs on the cloth, though), so the dashboard takes center stage at night.  And the chrome accents are fantastic.  Whoever digs wood trim, I have to ask, &quot;Why?&quot;  I really liked the way the Golf GL handled, too.  I'm a novice driver, I haven't driven for four years straight, so factors such as horsepower and torque didn't matter too much.  Most of all, I liked the way I felt in it. 
     Now that I've driven around quite a bit, some of the novelty has worn off.  Except of course the dashboard lights.  I still think the New Golf is an attractive car.  With the GTI and the New Beetle, they're among the more attractive hatchbacks available today.  I mean, look at the Suzuki Swifts and Ford Aspires.  (Yech.)  
    But driving it has remained fun.  I drive an automatic, which is great for city and suburban driving, but I feel it struggle when I'm going up steep grades on the freeway.  But centrifugal forces don't exist when you make sharp emergency turns or U-turns.   I'm sure the manual transmission is more responsive and the VR6 would solve the performance quirks.  If this is your main concern, save your pennies, sell an internal organ, and get the GTI GLX.  
    Not having power windows and a moonroof is my pet peeve of the moment.  You have to get the Golf GLS to get power windows, and the luxury option for the GLS to get the moonroof and the heaven-sent alloy wheels.  I was gonna wait three months and order a silver Golf GLS, but I needed a car pronto.  Last month's pet peeve was the cup holders.  I guess they only drink espressos in Europe--they're too small and awkwardly placed.  Oh, and the stock stereo isn't so bad.  I read all these reviews trashing it, but I've heard stock stereos that sound much worse.  I'm a music snob, so I complain much more about what music people listen to than the stereos themselves.  Besides, a friend of mine has a '95 Jetta, and the stock stereo in that car just plain stinks.  The stereos in these new VWs are much better than before.  The brakes are touchy, and the brake and gas pedals are placed too close together.
      But now that I know my needs as a driver much better, I would've gone for the Jetta.  And I would've gone for a lease, not a purchase.  I know for a fact that I'm trading in my car after five years.  I like hatchbacks, but I realize now that I want a more sophisticated, snobby-looking ride and more rear passenger space. So if you've found you're turning into a neo-yuppie, like me, get the Jetta.  Keep in mind: cruising to 70's-era art punk in a Jetta does nothing for anyone's credibility. However, doing it in a Golf is the pinnacle of twentysomething hipness.  (One of the guys in Pavement, during high school, cruised around in his VW Rabbit listening to the Smiths.  How cool is that?)
    If you still can't decide between a Golf and a Jetta (which is the sedan version of the Golf), here's a simple quiz.  Get a Golf if you: wear Adidas soccer shoes, hate parallel parking, and still voluntarily shop at the Salvation Army.  But get a Jetta if you: have more than three friends, browse through J Crew catalogs, and are on the less popular side of 35.  (And if you're over 35 and still want a Golf, get a GTI GLX instead.) 
   All of the above, except for the age thing, applies to me.  But after all of this, I'm happy enough with my Golf GL.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.

   Update: This Christmas, the family SUV broke down (turned out to be a little problem and covered by the warranty anyway, go Honda!), and my family members had to pack into my 2 door Golf for a three hour drive.  I'm 5'10&quot;, and the rest of my family average 5'5&quot;.  And all of us, albeit the driver, experienced some back pain and stiff necks days after.  It's roomy for two adult passengers alone--and the trunk fit all of the presents--but all of us had something to complain about.  But the comments on how cute and &quot;euro&quot; the car was from other family members did not cease.
