            My first experience with the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> digital camera was over two years ago when my husbands step father purchased one.  Just two days after borrowing the camera, I was in <I>Wal-mart</I> purchasing one for myself.  Two years later, I still recommend the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> to my friends and family.


<b>What Comes With The Polaroid PDC-640?</b>

In addition to the camera, you will find a kit that is included.  The kit will consist of:

�  Software installation with Photo Fantasy cd
�  Detailed manual 
�  AC adapter to use for uploading photos to computer
�  TV video cable that will allow you to view photos on your television
�  Serial cable
�  2 MB memory card
�  Black band that attaches to the camera for easy handling
�  Soft black carrying case with a velcro closure
�  4 AA batteries 


<b>Installation</b>

Installing the software took me less than 10 minutes when I was using Windows version 98 on a Compaq computer.  Immediately after inserting the disc into my computer, the program was installed for me.  

Recently I purchased a new Hewlett Packard computer that runs Windows version XP.  I had been told that some of the older software programs would not be compatible with the new Windows XP so I expected trouble.  Just as I had been warned, the program was not compatible so I found myself on the phone calling <I>Polaroid</I> customer service.  Greeted with courtesy, I was directed to a web page to download a Twain driver.  The representative assisted me with each step and in no time my software was functioning properly.

In addition, the manual provides a diagram showing the owner where to plug each cord and offers trouble shooting tips as well.


<b>Appearance</b>

This camera is silver and black in color.  The classy appearance will lead your family and friends to believe it is much more expensive than it really is.  The camera is a bit heavier than some that I have come in contact with but that is only a small con considering all the pro�s this camera has to offer.


<b>Picture Quality</b>

Regardless if you are a professional or amateur, one of the most important features you 
look for when selecting a camera is picture quality.  The picture quality that the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> offers is superior.  There are three settings located on the back side of the camera that allow you to switch between outside photos, close up photos and distant photos.  This feature enables you to get the best possible picture with the various conditions.  

In addition this camera comes with four different resolution possibilities.  Stars are seen in the information display to indicate which resolution you are using.  With a 2MB memory card you will receive the following:

*       Low Resolution  320 x 480  allowing 96 images
**     Medium Resolution  640 x 480  allowing 36 images
***   High Resolution  640 x 480  allowing 24 images
**** Super High Resolution  640 x 480  allowing 12 images

You can also purchase an additional <I>Smartmedia</I> memory card.  The company states that the largest card that is compatible with the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> is the 8MB.  I currently use the 8MB memory card in my camera and it offers me 330 pictures with one star, 142 with two, 90 with three and 45 with the best possible resolution of four stars.

Using a Hewlett Packard printer with Kodak picture gloss picture paper I find that smaller images print more clear.  I have many photos in my home framed that were taken with my <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> digital camera that are 5 x 7 and unless you get right on top of them and hold them close you do not realize they are not actual photos.  If you look close enough you will find that the picture presents a fuzzy appearance, but most of the time no one even notices the imperfection.


<b>The Photo Fantasy Software</b>

The software <I>Photo Fantasy</I> will allow you to maximize your fun with your <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> digital camera.  You can edit your pictures to suit your preference and enjoy putting the faces of your family and friends into magazine covers of weight lifters, models and more.  This software is simple to operate and entertaining too.


<b>Bonus Features</b>

There are some features that attracted me to this camera and have allowed me to recognize it as a winner in my book.  The camera has a window located on the back side that will allow you instantaneous viewing of the photos you take.  You do not have to wait till you upload the photos to decide if you like the photo and need a re-take.  What better feature could a camera offer?  Well what about those who have a difficult time looking through the viewfinder?  Wouldn�t it be nice if with the touch of a button they could look at the 1.8 inch window on the back to focus on the object/persons first?  An elderly person who needs their glasses on at all times might benefit from this feature.  However, be forewarned this feature will drain batteries quickly.

Also the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> comes complete with the following:

�  tripod mountable
�  self timer
�  red-eye reduction
�  date & time 
�  ability to change language for owner


<b>How Easy Is This Digital Camera To Use?</b>

This is the first and only digital camera I have ever owned.  From the first time I used the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> I have had no difficulty learning the functions and how to operate them.  The manual can answer your questions and if you still find yourself in need of assistance you can visit their site at www.polaroid.com or contact them via phone at 1-800-343-5000.


<b>The Price Tag</b>

When I purchased my <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> it was fairly new to the market.  I paid approximately $130 for it at my local <I>Super Wal-mart</I> over two years ago.  Considering this camera has been out on the market for a while now the price has dropped and you will find the cost to be lower.


<b>Warranty</b>

<i>Polaroid</i> offers a one year warranty on the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b>.  I have never had to return my camera for any repairs or replacement thankfully.


<b> Availability </b>

Unfortunately I called <I>Polaroid</I> today and was informed that the company no longer manufactures digital cameras.  No, not just this model but all digital cameras.  The 
representative informed me that they dropped out of the digital market this past summer (2001) because it was too competitive.  He did say that there are some dealers that still carry their digital cameras but the company has discontinued making any new digital cameras.  In further questioning, I asked what about someone who buys a camera now and how would their warranty be affected by their cease of making new digital cameras.  He responded that the company will still maintain repair facilities for a minimum of one more year.  


<b>Two Years Later</b>

I have owned my <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> digital camera for over two years now and I am still impressed.  Actually I am disappointed to learn that <I>Polaroid</I> will no longer be making digital cameras, including the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b>.  I hope that in a few years to come the management will reconsider and return to the digital market once again.

While the company has discontinued making digital cameras you can still locate them and considering them price and quality, I hope that you would at least think about this camera as an option.
