            I had a Digital Camera that I had been having a great deal of fun with on vacation!  This camera, the Sony Mavica MVC-FD83, came to me completely as a fluke and I can't tell you enough how lucky I feel that this happened.  The ease of viewing the shot you are after, and being able to pop a floppy disk in and shoot, are enough to sell anyone.  
My previous camera had a cell!  Everyone on vacation with me had to wait until I got home, attached the necessary cables, uploaded the pictures, edited them and then sent them email!  The Mavica MVC-FD83 is great!  If someone likes the shots I have taken and would like a copy, I just pop in a floppy, copy the pictures to the disk and hand it to them!  They get to edit them to their liking!  The few drawbacks are that if you are a shutter bug like me, you will need a good supply of floppies with you at all times!  Also, the battery life is only about 90 minutes when fully charged!  The remedy...A box of floppies and an extra battery!!!  I have never been unhappy with any Sony product, and I have owned many in the past.  The FD83 continues to keep me bragging!  The name Sony to me says top of the line.
I am glad I have the opportunity to voice my opinions on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a digital camera!    <br><br>
