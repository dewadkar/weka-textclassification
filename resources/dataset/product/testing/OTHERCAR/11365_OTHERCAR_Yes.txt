            This is my first review and also a very important one!  We love our van!  My wife and I leased ours to see if this was the car for us, rather than to purchase and not like it.   It has turned out that this was a good choice.  Our van is so easy to use, so spacious and economical that we bought our lease out and will keep it!

Our first Minivan experience was with the Pontiac Transport.  We really liked having a minivan and this was even before children.  We decided to look into the Dodge and we have been happy ever since.  We originally leased our van as we weren't sure if this was going to be the one for us.  I found my van 180 miles away and made all purchase deals over the phone.  This dealership had the highest selling numbers for the Caravan in the state of Michigan and they were cutting deals that no dealer near us would touch.  So I can say I bought mine sight unseen.  

We have 2 children and an extremely large dog.  The 4 doors make life simple with getting everybody in and out.  I can easily take out the middle seat and get the kids in and out of the 3rd row.  (Our dog is 140lbs and needs some maneuvering space)  We have the Sport pkg on ours.  I really enjoy the universal body color and rear spoiler.  It sets the sportyness to the van.  We live in a rural setting and the fog lamps help with night driving.  

My wife is not very tall and she loves that she can see every angle without blind spots. She can reach the pedals without any difficulty and I can move the seat all the way back and not be cramped.  The passenger front seat also has plenty of leg room.  

The heater/air conditioner does a decent job of keeping comfortable temperatures without having the additional rear heat/ac.  I really don't think it is necessary, especially with tinted windows.   If you find a used one with rear heat/ac, go for it if you really want that, but again I don't believe this should keep you from buying a good car if you come upon one. 

I love the wiperblade defrost on the windshield.  This is connected to your rear window defrost and keeps your blades from icing up in winter.  This is a great feature as we live in West Michigan where snow is heavy.

We have 67000 miles on our van already (we live a distance from work) and we have had to do only routine maintenance to our van.  Brakes were just done and tires to come in the spring.  My only wish is that the warranty was as long as some of the new cars coming out now are....

This is a great van and a great value.  If you are considering purchasing a minivan, get the Dodge Caravan.  The Grand Caravan is the best choice if you have family as the extra storage is a must!
