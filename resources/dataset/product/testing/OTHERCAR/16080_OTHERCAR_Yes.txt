            The 2000 Grand Cherokee Limited offers little over the 1999 edition but either is one of the finest overall driving vehicles built today.  There are many stories regarding the quality and durability of the Jeep products, but engineering had truly created one of the best &quot;driving&quot; vehicles of the recent past.

The Jeep Grand Cherokee offers great comfort and visibility in today's sport UT market.  It is large enough to feel comfortable but not so large as to be awkward.  The interior appointments are quite usable and convenient.  The stereo system is terrific with all the power my 18 year-old needs.  (Plenty of bass)  The climate controls are, perhaps, a bit too clever with the infra-red sensors but seem to work well.  Some early 99's had sensor head problems but nothing too distracting.

The ride quality is great compared to the competition.  The suspension is tight yet comfortable.  The V-8 and new automatic transmission are the greatest combination I have seen to date.  Although some trans shift quality issues have come up, they were cured with a computer re-program.  The engine has more power than most will ever need and make the Jeep a joy to drive.  There are some annoying brake issues requiring rotor re-work and there has been some axle noise.  Even though this is a $40K vehicle, it still is the most capable off-road vehicle available with the Quadra-Drive system.  The dealer was able to nearly eliminate all axle noise and I am told additional engineering fixes are on the way.

All in all, this is an investment that I will enjoy for a long time.  I highly recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited to any and all. <br><br>
