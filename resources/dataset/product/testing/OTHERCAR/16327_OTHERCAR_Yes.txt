            The HP C200 is a good deal for its price range.  For those who want snapshot or family album type pictures this camera should serve adequately.  However, if you grew up on an SLR and go in for those long shots or sports (fast shots) you would be much better off looking for a more expensive machine.
While the C200 is stated to have a two power electronic zoom, I found the zoom to be difficult to use and very hard to keep steady.  I suggest that you might be better off just moving much closer to your subject.
The camera also has both auto and manual flash both with and with out red eye.  There is also a no flash setting.  The default setting is automatic flash without red eye.  If you change the setting - something best done with long fingernails - and then turn the camera off, it will reset to the default flash (this I found to be a big inconvenience).
Do not expect to be able to blow up your pictures much beyond 150%.  They become very course when you do so.  Also you may find that greens don't seem quite as green as they should.  I have long used Fugi film in my SLR for landscapes as I feel it gives a more realistic picture than Kodak.  As such, I am somewhat disappointed in the C200.
Finally, while the HP software which comes with the camera makes downloading, viewing and minor editing of the pictures very easy, if you want to do serious editing, plan on purchasing either Corel Photo-Paint or Adobe Photoshop.<br><br>
