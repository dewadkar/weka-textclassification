            The 2001 Honda Odyssey comes in two trims, LX and EX. My family bought our LX in January, 2001 and have been loving it ever since.

<b>Comparison between LX and EX trims</b>
The base LX model (MSRP $24,340):
dual sliding doors, 
height-adjustable driver seat, 
traction control, ABS, cruise control, 
power windows, power locks, power mirrors, theft-deterrent system, front and rear air conditioning.

The EX model (MSRP $26,840) adds: 
dual power sliding doors, 
eight-way power driver seat,
roof rack, keyless remote entry, alloy wheels, CD player, steering-wheel-mounted radio controls. 

Both the LX and EX trims share the same drivetrain, ie the same engine and same performance on the road.

<b>Power</b>
The Odyssey is powered by a 3.5L SOHC V6 that generates 210 hp @ 5200 rpm and is assisted by Honda's variable valve-timing VTEC technology. The front-wheel drive is tied to a 4-speed automatic transmission. EPA-rated fuel-consumption rate is 18/25 mpg for city/highway driving. While its 0-60mph of around 9 to 10 seconds is not exactly sports car territory, this minivan does accelerates like a sedan, with a curb weight of 4248 lbs and 229 ftlb of torque @ 4300 rpm. Optimal acceleration, however, requires a fairly wide throttle in first gear.

<b>Handling</b>
The four-wheel independent suspension on the vehicle is a pioneer among minivans. This translates to a smooth handling unlike its competitors. Around tight bends, other vans may behave like they are about the flip over, but not in this Honda. Cornering in the Odyssey is surprisingly comfortable and controlled, with a reasonably small body roll. At night, when the traffic is sparse, driving the Odyssey around curves makes me forget I was ever in a van and not a sedan. Moreover, should hard braking occur, Honda's Eletronic Brake Distribution system will apply varying braking pressures to each wheels in accord with the momentum of the car. This is a very well-handling minivan.

<b>Comfort and Conveniences</b>
Cup holders are everywhere! The mini-table between the front seats, with four cup holders attached, is very useful for putting whatever little things you need to have in your reach (a good place for drive-through food). Every single seat in the Odyssey gets its own three-point seatbelt and headrest, which is unheard of in such vehicles in the past. The factory only offers cloth seats, but our dealer could install leather ones for a couple thousand dollars extra; the stock seats were just fine and comfortable for me. And speaking of seats, who can forget the Odyssey's "magic" third-row seat? With one easy push or pull, the seat folds into or out of view. Brilliant, effortless, and no more tiring yourself out trying to move the row of seat out of the van. As for the second-row of seats, they are positioned on a rail, so you can either put them together as a benchseat or apart as individual seats. The LX trim does not, by the way, come with a CD player, but the dealer agreed to install one for us as part of the deal. We did not get the DVD navigation system (I do not think it is available for the LX), but the option is there for the EX. Also available on the EX are the power sliding doors, but we chose to stick with the LX and saved more than two thousand dollars.

<b>The Absolutely Practical Odyssey</b>
I can never over-emphasize on how practical this minivan is. Up to 146 cu.ft. of cargo space is available. I usually take one of the second-row seats out and leave the third-row down in the floor. With some sheets and blankets, that means my trusty Odyssey instantly transforms from a passenger vehicle to a mobile bedroom. I say this literally -- I have comfortably slept in this van many nights. If acting as a living quarter is not a cost-efficiency for an automobile (or anything other material object), I do not know what is.

<b>Bottom line</b>
the Honda Odyssey is a van you can almost live and sleep in. Although priced higher than some competitors, the Odyssey may arguably be the most reliable, practical and all-around automobile money can buy.
