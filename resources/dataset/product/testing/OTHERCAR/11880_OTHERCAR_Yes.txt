            I should start out by telling you that the Agfa 780 is no longer be made, it was replaced by the 780C.  That said, from my research there appears to be no difference between the 780 and 780C, so if you find the 780 on closeout somewhere - go for it.

As far as the 780C goes, what a gem of a camera.  Its suppose to come with a 2 meg memory card but mine came with a 4 meg (who am I to complain).  It has four modes of resolution although I'll never use the low level or resolution (so I don't know why its there).  I typically use the highest level which is 1024 X 768.  My 4 meg card will hold 22 of these pictures which is great.  I also purchased a 32 meg card which allows me 140 high resolution pictures.  

This camera has all the important bases covered.  Its able to take ANY size SanDisk SmartMedia card which are readily available.  Its very rugged so even your kids can use it and not ruin it.  It has a LCD display for both aiming and viewing your pictures as well as the &quot;regular&quot; veiwfinder.  It only takes about 2 seconds between shots if you wish to do rapid shots.  It has a builtin flash with red-eye control.  The controls are very intuitive, easy to understand and easy to use.

The bad news - well, a builtin zoom would have been nice (but for this price I'm getting greedy).  Like most digital cameras it eats its AA batteries like it starving to death (just get the rechargable ones).  One REAL annoying &quot;feature&quot; is regarding its typical viewfinder.  When the camera is operational and ready to shoot there is a green light in the viewfinder that tells you its ready - but it messes with what you are seeing, its REAL annoying.  You can overcome it, you can get by just using the LCD display instead (although that further shortens your AA battery life).  I'm surprised that this one nasty feature made it to market.  The rest of the camera is truly well designed.

I bought mine at an &quot;on-line&quot; auction and got it for $159.00 which included shipping (it was brand new).  Overall a super camera at a super price.<br><br>
