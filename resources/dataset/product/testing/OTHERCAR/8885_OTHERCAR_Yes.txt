            Well, I have to start of by saying that I don't own this car! My best friend owns one. I decided to write about it because I'm interested in it. I really liked this car because it was small and it don't take up much room. You can have about five people in it. The only thing I don't like about it is the back. The back is to high up. 

I have drove her car a few times and I love it. It's great on the road and it can fly. If you need to get somewhere this car will get you there really fast. I loved driving it on the highway. It handles very well and its comfortable. When you drive this car it's like your floating through air. I love it!

If you like to get where your going and like speed then this is the car for you. I would recommend this car to anyone. Its very nice and comfortable. If you don't like fast or low to the ground cars then I wouldn't suggest this car to you. <br><br>
