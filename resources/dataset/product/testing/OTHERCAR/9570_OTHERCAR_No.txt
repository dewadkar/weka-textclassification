             Can you believe it! The hood scoop is actually functional.
This Seventh generation Celica is by far my favorite out of my 4 Celica's
Toyota again has managed to keep the old Celica look and feel but is FAR improved. You have 2 transmission options also, no not a 5speed and automatic.
The   automatic/standard  Changes at the push of a button literally
or the 6 speed, usually only found in corvettes and other expensive sports cars no one can afford! This one is even lighter than the older Celica models, you would not believe the torque now. This car just cruises at 90mph
with a much smoother ride.Also i can say enough about the stereo system,now comes with 8 speakers!!!.These speakers practically bump by themselves, theres even a tweeter on the door handle!
   I recommend this car to any Celica fan or anyone looking for something fun to drive, it certainly is
         in fact if it was not snowing i would be out in mine right now!
