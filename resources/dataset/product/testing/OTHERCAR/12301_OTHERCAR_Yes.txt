            I have owned many great sports cars, but this has been by far the most luxurious of the bunch including an Acura Integra GS-R. The new Mitsubishi Eclipse is one hot ride. I bought the GT version about 6 months ago and haven't looked back since. The 205hp V6 is a lot of muscle for such a small car and combined with a 5 speed manual transmission this thing screams down the road. Already installed is a sport muffler that gives the GT a wonderful growl that leaves other Japanese cars sounding like toys. I opted for the silver with black leather interior, they complement each other well and the seats are quite comfortable. The overall room in the car is not much, but it is not expected, though it does seem quite a bit larger that the previous Eclipse.

I have had some minor maintenance issues:
First the a switch controlling the cruise control was not functioning. Then there was a factory safety recall on one of the steering bolts not being properly tightened. The dealership was very easy to deal with regarding getting both of these issues repaired in a timely manner. I have had no other problems with the car and have been extremely happy with the automobile.

Sticker Price was $23,702. A much better deal was eventualy negotiated<br><br>
