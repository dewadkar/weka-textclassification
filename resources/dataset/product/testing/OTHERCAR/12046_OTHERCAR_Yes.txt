            Got mine just over a year ago.  Paid full sticker $32,440 and it's worth every penny.  For those who say you can't buy one for this price check out www.s2000online.com for a list of dealers all over the country who aren't gouging & adding a "dealer markup" for this car.  I've owned sports cars before and when I heard of the S2000 I pretty much ignored it, bought into the "no torque, poor acceleration" BS pushed out by many - including magazines.  What a mistake.  I was fortunate enough to get a test drive in a used one the dealer happened to have before I bought my new one.  WOW!  That was it, I was sold.  I had just put a couple of thousand into my Nissan 300ZX with the intention of keeping it but this test drive immediately changed my mind.  It felt like I was driving a sports car for the very first time, nothing was ever as crisp and precise - acceleration, and there is plenty, wowed me based on what I expected.  Make no mistake, this is NOT a dragster, but once you get it over 6K RPMs it's a quick little beast!  It throws me back in my seat like the Z never did and is a dream to drive.  

The real beauty of the car as I see it is it's use as a daily driver.  All that you've read about having to beat the hell out of it to get it's best performance is bunk.  The only reason you'd need to beat it up is if you want to drag race it, and if that's what you want go buy a Supra Turbo, tweak that to 400+HP at the rear wheels and dream your wet dreams.  The S2000 as a daily driver is awesome.  Keep it under 6K RPMs (where VTEC kicks in) and you get great mileage, very mild mannered and manueverable through traffic.  A joy to drive and not some "screaming loud banshee".  However, when you want to open it up and have some fun, just get it to that magic VTEC range and go balls out!  Need to pass someone on the freeway?  Drop into 4th gear and you'll go from 65 to 100 in notime.

This is without question the best bang for the buck car available in the US, even the planet, today.  Do whatever it takes to get behind the wheel and see for yourself.
