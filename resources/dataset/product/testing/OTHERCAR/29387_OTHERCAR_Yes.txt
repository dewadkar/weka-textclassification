The Avalon is an amazing car.  Many people are unaware that Toyota makes Lexus.  Many more people are unfortunately unaware of the Avalon.

The Avalon has excellent pickup, a very nice 7-speaker sound system (comparable with the Acura Bosse  systems), good handling, and the solid Toyota name.

The accessories and upgrades are well worth it.  The Bucket seats truly lend luxury to the car.  Go for  the moon/sun roof.  The Seat warmers on the front seats aren't worth it.  The warmers heat up a nice section of the seat-- but the rest of the seat  is cold! Not a nice feeling.

The Plantinum Edition is a gorgeous color (although other colors or not so good).  I also liked the Avalon because there are so many BMW and Mercede bandwagons out there and the Avalon is still an undiscovered treasure (and a big one at that, bigger than the Acura).

A very good family car in the $30,000+ range
