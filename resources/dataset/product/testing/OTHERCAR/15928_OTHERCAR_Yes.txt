            Dear Reader:


  On Nov, 03 I had a car accident on 820 south. I got a rental car from Avis, it was a 4 door silver Cavalier. I was a little bit upset, I wanted a better car. I was surprise when I got inside the car. It didn't look as bad as I expected. The engine started amazingly fast, for a car with 17,000 on it. It is a 2.2liter ecotect engine, from the GM global division. This means that this engine is use from Cavaliers all the way to saabs and other GM brands. The car is fast, or at least it feels like it. The 195/65 R14 tires lack a lot grip. If you just step on it the wheels are going to spin a lot. Passing power is deliver fast and somewhat abruptly. I did notice the engine is noisy, and it gets very good fuel economy. The suspension- it surprise me a lot. The front uses McPherson struts, they are very compliant and absorb many irregularities. The rear uses a solid beam suspension. This is not the best setup and one that is very surprising to find. Specially since this is a front wheel drive car. It tends to transmit a lot of the impacts, and when you come to a stop the car feels like the rear wheels just want to keep going.

       The brakes are good, and in my rental they didn't have ABS (Anti-Lock Braking System). I strongly recommend that you get ABS no matter what. The tires don't have a lot of grip and ABS comes very handy when the road conditions are slippery. I also suggest the power door locks and windows, some people see this as a luxury but really is just too practical. Something that I like is the DRL or Daytime Running Lights, this are a safety feature to make your car more visible to oncoming traffic. Also I found out my insurance gives discount for this passive safety systems. (I use State Farms). 

       The controls in the interior are easy to find, but after you find them it could get harder to operate them. The A/C controls are just a operational nightmare. They are layout in a simple very typical pattern, but the place were they are position is not only to low on the dash. They are right in front of the cupholders. I like to drink my coke in the morning on the way to the University, imagine trying to operate the heater or defrost in the winter mornings. Of course the cupholders are now in front of the Shifter which now if you are park makes it a little bit difficult to get the drinks. The instrument cluster is very good, well layout and very well illuminated. It has everything you need and is easy to read. The car has cruise control which is a god send, it is the typical cruise control from GM since back from the 80's. 

    The rear seats are just horrible, and also they can give you a little bit of back pain. The material use for the seats is a little bit cheap looking but is not bad. The car has a lot of front and side visibility and only the rear window visibility might be a little bit problematic. The trunk is spacious and very well layout, it will hold a lot of groceries. So all in all, is a good car for anyone on a budget or for a first time buyer. I suggest that you choose the ABS no matter what. I hope this is helpful for you and have a good day.
