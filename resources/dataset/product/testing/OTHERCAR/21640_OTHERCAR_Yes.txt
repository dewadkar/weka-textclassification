            The following is a review of the 2001 Acura CL.

Just introduced to the US market (and only the US market, if I'm not mistaken) a month ago (March 2000) the brand-new 2001 Acura CL is obvious to become a sales leader in its segment.

The car has new sheet metal and both new and borrowed options.  It is offered in regular form, and a sportier Type S form.  Right off the bat, let me just say, I will be comparing this car to TODAY'S cars, TODAY'S competition.  If you are a previous CL owner, I am sure that you will be wholeheartedly impressed with this car.  More later...

Splitting up the review into categories:

Exterior:  As usual, first-rate fit and finish.  I really sometimes wonder if Honda/Acura have equally excellent f&amp;f as Toyota/Lexus.  I think that these days, it's arguably so.  The design certainly impressed me, as before I saw one in the flesh I expected it be unappealing, especially the back end light treatment.  That wasn't so.  :)  It certainly looks a little sharper than the TL, front and back.  However, as of right now, I would say that I like the CL's front better than the TL's, but vice-versa concerning the rear-end (though still a lot better-looking than in the pics!)

Interior:  Same goes here about the fit and finish.  Flawless.  Space-wise, very similar to TL.  Headroom's OK, not great (same with TL).  Back seat room is impressive (as it is in the new BMW 3-series coupes) but not great for 6 footers and above, as usual.  But they even get cupholders and whatnot!  The front seats are GORGEOUS.  I was very impressed with the design, and the bolstering.  I'm pretty sure the seats' shape is the same in the regular CL as opposed to the Type S that I evaluated/drove.  There is also a neat feature previously exclusive to much more expensive coupes that electrically moves the entire front seats forward when the seatback is tilted, to allow quick and easy rear access.  There is now an IN-DASH 6-CD changer.  That, with a navi system (excellent, better than German systems thus far) AND a cassette player, all at once.  How cool is that?  Kudos to Acura for designing it so excellently.  The competition usually forces you to choose (want in-dash cd?  Ok, but sorry, no navi?  And vice-versa).  The Bose system is 6-speakers now (I guess there are 2 subwoofers in the back now, as the TL had one, thus 5 total, not sure if the wattage is the same, but it did sound better than the TL's system, at least the low-frequencies).  2-position memory for the seat/mirror settings is now standard on the CL as well, a much-desired feature in the TL.  Pretty much everything else is the same as in the TL, 'cept for a thicker steering wheel (again maybe a Type S thing).  So I guess that's a whole lot of updates eh? Trunk space is HUGE by the way, for a coupe.

Engineering:  The CL's inner-workings are close to the TL's, almost completely.  The suspension design is the same excellent double-wishbone around all fours, but the CL's obviously more sport-oriented, especially the Type S (more on that later) so the cars get larger anti-roll bars, for example.  But I believe the brakes are identical.  So really in the safety/engineering dept., you're looking at a TL with a lower stance, 2 less doors, and some stiffer roll bars.  However, VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist) is now std. on the CL as well (on the Type S, not the regular).  I don't know if Acura will have VSA on the TL next year, but then again, look at BMW and Benz...they've added it to all their cars.  We'll see.

Drive:  Well before I dive into this, let me list the differences between the regular CL and the Type S:

Type S:

260HP
Perforated leather interior
215/50R17 wheels/tires
Larger anti-roll bars
'Type S' shifter (very cool)
Titanium-colored dash gauges (nice)

I think that's it.  The regular CL has 225HP, the exact same engine as the TL.  Both have the identical 5-spd sportshift tranny from the TL.

The Type S started up with a nice sound.  Idle was extremely quiet, as usual.  Very refined feel.  Getting on my way, the car seemed more planted than the TL, for sure.  Must be those large tires (albeit with the same Michelin MXV4s (read, CRAPPY for performance, but great for longevity)).  And the suspension of course is obviously been given less play.  Besides this, the car felt just like a TL.  Very stable, refined.

Getting on the gas, I didn't expect violent torque.  These cars, remember are quite heavy, about 3600 lbs, so you need more than 35 horses to feel a big difference in acceleration.  Nonetheless, the throttle depression awakened a small beast and let out a great-sounding engine scream 4000RPM and above.  I love VTEC.  I have to note that I didn't try out the car on the highway, so never go to above 70mph, but I bet at triple digit speeds the acceleration is probably very impressive.  See, even at low speeds, you look at the speedo and the needle rises FAST, you just don't feel a violent pull.  That I guess is the beauty of the VTEC.  If you look in the CL brochure, there is a power/torque graph, and as you can see from the torque curve for the Type S, it is completely flat almost the entire rev range!  The extra horsepower really is just given you as much pulling power as you are making at mid engine speeds up above 5000RPM, all the way to redline, at least close to.  So again, you won't FEEL a violent pull, but the car is picking up speed fast.

Handling?  Certainly better than the TLs.  The turns I took at speed certainly showed this.  Much more planted done.  The steering feel is pretty good, just nothing like an Audi's or BMW in the turns.  

Brakes were more than sufficient, but again, the competition (albeit as you all know, a pricier less-gizmo-laden one) is better at this.  

The CL, even in Type S form, is certainly trying to appear sporty, and succeeds in some ways, but you don't have to be a Schumacher to realize right from the start that its forte is comfy cruising.  Sorry, that's the fact of it all.  Being a front-wheel driven car, with no manual tranny available, you just can expect the engineers to have designed the suspension and chassis to handle like the best of them.

Speaking of, I experienced torque-steer in the Type S.  Not surprised.  There's a lot of torque going to the front wheels, and I did a WOT launch from a stop.  It wasn't scary at all, and it was very little, but obvious.  I said to myself &quot;hmm, I wonder how much power a FWD car can really deal with, regardless of suspension design, without torque-steering from a standing-still WOT launch...&quot;.  

All in all, a great car, and a great value, to be sure.  Just don't expect the finesse and handling superiority over other sporty coupes on the road in the turns especially.  It's that simple.  Then again, just reading this review, I didn't expect you to expect me to say anything along the lines of &quot;the new CL is VASTLY DIFFERENT from the new TL&quot;.  Thus, I rest my case.  Don't misunderstand...if you aren't one to care about appreciating world-class chassis control and handling, and DO NOT want a stick no matter what, this is a fabulous buy, and YOU WILL HAVE TONS of fun in the twisties, especially with a Type S with upgraded tires.  

Just sign over that check with the realization that you cannot and should not ever be disappointed with your car's handling compared to the German coupe/sedan you just drove (or will drive later), as the designers didn't MEAN it to be that, a greatly-capable sports machine.  The Japanese either don't know how or don't care to know how to integrate fabulous luxury with sportiness, regardless of price, as the Germans do.  

You think I'm saying that just because of the FWD layout or auto-only tranny?  Well you should know that even the excellent Lexus GS-series (RWD, very-performance oriented, supposedly) don't fall in my list for &quot;top handling/sporty sedans/coupes&quot;.   

Sorry if I touched any nerves, but I don't think I can get more honest and complete than this.  It takes a lot of time and experience (and CARING) to really be able to tell the differences between handling abilities of one car to the next.  The CL is not a sports coupe.  To be called that you really need to impress exceedingly in at least a couple of &quot;handling categories&quot;.  The CL is more like, in the middle, just where the designers intended it to be.

If you asked me to rate the CL from 1-5 on sportiness, I'd probably give even the Type S a 3.  That means, certainly capable, nothing is BAD, just in the middle, nothing is impressive (compared to today's competition).  But ask me overall, I would say 4/5 for those who really care about a well-rounded package, and a 5/5 of those who want value (reliability of Acuras leaves nothing to be desired, as you already know, too).  Like I was saying, if you are trading in your old CL for this, you will be extremely satisfied, thus a solid 5/5.  Acura has done a fabulous job with this car, and they designed it EXACTLY as they wanted (the marketing hyping up the sportiness though, uhm, for me, is somewhat inaccurate). ;)

But for the reviewer (me) I honestly have to go for a 4/5.  If it wasn't for a incredible value and content, I would PROBABLY think of a 3.  Even though I highly regard luxury and a comfy highway ride, especially when you realize how important that is for this country's drivers.

So I just gave you a 3, a 4, and a 5!  Take your pick, you're an individual, with rights of Epinion!!!!!!  :)

But me, a 4. <br><br>
