            When I originally thought of purchasing my first SUV a couple of years ago, it was for a few reasons. I needed a vehicle that was great in bad weather (northwest NJ), was dependable, with good mileage, smaller sized so I could also drive and park it in city situations, driving comfort, interior room including enough space to carry my stuff around and a reasonable price tag. When it came time for me to buy (just recently), I had been doing research for a while and had narrowed it down to 3 vehicles: the Rav4, the Subaru Forester and the new Nissan Xterra. Others such as Suzuki's and Geo's seemed too small and cheaply made, and with all the varied driving I do for work (country, city) anything larger like a 4Runner, etc. just didn't seem feasible.

I eventually chose the Rav4 due to Toyota's long history of reliability, it's apparent driving enjoyment and frankly, its looks! I also liked the look of the Xterra, but, I had seen nothing but negative press on it's uncomfortable truck-like ride, and the Subaru was actually a little boxy and plain for me. When the new 2001 styling came out (much of the design borrowed from the Lexus line), that sealed the deal. And I couldn't be happier with the purchase.

First off, as they say, the Rav4 handling IS very similar to a car (as it is car-based, not truck-based like the Xterra and others). It's more than adequate horsepower (bumped up for 2001), allows it to zip around town or drive the passing lane on the Turnpike without any hassles. Cornering is better than I expected (no &quot;tipping over&quot; type sensations) and the turning circle is also tighter than I thought, great for quick K-turns in city driving.

Visibility is great and the large front halogens flood the road with light. The slight &quot;bubble&quot; type styling gives the back seat a lot of headroom, and larger adults seem to fit with ease. Ergonomics are good, with the cd/radio set up high in the center console to keep your eyes on the road, and little pockets/cupholders/cubbies in every corner. And I always liked the rear hatch, which opens from the side like a regular car door.

Although it is extra, the &quot;L&quot; package is a must, since the basic model unfortunately lacks many amenities such as rear wipers, fog lights, cd player, etc.

So overall, I couldn't be more pleased. My Rav4 has been over hill and dale, on curving country roads and Newark side streets; it zips up and down my steep, winding driveway and fits into my crowded garage without bumping into things. And as Car and Driver says about the new 2001 &quot;we can't find an SUV that's more fun to drive.&quot;

So if you want utility AND fun, the 2001 Rav4 is hard to beat.<br><br>
