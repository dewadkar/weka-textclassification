            I bought my first Mitsubishi in 1987.  I drove this truck totally trouble free for more than 8 years.  In 1995 I purchased a Mirage S. the vehicle is also a 1995.  I have put 60,000 miles on the car and have had no problems other than recently having to put brakes on the car. (54,000 mi)
I bought this vehicle because I trust Mitsubishi to build a good product as demonstrated to me by the truck I had previously. It is a small vehicle that fits easily into tight parking spots and gets excellent gas mileage, about 35 mpg. The car came with a stereo that could be considered fair at best but excellent speakers.  Dual air bags are a nice safety feature. However the passenger side airbag cannot be disabled.  I would recommend this vehicle if you do alot of driving say for work. It works well for a single person. I have had one accident in this car I hit a vehicle at about 35 mph and sustained minimal damage and was unhurt. At a purchase price that's affordable, insurance is as well.  Its not in a high risk to be stolen category.  Back seat is a bit small, trunk is good size.  Drives well in snow.<br><br>
