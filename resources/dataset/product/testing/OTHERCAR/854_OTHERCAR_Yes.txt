                 Ever since I started reviewing Digital Cameras I've been looking forward to looking at the Olympus C-3000 and I have to say that this camera didn't disappoint! This is a fantastic piece of equipment.  Capable of satisfying anyone from the inexperienced novice to the experienced point and shoot photographer.  It will take you as far as you need to go with your photography needs.  First, let me list the specifications of the Olympus C-3000.

* This digital camera has an impressive 3.34 Megapixel or 2048 x 1536 resolution
* The lens is an all glass 3x optical zoom supported with a 2.5 digital zoom.
* The camera has USB connections for easy downloads
* Quicktime has been vastly improved and now allows you to record audio to accompany video recordings of 60 or 15 seconds.  There is even a feature that allows a 4 second sound bite
* The other major upgrade for the C-3000 is around resolution settings. Now pictures can be set in 15 different formats including 5 Tiff features
* There are 6 independent flash modes with red eye reduction
* The camera comes equipped with an 8 mb card and cost around $800 dollars.

<b> Now let's examine these features a little more closely </b>

1. <b> 3.34 megapixel resoultion </b>:  With this kind of clarity, this truly is a multi-purpose camera.  Using any photo-quality printer you can produce beautiful photos.  8x11 photos come out sharp and detailed.  And using the Adobe photoshop you can customize your photos to meet your needs.  Build a scrapbook, attach a attractive border, the choices and possibilities are virtually endless.

2.  <b> The lens </b>  The lens on the Olympus C-3000 really allows you to take control.  If your inexperienced at photography, trust the autofocus to produce high-quality shots.  On the other hand, if your the type of photographer who likes to take control of your scene then you will marvel at the optical zoom.  It really allows you to take quality shots with utmost precision.

3. <b> The quicktime features </b>  Here is where the Olympus C-3000 really made some dramatic improvements over the 2020.  The Olympus 2020 had the ability to take quicktime movies, but it was limited to video only and really came off feeling like you were watching a silent film.  Here, you really have the ability to personalize your video.  Sound can now be recorded for up to 60 seconds and there is even the ability to add a 4 second introduction to your video.  The resolution is dramatically lower on the video 160x220 or 320x240 on high resolution but what your really getting here is a video recorder built into your camera.  A nice improvement.

4.  <b> Programmable resolution settings </b>   Here is the other dramatic improvement Olympus made for its 3000 series camera.  New settings allow you to set your cameras resolution to 15 different settings including 5 uncompressed TIFF settings.  If you have large memory or your trying to conserve space this camera allows you to customize settings to maximize resolution while minimizing storage space.  The instruction guide points out the conversion rates and will make you a smarter photographer.

<b> And a final word of caution </b>

Don't even think of purchasing this dream machine without dishing out for the upgrades.  The 8 mb card that this camera comes with is entirely inadequate.  For example, at the highest resolution you can store 3 pictures in JPEG mode and no pictures in TIFF mode.  I suggest that you invest in a 32 mb card or your just limiting the abilities of this camera. Also, unless you want to be watching paint dry while these pictures download onto your computer then you better buy a Sandisk reader.  It is a minimal investment and will save yourself a lot of time and frustration.  True, the USB connection is better than the older serial connections but it is still inadequate.

Overall, I have to give this camera high props.  At $799 dollars it's fairly pricey, but it is highly versatile.  Unless your planning to use your digital camera exclusively for putting photos on the internet than I would consider the Olympus C-3000.  I think you'll find that it might just be too cool to put down!<br><br>
