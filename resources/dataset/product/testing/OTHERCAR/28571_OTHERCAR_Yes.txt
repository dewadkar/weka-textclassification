            There is a line in &quot;Life's Little Instruction Book&quot; that advises something to the effect of &quot;at at least one point in your life you must own a convertible.&quot;  I have modified that somewhat to &quot;at all points in your life you must own at least one convertible.&quot;
So, why the Jeep Wrangler?  The easy answer is that it is simply more fun.  The other reasons, in which you may be more or less interested in, were that I wanted a little more space than other convertibles offered, and I didn't want such a &quot;girlie&quot; car.  The Wrangler also keeps up with my very active lifestyle.  The 2000 model has a redesigned dashboard, with an easy to use and read display.
The downside- the top takes a long time to take on and off.  However, once it is off, it is worth both trips.  The ride is not the smoothest, but if you get a car like a Jeep, you shouldn't be expected such a smooth ride anyway.
In terms of option- 1.) hardtop- I don't have it, and I live in a city.  I haven't felt at a loss at all.  In fact, if anything, I'm glad I don't have to deal with carting it around.  2.)  Glass windows (front)- a definite must.  I didn't realize that they were an option and got them almost accidentally.  Can you imagine rolling up to a toll both in pouring rain, trying to deal with finding change, the toll ticket, maps, or any combination of the above and having to first deal with unzippering a window?  Exactly. 3.) Special hubcaps- they just make the car all that much cooler.  You don't NEED them, but I know that you WANT them<br><br>
