            I had to do it, we had our third child just over one year ago and I had to get a "MINIVAN."  I was NOT the kind of mother that would EVER buy something like that, but after the SUV's I have been driving around in for so many years, the thoughts of buying one of those SUPER SIZED SUV's made my spine shutter. Already, I have a bad back and I needed somthing easy to get in and out of. So I decided it was finally TIME to do it, time to buy the "MINIVAN".

I was all set to get the ACURA MDX, since it has a third row of seats and is an AWD SUV, but the thought of always having a child trying to climb over the top of the seats, or me having to flip the back down, was just horrible. I am anal about keeping a clean car, and I knew my children would fight up a storm in that car, who was going to sit where and ect,.

So, we had finally decided to just get the Chysler Town and Country Limited. It is a wonderful car, with ultra suede leather tops on all seats, and the seats are 100% leather, making it very easy for mom to wipe off any spots. The two front seats have heating, and they are both seprately controlled, making it very easy to get comfortable. Both front seats are power controlled, the driver seat has a memory button for up to 2 people, this way you and your spouse do not have big fights about who moved the seat this way or that way =) The two captains chairs behind, are great also, they flip FWD if you need them to be for extra storage, if you have a baby the instalation of a tether is the easiest thing in the entire WORKD! So my baby has a captains seat all to himself, and usually my daughter get's the one next to him, and the back row of seats (total seating is 7 passengers) are just like captains chairs if you put the wide armrest down in the middle (in the middle you can sit another person very comfortably).

The trunk pops open with the touch of another button on the key chain & inside (oh also inside you can use the buttons above your mirror to open doors), and not to worry it has a sensor on it so if it touches anything it will pop right back down or up. It has a garage door control built right into it, it covers THREE garage doors! It is easy to adjust the heating and cooling, as it is all just the touch of a button. My car also has a sensor (optional) when you back up, to let you know whether or not there are any cars, people, dog's, or garbage can's behind you. 

This car,let me tell you, it has SPUNK, and my motor head husband actually loves to drive it as it has so much BUZZ when you step on the pedal to the metal =) He loves the 6 CD disk that came with the car and it is right up front so easy to install your disks and take them out, listening to great music. The ride is so smooth, much smoother than any SUV I test drove. No bumps, no bounces, nothing but nice smooth ride.

My car, and I think all of the Chryslers come this way, has TRACTION CONTROL, now this will be a first for me as I always had a JEEP. So far, no problems, even driving in the rain storms we have had.

Just a few more things to let you know, the trunk is large, not tiny as the ACURA SUV, also it comes with grocery bag holders. You can fit a lot into this minivan and you can all sit in it comfortably. The only other thing is, it does not come with a TV/VCR, but we will order one from MOPAR.
I would have gotten the AWD Chrslyer, but they were all sold out! I had two options in color as NOBODY else around where I live had any LIMITED's, so it was either a NAVY BLUE or a WINE color. I opted for the NAVY blue as it had a taupe interior and that I liked. I would have rathered the WHITE or SILVER AWD, but I had to have the car when I needed it.

Really, our entire family loves this new "minivan."

If you have any questions email me and I would be more than happy to answer. My husband can answer the motor/engine part of it as I am not good at that. All I know is the car MOVES, and it moves FAST.

If you want comfort, if you want good pickup, I would opt for this car. We looked at all the others, and with a back problem I just knew this would be the one for me. The FORD always hurt my back, no matter which one I drove. 
I have driven each model of "The Town & Country" and this one was the one for ME!
