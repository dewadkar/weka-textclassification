            Since I'm in the market for a regular cab truck, I've found that in recent years they just aren't very popular except as pure work vehicles, stripped down and ready for service.  It's very hard to find one that's equipped for personal use on the lots now.   That's a shame, because for my type of use, the Dodge Ram regular cab has a huge advantage over its competition in terms of useable cab space behind the seat. 

The new Ram is definitely improved in almost every objective area.  They did an especially good job of correcting the truck's main flaws, steering, braking, transmission, and noise/harshness/vibration.

I've driven both regular cab and quad cab Rams, so here's my review of what I've seen so far:

EXTERIOR: 

 The new RAM is basically the same exterior design, just with the lines smoothed out and the grill enlarged..a lot.   At first this put me off, but like I've read in some other reviews, it really does start to grow on you.  I especially prefer the body colored "sport" appearance package, as this tends to make the grill less prominent and I've noticed that chrome grills tend to look like horseshoes hung from the front of the truck when I see them on the road.  The new ram looks bigger, the wheel wells are huge, and it has had the cab space on both models stretched 3" for more room inside, at the expense of 3" of bed space, which I find negligible.  You can tell this truck was designed as a quad cab from the start.  It is a very nicely integrated cab space.  The proportions look great. The windshield is more raked now, so it cuts noise and looks better too.

Maybe it's the Daimler Benz influence, but the paint on these trucks looks to be a huge improvement over old.  Very glossy and up market looking.  Let's hope it stays that way.  My previous Ram's paint wasn't that outstanding, with application  flaws  and a duller quality.  

The look is very aerodynamic.   This does a lot to cut down on wind noise vs. the old Ram.  I like the wheel choices, with 17" stock and huge 20" wheels and tires available as an option.   There are three models, ST and SLT, with SLT plus available for those who miss their luxury cars.  ST is mostly for work use, and the small premium for SLT over ST makes it worth considering.  Especially come resale time.  Buy ST's only if you're buying a dozen for your business.  Otherwise, get the SLT package.   There are probably a few minor trim differences outside on the models, but the most notable to me was the grill.  The SLT plus models can be spotted by their unique grill design. they have a body color surround, with the cross bars in chrome.  Assembly quality from my brief exposure also looked improved.  No obvious trim or panel problems. 

Overall, I really like the new Ram's styling, but I would be sure to order the larger 17" tire size or the 20", since the huge size of the body will overwhelm skinny tires, leaving it looking odd.  Proportionally, the 20" aren't really that big.   They fit the truck well.  And thankfully, Goodyear makes a replacement tire that is only $150 or so, not the $225 plus you find on some smaller 18" wheels on some trucks (Ford Lightning)

INTERIOR:

 This is where the RAM really shows its stuff.  I actually prefered the last model's interior, but the new Ram is nice too.  The seats are very comfortable for me, as before.  The steering wheel/seat distance is also good, unlike the F150, where I just can't get comfortable.   Unlike the Toyota Tundra, where you sit with your legs more horizontally in front of you, the Ram has you sitting high. I prefer this.  I'm not a huge fan of white dials, since they're simply trying to look "sporty", but I don't consider them a detriment either.  

The optional Infiniti stereo system is overpriced and underperforming. Save your money and you can buy a much better aftermarket system for less.  

Visability is generally good, but on Regular cab models the huge B pillar tends to create a blind spot.  The 3" bigger cab seems to be the culprit here.   Also, the A pillar is very wide, and still blocks side vision a bit in turns. It's ok once you get used to it, but you have to move your head in some situations to see around it.  

Seat materials feel good, with a texture I like.   The dash materials seem to be a step back, and in some colors it looks cheap.   But this is a truck, so I'm not expecting Lexus quality here.  The big size of the cab can make reaching some radio/climate controls a stretch for shorter drivers, but I like the layout. It's simple and effective.

In Quad cab models, they have nice features available like folding package shelves in back.  The extra cab space also makes it more comfortable for your passengers.  A lot of people pick a truck based on rear passenger comfort. But I say think twice. It's usually kids in back (who usually don't care about that) or short trips with friends.  You have to drive it and live with it.  Pick it for the rest of the truck, not a place you'll probably never even sit.  

The console is the best in the business. Fold down dividers and a flat profile for setting a clipboard make it a favorite with contractors.  It also holds the driver in place during turns.   One negative of the big cab is that I couldn't find a comfortable spot for my left elbow on the door armrest.  It's too far away!   But that's not a big deal.

But I'm more interested in the regular cab models.  The extra cab space, added to the already largest-in-class regular cab, makes this a regular cab truck that can really haul a lot of stuff in the cab.   Enough room to haul several  5 gallon buckets behind the seats enough for you?  Makes it great for getting groceries.  It also leaves enough room for tall drivers to recline the seatbacks, unlike the GM models.   This makes a regular cab Ram a great choice for couples and singles who rarely have more than 3 in the truck.  Drive them and park them on the lot. You'll be amazed how much easier it is to get into tight mall parking spaces, or much more important, back out of one.   I prefer regular cab trucks for towing, also. It's much easier to back a trailer with a short wheelbase truck.  The regular cab also seems more maneuverable on the road, though at a slight ride quality penalty.  

PEFORMANCE:

This is one area where the results are mixed on the redesign.  Off roaders will hate the new front independent suspension, but most will prefer the better handling and ride it provides.  Steering is taught and tight due to a new rack and pinion system, with none of the wandering of before.   Braking is top notch, which was a major flaw of my '97 Ram.  Rear ABS is an option, though I rarely saw it on any vehicles on lots.  Handling is improved, and though it still feels a little "big" to me, it's definitely improved.  The truck sits high, even in 2wd form, so there are limits to what they can do with handling.  I think the bigger tires would help here.   The ride was smooth and quiet, except for engine exhaust noise on heavy acceleration. Which brings me to the only major problem with the new Ram.  Powertrains.

A V-6 engine is available, but forget it for all but the tightest budgets and fleet trucks.  You will more than recoup your investment in a V8 on resale and with increased longevity.  The new 4.7L V-8 is nice, providing 240hp and 300 lb ft of torque. Comparable with the "smaller" V8 engines of the competition.  It's a more sophisticated sohc design than the old 5.2 it replaced.   It's adequate.  The problem is that many buyers want more than adequate performance when spending $25K-$35K on a truck.  They want to haul big boats and haul "rear", too, sometimes.   The old 5.9 V8 available for this just doesn't cut it.  It's a reliable engine, but an old design.  A little loud, but the main flaw is the mediocre transmission it's mated to.   The 4.7L comes with a new 4 speed transmission with two 2nd gears.  This means better use of the available power.   The old transmission was unreliable and hunts for gears more than it should.   This powertrain deficit only becomes a problem on heavier models like 4x4 quad cabs.  Trouble is, they're not selling that many 2wd regular cabs anymore, for which the 4.7L is fine.   I would advise waiting a year and getting the new 5.7? Hemi engine that will provide much more power for heavy duty users.   

SAFETY:

The new Ram hasn't been crash tested yet, and most other Chrysler products have been average to below average.  Let's hope the Ram is an exception.  Usually new models are safer, though, so hopefully it will score well.  Good news is an available side curtain airbag system, the first in the classs.  The problem is that I have never actually seen one available on lots, you'll have to order one.   Seems Dodge customers aren't too safety conscious, since they also don't have many with 4 wheel ABS on lots either.   But the truck's 4500-5500 curb weight goes a long way too towards helping in an accident.  The improved handling and braking does also.  

DEALERS, WARRANTY, RELIABILITY, RESALE:

What can I say about Dodge dealers, except they seem to have a bad rep.  Internet bulletin boards are full of complaints about not being able to get warranty work done or done properly.  Seems they like to stonewall.  Take this into account.  You may have a trouble-free experience, or you may not.  I also find many Dodge dealers have "old fashion" hustling type sales practices. This isn't unique to Dodge, but be aware that they will try to push you to buy a Ram off the lot  TODAY, rather than guide you to the vehicle options you really want.  My service department experiences at 3 dealers weren't stellar, either.  Two attempts was the average to fix a problem. 

The current 100K mile powertrain warranty is a nice plus.  They tended to have transmission problems in the past, so this helps to reassure buyers. But only if Dodge dealers stand behind the warranty and do the work.  We'll see.  The base warranty is a comprehensive 36K mile, 3 year one.  

Reliability of Chrysler products hasn't been very good over the years.   Some models are better than others, however.  My '97 Ram was in the shop 5 times in 3 years, for what that's worth, with transmission, CD player, and brake problems.   Not terrible, but not stellar, either.  This reliability perception may affect resale.  

Overall full sized truck resale is great.  They just don't drop in value like a car.   In my area, Chevrolets and Toyotas seem to do the best, followed by Ford, and then Dodge.  But the Dodge is usually priced lower to start, so that may negate this.   

The key to your ownership experience will be to find a good dealer who will fix your Ram if it breaks.   


Overall, I prefer the Ram over the competition in the regular cab configuration.  Quad cabs are more competitive.  They're all good trucks, and will be relatively inexpensive to own and operate.  A key to keeping costs low is watching the options list.   Adding $3000 in stereo, wood trim, leather, etc to a pickup will not result in $3000 more at resale time.   Other than the SLT package, 4 wheel drive, nice sized wheels/tires that improve appearance, color selection, and a few other key options in high demand, options bring close to ZERO on resale.  Used buyers looking at $12,000 pickups can't afford your leather and wood and security system and overhead console. They need the basics first.
