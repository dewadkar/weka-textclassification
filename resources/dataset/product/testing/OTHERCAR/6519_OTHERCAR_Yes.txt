            About a year ago I bought my 1996 Volvo 960 . It had 60K miles on it, and looked really sharp, with its emerald green body, cream leather interior on 4 speed a/t transmission (economy, sport and winter mode). My wife was impressed with the buy, for she always wanted a luxury vehicle. The car itself gave me a few problems at the very beginning : I had to replace a gasket, for all engine oil leaked out on the pavement, and also I had to install new A/C compressor . But, that was almost one year ago and I've had no problems ever since. Some say that if you buy a luxury car, it is very costly to maintain it. The thing is, though, that this car rarely breaks down. All you have to do it preventive maintenance (like timing belt -$245, every 70K miles, serpentine belt $42 every 60K miles, brakes $120-130 per axle).If you like a Cadillac-type ride,lot of space for you and passengers, superb road handling, plenty of horse power and torque, look no further, buy the 960. The only draw back to this car is its high fuel consumption, which although cited by manufacturer at 17 city, 26 hwy, is more like 14 city, 24 hwy.With today's gas prices that does not help.
