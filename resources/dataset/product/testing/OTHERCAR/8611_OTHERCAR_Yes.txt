            We traded in our Mercury on the Honda Odyssey, and wish I had done it much much sooner. The van has more power (15 horses) than my Grand Marquis, more room, and better gas mileage (17-25).

The van itself comes in three models:

LX - Base model (ours, but it hardly seems base.) This one has five doors, the "magic seat" that folds into a large compartment in the back, configurable 2nd row seats, AM/FM cassette with CD controls, dual air bags, dual (front and rear) air controls, 215 h.p. V-6, 16 inch wheels, A/C, traction control, cruise control, and 9 cup holders.

EX - Same, with a higher quality fabric on the seats, better radio, power sliding doors, luggage rack, fog lights.

EX Nav - Same, with a built in trip computer. 

The van has so many good things going for it, I'll start with the couple of things that aren't so good. 

Availability. Honda can't keep up. Dealers apparently have waiting lists in some locations, and the few that come in will often be marked up (ours had an additional $4,500 over MSRP on the sticker.) So if you do go looking, you may have to drive a different model than you want, or buy a different model.

Driving lights. For whatever reason, there are no daytime running lights on this thing. I thought we were kind of moving toward standard with that, but I guess not. 

Fan. The fan on the cooling system is LOUD. Settings 1-3 are not too bad, but 4 is super loud. It is almost hard to talk over.

But, as always, those are a so what. There is so much to love about this van. We drove Caravans and Siennas, Ventures and Windstars before driving this, and this is absolutely the best. The price is very very competitive, MSRP for the base is 24,500 or so. 

The size is no comparison. With the rear seat up, you can store a whole load of junk in the well the seat goes in. Groceries, several bags. I stuck two 50 pound dog food bags in the well. With the rear seat down, there is as much room as a Suburban for hauling cargo. Take out the two middle seats, and you can carry plywood.

The middle row of seats can be set to simulate a bench, with a pass-through on the right side between the seat and the wall. They can also be separated like two captains chairs with a pass through in the middle. The rear seats weigh approximately 40 pounds - less than a large bag of the afore-mentioned dog food - and are easily removed, even by my wife. 

There is a set of controls in back for the rear A/C and heater. We live in the desert, and rear air is a must. It is also a $1500 option on the other vans.

The 215 horses are ready to go. We haven't gone drag racing, as we are still breaking it in - gotta do 5000 miles first - but it has a whole lotta spunk.

The radio has controllers built in to run a CD changer. We bought an Alpine (they are compatible), and are very happy with even the base sound system. 

There is a HEPA filter in the back to clean the recycled air. That is just too cool.

Finally, the price. The dealer will tell you there are waiting lists. They will warn you to buy now or loose your chance. They will say they could sell it 10 times over tomorrow. Tell them good luck. Deal on this as you would any other car. We paid less than MSRP, and got low book on our trade in.  This came it to about $500 more than the base Sienna, and this van is so much more. Bigger, nicer, better equipped, do I really need to do the list again?

If you are looking for ANY new car, consider the Odyssey. They are far from nerdy, super functional, super convenient, well laid out, powerful, efficient, everything. Once you've had a van, you'll wonder how you survived with out it.

Today, my Consumer Reports magazine shows up. The winner in the van category is, of course, the Odyssey. Wins all categories hands down.
