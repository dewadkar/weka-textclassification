            As a recent owner of a Volkswagon Golf you can expect one heck of a car.
Not only is this an incredibly stylish car, It is also very affordable.
Volkswagon has led the way in car design for years, and just recently have I been able to put this design to the test. The Golf offers a sporty look, (a little smaller than the Jetta, and Passat), but still comes just as loaded.
It has a bit of a European feel, and definately gets all the looks you've been wanting from a car. I don't know how many times people have asked me to just look inside it.
Mine is the smaller engine the 2.0 L 4 cylinder, but offers plenty of speed. It also comes in a 1.5 L Diesel and a 1.8 L. Diesel Turbo (which is quite a bit faster) but you pay for it. Under the hood, everything is black except the items you need to change or look at...i.e. the oil dipstick, windshield wiper fluid, things like this...are colored, bright orange...The design of this car is amazing. The ride is so smooth and has a bit of a Mercedes interior. A hands free sunroof, one twist of a knob, opens it, without having to hold your hand on a button, the same with two front windows...
It comes with an amazing Monsoon sound system, which I didn't fully appreciate until I put a tape in...A c.d. always sounds pretty good.
But I was skeptical of a tape.
I put it in and wow!...It was almost just as amazing..This small eight speaker system blows any lame subwoofer out of the water.

Anyone will enjoy this car, the back seat is a bit small, but works for a recent graduate.

Check it out yourself.
