            I must say My husband and I just love our new 2000 Montero. With so many SUV's out today, there is many to choose from, between the Ford Explorers, Rodeo's,Dodge Durango, etc.But I must say I love the look and Price of the Mitsubishi Montero Sport.

Our previous car was 4 door VW Golf, so going from a compact car to a SUV, you sure notice to the difference in durable and SPACE.Personally, we will never choose a small compact car again, but yet my husband is already talking about in 3 years trading this Montero in for the new model.

The interior is comfortable and very nice looking. Between having keyless entry, cruise control( which we did'nt have on the other car), seat adjustment controls, and having a CD Player, and not a tape player is soo nice( we had a tape player in the old car)The sound system in the car is rather good for a stock system.We also got the car with the windows already tinted, which I think is what got me, due to the fact that we live in California desert, where in the summer it can reach up to 130 in the summer time. In the backseat, the  seats split and fold down  proveing to be very convenient, and the center seats has a huge drink holder which is soo handy with a 3 year old back there, this way we don't have to pass her drink to her, she can put in her drink holder.

The one thing I don't like is the fact that the car eats up the gas, and only gets 20 miles per gallon, but other than that, I have so far loved out new Montero..well there is one other downside, I wish it would seat more than 5 people, but then again we are only a family of 3, and don't need a car that seats 8 people, but I am sure by the time we need more room, Mitsubishi will come out with something that seats more than 5. 

We also leased our montero, which was a downfall too, cause your only allowed 10,000 miles per year on a 4 year lease, which does'nt work out to much when you break it down in milies per month, which works out to be 850 a month, and like that is possiable, to only put 850 a month...
