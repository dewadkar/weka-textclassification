            I was looking forward to buying an Olympus, but I saw the S30 and I thought it would be very nice to have. It seemed to have more functions and quality than the Olympus I was looking for. I tried it a few times, and I put some pictures on my computer. The detail and quality was so perfect. I tried using the E-mail feature in the camera functions and it took only a minute to e-mail a 1.3 Megapixels picture. What they say about the weak flash is not true. I took a picture of a friend of mine in the dark. The LCD was showing only a shade of the person, but the exposure of the picture was perfect. I could see everything in detail. If you want to buy your first digital camera, this should be it. 
-To Professional photographers, don't get this camera, try something more complicated like a Mavica or an S70.  <br><br>
