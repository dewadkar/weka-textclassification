            the Jeep Wrangler is one of the hotest cars out on the market today. The Wrangler can handle any kind of terrain.  the off roading capabilities of this car are outstanding. at first, i bought this vehicle for its unique looks. once i drove it i saw why many people have one. it handles very well and can maneuver in any types of conditions. 

 i love the front bucket seats which are very comfortable and soft. the only problem with the car is that there is no room in the back seats. in my wrangler i dont usually have people in the back seats i make it my storgae area. to drive this vehicle is so much fun. their are so many things that are capable of being done in this vehicle. 

 people who are looking for a good handling car and a unique look should buy this car.  first drivers should not though. even though this car has a roll cage and is safe in rolls is because since it rolls VERY often it must be safe to roll. the doors are very thin and even in low speed accidents there is still a chance of injury. anyone from teenagers to adults can find somthing they like about the Jeep Wrangler.<br><br>
