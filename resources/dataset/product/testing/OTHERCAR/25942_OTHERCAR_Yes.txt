            I have never experienced the pure joy of driving until I test drove this car.  My joy multiplies everyday.  I have the Pontiac Grand Am GT 4 door Sedan.  She is sleek, sexy and powerful.  Sometimes after detailing I love just to look at her.  Her styling and sportiness take my breath away.  The comfort of the interior is amazing but with the amazing space like dashboard you are definitely not driving your old man's car.  This car has complete command of the road with the wide track suspension.  She is sure footed on the road despite the conditions and gives me a sense of safety and security.  One of my complete joys of driving this car is my ability to look in my rear view mirror and see all the rest of the cars still at the light.  My gas mileage is great for the power this car has.  The features in the cockpit like interior are molded so that my hand does not slip or slide, not to mention that everything is in reach which makes all the features easily useable.  I am a man who can afford any car he wants, and let me tell you I drove them all none offered the power comfort and pleasure of this car.  Who should buy this car?? Anyone who wants to put the joy back into driving.  Who shouldn't buy this car? Anyone who thinks a car is for getting from point A to point B!!!

P. S.  I was prepared to buy a new stereo cause I know that most factory stereos in cars suck.  Not in my baby 6 speaker strong with CD.  GOD!!! I LOVE THIS CAR!!<br><br>
