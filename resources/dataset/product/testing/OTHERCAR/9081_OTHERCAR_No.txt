            We drove off the lot paying 16K for a brand spanking new Kia sportage, 4 door, 2wd model. I test drove the vehicle on a Saturday evening (9 months pregnant) and in haste I bought the car. I was hurled into labor Saturday night after driving the vehicle home and hitting bumpy roads. It acts like a truck. Don't buy it for luxury but buy it for it's off road capabilities. 

2 months after buying the vehicle, the A\C leaked.

3 months later..dead battery

4 months later...a\c problems

5 months later...radio mal-functions. left front speaker is popping

6 months later..much wind noise from back rear windows

7 months later...tire latch is not clicking

This car is made cheaply to be sold cheaply. It has been the money pit since we drove off the lot. We decided to try to trade it in considering all the problems we had endured with the vehicle. We still owe 15K for the vehicle and it only has 20K miles on it. It &quot;appraised&quot; at 7K. I was LIVID!

The worst design on the 1999 model has to be the cup holders. Why on earth would someone put cup holders in front of the ONLY two vents that blow the underpowered a\c? Is it to keep your warm drinks cool in the summer and your cold drinks hot in the winter? It totally blocks the vents air from getting to YOU...<br><br>
