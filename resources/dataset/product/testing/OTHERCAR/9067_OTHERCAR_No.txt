            This is my second time to write an opinion on the KIA SPORTAGE.  Our Sportage has been one nightmare after another.  

Recently our KIA went into the shop again (9th time in 1 1/2 years).  I came out last week to leave for work and the car wouldn't start.  A neighbor offerred to give me a jump and so I observed carefully as he hooked up the jumper cables first on his car red to red and black to black and then the same on my car.  He started his car and we waited a few minutes.  I climbed inside my car and try to get it to start. Nothing, well nothing that is except for the jumper cables began to melt.  I called roadside assistance and proceeded to have my car towed to the service department.  

After keeping my car for 3 days they determined that the problem was &quot;Only the battery&quot;.  It seems that the KIA batteries are just as crappy as their cars.  Did you know that your battery is only warrantied for 1 year full replacement and then 50% the second year and 75%(your cost) the third year.  That doesn't sound too bad until the service tech tells you that the KIA battery costs $80.00.  $80.00 for a battery that lasted a lousey year and a half?  I attempted to get the required info so that I could buy my battery else where.  I didn't mind spending the money but I wanted a good battery.  My service tech tried to tell me that you couldn't get a KIA battery anywhere else.  THAT IS A LIE!! While the service rep doesn't makes it very difficult to get the necessary information to call around and look for a battery (most auto parts companies don't have the battery for a 1999 SPORTAGE listed) it can still be done.  Infact if you are having this problem here is the info you need- The battery must be 650 cranking amps 
The rest is relatively simple, it needs to be the same in size and make sure the posts can be reached by the cables (sounds simple but it gave us a bit of trouble).

Well after replacing the battery and listening to the emphatic denials of our service tech as to there being an electrical problem that caused our battery to die, we left for home only to discover that the interior light was nolonger working along with our automatic locks, dash clock, or radio.

I guess we will be making trip #10 to the service department of KIA.   PLEASE LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IF YOU ARE THINKING KIA, THINK AGAIN!!!<br><br>
