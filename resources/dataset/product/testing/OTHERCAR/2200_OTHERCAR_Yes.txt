            HISTORY

  First of all, I got an outrageous deal on my white '93 Prelude Si early in the summer of '00.  The guy was moving to Germany and needed to get rid of it, so I talked him down to $7100 for the car, which had 85,000 miles at the time.  As near as I could tell, book value on the car was around $9000.  I have since put 5,000 miles on the car, and while that's not a great deal of time behind the wheel, I have a pretty good feel for what's right and wrong about this car.
  
DON'T BUY AN INTEGRA OVER A PRELUDE UNLESS IT'S A GSR!

  The car I owned previously was a '94 Acura Integra LS coupe.  The Acura's hatchback was convenient, but if this car is on your list of potential purchases, I strongly encourage you to look into the availability of '92-96 preludes in your area.  Briefly, I had a handful of problems with my Acura - none of which involved reliability, of course, as it was a Honda product.  First of all, I began to realize before too long that the Acura is not a sports car.  It handles pretty well, but the engine could only be described as 'peppy' - nothing more.  It's essentially a Honda Civic with a slightly larger engine and a hatchback.  So, what does that mean for other areas of performance?  Well, the single biggest problem I had with the Acura was its behavior at highway speeds.  Once this thing got over 65, wind noise and engine drone drowned out not only the music, but any conversation short of a two-way screaming match.  It felt like an economy car on the freeway, and the interior wasn't much more than economy car-level - the center instrument stack, for instance, is canted toward the passenger instead of the driver.  What's up with that?  Acura engineers were out to lunch on this one.  And the car was also aqua-colored and had the cheesy factory plastic wheel covers, so it wasn't particularly attractive save for the cool headlights, which drew me to the car in the first place.  Please, if you're going to get an Integra, make it the GS-R (which was out of my price range at the time); that way, at least you'll have some impressive performance to counteract the other stuff.

OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE

  So anyway, I decided to sell the Acura, and when I drove this Prelude for the first time, I was surprised by how different the cars felt from each other, despite their ostensible similarities on paper.  The Prelude Si makes 160 horsepower from its 2.3L engine, and coming from the Integra's 1.8L, 140-hp unit, I definitely noticed a substantial difference.  The Prelude gives you a cool sound when you push it; it faintly resembles a supercharger-whine, and it sounds considerably more refined than the Acura.  The test-drive was all I needed to convince me that the Prelude was the car I wanted.
  After 5,000 miles, I am not at all disappointed.  First of all, I'll say this: the car looks great.  The overall shape is clean and beautiful to look at from all angles, and the 92-93 Si's got excellent alloy wheels - better than the 94-and-up style, I think - that really distinguish this car from the pedestrian S-model.  Mine has the spoiler, as well, which complements the styling very well, I think - but the Prelude would still be a sweet-looking ride sans wing.

INTERIOR

  The interior is where opinion is most divided on this car.  As you probably know, Honda, in its redesign of the Prelude before the '92 model year, developed the interesting notion that the passenger should be more involved in the driving experience.  So, Prelude engineers created a display-panel that spans the entire width of the dashboard, save for the dash-mounted tweeter enclosures on either side.  Basically, the passenger has something to look at while riding - that was the idea.  The fuel gauge and temperature gauge are centrally-located, and other warnings light up in that general area as well.  The clock was given the goofiest location of all - almost directly in front of the passenger.
  So, it's a little quirky, but the interior layout is otherwise very clean, and I kind of like the digital fuel and temp readouts.  Also, there's a shelf in front of the display panel that similarly spans the entire width of the dashboard, and I have found this shelf to be indispensable as a substitute for drink-holders - of which, of course, there were none in Preludes until the '94 model year, I believe.  While we're on the topic, I should say that there really is hardly any storage space of any variety in the Prelude, and this might be an important consideration for some.  Personally, I only wish that Honda had thought to include an armrest, which I think was also unavailable until '94.  The trunk can hold a couple golf bags, the back seat can hold two reasonably-proportioned people for short trips, and the map pockets hold just about anything else I need to stow away.  So if you're like me, you don't need that much room for stuff, and the Prelude will do just fine.  But if you need to be transporting more than two people fairly long distances on a consistent basis, or if you plan on using your Prelude as a means of transporting large quantities of goods from one place to another, you might be best served by looking elsewhere.
  As far as the other stuff goes, the climate controls are perfect and within easy reach, and the shifter is pleasantly stubby, with a comfortably-shaped grip-knob.  The seats are also well-executed, although I could go for a little more lumbar-support in the driver's seat than Honda's little lumbar-adjustment lever provides.  The seats are low, of course, but they're supposed to be - it's a sports car.  I'm 6'1&quot;, and the interior of this car fits me like the proverbial glove.  The prominent side-bolsters deserve mentioning here: they do a superb job of keeping the driver planted during hard cornering, and even when you're cruising down main street, the lateral snugness of the seat never lets you forget you're in a sports car.  
  The power window and door-lock switches are ergonomically questionable - mounted on the side of the door-panels such that you have to contort your hand to operate them - but there's not enough room on the door armrests to put them there.  It's a flaw, I suppose, but you get used to it.  If you want perfectly-placed window switches, try the Acura.
  My only major problem with the interior is the sound system.  I've heard good Honda systems - my mom's '94 Accord EX, for example - but the Prelude's is not one of them.  The speakers were in rough shape in my car due to some hard use, but I could tell that even in their prime they weren't anything special.  I replaced the head unit and stuck a bazooka tube in the back to go with some bargain-basement JBL speakers in the factory locations, and the overall effect isn't bad.  You can do this by yourself without too much difficulty, by the way - don't waste your money on paying Circuit City a fortune to install the components.  Anyway, if you're even somewhat of an audiophile, plan on upgrading your Prelude system from its factory equipment.  
  
PERFORMANCE

The engine has pretty good power.  0-60 takes about 8 seconds, but that's because second gear's only good for 56, so the extra shift costs the car a good chunk of time.  It feels quicker than that time would indicate.  When you drop it into third gear at speed, you've got some pretty strong passing power, which is a pleasant surprise from an engine this size.  And, there's a good reserve of torque available at speed in ANY gear, so that even when you prod the accelerator in fifth gear, you feel an eager tug from the engine.  Also, if you're going up a hill at 60 in fifth gear, for instance, you can maintain velocity without downshifting - another pleasant surprise from a four-cylinder.  This is because the Prelude's peak torque is generated at an RPM level that is much lower than the typical Honda product.  If you're tired of having to ram your Civic EX into third gear at 65 to get any passing power, the Prelude Si will be a breath of fresh air. 
  The shifter itself seems to shift by telepathy: the clutch resistance is ideal and the shifter action is precise.  The throws are short, but not ridiculously so, and I have never had trouble locating a gear when I need it.
  Considering the performance this car gives you, the gas mileage is very good.  I have never averaged less than 27.5 miles per gallon in any kind of driving.  I can't speak for fuel economy with the automatic, but I have been quite satisfied with this aspect of my manual-transmissioned Prelude.       
  My main quibble with the engine is its high-revving nature.  On the highway, as expected, the Prelude is not a Lexus - a fair amount of wind and tire noise intrudes.  But that's no big deal; my problem is with the fact that the Prelude Si's turning almost 3600 RPM at 70 mph.  That means you're hitting 4000 by 80, and THAT means that while the Prelude is very solid at high speeds (I had it going 125 for a brief freeway stretch and the car was planted), once you hit 80 or so you're going to be inundated with engine drone.  Now, this is a sports car, so I can forgive highway noise - but I really wonder why Honda didn't give this car a 6th cog in its gearbox.  With 6th gear serving as an overdrive to keep freeway revs down, engine noise would not be an issue even at 90, and the Prelude would not only be a fast car, but it would also be a comfortably fast car.  As it is, the '94 Accord EX sedan is more comfortable to drive at 90 mph from a cabin-noise standpoint.  But the Prelude's very solid at high speeds, like I said, so it's a tradeoff.  
 
HANDLING

 The handling, finally, is probably the best aspect of this car.  I would be surprised if the Prelude Si couldn't outcorner all but a handful of the 2000-model year offerings available today.  It feels like a go-kart around even the sharpest curves, with a minimum of body lean.  I have never been able to make the tires squeal in cornering, and it's not for lack of effort - I've taken some pretty intimidating corners at some pretty crazy speeds in this car, and it just eats them up.  For the price, you absolutely will not be disappointed with this car's handling.
  

  One final recommendation: don't buy the automatic - you'll be missing out.
