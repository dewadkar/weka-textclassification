            There is a very definite reason why you see so many Sunfire's on the road...they are sporty and economical cars. The 2001 model is no exception to this.

I have a very personal story regarding a 2001 Sunfire, because I survived an accident with a transport truck in one.  Travelling to work one morning on the highway which I usually travel, a transport truck suddenly changed lanes while I was travelling in the next lane, right beside him. I had to brake quickly and try to manouever to get out of his way.  I could not get out of the way and collided with him, I went into a spin and went through the median and into the opposing lanes of traffic luckily, I was able to avoid hitting anyone else. I was so thankful for the air bag, because it kept me from banging around the car, and I feel that the ABS brakes had a part in helping me to steer the car out of further trouble.  It all happened so fast, and was very scary.  I'm thankful for the thoughtfulness which GM puts into its vehicles.

In addition to being a very safe car, this is also a very sporty and economical car.  The new front and rear fascia for 2001 really add to the sporty appearance of this vehicle. If you are looking for performance , I would recommend going with the 5 speed getrag transmission in this car, because it really zips.  This is a fun car to drive and it doesn't break the bank.
