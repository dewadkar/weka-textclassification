            I just bought my second miata after 9 years. Why?  Because I loved the first one.  That one, by the way, has now become my husbands.  This is one of the reasons I love the car.  After nine years it still looks great and most people think it's a new car.  Yes, some changes have occurred in the new model but not enough for most people to distinguish.  The new one is faster but still has all the spunk I love. It's a great car for handling and for zipping around town.  I have also taken a 6000 mile tour with the car and loved every minute of it.  It's stylish, peppy and most of all just fun to drive.  The maintenance has been minimal and that just adds to the enjoyment.  While it may be a little small for people like my 2 sons who are 6'5&quot; they seem to want to borrow it a lot.  If you like fun cars and liked to be looked at a lot this is the car for you.<br><br>
