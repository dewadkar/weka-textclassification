              I have recently traded in my S-10 pickup.  My main reason was that I became more and more uncomfortable driving the vehicle in 'bad' weather.  In my experience, the S-10 is too light in the back end and it slips and slides all over the road.  Mine was a '96 extend cab with a six cylinder.  I thought the truck would be great, it was small, economical and I could use it for the work I wanted to do in the yard of my new house.    Unfortunately, any time the roads became even just a little damp the rear end of the truck would fish-tail and the truck was prone to begin sliding.  I even changed the type of tires and this didn't help.  The only thing that did help this was keeping sand bags and/or chopped wood in the back end of the truck near the tail gate to help keep the rear end from sliding around on the damp roads....I don't even want to get into how it handled in icy/snowy conditions...just suffice to say I had to travel in these conditions last Christmas and I traded the vehicle this last summer.
I have driven other pickups but don't remember these kinds of issues.  To be fair, I didn't own the vehicles and didn't drive them in all kinds of weather and road conditions and can't comment on how the S-10 truly compares to the performance of other makes and models of small pickups in inclement conditions.
Other than the inclement weather/road handling the vehicle was great and I enjoyed it but had to trade it because I just wasn't comfortable in it with as much traveling as I do.<br><br>
