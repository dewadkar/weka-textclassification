            I never heard or seen of a Digital camera until I bought my Relisys (Dimera 3500) Digital Camera about two months ago. A dear friend of mine showed me a digital camera. I was truly astonished at what I saw before my eyes. A BRAND NEW WORLD!!! Acquiring a digital was my next project. I searched around different shops unsure as to which to buy and at that moment, frustrated and all I left. I was cruising that night on the internet hoping and praying. I looked on the Yahoo! Auctions and saw the Relisys (Dimera 3500) Digital Camera. I said what the heck it seems to me to be a good camera from the way my friend was talking. So I took the plunge and bid on the camera. I won the camera and got the 4 meg memory. Let me say this I MADE NO MISTAKE HERE BUYING THIS CAMERA!! It produces sharp, clear, clean &amp; vivid pictures. I use my camera all the time. The best thing I love about this camera is the fact it needs &quot;NO FILM&quot;! A regular camera requires film, developing &amp; lots of money. Only to have some of the pictures not turn out as good, some are blurry or the lighting is all wrong. What costly mistakes!! With a Digital Camera you can take all the pictures you want and edit out the bad ones at mere fractions of the cost with a regular camera. This camera is so easy to use that even a child could work it and all in the privacy of your own home! So if you looking for a GOOD &amp; RELIABLE camera look to the Relisys Family of Camera's. You find your answers there!<br><br>
