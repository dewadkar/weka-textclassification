            The Forester L has a whole lot going for it.  My wife and I did an exhaustive search (I guess I was the one who exhausted her and myself) for a car that possessed the handling of a four-wheel drive without the heavy price tag.  

We test drove the Honda CRV (felt a bit tinny), the Kia Sportage (nothing but tinny) and the Subaru Forester.  The Forester was a true winner with us as well as most of the car-buying guides that we read.  I�m 6�-3� and used to driving an 89 Jeep Grand Wagoneer (with paneled sides to boot) and was a little skeptical about downsizing to a smaller vehicle.  My skepticism stopped after taking the car for a spin, the headroom is excellent for a small car and the legroom is not all that bad either.

The Forester feels surprisingly large inside and its big windows are great when traveling long distances (if you�re a rubber-necked scenery gaucher like I am you�ll appreciate it).  Handling is responsive and downright fun on curving country roads.  Acceleration is ample and the ride is quiet even at high RPM. The seats, although a bit hard, have worked out well over long distances.  We�ve put 12,000 miles on the Forester in the six months since we have owned it and driven on dirt roads, through heavy snow and even on sandy beaches.   I�m happy to report that to date we have had no problems since the day we bought it, even after the dealership overfilled the oil by two quarts (don�t forget to check your own oil). The only mild negatives that I can think of are poor legroom in the rear seats (par for the course in this class), a tricky clutch (this 5 speed took some getting use to) and poor quality floor mats (have not held up well but the rear cargo liner sure makes up for it).  

If you�re looking for a good quality, safe, fun to drive car/SUV then this is one vehicle you should at least take for a spin.
