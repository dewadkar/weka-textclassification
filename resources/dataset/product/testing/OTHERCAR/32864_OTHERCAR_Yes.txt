            over all:
Nikon 880 carries on the reputation of great nikon optics and design. over image quality is great, as long as the image compression is at fine or higher. 

design:
camera body is very compact, I wish it has a pivoting lcd viewfinder, as nikon 990 or the canon g1. you do have to remember to set control dial to play or setup, to avoid accidentally turn on the camera with lens cap on - it will jam the lens, though it happens quite a lot of time, and did not really do any damage to mine.

control:
I did notice some unreliability of shutter control to hold "half way". so when you are getting a new one, test it out. on some cameras, you can not hold halfway at all. it's important when you want to hold the focus, etc.

optics:
good overall, does have noticeable barrel distortion, but ok for most of the landscapes shots. fast zoom control, yet focus is a little slow. macro function is amazing, you can get easily great photo close-up stills. and available lens accessories shared with nikon 990 are very useful, ability to scan slides is truly unique, and the results are quite ok.

battery life:
2 rechargeable batteries are expensive investment, but absolutely essential for serious shooters, and should be enough for a whole day field trip. overall, battery life is very good.

expections:
rotatable lcd viewfinder - already realized in the new model
a easy way to attach a filter lens - this represent a problem for most of the compact digi. cams. with retractable lens.
