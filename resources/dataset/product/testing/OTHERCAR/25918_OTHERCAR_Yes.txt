            When considering a family van as your next vehicle, don�t overlook the Chevy express 1500.
 This versatile vehicle, which comes in many conversion packages could be your best choice.

The 1500 Express comes with a standard 4.3 vortic engine. The engine supplies more than 200 horsepower and is not under powered as long as nothing is being towed.

Bought with a conversion package from any independent supplier, the van comes with a tremendous array of equipment that if purchased separately would add thousands to the purchase price.
Air conditioning, power steering, power ABS brakes, tilt wheel and cruise control, along with AM/FM 6 speaker cassette, TV, VCP, retractable rear bed, and 4 captains chairs, are usually included in most conversion high top packages.
Wide open space behind the rear seat provides enough room for a lawn mover if needed.

The ride of the 1500 Express van is very smooth on the open roads. Handling is very car like.
The truck frame the vehicle is built on however does provide a stiffer bounce when a bump or pothole is hit. The van rides high on the road so spot mirrors are needed to see the cars below you.

The vehicle will accommodate 7 passengers with great comfort. The interior is very bus like. One can stretch their legs out and not touch the seat in front of them.

Many safety features are included in the base price. ABS brakes are standard along with daytime running lights and duel air bags.
Insurance costs are very low.
 
Compared to any mini-van, the Express van is a true value. It�s overall size and comfort and features makes the mini van shadow behind. Used as a vacation or open road vehicle the gas mileage will be about 20 mpg. On the flip side, if used for shopping around town, don�t expect to get more than 15 mpg. The gas tank is 31 gallons so you won�t fill up every week, but when you do, expect sticker shock at the pump.

Overall I would rate this vehicle as one of the best bargains around and can�t quite understand why anybody would settle for a mini-van when these vans are available at about the same price or less.<br><br>
