            Maybe my camera does not work as well as the others that I have seen posted here.  I have read a lot of reviews that people are happy with the pictures their Fuji MX-1200 takes.  They even say that the pictures can be printed on camera quality paper and that it looks as good as pictures from a 35 mm camera.  I have not had this experience.

I bought my MX-1200 for $199 from Fry's to put pics on the net for ebay auctions primarily.  My pics are always fuzzy.  I have taken pics of a Nintendo 64, a ring, and magazines, and they are all fuzzy.  You cannot read the words on the magazines unless the letters are big on the mag.  I always use fine quality, a file size of 1280 X 960, and a normal or hard sharpness.  Maybe I am don't use the flash, but if I did, I think it would flash back on the magazines because of the glossy paper.

In any event, maybe other people have a lower standard of quality for digital pictures.  My camera has been a disappointment for me.<br><br>
