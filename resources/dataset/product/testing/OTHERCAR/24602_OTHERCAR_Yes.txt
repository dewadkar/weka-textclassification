            After much disappointment with my first two cars; a 1983 Volkswagen Rabbit GTI and a 1986 Mazda B2000, I really feel like I've found a winner with my 1994 Toyota Tercel.

My expectations for the car was to get good gas mileage (I was estimating around 30-32) and to have good reliability (I didn't want to have to mess with anything except changing the oil).  In actuality, I got more than what I expected.  I drive about 40% town and 60% highway, and my car averages between 35-37mpg.  The car is 7 years old and has over 130k, and still purrs.  I haven't had to take it in for anything since I've owned it, and the only servicing done to the vehicle before my ownership was new brakes and tires. 

Another great thing about the tercel is the amount of space for its class.  It is true that the car isn't made for large people in the backseat, but it does fit many different types of adult bodies in the backseat.  My model is four door, which increases the accessibility of the backseat and getting in and out of the car.  The front bucket seats have plenty of room and are overall very comfortable.  I wouldn't suggest this car for cross country family vacations, nor is it made to accomplish such a feat, however, it is comfortable for up to a days worth of driving.  The backseats fold down to increase trunk size, which I may add is very roomy once again for it's class.

My model is also the 5-speed 4-cylinder.  Not much to remark on here other than it is quite peppy and has no problem getting up hills.  This car doesn't have much torque, but that isn't needed.  You wouldn't want to pull anything with a Tercel anyway.  But on the highway, you can shift down and pass cars going uphill if necessary.

One last thing I feel that is important to mention is the handling.  This car is capable of making very sharp turns and is very nimble on its wheels.  Even if a sudden hard braking is needed to avoid something in the road, the car still manuveurs around the object well without sliding or losing control.

This car deserves to be looked at if you are shopping for something economical to serve you well into the future.  It is a great pick for college students who want to travel back and forth to home occasionally on weekends.  If you are looking for a car from the economical small passenger class, I insist that you at least test drive this car before you buy any other.
