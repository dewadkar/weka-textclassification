            Two years ago I got a job 35 miles from my home, so I went looking for a small FWD car like a Civic that would be easy on gas. 

I stopped at my bank and they had my '92 Pathfinder as a repo. When I drove it, I could tell it had been seriously neglected yet it ran GREAT in spite of having 120,000 miles on it. 

At the time I thought of 4WD as a nice little plus. I bought it for the bargain price of $3500, put about $1000 in repairs into it (brakes, alignment, tune-up etc.) and off I went. 

Needless to say, I LOVE THIS CAR! The 3 litre engine is smooth as silk, has plenty of passing power and doesn't use a drop of oil! It handles like a slot car, and since I've owned it, I haven't missed one minutes work due to the weather. It also gets 20 MPG, so I can afford to put 20,000 miles a year on it. 

I am a complete 4WD convert and will never own another 2WD vehicle again. I've driven down roads with a foot of snow on them without ever feeling loss of control. 

The only negative things about this car is that parts and service are much higher than American cars. I had to have the transmission rebuilt at 140,000 miles and it cost me $2500, OUCH. 

I would recommend this car to anyone who lives in the snow belt like me (Michigan). Bottom line, I've got $7000 in my Pathfinder and I'm STILL under Blue Book, not that I'd ever sell it.<br><br>
