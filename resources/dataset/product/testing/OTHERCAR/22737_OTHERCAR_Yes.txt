            Time:  1997
Place:  Somewhere, IL
Situation:  After 6 1/2 years of loyal service, my 150,000+ mile Thunderbird was begging for euthanasia.  A new (or used) car was needed... fast!

In the spring of 1997, I purchased a black Grand Am GT. This car had the 4-cylinder and a 5-speed manual transmission... everything I wanted!  I'll cut to the chase:

The Good:

The Grand Am has the aggressive styling trademark to Pontiac vehicles.  The car has foglights, alloy wheels, ground effect panels, and a rear spoiler, which give it a sporty, performance-minded appearance.  On the road, the car handled extremely well.  Tight corners were no problem, although the suspension was a little stiff.  However, that's exactly what I wanted.  The clutch was a little on the stiff side, but engaged positively.  The five-speed transmission was a LOT of fun and was conveniently located.  The car had a LOT of storage space in numerous nooks and crannies.  In addition, the front wheel drive handled extremely well in the snow and ice.  Seats were comfortable as well.  Gauges were layed out well and were easy to read in day and night.  

The Bad:

The 4-cylinder engine ran at high RPMs on the highway, which added a lot of engine noise.  In addition, for being a 4-cylinder, the gas mileage wasn't that hot.  

The Ugly:

Alas, the car was totaled in an accident outside of Columbus, OH, and left for dead (weep!).  

Summary:

I LOVED this car!  It had a light, nimble look and feel to it, which corresponded on the road as well.  Storage was extremely generous in a car of this size, and it had all sorts of places in the cabin for &quot;stuff.&quot;  I wish this car hadn't been totaled in an accident; I'd still be driving it today.<br><br>
