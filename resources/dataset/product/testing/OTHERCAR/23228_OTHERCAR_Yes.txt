            I bought my 1996 Plymouth Breeze 2 years ago. When I was looking 
for a vehicle I was looking for something with room but not too 
big to drive.  I also had a mother who was elderly whom i needed 
to drive places sometimes.  So I needed a vehicle that was easy for 
her to get in and out of.  My Breeze fit the bill.  The front seats
adjust up and down so I could set the seat up and get her in the car
and adjust it back down.  Also I am short so it helps me to sit up 
higher.  Since I bought my vehicle I have taken several trips and the 
ride on the interstate is outstanding.  I made a great choice.
