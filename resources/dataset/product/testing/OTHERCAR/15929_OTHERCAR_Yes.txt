            I must admit, the day that the dealer told me I was approved for my new car, I about fell out of my chair. There is was, my dark green 4-door sedan. It's the simple model, standard locks, auto transmission, A/C, and a CD/Radio player. Nothing snazzy, but it starts (which is a lot better than my previous cars), and it has great gas mileage (about 18/mpg city). 

This year's Cavalier has a newer look than previous years- the body is the same, but the front end slopes more like a Lumina, and the back end is a bit more moulded. It is still sleek, and not designed to comfortably seat anyone over 6 feet tall. The interior is very nice, with a nice dash design so that everything is easily accessible while driving (at least, to my 5'7" frame). The 4-cyl engine has nice pick-up, without being too powerful. It runs quietly, also, which is nice when you have a sleeping puppy on your seat that you do not want to disturb.

This car also has, like most new cars, daytime running lights, which can take a while to get used to. The console has a great display, which is easy to read. On my model, there is an RPM, gas, MPH, and temperature gauge, as well as the ever-present daytime running light symbol. If you do not buckle-up, the seat belt light also flashes non-stop until you latch your buckle, which I find rather nice. 

Steering is a dream, as the car is easy navigable and handles very well on both the side-streets and the freeway. There are no significant blind spots to speak of, and should the worst happen, driver and passenger airbags are equipped. In the back seat, there is a roomy design, and the seat splits so that an already large trunk can be modified to accommodate those longer items. 

The only downside that I have to this vehicle is my radio; it seems that the tuner is horrible and fades in a very subtle (yet ANNOYING) manner whenever the car is moving. So far the dealership has done nothing but insult my intelligence as to the cause of this problem, yet when I do find out, I will update this post.

The cost of this vehicle makes the car a great buy for any person on a moderate budget that would like a dependable car. It also looks great, which works to anyone's advantage. Lastly, if you would like to save money with those ever-rising gas prices, this car is great for you.
