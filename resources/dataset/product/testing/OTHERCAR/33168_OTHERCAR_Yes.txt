            I just recently test drove a Pacifica here in Wiesbaden Germany, and must say that I enjoyed it.  Although I read over 50 plus reviews on the Internet regarding poor acceleration and poor rear vision.  I was pleased with the performance the vehicle displayed on the Autobahn.  I pushed the Pacifica to 100 MPH with less effort than several sedans I've driven in the past.  Obviously, because of the weight of the vehicle, I did not experience 0 to 60 in 6 or 7 seconds, but while entering the autobahn and passing vehicles, I was never placed in a challenged situation.  The Pacifica performed these tasks very well.  

It was a little challenging having to back out of narrow places, but with time, this will become easier to do.  I have also driven sedans with this type of limited view to the rear.  In time, you get used to backing out of tight spots and parallel parking.  

I really enjoyed the test drive.  The handling of the vehicle was almost, if not like, a BMW.  And it was relatively quiet, even at 100 MPH.  The short, sharp curved off ramps were no challenge at all.  

My Pacifica will arrive in February...I can't wait.  The vehicle has got a lot to offer, and proved to me that it can run with the big boys here in Europe.
