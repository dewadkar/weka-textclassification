            I have had my Toyota RAV4 for just over one year and love it! Living in Colorado, it is a great vehicle for the snowy days. It is higher off the ground than the Subaru Forester, but not as difficult to maneuver as a full-size sports utility vehicle. I have the Limited edition and it has 4-wheel drive and traction control, which was very important in my choice for a snow vehicle. I don't imagine the RAV4 would be particularly good in the mountains because of the inclines. It is a bit under-powered for those who appreciate reaching high speeds in record time. I would recommend it to those individual looking for a reliable vehicle in inclement weather, who do not need a powerhouse.<br><br>
