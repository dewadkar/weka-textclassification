            On-going problems with alignment in my '99 Sienna 5-door CE cause me to give a guarded recommendation on the Sienna.  In an 18-month period, we had continued pulling to the right with final tire replacement.  This did not correct the problem, however.  In addition, we've had the rear brake drums replaced after the van shook violently during highway travel.  The inner tie rods were replaced after the steering became noisy, esp. with left turns.  The sliding doors began sticking, requiring great force to open.  The latches were replaced.  The speedometer failed to work on startup.  We now have vibrations in the van, esp. at speeds of 45-55 mph.  This makes the ride uncomfortable, and we feel most of the bumps, too.

We really like the interior of the van.  The seats are comfortable.  We have enough space, albeit legroom in the third row seat is greatly limited.  We don't see anything we like better in style/design.

Unfortunately, we have been disappointed in the quality of the van.  Because of unresolved problems, we are concerned about overall reliability now.  With the vibrations, we are beginning to hear lots of rattles now.  I am still keeping my fingers crossed, however....    <br><br>
