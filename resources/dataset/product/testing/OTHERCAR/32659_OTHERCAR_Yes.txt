            I needed a 4 wheel equivalent of a mercenary. An expendable workhorse. There to do my bidding and protect the pretty cars in the snowtime.
Well, it has done the job admirably.
I bought this baby for $3,500 with 130,000 miles on the clock.
It starts first time every time.
Heater was blowing cold but I have fixed that by flushing the radiator a few times.
The car has never failed me in the 9 months I have had it!
Car was a bit grubby when I bought it but a good clean up has given it a total new look. Interior design is now in fashion but at the time it was made must have looked incredibly old fashioned - it was retro before retro was a fashion statement.
And I use it to carry all sorts. A garden swingset from Costco. A 3 seater sofa. A cast iron barbecue. You name it Cheap Jeep lugs it everywhere.
My Cheap Cherokee has paid for itself already..and the best was that despite my neighbors obvious mirth, they were pretty happy to use it when their 1999 Pathfinder blew up.
Cheap Jeep is alright!<br><br>
