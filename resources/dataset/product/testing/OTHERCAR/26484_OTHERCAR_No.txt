            I have a '94 Chevy S-10 extended cab.  I have not had one problem with this truck as far as engine repairs and things of this nature.  The only times its been in the shop is for oil changes and rotation of tires.  My problem is that this truck is falling apart in all other aspects!!  The silver shiny trim has now started to turn brown.  Tried to get it off but found out that all the trim consist of is plastic, wrapped with a shiny foil and coated with clear plastic. So now I have dull brownish trim. The front bumper (plastic also) is starting to come loose. Rear view mirror has fallen off.  The light on the 4-wheel drive panel works in the day, but not at night so you have to turn on the interior lights to see how to put it in 4-wheel drive. Last of all the windshield wipers now only work when they want too. Which isn't too good when in traffic with heavy rain. These are not major gripes but it just seems that the truck was put together the cheapest way possible. I would not buy or recommend this particular truck again. <br><br>
