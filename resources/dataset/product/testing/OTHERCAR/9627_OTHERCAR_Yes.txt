            The 1996 4 door Tracker 4X2 isn't for everybody, but it sure is for me!  I bought mine used with 11,000 miles and looking like it had come off the showroom floor, it was really a steal for $6,700.  

The Tracker doesn't have the sleek aerodynamics of a fighter jet. In fact, the aerodynamics are roughly equivelant to a brick which gives it massive amounts of headroom and enough windows to supply a 3 bedroom house.  The styling is more on the order of &quot;rugged chic&quot; with a hint of environmental responsibility.  The square lines and flat surfaces contribute to a moderate amount of wind noise, a slightly top-heavy feeling, and moderate instability in crosswinds.  Nothing serious but be advised that this is not a sports car.  The handling is that of a SUV.

The power is supplied by a 1.6 liter engine producing 95 HP.  The Tracker is not overpowered but it certainly has enough power to cruise at highway speeds and takes city driving easily in stride.  The 5 speed manual transmission is light and crisp and the clutch is light but positive.  My highway fuel economy is 32+ MPG at 65 MPH and 25 MPG in the city.  I haven't tried pulling a trailer with the Tracker and I wouldn't recommend it unless the trailer was under 500 lbs.  The 1500 lb. capacity stated by the manufacturer seems overly optomistic.  It should be noted that with the big windows the A/C has to work overtime.  On hot sunny days it could really use a bigger A/C unit.

In conclussion...would I buy another Tracker....yes!  The style is right for me.  It's a functional SUV with some limitations.  As long as you keep the vehicles obvious limitations in mind it really does it's job well.
