            I bought this digital camera about 7 or 8 months ago. It is my first digital camera, and I consider myself to be a &quot;novice&quot; photographer. I have always used either a 110 or 35mm point &amp; shoot camera before. I got the digital because I wanted to take pictures of stuff I was selling at an online auction, and because I wanted to be able to email pictures to my family. 

I did a lot of research online, and found a great camera review site that has actual user's reviews as well as the &quot;professional publication&quot; reviews (www.pcphotoreview.com). I was originally looking at the Polaroid digital because a friend had it, and he thought it was great. Wish I would have known about epinions then...could have gotten even more user reviews here.

After I read the reviews for all the cameras in my price range (mid), I decided the D340-R was the best value for the money (I did shop around online and got a very good price for this model), as well as being from a reputable and reliable camera maker. The clincher was that every review talked about how seldom the camera's batteries had to be changed and how easy it was to get the pictures from the camera to your pc. 

The reviews were correct. I can get up to 70 pictures on one set of NiMH batteries when I don't use the LCD display. With the LCD display on, I get about 30 pictures. To save battery life the camera shuts off by itself if not used for about two minutes. It is also extremely easy to get the pictures from the camera to my laptop. I just plug in the cord, open the software and click on &quot;download pictures&quot;. They download in a very short time. I did about 90 pictures on Christmas, and it took about 4 minutes to download. 

I am also very impressed with the quality of pictures that I have gotten with this camera. Even on the lowest quality setting, the pictures are as good or better than the ones I used to take with my &quot;cheapie&quot; cameras. Also, I can take several shots, and then delete the ones that do not turn out well. I have printed a couple on non-photo quality inkjet paper, and they are even ok on that, especially if you put them &quot;under plastic&quot; (like in a sheet protector or a frame). 

The only thing I did not like about the camera was that I had to get used to putting my finger on the &quot;red bump&quot; on the front. It is a bump that is specifically put there to rest the finger. If you forget, you get a picture of your finger, because the lens is not in the center of the camera, but off to the left side. Once I got used to keeping my finger out of the way, I was ok. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the camera. I am able to take lots of pictures and then save them to my pc or a disk (or delete them if they are not up to par!). I liked the camera so much that I bought one for my in-laws for Christmas!<br><br>
