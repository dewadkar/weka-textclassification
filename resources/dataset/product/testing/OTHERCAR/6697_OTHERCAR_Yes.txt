            I have to admit, I had my heart set on one of these when I saw James Bond's in Goldeneye. I purchased this, used about a year ago, and have had ZERO problems with it. Although I'm not a huge fan of the color scheme in mine, (dark green and tan is fine - but the seats being dark green but the rest of the interior being tan annoys me) it is still one of the best designed cars I've ever driven... and I've driven a LOT (I've owned upwards of 30 cars in the past 10 years). 

This vehicle is exactly what I needed. Simple, well designed, and reliable. It handles like a vintage MG, without the Lucas electrical issues. 

While I'd wish there was a little more power, it's not necessarily "needed". Here are some comments on a few things: 

The Top: The back window kind of sucks, but the top overall fits well, with little to no rain ever getting in. It is a simple operation and takes about 5 seconds to get up or down with one arm. 

The interior: Everything is pretty well placed. At 115,000 miles, my interior still looks fantastic. 

The paint: Ditto above, though I think mine's been stored in a garage most of its life. 

The engine: Blah... but it looks SOOO good, who cares? 

Tires: Stick with the Michelin Pilots that came OEM. They are a great tire, but a little bit pricier than most. 

Wheels: No corrosion, though the stickers in the caps could have been real emblems rather than just stickers. 

Radio: Not a big fan of music, but I understand they all come stock with a halfway decent tape deck that is pre-wired for a cd changer. Neato! 

MPG: I get about 28-30
