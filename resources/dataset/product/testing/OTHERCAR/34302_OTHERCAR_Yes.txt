            The Isuzu Rodeo is the best vehicle I have ever driven.  My father purchased the 1992 Rodeo brand new and it was passed down to me a couple of years later.  I still own my Rodeo with 140,000 miles under its belt.  I have no complaints about my car itself, but the paint job was bad.  I plan to fix that as soon as I can; the green paint job is turning white in some spots.  I love the room I have in my car.  I have a four wheel v6 four wheel drive.  I feel very safe in my car despite the reports of SUV's being top heavy.  I drive very carefully so I don't feel any added danger on me by driving the Rodeo.  I haven't even had anything close to what I would call a concern.  It feels great to be able to see over cars on traffic and to be able to see where you are going or who it is holding traffic up.  I believe anyone would be lucky to be able to drive a Rodeo.  If someone is a little nervous about SUV's I would suggest giving the Rodeo a try.  I think that as far as the market goes the Rodeo is a good consumer buy.  If you are a parent with a sixteen year-old driver I would suggest the Rodeo not only for its proven track record but it doesn't go as fast as the other cars on the market.  On a straight ride my car can get to 75 mph over time, but on a street drive 50 mph is pushing it.  I plan to drive my Rodeo until it just gives out and even then I've been considering having it refurbished.  I couldn't ask for more in a car and if I had to choose out of today's market my Rodeo would still be driving me home.<br><br>
