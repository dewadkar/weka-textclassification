            As the proud owner of not one but two digital cameras, I must say the Sony is my favorite! 

Of course I may never have known this had I not tried the other camera for almost 2 years. Now I loved that one too, UNTIL I saw my friend Sarah with her Sony, OH my, was it easy to fall in love with!

You can take it anywhere. It has a built in flash(the special rechargeable battery is included, with the charger)that lasts a good 2-1/2 hours, so your able to take a photo, and decide right then and there if you need to re-shoot, with the easy LCD view screen! You can even take a bunch of shots, and go back later and view them right in the cameras view finder! NO uploading the information FIRST into your computer to view!

All you use is a standard 3.5 inch floppy disk, and it's ALL saved on that! You simply remove the disk and insert it into the computer's disk drive and print, or send the photos in your email, SIMPLE!

The options are wonderful, with a zoom feature, and even choices of pictures effects like black and white and my personal favorite, sepia. This model also enables you to make 60 second movies, so it comes with a built in microphone too!
