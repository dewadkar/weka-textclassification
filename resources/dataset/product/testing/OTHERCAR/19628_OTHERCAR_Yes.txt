            I had been using a digital camera that I borrowed from a family member each time I needed one. It was a Sony Mavica, and it was great for my purposes, but it�s cost was $800+. I decided I needed a digital camera of my own, but I had to find one that suited my purposes within a reasonable price range.

I spent about a week comparing digital cameras, looking specifically for one with a good close focus (macro) range, good resolution, and optical zoom. Finding a camera with a small price tag with these features turned out to be somewhat difficult, but I happened upon the Brio D-150 and it was the camera for me.

Physical: This camera is quite compact, easily fitting into my pocket with room to spare. It fits nicely in the hand and it is so light that quick or one-handed shots are easy to do. A sliding front cover protects the lens, and when the cover is opened, the lens extends and the flash pops out. The top of the camera has the shoot button and the zoom switch is conveniently placed nearby. The back has a set of up/down/left/right buttons, an LCD on/off button, and an OK button, used to navigate the options menus. There is also the 1.5 inch (diagonal) LCD display. This is a somewhat small display, but the size of the camera prohibits a much larger screen, and the quality of the screen is pretty good. The side of the camera has a small cover hiding the USB port and the video out port. The screen can be used as the viewfinder, but to save batteries, it also includes an optical viewfinder (using the screen is required for using Digital zoom).

Resolution/Memory: The D-150 has a 1.3 MegaPixel resolution, with an option for 640x480. There is no internal memory; the camera comes with an 8Mb SmartMedia card. This is enough memory to take 24 pictures at the standard resolution, or 82 pictures at the 640x480 resolution. Quite sufficient for the casual picture-taker, but not enough for extended use without dumping the pictures to a computer, so I picked up a 64 Mb card, which allows me to take 199 pictures at the standard resolution. That�s enough for an entire vacation, and no film to process! I carry the 8 Mb card as a backup.

Zoom/Macro: One of the features I was looking for was a decent zoom and good macro function. This camera has 3x Optical zoom and 2x Digital zoom. Finding a camera in this price range with this level of Optical zoom was very nice. The 2x Digital zoom is a bonus, but is not often needed, as the Optical zoom is better and usually sufficient. It is also a bit of a chore to turn on the Digital zoom, as you have to navigate the options menu to do so. The macro function on the D-150 is pretty good, again for a camera with this price. It can focus on objects at around 0.2m.

Features/Options: The D-150 has all of the most often used features, including the afore mentioned zoom and macro as well as a sequence-shot mode (up to 4 shots at 2 fps), a 12 second timer, various flash modes (Auto, Red-eye reduction, Fill-in, and Night Scene), and an internal calendar can put the date and time on your photos. Viewing your pictures on the screen requires that you close the camera, and this is actually the only complaint I have. A nice feature, though is when you are viewing the pictures, you can see thumbnails (quite small on the little screen), and you also have the ability to zoom in on the picture you are viewing.

USB port: The USB port on the camera makes transferring the pictures from the camera to the computer very easy. Plug the camera in and it acts like another drive on your computer, so you can drag-and-drop your picture files, which are in JPEG format. The transfer rate is also quite fast.

Power supply: The camera comes with a Lithium battery, but once that is gone, batteries become an issue. The D-150 can use 2 AA batteries (NiMH, Alkaline, or NiCd) or a Lithium battery. I recommend using rechargeable NiMH batteries to minimize battery expense.
