            We love our 1992 Saturn SL2. We now have approximately 60,000 miles on it and it still runs, looks and handles like a brand new car.
We recently took a 4,000 mile trip, finding the car both comfortable and economical.              We had a problem with a faulty transmission relay in the Melbourne, Florida area on the Interstate. Noticing a Saturn billboard, we exited for service at Space Coast Saturn. The reception at the dealership was unbelievable. There we were, with an older Saturn, purchased elsewhere. Our welcome could not have been more gracious. We were asked to immediately bring our Saturn to the Service Department to be diagnosed and told it would be approximately 20 minutes. We were then escorted to a customer reception area where we were offered coffee and donuts while we waited. We received a running analysis of what the shifting problem might be, by the service personnel. Ultimately, the service manager arrived and explained the problem and the solution. The Saturn was repaired and returned to us, after having been washed and vacuumed. We were in and out in a total of 45 minutes. We have never experienced such prompt and courteous treatment by a dealership. The ads proclaiming that one is part of the Saturn family could not be any more true.
