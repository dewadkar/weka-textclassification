            Overall the camera is great. 

The good:
1. The pictures are outstanding when I compare them to my P7.  

2. The automatic settings get it right almost every time.  

3. The camera, however, let's you take full control when needed.

4. The battery will go all day.

5. The camera design.  If you like it, you will feel very natural with it.  Some people do not like it.  Make sure you hold one first.

We have taken this camera to a few different places.  Indoors the camera does really well.  The colors are realistic, and the pictures look great.  The only thing that you have to do is control the flash manually.  There are times indoors when the flash in the automatic setting wants to trigger when the pictures have better color with out.  The camera includes the ability to reduce red eye with multiple flashes from the flash, but so far the regular flash has yet to produce a picture with red eye.  Indoors we have taken pictures in low light conditions, and the camera response has been great.

Now the better.  Outdoors, you could not ask for better pictures.  The colors are very realistic and the camera is very responsive to environment changes.  The LCD on the back works in most sunlight, but on the really bright days, you are going to want to use the view finder.   From the camera design, the view finder sometimes makes it easier to find your target, since the LCD is in the middle of the camera, and the lens is on the left.

In the outdoors, we have take pictures of various things from wildlife to flowers.  The colors are true to life and amazing.  You will not be disappointed.

Ok, now for the bad.  

1. At the high resolution, the response is very slow with regular memory sticks.  However, the camera has the ability to use the new Pro memory sticks.  They are highly recommended if you are getting this camera.  With the new memory sticks, the camera works great.  The only bad thing is the new pro memory sticks are not backwards compatible.

2. Night shot.  The night shot feature is hard to use.  The automatic settings do not get this right.  You have to play around with the manual settings to even attempt to get this right.  

Wish List:
1. It would be nice if Sony dropped the night shot feature.  If it is not ready don't put it in.  This would also make the camera a little bit lighter.

2. It would be nice to have a more powerful lens.

3.Interchangeable lens (SLR...)

Bottom line
I have had this camera now for a little while, and it is great.  A huge suggestion would be to bite the bullet and get the pro memory sticks.  This will give the camera the ability to be used like it should be and will give the camera almost no lag between picture shots.

It is great camera for the price.  Make sure you shop around to find the best price.
