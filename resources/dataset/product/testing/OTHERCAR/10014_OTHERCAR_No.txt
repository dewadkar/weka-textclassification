            If you want basic transportation, the Kia Sephia is a great little package. It is a no frills car that has excellent MPG and a low sticker price about $8,999. The re-sale value is high, as there are few year old cars for less than $8,000. The paint job is good, but the interior is a bit bare. 

Do not compare this car with over $20,000 cars, as it will seem cheap in comparison. The workmanship is good. Door slams shut, windows close, without a problem. 

Although it has excellent gas mileage, the engine is a bit underpowered &quot;lawnmower&quot; and acceleration is poor. Not a good thing in city traffic. 

Another problem is that it stalls when you go over water, so remember this when it is raining.

It was quite roomy inside, even people over 6' tall can use this car, as long as they move the front seats back, this causes a problem to the person in back.

It is great as a second car for someone who does not have money.<br><br>
