              I was in the market for a newer used car with a limitation that it could not be more than 2 years old, and I had a ceiling of approximately 10,000.-11,000. cost.  Since this was a purchase being made in cash by a relative, the final decision was not mine. I spent several weeks car-shopping, and calling in my finds.  The relative making the decision owns several businesses, which require mulitiple vehicle purchases, plus travels by air freguently, so dependent on rentals, and cannot abide really small cars. There is also a person in charge of purchasing the vehicles for the businesses. 
  Personallyl, I was wanting another mini-van or perhaps even a bronco or something along those lines, having 3 kids, but also a factor the purchaser wanted was gas economy, so felt that I should get a sedan type of car.  Although they preferred the car not be smaller than a Camry (which was what they were hoping I would find, and frankly me too).
  I drove and I drove, and I looked and I looked.  The Achieva was actually the car that though I LOVED the RED exterior, I thought would not be acceptable, as it was just below the $11,000.- and then was just a year old, and having less than 36,000. miles (still under manufactorers warranty).  Even compared to smaller newer autos at a comparable price, it was the one that was decided would be best for me and my kids.  
  I am CONSTANTLY complimented on the color of Red of this car.  And also often told it is a nice car.  Mine came fully loaded with an exceptional stereo, tho cassette rather than cd(which has its own protective anti-theft safety feature).  It has the front and back shoulder seatbelts, kid door locks, driver control over windows and doors, and duo airbags.  It has and extra-traction system, and handles wonderfully.  The front lights come on automatically when the engine is started, and while it does take a bit of reminding myself to turn the lights fully on at dark, I have really appreciated this feature.  Although I have not discovered how to go around this feature, am hoping I do not have to do any 'secret spy' activity with the car, as the only way to disengage the lights, is to either turn the car off, or put it in park and set the brake.  It was only recently that I discovered that not only does one seat fold down, allowing the ease of having objects of length in the car, but both do.
My biggest complaint is that there is a worn spot on the drivers carpet on the side, and I felt that perhaps a more durable carpet could be used.
I have had to do nothing except change oil, and tuneup, and did have the front brakepads replaced one year after purchase.
  While I had never really checked out Oldsmobiles before, and was not that curious about them, after having my Achieva, I have to say that for all the 'goodies' that came with my car, the relatively 'no=headaches upkeep' and the more 'possibilities' and 'pluses' to this car, will definately help direct me to go check out Oldsmobile first. For the money, I was able to have more of the 'extras' than I would have gotten elsewhere.  My car, even being parked outside often, has maintained a very 'new' appearance, due to styling and paint.<br><br>
