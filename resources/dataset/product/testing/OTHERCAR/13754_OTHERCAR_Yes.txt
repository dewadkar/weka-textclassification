            I went to school in Eugene, Oregon, hippie-town USA.  Inevitably the culture wore off on me, and I found myself liking the VW Camper Bus in the Mid Nineties.  
But alas, I married and had children, so the venturing had to take a back seat to the practicalities of everyday travel.  Until recently...
Living in Alaska, we enjoy some of the best summers in the country, with 20 hours of sunlight, mild temperatures (mid 60s), awesome fishing, and mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds (ok, this isn't a good thing, but the fish like it.)
My Mitsu Van is my camping van.  We sojourn to the greatest fishing and camping spots, open the back hatch and enjoy the weather.  At night, we pull out the sleeping bags and lay them in the back to sleep.  I'm just over 6 feet tall and I have two feet to spare for our luggage, so this is just right. 
It's easy to get sentimental about something like this, but the vehicle has been pretty care-free.
The drive is a little rough,  I assume because I usually have it empty and the suspension needs some weight to soften the ride.  But I cannot complain much about a vehicle for which I spent 1800 bucks in 1998.

Nonetheless, you may want the details, so I'll give them to you.

The van gets between 18 and 20 mpg, which isn't bad.  I thought it would be better, considering there is nothing in the van, but the aerodynamics are poor and the engine is fuel-injected, which apparently brings down the mileage (or so my mechanic said).

Another interesting thing--this van has pickup.  I beat a dodge viper from the light with this van.  Sure, he wasn't expecting my 'earth slug' to give him a challenge, but my lane ended and I wanted to to merge left.  He quickly saw what I was up to, but I accelerated fast enough to pass him.  This was one of a few great victories in the life of my van.

The battery is behind the driver's seat.  It took me 30 minutes to figure this out after I left my headlights on at work.  This is awkward for jump starting, as you have to approach on the side if you are going to get the jumper cables to reach.  The windshield fluid is stored on the passenger side of the interior, down by the feet, don't ask me why.

Perhaps the worst aggravation I faced was changing out the alternator.  You see, the engine (like in the Toyota vans) is below the passenger seat.  It seems simple enough, but the alternator was so far below the seat that I coudn't reach it by leaning or crouching, so I suffered through a painful install of a rather simple alternator.  

Also, the vehicle had problems with rust on some of the door locks and the rear hatch.  Perhaps they didn't use stainless steel.  This is an annoyance I've dealt with by ignoring it.

By and large, though, I haven't had engine or transmission problems with this van and enjoy taking it on the road for my fishing excursions.  The style is funky, but even for such an old vehicle, I get unexpected compliments.
