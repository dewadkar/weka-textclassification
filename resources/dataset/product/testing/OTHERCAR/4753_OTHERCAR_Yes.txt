            Audi has never let me down...Please read carefully my points before purchasing one. The A4 Avant 1998 I bought had everything except the All weather package...The car is really an excellent road holder, the turns are sharp and road holding is amazing. Over all the car is great if you do not care about the following details.

If you decide to get the sports package, then be very careful since it is 20 mm lower than the normal car..This tends to scrape on some surfaces like bumps when you have 4 people in the car with stuff in the back.

The 2.8 190 hp engine is ok for over 3000 rpm, it tends to be a little slow until the torque kicks in. So if you are looking for tons of acceleration, you will not find it here. However, after 3000 rpm, it really doies fly.

The tip tronic is a great tool if you like to switch to manual without the clutch...Well, I found having 2 3 4 D on the shift knob to be a waste. Most of the time it is either on Tip Trnic or D.

Plus, when you are switching between 3rd and 4th gear, there is a slight drag that AUDI knows about but they don't fix it. They claim it is for EPA purposes, I think it is bogus.

When reversing it tends to hesitate sometimes. Now I checked this with other AUDI A4 cars in the lot. They all do the same.

There is really no leg room in the back for adults over 6.00 ft. 

The spare tire is a small one. And since it sits under the cover in the trunk, and there really no support in the trunk for heavy bags, you tend to break the plastic brackets that are holding the cover. Becareful where you place your heavy equipment. Place them in the center or to the fron of the trunk. Never in the very end. 

The gas tank is small, frequent stops at the gas station gets to be a little annoying.
The car always misfires during cold starts. They claim it is an EPA thing but why should I go to the dealer everytime it misfires.

The brakes are very dusty. You have to clean you rims constantly. You will notice it after a few drives that they become so dirty that you really do not want to drive the car after you wash it.

For some reason, the paint they use has a very thin coat on it. You get to see chips in the front after a few drives.

When you close the front doors with the windows down, you always hear rattling inside. The reason AUDI uses is that the windows are down...Well howcome this does not happen on Toyota or Honda or BMW?

If you buy Automatic and Quattro..the ar does drive like a tank...it easy really heavy.

Plus if you really do not want and AUDI but you want all the gizmos that come with like quattro etc......you could buy the same car in a Passat wagon with 5000 less than the Audi.<br><br>
