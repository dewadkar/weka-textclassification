            Have a blue 1991 Camry w/70,000 miles.  It's truly a great car.
Considered buying a new car but mechanics &amp; other old-Camry owners talked me out of it. Also when I put a sign in car window, I had 12 calls within 5 days.  So I had it looked over by a mechanic w/minor repairs made-about $800 (motor in left window had to be fixed &amp; new hoses) &amp; had it repainted a brighter blue. Also had it detailed which really spruced it up.  I think it knows I care!  Radio recently went out but I have a Toyota recall on radio card that will fix that for free. Also need to replace motor in sunroof ($400).  With regular oil changes &amp; brake checks, it will keep humming for years. Definitely a keeper!
