            I love my Forester.  I have had it since January 2000 and it's the best car I have ever had.  I bought it because I drive 40 miles round trip to work each day and needed something dependable, even in bad weather.  I had been in a minor accident in my last car and almost been involved in another accident, which sort of made me afraid of driving for some unknown reason.

I wanted an SUV, since they are sturdier and higher as I am short, but I didn't want anything too big.  This is it.  I can see better and I feel safer.  I now enjoy driving again.  It doesn't feel like I am driving a truck, it is a smooth ride.  I get about the same gas mileage as I did with my last car.  I am looking forward to my vacation this summer to see what kind of highway mileage I get.  I'm sure it will be great. 

We had a big snow storm five days after I got my Forester and I had no problem driving at all.  I got through everything.  I didn't even skid, where I saw others skidding.  It also has plenty of traction in the rain.

The seats are very comfortable for me.  I even get two adults and a child in the back seat.  There is a lot of storage space.  I got the upgraded stereo system, which isn't the greatest, but it serves the purpose for me.  

All in all, I can't really say anything bad about my Forester.  I would get another one in the future.  <br><br>
