            I had just had to write an opinion on this tank of a car... I was looking for an &quot;econo box&quot; car for my commute to work, and for out on the town at nights.  I originally wanted a sporty small car (civic, or escort) but everytime i found one, it was sold before i could get to it.  I was starting work in two days, so i had to settle for (what i thought was) a pretty lame car.  My mother found this semi-rusted Tercel, in burgundy, that she thought would be perfect.  i thought it was horrible, and when it came down to crunch time, it was the only car that i could find.  

I purchased it privatly for $1800 canadian, with 152,000 original kms on it.  when i got behind the wheel, i felt that i had made the wrong choice, but after about a week, i raised my opinion so thinking it was an average car.  

Since it was (in my opinion at that time) a junker, i treated it as such.  I ran it into snowbanks, drove over embankments, speedbumps, curbs..basically whatever i could find, as fast as i could.  Once, i ran it for three days with the oil light on, and when i checked to see how much was in there, it didn;t even register on the stick.  I've only replaced the filter once, and as for oil changes, well, i put more in when the light comes on.  After putting this car through hell for 2 years, it still runs just like the day i took ownership...almost perfectly.

Although it lacks power, the Tercel makes up for it in gas mileage.  I've only had to replace the alternator, and the muffler.  from what i hear from the &quot;experts&quot;, my car should have died years ago.  But with over 250,000 Kms on it, it still runs very smoothly, with only a few minor problems due to the carbon buildup problem that they seem to be known for.  This car is perfect for students, or for people like me, who choose to save their money so that one day, they can buy a brand new (insert toyota of choice here).  from what i've seen with my car, and my mothers Camry (which tragically was rear-ended by a semi, demolishing the trunk, but leaving my mother unscathed), i will strongly consider toyota before any other make of car, when (or if...) my tercel finally gets laid to rest<br><br>
