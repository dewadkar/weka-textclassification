            My parents had 3 kids and always had a station wagon.  When the minivans hit the market, they were hooked.  I made countless journeys throughout the eastern United States in minivans.  When I got my drivers license I had to take my test in a minivan.  I hated driving that &quot;THING&quot;.  I told my parent I would never get a minivan.  Well, that lasted for a little while.  After getting married and having three kids myself, it was time to trade in our compact car.  I was trying to convince my wife that we could all fit in an SUV or anything else but a minivan.

So, we start looking and my wife was hooked on the Quest.  I, on the other hand, hated it simply because it was a minivan.  So we bought the Quest and I have enjoyed it ever since.  We have been on at least 4 long car trips and have been able to take everything we need to take care of our kids with ease.    It offers a great ride with a lot of room.  The rear air option was a must for the comfort of our kids.  There is plenty of room for them to put their toys and drinks.  The van has been extremely reliable.  The only thing it lacks is the center console option with the TV and VCR.  The 99s now come with the center console and 5th door.

I love the rear sliding seat.  It makes it very easy to transport large items and still have room for some passengers.  Just flip up the bench seat and slide it forward.  It is just that simple.  The luggage rack adds the much needed cargo space for surviving vacation with 3 young kids.  There is no way we could fit all the essentials necessary for vacation into a compact car.

I would tell anyone who dislike minivans as much as I to buy this one.  It's not too big or not too small.  It provides the room and luxury of a minivan while still giving you the feel of a car.  It is a great value with plenty of options.  A perfect match for anyone who has to watch their budget.  It gives me the chance to allow my family to ride in comfort and still have money left over for some added luxuries.

This van must be getting pretty popular.  I keep hearing my three year old yell, &quot;Hey, they have a van like we do&quot;.<br><br>
