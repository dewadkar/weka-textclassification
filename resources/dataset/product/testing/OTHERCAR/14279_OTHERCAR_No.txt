            I enjoyed a 1995 K1500 Suburban LT for 5 years and put many highway miles on it.  This year I had an itch for something new so I started reading everything I could about the New! Suburban.  All of the reviews I read had nothing but good things to say about the new design.  I went to the dealer to see for myself and was impressed with all the improvements to the vehicle so decided to buy a 1500 2 wheel drive LT version.  When I went to pick up the new ride I was a little put off by the Firestone tires but they were not on any of the recall or alert list so I drove it off the lot.  The dealer must have put too much air in these tires because this thing rides much rougher than my old '95 but when I made it home and checked, the tires had 35psi around just like the door sticker says.  I gave it a few days til I called my salesman and said there must be something wrong with the suspension or tires or something because this thing rides worse than an Army Jeep.  I feel every crack in the concrete and even small bumps in the road bounce the rear end around. Of course mechanics can only see if there is some major problem like binding suspension parts or a part not connected properly so the diagnosis was everything was just like it should be. Somehow I expected that ostrich head in the sand mentality from the service people.  I bought it so it was my problem now not theirs.  This will be a continuing saga  and battle with Chevrolet to fix this obvious defective suspension.  If I wasn't so irritated with the ride I'm sure I would enjoy the other improvements to the Suburban.  The automatic HVAC works very nicely as do the automatic headlights.  The sound system has excellent bass for a stock system.  There are a few very small nits to pick.  I answered a survey from GM on my '95 suggesting 2 additions.  A 'dead pedal' for the drivers left foot and a remote gas cap release. Both of these are still missing.  Also the trainable Homelink transmitter for garage door opener doesn't transmit very far.  I have to be about 5' from the door for it to start to open.<br><br>
