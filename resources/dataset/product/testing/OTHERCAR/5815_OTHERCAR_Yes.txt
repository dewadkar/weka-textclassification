            This is a great camera. I researched it for months before buying it.  I bought it before my year abroad in asia, this thing has lasted me through steamy Thai jungles, Hong Kong typhoons, Canadian winters and treks through China.  It's small enough to slip into your pocket, it WILL take 128 MB smartmedia cards (which will give you around 200-300 very high quality shots), the resolution is great and it's point and shoot- any fool can operate it.  Despite what people say, if you use Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargable batteries this thing will last a good while, esp if you don't use the monitor to take your shots.  I've had it for over a year and haven't had a single problem, technical or otherwise, with it. Drawbacks: lack of manual features i.e. double and long exposure, no manual focus, etc. but if you did you'd have those cameras that you have to strap around your neck, not one that is the size of a regular 35mm point and shoot!  And it would be nice to have a direct USB port (DEFINITELY get an external card reader for the smartmedia the serial cable will have you growing a beard and watching your great-grandkids get married before it's done with even a 64 meg card) but i use it for my MP3 player and other stuff so for me it doesn't matter all that much.  anyone want samples or more details feel free to contact me
