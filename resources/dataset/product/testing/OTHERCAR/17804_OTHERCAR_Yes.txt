            A friend of mine recently got one of these for his 18th birthday and he constantly told me how much fun it was to drive.  Not satisfied by hearing about it, and armed with the knowledge that most Nissans are nothing worth writing home about, i talked him into letting me drive his new car.  Check your pre-concieved notions at the door, this is no sentra.  First we took it out to the local highway to see what we could make it do... I chickened out at about 128.  Satisfied that it was in fact a fast car we took it out to the boonies near my house and put it through some really hard corners and i was amazed at the way the car slid through the 35 mph corners at well above 70.  The car launches, stops, accelerates and corners like it's on rails.  He's had the car for about 2 months now and hasn't really had any problems with it except for tires and so on.  It gets suprisingly good mileage(20+) when driving sedately and the front seats are suprisingly comfortable.  The back seats however are rather diminuitive, but we have to keep those folded down to fit the speaker box in so it's not really a problem.  I would reccomend this car for anyone who wants a fun fast car that is capable of driving in a city or a radar trap because oddly enough, this car doesn't make you want to speed, very much unlike my  1990 Supra, in which doing 35 is damn near impossible.  The back cargo area in his liftback is pretty good if you don't carry around two twelve inch speakers, and in fact we've mangaed to carry three overnight bags and a wheelchair with the back seats in use and no speakers.  My only real complaint is that the car looks just like a ford probe or mazda mx-6 from the same era. That and the seats anyhow... they're really good at keeping you where you need to be to drive, but they are somewhat hard to relax in when riding as a passenger.<br><br>
