            I bought a 3000 GT new in 1994.  The car was one of the finest all around cars that I have ever driven.   You won't hear me ever recommending any other Mitsubishi automobile, but this car was different.  The build quality of the car is excellent and the solid feel compares to the feel of a Lexus or BMW.  

I bought the car based on the combination of performance, appearance, and the fact that it was front wheel drive.  I needed a year round automobile, and wanted something different from the rest of the bunch.  So I chose the 3000GT.  I put snow tires on the car in the winter, and never had a problem in the snow.  

In the 4 1/2 years that I had the car, I only experienced 2 problems.  The first was a horn button on the steering wheel that kept popping off, which was replaced under warranty.  The second problem arose when the car hit about 60,000 miles.  When the A/C was on, the car would idle strange and sometimes stall.  I tested the battery and alternator and both checked out OK.  I never took it to the dealer to have it checked, because I traded it in soon after that. 

The car was surprisingly comfortable, with a good ride.  The back seats were pretty much useless.  My wife and I now own a Lexus ES 300 and a BMW 328i, and on long drives, the front seats were as comfortable as either of these cars.  The only reason that I traded it in was because we had a new baby.  

I received many compliments on the car and a lot of questions like &quot;what is that?&quot;  The styling is very distinctive.  It's ashame that Mitsubishi is no longer making these cars....I would recommend purchasing a used model with low miles.  You won't be dissapointed.
