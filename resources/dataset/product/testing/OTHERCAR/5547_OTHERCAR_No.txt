            I don't know about the new Tahoes, but I had a 1997 model and I hated it!  It was a fully loaded two door with leather seats and 4x4.  I drove the thing home from Colorado to Texas.  Sixteen hours straight of driving and it wasn't a wonderful experience.  My rear end was numb fifteen minutes into the trip.  I would try to sit in different positions, but nothing worked.  I don't know if it was because it had leather seats, and that the other seats are more comfortable or what, but that particular vehicle just isn't for me. 

It over steered and I would find myself glancing at something, turning back to the road and I would be on the other side of the road!  Good thing there were no cars coming from the other side of the road!  Cornering?  Well, lets just say that I felt like it was going to flip at times.  I don't know if the newer models are better, but I guess they have to be, as I see a lot of them on the road.  I for one will never lease another one.  Once I got the chance, I got rid of it and got a Ford.<br><br>
