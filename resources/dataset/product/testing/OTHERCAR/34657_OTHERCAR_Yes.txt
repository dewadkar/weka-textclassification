            This is my second minivan. I am a DIEHARD car nut and not one to look twice at this type of vehicle. Our previous van, a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan LE was a PEACH...untill the Tourque Converter and related items took a dump just after the 36k warranty...URGH! So here we are, $1600.00 later with a car we no longer trust...and along comes the deluge of prime time TV ads for Montana and Venture type vans. The Venture was the one that got us into the showroom after dinner one Friday evening, we had just returned from a long cross country vacation and tried to use a AC/DC TV/VCR combo in the Dodge to no avail due to room. We had to load our 5 and 7yr old boys in and out of the rear hatch...it was not as nice as having the MontanaVision we now have thats roof mounted..up and out of the way! Its got the 3-way audio system that allows other passengers front AND rear control and select the source, CD-RADIO-TAPE that they want to listen to...headphone jacks outnumber cupholders! Its even got input jacks for a game system...nice indeed! The ONSTAR system rocks too...they not only can protect and service the Montana from space, but once told me i was SPEEDING...doing 80mph in a 70mph zone!
This is one decked out van at a price most minivans are anyway!
Good for you GM!
