            When I purchased the DC-215 I was very skeptical about spending this kind of money on product I wasn't sure would really be worth it.  Normally when something fairly new comes out, it is less than user friendly.

Well in the case of this camera I was very impressed.  And I still am.  I can normally fit 12- 14 photos on one disk.  Even though the thought of having to install a program on the computer just to download the images seemed like a bad idea.  It actually made it easier to work with and to adjust the picture to exactly how I wanted to see it.  The DC-215 is very easy to use and has many options.  The good thing is there isn't so many options that you walk away from it with your head spinning.  

It has the sophisticated look, the complex look.  Yet, very easy and fun.  I think the ability to zoom and view on the LCD screen is my favorite part.  It may be the simplest but none the less the part I like the most.  This camera takes very good quality pictures.  I have yet to take one that I didn't like.  And if you don't want to keep one of the pictures you can simply delete that one from the disk and move on.  

If you can afford it..BUY IT.  It is a great and fun camera that will keep you taking pictures faster than you can say film developing.<br><br>
