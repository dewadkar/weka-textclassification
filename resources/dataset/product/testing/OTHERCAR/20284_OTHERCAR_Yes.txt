            I got a 94 sentra for the first time. Well we sold it in 97 and boy did I miss that car. We got another one in 98 and I am sooooo happy with it. It is great on gas and is really fun for me to drive. I got the stick shift and it is so fun. I can fit two car seats in the back and i have a lot of room in the front. I have yet to have any problems with my car. I will never ever trade this one in. I already told my husband that when we have more kids he will have to trade his car in for a minivan cause I am keeping my sentra.
