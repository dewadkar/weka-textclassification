                  This isn't good!  Cadillac has reached a new low.  The Deville is nice but this is absolutly terrible.  My neighbor bought this car and returned it a week later because she didn't like it.  Cadillacs are supposed to be a luxury car company.  The Catera is far, far from it.  The room in the front is terrible and the back is 10 times worse than a ferrari.  The trunk space isn't anything to brag about either.  In the commercials it says it drives like a BMW when the car is TRYING to be like a BMW.  The acceleration is bad and it is not fun to drive.  The one good thing about this is its stereo, it ain't half bad.  Remember if you are thinking about buying this, remember that it is NOT a Cadillac.  NOT a Cadillac!


Thanx
