            The Camaro SS or Z28 is one of the ebst sports cars out there. The Camaro Z28 has 305 HP but with the special SS hood, it's boosted up to 320 HP. This car is great for people who want to make modifications to it. However, it is not as good to drive it just like that with no mods. It is superfast and great on turns. The roar of the engine with a good exhaust is sometimes enough to turn on other cars' alarms (I know from experience). Although it's a great car, and a great chick magnet, it does get kind of pricy. The car itself is priced extremely low for what it could do, but the insurance price makes up for it. I would suggest getting license insurance for it. License insurance insures you no matter what car you drive, up to $15000 in damages. Overall, it is a very good car at a very good price and I would suggest buying one to anyone I know, or in this case, everyone!
