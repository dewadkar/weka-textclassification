            The Saturn SL2 is by far the best car I have owned (believe me, I have owned quite a few). First of all lets start off with family and safety features. It has child safety locks on the back doors along with reinforcing steel beams all around to prevent injuries. I personally like the airbag feature and electric seat belts. It's front wheel drive helps me to drive in the rainy Washington weather. I have also found it to be great driving in the snow. It is a relatively light car which helps with the great gas mileage it gets. 

I have had the car for four years and have only had to take it to the mechanic one time. This particular problem costs less than $200.00 to repair. Aside from that I am also happy with the way the paint has held up from the dry Southern California weather to the soggy Northwest weather. It is impressive to pop the hood and still see a very clean engine that I have never had to clean before. 

The stereo system is one of the better I have heard and I am surprised that I have not blown it up. 

Overall this car is dependable, roomy, stylish and very quick. I am a Saturn customer for life!<br><br>
