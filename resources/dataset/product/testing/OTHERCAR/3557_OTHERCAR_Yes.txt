            I purchased a brand new 2002 Chevy Malibu back in July of 2002.  Purchasing price was $19,760 plus I received a $3500 rebate.  In total $995 worth of options.  

The thing I noticed most about the new Malibu at the dealer was the interior inside the cars.  I couldn't believe how "busy" the seats were in almost every car.  In fact, I had the typical...."this is the car for you, pick a color" deal and I chose my actual color (bronzemist) based solely on the fact that it was the ONLY Malibu in the line with seats that were one solid color! 

I like the way Chevrolet is getting hip to vehicle safety, and warranty gaurantees. A 30,000 mile bumper to bumper, free towing anywhere, anytime, satelite chip, and best of all, if someone can steal your car.....Not only will Chevy give you a brand new car, but $3000 to go with it!  It's set up so that if the car is started without the key it will shut down. 

The safety features are good as well.  There are child locks on the rear doors that are VERY easy to snap on and off.  As soon as you put your car in drive or reverse, the doors automatically lock.  There are also power windows that you can lock out the rest of the car.  I have 3 small children who love to press the buttons and roll the windows down constantly, I LOVE the whole lock up the windows deal!  I also have dual frontal airbags, 4 wheel antilock brakes (which I hate but I'll get to that later), daytime running lamps with automatic lamp control, theater lighting, and height adjustable front and back seat belts.  

Let's talk engine!  I've got your basic 3.1 Liter V6 SFI 170 HP engine.  Comes with 4-spd automatic transmission w/ overdrive.  The car has sequential fuel injection, platinum tipped spark plugs, stainless steel exhaust, 4-wheel independant suspension, power rack & pinion steering, and is front wheel drive.

Now on to exterior.  I have "bolt on wheel covers" which must not be too great because my passenger side wheel cover constantly comes loose and it makes my car sound like it's falling apart old coming down a rocky road.  It comes standard with P215/60 R15 B/W touring tires, base coat/clear coat paint, 2 sided galvanized steel exterior panels.  Body color bumpers and door handles, mirrors, etc...  I've got reflector optics headlamps and dual breakaway mirrors.

I like the exterior, and apparantly so does the rest of the world because there are a million cars EXACTLY like mine!  

The gas mileage isn't great though for a smaller car.  I'm supposed to get 20 mpg in the city and 29 on the highway.  I don't know if I even get that though.  I get the best gas mileage using cruise control around 70 mph.  

Features that come standard....  Air conditioning (super important), tilt-wheel adjustable steering column, AM/FM stereo with CD player (stereo is the same as most home stereos, coming standard with auto tone for driving and stopping, and choosing a wide range of volumes for the music you specifically listen to), variable intermittent wipers, center shift console with armrest, storage, and 2 cupholders (one in the middle console and one on the drivers side beside the steering wheel (very convenient).  I've got reclining front bucket seats, auxiliary power outlets, and rear seat heat ducts.  

What I paid $995 for...I've got remote keyless entry that locks the doors, unlocks the doors, pops the trunk, and a panic horn.  You can make the horn chirp with settings but I can't figure out how to do it!  All settings are the lock switches and there are directions to how many clicks mean what and how long to hold down the buttons, etc.  Either mine doesn't work or it's not quite as simple as it sounds.
I've also got power windows, ISRV mirror w/map lights, OSRV power mirrors, and electronic cruise control.

Now I happen to know that the engine will cut off at 105 mph...I learned this because I like to race a little old man home at night after work and he drives a little 4 banger Hyndai and blows my doors off every night, which I just can't figure out!  

One problem that I have had was with my braking system.  About 15,000 miles in my brakes started grinding horribly.  They were almost useless in snow and rain.  I brought my car in for warranty work on them and was told this was "normal" for ABS systems and made out like I was out of my mind.  I was saved by one sole mechanic who listened to what I was telling him and checked one last time and realized that my car hadn't been checked at all!  There WAS a problem with my rear drivers side brake.  Apparently there was a bubble or something on my pad, the mechanic said that when the car was painted some may have possibly got into the brakes.  So I got new brakes.  Needless to say, if you don't think it's normal....fight for it!
