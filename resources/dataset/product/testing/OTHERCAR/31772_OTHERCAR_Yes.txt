            Our Brand New Sparkling 323i arrived on the 1st march 99, generally it has been a great car to drive a BIG improvement on the old 318 we had, it has great handling and very good accerlation not to mention the breaking, however the interior could do with some work. The new electronic temperature control leaves a lot to be desired if you have it set to a wacking 30 degrees it requires you to keep your finger on the button for ages to get it back down again, leaving you with a numb finger and less concentration for the road, BRING BACK THE DIALS. The other interior feature which is quite amusing at time is the placement of the cigarette lighter. Annoying isn't the word for it. My phone charger fits nicely unless the car is in 3rd or 5th and if anyone tries to remove the lighter while I'm changin gear they'd better watch I don't break some fingers in the process. Don't get me wrong, the cars great, but in this day and age you'd think we could have a Hot or cold switch for the heater.<br><br>
