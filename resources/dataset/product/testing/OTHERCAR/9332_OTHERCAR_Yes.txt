            I was looking for &quot;value for money&quot; in a digital camera, and found it in the Ricoh RDC-5000.

I first learned about the camera on the PC Magazine web site review (it was an &quot;Editor's Choice.&quot;)  It had all of the features I was looking for:  ease of use, high resolution capability, zoom, high quality lens, expandability and flexibility.

I've been using the RDC-5000 for a week, and am very impressed so far.  I've used the Kodak DC-210 at work and liked it, and am even more impressed with this Ricoh.  It is VERY easy to use, gives excellent photos with great color at all resolutions, and downloads to my both my home PC and notebook easily and quickly (it's fast through the serial port, it's really fast thru the USB).  The included software suite is excellent and versatile as well.  I like the fact Ricoh included the AC adapter -- I use it when downloading to the PC to save batteries.  I haven't yet seen any of the banding at low light levels warned about in the Epinion professional review.

If you have access to military base or post exchanges, you can get a good deal -- I bought it at the Kirtland AFB, NM BX for $649.<br><br>
