              The purchase of a Honda Passport presents a dilemma. The older model, like the '95 I own and base this review on, is a god-sent in the snow or in rough terrain. It handles like a car, with a decent turn radius, and it WOULD make a great family car if I had one. Therein lies the problem with Passports. I enjoy mine, but bought it for the wrong reasons. As a Californian college student, The Passport is more car, for more money, than I need it to be. DON'T buy a $18,000+ SUV unless you plan to use it off road or live in an area where climate makes 4WD a must. It gets low gas mileage (as most SUV's do) and accelerates slowly. additionally, the passport is prone to a large blind spot.
   Yet, owning a passport has it's benefits. A good warranty coupled with the reliability of Honda insures that your car either won't be in the shop, or cost you much if it is. Before buying it, make sure that the car doesn't &quot;pull&quot; in either direction. 4WD vehicles tend to do this, even if the alignment is only slightly off.
   On the whole, The Passport is a good buy. Shop around for the right price and make sure that the car fits your lifestyle. An educated decision will leave you pleased with your purchase.
