              I bought my 1992 Plymouth Sundance in 1998, after I was in a car accident. It's a two door hatchback, with enough room to sit five (sometimes six if someone's really skinny). This is a wonderful car for a student. It's small, compact, but big enough to fit semi-large items in the trunk. If you take out the barrier and put the back seat down, you can fit a futon in it (trust me, I've done it). This is wonderful if you have a large instrument or animals that are bigger than 20 pounds. The bad thing about this is what if you have a large instrument (i.e. cello) and two friends who need a ride? One of them is going to have to sit with the cello on the folded down back seat. That sucks for them. However,I get pretty good mileage on the highway, but in the city, it's not all that great. So far, I've had the car for over a year, and I've had to replace ALL of the belts, get two tires plugged, and take it to the dealership for a call back about the seats possibly lunging backward. Overall, I've only spent about $200 on a six year old car that now has 80,000 miles on it ( I've put 10,000 miles on it so far).
