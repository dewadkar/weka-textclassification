            Count me in! I agree with the other reviewers about this car.  It has great looks, and feels like a sports car without some of the harsh ride or feel.  We bought the car used in 1997 from a Toyota dealer lot.  My wife wanted a Celica, but I decided to compare it to the Mitsubishi Ellipse and the Acura Integra.  The Acura surprised me because it didn't have the comfort that I expected.  The used car lot dealer turned me off to the Ellipse right away.  He said they were inconsistent; some good some not.  He said go with the Acura or Celica.

Further down the road, we spotted a sea green (aqua) colored Celica in a lot, and it had everything we wanted.  It had the spoiler, sunroof, automatic trans., power windows, etc.  It also had the driver airbag.  Having shopped around for Celicas before, I knew the $12,000 price for a 50,000 mile car was not too far off.  Well, we took it for a spin in the middle of December, and immediately agreed it was what we wanted.  We drove it home.

Let me be frank with you.  This car had the Toyota brand, so I didn't feel like I had to look around anymore. I'm on my second Camry and I also had a '94 4Runner. This makes my 4th Toyota car.  Buy a Toyota and rest assured it is a reliable vehicle.  Say no more.

So far, we have 65,000 miles and I replaced the timing belt at around 60,000.  I did that for assurance and not because the car needed anything. For Toyota's, I usually change the oil every 3,000 miles and that's about all they need.

Summary:  the car looks super! it handles very well, it isn't too noisy and it is reliable.
