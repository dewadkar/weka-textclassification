            I have had my 900SE 5-door manual for two years, and I love it. It was my first new car, purchased over the Honda Accord 2-door V-6. I have have had a few problems with the car, but it has all been covered by the warranty.

There are a few pointers I would mention to those looking into this model.

First, this model has been known to have air conditioning problems, according to the dealer and my experience. The valves on the system can lead to intense vibrations felt through the pedals. I had this problem, and eventually it led to failure of the compressor bearings. Of course this was all covered by the warranty, and my dealer (International Motors in Falls Church) is one of the best at fixing problems. If the car is coming off warranty, try to get the extended warranty. It's a great deal for the expensive nature of these problems with the Saab.

Second, with the SE models, take a good look at the tires. The SE tires a can be extremely expensive. I also recommend the road hazard tire insurance which is included in the extended insurance I purchased, but was not standard in the manufacturer's warranty. I took two nails through the tires in irreparable places in the first six months and would have appreciated the coverage.

Third, though the manual says the car is capable of handling 87 octane fuel, note that the manual also recommends using 91 octane. I recently switched to 91 octane and have noticed an increase in performance of the turbo. With the recent gasoline prices, this has become fairly expensive.

Fourth, the car is large enough to seat three adults, but four for longer hauls is impractical. BUT, it is much larger than the Audi A4, and the hatchback leaves lots of space for transporting bikes, boxes and others.

Fifth, there are the little things: not enough drink holders, not enough force in the rear windshield washer (the pump is in the front), the sub woofer in the door &quot;woofs&quot; and vibrates the rear view mirrors, making it difficult to see behind you, no armrest in the middle of the front seat. 

Those are the &quot;bad&quot; things. The good things on this car are innumerable. I am continually amazed by the engineering design and detail put into this car - take the automatic climate control system. It is wonderful at defrosting, defogging, heating, cooling, and the little sun sensor in the windshield automatically increases the fan speed when it is in direct sunlight! I find myself driving entirely too fast on smooth roads as a result of the turbo and the handling capabilities of this car. It is great, comfortable, and still has that new car smell after two years. I am so happy with this car that I am currently considering the 9-3 Viggen convertible and the 9-5 Aero. Overall, I am a Saab convert.
