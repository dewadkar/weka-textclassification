            After 8 months of internet research,national classified perusal,and in person shopping, I bought a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Country in January of 2000.  I looked at other SUV's during the initial stages of my search,and decided it had to be a JEEP. I'm 47 yrs. old and don't plan on buying another car every 3 yrs. I wanted something durable,reliable and pleasing to the eye. The engine manufacture of the JEEP is historically long-lived. Originally made for general purpose (thus the name JEEP-GP),it can handle on or off road driving,and do so with confidence. I looked at average mileage and resale values and was impressed with how many Jeeps are still on the road with 200,000 plus miles and how well they continue to perform.It is NOT a luxury car. You do not have the sense of smoothness and comfort that you get from a Nissan Pathfinder,for example. You feel the road beneath you and you know you are DRIVING the car--not just riding in it.
I chose a 96 because I wanted as &quot;near new&quot; as my dollars would allow without going to a different model or edition. I find the design changes on the Grand Cherokees less true to the original appeal and recognition factor.
I do more city driving than highway,and am averaging about 17 MPG so far. But, I wanted to make sure that I was buying something I could drive cross country without becoming bankrupt on gas. Estimates suggest between 21-24 MPG on long distance hauls which is acceptable to me. I do a lot of flea market-type shopping and always have my dog with me,so the roominess and drop down back seat are a major plus for my spur of the moment,odd sized purchases.
I bought the Country &quot;package&quot; as it is called:AC,AT,4 door,2WD,AMFM CASS,4.0 Litre Eng,roof rack,alloy wheels,cloth seats.
With 42,000 miles on it, I came home amazed that my offer of $13,835 (out the door) was accepted,without counter, from the asking price of $14,995 plus tax,inventory,etc. The dealer was impressed with the degree of research I'd done and the deal itself was a dream. I'm happy.
