            This camera is just incredible.  I have used it to post various items laying around the house on Ebay (old concert tee's , books old mags, old SLR parts, jewelry) and in 3 weeks it has paid for itself. I spent $399.00 plus accessories (extra rechargeable batteries and a 128 mb chip). 
The the biggest surprise was that the battery life is excellent!  I bought rechargeables (2 sets~ one for backup) and to my delight one set lasts several hours. My old camera sucked them up in less than 20 frames with a flash.
With the 3800 i can usually take at least 40-60  with flash 200 plus w/o. With the power saver option it will shut the camera down after 30 or 60 seconds of non use. This pushes battery life way up. 
The camera is really lite, and i am amazed how sturdy it is. Shipping costs on these things has to be next to nil.

I bought an extra memory chip...a 128 mb. It holds 200  pix on the highest resolution 3.0 m, and 930 on the lowest resolution of .03m. AMAZING!  So for easy fast Ebay listings this is perfect.  The 16 mb chip that the camera comes with is kind of a joke, and obviously they throw that in because they know you will need to buy a bigger chip if you want to take the camera anywhere that you will want to shoot more than a "roll". That's fine with me because to hold over 200 fine pictures on a chip the size of a nickel in one camera is really awesome. 
Without a tripod it is really difficult to get a clear shot when the zoom is maxed, because the trigger is a little slow.  The sound it makes (ka-click-cha) is really funny, because as there are no moving parts it feigns an SLR!
There is not much warning before the battery goes out. That is one feature i dont like. The flash is good, strong and adjustable with 4 different settings. The f stop has 4 settings auto, 8.2,4.8, and 2.8.  Sharpness settings: hard normal and soft.Self timer is a nice feature too.
No complaints really. I have even used it to sell off my SLR gear and parts. Goodbye SLR, hello DIGITAL!
