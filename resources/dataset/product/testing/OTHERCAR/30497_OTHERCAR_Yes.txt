            When I say Fast, I'm not kidding.  This little VW is QUICK.  You generally don't think of a Beetle as a hotrod but this Beetle is quick.  This Beetle is a whole different animal that the Beetle of 60's and 70's.  Those Beetles had about 40 horsepower and a four speed manual.  The Turbo S had a 20 valve, turbocharged 180 horsepower four cylinder with a six-speed manual transmission and 17" low-profile tires.

I don't know what 0-60 time is but my daughter has a 3.2 CL type S Acura and this little Beetle will give her all she wants and will catch second and third gear rubber.  It corners like it is on rails and there is definitely no problem merging into the freeway traffic, except watching that you don't run over who is in front of you.  Mine runs 75 at just a few revs under 3000 RPM and it redlines at 6500 RPM so figure it should use most of the 160 mph speedometer.  I know mine will never know while I own it.

There are really not any options on the Turbo S other than color and interior color.  It comes with all the bells and whistles.  It has power windows, power door locks, remote keyless entry, remote trunk unlock, sunroof, ESP system, lumbar adjustment on the sports seats, heated leather sports seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather gear shift knob.  It is a NICE car.  I love mine.

As far as handling goes, with the ESP and the 17" low profile Michelin tires, plus the low center of gravity, it corners really nice and the leather bucket sports seats keep you right there where you are in complete control.  Steering is very quick and positive.  It is a blast to drive and I find it a lot more comfortable on a long drive than most any other car I have ever driven.  The leather is soft and very pliable and not hard like some of the much more expensive sports cars..

If you do need to stop quickly, the 4 wheel disc brakes and 4 wheel ABS do a great job of putting the whoa on thing quickly and straightly.  I haven't had to make a panic stop but I have been very impressed with the quality and assuredness of the braking on my Beetle Turbo S.  I would say that the ability to go and ability to stop are both way above average.

The Beetle Turbo S has a lot more room in it than you would think.  It is a lot easier for me to get in and out of my Beetle than it is to get in and out of my wife's Jetta.  Even the back seat is endurable for a medium sized adult.

The Turbo S has the 220 watt Monsoon stereo system with eight speakers, a cassette and all the hookups for the trunk mounted 6 CD changer which mine has. All the controls for the stereo and the climate control are readily accessible and easy to read and understand.  The instrument panel could be a little bigger but is adequate and easy to see.  The stereo sounds real good and I can't imagine needing anymore.

The fit and finish on the Beetle are very good and the paint seems very deep and lustrous.  I was very impressed with the quality of the car when I rolled my other Beetle and was not hurt and the car stood up really well.

As far as mileage goes, EPA rates it 23 city and 30 highway but I have been getting almost a 26 mpg average in town and about 32.5 on the road.  I don't use all 180 horses very often though.
