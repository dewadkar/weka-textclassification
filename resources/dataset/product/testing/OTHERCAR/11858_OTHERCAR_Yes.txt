            Purchased my 02 EX 4 door automatic about 10 months ago from today to replace my aging 97 Nissan Altima.
I was very impressed my 97 Honda civic and was pretty set on a new Civic as my next purchase even though i did shop around before sealing the deal.
During this 10 month period i have used my car to deliver pizzas 9 hours a day on some of the worse roads i have ever driven in my 25 year old life.
23,000 miles into my relationship with this vehicle I have pushed it to the very limit of its abilities on the daily basis and given it a beating worthy of a case study by Honda to measure the effect of abusive driving on their products.  
I will explain what i put the vehicle through in detail on the daily basis and i will then say what has failed or developed as a result from said driving.

On the daily basis my vehicle endures-

- 30 short high speed drives less than 20 minutes in length in a stop and go situation.
- Driver side door opens and closes over 100 times in a 24 hour period.
- Driver and passenger side windows opened and closed over 80 times in a 24 hour period.
- Vehicle accelerated from stop to 40 mph over 200 times in a 24 hour period.  
- Vehicle driven at high speeds on horrible roads that i can only describe as the Brooklyn Queens expressway.You have to live in Norfolk VA to fully appreciate the street conditions here.

As a result of this abuse the following problems have appeared-

-Driver side window flutters as it rises sometimes.(probably a loose window rail as i suffered this problem on my 97 civic also. Easily repaired)
-Loud clang from driver side drive train occasionally when shifting from P to D.(Probably a bushing missing)
-A squeak from rear passenger side wheel. ( actually this went away last week)

Some design improvements i would like to see-

- Passenger seat makes my left leg fall asleep on long rides on the road. Not nearly as comfortable as the driver seat.
- Make it handle like my 97 Civic HX did.
- Remove carpeting from floor and use the rubber like in the Honda Element.
-Increase the size of the sunroof
-Use some quality paint. I have never seen a car scratch as easily as my new civic and this is the biggest turn off for me in reference to this vehicle.

I hope my review of this vehicle will help you in your search for information on this vehicle.
It has served me well so far and i believe it will continue to do so for a long time to come.
