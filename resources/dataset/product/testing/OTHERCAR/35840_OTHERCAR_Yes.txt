            I bought my 1996 Saturn used.  I got it at the local dealership, where they were very friendly and helpful.  When I needed new front brakes at my 3rd oil change, they did them for 1/2 price.  

It's a very comfortable low-maintenance city car. It would not be quite as good on long drives, especially for larger individuals.  It's really built well for women, though.  I'm 5'3&quot; and have no trouble at all.   I've put 40,000 miles on it in Wisconsin weather and it has handled beautifully in terrible conditions.  Also, Saturns don't tend to rust because of the plastic panels.  

I don't like the wind noise.  The weatherstripping along the doorframe pulls away from the corners and air whistles through the gap.  Honestly, though, I can't find any major problems.  <br><br>
