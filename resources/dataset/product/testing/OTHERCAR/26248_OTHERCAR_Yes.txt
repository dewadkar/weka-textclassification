            I think that if you are going to start your child off with a first car, or if you yourself are out to buy your first car, then this is the one I would recommend most.  This Honda Civic is certainly the most reliable car I have ever dealt with.  What makes it so great for a person who is just beginning to drive, or somebody who needs to remain thrifty, is that this is a very economical car.  Since it usually gets 35-40 miles per gallon, that means you won't have to spend all your savings on gas, which is really good in this time of high gas prices, and as long as you continue to take car of it, and tend to the monthly/annually tune-ups, then it should last a long time, without much being spent on mechanics, and other such places.  

Also, beings as though it is very easy to keep the car in good shape, that means when it comes time to buy another car, or re-sell this car to somebody else, you will get a higher resale value, since it is still running very well.

As for the features/designs, depending on what accessories you add, it is a very roomy car for the money, with other accessories added without a huge price increase.  So you can go from basic, floor display car, to &quot;impress your friends with your toys,&quot; kind of car, with little extra cost.<br><br>
