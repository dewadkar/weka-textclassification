            My brother recently purchased a used 1995 Corvette Grand Sport with low miles  (26,000).  Fortunate for me, (not him) he recently had foot surgery and cannot drive for several weeks.....so I took this opportunity to &quot;test drive&quot; his car to work quite a few times.

The grand sport package definitely turns heads.  The electric blue color with white racing stripes scream &quot;look at me&quot;.  The performance of the car is very good, but the driveability of the car is not as good as some other sports cars of the same caliber (mostly Japanese sports cars).

The car accelerates very quickly from a stop, but acceleration from about 60 miles an hour was not impressive.  The handling was first class.  Pardon the lame expression, but the car really does handle like it is riding on rails.  With fantastic handling usually comes a tradeoff.....this car is no exception.  The ride quality is horrible.  But remember, this is something that should be expected in a sports car. The car is very brutal on less than perfect roads.  However, the ride is very compliant on extremely smooth roads, but in this region of the country, there aren't many of those.  The car squeaks and rattles constantly, but you may not hear the squeaks over the extremely loud exhaust noise in the cabin.  

The car is definitely feature-laden.   Auto climate control, digital dash, cruise control, power driver and passenger seats, just to name a few.  

This is not the type of car that most people would enjoy driving to work everyday.  It takes more concentration to drive, it's loud, and the ride is punishing.  This car is much better suited to being a 2nd or 3rd car that is used just for fun than a daily driver.   

For the price, the car was probably a good buy, however, If you're in the market for a used Corvette, I would recommend purchasing the 1997 and up model.  The improvements in driveability and structural stiffness in the newer Corvette could make the car a much easier car to live with on a daily basis.  <br><br>
