            I was cautious about buying this car because of it's low price. I was afraid that meant low quality. I've been surprised at how reliable my 1995 Neon has been. It's still getting good mileage, and the only thing I've had to do outside regular maintenance is change the battery. 

For the most part, I really like this car, but I admit it's a little smaller than I'd like. The driver's seat is VERY close to the steering wheel, which made it difficult for me to get in and out when I was pregnant. The back seat is narrower than I'd like--it's difficult to accommodate two adults with a child seat installed in the middle.

The seats have been incredibly resilient, though. Over the years, I've spilled soft drinks and transported dogs and kids, and the seats don't show much wear at all. If only I could get that new car smell back!<br><br>
