            I bought this product a few weeks ago.  I have wanted a digital camera for months now but I wasn't sure what was the best value for my money.  The DC-200 is very easy to use.  It also has a lot of features for being so simple.  I wanted something to start off with so I could get the feel of how most digital cameras work. I can't even think of one thing wrong with this camera.  One thing is the size, but even that seems like a small thing to worry about.  The Mavica is bigger, despite having a simple digital to computer transfer (using a floppy disk).  The DC-200 requires a  serial transfer (a wire connects your camera to your computer so you can transfer the pictures). This may be a pain but I didn't find it too difficult at all.
I may upgrade within the next year but for now, this camera covers most of my needs.  I am designing websites and don't want to take pictures off the web. Taking my own pictures has been a lot of fun.  
If you want ease and the most bang for your buck, go for the DC-200.  It's definitely worth every penny.<br><br>
