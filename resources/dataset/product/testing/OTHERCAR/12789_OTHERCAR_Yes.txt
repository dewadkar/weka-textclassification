            The S20 with a whopping 3.3 megapixels of resolution offers the highest resolution per dollar than most other digital cameras. The rear 1.8-inch LCD screen gives a through-the-lens look at your subject, and also doubles as the menu interface. The camera can be easy to use as �point and shoot�, but there are also plenty of programmable options.

Features include centre-weighted (or spotlight) metering, which takes into account the light conditions of your subject compared with it�s surrounding. Images were sharp and very detailed, but the camera adjusted to the lighting conditions perfectly. It accepts both type-I and the new type-II IBM Microdrive Compact Flash memory cards. It comes with an 8Mb card, which can hold between 3 and 15 images at the maximum 2048 x 1536 resolution, depending on the amount of JPEG compression you choose (super fine, fine or normal). 

A 2x-Optical zoom and a 4x-Digital zoom are available. The camera connects to your PC via either the serial or USB port. The only problem I found was the tiny, plastic connector at the camera end, which looked as if it could break easily. The s20 comes with heaps of software � including Adobe�s Photo Deluxe and a cute tool called PhotoStitch, which allows you to �glue� images together digitally to create panoramic views. Built-in power saving options help stretch battery life. 

Overall the S20 is one of the best cameras on the market.
