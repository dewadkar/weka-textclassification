            This review is based on the V-12 equipped 850i.  

Some history first:  The 8-series began its life in '89, when the first model year 1990 was available to the public in Europe.  In '91 it was brought to the USA.  The 850i back then (up until 1995) was a 5.0L V12 outputting 300 horsepower.  My review is based on these early 90s models.

Exterior:  This is a design that grows on you so well over time.  It's an extremely classy design with brilliant execution and will age like wine with time.  The back tail light treatment is the best, and the front really looks like a shark.  Very nice.  As usual, offered with vibrant and attractive colors as with other BMWs.

Interior:  As usual for German cars of late, the car's interior looks virtually the same in the year 2000 car (still offered in Europe and elsewhere) as it did in 1990.  Very, VERY business-like environment, with great-looking seats (like the Mercedes SL-class, I love how the seatbelt system is fully integrated into the seats).  Rear space is bad, like in other 2 door GTs.  Good visibility, and lately, has been dressed up with the usual high quality wood as in late model BMWs.  Fit and finish is typical as well, of course (hey, this is like the flagship of BMW GTs for the last decade)

Engineering:  Wow.  Ever since the very beginning, this car was very advanced.  Actually had airbags in the '90 models.  ABS.  Fully-featured computer information center in the cockpit, I think they have (had?) 2 fuel tanks and 2 batteries!  The mid-late 90s 850 models, now with the 5.4L 326HP V-12s (awesome, awesome engine) have become so sophisticated that the price difference between it and its lesser bretheren (the 840i with 4.4L V8, same engine as in 740 and 540) is about $22,000.  Yes a couple of thousand of that is for the engine swap, but mostly the chassis electronics.  Electronically damped suspension, amongst others, were pretty much available in the 8-series before any other cars.  BMW's technological tour-de-force, that 8-series.  For sure, crash-test performance is world-class, even as far back as '89.

Ride and Drive:  This car (850 especially) is HEAVY.  4200+ lbs.  But they have incredible engines, that eat away those highway miles so quickly it's almost unreal.  Supremely comfortable as a long-distance cruiser, the 850i is very solid in feel, and very refined.  Handling suffers due to the weight, but it easily exhibits that hunkered-down, in-control-of-the-road feel as with all BMWs.  The electronic suspension is said to work pretty well, although many I'm sure have opted against it, if for anything, solely on price (if you have it on your car, a shock absorber costs over $750, but the standard shocks cost about $150 each!).  The computer gives the driver any and all info he/she could possibly want.  Throughout the years, BMW has improved their manual as well as auto transmissions.  Even a '90 model car, with the 5.0L V-12 and 4-spd auto, accelerates like a TRAIN as it picks up speed.  You don't know what linear torque delivery means until you get behind the wheel of a German large displacement engine.  And believe me, this V-12 (naturally) is supremely smooth (even more so the newer 5.4L, that thing is electric in its power delivery).  Very impressive.  Those with automatics all are equipped with sport buttons, which when engaged, alter the shift points, steering feel, and, as of late, the suspension even.  Being in sports mode and letting her rip above 100mph gives you a downshifting surge ahead that will scare most of your passengers!  Even though it all feels controlled and hefty (that weight undoubtedly adds to the stable feel on the highway).  And the early 90s models for sure had traction control, but it's not nearly as good as BMWs newest ASC+T offering, which is simply superb, even in snow.  Offered starting in 1996 I think, was the M-powered 850CSi.  This car was even heavier, but check this:  380HP V-12, 6-speed tranny, sportier suspension, larger wheels and tires.  This was an amazing autobahn smasher that could get to 300kph no problem.  What else can you say but 'wow'!  Then again you would say that about the price.

Reliability:  There's so much electronics that things are bound to go wrong.  Especially the early 90s 8-series.  BMW by then hasn't been the best at electronics reliability (though lately they've become lightyears better).  So be careful of that, as it could get expensive.  Always keep an eye/ear/whatever on everything, and service the beautiful beast with diligence.  I wouldn't worry too much if you own a '97+ car though, except if something does happen and you're outta warranty it could be expensive, but then again if money was very tight you wouldn't own an 840 or 850 right?  :)

Overall, not a very popular car (the SL-class from Benz has been much more sucessful sales wise).  Perhaps the car came in at a bad time, perhaps not.  Perhaps many thought of it as too heavy, why bother when you can get cheaper and more fun things to drive like the 3-series (M power especially) and the 5 series?  Perhaps the styling wasn't that sexy for many.  Regardless, a misunderstood car.  A GT can only be appreciated, really, by the owner and driver.  That means, it's very hard to gain appeal over you unless you have already bought one.
