            I was recently helping my bestfriend buy a car and we happen to come across the Subaru 2.5 RS. This is one great piece of machine. Eventhough he changed his mind about purchasing this car, I still feel that he passed up on a great car. I have to admit that this has to be one of Subaru's best work. After test driving this car I wished I could have driven it home. Living in Minnesota, I was overly impressed with the AWD(all wheel drive) option. THe bad winters ahead of us in MN, this option would come in great on those snowy/icy days. I was not only impress by the AWD option but the looks of the car was very attractive. The options that this car have is phenomenal. The Impreza has a nice low spoiler giving it a sporty look. In the front of the car, it also comes with two nicely placed fog lights to help it during foggy weathers. The body of the car is so nicely crafted, you would mistaken it for a piece of Donatello's art. The Interior of the car is beautiful. The Whole interior is leather from head to toe. The seats are a snugged fit to the driver and comfortable for the whole ride. The back is rooming and have plenty of room for the kids. The car also comes with a cd/radio player with speakers sound that will blow your mind away. This 165hp car is one piece of work to be reckon with. 

This car fits in a class bby itself. All the features thats this car offers, you wil ever get tire of playing with all of its gadgets. At the price that it is being sell for, its a steal. 

This car is great for the working person of the world. The Impreza looks great and handles great. There is so much room in the back two average person will fit comfortably for the ride. This car will not only make you feel younger and richer and you stroll around in the streets, it will give a new attitude about driving. This is a great car to head into the new millenium.<br><br>
