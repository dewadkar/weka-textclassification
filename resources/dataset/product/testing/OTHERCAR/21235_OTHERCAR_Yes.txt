            All I can really say about this car is &quot;Wow!&quot; This is one of the best cars that Toyota has ever produced for the mass market. The 2000 Camry has so many nice features. Not only is the ride smooth at whatever speed you want to go (max of 140mph) but it is just so comfortable inside. It's like driving the most comfortable couch in the house.In addition, for the great reliability and handling the Camry provides, it can be bought a very reasonable price of around 21K depending what features you wish to add. The many features include leather seating, tinted windows, cassette tape/CD player, and more.<br>The sound system is also something to take into consideration. No matter what kind of music you're into, the Camry can make you feel like you're a part of the music. The sound is crisp and clear, and even while driving down the freeway at high speeds and among heavy traffic, the sound system barely loses a beat.<br>The new 2000 Toyota Camry is one of the best family cars out on the market right now, so if you want a car that gives you practically everything, and I emphasize everything, like great handling, a smooth ride, great sound system, along with all the other comforts and conveniences, then the 2000 Camry is a very good choice.<br><br><br>
