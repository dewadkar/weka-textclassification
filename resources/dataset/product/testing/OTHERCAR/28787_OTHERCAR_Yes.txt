            Well, after hitting a deer with my 1987 Plymouth Sundance and selling that car to my friends autobody shop, which they fixed up and sold to another person, I needed a new car. I knew after my Sundance experience I wanted my next car to be an import. I decided that because imports are always better or even more reliable than any American cars.

So I went looking and it turned out a friend of mine's daughter was selling her VW Fox because she got married. So naturally I decided I might as well check it out...I liked driving a friends 2000 Jetta  and fell in love with her 1987 VW car right away, even though I did not like the looks of it. 

Well since buying it, I have had virtually no trouble what so ever. In fact in this past year I have placed about 30000 KM on the car without anything major go on the car. When I bought the car in 1999 it had 168000 KM on it...I now have over 214000 KM on it. The only major thing I have had to do this year was replace the alternator and the battery but other than that, it has held up quite well. The parts are quite easy to get and the work done on the vehicle has been excellent.

I absolutely love being able to get about 550 KM on a tank of gas. And when the gas prices went sky high earlier this year, I had no worries about having to break the bank to fill up my car. (No SUV fuel costs here) :) I have enjoyed driving this car lots too. 

Performance is adequate too..You won't get any speeding tickets driving this car or win any drag races, but if you want a solid running vehicle with low maintanance costs look at a VW Fox.

Did I also mention that I have lots of storage room too? Well the wagon has outstanding room for carrying lots of stuff and the seats fold down too. It is also quite unique being a 2 Door station wagon

The only down side of the car is that it is not a very pretty car. Being a guy, I like good looking cars. The car also needs some more options...but that was never VW's intent when they brought out the Fox.

All in all though, you can't go wrong driving one of these cars. It has been a great second vehicle for me...The only thing is now I really want to have a brand new car. The Fox still has lots of life in it. And my friend wants to buy it from me. So I guess we'll see what happens!
