            You get a lot for your money with this car.  The packaging is practical and in general very competitive with Hondas and other mid-size sedans.  I had this car for two weeks as a rental car and grew to like it.  It is much improved over poor-handling low-performance cars GM and Ford have been stamping out over the last 20 years.  

I had the base 4-door, 4-cylinder, automatic.  I found its acceleration very adequate and in general its handling manners were quite good.  The breaks seemed right too without the typical over-assist present in others.  Later, I was surprised to find the cost for this car is in the $15's.  They also have been featuring a $1,000 rebate!  

Mechanically, this car's chassis is the same as the Pontiac Grand Am or Olds Alero.  I crawled underneath and was impressed with the four-wheel fully-independent suspension nicely implemented.  

One feature I missed was a fold-down rear seat, but I found you can have on with the upgraded interior option.

Again, this is an A-ok vehicle.<br><br>
