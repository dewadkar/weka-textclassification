            What's more to ask about the qx4? You have it all, power, luxury, performance and an affordable price. This car around 34 grand is amazing. The smooth ride, is crisp and quiet, and what else do you expect made by the great company of Nissan in Japan. The cd player and speaker system sums it all up when you pop in a nice, brisk cd. The roomy seats in the back are comfertable as well as lush! This car really does have it all. It performs really well in the snow and sleet, thats possibly the reason I've bought it. Heck, one day I slept in the backseats! I take this car where ever I go, and it's such a looker. People turn green of envy by looking at this car! at 34 grand, you can't go wrong, especially becuase a mercedes or Lexus is around 40-50 thousand as well. This is a great car, buy it!<br><br>
