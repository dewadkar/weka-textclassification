             Unless you've spent the last few years living on a deserted island with Gilligan and the Skipper, you've probably heard that GM has given Oldsmobile its walking papers. And after the 2004 model year, Olds is gone just like Plymouth was a few years back. 
  Where did Olds go wrong? The first Olds I was ever in was my friend's mom's '70 Cutlass convertible. It was red, had a V8 and was so cool! But like many American car divisions, Oldsmobile has lost its direction. Its cars were too much like other cars in GM divisions and the modern folks that we are realize this. Sure Olds sold the Aurora, which was revolutionary back in 1995, but not so much anymore, now sharing a basic platform with the Buick Lesabre and Pontiac Bonneville.   The midsize Alero is the last car to where an Olds badge. The Bravada SUV also continues for a bit. I rented an Alero in Colorado recently so here is my take on the last car of one of the oldest car brands in the world.

Powertrain: C
  If you listen to GM's new car czar Bob Lutz, he'll have you believing that the new 2.2 liter 140 horsepower Ecotec four cylinder is the best four cylinder on the market. And yes it is a much better engine than the old and ancient Quad four it replaces. But in terms of power deliver and smoothness its still very much lacking. When I drove out of the Avis lot, my first thought was that the Ecotec engine sounded like an '84 Honda Accord with a head cold! The engine whines and growls and could probably use a dose of Sudafed to calm it's symptoms. The optional 170 horsepower 3.4 liter V6 is probably a better choice.
    More alarming was the lack of power. Granted I was in Denver, "The mile High City", and altitude does affect power but the Ecotec simply had no grunt at all. It was not unusual to have to downshift into second on the highway just to pass. I've not had to do that in any car since my 78 horsepower '87 Toyota Tercel! And up in the mountains, the Alero struggled to get up to even normal cruising speed. 
   The automatic transmission however was very good. It offered smooth shifting and quick downshifting, which is important because you sure will need it. Automatic transmissions seem to be a General Motors specialty since every GM car I've driven has a great auto tranny.
   Fuel economy was around 25 MPG which isn't great for a four cylinder but the altitude probably did play a part here too.

Handling/steering/brakes/ride: D+
  While I'm not sure why, I always thought of the Alero as somewhat of a sports sedan. Maybe it was because it shares a platform and chassis with the sporty looking Pontiac Grand Am. Or maybe I bought into the idea that Oldsmobile was GM's "European Style" division. But in reality, the Alero is far from sporty.
   While the Alero does have a four wheel independent suspension system is was very obvious to me the GM tuned it more for comfort than for good handling, The Alero exhibits a lot of body lean and generally feels very unsettled in even smaller turns. 
    This feeling is not helped by a steering system the lacks any sort of feedback, It is on the firm side but this firmness is fake feeling and vague. Now the ride quality was quite good but other cars such as the Honda Accord, Mazda 6 and Nissan Maxima also ride well but the handling on those cars does not suffer, especially the ultra fun Mazda. 
    Basically the Alero's handling falls somewhere in between the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Toyota Camry, not as floaty as the Mercury but not as responsive as the Camry. And might I add the Camry is no handler! As far as brakes, the Alero does a decent job although I would like to see less nosedive and a firmer pedal feel.

Interior: C-
  I have to wonder what GM was going for here. The Alero has a more Japanese layout than many American cars. The wiper stalk is to the right of the steering wheel, the turn signal stalk is to the left and incorporates the headlights just like in any Honda or Nissan. So how came every time I turn on the car do I hit the wiper stalk? Well the ignition switch is on the dash rather than the steering column. But the Toyota Camry has this same layout and I've never done that in there. 
    In typical GM fashion, the entire interior is finished in a shiny cheap gray plastic with varying shades of gray. It appears to be no better than the GM cars from the '80s in this respect. The controls are well laid out for the most part. The ventilation controls are easy to use and the air conditioning works VERY well. 
   The Alero is a few inches smaller than the Honda Accord and about the same size as the Mazda 6 so it's a decently sized car. The funny thing is that I found the front legroom to be lacking. The Alero could use at least another inch of room to make a tall guy like me comfortable. The Accord and Mazda 6 have plenty of room up front. The same goes for the rear seat. The Alero seems to have the rear seat room closer to that of a Honda Civic than an Accord! At least they fold down 60/40 to expand what is an already nice sized trunk.
  And then there are the seats themselves. They felt flimsy and not very supportive. My back started to hurt after about 30 minutes, and I don't have a bad back. Visibility is good all around.
  As for build quality, the Alero had quite a few squeaks and rattles after only 15,000 miles. My 1993 Nissan Maxima with almost 100,000 miles has none!

Exterior: B
  The Alero has always been one of GM's better-looking sedans, the coupe less so. It started with the 1998 Olds Intrigue which offered an import look that no GM sedan had ever had before. This theme continued in the Alero. 
    The look is clean and contemporary if a bit dull. There is no cheesy plastic body cladding of any kind. The overall effect is somewhat sporty and lean. Newer car designs are more chiseled and aggressive though and the Alero is starting to look dated, but overall it's a good effort from GM.

Overall: C-/D+
  It's really a shame that Oldsmobile can't go out with a bang. The Alero leaves me cold. The engine is noisy and underpowered, the handling is abysmal and the interior is not very comfortable. And to add to this, the Olds brand will gone soon and it won't help resale value. 
   However this car really defines old school GM rather than Oldsmobile specifically. If the powers that be had really put there all into Oldsmobile we could have had a mid-priced American car brand that really delivered on the promise of performance and style. It seems GM is doing this but with the much more expensive Cadillac instead. So the very last car from Oldsmobile is a dud from a division that once gave us the way cool Cutlass convertible. How sad.
