            When my parents first bought the car in 88 or 89, they picked it out because of the price and because of the reputation Toyota has for making long lasting vehicles.  So far the car has survived my mother and myself and is currently getting my sister from point a to point b.  
The gas mileage has dropped off in the past few years, but is still going a long way without refueling.  The trunk is large for a car it's size, large enough to fit luggage for four people for a week long trip with little hassle.
However, the Corolla has a severe lack of power, and it is tough to get it up to it's top speed of about 80.  The brakes are slow to respond.  After driving my Nissan Altima, the Corolla is very awkward.  
I recommend the Toyota Corolla to high school and college students and small families on a budget. <br><br>
