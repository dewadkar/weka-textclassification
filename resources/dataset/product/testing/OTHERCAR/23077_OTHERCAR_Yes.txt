            I like my PDC 640 and enjoy the ease of use that it supports. I have not had any problems as I have heard with the use of this product.Basically, it has the point and shoot type of features that I need as a amateur,family photo nut.My wife loves to go out and take pictures of nature,kids and anything else that comes along.We enjoy the delete feature that you can use if you don't like the picture on the spot leaving space for more pictures.The price is about right for this type of camera.The extra added feature of hooking it up to your TV is fun for the kids and useful in editing your pictures.

NOW,For the software it could be a little more user friendly.I have a few other picture editing software programs that work well with the pictures I take with my camera so I don't use this software much.There is always  better software out on the market so you will have to judge this one for yourself.<br><br>
