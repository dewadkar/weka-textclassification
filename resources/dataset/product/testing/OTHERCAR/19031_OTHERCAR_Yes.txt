            This is a good camera. But it may not suit for everyone.

It renders great pictures. Color is always right, never need to be fixed
by software.

But its protruding lens is extremely fragile. It can be easily damaged
by sands or dirts in the wind. Mine was broken in 2 weeks. I brought it to
beach a couple of time. I never dropped it in the sands. It was damaged
by the inevitable sands in the air.

It has a lot of manual controls, which may not be needed by regular
people. So my advice for regular people is to buy D-490Z, which is
cheaper, less fragile, less manual, and the same picture quality.

Here is my story of buying my digital camera.

My first digicam is an Olympus 2020Z. Its picture quality is great. But
in a few weeks, the protruding lens stopped working. So I returned it.
But my digital photography experience was so good that I have to buy
another digital camera. This time, afraid of fragile lens problems, I
bought a zoom-less Epson photoPC 800. Its picture color was so bad that
I do not even want this camera for a tenth of its price.  So I returned
it also. Now what should I do? I still want a digital camera. I looked
Nikon models (800 &amp; 950). Nikon's zooming lens is covered, so it will be
robust. But based on the sample pictures on the web and messages in the
news group, I noticed Nikon also has some color problem. In-door
pictures tend to be cold and white. People also talk about purple cast,
and red eye problems. So I did not go ahead with Nikon. Then one day I
went to a local shop, I saw Olympus D-490Z. It is like a compact and
less manual version of 2020Z. I knew its picture quality must be
comparable to 2020Z. Its lens is less fragile, since the moving parts
are hidden in a barrel, although the barrel is moving. So I believe
D-490Z should give me the good picture quality of 2020Z without 2020Z's
fragile lens. I bought D-490Z. It is just as I expected. I got great
pictures in all situation in full auto mode -- in door or out door,
cloudy or shining, with or without flash. It has some White Balance
settings for different in door light conditions and out door weather
conditions. But I never used them. The auto mode is just good enough. I
also noticed this camera performs extremely well in low light without
flash -- the pictures are just like what you see in the real scene.
