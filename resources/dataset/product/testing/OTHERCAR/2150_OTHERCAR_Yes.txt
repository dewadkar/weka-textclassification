            I purchased my GTI 1.8T a little over a year ago and I have not have any regrets, except I didn't do it sooner.  There are over 7600 miles on the odometer and aside from a minor issue with the radio harness being loose and leaving me without a radio for a few days and two oil changes, my GTI has not seen the dealer.  There was also an ignition coil pack replaced under a recall, however I never experienced any pack failure.

I moved from a 1998 Audi A4 into an '03 GTI so I could finally get a 5 speed and my wife could take over the A4, and I have felt at home.  Volkswagen does an excellent job in design and material selection, especially when it comes to interiors.  My GTI 1.8T was loaded with everything but stability control, or ESP as VW calls it.  I paid a premium to get all of these creature comforts, but I was coming from an A4, and couldn't give up that much.

Volkswagen should consider being more aggressive on pricing the GTI to make it competitive with the Dodge Neon SRT, Ford Focus SVT, Acura RSX, Toyota Celica GTS, etc.  This car has a lot of potential and VW could have easily squeezed out better performance numbers for this price.  You need not look farther than the aftermarket to find out how.  I expect many of these minor quibbles will be worked out in the 2005 Golf, already available in Europe.

The primary reasons I elected to get a GTI include the versatility, interior/exterior design, options available, and performance.  I have moved furniture, boxes, bulky items, you name it, and the GTI held it all.  Today we moved a Christmas tree, but we did need to tie the hatch door down.  All you need to do is slide out the headrests and reposition the rear seats and its almost like a wagon.

Being a loaded vehicle, there was little more anyone could as for in this GTI.  The few things I would add are power seats, self-dimming rear view and side mirrors, a trip computer and automatic climate control.  That list is nit-picky and I'm sure most people considering a GTI, would be happy with what's there, but most of what I mentioned is available on the VR6 variant.  I opted out of getting a VR6 solely based on the ease of squeezing more oopmh out of the 1.8T.

All in all, this car is fun to drive.  The acceleration is outstanding.  It's very easy to get where you are going as quickly as traffic will allow.  For the handling, I would like better grip at the limit, but the GTI is responsive and communicates well with the driver as to what is happening on the road.  You can also rest assured if things go awry, there are front, side and head curtain airbags to keep you safe.  The GTI is still a contender in the sport compact market it had essentially created over 20 years ago.  With the upcoming MKV Golf platform in 2005, we sure to have more GTI fun for years to come.
