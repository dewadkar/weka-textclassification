            Having experienced Hyundai en-masse in Korea, I can honestly think of very little bad to say about their autos.  For someone looking for a very reliable, reasonably priced (in today's world), and well thought out vehicle, the Elantra would be it.

Hyundai currently has the best overall warranty going in the US, a 10 year
100,000 mile power-train warranty, 5 year bumper-to-bumper warranty, and 
5 year no-mileage limit roadside assistance.

I have owned Hyundai products for the past 9 years, my most recent being a 1999 Elantra.  The best of everything is there for all to see and experience.  The exterior is appealing to the eye, and the interior is extremely well appointed.  In most cars of this class, there is often a problem entering or exiting the car, both front and back.  Not so the Elantra.  The roominess inside seriously makes you think you are in a larger car.  Both adults and children have no trouble at all.  As for the instruments and amenities, everything has been well placed and shows the time and effort put into listening to their customers suggestions and making them a reality.

One would think that the engine in this size car would be lacking in output and acceleration .  Again, the Elantra puts to rest the &quot;lawnmower&quot; sound of the engine and delivers very respectable performance, as well as providing excellent gas mileage.<br><br>
