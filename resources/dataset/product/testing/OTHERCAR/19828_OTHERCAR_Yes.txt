               <b>M</b>aking its first debut as a concept car in 1993, the Impala SS gained such a response from the general public that it was put into production a few years later. With a Corvette/Camaro/Firebird/Caprice/Roadmaster LT1, 350 cubic inch V8 engine, and a tight suspension, this is one of the most exciting huge sedans of the mid 1990s.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

       <b>Big Z-rated tires</b>, a healthy LT1 350 V8 engine and a relatively stiff suspension make the Impala SS a very fast large car, especially with its sleeper appearance. On back roads, and down the freeways the Impala's ride is superb. Although it retains a live axle, the Impala is well behaved, though oversteer is very easy to induce. <b>Acceleration</b> is this car's forte, and with 260 hp (25 less than the 1996 Z28) from its LT1 V8, this SS can blast past traffic right up to 100  MPH without any fuss, however this speed is not recommended, save it for the track! This OHV V8 is coupled with a GM 4L60 E 4-speed automatic. Huge 12-inch, four-wheel disc brakes gives astonishing stopping power. 

 Unlike the Corvette Engine., the Impala unit has cast-iron heads and exhaust manifolds, resulting in 260 wild horses. It featured Multipoint fuel injection, and electronic engine control and ignition. This engine can rocket the SS's Mass to 60 mph in under 7 seconds (according to specs).

     Chevrolet engineers saw the potential of the Chevrolet Caprice as the basis for a huge performance sedan. Stiffer springs, and anti roll bars are fitted, and 'de carbon' shocks improve the ride and handling. Heavy duty police spindles and huge 12 inch disc brakes give excellent stopping ability. All this, and exterior modifications, turned the sedate Caprice into the Impala SS.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> of the Impala SS is relatively luxurious, it's no Cadillac but for the price you don't expect it to be one. The leather is made of high quality, the bucket seats are very supportive and comfortable, and there is tons of room everywhere. The Impala boasts power everything, including power seats, antenna, windows and door locks. Automatic headlamps, tilt steering, and a floor mounted shifter that was all new standard equipment for 1996 (the Impala's last year in production). The Impala also comes with a 6-speaker premium sound system that sounds excellent.

The overall Interior set-up is of relatively high quality, however GM was not exactly known for making a super luxurious automobiles in 1996 and the Impala SS is no exception. The plastics seem cheap and the dash seems dated for the '96 model year. The Impala has a stark black interior which helps hide some of these underpinnings, this doesn't hide the fact that GM could have improved the Impala's interior a great deal. I would have also liked to have seen much more bolstering with the seating for aggressive driving.
   

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

The <b>exterior</b> looks much like a regular Chevrolet Caprice, but there are differences. The Impala comes with different headlights, tail lights, larger tires, and that Impala SS badge of honor written on the rear side of the car. There is also 3 little badge's in the form of an impala on 1 of each of the rear sides, and the other larger one on the rear of the car. The Impala SS comes standard with sexy alloy rims, and dual exhaust ( I love dual exhaust). Unfortunately the tail pipes point down, like on much cheaper cars, i.e the regular Caprice Classic. A straight pipe with chrome tips would have been a nice visual feature.


<i>Pricing:</i>

    Aimed at a small band of enthusiasts, and only built for 3 model years, the Impala SS has gained a small cult following. A few cars are going for more than their original sticker prices because of the demand for these cars. Expect a '96 Impala SS to set you back around $20,000-30,000. New these cars were  around $25,000, so resale is excellent. I forecast that these cars will go up further in value as the years pass by.

   I can not comment on reliability, Although I would love to own one, I don't, and driving one 2 times would not give me grounds to rate in this category. I suggest talking to a non selling owner before buying one.


<i>Conclusion:</i>

 With high levels of performance, and exclusivity the Impala is recommended.
