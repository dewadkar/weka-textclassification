            Just love this car.  Bought it because I've always enjoyed German engineering and design.  My fourth beetle, I've had a fastback and 2 dashers also.  New beetle is spacious, has a great sound system and great heat and ac.  Handles like a gem.  Already has saved me from two accidents, one a dead deer on highway and another of a van turning in front of me at an intersection.  Acceleration is very adequate with the stick, I do a lot of highway driving and top end acceleration is sufficient.  Got it below MSRP after working 3 separate dealers.<br><br>
