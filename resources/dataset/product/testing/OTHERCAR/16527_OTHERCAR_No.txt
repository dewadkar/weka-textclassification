            We bought this car new for my wife on March 1, 1996.  We also bought the extended warranty for about $800.  The kicker with the warranty from Congressional VW in Rockville, MD was that if you did not use it you would get your money back.

I should have known that with an offer like that I would be using it.

To start with VW's standard warranty SUCKS!!  I think it was 20,000 miles.  Anyways, I think the first problems I remember having with it were:

Rear passenger driver window failed - replaced regulator.
Map lights failed - wires installed wrong - replace wires
Oxygen sensors failed - replaced.

These all happened with less than 20,000 miles, so they were covered by the standard warranty.

Since then, (we now have 76,000 miles on the car in February of 2002) we have had all but one of the windows fail for a total of about 5 fixes.  I think they have replaced 5 regulators and 2 motors.  This cost $25 in deductible each time we took it in, but the main problem was getting the appointment.  

One time (at band camp) the driver window was stuck in the down position.  They could not get the car in for a week, so I had to drive around with the window down for 5 days.  Luckily we have a garage at home, and at my office.  But there was one day I had to drive home in the pouring rain! 

The alarm has been a problem, however not recently.  It would go off occasionally when the key was removed from ignition, but doors still locked.

The car stalled last week, and the CHECK ENGINE light was blinking, but then became solid on.  Took it to my mechanic and had the timing belt replaced, and a tune-up for a total of about $750.  The CHECK ENGINE light is still on because my mechanic does not have the diagnostic tool to turn it off, and it drive as if there is a governor on it.  I am thinking it is a catalytic converter problem.  I am trying to make an appointment to take it to Congressional VW, but they never answer the phone or call me back!

Also the trunk latch and the wires that go to it broke, so the trunk is stuck closed right now.
