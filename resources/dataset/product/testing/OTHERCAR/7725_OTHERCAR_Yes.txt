            This car is absolutely amazing.  I own a 1991 Sundance.  

The space in the back seat is surprisingly large.  I am a pretty large person and this is the first &quot;small&quot; car to ACTUALLY fit three comfortably in the back.

The trunk space is great too, especially in my hatchback with the fold down seat.  I can fit everything in there and is close to as functional as a truck (especially with some bungie cords). 

The power is stronger than you would think too.  

The car has lasted well too.  I have had no major problems and it is at nearly 85,000 miles.

The only negative is the features of the car.  The radio sucked, so I replaced it.  I would have preferred power doors and windows too.  But that might be optional.

I truly can't think of a bad thing to say.<br><br>
