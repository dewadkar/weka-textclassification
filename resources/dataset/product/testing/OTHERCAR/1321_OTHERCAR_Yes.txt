            For a year my wife has been pining for a Volvo C-70. At 44, she has worked hard and deserved nothing but the best and so  when we decided to go look at one, it was love at first sight for both of us. The design is supurb and it is definitely a beautiful car. The interior oozes class with body hugging leather seats, wood grain panel trim and every gadget known to autokind to tease the mind and soul of a car lover. The dealer was hungry for a deal so in just a couple of days we had the keys in hand and off we went.
The first thing we noticed was how quiet and well mannered the car was for a convertible. Usually rag tops have plenty of rattles and wind sounds to accompany your ride. The top is well insulated and solid with an integrated glass rear window (with heater). At highway speed, we enjoy a ride nearly as quiet as an enclosed sedan.
Handling is faultless with solid road feel and responsiveness. The turbo engine boosts you along quite easily and we have found that staying below the speed limit takes a lot of attention and self control. The turbo power is a real plus for dodging in and out of precarious traffic snarls.
From a safety standpoint, this is the first convertible in years that I feel safe in. With front and side air bags and pop-up roll bars, Volvo have stayed focused on safety and created at the same time, a work of automotive art. The side air bags are a part of the seat assembly so the air bag is always positioned in the correct spot no matter how you set your seat.
The sound system is a 400 watt, 12 speaker pro logic surround sound mega-theater. With a three or six disc CD player, radio and tape player, you have everything you need to either duel with the kids "boom-boom" cars, or blast your self into oblivion. I thought the sound system was overkill, till I heard it. The extra speakers and wattage comes in handy with the top down at 70 mph.
It is when you drop the top that things really get good. The one touch top handles everything, windows, locks, stowing the top and then covering it with a hard boot. Same thing with putting the top back up..just push a button and it is all done for you.
There are not many of these beauties on the road so cruising around is fun. The car is unlike most Volvos so it usually catches a lot of attention. If you like to see and be seen, this is the car for you. 
At about $46,000+ for a fully equipped model, the C70 is pretty pricy but for us it is well worth it.
