            Prior to purchasing a Ford F-150 4x4 a couple years back, I had owned a Ford Explorer and Chevy Blazer.  With our frequent ski trips from our home in the Seattle area, we need a good 4x4 vehicle.  With last year's high gas prices, I started researching a possible replacement for my '98 F-150.  I wanted something luxurious, something with 4-wheel drive, something with roomy back seat for passengers, something with good fuel mileage, something with room for our lab and dalmatian in back... 

The best value kept coming back to me as the Hyundai Santa Fe. I compared it directly to the Honda SUVs, Mitsubishi, Ford Escape, Isuzu and others.  Hands down, the Santa Fe couldn't be touched.

The first thing that impresses you when you sit down, is a solid feeling of quality and thoughtful design.  Quite frankly (and I love Hondas), the CRV and Passport felt "cheap" and uncomfortable by comparison.

Back to my story:  Gas prices went down and we cooled down on the idea of replacing the truck (which we loved, by the way).  Then in October, my wife's parents were about to buy a new car.  They were interested in the PT Cruiser, but I suggested they look at the Santa Fe.  No way, they said.  Not a Hyundai.  Still, they gave it a test drive... and fell in love and purchased it the same day.

Ski season started, and the truck just wasn't cutting it for me.  Even with lower gas prices, the 1.5 hour drive to the ski slopes was high, not to say anything about the cost of commuting to and from the office each day.  

So we went to Costco and got their $99 over invoice deal ... and purchased a crimson 2002 Hyundai through a dealer in Tacoma.

This is a brand I NEVER thought I'd own... A Hyundai?  No way.  Famous for burning out engines and falling apart.  But not anymore.  The warranty speaks for itself.

Fact of the matter is this SUV drives like a sportscar.  It has about the same interior room as my old Blazer (a little less than the Explorer) ...and in a recent trip from Canada to Seattle (freeway), we got about 29.6 miles per gallon!  That's double the F-150!

We have all-leather interior with heated seats (my wife's favorite option).  The stereo is very good and climate control is a real bonus.  I have absoluely no regrets.

I'm about six-foot, and at first it seemed that there wasn't enough legroom for the driver (no worries on the passenger side or back seat).  However, the seat adjusts six ways.  When it occurred to me to adjust it up, my right leg no longer cramped.

The back seats are very roomy with lots of head room, which is unusual for those used to Hondas.  Very comfortable with ample legroom.  In fact, the back seats even recline.

Handling:  We got the V-6 automatic, which has plenty of get-up-and-go.  It's easy to go well over the speed limit and not be aware of it.  So far, the Santa Fe has done very well on snow and ice.  No complaints.

If you consider a Santa Fe, get the full-meal deal.  We purchased ours with all the options.  There's really no other way to go.  My wife's parents don't have the upgraded stereo and climate control, and they now regret it.

In conclusion, this is just a fun car that is very distinctive.  It's a rig that gets noticed.
