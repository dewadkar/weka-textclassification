            The Infiniti I30 is absolutely one of the great luxury cars out there. It has made many improvements, since 1997, and the 99' model I30 is a great deal. The I30 has a formidable 190 hp, 205 lb-ft, 3.0L dohc V-6 engine, 5-speed manual transmission, and great fuel economy (21/28 mpg- city/highway). When I took a ride in this car, I knew a car worth buying. The seats are very comfortable (even though its a little cramped in the back), and it is great on the trips to long outings. The interior has a pretty good design, and the exterior design gives this the finishing feel to a good luxury car. The steering and handling is great, and it makes a comfortable ride to wherever you are going. The only thing bad is that this car is kinda compacted. But for about $30,000, I'd say this is a car which makes it a good buy.  <br><br>
