            Test Car: 
1999 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 

Features as tested: 
8 cyl 5.7L Engine, Air Conditioning, 16" Chrome Wheels, Monsoon 500w 8 speaker AM/FM/CD Audio System, Anti-Lock Brakes, Automatic 4-Speed Transmission, Center Console, Dual Front Air Bag Restraints, Intermittent Wipers, Limited Slip Differential, Cruise Control, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Rear Spoiler, Tachometer, Tilt Steering Wheel, Tinted Glass, Leather Seats, Acceleration Slip Regulation (traction control), Fog lights 

Interior: 
The interior of this car is one of the biggest downsides.  In order to keep the car affordable, the interior suffered.  The interior is cheap plastic snap-in parts that don't fit seamlessly.  The leather bucket seats are fairly comfortable for short trips, but after 3-4 hours they start to get uncomfortable.  The rear seats are very small, there's simply no room back there.  The seat construction for the rear seats is poor, the bottom of the seats aren't even attached to anything, they are more like cushions.  Fortunately, the rear seats fold down and provide a sizable increase in back deck/trunk space.  The dashboard console is cheap looking as well.

Exterior:
The exterior of this car is sleek and well-rounded.  This is a beautiful car, that oozes speed.  The coupe doors are heavy and well made.  The panels are dent resistant and have a solid construction.  The T-tops are high quality and are a real pleasure to have.  I have found the design of the weather stripping to be poor.  If you go through an automated car wash (pressurized water), you will get a few drops of water coming in through the top of the window.  The weather stripping retains water when it rains, so opening and closing the door will prompt water to drip down the inside of the window.  Do to the affordable pricing, quality in the body and frame are supposed to suffer a bit, but I haven't noticed anything.  The stock Goodyear tires are absolutely horrible.  They don't grip the road, they wear quickly, and have poor rain traction.

Engine and Suspension: 
The 5.7L LS1 V8 is the same engine used in new corvettes.  This is one of the most established, well-made engines ever conceived.  Its proven and time-tested.  It puts out almost 340hp at the chassis.  I know what GM says, 305hp for the Z28 and 320hp for the SS.  This is incorrect, they clocked down the numbers because they didn't want it steal the thunder from their flagship performance car.  The only difference between the two cars is the intake manifold and the programming of the computer.  The heads and cam are exactly the same!  The 4L60E transmission (automatic) is a well built unit.  The is infinitely upgradable, for those performance junkies (like me).

Economy: 
With a 16.8 gallon tank, the automatic transmission version is rated for 19mpg in the city and 29mpg on the highway.  Unfortunately, I have not found this to be quite accurate, its a bit overrated.  I believe it to be more like 17/27, if you don't punch the gas often (and you will).  The real killer here is the price of premium (93 octane) gasoline.  The manual states it is possible to use 87 octane, but you shouldn't do that to this engine, it will knock, ping, and detonate.  You just bought a muscle car, never use regular gas unless you have the V6 version.
Additionally, oil changes get expensive, because of the synthetic oil that SHOULD be used in this car.  Get used to ~$40 in materials alone for oil changes.  Additionally, replacement tires for this car are expensive, as they are high-end performance tires.  The upkeep for this car is expensive, but that's true with all sports cars.

Reliability: 
Contrary to popular belief, late-model Camaro's don't have reliability problems.  Actually, Consumer Reports rated this car above average.  The windows role up slowly and have a reputation for bad motors.  Personally, I have only had one universal joint replaced and that was under warrantee.

Misc: 
Don't even think of driving this car in the winter.  If you have to, you need four wheel snow tires (Like Blizzaks or Arctic Alpins) and 100lbs. weight in the trunk.  Combined with the above, the ASR and ABS might just keep you out of a ditch.    

Performance:
I'm sure this is the section everyone is eager to read, here goes:  The acceleration of this car is absolutely astounding, you can smoke the tires with ease.  The middle range power is what's really awesome.  You really have to watch yourself when gunning it to pass people, you can go from 50mph to 90  in the blink of an eye.  The car is governed at ~165, which is plenty.  Additionally, the Camaro has a rigid suspension that is famous for minimal role in cornering.  Taking corners at speed is one of the most enjoyable experiences of this car, it begs for a windy mountain road.  

People who looked at this car should also take a look at:
1.  Pontiac Firebird Formula Coupe
2.  Ford Mustang (one of the V8 models)
3.  Acura RSX
4.  Pontiac Grand Prix
5.  Subaru WRX 

Final thoughts: 
Overall, I absolutely love this car.  The power, speed, and performance almost equals a corvette, for $20,000 less!  Driving this car is intoxicating, it oozes adrenaline.  Cornering is absolutely incredible as well.  This is one of the biggest bang for the buck cars out there, you can't go wrong.  It has a few drawbacks and isn't for everyone, but if you love performance and power, this is your car.
