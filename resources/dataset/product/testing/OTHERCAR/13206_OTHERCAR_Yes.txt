            Despite being a gadget freak, i waited for several years until digital cameras hit a sweet-spot of function/form/value. I had several criteria for evaluating products: accurate colour translation, at least 3.0mega pixels, open standards (smartcards, usb, software), durability, and name brand reputation. The camera had to be superior to all but the most advanced 35mm cameras.

The Canon A70 meets all of this criteria. It is smaller than a typical 35mm camera, and is the result of several earlier generations of A## models for Canon (all of which get excellent reviews). It is also less expensive than the roughly equivalent S## series Canon produces...and I prefer the ergonomics of this camera more than the S series.

I had exactly 30 minutes to experiment with the camera before i headed to a wedding. All of the features were self explanatory and easy to use, and didn't require extensive reading before hand. The automatic and pre-set modes are easy to use, but more advance modes allow for settings of resolution, FStop, ISO exposure, flash, filters, and picture size. Basically, this is a camera that is easy to use out of the box, but rewards additional research and experimentation by including advanced features.

I'm impressed with the LCD quality. I'm impressed with the menu functions (e.g. thumbnails, digital zoom). The toggle wheel is a great feature which most other digital cameras in this range lack. 

I can't stop raving about this camera. My first batch of photos developed on the 2nd lowest picture resolution setting came back with better clarity and detail than a normal 35mm point and shoot camera (comparison: Canon Sureshot 85). 

The only recommendations I would make to Canon are: include a case for the camera like you do with your 35mm cameras, and upgrade the size of the 16mb smartcard to 32 or 64. The card included is rarely used as the default, but at 16mb its not even worth me carrying around as a backup.
