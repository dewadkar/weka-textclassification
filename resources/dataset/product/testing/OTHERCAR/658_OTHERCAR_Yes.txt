            After using 35mm film cameras for over 30 years, I am now a diehard fan of digital.  The 950 is my second Nikon digital product.  My first, a refurbished Coolpix 900, has been a trusty companion for over two years.  Therefore, I purchased my Coolpix 950 as a factory refurbished unit.
     The Coolpix 950 is basically an improvement over the older 900 and 900S models.  The 950 has a much better feel, a faster CPU and more exposure controls to get that special effect you want.
     I won't go into the pros and cons about this camera because other writers have done a much better job of this.  What I would like to do is save you some money if you decide to purchase this camera or any other camera for that matter.
     I use google.com as my search engine for everything related to the Nikon 950.  From there I have found pricing sites such as pricefinder.com, mysimon.com and pricewatch.com.  You will also find some great Nikon 950 user sites which deal with every aspect of this great camera.
     I paid $359 for my camera at ubid.com.  It was factory refurbished and came with a 3 month warranty for labor and parts.  The new camera warranty is 3 months parts and 12 months labor.  So you are only giving up about 9 months for parts.  When I received the camera, it appeared to be brand new and never used.
     You will need to purchase a CF card reader because the serial interface is just too slow.  A SanDisk USB CF reader cost me $15 at ubid.com.  Shop around because more and more companies are coming out with their own line of readers and cards.
     I highly recommend that you buy at least a 48MB CF card.  I prefer Viking and Lexar because of their improved controller technology and lower cost vs Sandisk.  Since the prices are falling as I type, the 128MB cards should be selling in stores for about $75.00 by Christmas.  I have already seen them go at this price on ubid.com.  You can also purchase 48MB cards at ubid.com for about $30-35 at the present time.  I purchased a Lexar 64MB card last month for $48 from, yes again, ubid.com.
     Next on your shopping list should be Nickel Metal Hydride batteries (NMHI) and a quick charger.  I purchased 16 AA, 1600MAH Nexcell batteries on ebay.com for $1.91 each.  That equates to 4 sets of batteries for use in my camera or PDA, TV remote, FRS radio, flashlight or whatever device that uses AA batteries.  NEVER waste your money on alkaline batteries again!  For about $35, you can get a great charger and 4 1600MA NIMH batteries from thomas-distributing.com.  The charger can be used at home or in your car and will fully charge your batteries in about 2-3 hours.  Also check out their rechargeable battery packs.  They fit in shirt pocket and will last a long, long time!
     In closing, you will not be disappointed with the Nikon 950.  I rated this camera as 5 stars because it gave me the most "bang for the buck".  Feel free to contact me at jdduvall@ptw.com.  I am not affiliated with any brick & mortar or dot com company.  I just enjoy getting the most bang for my hard-earned buck!
