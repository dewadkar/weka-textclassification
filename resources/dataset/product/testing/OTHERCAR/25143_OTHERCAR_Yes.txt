            I bought this camera 18 months ago and still love it.  I've used higher resolution cameras (a couple of 3 & 4 megapixels and one 5 megapixel) but haven't found a more useful model than this anywhere, except the new 3.3MP Powershot.  It fits in your shirt pocket, takes web quality video shorts (very short - about 5-15 seconds, depending on how clear and fast your CF card is) with sound, has good software, and yes, 18 months later, it still has EVERYONE asking about it every time I pull it out.

My daughter was born last year, we have taken thousands of pics.  The good thing with kids is you just snap as many pictures as you can so you guarantee good shots (you can always use the bad ones to blackmail them when they reach their teens).  This camera has really enabled us to capture great moments - I know that is general to digital cameras, but it is the SIZE of the S110 (and its new 3.3Mp version) that make the difference.

Summary:
- good pics up to 5x7 without photoshop
- great size you can always take with you (although recommend to use the LCD or the backlight flashlamp for aiming)
- battery life is ok.  not great, but not terrible.
- zoom is ok.  optical would be better with true 3x, but it works. digital zoom is terrible on all digi cameras.
- video would be better if the camera had more and faster internal memory, but works ok with faster CF cards (slow ones kill the video time).  It is Avi, so you'll need a converter for making home DVDs.


The quality is great for 5x7 prints and does decent 8x10s - although if you clean up the digital master using Photoshop you can enlarge even further with great quality.  For anyone who doubts this, check out what many of the reporters in Afganistan are using - this very camera.  If the prints are good enough for Time and Reuters/AP new services, they are probably good enough for personal use!

Some people find the battery life short.  I get about 70 shots from it, but it recharges in less than an hour and you can always carry a second or third battery.  Spare batteries go for about $30-40 (try eBay or get even lower costs using a good magazine and pricematch using Amex).

It takes CompactFlash cards, which have dropped so nicely in price that I would never mess with newer SD/MMC cards.  Why spend more to get the same deal in a slightly smaller package, especially if the camera is bigger to boot.  Latest card I bought was $40 for 128MB - that is a lot of pictures for me, and probably the maximum number of shots you could take on one battery charge if you used the camera in the most efficient mode (LCD display off, no backlighting - which I never use because the LCD is so much more convenient than the normal viewfinder, especially given this camera's size).

I am still happy with this camera after 18 months of heavy use.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
