            If the surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese Forces on Sunday, December 7, 1941 was the decisive, defining event that propelled the US into WWII, without any doubt, Jeep General Purpose or "GP" vehicle helped get the troops where they were supposed to be to kick butts.  In fact, the legendary performance of US troops in the fields was greatly facilitated by this vehicle that went over hills, river waters and rocks.  Obviously, Jeep has gone through a lot redesigns and touch-ups until our current version.  If you want reliability and durability, a sense of comfort and safety on the road, you will bypass its competitors.  You will go for <b>2001 Jeep Cherokee 4WD</b>.  I have been driving Jeep Cherokee for a number of years now.  Except for the normal maintenance including oil change, tire checks and changes and a few part changes, I have never had any major problems.  Every day, I've seen a lot of drivers stranded on the side of the roads in brand new SUVs.  My Jeep is the loyal friend.  She is there for me whenever I need her!

Just a few weeks ago, I was checking my A/C in preparation for the Summer heat.  One does need working A/C in California.  I realized I had to change the Compressor and related part.  While shopping for the part, I asked the sales person what he thought about the SUVs.  It did not take him long to reply that he could afford one, he would get himself a new Jeep.  He added that I should try to find a Jeep in a wrecking yard or dismantling shop.  In fact, it's very hard to find an old Jeep lying around in a self-help yard.  Jeeps continue to be prized possessions.  Owners don't let them go to rut!

<b>2001 Jeep Cherokee 4WD beats its competitors</b>

Some of its competitors include 2001 Ford Escape, 2001 Nissan Pathfinder, 2001 Mazda Tribute, 2001 Chevrolet Blazer, 2001 Ford Explorer Sport, 2001 Mitsubishi Montero.  It comes equipped with a 4.0liter inline 6-cylinder engine.  Automatic transmission is standard.  It comes equipped with all other standard features.  

If you are on the market for a new SUV, I will advise to put your money in something that will last you.  Forget about being stranded on the road.  You may not even have to use AAA.  I have it, but never have I had to use so far.

Good luck shopping for your dream vehicle!
