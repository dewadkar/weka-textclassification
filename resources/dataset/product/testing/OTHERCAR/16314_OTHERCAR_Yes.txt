            My husband and I recently bought the Hewlett Packard C200/C200xi and we have nothing but good things to say about it. We did a great deal of research on the internet looking at many different brands of digital cameras that offered different options. We came to the conclusion that this camera would be the best choice for us in terms of its performance and its price. 

I had never used a digital camera before and found this camera very easy to use. We recently moved to Alaska and I wanted to take pictures of our new home and our unique surroundings to post on my web page for our friends and family to see. I already have a scanner, but the digital camera gives me a whole other option. 

The software that comes with this camera is also very user friendly. We have not had any problems with the battery dying, which was a concern of ours. The camera gives you the option to choose from three levels of quality for the picture and I have found that even the lowest is good quality. Overall I am very pleased with our purchase and would recommend this product highly!<br><br>
