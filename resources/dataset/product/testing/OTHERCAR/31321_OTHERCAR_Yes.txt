            We purchased the MPV last January 1999.  We were looking for a 4WD vehicle that could also handle 6-7 passengers.  We decided to purchase the MPV because it looks and handles like a SUV but was priced much cheaper.  We were unable to find a real mini van that had the 4WD feature.

I love the &quot;truck&quot; feel to driving it.  Although all other minivans handle like a car, the MPV has much stiffer suspension, and being a 4WD, sits much higher, giving you a better view of the road.  The seats are really comfortable for the long haul, especially the rear bench seat.  The rear bench seat is quite heavier than other minivans, but that is the trade off you get for more passenger comfort and support.  We opted for the two captains' seats in the back seat for better access to the rear, and we're glad we did.  The instrumentation is okay, nothing out of the ordinary, but adequate.  The standard CD player/radio has buttons that are too small and I find it difficult to operate by feel at night.  Also, the interior lighting could have been done better.  Other minivans offer more gadgets, such as cup holders, etc., than the MPV, so if you're looking for those things, a regular minivan would serve you better. The two front cup holders get in the way of the CD/radio when in use.  We could have bought the console between the two front seats, but instead, my husband made one for me out of plywood that I covered in black naughehyde.  With a purchased cupholder/money holder/CD-tape holder top, it works better than the Mazda one. The gas mileage isn't that good, though, again more like a truck than a minivan.  I drive a two-hour round trip three times a week to evening graduate school classes, so even though we've owned it for almost a year, it has about 21,000 miles on it already.  We have had absolutely no mechanical problems with it and are very satisfied with the quality.  The oil filter is difficult to access if you do your own oil changes.  You have to remove some kind of a cover to get to it.

All-in-all, I would recommend the MPV to anyone who wants the driving feel and towing ability of a truck or SUV along with the convenience of being able to comfortably haul passengers and cargo.  I really enjoy the drive!   <br><br>
