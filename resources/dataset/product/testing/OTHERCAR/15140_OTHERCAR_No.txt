            ...I would've stuck to the bus. I have a theory that my Grand Am hates itself as much as I hate it, and is trying to commit suicide. There is no other explanation for the things that have consistently gone wrong with this car.

If I were to define this car in terms of a human relationship, I would tell you it started out good enough, we had some laughs. But slowly this car turned into the drug addict ex-boyfriend that you deny even knowing. The kind that still calls you at 3AM, completely trashed, trying to convince you that the two of you could still work. Don't be fooled by the sleek and attractive exterior. My car has had a plethora of constant, bizarre problems. Sure, things will be great for a two or three months, leading me to believe that the problems are over and maybe, just maybe, things are going to work out this time. But then I get dragged back into the abusive cycle when it fails to work again.

It started out minor; when I got it, previously owned, the speaker wires were cut so I had no radio. Hey, I thought, that's easy to fix, and before you know it, the background driving music resumed.

Then the brake problems started. Hey, I thought, that's not so bad, the last guy who had it probably didn't treat it very well. I can fix that.

Then the transmission problems started. I was starting to get nervous.

Odd power steering problems began. I said, hey, I can overlook that.

Then muffler problems. I said, Car, we can work through this. We've had some problems in the past, but I have a feeling they're all over now.

Then more brake problems. I started making excuses for my car. I thought the worst was over, that maybe I could change him into something driveable.

Then, I was leaving the &quot;Sup-R Qwik Oil Change,&quot; when my transmission started acting crazy. The car was in the shop for a pretty decent length of time, and I had to pay a pretty large 4-digit sum to get it back. Apparently, my car, wallowing in self-pity, decided it wanted to be a standard transmission instead of automatic. The part of the transmission that went out essentially made my car run like it was a standard. The only problem is, it actually being automatic, I had no way of shifting.

Car, I said, you don't have to change for me. I'm glad you're better. Let's never fight again.

And for awhile, we didn't.

But, of course, things can't stay good for long. Last night things took a turn for the worst. I can't be certain, but I think he tried to commit suicide in downtown Austin. I was turning a corner coming home when all of a sudden, instead of four wheels, I had three. They say there were joint problems that caused the axle to separate from my car. But I know the truth...

When I get my car back from the shop (which is going to involve maxing out two credit cards), I'm going to have to explain that if he wants to be a tricycle, by god, he can be one, but I'm not letting him take me down too. It's over between us. The last payment is next month, and he's out of my life. For good.

And I mean it this time.
