            My 1998 Chevrolet Camaro has been such a great change for me from my 1991 Ford Escort.  About a year ago I was involved in a multiple car accident which left my best friend paralyzed from the waist down.  After this accident I was left to bed rest for 7 weeks, and during the majority of this time was spent searching for a new car.  Being lucky just to be alive after the condition my car was left in, I wanted something that would be really safe, but also looked good.  After extensive research I was surprised to find that the Camaro was one of the safest cars on the road.  After learning this, I decided that this was the car for me and was lucky to get a great deal on my purplish-blue (I love the new color) V6 1998 Camaro.  My Camaro is so much more fun to drive than than my Escort.  Being a young college student, I love the way I feel when I pass drive by others in such a great looking car.  My mom and I even took it on a road trip over Thanksgiving and actually found it very comfortable.  The reclining bucket seats were great.  And the sound system is great, I have even had people think I have a stereo put in by just listening to my factory system.  The only drawbacks I have with this car are that the gas mileage is not very good, in fact it's pretty much a gas guzzler, and that it took me almost a year to figure out how to work the hazards (I guess it would have helped if I had read the manual or something, but who has time for that).  I've only had to take my car into the shop once, to get the brakes worked on, but they fixed the problem under the warranty &amp; so far that's the only problem I had, although it wasn't really a problem, just something the previous owner had started to get worked on.  The only way my car could be better if it were a Z28 or a SS.  The Chevrolet Camaro is a great looking, sporty, and fun car to drive for all ages.  I will be really sad to see it go, but I am glad that I got one of the last models they will make.<br><br>
