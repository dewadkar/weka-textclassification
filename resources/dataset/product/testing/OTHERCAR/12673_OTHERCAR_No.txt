            For my sixteenth birthday I got a 1997, emerald green, 2-door Cavalier.  I loved it!  We went everywhere together.  It had a CD player and cruise control so I was set to go.  It was a sharp, inexpensive car that got me where I needed to go.  It got wonderful gas mileage.  I can thank my mom for buying it for me.  I can thank Chevrolet for all the problems that I have encountered since.  

For the past three years I have treated my car like a baby.  My car got washed and filled up with gas every weekend.  I never misused it or did anything it didn't like.  For that reason I do not understand why it has given me so many problems.  The first two years were wonderful; I had no problems---except for a speeding ticket but I am at fault.  It also had a recall on the airbag.  

Now as my Cavalier ages, it has gotten senile.  Around 33,000 I noticed a knocking type of sound in the engine.  I took it to the shop.  The mechanics discovered the knocking was a bad piston.  I don't know much about the linguistics so I can't explain the problem in depth.  The dealership claimed this problem was frequent and had many Cavaliers in for the same problem.  Bells went off in my head---common piston problem meant common engine problem!  We were few of the lucky ones who discovered it under dealer warranty.  I ended up getting a rebuilt engine for free.  (A rebuilt engine usually costs around $3000 with labor and parts.)  Well I figured when I got the car back the next week, it would be good as new.  WRONG!!!  The dealership forgot to put some bolts in when they were putting everything back together.  The antifreeze container was not bolted in at all.  It was completely loose.  I took it back and got that fixed.  Should be good as new, right?  WRONG!!!  My boyfriend is a mechanic so he inspected it when I got it back.  There was an even worse knocking in the engine.  

I am dreading taking it back to the dealership.  The current problems include:  the second gear light not functioning, a loose air vent that squeaks, engine knocking, a antifreeze container not strapped it (it got bolted but never strapped on visit #2), loose engine mounts, non-functioning cruise control, and possibly a bad transmission.  All these problems do not make me feel so good about my car.  If it has this many problems at 33,000 miles, then what is going to happen around 60,000 miles?  100,000 miles?  It sure makes a person wonder.

I want a new car but I can't afford it.  I am starting to wonder if I can though with all the problems.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have had my mom buy a different car.  My mom doesn't say much, but she can't feel too good about the situation.  

I am not trying to steer you away from a Cavalier.  It is a wonderful car when no problems exist.  I am just trying to make you an informed consumer.  I might also say that Cavaliers do not retain their value very well.  Cavaliers also have a bad reputation during side-car collisions.  Personally I would like to be as safe as possible.  All types of cars will have some problems.  Nothing is perfect.  Just be wise in your car-buying decisions.<br><br>
