            I decided to go with the 328 after much research into the field of luxury sedans.  I considered many of the major brands and test drove some of them.  Most importantly, I spoke to many owners of the various cars.

The 328 was a luxury car from a rock-solid name that delivered everything I wanted at a surprisingly affordable price.  It drives like a dream, handles and corners perfectly (even in the rain!), and is incredibly quiet.  I get 23/28 mileage, pretty impressive for its class.  The dashboard layout is intuitive and makes it easy to see exactly what is going on at all times. I found the control layout to be intelligent with the exception of the onboard computer, which makes you take your eyes off the road to see it.

But you probably knew all that already.

I'm writing this mostly to describe their pre-owned program which I think is beyond a doubt, the most superior in the market.  I have been pampered every step of the way, with every minor issue addressed immediately and personally by my salesman.  The car was in immaculate condition, and handles exactly as promised.

In short, the pre-owned program allows you to get into a great car at an incredible price.  Clearly the way to go for those seeking to get into the BMW experience without having the lay out the full amount for a new car.

If you are looking for a great CD Changer to go with the factory radio, and don't want to shell out the $700 for their six disc look here:
