            Chevrolet has created many safe vehicles in its day, but when the designers created this design of cavalier they didn't design it to take a crash very well.  Reason for my opinion is that my 8 years of running a auto body shop seeing all the different designs of cars and how they take collision.  Not saying that the crash tests that they provide aren't real and how they say a car is safe in those tests but how many people have you ever known run straight into a wall?

During a collision the car has a large tendency to take on alot of frame damage in the front end, even in the smaller crashes which run around the $2000 mark which in accidents it is small.  Unibody vehicles are made with what they call are crush zones they are areas specifically on the car made to take the damage some are holes are others are bends but the problem with the Cavalier it always takes on frame damage which shouldn't happen.  Considering the problem with the unibody what happens is that insurance companies total out the vehicles alot because of amount of repairs are more then what the car is worth, sad thing is what they feel what the car is worth usually is under what the owner still owes on it.

Understandibly no person ever does expect to get in a collision, but accidents do happen and when they do the most and only important thing is that a person walks away un-hurt from it.  Chevrolet did make a cost effective car and does have many good things to it don't get me wrong it is great on gas mileage and at todays prices that's a must also the look is a very cute, many added options can be added to it also.  But altogether the vehicle would not be one I would personally my family in to unless I could afford to buy another vehicle immediately if for some bad reason I was to get in a accident.
