            And, unfortunately, TWO For The Show. We also got a great buy at Thanksgiving on the 640 with Photomax CD and carry case/patch cords. We also had to take back the first one after about two dozen pictures were down loaded.

It first began with the LCD screen going blank, even though it was just turned on. At that point we could tell something was up. It shortly thereafter refused to flash, even with the green indicator light showing a ready flash state.

So far, the second one appears to be functioning o.k., it IS very user friendly and the only complaint is that the icons to depict resolution and remaining capacity are difficult to decipher.

The software is fun to goof around with; special effects will have your sides splitting in no time and you can make your own gift cards.

I guess for the money, the 640 is not a bad way to go, just make sure you can get an exchange during the first 90 days or so of purchase. Good luck and keep laughing, Rob American.
