            I had a leased 2001 Acura CL Type S.  I was not going to keep the car when the lease matures.  So instead of waiting for the maturity of the lease, I decided to start shopping for a permanent car.  I also needed a 4 door sedan back since I got engaged this past May and is for future family purposes.

I considered several models.  The models included the Acura TL Type S, Infiniti I35, Toyota Camry XLE, Lexus ES300, Jaguar X Type, BMW 330i, Nissan Maxima GLE and the Mercedes C240.  I did my research and build the vehicle in the website for each of these potential vehicles.  Though all of these cars are great, I narrowed it down to the Acura TL Type S and the Infiniti I35. Originally I made a final decision in buying the Acura TL Type S. But I decided to take a 2nd look at the Infiniti I35.  Comparing the I35 and the TL, the TL truly lacks in features.  The I35 gives more for the money than the TL.  The gadgets, including the simplest of things, and the convenience within the I35 was impressive.  What the TL don't have, comparing it with the I35, is: power rear sunshade, digital compass on the rear view mirror, heated seats including the rear, heated steering wheel, split folding rear sears, spacious trunk, trip computer, bright xenon headlights, fully open moonroof and terrific italian leather.  The instrumentation for the I35 is neatly detailed. Looks terrific when driven at night.  What is most impressive is the Bose 200 watt sound system.  The I35 comes with a 7 speaker system with a subwoofer located in the rear center.  The sound from this system is awesome and crystal clear.  It has the bass sound I like that the Acura lacks.    Even though the TL has a Bose system too, it sounded like it only had 120 watts, no bass at all.  

After taking delivery of the I35, I already knew this car would last me a very long time.  The performance and handling of the car is amazing.  The 3.5 V6 engine comes with 255hp, 246 torque.  The engine has been rated as one of the best in consecutive years.  You will not feel the jolt when the gas is stepped down .  The ride is smooth, comfortable, and quiet.  The wood trim within the interior brings the nice elegant look.  There are plenty of room within the cabin.  I recently had my windows tinted to bring out more of the beauty of the I35.  For further protection, a Lo-Jack was installed for this vehicle.  And of course, a further discount for the auto insurance.  

It's no wonder that the I30 & I35 are the best selling vehicle for Infiniti.  Infiniti has come a long way in attracting customers, I am definitely one of them.  Consumer Reports has place the I35 between the Acura TL & Lexus ES300.  In my opinion, the Infiniti I35 should be first in line for a 30's luxury sedan.  The I35 gives you more for what you are paying for.

I am looking forward in taking my first road trip with this car.  It will be a joyous adventurous trip.  So anybody looking for a luxury car in the 30's, they should consider the Infiniti I35.  A major improvement over the predecessor, the I30.
