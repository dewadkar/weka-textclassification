            We own a 1993 3 speed automatic Toyota Tercel DE that we bought new in 1993 and have had a love hate relationship ever since. There are some great selling point on this car. It starts in all weather, is built Toyota tough and Toyota reliable. Having said that, in retrospect, I would strongly urge consideration of the Toyota Corolla as the better deal. First the good points:
1) Reliability and solid construction. Even after 7 years of punishment, it rides smooth with no rattles or vibration. After almost 50,000 miles, our only expenses have been for routine maintenance items. Handling and braking are excellent!
2) A reasonable amount of space. We could easily carry 3 adults and 2 infants in car seats for long distances. The trunk space is adequate to say the least. We have driven 250 miles at a stretch with ease.
3) Excellent service from the Toyota dealers.
Now the bad points:
1) Relative to the size of the car, gas mileage is poor. I get better gas mileage on my 1987 Honda Accord 5 speed! 
2) Noisy at speeds above 55 mph. It is almost impossible to listen to the radio at speeds above 75 mph.
3) Cheap seats and lack of &quot;creature comforts&quot; such as a light in the trunk, interval wipers, remote side mirrors and a tachometer in the base model. The trunk is not lined and has a particularly tinny sound to it when closing.
I suspect that the Tercel 5 speed would have been the better buy and would therefore suggest passing this car over in favor of the standard transmission model. However, if the price is right, this is an excellent car for in city commuting and going to the grocery store! The only hesitations I would have would be to suggest the Corolla as it is bigger, has a more powerful engine and (likely) has better crash survivability and to suggest purchase of a more recent vintage car given the lack of airbags in this model.<br><br>
