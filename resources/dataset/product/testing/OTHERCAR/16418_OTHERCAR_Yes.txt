            About a year ago, I purchased a 775 from Dell.  900 pictures later, I'm happy with the money I spent on this camera ($310 after price-matching).

The biggest advantage to this camera is its size.  Sure, there are many cameras out there that will provide superior picture quality and have setting adjustments that will appease the most advanced of photographers, but with most of those cameras, you have to think twice before you bring it with you.  I've captured many great moments with this camera because I didn't have to think twice.  It fits in your pocket with ease and you'll soon forget that it's even there.  It's made out of plastic, so it looks almost like a toy, but it's well made and very sturdy.  I dropped it once and it still works fine.  

The picture quality is good, not great.  Colors are represented well, but not as vibrant as some of the other digital cameras that I've seen.  The pictures do come out a little soft, but this can be corrected by using the sharpening function in Photoshop.  I've printed many 4x6 pictures from the camera, and most of the pictures look quite nice (haven't tried 8x10 yet).  

The downside of this camera is it's slow startup time.  It takes a good 10 seconds for the camera to be ready to go.  Picture to picture downtime is less, but probably still slow overall.  I think the slowness might be due to the memory card I'm using because I remember the camera being faster when I still had the 8 MB card that it came with.  Once you get used to it, the slowness of the camera is not a major concern.  You just have to think ahead a little before you take a picture.

If all your picture taking consists of point and shoot pictures, then the 775 is a great option.  Even if you are a professional photographer, I think you will still find some use for it because of it's portability.  You'll take pictures that you never would have taken before because you'll have this camera there for those unexpected moments.
