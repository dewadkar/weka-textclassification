            Spring arrived in northern West Virginia this week, and as I raced through town in my trusty Prelude, sunroof wide open, I thought how nice it would be to have a convertible to tool around in on beautiful days such as we have been experiencing.  With that thought in my head, I took off for the nearest Mazda dealership to take the Miata for a test drive.

Now I have lusted after the Miata since its introduction ten years ago, and have known the exhilaration that comes with being a passenger in one.  The recent restyling of the Lotus-inspired original has poised the Miata to enter the new millenium in grand fashion.  The coupes good looks seem to be paired with reliability, I often see used models with over 100,000 miles on them.  The price is low compared to other convertibles, with loaded models comparable to the rather cheap looking Ford Mustang.  And if you are willing to go without a lot of luxury options, the fun of an open air coupe can be yours at economy car prices.

So, I headed to the dealer with images of low cost fun in my mind.  I arrived and was disappointed to see that there was only one Miata in stock--a fully loaded model with a shocking sticker price of $26,000!  Not only was it overequipped for what I had in mind, but it had been finished in silver with a tan top and interior--which I felt was a garish scheme. Undaunted, I decided to try it out anyway.  The salesman fetched the key, I opened the door, inhaled the aroma of leather and took my place in the cockpit....immediately the love was gone.

My five foot eleven inch frame was pressed against the convertible top...the steering wheel was digging into my thigh.  There was no tilt feature, and the seat was as far back as it would go.  I simply did not fit in the car!  Crestfallen, I handed the key back to the salesman.

I think the Miata would be great as a Sunday driver with the top down.  And for very small people it would make an exciting daily cruiser, but for everyone else...I am afraid that our enjoyment of the Miata will have to be gazing at it across traffic!
