            There is a new Korean car company here in the US. 
They are Daewoo.  I checked out the reviews of the
Daewoo Lanos hatchback on this website because
they are one of the only places to even list Daewoo
cars as a choice!  I was disturbed when I read the
some of the reviews though.  They wonder why anyone 
would risk buying this car when they have no idea of its
reliability.  They suggest that buying a Honda
civic, or a Used Integra (?!) would be a better
choice.  The writers obviously didn't know that
Daewoo had been on sale for a number of years
already in such large markets as Britain and
Australia.  The cars have been top sellers and
have garnered glowing reviews from the media and public
in those areas.  In Korea, the Daewoo is quickly
eclipsing Hyundai as best sellers as well.  Why? 
The Daewoo Lanos offers for 12,000 what one would
have to pay about 16,000 for a comfortably
equipped civic, corolla etc.  I know I tried looking.  
For about 12,000 you can get a civic or corolla with
auto, and that's it.  Maybe A/C if you are lucky,
forget about any power accessories or ABS.  The
Daewoo Lanos for about the same price offers auto,
power windows, door locks, ABS, AC, CD player, dual
airbags etc.  What got me was the power door locks
and windows.  You can't even get those on the
civic or corolla unless you step up to the LX, or DX
models respectively.  Also you the Lanos looks
fantastic!  The back looks very civic-esque while
the front looks strongly reminiscent of the BMW
323 hatchback.  By the way I don't work for Daewoo or
anything like that.  I myself own a Daewoo Nubira,
and my girlfriend owns a Lanos, and we both
absolutely love them!  She purchased her Lanos for
about 12,400 with All power accessories, dual
airbags, auto, ac, cd player, alloy wheels etc. 
Also remember that all Daewoo cars come with 3,
36,000 mile scheduled maintenance for free!  Also
24 hour roadside assistance for the same period
and an excellent basic warranty.  Now if the Daewoo
were such a unreliable car, why would they
back their cars up with such a tremendous
warranty?
 Pretty much that all automotive journalist are
infatuated with Japanese cars, and for good
reason too, but in my opinion, they over analyze any problem a
non-Japanese competitor might have, and not
accentuate the values they might.  <br><br>
