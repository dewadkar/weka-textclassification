               I have had the opportunity to drive (not own) the 1999 Lexus LS 400.  Now I do own a 1999 Mercedes CL 600 (be sure to read my review on that too), but for the money you will pay for this car, about 55,000 new, you can not ask for a nicer ride, or more features.  The engine is a whole other story (yes I love that too).  My mom leased the car in 1999, and since I was a fellow Lexus owner, I was quite anxious to see how the "Flagship" car performed.  Most striking about the car is the enveloping quality of the interior.  Plush leather and wood surrounds you, and as soon as you put the key in the ignition, the steering wheel tilts down as if to say "drive me, I'm yours."  The stereo is also top notch, a 7 speaker Nacamichi with 8" subwoffer in the back.  Other nice little extras include heated driver and passenger seats, sport shift transmission, cigarette lighters in all 4 doors, beautifully lighted gauges, and ample room in the back seats and trunk.  And of course like all high end luxury cars these days, it comes with the Lexus ESP (electronic skid protection),which can be shut off, just for a little extra fun.  Now onto more entertaining things...engine and performance...

     Now you must be thinking that with a car this size, surely it can't be all that fast.  Oh but it is.  As a friend of mine put it, its pick up from about 20 mph is "scary fast."  It pulls ahead of any other V8 in its class, (except for the CLK and E 430 Mercedes).  Shifts are so smooth, you hardly even feel the car move.  120 feels like 50.  Its super smooth all the way up to nearly 150mph.
Braking is exceptional, steering is a breeze, and handling is exceptional, thanks largely in part to the ESP.  However, punch this off, and you will be able to do quite a nice rear wheel burnout,(yes, it is rear wheel drive) even on dry pavement.  Youre sure to impress the kids.  Do a little sport shifting, and you can get off the line even faster, not to mention the fact that its more fun.  This really is an excellent car.  My only gripe is that the tires seem to go bald every 10000 miles, but maybe thats just my moms aggressive driving style...
