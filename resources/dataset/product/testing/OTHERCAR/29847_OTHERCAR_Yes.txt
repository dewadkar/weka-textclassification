            I actually purchased my truck in Nov 2000.  At that time this truck was the best value for the money.  Most small trucks were about the same size and had about the same performance options (V6 over 4 cylinder, etc) and they even had about the same MPG.  After quite a bit of research I discovered that the Mazda B2500 SE was my best bet.

I purchased a 2001 Mazda B2500 SE 2.5L 4 cylinder, 5 speed manual.  The difference between an SE and SX model is that an SE model has alloy wheels, AC, and a CD player all standard.  During my research I discovered that these trucks are just Ford Rangers with a different body.  So this truck has fully exchangable parts with a Ford Ranger and can even be serviced at a Ford dealership.

To simplify, I'll break this down into sections:

PERFORMANCE:  This truck only weights 2500lbs empty.  This means that my 119hp engine feels pretty powerful as it doesn't have a whole lot to push around.  This makes the truck quite nimble.  From a dead stop you can acclerate very quickly like if you were in a sports car.  However, just like a good truck should be, all of it's power are in the first three gears.  It doesn't accelerate very quickly in 4th and 5th gear.  It's center of gravity is relatively low allowing it to corner well adding to the overall 'sporty' feel when you drive it.

When used like a truck, it performs better than it should.  Just a few weeks ago I loaded up 3/4 tons on the back (a bit more than the factory recommended 1/2 ton) during my move across the country.   When fully loaded it didn't completely flatten the springs like I expected.  It stayed fully loaded for about a week during the trip.  Of course it's nimbleness was gone, but it had sufficient power to get me over the mountains doing 65mph.  When I unloaded it, the truck suspension sprung right back up to it's original height.  Nice. <b>28 Jul 03 UPDATE:</b> Lately I've been using it to haul construction material.  Loading up 800lbs of dry concrete and a 6 4"x4"x10' chunks of lumber didn't even phase it.  I'm extremely satisfied with how well the suspension has weathered.

One thing I did discover though, the stock tires are not the best tires for rain and snow.  Wet roads almost completely kill any kind of cornering traction and in snow 2x4's in general do poorly; this truck is no exception.  If driving in snow, snow tires are highly recommended and adding weight (sand bags, bricks, etc) to the back will greatly improve traction.  I learned that the hard way.

I bought this truck because my last one finally died beyond financial repair ('84 Nissan Pickup 256k miles).  With my daily 70 mile commute I needed a truck that would also be somewhat efficient.  When driven aggresively it only gets about 21mpg.  But when I cruise on the highway I can get 25mpg easily.  Not bad for a pickup.

INTERIOR:  The cabin is incredibly roomy.  The seats feel comfortable even on long road trips.  The seats have stain resistant material that cleans easily (even grease stains come out).  You can seat two adults and one child in the middle without problems.  The shift stick is sufficently seperated from the seat that a child can put their legs there without getting hit when you shift.  Three adults is possible but not the most comfortable thing to do as the middle person has to dodge the shift stick.

All the controls are within reach (for me, 5' 7" tall).  Since I don't have a power package all the windows are crank, and they roll up and down with ease.  a nice add on they did was to add a second 12V socket (in addition to the lighter socket) to plug in 2 things at once.  Like most cars nowadays the entire console and the doors are made from a plastic-like material.  This means that it does scratch moderately easily but it's a cinch to clean if it gets dirty.

EXTERIOR:  One of the most appealing parts of this truck was the body styling.  It doesn't have any excessive styling yet it's still sleek and 'modern' looking.  I especially like the grill design as it gives the whole front of the truck an 'agressive' look to it.  The paint itself has not chipped on it's own, although small rocks have managed to rip off paint.  The paint has maintained it's factory glossy look even after 2 years.  The rims that come with the SE model are attractive and do not require replacement unless you wish to get racing wheels go with bigger tires (stock are 15").

<b>UPDATED</b> MAINTENANCE:  I have now put 57,500 miles into my truck in just over 2.5 years.  75% of those miles have been highway miles.  The only work I have ever put into it has been 3,500 mile oil changes and it's 30,000 mile scheduled maintenance.  I've had zero problems with it.  If this is any indication of the rest of it's lifespan than I'd say it's a well built truck.

BOTTOM LINE:  I have had a wonder ownership experience with this truck.  I haven't had to give my truck a second thought whenever I had to do something with it.  I've taken it off-roading for paint ball, up the mountains of Colorado in the dead of winter for skiing, and even into the jungle of inner city Los Angeles and it has never let me down.  If anything were to happen to this truck I would not hesitate to purchase a new one again.
