            I don't actually own a GMC Sonoma, but my roommate does, and he has even let me drive it around a bit.

My overall opinion -- if someone were giving it to me, then fine, I'll take it, otherwise I really wouldn't pick it out on my own.

Let's take a look at some reasons for and against the Sonoma.

<b>For</b>:  Decent gas mileage, around 25 mpg on the highway.  In this day and age you definitely want a car to get some mileage.  This isn't the best, but considering our SUV world it's decent.  My old Jeep might get 25 on a really, really lucky day with the wind pushing me.  But I don't have it anymore (darn Dump Truck!), so I don't worry.

<b>Against</b>:  Small engine.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a 4-cylinder-phobe, but truly, this engine has no pickup.  If you read my roommate's review on this (the only other Sonoma review currently), you'll see what I mean.  You have to floor it to get anywhere.  The college we attend is located on the top of the hill and you have to rev that sucker up to get to the top.

<b>For</b>:  Plenty of storage space.  It's a truck, so it has a bed, which means for us college guys plenty of room for whatever we need to pack to get wherever we are going.

<b>Against</b>:  Little, to no seating room.  There are two front seats (as my roomie said, the 60/40 bench seat), but there is virtually no back seat and even the front seats are a little cramped.  This doesn't make it too fun for our 800 mile trips back home to Michigan.

<b>For</b>:  In the time my roomie has had his Sonoma I haven't known him to have to take it in for anykind of repair or service other than routine oil changes.  He's had the vehicle now for nearly 2 years.  I'd say that's pretty good.  The Cherokee I used to have and the Caprice I am driving now have both been in and out for little things, recalls, etc. all the time we've had them.  I'll never forget the time the computer chip that ran the fly-wheel gave out on the Cherokee, fun time.

Those are just a few things, pro and con, about the GMC Sonoma.  It's a truck, sure, but if you really want a truck for what you need a truck for (hauling big stuff, farm work, etc.) don't bother with it.  It's more like a toy truck, good for tooling around town, nice for college kids, but not efficient for major work projects.
