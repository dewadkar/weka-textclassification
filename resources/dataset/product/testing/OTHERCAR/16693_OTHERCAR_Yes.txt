            I actually do not own this camera, but had the fortunate priveledge of borrowing a friends camera for 6 months! :)  I used it mainly to take pictures of my baby when she was born.  
<b>The Good</b>

Real nice pictures, I couldn't believe that this was a 1.3 Megapixel Digital Camera. The floppy disk media makes transfers to PC much easier albeit doesn't store a whole lot of pictures.  Not too mention that floppies are cheap!  Ten second MPEGS are a cool feature especially since they are small enough to email even to your relatives who can not or will not get broadband. :) The LCD Viewfinder was realtime, unlike the cheaper cameras who feature choppy LCD images that makes it almost impossible to use it.  The FD85 also uses Sony camcorder batteries so if you own a Sony Handicam, then you do not have to go out and buy rechargeable batteries.  

I emailed my pictures to my friends and co-workers and they all admired how nice the pictures came out.  They refused to believe that they were from a digital camera.  I even had some snobby guy who never likes anything tell me that it was a nice camera. The zoom is also real nice, the optical zoom is clean and sharp, who cares about the digital zoom we all know that they suck!

<b>The Bad</b>
The floppy disks would only hold 20 JPG pictures.  Imagine holding 50 floppys in order to do a serious shoot!  The Price! Ouch, $300 for a 1.3 Megapixel?  Do you have a bridge I can buy as well?  

<b>The Ugly</b>
This mama's huge! It is the size of a small camcorder! I know Sony is now using CD-R's (the smaller ones) for it's newer Mavica's, but with the floppy drive, this is one big camera!  Image a floppy disk drive, and a webcam with a Series L camcorder battery.
