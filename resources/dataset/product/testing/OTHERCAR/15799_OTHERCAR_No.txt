            We bought a 2000 Chrysler T/C LXI from a local dealer during the fall of 2000.  This has been our 4th MOPAR minivan, and 3rd T/C.  We have 3 small children (all under 10yrs old) and we would be hard pressed to put them in anything other than a MOPAR minivan.  Two of the (4) vans were involved in accidents--one broadsided by a guy in a GM car doing 40mph, and the other was all but totalled when a guy made a left in front of my wife on a local highway.  In both cases, my wife and three little ones sustained no serious injuries (kids also all in car seats).

This 2000 T/C though, at a hefty price of $32K, has been somewhat of a disappointment.  At 35K miles, it's needed the following service:  1. Complete front brakes (pads worn to nothing, rotors too thin to be serviced), 2. Replace both front headlamp assys (fogged up on inside), 3. A/C doesn't blow cold (just blows "cool"--been in several times, no resolution), 4. Battery failed, 5. Stock tires (Michelins) needed replacement at 30K (tread low, front had torn belt), 6. Intermittant humming noise from DS radio speaker (with radio off) when hitting bumps in the road, 7. The "Customer Care" 800-roadside assistance was poor.  Called twice--once for dead battery and they sent a guy from 35 miles away (took him 1.5hrs to arrive), second time for help changing a flat (sent a guy from 12 miles away, rude teenager showed up also 1.5 hrs later after wife already changed flat).

For a standard-Caravan or Voyager I guess we'd expect some things like this to happen, but for tires/brakes at 35K and the other plethera of maintenance issues I'll have to say we're very disappointed.  I hope Chrysler gets their act together or the next vehicle we buy will be an import.
