            My 1989 Plymouth Voyager just will not die.  It has safely taken my family through thick and thin.  Although it has over 170,000 miles, it runs great and the interior still looks new.  We had to replace the transmission four times but considering the mileage, it's nothing.  The repairs have been rather inexpensive and the car has never let us down.  My husband travels over 110 miles per day and never hesitates to take the car anywhere.  We have gone from car seats to college trunks. My children have also learned to drive with this vehicle.  We have had a few fender benders which have not effected the car's performance.  The bottom of the passenger door is starting to rust a little but considering what she has been through, it can be repaired for a few hundred dollars.  It is easy to get replacement parts and my husband always comments on how comfortable the seats are.  It is a great family car!<br><br>
