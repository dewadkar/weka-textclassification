            The Chevy Lumina is a great car.  It has comfortable seating for at least 4 adults. It has a nice list of standard features and the cost is not high at all.  The best part of this car is how it handles.  It runs very smoothly and handles bumpy roads as if there were few potholes in them. It stops easily but not overly fast. Seats easily adjust as do mirrors.  I have had very few visits to the repair shop with this car.  It even has a very spacious trunk to store all your gear in.  With this car your road rage at being uncomfortable cramped into a car with few features and poor handling but at a modest price will vanish.<br><br>
