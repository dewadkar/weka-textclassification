            My wife and I were interested in buying a four wheel drive vehicle since we live in New England and are planning on having children.  Since we are on a tight budget, the Kia Sportage interested us for it's affordable price.  We had noticed them first at a dealership on our way to Vermont and thought they looked neat.  That's about as far as my love for this vehicle got.

It seemed o.k. when I test drove it but quickly ran into problems there after.  Within the first two months of owning the vehicle the air conditioning unit failed and had to bring the Kia into the shop three times to have it replaced.  There is always excessive brake dust (which is impossible to get off) on the front wheel rims.  Also, in the morning I have to let the car warm up for about five minutes or else it won't shift into fourth gear until I drive about three miles.  When I press the power button, the light does not come on if it is cold.  Also, I would get more pick up from my cat pulling me in a sled than I do from this tiny little four cylinder engine.  My wife's Toyota Corolla seems like a sports car compared to this.  Maybe it's just because I went from owning a sports car to this, but I have driven lots of cars and this is the worst pickup in a car that I have seen.

I have gotten four recalls on the Kia since I have owned it and am currently hearing a grinding noise when the wheels start spinning.  The ride is also very rough.  The one thing I do like about the Kia is the cd stereo system.  That's about the ONLY thing.

I am sorry that I took a five year lease out on this vehicle but I guess I have learned from my mistakes.  I will not buy one of these vehicles again.  On the last day of my lease, I am walking into the dealership and throwing my keys at them!  I really wouldn't recommend this car to anybody.  It's o.k. for about the first year and then you really start hating the vehicle.    <br><br>
