            Make no mistake, I am Subi man through and through. I first drove a 1992 Legacy Sedan and have never looked back. Since then I have owned a 1993 Legacy Wagon Turbo, 1995 Legacy Sedan LS, 1997 Legacy Outback Wagon, and a 1999 Legacy Sedan SUS. And now my 2000 Legacy 2.5 GT Sedan continues to give me stylish and reliable transportation in the Subaru Tradition.
I live in New Hampshire and we get our fair share of snow up here. Like many people in the area, 4WD is a necessity for me. And also like many people I made the mistake of buying some SUV's. I hated the way they rode and the way they handled, but I needed 4WD and a pickup truck just wasn't practical for me. One day I borrowed a friend's Legacy on a snowy day (while my 4 Runner was in the shop for the third time in a week) and I was in heaven.
There are only a few negative things I can say about my Legacy. The gas mileage isn't that great for a car due to the AWD (about 25 mpg on average). But it is still a heck of lot better than any SUV or Truck. The 2.5 liter Four cylinder engine is also a little weak. At 165 horsepower the power is ample but not great. A K &amp; N high flow air filter helped out quite a bit though. I understand a 6 cylinder 220 horsepower Legacy is due out for the 2001 model year. That is something I look forward to seeing.
If you have to drive in snowy conditions, a Subaru is the one and I only car that I would recommend.<br><br>
