            After the birth of our second child we realized that the car we had was too small.  We decided it was time to buy something bigger and decided on a mini-van.  We looked around at several different mini-vans and did decide on the 2000 Nissan Quest.  We wanted a base model to keep the price down but also wanted some extras.  The GXE included many options we thought we would have to pay extra for.  Some of the extras that were included were tinted windows, power doors and windows and the extra sliding door on the driver's side.  One extra that I was shocked by was the TV/VCR.  My daughter loves this when we are on a long ride.  We did spring for the Comfort Package which gave us some more options including the AC in the rear.  The cost of the package was very reasonable.  We are impressed by the pep that the engine has.  It drives like a car and not at all like a van.  The minivan is very roomy and very comfortable.  We are very impressed and happy with our decision.<br><br>
