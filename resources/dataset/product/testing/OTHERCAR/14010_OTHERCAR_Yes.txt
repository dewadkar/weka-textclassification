            I had no intention of looking at the I35 until I had the let down of driving the Sexy G35.  I love the looks of the G35, but the suspension is much too tight and the car is too noisy.  Therefore getting into the I35 seemed like a dream.  I've had the car for 6 months now with no major problems to report at all and really only one minor one.  A slight rattle has developed in the dash, which I think is somehow related to my navigation system, which I might add I never thought I'd use and have ended up loving once you get past the education of how to operate it.  As I said the rattle is minor, though having been a prior Infiniti owner I hold them to a higher standard than others.  The pros to the car I would say are as follows:  Lots of bang for the buck.  For the price they are asking (I got mine at dealer invoice)you get quite a bit.  The engine is powerful and quiet, except when you lay into it and don't want it to be quiet.  The cabin is very tastefully laid out and appointed.  Everything seems to bespeak of quality.  The back seat room is average, not good, not bad.  The stereo is excellent.  The A/C will freeze you out. (Which is generally not the case in Japanese cars) The Xenon headlights are cool.

The Cons to the car:  (Now understand that I am a highly picky person with extreme attention to detail)  The single biggest, hugest con to this car is the turning radius.  There is no other way to put it other than it sucks.  Also, there is a cup holder on the passenger side of the car that is right in front of the a/c vent.....WHY???  Also, I wish that Infiniti should have chosen different tires (I believe they are run flat tires and therefore quite hard) for the car because it makes the ride stiffer than it really should be.  Understand I'm not looking for that American "floating sofa" kind of ride, I'm just saying that for an Infiniti Luxury Sedan that the ride is mildly stiff.  Now, again this is me being picky, but at night the color of the dash lights, the stereo lights, the climate control lights and the navigation system lights don't match.  I have colors ranging from white to blue to green.....mildly unnerving.  Oh, also the way they positioned the back lighting of the famous Infiniti clock....you can hardly read it at night.

Again, my cons are petty I realize.  I wouldn't say this is a great car, what I would say however is it is a great car for the money.  I would absolutely recommend this car to anyone looking to spend $27k-$35k.  I think the only one to make out better in this deal than me will be the person who owns one of these automobiles used!!  (Prior to this time I bought exclusively used cars so obviously I got a deal I couldn't pass up to make me buy new!!)
