            I bought my 1998 GMC Sonoma SLS Regular Cab 4-cylinder 5-speed brand new in April 1998.   The day I took it home, I started to notice problems.
First, the decals were put on crooked, and some were already starting to peel off.  The fenders and the hood were out of alignment with each other.
The entire front end (bumper, grilled, headlights) was loose-to the point that you could wiggle the headlamps back and forth.  The dealer said this was &quot;normal.&quot;  Right!   About 3 months into this ordeal, the interior plastic parts started breaking.  All of the plastic seat trim is now gone, and there is a crack in the glovebox door.  The ashtray has wedged itself open somehow and will not close.  One day I went to shut the door, and the entire driver's door panel came off in my hand.  Not to mention that the door seals leak (have been replaced once by the dealer), which has led to the carpet smelling like mold.   The passenger side window is very hard to roll down as well.  The white paint chips *very* easily and the entire truck has paint problems after 40,000 miles.   The newest body problem is that the door hinges are sagging, and the dealer says they cannot adjust them anymore.  I used to work in a body shop...tried to adjust them myself, along with the loose front end...to no avail.   Due to the door seals leaking, I just found rust on the bottom of the doors and the floor pan.

THIS IS RIDICULOUS in a truck with only 40,000 miles.  Add to this all the squeaks and rattles inherent in GM products....

The transmission went out at 30,000 miles.  It began with by popping out of fifth gear, and then it got stuck in first gear.  They wound up replacing the entire transmission, clutch, clutch linkage, shifter assembly, and shifter linkage under warranty (they told me this would have been well over $3000 out of warranty).  Now at 40,000 miles, the clutch is slipping again and the transmission pops out of third gear.

The dealer here in Louisville, KY was VERY RUDE concerning the transmission problem.  I am a volunteer firefighter/EMT, and they took one look at the red lightbar on top of the truck and said--without even looking at the truck, and I quote:  &quot;You volunteer firefighters are really hard on your vehicles.  That's probably why it broke and we don't fix abuse problems under warranty.&quot;   !!   I demanded to see the dealership owner, and he said that he left all decisions on service up to his service manager.   An angry phone call was placed to GM Customer Service in New Jersey, and they wound up fixing everything free of charge under warranty.   I will not have my truck serviced at this particular dealer again.

10,000 miles later, the clutch is going out again.  And now the problem to top everything off is that there is a short in the wiring harness that causes the truck to suddenly go dead, like the battery is dead.  But:  the battery has been tested and found to be fine.  The alternator was tested and also is functioning properly.  I disconnected my red lights and siren to see if that was the culprit...nope.   It goes dead at random.  I have noticed that the problem is worse after it rains or the truck has been sitting on grass overnight.   The dealer I purchased the truck from says it is faulty connectors and loose wires in the wiring harness plus a bad ignition circuit.  This is apparently a common problem as they have seen it several times.  Water leaks in from the top or condensation comes up from the bottom (like being parked on wet grass in the morning), the moisture gets into the wiring harness and shorts it out.  I was told that they would have to replace the entire truck wiring harness as they cannot replace a single &quot;section&quot; of the wiring.  The part will be over $600 plus another $200++ for labor.   There was a recall of earlier model Sonomas for wiring harness problems, but this truck isn't effected the dealer said.   Jump starting the truck does not work.  The battery is fine, so the excess voltage from trying to jump it has ruined my am/fm/cd player and blew up my CB radio.  I have to wait for the thing to dry itself out then it runs fine.   It has left me stranded about 6 times in the last month.

That does it.   I will never buy another American-designed vehicle again.
I am contemplating a Nissan Frontier or maybe a VW Jetta diesel to replace this dog.  

Oh, it only gets 19mpg which is pitiful for a 4-cylinder, and it has absolutely no passing power.

I'm aware this anger-filled review may not be helpful to some, but I wanted to pass along my GMC horror story as a warning to others.<br><br>
