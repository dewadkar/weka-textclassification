            and she is wonderfully cheery &amp; capable although she can be a wee little bit moody every once in a great while . . .

We wanted a medium-sized car that would seat 6 for my in-home day care. I am more comfortable driving a smaller vehicle, so it was great to find the roomy, but not-too-big Acclaim. We're all rather long-legged, but ride comfortably even on long trips.  The Acclaim seats 6 when needed, BUT the 6th person has to ride in front in the middle so you (the driver) will want to be sure this passenger is scrawny, NOT wiggly, has blunt elbows, and doesn�t spit when he talks.

Features Include:
2.5 Liter Electronic Fuel Injection 4 Cylinder Engine
3 Speed Automatic Transmission
Front Wheel Drive
Power Steering &amp; Power Brakes

Air Conditioning-Non CFC Refrigerant (okay this was MY first car with AC &amp; boy do I LOVE it � have had NO problems at all with the AC!)

Rear Window Defroster
Tilt Steering Wheel &amp; Speed Control
Child Proof Rear Door Lock System
Steering Wheel Air Bag System

Front Passenger Motorized Passive Belt System (this is a pain, as it sometimes refuses to budge &amp; you have to unhook it + you have to remind people to buckle the bottom belt)

Power Door Locks
AM/FM Radio w/ Cassette

Luggage Rack (we�ve never actually used it, but have decided that it adds a classy look that some other Acclaims lack)

City MPG 22	Highway MPG 27
I average about 25 miles to the gallon with almost totally in-town driving.

We haven�t had a LOT of problems with Celestine � we did get the 7 year extended warranty, so our deductible is only $50 for most things � that�s one less thing to worry about.

Problems we have had:
DEC 1998 � Heater didn�t get hot - Heater Core plugged &amp; thermostat had to be replaced (temp. gauge needle would read HOT &amp; then go quickly back to normal).
AUG 1999 � I heard an odd, kind of creaky noise whenever I turned right or left. The rear axle assembly was cracked (no known reason for this to happen). Cost to replace? $616. This was NOT covered under the warranty. I called Chrysler Customer Service (1-800-992-1997) &amp; talked (nicely) to a representative named Beth. She called the dealer &amp; then called me back &amp; made me a wonderful deal! I agreed to pay $100 &amp; Chrysler �paid� the rest.
JAN 2000 � Replaced thermostat (again) � temp. gauge zipping around again. Everything else okay.

Mostly I like the way the Plymouth Acclaim handles. It�s roomier than a small car, but I feel comfortable driving it &amp; can judge my distance well enough to parallel park with ease - not that I parallel park unless I absolutely have NO other choice within 3 miles . . .

My 16-year-old is learning to drive in Celestine &amp; has gotten the �feel� of her quite easily. Although I have occasionally found myself bracing both hands AND feet on the dash (Yikes! Just like MY mother used to do!), I feel pretty comfortable with her ability to handle this car.

To make a statement AND be easy to find in parking lots, she proudly wears 6 or 7 red MADD ribbons on her antenna. She sports a dragon on the passenger side dash &amp; a few glow-in-the-dark stars throughout her interior. There is a blanket throw in the back seat � for the Chihuahua (much like the Taco Bell guy, but longer-legged) who likes to ride along on school pick-ups, but is always cold. To be honest, Celestine is not just our family car . . . she�s Family!
