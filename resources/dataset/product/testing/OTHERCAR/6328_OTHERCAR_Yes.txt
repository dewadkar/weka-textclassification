            I wanted a used Minivan and I chose the 1998 Toyota Sienna because of price and because Consumer Reports rated it their best minivan of 1998.  That year was Toyota's first venture into minivans so there wasn't much of a history on it.  Even so, I trust CS and compared to the Honda Odyssey it was okay.

Overall the car is good.  It has good pick up, good gas mileage, low maintenance and Toyota�s good name backing it up.  However, our right-side sliding door did have problems opening from the inside until it just stopped working all together.  Toyota did fix this problem at no cost.  The removable seats are somewhat heavy (the middle seats more so than the rear) but not excessively so.  The little control knob on radio broke off, too.  $7.00 repair for that.

All the ride of the car is good I wouldn�t say the seats are fantastic for long drives.  I get a little uncomfortable after several hours.

As to what other folks were having problems with: no brake problems as others are having, AC working is fine, I can move my hand back behind me to adjust the rear controls if I have to, but I�m flexible.  I haven�t had much of a problem with storage areas, but I can see the other people�s point of view.

Over all it�s, well, ho-hum.  Dependable, durable, long power-train warranty (75,000 miles) but, well, I wished they�d put a little more into the rest of the vehicle as they did in the motor.
