            Yes, it is a Lexus and yes it drives, handles and feels like a Lexus which is great. BUT; The styling is horrible in MY OPINION!
This latest incarnation of the ES 300 is retro styling at it's absolute worst! What were Lexus's stylists thinking? Yea, this car drives excellent as any Lexus. And it has Lexus's superlative fit and finish but the damn thing looks like a baby hippo on wheels. I thought we were through with the horrible "jellybean" round feminine styling of cars. Think early Nissan Altima, Ford Taurus and early to mid 90's Toyota Camry and I forgot to add that awful first generation of Toyota Avalon. I hope this design is a sales failure. What was once a clean masculine, compact excellent design has deteriorated to this? 
My job involves driving many different cars. Most of them tend to be expensive sedans, roadsters and those darn SUV�s. At first, I mistook the ES 300 for a Ford Taurus or first generation Alta. When a guest pulled up in this shiny tub I congratulated her on the pristine condition of �her vintage Nissan Altima.� Fortunately, the young attractive woman driving this monstrosity that calls itself a Lexus had an excellent sense of humor. She told me this was her boss/lover�s car. She agreed with me that it was an ugly duckling on wheels. 
Fortunately, as I mentioned earlier, once inside and at the wheel, this thing felt and handled like a true Lexus. To me, that �Lexus� feeling means a taut controlled ride with a healthy amount of athletic sporty handling. Meaning, there�s a high level of driving confidence, comfort and that fun to drive factor. When, my ship comes in; a Lexus would be at the top of my luxury performance car-shopping list. As with other Lexus models, when I hit the gas, I felt a solid steady almost zippy acceleration. This latest version of the ES 300 would feel quite nice on a long drive on I-95 or taking the twisty scenic country roads upstate. Not to keep harping on my disdain for this vehicle�s styling but the rounded lines and sloped trunk impair reward visibility. This 5� 6� driver had trouble making out the rear end without total reliance on the driver�s outboard rearview mirror. A slight inconvenience for parallel parking on the congested city streets of Baltimore. As mentioned, this model shares many components, interior layout and design of its sister the Toyota Camry, which also was completely redone for model year 2002. Ironically the Camry's design and lines look Mercedes like to me. The ES 300�s dash is highly practical well-laid out like the less elaborate Camry. However, I know, this is the higher rent neighborhood on wheels. Power, technological gee gaws and Lexus excellent but easy to see and use automatic climate control are all present and accounted for. Front seat comfort felt excellent. Since the leggy executive stood a statuesque 5� 10� I had to readjust the seat. However, adjustment was quick and easy. I was quickly able to restore the ES 300�s supple leather seat back to its original position in a quick manner. I would have little trouble enjoying a long and fruitful driving relationship with this Lexus driving environment. Fit and finish are superlative like other cars from this flagship of the Toyota family. It is ashamed that at least in this writer�s opinion this vehicle is a visual failure. True, your typical Lexus owner buys this make for its outstanding quality but lets face it well heeled or not, looks weigh heavily when deciding what car to buy. Lets hope this abysmal design is short lived and the next generation restores this entry level Lexus back to its classic and clean lines. Since the ES 300 is based on the Camry platform, I highly recommend bypassing the status and buying either the luxury or better yet the sporty version of the Toyota Camry. The Toyota Avalon is also an excellent choice. At least Toyota abandoned the Ford Taurus oval madness and jellybean bulbous design of its previous generation Avalon.
