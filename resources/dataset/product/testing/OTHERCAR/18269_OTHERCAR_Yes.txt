            This is my second Jeep, the first being a 79&#146 CJ-7 which I have been driving for 17 years, has 120K miles on it and has never, I say again, NEVER had a major mechanical breakdown including engine, transmission or transfer case. So, with this experience, it was only logical to invest in another Jeep, in this case a 2001 Cherokee Sport, but finding one was the hitch in this ride. Since 2001 was the last year for the Cherokee Classic, we will lament it&#146s passing, the market is heavy with the lumpy, fashionable, Nuevo Grand Cherokees. For a real Jeeper these are not acceptable and fit only for Soccer Moms or trendy yuppies attempting to impress their neighbors. But find one I did.
In the two weeks I have had my Cherokee I have become enamored with her. The 4.0 L inline 6-cylinder engine has plenty of power and will fling this vehicle wherever you intend to go. It does not guzzle gas like a V-8 (see CJ-7 above) and my mileage so far has averaged 21 mpg. Styling is classic Jeep, boxy but no nonsense with a cavernous cargo area for it&#146s small exterior size. Mine came with an after market rubber mat with raised sides protecting the carpet in the cargo area, I suggest to invest in one, and Jeep supplies tie-downs on the deck and overhead for securing your bulky cargo. The standard equipment accursed doughnut spare (geez I hate those little toy tires) is mounted in the cargo area, and while some may consider this a shortcoming I consider it a bonus because it saves me from crawling underneath the vehicle in hot, wet or muddy conditions to retrieve the spare. Interior cabin space is another matter, the cockpit is a might cramped, though comfortable, when compared to the CJ&#146s or other SUVs and could use some loosening up. Taller or large persons may have to articulate a bit to get into the cabin, but this is a small penalty I am willing to suffer when compared to the pros. Handling is, what I would consider, remarkable for a full sized SUV, hugging the curves and never giving the impression of wanting to capsize. But then again, my view may be jaded since I have been driving a CJ wearing 31&#148 Thornbirds for 17 years, decide for yourself.  Interior design is rather bland, antiquated and, over all, not very impressive but we buy these vehicles for there versatility and 4WD capabilities not for there creature comforts. Cabin and wind noise can be a problem at highway speeds, that is if you wish to talk to someone without reading their lips, and this is with street tires. The Command-Trac transfer case includes 2WD high, 4WD high and 4WD low and allows for shifting from 2WDH to 4WDH part time, on the fly which is a Godsend for those of us used to manual hubs and the four-speed transmission is quite smooth and responsive. Last but not least, the Cherokee Classic is affordable in comparison to other full size SUVs. I can&#146t wait to get it on the trail for the first time and put her through her paces.
