            I must tell you that I bought the Beetle for my wife at first thinking that the car was too cute for me but after the shock of the bubble i was sitting in and the dash that goes on and on and on I pressed the petal of this Beetle priced at ~$18,500, plus tax, and was surprised at the impressive acceleration.  The best way to describe the driving excitement of swerving in and out of traffic in the New Beetle is to think back when you had finally grown up enough to get on the fast go-carts.  Tight sterring, very responsive, quick acceleration, and very tight handling.  One thing...I have had the DAMN WINDOW SWITCH go out on me a few times and all the service could do is replace it.  BTW speaking of problems I did have one more, when I bought the car there was a screw that kept getting jammed in the shift plate and the service said that it was because a lazy worker in Mexico didn't want dork waste his time trying to find the screw he lost.<br><br>
