            My experience with the VW Passat (as a dedicated Audi driver) was pleasant but not pleasing.

The car has an excellent powerplant, a 2.8 liter 30-valve V6.  That's right, 5 valves per cylinder, one of the most advanced engines on the road.  It's ~190 hp and the car is very quick and nimble.  It is quite lightweight for a car of its size and so, handles fairly well.

The seats were a little soft for me but I'm pretty picky on seats.  They were made of quality black leather.  This is the GLX model I speak of, the top-of-the-line in the Passat series.  The interior had burl wood and leather but seemed a little gaudy, the leather was shiny and the burl was too glossy to really be a luxury.  I think that going with semi-gloss would have made a lot of difference in my opinion of the interior.  The interior is well made, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't my taste.

This model had traction control with a switch to disable it, nice for those of use who prefer more direcet control.  The traction control did perform well when pushed to the limits.  ABS also performed well.

Front wheel drive is much easier to drive in slippery conditions and that is a definite plus about Volkswagens in general.

The place I became appalled at the Passat's performance was in the "fun-to-drive" category.  There is NO, absolutely NO feedback from the steering wheel, nor is there any resistance.  Just turn the wheel, almost as if it were loose and floating on the steering column.  This is very un-nerving if you are out of control or are driving quickly.
The brake and gas pedals also have no feedback and hardly any resistance, another detractor from the "fun-to-drive" category.

The transmission is a five speed automatic with Tiptronic, the latest combination of auto and manual.  While it works well, it is more of a pain than a stick. I miss my clutch when I'm driving that car.  The automatic works well enough that the Tiptronic isn't necessary.  Of course, it's not available without Tiptronic, nor is the V6 available with a 5 speed manual.

The car is fast and is well made, no problems to report in reliability.  It has more body roll than I'd like when cornering.  One upgrade this car could use is bigger wheels (16") and wider tires, maybe 205/55r16 rather than 195/65r15.

Trunk space is more than adequate and the seats will fit 4 comfortably.
This car is not for me!
