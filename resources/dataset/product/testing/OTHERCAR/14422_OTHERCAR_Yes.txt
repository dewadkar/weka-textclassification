            About 2 years ago one of my buddies bought a black '97 Dakota Sport. It had the 5.2L, 4x4, and the extended cab...and I immediately fell in love with it. So much so that I just recently bought it off of him. What attracted me the most to the new Dakota's was the new styling. Classified as a compact truck, the Dakota should be in a class all its own as the only mid-size truck on the market. As a avid fan of big horsepower engines, the 5.2L V8 is more than adequate. The extended cab gives you the option of carting around a couple of very small people. And the shift on the fly 4 wheel drive can help get you where you want to go.

The only thing I can think of that I don't like about the the Dakota is as I mentioned the not so roomy back seat, but since I own the truck I don't plan on spending a lot of time riding in the back seat. :)

As trucks go one would think that the ride wouldn't be as smooth as cars, but in this case I think that the Dakota out performs many cars in this instance. Its wide wheel base helps it negotiate corners at high speeds and it purrs like a kitten cruising down the highway at 85 mph.

This definitely isn't a truck for old ladies...this is more like the truck to use to run old ladies off the road. I don't think I'd recommend this truck to someone shopping for a family vehicle. You'd probably be better off with a full-size truck or a mini van. But I would recommend the Dakota to anyone looking to own a mean looking piece of machinery.<br><br>
