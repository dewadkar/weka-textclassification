            European cars, in America, have always been regarded as luxurious alternatives to the cheaper local and Japanese brands, and if what you are looking for is a vehicle for &quot;self-expression&quot; without giving away any off-roading ability then this is the car for you.

There is a saying in Germany, &quot;if you are going to buy a British car, then don't forget hire your personal Mechanic!&quot; One would have thought after the recent acquisition of the Rover group by BMW, that some of the German reliability and quality would have &quot;brushed-off.&quot;  Unfortunately this does not seem to be the case. 

Driving the car, off and on-road, one gets the feeling of a very powerful and competent SUV, but surely for the $60,000 price tag one seeks for something more than just short-term off-roading fun.
Listing out all the quality issues of this vehicle is beyond the scope of this review. 
Let's just say that at 70-80 MPH, your rear-view mirrors are anything but steady!<br><br>
