            My Lexus by far is the best car I have ever had the pleasure of driving and owning.

I started looking at Pre-Luxury cars because I wanted something that had status and an excellent history of reliability and comfort.  I test drove the 2000 Infiniti I30, Audi A4, Mercedes E320, and looked at the Acura 3.2TL.  None of these cars could compare with the Plushness of the interior AND the ride of the ES.  It is literally like you are riding on air....and my ES300 is a '96 model!!!!!

I highly recommend others to wait and find a Lexus model that is not of the basic color that most get.  (Black, Oyster, White, Tan/Gold)  Your car, even if it's older will stand out because it is different from what everyone normally sees.  My car is Amythyst...the Ruby Red is incredible.

I REALLY appreciate all who submitted their E-opinions here.  I literally read every single one of them before purchasing my car.  Your enthusiasm was totally contagious...and I will now begin a LONG relationship with Lexus.

FYI - For those that are looking to start out:

There is nothing wrong with buying an older Lexus.  These cars are incredible.  There are MANY new cars in my parking garage, but my '96 TOTALLY out classes them because it is a Lexus (slight pretentious grin) and because the body, paint, and the interior is in Like-New condition! (Believe it or not, the Leather and Cushiness of the older Lexus is better than in the 97' and up models!)

I will keep mine for two years and then upgrade to a 2000 Platinum Model.

Happy Driving!!<br><br>
