            The Malibu of yesteryear was a descendant of the Chevelle.  The cars had a little flash, a lotta go, and would get the groceries home too.  The Malibu of Y2K doesn't quite fill those shoes, except for the grocery part.  I had the opportunity to spend a couple of weeks with a rental, and it just didn't have the soul of the sedans of yore.

I guess the new Malibu performs the requisite chores fairly well, it starts when you turn the key, and the windows go up and down, but there is nothing to set your soul afire with this car.  The car I had was far from the top of the line, but even still one could tell this car was intended to be utilitarian.  The dash was formed out of really cheesy looking plastic, with a wood grain strip with a print that looked like a drink was spewed on it and allowed to mold.  The seats could really have used some more padding, and if the car was being billed as a family car, then where in heck are all the cup holders?  It seems like a car isn't worth 2 cents nowadays without 10 cup holders and only 5 seatbelts.

The engine did in fact move the car.  &quot;That is all I have to say about that&quot;.  Forrest Gump

Like I said, this car was not the top of the line, but I would have expected just a little sound deadening material in the carpet and doors.  This car at 60 MPH effectively drowned out any conversation.  So we went 80 MPH.

Bottom Line:  If you need a simple 5 seater, you will definitely want to look around a little.  By the way, I am a self professed Chevy Lover.<br><br>
