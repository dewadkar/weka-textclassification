            I purchased my 1996 Chrysler Concorde LX new. The styling, features, and price attracted me, and I liked the fact that the car was available in several configurations rather than just &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;loaded.&quot; Thus, I went for a mid-range model with the options I needed, but little in the way of extra-cost equipment. 1996 was the last year for the 3.3 V6, which my car has. The engine is adequate for most driving situations, however, in some areas it comes up short. First, it is underpowered in some respects. Merging into traffic can be tedious because the engine winds to its redline and quickly kicks into a higher gear losing momentum. Steep hills can be taxing for it as well. And then there is the noise factor - on hard acceleration, the 3.3 sounds very similar to a motorcycle! It positively growls.

Comfort is good. My car has a split bench seat and column gear shift which provides room for six passengers, although five are more comfortable. 

Fit and finish have been spotty. The paint is thin in some areas and the interior trim is beginning to show gaps on the dashboard. The car is tight and rattle free. A radio speaker is beginning to go out, and the headlights have had a switch problem since the day I bought it: sometimes they turn off and sometimes they don't. I often have to jiggle the switch to get them to shut off. 

Mechanically, the car has been very reliable and I have no complaints. Overall, I've been pleased and I would recommend a '96 Concorde to anyone in the market for a used car.<br><br>
