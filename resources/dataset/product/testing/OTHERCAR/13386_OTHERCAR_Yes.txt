            I currently own a 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier.  I bought this car based on the good performance of my first Cavalier.  I found the car to ride very smooth and easy to handle on the test drive.  I have a 4 door model which I find to give more room in the car compared to the 2 door model that I had first purchased. For a car that is 6 years old, there is little to no rust showing.   I am very glad however, that I purchased the extended warrantee because in both cars, I needed to have the head gasket replaced before the mileage reached 50,000 miles.  The warrantee covered the service work performed on my car in full.  I depend on my car to the highest degree and found the service department where I purchased my car to be outstanding.  This is one of the reasons that I will be returning to purchase another Chevrolet Cavalier within the next few months.  If you seek a pretty dependable vehicle that is priced to afford and handles well in snow, this could be a car to take out for a test ride.<br><br>
