            I have been using this camera for about 8 months now and love it.  I use it for both business and personal use.  Several other people in my office also had Sony digital cameras, but they were the type that use the disk.  While that is convenient, to me those cameras were just too big.  I love the size of the Cyber-shot.  I can put it in my pocketbook, briefcase or the glove compartment of the car with ease.  

The pictures are incredibly clear.  When I was looking at digital cameras, the store I went to showed photos that had been printed all on the same printer on the same type of paper.  That was very helpful because often the printer or paper can make a big difference.  Then they also had an enlarged area of the photo.  The DSC-F55 was much better than some of the other more expensive models.

Another feature that I like is when you download the photos from the memory stick to your disk, you can name the photo what it actually is.  When co-workers bring in disks from their cameras, you don't know what the photos are because they are numbered.

I would highly recommend this camera.  It is convenient, reasonably priced (for a digital!) and takes great photos.<br><br>
