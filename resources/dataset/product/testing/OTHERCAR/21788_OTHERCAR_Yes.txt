            Review of the 1997 Honda Civic 2 Door Coupe.

I purchased this car new in May of 1997. It has given me 60,000 miles of trouble free, happy motoring. The only non-maintenance work that has been done on this car was in the first month when I discovered the A/C was not putting out enough cold air. A must in sultry Northern Alabama. It was diagnosed as low refrigerant and was covered under the original warranty.
Since then only oil and other routine check ups have been performed. I changed the front brake pads at 55,000 miles and plan on replacing the rear ones at 65,000 or whenever they need it.

I have only praise for the design, engineering and workmanship of this car. Its only faults would not be noticed by the average owner or driver. My mother and father were so impressed with this vehicle that they ultimately purchased a Honda Accord as their retirement car.
I do have one complaint. 

During the design of this series of Civic, debuting in 1996. Honda apparently decided that the average Civic owner had matured a bit so the car is less sporty in its handling. It was put on 14 in wheels and given a less taut suspension. The result is a softer ride over bumpy city streets at moderate speeds. This is apparently the environment that Honda thinks this car will spend the majority of its time in. There is some roll in curves and lane changes. After replacing the factory issued P rated Dunlop's with T rated Michelin's the handling improved and the car feels safer.
On the highway even with the new tires the car is buffeted when following large trucks. This never occurred in the 1988 CRX  I previously owned. I believe that this design was optimized for a 4 door car with auto-transmission. A friend owns a 1995 4 door DX with auto trannie and I have ridden many miles in it. In my opinion it rides and handles much better. We have the same brand and model of tires so I feel that this a fair comparison. 

In conclusion I would most certainly say that this is a very good car and I would happily purchase another but only after spending  a little more time on the road to see if the above mentioned design idiosyncrasies have been corrected.
