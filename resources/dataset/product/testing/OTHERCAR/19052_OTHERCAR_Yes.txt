            I've been waiting for years to buy an EOS Rebel from Canon, but now there's digital.  A friend of mine recommended this camera, and it is fantastic.  Easy to use.  Good software that's quick and easy to load on a PC.  Great screen on the camera to review pictures.  It's really cool how you can zoom in on a digital photo.  I never thought I'd pay about $900 for a camera, but it's worth it to photograph my kids before they're grown and gone.  I've been using the camera for over a month and not had a single problem.

I recommend this camera to anyone - and for a great price, go to http://www.cameraworld.com.<br><br>
