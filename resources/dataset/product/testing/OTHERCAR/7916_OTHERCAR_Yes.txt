            I use the Power Shot A20 at work.  I've dropped it, sat on it, and even spilled coffee on it, and it still works like new.  The Power Shot is small enough to fit in your pocket, making it very convenient for work or play.  It also has some really cool features, like a panoramic setting, and a super easy to use zoom lens.

To make the A20 even more convenient, I purchased the rechargeable battery kit as well as a flash card adapter for my laptop.  Battery life is pretty good, but I do recommend spending a little extra for a rechargeable battery pack.  This Will save you big bucks in the long run.  Also, too make the battery last even longer, take it out of the camera when you're not using it.  It seems that the camera drains a small amount of power even when it's off.
