            With a top speed of over 170 mph, 0 - 60 in around four seconds and the luxury of it's plush interior, the 2001 Corvette Z06 is a dream car, in every sense of the word!

If you can afford high monthly payments on this beauty, go for it!! Trade in that family car, and go for broke! Or why make payments, if you can, pay cash!

You can get this beauty for around $45,000.00 (less if you have a good trade in). 

Mike Neal, Corvette Ride and Handling Engineer says:

"Having the best of both worlds---reduced weight and increased power---the Corvette Z06 will be a force to be reckoned with, on or off the track. When you think about how fast we were with the C5 over the C4 and how much faster the Z06 is than the C5, it's obvious that this isn't just a little tweak."

This 2001 American Icon sports a LS1 V8 engine, 350 hp and four wheel independent suspension. It also features Active Handling, to prevent oversteering. Drives and looks like a dream....

You get standard interior features to boot! Leather seating in your choice of Torch Red, Light Gray, Black/Torch Red, Light Oak, or the classic All Black! (My personal choice!!)

Exterior color choices are Torch Red, Navy Blue Metallic, Quicksilver Metallic (My Favorite!), Black, Dark Bowling Green Metallic, Millennium Yellow, Magnetic Red Metallic, Light Pewter Metallic and Speedway White!!! Can't you just see yourself driving up the coast for a weekend away from the hussle of the rat race? Just plug in some tunes and go!

Ever since the late 60's when I first rode (as a passenger) in a 63" Sting Ray, I've been in love with sports cars. This 2001 Corvette Z06 is by far the ideal sports car for today!
