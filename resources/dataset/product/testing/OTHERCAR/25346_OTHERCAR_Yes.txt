            The 1991 was the last year that the 560 SEC was made.
We've had ours for about 8 years and it has been a real
pleasure.  Anyone looking for a great handling car that
gives a pleasant quiet ride, wrapped in beautiful leather,
should try to find one of these German jewels!
The V8 has good acceleration and the brakes are strong
and do an excellent job.  As a former race driver I appreciate the engineering that went into this car.  Our
car, with 127,000 miles on the odometer, still feels like
a fresh new car.  I highly recommend this model.
