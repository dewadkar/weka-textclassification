            If you can find a camera with more features with better resolution for anywhere near this price, then you should buy it, otherwise, the 707 is for you.  Unless you want to get into the pro-slr category and spend a few thousand, then this camera will do everything you need it to.  THe resolution is simply amazing!  This camera will produce pictures that can be printed almost as large as you want.  I printed a 12X18 picture, and you couldn't even see any pixels.  Besides the great quality, this camera has all the options the more advanced user will want.  You can adjust the shutter speed, the aperature, or both at the same time.  One very useful feature is the noise reduction. Older cameras could take long shutter speed pictures, but they would be very grainy.  With the 707 you can take a multi-second picture, and it will be clear as anything, I was very impressed.  There are also some new features that no other camera has, like the night shot, and night framing.  These modes allow you to take pictures in complete darkness.  Night shot is just like what is on the sony camcorders, so the pictures come out looking night-vision green.  Night framing allows the camera to look into a pitch black area, use the infra-red sensors to determine the light needed, and then use the flash to make it look like daytime.  Many older digi-cams have a lot of trouble with low light situations, but this camera really shines(literally).  I was jaded by the zoom on my previous camera, an Olympus c2100 with 10x, but the zoom here is still great at 5x.  That is a 190mm equivilant.  Although you might think the camera is bulky, it sits in your hands very naturally, and the butttons are easy to use.  Another great feature that sony has is the ability to rotate the body of the camera.  This makes it much easier to take pictures low to the ground, and while using a tripod.  There is also an electronic viewfinder that is really top notch compared with the evf from the Olympus.  There are almost too many great things to say about this camera....I could go on forever.  I would definitly recommend this camera to anyone who loves to be in control of the pictures they take, you won't regret it.
