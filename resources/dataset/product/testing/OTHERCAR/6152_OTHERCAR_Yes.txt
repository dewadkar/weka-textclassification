            After having had many bad experiences with American-manufactured cars, I decided to take a chance on the Chevy Impala 2000 upon some recommendations. I have had the car for one year and have driven it for a little over 10,000 miles.  It is a good, solid, reliable car and the engine has not given me any problems. There is easy access to the trunk from the back seat. The back seat can be folded down to get to the trunk. Interior and exterior style is impressive. Now, for some minor cosmetic defects. The dashboard is so big and wide that you cannot reach the front of the windshield to put the county and state inspection sticker on. When you press down on the emergency brake, you hit the speaker on the left side. When you press the button inside the car to open the trunk, the trunk just unlocks, it doesn't open (always sticks). There is no convenient handle to open the trunk (really annoying aspect). The ride could be more comfortable - shocks need improvement.
Despite some minor cosmetic problems, I would recommend this car if you are looking for a solid, reliable car.
