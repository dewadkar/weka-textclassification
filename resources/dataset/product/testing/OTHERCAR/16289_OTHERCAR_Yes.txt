            I have written previously about my bad experiences with a Hewlett Packard computer (multiple failures right out of warranty), a printer (worked terrible), and a scanner (worked worse). In all fairness, now that I have come across an HP product that works well, I need to tell people about it.

I have had this camera for a little more than six months now and I love it. First, I'll expound the virtues of digital in general. Prior to purchasing this camera I had a Pentax ME Super that I had used for years and that had served me well. What would I do when I got pictures back from being developed though? Scan them into my computer. It's a lot easier to present them as a slide show or browse them on the computer than it is to fumble through an album, at least for me. That being the case, a digital camera was the way to go for me and I had wanted one for some time.

It's great not to have to buy film anymore, and better not to have to develop it. It's great not to waste precious moments when something goes wrong with your film. It's great to be able to load the images directly into my computer at home or laptop on the road and e-mail them to friends and family, or post them on my website. It's really great to be able to take pictures of items I want to sell on Ebay and have that image immediately and at no cost.

These are all reasons to buy a digital camera, but why this HP? Here are the reasons I like it. It's easy to use, point and click for the most part. The 1 megapixel image quality has been adequate for my needs, the photos come out crisp and clear most of the time. The camera comes with an 8MB memory card that can hold up 20, 40, or 80 pictures depending on the resolution you select. I usually stick with the middle setting and get great pictures every time. The memory card is removeable so that you can fill it and exchange with another card to take more pictures. 

The LCD monitor on the back allows you to check your pictures after you take them, you can display them all as thumbnails and delete those that didn't come out as you like them. There's a zoom feature and exposure settings, however the one bad point about this camera is that it seems to need quite a bit of light. Battery consumption is about average for such a device, I use rechargeables with it though so it' not really a problem. 

The software allows you to edit the photos and display them. Transfer is by USB cable, the rate is a little slow but that is a function of the input method rather than the camera. This is a great camera for the price. I recommend it highly.
