            If you're looking for an inexpensive point-and-shoot digital camera with midrange image quality you've come to the right camera.  It comes with a smartmedia 2M memory card; you can inexpensively upgrade this to 8M or 16M... I went for 16M but in retrospect 8M may have been enough.

Best for daylight photos, this camera is good for 50+ photos on 2 AA rechargable NiMH batteries so long as you don't use the flash.  Using flash will cut your battery life down to 8-12 pictures, after which you'll still be able to take a good number of non-flash photos.

If you do pick this up I highly recommend getting 4 AA NiMH rechargable batteries, 2 in the camera and a pair to spare.  Even if you use disposable Alkaline (so long as you avoid the flash) this is an extremely inexpensive camera to operate since theres no LCD to drain the batteries.  Since this is only 2 AA's rather than the more usual 4, I rated the battery life higher.  Also note that tthis makes it much lighter than most, as much of a digital cameras weight is the batteries.

This camera is not TTL (through the lens), so some images (especially close-up) will not be framed the way you intended.  This isn't too hard to get used to but will occasionally disappoint.
