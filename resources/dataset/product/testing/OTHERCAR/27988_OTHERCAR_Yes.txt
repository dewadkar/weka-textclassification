            This is an absolute fantastic car.  I have owned a 1999 Audi A6 Quattro for about a year and a half.  I still love driving this car every day.  I pass by all of the BMW's, Mercedes, and Volvos thinking &quot;you don't know what your missing&quot;.  This car has timeless styling that will still look good 10 years from now.  Audi has the most elegant and beautiful interiors that I have ever seen on any car regardless of price.  

When my wife, said she wanted a new car, i told her to go around and pick out any car you like and we'll go look at it.  AUDI never crossed my mind. After all she was driving a 1996 Ford Probe.  I thought that she would get something more luxurious, but never dreamed she would pick a $40,000 car.  
I amused her and went to the dealership.  I have never been so pampered in my life, especially at a car dealership.  We ended up leasing the A6 for about $510 a month for 3 years.   This wasn't that bad for what you get.  The great thing about Audi is that the only thing you pay for is gas.  All maintenance, oil changes, wipers, fluids  etc. are all include for the full three year warranty period.  This can really save you some money and make it a good value. I tested the program out the first scheduled service visit.  They did the usual oil change, wiper blades and stuff, then they gave us another Audi to drive while the car was being serviced.  When we picked up the car, it had been washed and vacuumed.  I was was informed by the service manager that it is all part of the &quot;Audi Experience&quot;.

I love everything about this car.  The All wheel drive Quattro will take you anywhere you want to go.  We just had 8 inched of snow and Ice and this car went everywhere. I had to pick up about six employees for work because they couldn't make it.  Three of them had SUV'S, and another had a BMW 740i.  Even the BMW owner commented on the quality of car and how nice the interior was and how well it handled and preformed.  His car was about $20,000-$30000 more than mine.  

I absolutely Love this car.  All you have to do is test drive one. If your reading this, you've probably already driven one and loved it.  Consider this some major positive reinforcement.  Why do you think Audi's sales have doubled in the last few years. They are making great cars.  Just look at their line (A4, A6, A8 and TT coupe.)  All are leaders in their respective categories and people are taking notice.  Don't be scared of the price.  It's worth it!
