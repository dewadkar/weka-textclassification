            Driving a Grand Laredo is the best way to ensure comfort and versatility, while maintaining a reasonable level of prestige. Take my jeep for example: It's a smooth ride in an understated design with a nice grill that says,&quot;The guy driving that car must be a success because he drives a car that is both dignified and useful.&quot; Have you ever checked out the space in the aft section? I also enjoy the overhead lights and computer that reveals the following practical driving data: miles per gallon; trip miles; compass direction; and maintenance intervals.

Some SUVs cost twice what my Grand Cherokee cost. However, some of those much higher-priced models actually lack some of the Jeep basics that make for a better ride. Finally, I enjoy the Jeep leather package as it is generally more masculine than some of the smooth, girly leather packages that are almost cold to the touch!

P.S. When a Cherokee ages, it gets better because the engine is basic and I have learned that most Cherokee owners do not hesitate to pass on their older jeeps to their children because it's such a &quot;cool&quot; auto!<br><br>
