            I purchased this camera in November of 1999 and it was the best purchase I ever made.  I had always wanted a digital camera, and now that I have one, I don't know how I ever did without it.

It is so easy to work, no problem what so ever.  You slide the cover in the front and start making memories!!

I was so happy to find out that it was not just easy to operate, but as easy to install the program and download the pictures.  It took me no more then 10 minuets from start to finish and I was on my way to printing my pictures.

One of the reason this is so precious to me is because I can send pictures so easy through email and the family is thrilled!!  Before I would take them but would never take them to get processed.  If I had 2 or 3 rolls to process, it got expense.

The only cons concerning the PDC-640 is that it does not have a disk to download on and that limits how many pictures you can take and that it really eats up batteries.  In my opinion though, those are very minor, enjoy!<br><br>
