               I bought my 1995 Mazda Millenia S used in 1998.  I was impressed by the fact that everything was factory installed.  I felt at home when I sat in my comfortable  electronically controlled leather bucket reclining seats  both on the drivers side and passenger side.  The instruments were convenient and provided me with all the information I needed.  The tilt steering column remembered and adjusted to my setting each time I re-inserted the key.  A very quiet ride was inhanced by my factory installed Bose music system that included am fm cassette, and 6 CD changer in the trunk.  The 2.3 liter V6 Miller Cycle fuel injected &quot;supper charged&quot; engine quickly responded and I knew immediately, this was something special, I was in love!!!  The climate was simply controlled by setting the temperature with the turn of one button.  The moon roof was wonderful on warm summer nights and the sun was filtered during the day by tinted glass.  The response and handling were unmatched by any other auto I had driven and the front and rear ABS brakes made the vehicle a joy to drive.  16 inch tires made the ride smooth and comfortable and halogen driving lights were a welcome addition. The ride in the back seat was almost just as comfortable except a little more foot room would have been appreciated.    From outside the auto was impressive.  Aluminum alloy wheels, beautiful gold color and sleek styling turned heads again and again.  There was more than adequate trunk space, who could ask for more?
   My problem has been the expense of costly repairs and maintainence.  The car smoked on start up when I bought it, it still smokes.  The super charger has been replaced at a cost of more than $4000.  Every repair has required that the engine be disassembled to some point to allow for the repair.  The plastic radiator cracked and the water pump went bad to a tune of $989.  A major tune up was almost $800.  The heads were retorqued, an ignition pak installed, the engine top was removed to replace a $49.00 coolant pipe, and the rotors were replaced costing more than $1500. The car is currently in for possible replacement of leaking seals around the valves.  Both CV axles have been replaced.  
   The person who purchases the Millenia S must be able to spend endless amounts on repairs.  <br><br>
