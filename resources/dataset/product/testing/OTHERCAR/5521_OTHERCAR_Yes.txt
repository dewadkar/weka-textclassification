            The only good camera is the one you have with you. I currently use a Sony PC100 DV camera to take pictures, but the 1 megapixel lens is suited for web pictures only. And despite it's size, I rarely take it along except when I know I'll be shooting video. I've been reading about the the DSC-U20 for months and have been waiting for the price to dip below $200. Now I have a camera that goes with me all the time.

The camera is about the size of two packs of chewing gum. The fit and finish is clean and functional. Menus are easy to operate, although those with larger hands may find it difficult to manipulate the menu bar and selection buttons. Controls and presets are limited which is as it should be with a point and shoot. 128MB Memory Stick media can now be had for under $30, allowing over 200 images to be stored at maximum resolution. Although an optical zoom would have been handy, it's not a deal killer. This camera is for parties, vacation snaps, and club shots.
