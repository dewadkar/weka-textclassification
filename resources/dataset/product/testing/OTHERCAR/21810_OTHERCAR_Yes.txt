            My Father bought a 91 Chevy short bed 1500 about five years ago, and throughout those five years I have had considerable time behind its wheel. As far as I am concerned, it hold the classic chevy lines, which I find much more attractive then Ford or dodge, especially for its year.  If you have read my epinion on my 86 gmc pickup truck you will remember how I described it as a tank on wheels.  Well you can get that feeling from a 91 Chevy 1500, but it has several differences then my 86. It is also as reliable as my 86 gmc was, with NO break downs, and NO mechanical problems what so ever. 

First off, the 91 1500 is a large vehicle.  It takes up most of the lane and doesn't leave a lot of room for error on crowded narrow streets, but it more then makes up for it with the feeling of safety you get from being in something SO large.  When my dad purchased his truck, it had suspension changes made, so I honestly can't tell you what to expect from a stock 1500 as far as handling goes.  My dads truck doesn't Have too rough of a ride, but it also doesn't ride like a Cadillac.  You don't want to take it through corners like an indy car, but you can feel confident your not going to loose control.  The largest plus my dads 1500 had over my 86 gmc s-15 pickup is the horsepower.  The difference between a large V8 and my puny V6 is amazing.  You actually feel as if you can accelerate with traffic and get on the freeway at a safe speed.  It also has more then enough power to pull a trailer if you need to.  If your not careful the lack of weight will keep you spinning the tires if you put your foot in it at a light.  And with the stiff and heavy chassis you won't feel as if the trailer is pulling you around the road.    Belive it or not, it gets better gas mileage as well.  Its not the best mileage but it does better on gas then my 86 did.   

The few things I DON'T like about this vehicle are simple but they add up. First off, the paint is horrible.  Even with regular waxing the paint fades and peels off.  It is a common sight to see Chevy's with no paint on their hoods and roofs.  My second complaint is the interior of the truck. The bench seats are OK, nothing all that great, but the dash is this ugly square monster, which looks as awkward as it is to use.  With half the radio right next to the steering wheel, and the other half in the center of the dash it makes it different to control the stereo.  Nothing has a natural feeling to it, and it is not aesthetically pleasing.  Also like most American vehicles the interior isn't the best made.  The drivers door handle is falling off on the inside so it makes it difficult to close the door without ripping it out.  The plastic piece that locks the back window closed snapped and broke one day while the window was being closed.  

All in all it is a very good vehicle.  It has a positive feel on the road, and has more then enough power to get you around town, with the looks to do it in style.  There are a few problems that chevy could have fixed and have probably done so by now.  Its not my kind of vehicle, but ill drive it in a pinch to get me where I am going.  Happy driving.

All in all this is a good truck.  <br><br>
