            I bought my car new when I was finishing high school.  The price was right, and I figured it was worth the investment as long as it got me through college and a little bit beyond.  

I have been very happy about that purchase.  This is actually an updated review, since I recently experienced a rather significant problem with my poor little Cav (details below.)

Here is what I have had done to the car since I purchased it in April, 1995...

1. New head gasket...Cavaliers, Sunfires, and Saturns are notorious for this problem, which I recently learned.  Chevrolet claims they sent a special notice out to '95 / '96 Cavalier owners about this problem back in '99, so if it hasn't happened yet, take it to a Chevy dealership and have it looked at and repaired for free.  If you already had it done, Chevy may reimburse you for the repair, as they are going to do for mine.

2. New tires (in 1998...I think the tires it came with were actually not that great.)

3. Front brake rotors (Replaced in fall, 2000.  I have yet to do the back, since I still have some wear left in them.)

4. New battery (bought winter, 2000.)

5. New serpentine belt (replaced summer, 2001.)

6. Regular oil changes

I think that's pretty good for a seven year old car.  I also like the appearance, because the old Cavaliers are just nasty looking.  The models from 1995 to present are sporty without being obnoxious, and it's not as boxy as other cars from around this time period.

This isn't just a Cavalier love-fest, though.  I have a few concerns.  First, I hate the plastic bumpers...they dent pretty easily, and when you have a dent, it is REALLY obvious.  Second, the interior materials are cheap and not that well assembled.  I've had a few of the plastic pieces come off, but they're easy to put back again.  Finally, Cavaliers do pretty badly in crash tests.  I don't know exactly how that bodes for real-world accidents, so I'm just praying I don't get into a serious one!

All in all, I have been very happy with this car.  That's why I have been so surprised to read so many negative reviews about it.  The head gasket problem is really my only significant disappointment with this car, but Chevy seems to be standing behind the car, so I'll probably keep it for at least another year before going shopping again.
