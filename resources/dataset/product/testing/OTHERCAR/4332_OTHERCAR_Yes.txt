            Let me start this review by saying I am picky.

I looked at several SUVs before making my decision.  I did not like the Liberty Jeep because it reminded me of someone driving through the woods and I did not like the tire in the back.  The Sante Fe and Ford Escape did not have the audio controls on the steering wheel.

I bought the Kia Sorento with all the bells and whistles:  the luxury package, anti lock brakes, leveraging system, automatic climate control, leather seats, sunroof, etc.

I bought the Sorento after visiting every car lot on the universe.  Nothing compared to the Sorento because of it's price and features.

I have leather seats, a sunroof, 6 CD changer, alloy wheels, spoiler, tinted windows and HEATED SEATS!  All for under 25,000.  You can't beat that.  I considered buying a 1999 Lexus RX300 but decided to buy the Sorento because it was new with all the features that I wanted.

When I ride in the Sorento, it truly turns heads.  Last weekend I went into Hardees and this guy asked me if I liked my Sorento.  I told him I loved it.  He then walked up to it and looked inside.

I have beautiful tan leather seats and my seats have an 8 way adjust feature.

The cons follow:  I thought I had purchased a Sorento with a 6 CD changer in the dash,10 speakers and audio cassette.  I have the CD changer and 10 speakers except the audio cassette.  It was 11:00 at night when I finalized my vehicle purchase and did not realize it did not have the audio cassette until 2 weeks later.

Also it could be better when driving around curves.  Sometimes I feel like the Sorento is going to tip over when going fast around curves . . . but I think that is typical with most SUVs.

In summary, I highly recommend the Sorento.  It is rare I see them on the road and I get lingering stares when I drive it.

I love the luxury feel.  It feels good to drive it.  I highly recommend it.
