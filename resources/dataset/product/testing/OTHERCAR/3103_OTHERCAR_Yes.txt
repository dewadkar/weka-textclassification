            My husband still owns a 1991 Hyundai, and it has been virtually trouble free, so when the time came to purchase a new car for myself, I turned in my 1990 Nissan for the 2000 Elantra.  Its sleek lines and sharp-looking dashboard are a big step up from the car of 9 years ago. Power windows and door locks are a standard feature now. The engine is more powerful; the ride is incredibly smooth for a 4 cylinder car. The driver's seat has an adjustable lumbar support, and there is plenty of leg room. There are remote switches for the gas tank and trunk, a neat little cup holder that slides out under the radio to hold your coffee without spilling, a driver controlled door and window lock, and fold down rear seats to allow for more trunk storage when purchasing large items. Standard also are a stereo radio and cassette player. 

The car I purchased came with a factory installed alarm system and sun/moon roof. The moon roof could be a problem for tall people, as the ceiling is a bit lower because of it; my husband (6'4&quot;) has trouble sitting straight in the driver's seat. The alarm system failed to work on two separate occasions; a connector switch and control box had to be replaced. The front seat belts connect on the inside of the driver and passenger seat, close to the rear of the seat, which can be annoying if you have a coat on. The front windows, when opened, allow rain to drip directly onto the control buttons on the armrest. These were the only negative features I found on the car.

The 10 year 100,000 mile warranty at no extra charge is certainly an added incentive to buy this car. Hyundai has certainly come a long way!<br><br>
