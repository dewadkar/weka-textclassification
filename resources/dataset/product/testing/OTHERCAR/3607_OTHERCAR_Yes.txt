            The Envoy is marketed as a separate model. But it's essentially the flagship of the GMC mid-size Jimmy sport utility line, with a wood-and-leather interior and a wealth of upscale equipment including heated front seats, automatic climate control and elaborate sound system. It also has an advanced, standard AutoTrac full-time four wheel drive system. The light power steering should be more precise. And although the &quot;Premium Luxury Ride&quot; suspension generally delivers a comfortable ride, rough roads definitely let you know you're in a truck. Handling is good, although the Envoy leans noticeably at above-average speeds through curves. An anti-lock, all-disc-brake setup provides acceptable stopping power. The Envoy doesn't feel as slick or sophisticated as such newer rivals as the Mercedes-Benz M-Class or Lexus RX 300. But it has a lot to recommend it.
