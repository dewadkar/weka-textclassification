            Never before have I ever owned a brand new car.  I traded in a 1980 Jeep CJ-7 and put a couple of thousand down.  This car is absolutely incredible.

It's deep red in color, with gray velour seats.  Wood-grained dash trim and power everywhere.

Everything from the seats are automatic, including the driver and passenger mirrors.  Windows, Locks, and trunk.  The trunk is large enough for a months worth of groceries for a family of 5 and depending on how you load it, even more.  

Leg room is plentiful in both front seats and back.  Both driver and passenger front seats fully recline and are especially designed with the lower back in mind.  The driver side has a window lock feature, which when enabled, prevents passengers from opening the windows too far.

Cruise Control, Automatic headlight shutoff, Automatic dimmer switch.  These are just a few of the standard equipped options on this car.

Driving this vehicle?  Well, I would get home and park my business vehicle, get in the car, just to drive it.  All I would do is go around the block.  But I just had to drive it. It's so comfortable.  Pure Luxury, and never in a million years, did I think a car like this would be mine.
