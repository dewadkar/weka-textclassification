            I am still in love with it. The rotating 2.5" LCD is convenient & accurate for previewing pictures or showing movies. It makes it much easier to get a picture at knee height, or with out alerting your subject. 
I have been able to fit well over 30 images on one floppy disk & then delete them all! In one year I've used & reused only 15 or so floppies & you just can't beat that for convenience & economy. 
I have blown up images to 8x10 successfully without tremendous pixilation, & smaller sizes look indiscernable from film pictures. 
The zoom is exceptional at 14x & the macro is magnificent as well - it actually focuses in on the inside of our lens cap! 
Not to mention that when you pull this camera out of your bag people just "ooooh" & "aaaah". It's an all around fantastic camera & the only drawbacks are it's size & its resolution.

-I recently traded my fd91 for a cybershot camera with better resolution & what I have found is that yes, resolution was better BUT comparing the quality of light, zoom, & overall features this camera is by far the better camera.
