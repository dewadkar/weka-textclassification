            The VW Jetta is a car I fell in love with the moment I saw it.  I originally went to the dealer ship to just drool over it, figuring I would never be able to buy one.  I test drove one with a stick shift and leather seats - and it was all over!  They had a green one with a sunroof and leather interior and I knew that was my car!  They worked with me on price and I was pleasantly surprise at how low my lease payments would be!  

The car drives remarkable well; shifts amazingly smooth (I had never driven a manual before, and after a week felt like a pro!), and can take corners better than any car I have previously owned.  

You just couldn't buy a better car for the money.  The options are very easy, unlike with many American cars; even the base model is pretty loaded with auto windows, keyless entry, full spare, etc.  

As always, the trunk of the Jetta is bigger than you could imagine, and the back seats fold all the way down (when you remove the head rests) for a flat surface if you need it.  

The only fault I can find is that if I slide my seat all the way back, there is not much leg room in the back seat for adults.  But unless you are over 5'10&quot; with long legs, you will not need to put the seat back that far!  The seats are very comfortable, I have even taken this car on long trips and not had the aching feeling I have had in other cars.

The 'coolest' part of the car is simply at night ï¿½ your dashboard lights are BLUE!!! And pointers are RED!! It just makes you even FEEL cool driving it.
