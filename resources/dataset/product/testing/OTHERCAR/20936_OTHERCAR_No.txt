            Yes, after over 4 months wait, I got home at 8PM from my companies sister office in Irvine, CA and headed straight to Huffines, in Plano, Texas, where salesman Mike Krouse and my &quot;dream car&quot; awaited.  Upon arrival, I was taken over to it for a brief look and was told that we would go in and take care of all of the paperwork, then do a  look over on the car.  Something immediately caught my eye towards the bottom panel of the driver side from about 10 feet away.  Upon looking closely, there was black paint spots (I chose silver), some as big as a fingernail on the lower panel.

Mike said they missed it but would take care of it.  Mike told me it happens some times and they usually just sand down the spot or defects and repaint the area or whatever is needed to get it fixed.  It just happens before the customer gets it, so know one ever knows.  I don't know about you, but the reason I buy ANY new car is because I want manufactures paint, not dealer paint, as it's never the same.  The high pressure came on, and they were basically pulling me in, asking me to come in and complete the paperwork and they would take care of the paint problem for me (trust us).  Then I started noticing that the paint on the back hatch was unevenly coated (it was dark and you could see the paint levels under the bright dealer lights).  I also noticed that the silver logo was plastic (it looks like metal).  But I was really worried about the black paint problem.  We got into a pretty good argument about why the paint issue couldn't be taken care of BEFORE I completed the paperwork.  I was told that I should have trust and faith in &quot;Old Man Huffine&quot; He didn't even say &quot;Huffines&quot; which is the old man's last name.  Please!  I had requested additional window tinting to match the side windows.  The salesman told me he had to have one window redone, as it was defective.  The tint didn't match the shade of gray (and that was at night).  I noticed that there were some errors in the window tinting as well.  Lastly, although I don't know much about cars, the underneath structure appeared to be cheaply put together. 

Mike and the manager told me that I could not get the issue with the paint (which was the main problem for me) taken care of for a few days because of the holiday weekend, and there would be no one in the shop so it would take about a week, which was later reduced to 3 days.  Although I didn't question him, I found it hard to believe that Huffines in Plano didn't have a &quot;make ready&quot; guy available on a holiday weekend... WHEN PEOPLE BUY CARS ON HOLIDAY WEEKENDS, but I'll be fair and leave that one alone. (note:  Texas does have a 3 day return law for user protection on cars... I think it's three days).   The salesman told me that it would be hard to get a written note to fix it, but the manager might put it down, and kept assuring me that I could trust them to fix it.  Personally, I don't know many people who hand someone over $20,000 on a trust deal (and $14,000 of that was going to be cash).  I made this well known.  After a major ordeal, we got it put on the paperwork, but when I went into the business office, with the business manager, the contract said AS IS, and after questioning, the manager and Mike again showed up and told me that they would not put the required fixes on the &quot;legal&quot; paperwork.  I wanted the note to read &quot;Huffines must repair to customers satisfaction or sale is void.&quot;  I was not about to deal with a repainted car... if that's what it took to fix it, and I made that known as well.

I was disappointed, upset, confused... you name it.   Anything but positive.
I continued to be high pressured and after consulting some people (both in legal and friends) via my cell phone away from the salesman, to help me decide what to do, I was told that my &quot;...people didn't know anything about the car business&quot; by Mike Krouse.  I was then told that if I did not take immediate delivery of the vehicle that &quot;Chrysler had sent out a mandatory paper that any car would have to be raised an additional $2000&quot;.  WHERE DID THAT COME FROM!  I asked, almost in a laughingly pi**ed off state.  Although I was in Irvine when the car came in, Mike Krouse told me he would hold it until I came back and there was no problem.  Now all of a sudden, the hold time was 5 days and I was on day 4.  After arguments with both Mike and the manager, I was told that in fact, I did have another 24 hours to decide before they would raise the price on me.  Neither Mike or the manager could produce/ or would let me see this &quot;price increase paperwork&quot;.  They told me customers wouldn't be allowed to see it.  I explained it was funny because it wasn't on the Chrysler web site anywhere.  I was told it's new... and only for new orders.

I explained that I was taking the additional day, that regardless, I had by dealer law. and told the manager that I thought Mike was being a total a**hole with the pressure tactic and telling me my people were wrong after waiting over 4 months.  He apologized and said &quot;Mike's under a lot of pressure and he has to close on your deal tonight in order to get a bonus he's been working on.  Can't you just help him out?&quot;  I just smiled and said, &quot;I've got 24 hours, you've got 24 hours, and I'd recommend you have your tech come in from work, pay him overtime or whatever, in the morning and get my car ready for me, or (after the almost 2 hours of debate)... I said it... &quot;I'LL WALK !&quot;  Beginning early the next morning, in almost 30 minute intervals I was receiving voicemails on my cellular and my home answering machine.  After 4 messages within a couple of hours, and an almost full cellphone mailbox by the skillful salesman, I almost felt as if I was deliberately being hassled AT HOME!  Apparently, Mike is not smart enough to understand that leaving one message per (home and cell) voicemail is quite enough for me to understand clearly.  

The messages (all of them) were positive, saying variations of &quot;Mr. Kirby, we had our technician come in especially for you and they got the paint off your car with no problem.  You're car is fine and ready to go.  You need to hurry and get here because I can't hold it for you after today.&quot;  If he would have left one message, things could have been different.  But the continued calls that I let roll into the answering machine got me thinking.  I spent the morning thinking... and thinking.  Mainly about the horrible experience the night before, the pressure... terrible.  Then I started thinking about the quality aspects.  The salesman was only doing his job... pushing merchandise as fast as possible and any WAY possible... but what about the initial problems (minus the tint).  Being a professional in the business of computer and network support, I thought: &quot;Hey, let's check out the internet and see what they are saying.&quot;  

Thank GOD for the internet and people for their information.  I went to the unofficial PT site called www.ptcruizer.com.   Specifically to the repairs section which can be found at this address http://www.ptcruizer.com/repairs-pt-cruiser.html and some especially good user comments at their page http://www.ptcruizer.com/cgi-bin/ptech.pl as of October 2000.  I started seeing all kinds of bad stuff such as &quot;rear glass popping out and breaking due to stress and manufacture issues&quot;, leaky windshield wiper fluid devices that Chrysler is aware of, pieces of the engine that can mess up the hood, all kinds of internal and external noises, and even some comments about the plastic logos that I noticed saying that the silver comes off or even the logos and you can't use a car wash and be very careful with the peeling of the &quot;fake metal&quot;.  For me this was to be a nice car, and living in Dallas with a 45 minute morning commute it was to be a reliable car as well... not just a fun car, and yes, I realize it's not a $40,000 car.  But at least with the PT that came in for me... I became very unsure of it's quality.

The following day, after 4 months, a nightmare with the dealer, and then too many calls, I walked in to Huffines in Plano, Texas, asked for Mike Krouse, who came running over smiling... AND I ASKED FOR A REFUND ON MY DEPOSIT!  Explaining to both him and the manager that even if it were the perfect car, I could never get in it without thinking about the bad experience.  Mike walked away.  Came back shortly with a refund receipt to my credit card of the $500 I so excitedly put down four months previously, said &quot;Mr. Kirby, this was put back as a credit to your card.&quot;  laid it on the front counter... and walked away.  Strangely enough, I felt better, but sad... like leaving a badly suffering pet at the vet to be put to sleep.  I didn't even look for the PT which I'm guessing was still in the shop... it was not around where I could see it anyway as I walked away.

The sun came up the following morning and my wife and I drove around with my PC laptop in hand with all of the major car sites cached in it's memory.  Local rock radio station 97.1 &quot;The Eagle&quot; had a commercial for Toyota closeouts, so I thought what the heck...  By the end of the evening  I had found Texas Toyota in Grapevine Mills, Tx.  Wow, were they busy!!!   I was wearing a WWF shirt and had several of their busy staff take the time to come over and have friendly conversation. about the Sport/Entertainment.  I found this to be amazing, as you could tell everyone was very busy, and it was a major weekend promotion.  Although it's the cost of two PT Cruisers, I found my baby... a 2000 Toyota 4Runner Limited.  After hearing the story that you've just been subjected to, the sales and management staff cut the BS and gave me a straight up excellent deal.  No hassles throughout the entire process made the event very positive.  The sales manager and my salesman Ryan Osbourne, were EXCEPTIONAL took care of all of my requests, and did excellent follow-up afterwards.  Great guys.  And the 4Runner... OUTSTANDING.  

I had told both Mike and the manager at Huffines, and Toyota that I was going to share this story via the internet, but being busy at work, and home... and now happy with my new car, I had just put it down as a &quot;bad experience&quot; and went on.  Then a funny thing happened.  As with the start of my testimonial, I found my way on another business trip to the sister office in Irvine, CA.  As I drove my rental car down PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) to look at the Ocean, I came up next to a PT Cruiser.  It was silver, just like the one I ordered.  Yet, it and it's driver looked sad.  Keep in mind, this is California heat, but the silver paint was already starting to fade in the same areas on the back hatch where I had noticed it was uneven looking on mine.  Also, the &quot;Limited&quot; logo had started peeling off.  The luster was gone.  The lady driver looked unhappy as well... not to say &quot;about the car&quot;, but something about the whole scene or maybe the car itself was telling me to write my experience down and share it.  I'll close by saying &quot;You really do get what you pay for&quot;, and yes, I'm a very real person, Jeff Kirby, and can be reached on email at ampliflier@ev1.net.  Please don't send hate mail, but I'd love to see how far this message goes.

If you're a PT Cruiser owner... I can still say, &quot;I'm jealous&quot;, and I honestly hope your experience is nothing like mine.
Have a great life,
Jeff Kirby
