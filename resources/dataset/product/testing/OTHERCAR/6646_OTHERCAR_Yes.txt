            I have a 2001 Jetta GLX and love it.  The options that come with the GLX are definitely worth it for someone in their early 30's looking for a German engineered car without making another mortgage payment.  

The VR6 is more than adequite for zipping around town and a blast to drive on the highway, but I am beginning to wonder why Volkswagon hasn't introduced a 24 valve version of their VR6 engine.  174 HP is fine, but 200 plus would be better!  The premium gas requirement is a bit annoying, but gas prices are dropping (wishful thinking) so its not that bad.

The GLX package has some musts in my opinion.  Leather heated seats!!!! If you have had them you know what I am talking about, if not get them and you will know!  The self dimming mirror is so convenient and I find it quite useful, especially when a truck is behind you at night.  No need to flick the mirror back and forth.  The speed sensitive wipers are something that takes a bit of time to get used to, but once you do they actually come in handy.  There is nothing cooler than slowing down at a red light and watching your wipers slow down with you.  The rear sun visor is only handy if you have children, which I do so I do get some use out of it.

Some other great features are:
the sport suspension with the 17' wheels - I get many compliments on those!

Wood grain dash - I think it adds some refinement over a base Jetta.  On another note the GLX comes with a black dash which also cuts down on the glare.

The dash lights - what can I say neon blue on black...  I feel like I am flying a plane.

The Monsoon sound system - Great sound, 8 speakers and a subwoofer.

Trip Computer - Figures MPG and temp outside, its a nice bonus.

Climate control - another great feature that eliminates the need to constantly adjust knobs.

Sunroof - I am so glad they did away with the hand crank system.  The dial adjusts the roof to whatever level you want with one turn.

The one major problem I have had is the alarm wiring.  Apparently the dealer didn't install the factory in dash CD player correctly and 6 months after I purchased it the alarm would start going off for no reason.  The local dealer where I live quickly corrected the problem which turned out to be the CD player not being pushed in all the way.  The alarm wiring system runs through the CD player thus setting the alarm off.

Anyway I look at it for 23K NEW this car was worth it.  I have a "poor man's" Bimmer for 7k less than what I would have spent on 3 series.  I will definitely be getting another Jetta in a few years, but I hope they upgrade the engine to a 24 valve version.
