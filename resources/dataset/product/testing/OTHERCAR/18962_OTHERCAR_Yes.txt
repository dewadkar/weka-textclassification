            As I walked through the door of my local Lexus dealership, my eyes were immmediately drawn the the brand-new, crystal white, Lexus GS430 that was sitting in the showroom.  I had to drive this car, and after a long test drive, I came to the following conclusion, THIS IS ONE HELL OF A CAR!

EXTERIOR
First of all, the design of the GS is very attractive.  Lexus designed the car to very aggressive looking and they accomplished that w/ the GS's lean and smooth look.  I especially like the 4 headlight design, which furthers the cars aggressive design.  The GS430 I drove was equiped w/ huge 17inch wheels that were wrapped w/ Z rate tires.  This car was designed to go very fast.  

INTERIOR
Like all Lexus interiors, the GS does not dissapoint.  Soft leather trimed seats are as comfortable as your favorite LazyBoy recliner.  The instrument panel inluminates as the car is started.  It is a very clean design and is easy to read at quick glances.  Interior passenger room is abundant in both front and back.  Visiblity is also outstanding, with no dangerous blind spots to worry about.  Overall, a near pefect interior.  Also, the optional Mark Levinson audio system is one of the best I've ever heard.

ENGINE/RIDE
The GS430 is equiped with a 4.3 V8 that produces 300hp and 325lbs of tourque.  All those numbers equal to a 0-60 time of just under 6 seconds for the automatic equip GS430.  For those of you who are not into peformance, this is very fast for a large, luxury car like the GS.  All that power takes nothing away from the cars ride as it is typical Lexus smooth.  The GS also handles quite well considering its size and weight.  I just wish the GS430 could be equiped w/ the up and downshift steering wheel mounted buttons that the GS300 has.

VALUE
This car prices for around $55,000 fully loaded.  Not exactly cheap, but a good value considering the car you are getting in return.  I feel that the GS430 is one of the top production cars that is made today.  It combines great peformance, stunning looks, and everyday driving comfort into one package.  If you can afford this car, do not hestitate in buying one, I promise that you will not be dissapointed.
