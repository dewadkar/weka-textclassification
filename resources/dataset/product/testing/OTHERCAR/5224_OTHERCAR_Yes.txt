            I love this camera.  I have had it for about 8 months and I find that it takes GREAT pictures.

PROS:  The unit is small enough to fit in your jacket pocket, software is easy to use, the little LCD screen makes camera an ease to set-up, you can see your picture on the screen before uploading.

CONS:  The upload cable and the A/C adapter cable plug in very close to each other.

TIPS:  Buy the A/C adapter at the same time you buy the camera.  I searched for 3 weeks to find the adapter by itself.  Watch for this item on Ebay or Ubid.  I got mine for under $200.00 in the factory box with warranty!

I use this camera for all my Ebay items and for taking finer pictures of items for my sales job (day job).
