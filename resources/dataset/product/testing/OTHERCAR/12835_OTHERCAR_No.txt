            My wife and I test drove the Rav4 (also drove Saturn Vue) and generally liked it with one glaring exception...the interior is SMALL!
We placed our 2-year old in the back in his child seat and he was able to kick the back of the driver seat the entire test drive.
The rear cargo area is too small to be useful for anything other than the weekly grocery shopping (it failed the "dog kennel test" for us, measuring a mere 28" from rear seat back to the back hatch).
The front seats are comfortable, but you feel very close to the instrumentation panel. Overall, the Rav4 felt claustrophobic. Five adults is simply out of the question.
The 4 cylinder was plenty powerful (and I like V6's) and the ride was quite good, typical Toyota with very taut steering.
If you are single or married without children and like the styling (and have an excess of disposable income!) I guess the Rav4 fine. 
Yet, fully equipped your looking at $24k easily. At that price your getting close to the low end of the Toyota Highlander, a much larger and better equipped vehicle for the money (assuming you don't glom on all the unnecessary doo-dads).
While the quality and finish appears to be exceptional, it seems that the Rav4 is in a strange niche somewhere between the Matrix hatchback and the Highlander. Just not sure who this vehicle would appeal to, given it's price.
