            The BMW 318 is in the same class as the lowly Honda civic. The car runs as powerless as the civic, but the outer  parts are what drew me to this car. The body is nice and clean and the interior rivals any high end car in its class and above. The leather seats, nice sunroof, and awesome handles give this car a significant edge over its competitors, but the weak v4 along with the 1.8 liter engine with 120 torque and 130 hP makes driving this car a drag for those addicted to speed. Overall, buying this car used from the dealer is the way to go over buying a new one. At around $20,000, the 1999 BMW 318 is a worthy investment, especially if you want to impress the hot ladies who know nothing about cars, but know the luxury of a "Beamer."
