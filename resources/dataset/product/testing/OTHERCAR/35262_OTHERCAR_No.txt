            The wonder of the Cavalier is just how bad it is, considering that GM knows how to build good cars.

<B>Introduction</B>

I recently got stuck with a Cavalier rental car, and used it as an opportunity to test it out.  Let me start by saying that even though I'm a car nut, and generally prefer European cars, I came in without prejudice.  Just a few weeks earlier, I was astonished by the excellence of the Ford Focus.  I guess Ford is still far ahead of GM...

I used to own a Saturn, also by GM, and expected the Cavalier to be similar.  Both are similar in size, engine, features, and price, though the Cavalier's list price is a bit higher than the Saturn SL.

<B>Features</B>

The Cavalier is full of junky, blocky, out of place plastic.  The seats are flat and uncomfortable, and the steering wheel is the old thin-rim style often found in cars of two or three decades ago.  In fact, it turns out that much of the mechanical bits under the Cavalier's relatively pretty bodywork date from the 1960's and 1970's, so this should come as no surprise.

<B>Driving</B>

This car drives poorly.  It's not that it handles poorly (which it does) but that it just feels all wrong.  It accelerates slowly, the three-speed transmission is sluggish and shifts at all the wrong times, and the engine howls in protest at every hill.  It felt like a project car put together by a high school shop class.  Plus, it got poor mileage (under 30MPG) for the week I had it.  At first I thought it had been abused, but there were under 2000 miles on the odometer, and it was brand new.
