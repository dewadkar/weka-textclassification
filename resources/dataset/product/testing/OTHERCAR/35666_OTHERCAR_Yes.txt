            This is my 5th Honda Accord Coupe -- the first time I've bought an automatic and the V6.  My '98 EX (which was my favorite until now) felt more sporty with the 5-speed, but the V6 with 240 HP has more get and go...but I'm going to the gas station more often, getting about 19 mpg.
Going from an '89 DX, to a '92 LX, to a '95 EX, and then the '98 EX, getting in each one felt much like the previous one.  But this time Honda changed everything...power door lock and power window knobs, power mirror adjustments are different, as are wipers and lights...not huge changes, but enough to notice.  What is really noticeable is the extra quality touches...the trunk lid is lined underneath, and fender wheel wells are lined too making for a quieter ride.
The EX-V6 comes with leather interior (which I never had before either) and I'm enjoying that as well, the seats have separate 2 level heaters for driver and front passenger.  I've had this car since October, so I'm not sure if I'll be fond of the black leather when it gets hot out.  The climate control also has separate thermostats for driver and passenger.  And the driver seat has great lumbar support, and quite a few power adjustments.  And the driver side mat hooks in so it's not always moving around on you.
The in-dash 6 CD changer sounds great, and having controls on the steering wheel to change modes (from AM, to 2 FM tiers, to CD), change stations or CD tracks, and raise or lower volume is a great feature.  Another great feature is Honda's Homelink, you can program it to operate your garage door opener.
Moon Roofs are standard on EX's, and this one seems to operate quieter than the ones in the past.  I did not get the moon roof visor this time, as it is rather large (and I think ugly!).  I always get the rear wing spoiler which I think looks great and adds a sporty touch.
The only thing I'm having trouble with is turning corners -- because the windshield slopes so much, and the window post is much wider (because it holds a side curtain airbag) that it blocks my view when turning left.  I'm not sure if this is because I sit up close (I'm short, but do not put my seat all the way up).  I thought I would have adapted better to this by now, but still find myself leaning forward when turning to look at where I'm going!
