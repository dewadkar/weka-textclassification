                The Insight is the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle to be sold in the United States.  The Insight gets about 70 miles to a gallon.  The engine is a very small 1.0-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine.  The engine is made of lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium and special plastics.  Somewhere in the process when the engine is running, it will switch from gasoline to electric power.  The Insight's eye-catching body style includes rear fender skirts which help the air to smoothly glide past the rear wheel wells.  
     Getting in and out of the Insight is a struggle but once i got seated, i found that it was well worth the struggle.  The seats are comfortable and visibility is good.  A couple instruments reveal when and how much the batteries are being charged.
