            Earlier this year I purchased a OlympusD 340R (see earlier review on that camera posted 5/8/00). I was thrilled with the camera when I bought it, and I still am.

However a few months ago, I took my camera to a family breakfast, and my sister was so impressed, that she decided to buy one also.

At this time I should point out that I have a very limited knowledge of digital camera specifics and how they work, my views are based on how easy the camera is to use and what the photos look like.

My sister's purchase of a digital camera was based exclusively on my glowing reports and use of my OlympusD 340R, AND the quality photo's I was able to send to everyone thru Email within hours of the breakfast.

But she hadn't written down the exact name of my camera, and when she started searching for the camera, she came across the OlympusD 450zoom and thought she was purchasing the same camera I had.

She called to tell me she was having a great time with the camera and that it was easy enough for her to be able to start using the camera within minutes of taking it out of the box.

At the next monthly family breakfast, she brought her camera, and was surprised that it wasn't the same camera as mine, however, I had a chance to use it and handle it and take numerous photos with it and found it to be super camera, extremely similar to mine, but with some minor differences.

The photo's taken by the OlympusD 450zoom were very good quality, sharp, clear and detailed. I viewed prints up to 5x7 that were comparable to any you would get at any professional photo developing company.

The purchase price on the OlympusD 450zoom was $350.00 (my OlympusD 340R was $279.00)

My ONLY petty gripe is that the control buttons are confusing and you do seem to constantly be referring back to the manual for help. (this is true of the OlympusD 340R also).  

When she handed me the camera, and asked for help on how to erase the photo's from the memory card, I found that I had to get into her manual, which was almost identical to mine, and hunt thru it to find the directions, as her camera was just enough different than mine, that I needed the help from the manual.

Things that could be a simple to do, take longer as the markings on the controls are vague, if at all.  After you have gotten used to the camera, you will not have to constantly be referring back to the manual, but at first it is a bit confusing.

The manual itself could be designed and written better, it tends to be the reason for the confusion. 

The 450zoom is a small, compact lightweight camera.  It easily fits into a purse, or average sized pocket and weighs next to nothing.

To take a basic photo is quick and easy. Simply line the subject up in the viewfinder, gently touch the shutter button, which will focus the photo for you, then continue to depress the shutter button. With the 450zoom, you can also take rapid photos with no pause in between photos, but with my 340R, there is a slight pause in between shots.

But basically,  how simple can you get?..point, gently touch shutter button, then depress all the way.

The OlympusD 450zoom has an automatic flash with five different flash modes, including a fill in flash, which I suggest using all the time, unless you are a more advanced camera user.  If you are into rapid shots, the flash can keep up with the fast shots.

The 3x Olympus zoom lens is equivalent to a 35-105mm zoom on a 35mm film camera.

You can view your pictures instantly thru the LCD viewfinder,and erase any that you do not want,  though this will deplete your batteries life quickly, and I do not recommend viewing them that way unless you have a spare pair of batteries on hand.

Under basic point and shoot usage, the battery life seems to be fairly long, as we were on over 300 shots and the batteries were still holding up (this is also true of my OlympusD 340R I have only had to replace batteries once and have probably shot over five hundred photos on it, but I try not to use the LCD viewing or shooting method).

If you choose to shoot thru the LCD viewer you will greatly reduce your battery life.

The camera uses tiny SmartMedia cards which will hold up to 122 photos (depending on how you have the camera set) and yes, the cards REALLY do hold that many photos (you can purchase optional 8, 16, and 32 MB 3.3 volt SmartMedia cards thru Olympus, or often a better price can be found on the internet).

I do advise you to NOT buy a bunch of the Smart Media cards, they are somewhat expensive, and what you have to gear yourself to, is that you are no longer using rolls of FILM, these little Smart Media Cards can be used over and over again.  

When I purchased my camera, I immediately searched the internet and found some good prices on the 8mb Smart Media cards ($16.99) and purchased four of them, this was in addition to the one that came with the camera.  

I have never had an occasion to even open the package they came in as  I am still using the same Smart Media card that came with my camera.

A Smart Media card reader is available for Olympus D series cameras, which allows you to simply insert the Smart Card into the reader which converts them for you into your computer, or you can get an adapter that you insert the Smart Card in and can then use it the same manner as a floppy. (which is what I have).

Probably the easiest and least expensive way is to plug the camera into your computer and view, then transfer the photos directly from your camera into your computer (which is what my sister does), but this can be a fairly slow process.

My method may or may not be the proper way, but what I do, with the 340R, is to transfer the photos from the camera to my computer, (using the floppy adapter), then I use the provided software,  Adobe Photo Deluxe and edit the photos I plan to keep. The editing aspects are wonderful, and you can convert a medicore photo into a small work of art. 

Then I either print the photo, or save it to a inexpensive floppy and delete any photos out of my computer that I don't want to store there, and even though my camera is the 340R, this would also apply to the 450zoom, as the same software is provided.

Storing to the floppy enables me to make copies of the photos, and give the floppys to friends or relatives that have a computer, AND not use up a lot of valuable storage space on my computer.

I can usually save about seven (more or less) photos per floppy.

<b>A SIMPLE COMPARISON CHART BETWEEN 340R AND 450ZOOM:

To be honest with you..I don't know which is a better camera, the OlympusD 340R or the OlympusD 450zoom. <b>(If you go to my profile page, the photo of Craftgun40 was taken with the OlympusD 340R)</b>   

They seem somewhat interchangeable to me, but I am not very versed in electronics, and both seem to be top quality cameras for $350.00 and under. 

When I purchased my OlympusD 340R I was told by several suppliers that the camera was being discontinued or replaced by newer models, so it may be more difficult to locate, though the OlympusD 450zoom seems to be everywhere. 

The difference in price was minimal, about $70.00 but may be less by now, by searching thru the internet.

I can easily and confidently recommend either camera to anyone first starting out, that wants a quality, easy to use, camera that takes fantastic photos, with little effort and is reasonably priced.

<b>Either camera is a great value for your money.</b>
