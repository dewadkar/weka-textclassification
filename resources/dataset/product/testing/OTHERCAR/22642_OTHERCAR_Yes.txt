            Now, You must understand that I am thrilled with this car!  I have put 3000 miles on it and still haven't gotten to the first car payment!  It is easy with this ease in driving and MPG to go ahead and say "let's go" as the gasoline cost is pretty insignificant!  

I live in an area in Arkansas where I drive 100 miles/day to work, hilly rural area and then some urban driving.  I have averaged 42-45 MPG with the Air conditioning running full speed!  It is a very "peppy" car and can get out of its way if needed.  Before purchase, we test drove it with the full 5 people, and it did fine with the A/C on, and at freeway speeds.  

Course you must consider that I hadn't had a "new" car in 19 years, and I am amazed at the thoughtful placement of buttons, switches, and the picture logos.  I still have mild dyslexia over the wipers, but others tell me that it is a matter of getting used to!!  

I got the Taffeta White model. The mechanics at the dealer related that the new Civic Hybrid had the identical engine as their 2-seater Insight.  They said that they had no "returns" on that car and they never saw them back for repair, just routine maintainance. 

I had mudflaps added to the car, as they are helpful on the dirt roads here.  Standard equipment for this model includes a CD changer, A/C, Rear DeIcer, and Electric windows and Locks. There was only one model on the dealer lot, and they were not willing to "bargain" on the price, so I paid full list price.  I justified it in that I knew I had alot of miles to drive this summer, and would probably appreciate having it even before the prices start to fall more as more Hybrids come out and hit the market.

This car seems to be a novelty around here, have had lots of questions, and peers that desire to drive it "to see if it really is that quiet and peppy?"  But I am thrilled and will be able to drive without gasoline cost being a concern!
