            Well! I didn't buy one, I rented one, for a business trip.  Nice car, handles well, looks good, seemed to get great mileage.

Drawback? On the 1999 models, you can pull the window out from the top of the door frame and &quot;open&quot; the door, with no breaking glass noise or mess, to &quot; procure the vehicle for unauthorized utilization via unauthorized, and unlawful access&quot;
In short---It's a breeze to steal one!---I speak as a victim, not a perpetrator.

I don't know if they have fixed this little issue on the newest ones, but i would check closely, and get a good system installed before taking one home!

I did find the 4-door model comfy, even for bigger people (&gt;size 18)<br><br>
