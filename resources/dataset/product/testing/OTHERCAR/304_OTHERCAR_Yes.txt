            I decided to do yet another SUV review.   This time I think I picked about the best.  The Nissan Xterra has won various awards this year, include Motor Trend�s �2000 Sport/Utility of the Year� award.  I don�t own this car, but I love riding my friends and test-driving them.

<i><b>Da Looks�</i></b>
I love the slick look of this car.  It practically tempts you to take it off road.  While not as big as a lot of the other, newer SUV�s, this one is perfectly comfortable on the road.  It has the ride of a luxury sports car, with the power of an SUV and handling of one.  A nice feature is the roof rack.  Their �ultra-modern powder-coated tubular aluminum� roof rack, as they call it, is very sporty.  It will probably support a good 130 pounds of whatever you want to put on it.  The step rails are also a very fine addition.  I figure this youthfully designed car weighs a good 4,000 pounds.  The tires are 265/70SR15; very big.

<i><b>On The Inside�</i></b>
The inside is just as great as the outside.  The cargo area is very generous.  You have about 10 tie down hooks to work with on floor and ceiling to secure your stuff.  12-volt outlets can be added about anywhere in the car in case you need it.  There are a great deal of standard features, though.  The base model comes with dual airbags, air conditioning, 50/50 split rear seat, cupholders all around, multi-adjustable driver�s seat, and 60-watt AM/FM radio with cassette or CD optional.  The rear cargo area has a max of 65.6 cubic feet of room when the seat is folded down.  

<i><b>The Models�</i></b>
A standard Xterra is the XE.  You can upgrade to the SE and get features such as the roof-rack and many other add-ons.  There are quite a few optional packages for the Xterra.  For about $1000, you can get the Utility Package, which incudes a rear wiper, tubular step rails, variable intermittent windshield-wipers, and the roof-rack system.  The Power Package is available for $1300 and provides you with power locks, windows, remote keyless entry and a vehicle security system.  Alloy wheels will run you about $600.  To upgrade to automatic transmission you�ll need to throw in another $1000.  

<b><i>Safety Features�</b></i>
It comes with dual �second generation� airbags which supposedly deploy with less force than a normal airbag.  It also comes with standard 4-wheel ABS brakes.  They also claim their seat-belts are extra protective but I didn�t notice a difference from any other car of that type.

<b><i>Who�s It For??</b></i>
This SUV appeals to younger, more active drivers.  While anyone could drive this, it�s aimed at those who are looking for a good time.  It�s price level also make it pretty accessible.  It gets back to the basics, and is known more for its utility than luxury.

<i><b>Other Stuff�</i></b>
For engines, you can choose from the 170-hp V6 or the 143-hp 4-cylinder.  It�s an all-around fun car that I�d suggest for anyone under 30.  For those over 30, go with a Lexus or BMW (hehe).
