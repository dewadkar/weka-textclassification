            I use the FD-91 on a regular basis, and think it's one of the nicest digital cameras I've ever handled for one very important reason; it feels like a REAL camera. 

No, you're not going to be able to stick it in your pocket like some of the other digital cameras on the market, but when you're out doing serious shooting, the traditional design of the FD-91 along with the zoom and the ability to use either the viewfinder or the lcd are well worth it. (aside: for portability while maintaining comparable image quality, check out Kodak's dc210. Or if you don't mind APS film, you can't go wrong with the Canon ELPH)

Sony's decision to use floppy disks has both drawbacks and benefits. The obvious benefit is that disks are CHEAP! You don't have to buy expensive flash memory. They are also compatible with just about any computer. The drawbacks, however, are that each disk doesn't hold that many images, and consequently if you're going on an extended trip, you need to pack along a big box of floppys. The disk access is also a fair bit slower than other technologies. 

The built in video recording feature is also quite fun. Admittedly, the image quality isn't so hot, but it's perfect for creating short videograms for email or (since it's a a floppy!) giving to people. We like to play candid camera with it, grabbing short clips of people around the office in various activities :)

If you can live with carrying disks around with you, and you want a professional feeling camera for less than $1000, I think you'll be very happy with the FD-91. It's certainly better than any of the other Mavica's as well, both in design as well as quality. Unfortunatly it shares the family gene of being slightly overpriced.
