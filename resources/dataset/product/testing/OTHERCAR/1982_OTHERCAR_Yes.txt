            ***June 20, 2000---Well it's been six months since I wrote my initial review (*) and I now have 11,652 miles on my oh so silky sweet and smooth Maxima.  And I still have nothing but praise and joy to say about this vehicle.  Everything continues to operate precisely as it had when it only had 3 miles on the odometer when I received delivery of it just 10 months ago.  Never, have I had a problem with starting, stalling, rough idling, braking, shifting, steering, opening, closing, locking, etc. or of any kind with this vehicle.  After 4 oil changes (at no cost to me) and after it's 7,500 mile recommended maintenance service ($75)...and I've stopped counting the number of fuel top offs after 30 (@$1.69 to $1.92 per gallon for Premium...I was getting sick of looking at the total cost in the calculations of these ever rising gas prices) and after nearly 35 car washes (gotta keep her clean, shiny and ready for the road), I haven't had to spend anything more on this &quot;almost impassable&quot; street machine.  I say it again, the 2000 Nissan Maxima (preferably an SE) is in my E-PINION, an excellent buy and a great overall value!
