            I purchased a Durango in February and it's been a pleasure ever since. The truck is solid. I have the large v8 option and it accelerates without any hesitation. Gas is a problem, it does guzzle. The leather trim inside is awesome and you feel like you own a quality car when you are inside. I have had no problems with the truck. I would recommend getting the 3rd seat option for anyone who buys this vehicle (family or not). It is a cheap and convenient option for the family who even just occasionally has to pack an extra bunch of passengers to the little league game. The sound system is very good and the steering wheel controls are very convenient. You will like this truck if you have ever driven an SUV. I also own a 4Runner (Toyota) and the Durango is a lot more fun to drive. The pick up is superior and the interior is definitely roomier. I would recommend this truck to anyone who thinks they should get a MINIVAN. This is a lot more practical and MUCH cooler looking. I have found it hard to hate anything about the vehicle but it could improve a bit on the center console. No big deal but I prefer more room to store stuff. The back seats are very roomy for the kids and they love their own cup holders. If you do not like a STIFF ride, stay away from this vehicle. The engine is loud.  My least favorite feature is the mileage but I knew that before I bought. Take this car for a test drive and you will be sold.
