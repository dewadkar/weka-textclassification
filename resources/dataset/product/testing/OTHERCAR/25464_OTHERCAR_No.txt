            I bought a brand new Saturn SL-1 after months of researching cars.  This was the one and only time in my life that I was or will be able to pay cash for a car so I wanted to get something safe and reliable.  Two days after this purchase, I attempted to brake a little harder than normal.  The wheels locked up and I skidded out of control into a ditch.  I didn't slam on the brakes - just tried braking a little harder than normal.  

I contacted Saturn who sent out a &quot;team of experts&quot; to look at the car.  They stated that there was nothing wrong with it and it acted in a normal and appropriate manner. (I'm serious).  I have never been so disappointed in my life.  Apparently anti-lock brakes are optional on this car and even when you get the anti-lock brakes they don't work so well.  

Eventually they replaced the first car with another Saturn SL-1 with anti-lock brakes and it did the same thing.  I traded it in on a Toyota Camry and got only 1/2 of what I originally paid for the Saturn as a trade in value although it had less than 200 miles on it.  Apparently, not many people think much of the Saturn.  

So, if you're looking for a safe car, DO NOT buy the Saturn SL-1 (or any other Saturn for that matter).  The staff at Saturn was nice enough until I became dissatisfied with my purchase, at which point they started getting just plain nasty.  Sure, it's a &quot;different kind of car company&quot; but different isn't always good.<br><br>
