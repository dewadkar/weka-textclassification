            I bought my X-terra 3 months ago. Background: My girlfriend bought a boat and we needed something to tow it - plus I live in N. Ca. up in elevation and wanted a 4 wheeler to get around in the snow and such so I got the SE.

I love it! - It is comfortable, handles very well, the rear bench is elevated a couple of inches above the front seat in what they call stadium seating - very good idea.  The dash is very clean and easy to read - the tow package is very integrated with the frame of the truck - all is well thought out - I had one small problem and that was where to plug in the trailer electrical harness that was provided.  Even the mechanic at the dealership had to make a phone call to find where the connection was hid.

Overall the truck is great - love the ride, love how it handles, like it's looks, do enjoy others looking at it - and for the price - very, very nice! 

One problem - its a little under powered for towing. The 3.3 liter is a little small for the tow of the boat (now this is a 18 ft. sea swirl spider, with a 350 chevy block - whoa we got some muscle there!).  I have to stay over to the slow lane when I tow my babe's boat. <br><br>
