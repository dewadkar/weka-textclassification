              I was never a big fan of Dodge pickups until now.
  My husband(a major Dodge man)has owned several Dodge trucks since our marriage.  They all road like log trucks.
  When he decided it was time to get his first brand new pickup he was adamant it had to be the new Ram Truck.  Because we haul a four horse trailer on a regular basis he wanted the Cummins engine and all the extras.  We went looking at prices and packages.
  Although he swore the new trucks were different I wasn't convinced.  Knowing Dodge trucks I wouldn't even take a test ride.  My theory was it is his truck and I only have to use it when we take the trailer.
  After great research we ordered a truck built just for him.  When it arrived three months later he was like a kid in a candy store.  I took him to the dealer and we brought it home.
  A few days later I had to hook up the trailer to pick up some hay at a farm down the road a ways.  I had expectations of a terribly rough ride
and knew I would regret having to take the new truck.
  By the time I got to the end of our gravel road I had completely changed my mind about Dodge trucks.  In fact he teases me now that he would like to get a chance to put at least half the miles on the odometer before I wear out the truck.
  Our truck is a 1997 with the extended cab and has over seventy five thousand miles on it already.  It has never given us a stitch of trouble and still looks and rides like it is fresh off the show room floor.  The interior of the cab is more than comfortable and more on the line of a luxury car than a pickup.  It rides better than my mother's Cadillac and handles(even with the trailer)better than any truck I've owned.
  I have to admit I've been converted to Dodge trucks.  If you give them a test drive you will be too.
