            This was my first 4 door sedan, EVER!  I had owned two previous XJS convertibles and loved them as well.  I have to admit, it is a &quot;battle cruiser&quot; but the best looking large car on the road.  The design is timeless yet still fresh.  I don't get the ego feedback I did from the convertibles as most people figure anyone with a Vanden Plas must be over 60 but, if you like the way a Jaguar makes you feel to drive and like opulent luxury, it's a great car at a great price. The build quality is terrific and the service department could not be more responsive.  I have had so few problems with any of my Jaguars it will be a hard decision to give them up.  (Which I will do as i want a 4 seat convertible and am looking at the Volvo. I miss the top down feeling.) The car is quick and handles reasonably well for such a large vehicle.
The downside to a Jaguar:  It does not retain it's value very well.  There are many '98 Jaguars at the dealer I go to at half the original cost.  I suppose the quality Jaguar is building into these cars has not yet earned the reputation other imported luxury cars have earned.
I sure wish Jag would come out with a 4 seat convertible to compete with the Volvo and the Mercedes CLK.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat.<br><br>
