            I bot a 1995 Acura Legend Coupe brand new, and it was the
worst car purchase I have ever made in my life.
Acceleration was very very poor even tho the car
had 230 HP.
The car alarm would go off when you keyed open the
door, the brakes would sink to the floor before
slowing the car, the cruise control would jerk
the car continually (like the car was hitting the
brakes all the time-jerk jerk jerk jerk)
the trim around the windows was coming undone...
and, when I complained to the Acura dealer--they 
wanted no part of fixing the car--I was treated 
like a stupid female who knew nothing about
cars! And the car was under warrenty!!!
For a car purchased brand new at
$40K, and only 11 miles on it, by the time one 
year was up, and I had 7K miles on it, I was ready
to dump it and all of the problems I had with it--
Purchase an Acura only if you are a male, so the
dealerships will treat you as an equal rather than
a stupid female who knows nothing about cars!
I had owned nothing but Honda/Acura cars since
1980 when I purchased a brand new Honda Prelude, 
and this was my 2nd Legend coupe--if I live to
be 200 years old, I will never own another Honda/
Acura product again after the 'treatment' I got
from Acura over this car!!
