            I've been primarily a Nikon and Minolta fan for the better part of the last two decades and I waited for the D30 just to be fair.  Mind you I'd made up my mind after carefully reviewing it that I was going to get a D1 and Canon couldn't sway me, especially since the Fuji S1 Pro really overall had not impressed me.  Having spent some serious time with both the Fuji S1 and the Nikon D1, I felt it only fair to do the same with the Canon D30.  

I've had the D30 now two short weeks but the D1 has already gone back, the D30 is a keeper!  Yes the D30 has some short comings, in fairness so too do the others mentioned, but overall it has more going for it than either of the others and the SINGLE most important feature is the image quality!  Canon's new CMOS sensor produces quite simply the cleanest, most beautiful images I've EVER seen from a Digital Camera bar NONE!  Some reference has been made to the D30's images being somewhat soft, and honestly I prefer them that way!  I've been a photographer now for just over a quarter century, and have done everything including a great deal of my own darkroom work in both B&amp;W and Color and respect Canon's decision to leave the images alone.  No in camera sharpening (a process that CAN NOT be reversed) is performed on the D30 images before you get them which means you can decide how much you want to use, and use the tools in Photoshop or Paintshop Pro to get faster, better quality than available in hardware.  For archival purposes of course you can store the original somewhere for posterity, and that suits me to a T, just like a negative that I can leverage in a darkroom later to get exactly the image I'm looking for.

The D30 captures images in a number of formats, all excellent quality and capable of being edited with everything from Photoshop to the software that comes with the camera and everything in between.  One of the exceptional features of this camera is the RAW format and the ability to manipulate them right out of the box.  In stark contrast to the D1 (which requires the purchase of roughly $500 dollars worth of additional software) the D30 comes ready to play with RAW images right out of the box.  The D30's RAW images really shine, and afford a great deal of flexibility and power in terms of final output options.  I've used everything from Genuine Fractals Print Pro to Paintshop Pro's smart resize on the RAW images out of this camera and have to give them high marks!  Honestly the quality of the RAW images is so great that Paintshop Pro 7's smart resize renders a near perfect, no loss image at 500% that compares favorably with the output of Genuine Fractals output at 500%, in short you really DO NOT need to spend the extra money for Genuine Fractals to get 36x48 prints from bignose.com and the 35mm ratio makes the D30 images simple to print regardless of the size without loss. 

Overall the D30 is a stable, high quality entry into the Digital SLR realm and CAN NOT be beat for image quality which is after all what the whole concept is all about.  Creative control is there, with the ability to switch into true match needle manual mode for the ultimate in flexibility, and of course high speed fully automatic burst shooting at up to 3 frames per second depending on the circumstances.  The AF system is not appreciably slower or faster than any of my other AF rigs and performs well even in fairly low light.  Fit and finish of the camera is worthy of the price tag and the vertical grip/additional battery holder is a worthy addition to the camera, worth in my opinion twice the price.

One of the other great features of this camera is Canon's commitment to the Lens format, in stark contrast to the S1 Pro, and the D1, the D30 takes EVERY Canon AF lens out there.  The lenses go from my EOS-650 (One of Canon's oldest) to the D30 without so much as a glitch, and that really can't be said for either of the other two.  Lens control and behavior is excellent with the camera storing ALL the details about any given shot into the data space of the image, including the current zoom setting (a nice touch) for each frame.

While admittedly the viewfinder doesn't show 100% coverage, I don't find it to be a problem at all, I tend to shoot in a conservative time honored format following the rule of thirds, so the camera collecting a touch more than I see when I shoot just gives me a little extra wiggle room, but otherwise has NO impact on my shots.  The viewfinder is crisp and clear with no dark or blurry areas and presents a brighter image with more information than my aforementioned 650, and of course the purist in me loves the true match needle manual mode.  Match needle manual is accomplished by the exposure compensation display serving dual purpose in the viewfinder.  The depth of field preview button works exactly as it does on any film camera and gives you just what you'd expect from it.  One of the nice features of Canon SLR'S in general is the &quot;automatic depth of field&quot; mode which is outside the scope of this review to explain but imagine a mode that lets you specify the foreground and background ranges and the camera selects the right F-stop and shutter speed to accomplish the desired effect.  Very nice feature!

I could go on about this camera for hours, and pick to death all the little pros and cons, but will instead opt to let you find your own way with the camera.  Be it enough said that just about anything you want to use this camera for it will handle it with more than enough &quot;pro&quot; to be in my humble opinion to more than compete with the Nikon D1 and Fuji S1 Pro.  I would recommend that Nikon and Fuji start working HARD on their next &quot;Pro-grade&quot; rigs since the D30 is really only a consumer grade rig and Canon is reported to be working on a &quot;real&quot; Pro digital rig.  If this is a consumer rig, then the Pro model will dominate the market for years to come.

So regardless of what you want to use it for, the D30 is an absolute joy to behold and a rugged enough digital powerhouse to deliver the goods with image quality BETTER than anything else on the market for even twice the price.  It may not be as rugged as the D1, may not be as waterproof as the D1, but with a little respect it will out perform the D1 and the S1 in terms of image quality every day of the week without complaint.  Stop in at www.dpreview.com and look up their D1/D30 side by side review of image quality if you don't believe me, but once you compare you'll have to spend less to get more quality!

P.S.  IT IS available from online stores, you just might have to wait a while.  I got mine from http://www.vistek.net or call 800-561-1777 Ext. 3237 and have Sheldon send you one with the grip and an extra battery!  Also seen available from mycamera.com, ssdonline.com and ritz.com in limited quantities but WELL worth the wait!!!! 


<b>One additional Note of interest:</b>

While surfing the net I came across an interesting article that speaks directly to the issue of image quality and shows the advantages the additional dynamic range of digital provides:  Written by Michael H. Reichmann, the article takes on the very real issue of how much difference plus or minus there is between film and the D30.  The results WILL surprise you if you have not worked with the D30 before.  Sometime in the next several weeks I'm going to conduct a similar test myself and make the results available here.  Quite simply the D30 has better image quality than FILM, and you can judge this yourself by reviewing Michael's well written article on his site.  Michael's D30 vs. Film study can be found at:  <b>http://www.luminous-landscape.com/d30_vs_film.htm</b>

If you are seriously torn between the D30 and a similar film model read the review above, YOU WILL BE GLAD you did!!!!<br><br>
