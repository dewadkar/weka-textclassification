            Ok, now I don't own a Volvo...I can only wish for one.  I am of course a college student who can't exactly afford to splurge on such an extravagant car.  However, I would like to agree that Volvos are safe, comfortable, and give you a great ride.  

This luxury car even comes with seat warmers, and in these cold winter months-that is a definite plus!  You can customize the features you want in your car without any problem, and of course drive around in style.  

I would like to point out though, that since these are mainly foreign-made cars, the parts are difficult to locate, and even more expensive to purchase and have installed.  If you have a problem with something, you're almost always out of luck with pricing and installment issues.  

When choosing a car, my personal belief is not that you should get something that will fulfill your needs now, but down the road as well...hee hee.  I'm not saying that a Volvo is unreliable by any means, just be sure to weigh all of your options before deciding to go with luxury as your top choice for a vehicle!<br><br>
