            If you are a reader, even a casual one, of ANY current automotive publication, you have undoubtedly heard endless raves, swooning and praises for the entire BMW 3-Series family. As a regular reader of three of the largest (Automobile, Car and Driver, Motor Trend), I can honestly say that I was downright tired of the monotony! When I cracked open an issue for the first time and spied a comparison test that included the 3-Series, hopes of another car winning always arose in my head. This wasn�t due to an inherent dislike of this evidently amazing car, but the sheer tediousness was getting on my nerves. BMW has, in recent history, become so synonymous with sportiness and luxury, that its �Ultimate Driving Maching� credo has definitely replaced Cadillac�s archaic �Standard of the World� slogan in the hearts of image-conscious America. Lexus� �The Passionate Pursuit of Perfection,� Mercedes� �Unlike any Other,� but especially Lincoln�s �American Luxury,� for instance, haven�t a chance. In fact, the only two comparos come to mind where the mighty Bimmer was toppled: Car and Driver, April 2001 when a 325ix wagon was slaughtered by an Audi A4 1.8T Avant. The other was in the April 1999 issue of the same magazine where an Audi A4 1.8T beat the then-new 325i by one measly point. A test a few months earlier in the same magazine with the two upper variants of the same models�328i and A4 2.8�gave the victory to the BMW, but only one point ahead of the Audi. I am honestly a die-hard Audi/Volkswagen fan, but as much I was enamored of the precious four rings, I could not resist checking out what could possibly beat such a perfect (in its own right) car as the A4. If, out of it�s formidable competition (Cadillac CTS, Infiniti G35, Acura 3.2CL Type S, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Volvo S60, etc.), only the Audi A4 could ever come close to a victory against the big boy from Munich, BMW had to have something good on its hands. 

I previously owned a 1993 325is, but my younger sibling who is six years my junior just reached the magical age of sixteen, so I decided to give him the car as a gift. I purchased it with 62K on the odometer, and drove it extremely hard during its tenure with me. It never upset me, never gave me a headache, and always seemed to beg me to go a little faster. I�m confident that my little bro will easily take it past the 100,000 mile mark without so much as a single glitch. Stunning would be an unfair understatement for this little piece of work, as it still looks great and has held up curiously well considering my abuse. It left a favorable impression of BMW as a whole on me. Anyway, down to business-

After giving up my little buddy 325is, all the cars in my stable were made by VW/Audi. I put it off for quite a while, but decided that it would be nice to keep a BMW in my garage, based solely on my previous experience with the marque. The motor oil coursing through my veins prompted me into a BMW showroom one early morning, where I was greeted by terrible coffee and ostentatious salespeople. An air of shrewd pomposity filled the air. I wasn�t exactly ignored at first, but it was only after a few people saw the Gucci logo emblazoned on my sunglasses that anyone could be called friendly. This, of course has nothing to do with the car, but BMW (and, as I�ve experienced, Lexus) really could learn something from Audi as far as dealership friendliness goes. 

There were several models to choose from on the lot, but I drifted to the sexy little noir 330Ci in the showroom. Manual transmission? Check. Black paint? Check. Eerily, this car looked almost too much like the 9-year-old 3 series I gave up. It didn�t matter too much though, as it was still lithe and very attractive, although not as chiseled or distinctive as any Audi. I guess not messing with success is, after all, a smart strategy. I popped the door open and sat inside. The gauges were essentially unchanged�save for some details�from the previous generation, which was quite surprising, too, considering the emphasis BMW put on the substantial update from E36 (1992-1998) to E46 (1999-) 3. The rest of the interior was definitely new, though. It was very, very comfortable, yet sport oriented. Aluminum accents abound, yards of red leather (very tasteful, actually), and ergonomically sound controls all did their parts to spice up the aesthetically pleasing interior. I was just a bit surprised to see so many little resemblances to the old car all over. I released the hood (electronically) and raised it. The kidney-bean grille raises with the hood, and adds a definite touch of class the E36 lacked. Everything was sound and tough looking underhood. BMW is one of the few carmakers that doesn�t hide its engines under fake plastic covers. They look wonderful, even artful without them!

An exceptionally tall man removed the car from the showroom at my request, and I was free to take the car out after I verified my driver�s license and insurance info with him. I had never been on a test drive without the watchful eye of a salesperson in the passenger seat! I pondered the legality of the situation, but didn�t hesitate to jump behind the wheel and listen to that ultra rewarding exhaust note. I revved the engine in Neutral to redline twice, and kicked it into reverse. BMW shift patterns are unconventional�reverse is to the left and north of first gear, which takes some getting used to, but makes a lot of sense. I had no reservations about flogging this car on the interstate, mashing the pedal to the floor, running it to redline at every chance, playing with the nice sound system, and making two smoky burnouts. Everything felt right, everything felt stable and balanced. This car actually felt ALIVE.  There are no English words to describe it. It was a downright pleasure, and I instantly realized exactly why those automotive journalists (whom I had always suspected were being paid off by BMW) had devoted so many glowing adjectives to this brilliant Bavarian. 

Astonishingly, there was no little quirk that caught my keen attention or flaw that attracted my scrutiny on that most memorable of test drives. Not only did this thing handle with alarming tenacity, but it rode much better than I thought. It wasn�t Mercedes silent, but it was quiet in all the ways a proper ways a car should be: no wind noise, no creaks or rattles, just a brassy snarling exhaust note with appropriate tire noise and transmission snicker. The pedals and transmission layout, though, were the best part of the package�the only front on which I can safely say that this car is better than the Audis of my heart. They fit like the best tailor at Dolce & Gabbanna made them just for me, and they have sort of a telepathic immediacy and razor sharp, crystal clear feedback that even a Ferarri would be blessed to be endowed with. 

I had no choice but to buy this baby! I believe the rather steep price is more than justified by its persona, but you may want to lay off some options. Based on my experience, very minimal options can severely balloon the sticker tag. If you�re a real driver, you�ll consider yourself lucky when you save a few grand by optioning away from the autoshifter. It�s way pricey. Fuel economy is good, oil changes are provided under warranty for a period by a dealer every 5000 miles, and you are given a complimentary subscription to BMW magazine. 

That�s it. All other details seem trivial when you put them into context. This car is THAT good.  

Chances are, if you're tired of the raving about this car, you haven't driven one!
