            I did quite bit of research before I bought my 2000 LS PREM Sable in July, 2000. The requirements of traction control, side impact airbags, 6-way passenger seat, not a gas guzzler, and a reasonable report from Consumer Report had reduced the number of candidates down considerably. The adjustable pedals(my wife is rather short) and reasonable price sealed the deal. I have to say the attractive styling also plays a part.
I have put on seven thousand miles on the car now with no problem or defect to speak of. The handling of the car is superb. Ride is good with road feel. Engine power is more than ample for any kind of driving. Gas mileage of 21-22 city and 27-29 highway is quite good considering the 210 hp engine. The more one is familiarized with the details of the many features of the car, the more I am impressed with the thoughts and qualities built into the car. Little things like double visors, dual heated mirror, very convenient, compact, CD changer in the center console, great temperature control with effective rear seat heat vent, variable size cup holders (that one convinced my wife), and high quality leather and wood finish just make the car appears to be a luxury car. I saw equivalent &quot; luxury&quot; car at least six thousand dollars more than the under 22,000 price I paid.
