            I bought a 1995 dodge neon for $6000 canadian.It had done 134000kms.  At the time,  I needed a cheap car and this was the only one in my price range and a recent year.  ( Bought it in 1998 ). 
 First the problems.  When I bought it,  two days later, the transmission goes.  Luckly, due to the 30 day lemon warranty,  it was replaced at no cost.  Then,  the air conditioner doesn't work and I have tried fixing it but It will never work. UP TO THIS DAY IT HASN'T WORKED!  I realized that it was a DODGE!  N-E-ways,  it was running ok for about an year than the tires needed changing.  I realized it wasn't the cars fault but normal ware and tare.  Later,  the brakes go and had to replace the front rotors and pads.  
after, when I came back from vacation in the summer,  the next day when I started my car,  it dies.  First I thought it was the battery but then I took it to a mechanic and they told me it was the alternator.  I thought "Great",  after my vacation.
Now,  the major problem is my car is leaking oil.  And that basically leads up to a new "HEAD GASKET".  Every car I ever own,  I always have to put a new head gasket.  

The only goods things I can say about neons are leg room and the stereo.  everything else is Junk.  
So,  if you like the design of the car,  and YOU KNOW A GOOD mechanic,  then buy the car,  or you'll feel sorry.
