            <b>Personal Background</b>
The (first &) last time I held an SLR camera in my grubby little hands was way back when I was 13 and the camera(s) in question belonged to my high school's photography department.  Since it was a camera pool, there were Nikons, Minoltas and a few Pentaxes thrown in there.

Using this expensive piece of equipment was like losing my virginity - it made me feel grown up and professional (well, I was 13 years old).  The fumes in the dark room weren't too bad either.

After that experience, photography was limited to the point and shoot film variety, losing it's glam along the way (sort of like what happens after too much mediocre sex).

Recently, some very special needs required that I buy a high quality digital camera to take very clear, close up pictures.  Fortuitously for me, Canon was just releasing the EOS300D in my country, so I snapped one up on the day it was released.

<b>Performance</b>
What can I say.  I've discovered a new lover who magically possesses Ricky Martin hips, Vin Diesel's biceps and Ashton Kutcher's face.  Now I can do it 300 times a day, recharge my battery for 60 minutes and do it all over again.  And again.  And again.

As said before, I am an amateur in the true sense of the word, so you won't get much by way of tech stats here - anyway, all that has been covered thoroughly by the previous reviewers.  

<b>Auto-focus for the novice / Manual for the wannabes</b>
I love the fact that this camera is easy to use in the point and shoot mode, while giving great, sharp digital images.  I have noticed that it's necessary to hold the camera very still when taking close ups, so I would recommend a tripod if you are planning on taking lots of those.

The manual mode is also fantastic for a beginner like me - the camera is quite easy to navigate and it doesn't take long to figure out what buttons to press to get the best result.  The camera also has lots of great functions which would appeal to beginners - like the "sports" modes and the "continuous clicking" function. (I can just SEE all those pros out there going "another fool, easily parted" - yep, that's me!")

<b>Downloading your photos</b>
Software was fast and easy to install and use, although the downloading time for the photos is on the slow side - that's probably just my computer.  

<b>Battery Life</b>
And folks... the battery life is PHENOMENAL!  I can take and download over 300 photos over 3 days before I need to recharge my battery.  To me, this seems much better than my friends' "point and shoots" which only last about an hour before going flat.  This is probably because you can't use the LCD to view photos before taking as with most point and shoots (LCDs drain battery life pronto).  This function is restricted due to the mechanics behind SLR technology - so it's one you will just have to live with if you want the flexibility and quality of an SLR.

<b>Bottom Line</b>
I think this is a great "starter" camera for those who are bored of their fixed lens, auto-focus cameras and want to take the next step into experimenting with taking better photos or becoming a "photo-hobbyist".  The digital function is great for learners - no need to "waste" film and developing costs, while these images are clear enough to get any beginner excited about photography.  I hear lots of pros complaining about the plastic body, however, I think most real beginners won't have problems with this.  Plus, the camera may be plastic, but I find it is still very solid - it feels like an SLR, not a plastic toy.  

Of course, factor in the price /value and you have a win-win situation.

<b>Bifocals</b>
You get: The camera, the lens cover (claw), the around the shoulder tourist strap, the battery charger, one battery, Canon photo downloading software, the digital cable to connect your camera to your computer to download pictures for storing and printing.

You have to buy: A memory card for the camera to store photos on (you don't get one with the camera).  I'd suggest a 512meg card to maximize your photo taking abilities.  This takes around 160 full resolution (6.3) photos.  You can set the camera to take medium or low resolution pics to save on card space.
