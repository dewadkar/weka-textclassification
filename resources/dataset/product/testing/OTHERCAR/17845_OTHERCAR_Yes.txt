            We recently purchased a 2000 Chevy Blzer. We have been thinking of going the SUV route for a couple of years, but they seemed so high priced. We also test drove over 5 different vehicles and read up on several of the top sellers. After driving all vehicles and looking over all different options and prioritizing WHY we needed a SUV, we finally chose the Chevy Blazer. We are thrilled with our puchase. 

We had a great expereince with our Chevy dealer--not too much pressure, and they actually listened to what we wanted, our budget, etc. We got the options that were important to us-not them. Childprooof locks, CD player, 4 wheel drive, remote entry, air. Plus the vehicle looks great! It also came with a great warranty, 3 years or 36000 miles. Our son loves riding in his new truck-and we finally have some extra room to haul things! It's easy to drive and handles beautifully-plus it isn't nearly as noisy as some other SUV's we drove. For our first SUV purchase, we are very pleased.!

I think this vehicle is a great vehicle for families, or even couples--
it still feels like a car, not a huge truck, easy to handle and very comfortable--the interior is wonderful! We have not found anything we dislike about this vehicle, except it uses more gas than we were used to!<br><br>
