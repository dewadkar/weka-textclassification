            I've had my 2000 Monte Carlo LS for 3 weeks now.  I bought it for the looks. It's gorgeous!!! When I test drove it, I was disappointed. It drove like a race car, low to the ground...but it's gorgeous!! I still bought it. It's  comfy, but difficult to back up. You cannot even see the trunk out the rear view mirror, or when you look around, let alone the end of the car...but it's gorgeous!!   Gas mileage is great at 26 mpg.  Not bad for a midsize sports coupe.  And it's gorgeous.  Plenty of amenities, and a nice sound system to boot.  People stop and stare with envy.  Buy one today. <br><br>
