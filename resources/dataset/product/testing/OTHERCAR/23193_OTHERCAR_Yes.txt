            As most people know Honda's are EXCELLENT cars that hold up to their reputation.  I own a 1996 Honda Accord EX and have been extremely pleased with my purchase.  BUT I think there are TWO things a buyer should be aware of when buying the '96 Honda Accord.   

First: Your Honda may begin to make a low rumbling sound (slightly annoying and gets louder as time goes on) that goes in and out between 30 and 40 mph.  This is nothing major but is something the '96 (and a couple of other year models) begin doing as they get a bit older.  I recently spoke to my Honda mechanic about this and he said it is something he sees often.  Stay on top of the problem and it should not be a very expensive thing to fix.

Second:  This problem is far more expensive to fix ($1000+).  It has to do with the ABS break system - an extra safety feature you pay for when you buy the EX model.  There is a small faulty part that goes out and the part is the expensive part - not the time and labor.  The fact of the matter is your breaks will work just fine with out the ABS break system but the light will go on in your dash board indicating something is wrong.  If you have strict State inspections, you will not pass because the light is on and you MUST pay to fix the part.  
My Honda dealer recommended calling the American Honda Headquarters to ask about the problem and see if they will reimburse for some of the expense since it is a faulty part they put out.  It is done on a case by case basis - here is the number (301).990.2000 <br><br>
