            <b>***UPDATE*** 7/02/00
I just returned from vacation {a sightseeing (driving) vacation}.  You won't believe how GREAT my car did on gasoline usage.  On the Interstates, I got about 40 MPG...using cruise control, 3 people and having the car fully packed with luggage and necessities, cooler, etc...it was just great!!!  It performed at maximum!!  It was great, I took it ahead of time to have all my fluid levels and tire pressure checked, and the oil changed.  I drove a total of 2400 miles and spent only $123.00 in gasoline and had some left when we returned home! AWESOME!!!</b>

I bought a 1998 V6 Used Pontiac Grand Am GT.  Why, you ask!  I have good reason and good cause.  My previous car was a 1990 Grand Am which I also purchased used, it had 12,000 miles on it...bought it for $10,000 flat out! When I traded it, it had over 110,000 miles and was still going strong.  I loved my 1990 Grand Am and His name was Jessie.  Jessie lasted me until September 1999, and longer if I had wanted it too!  I NEVER had a major problem with Jessie.  I had brake pads replaced and standard maintenance, and after 8 years I replaced the top of the radiator (I'm sure that was expected). 

The great thing about the 1990 Grand AM was that it had a TIMING CHAIN, not a belt, the thing never broke!  It was GREAT!

Now, the <b>NEWER 1998 Grand Am GT</b> <i>DOESN'T</i> have that Timing Chain, it has the new <b>V-belt</b> (I'm sorry to say I don't have any experience with it).  They told me it was supposed to last until about 80,000 miles--and I'm skeptical about that! I purchased this used car still with the warranty in tact (I would suggest trying to find a used car still under warranty or buy a new one!).

I love the comfort of the 1998 car and it has a classy modern sports car look, and it's the wide track---very sturdy on the road. It has <b>dual air bags (driver and front passenger)</b>.  It has <b>Anti-Lock Brakes</b> which I still have to get used to and automatic door lock/unlock, and trunk opening.  The tires are wide, which give you more control on the road, and takes a bit getting used to. 

The interior is grey and quite attractive.  I would suggest buying seat covers anyway for extra protection. It's also roomy, spacious and comfortable, my back seat does NOT fold down, I saw other models that did.  I have the 4-door model.  I like the fact that the back doors open much wider than my 1990 did (I had trouble with the 1990 model fitting large purchases or boxes in the back seat). 

I love the CD player and radio which has easy to change channels and select tracks to play.  All gauges are easy to understand, and well lit at night!  One of the most interesting features is, that the headlights are automatic, they have light sensors in them and they automatically turn on when they need too--really cool!  Daylight running lights are also another feature.

<b>Consider these when buying</b>...there are no rain gutters to catch the rain when getting in and out of the car, and the step into the car is about a good 12 inches (not good for older folks)...I have twisted my ankle about 4 times so far..the seat belts get twisted fairly easily.  

Mine is a beautiful metalic Green, the color of grass, nature, trees, money!  Speaking of money, they have some great deals going on lately even with the NEW 2000's.  I have seen them go for about $199/mo (of course, I'm paying more than that...you have to qualify for that great price--if you have good credit and a nice down--go for it!

Update:  I have had the Car since Sept 99 and now it's April 2000!  My car has been great and I'm really getting a feeling for it.  I haven't had any problems with it, just an oil change.  It's been pretty good on gasoline...I have been able to fill it up and do my regular shopping and working driving and a topped off tank of gas has lasted me about 2 weeks.
I'm estimating 20-24 mpg.  I'll check this again and get back to you!

Some insurance agencies will give you a discount for the ABS brakes and Dual Air Bags!

I still love it!!<br><br>
