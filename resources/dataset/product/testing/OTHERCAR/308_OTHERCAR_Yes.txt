            Today, we ventured out into the rain and visited the local Nissan dealership.  The vehicle that instantly grabbed our attention out of a lot full of Altimas, Maximas and Sentras was a shocking yellow Xterra, which we took for a test drive.

The &quot;special order&quot; Solar Yellow paint on the Xterra XE 4x4 we tested fits this SUV's mission to a tee.  <b>This is an &quot;image&quot; vehicle,</b> designed to grab  your attention and say, &quot;Hey!  You there!&quot;  I have to say that I didn't like the styling at first, but it's grown on me in the past month or two, with its chunky flared fenders, tubular roof rack and carry basket, and raised rear roof <i>a la</i> Olds Vista Cruiser, minus the roof glass.  The Xterra <i>looks</i> like a rough 'n tumble off-roader.

Climbing into the Xterra is easy, with the tubular running board and <b>well-placed grab handles</b> on the A-pillars.  My five-foot-tall, 7-month-pregnant wife had nothing but praise for the ease of entry into this 4x4.  Climbing out, though, those running boards protrude enough to wipe their road-grunge on the back of your pantleg, unless you're careful.  Once inside, the seats are rather firm.  The seat bottom is flat, and the seatback is dished out without much support.  Though not very comfortable at first, the seats grew on us over the drive.

The interior is a mixed bag.  <b>Generally well-constructed,</b> Nissan reserved the high-quality materials for the areas that people are expected to touch more, like the HVAC controls, steering wheel, shift levers and so on.  The parts that don't usually get touched, though, like the dashboard, instrument cluster and other non-control, non-switch locations, are done in hard plastic that simply feels cheap to the touch.  <b>No rattles </b>surfaced during our test, however.

The controls were generally well laid out, with a few exceptions.  The gauges were all highly visible, including the standard tachometer.  The heater controls were mounted high on the dash, above the stereo.  Many prefer the radio mounted high, as more people adjust it more frequently than the heater.  I like the HVAC controls above the radio, though, since I <i>may</i> have to deal with a suddenly fogged window, but I never <i>need</i> to adjust the radio station more than I need to see the road.  But that's a personal thing of mine.  The HVAC was easy to understand and use, as was the radio, though I had my wife adjust it rather than take my eyes from the road.

The inconsistencies in the cabin were the cruise control switch, mounted very low and to the left, the power mirror adjuster, which was loose and rickety feeling, and the rear wiper switch, mounted next to the cruise switch.

The raised rear roof provides <b>plenty of headroom</b> for rear-seat passengers, who are placed high up in the cabin, able to see over the driver's shoulder.  Rear legroom was sufficient to let me sit behind the driver's seat which I had adjusted to suit my own long legs...a feat not possible in many vehicles.  The rear seat is split to fold down, and does so easily, though to get a flat load floor, one must actually remove the rear seat-bottom, rather than simply folding it up as in other vehicles.  A gimmicky, yet intriguing touch was the <b>optional first aid kit </b>belted to the inside of the rear hatch...and hinted at by the bulge on the outside of the rear hatch.

Pulling out into traffic pointed out one overwhelming fact.  <b>The Xterra needs more power.  </b>Our XE 4x4 was equipped with the 3.3-liter, 170-hp V-6 and the optional 4-speed automatic transmission, but was still slow to get to speed, though we were able to break traction on the wet pavement from a standstill.  With the air conditioning engaged, anything resembling throttle response disappeared, and this SUV was downright sluggish.  The motor was loud, to my ears, sounding less like a willing friend, and more like it was just working to move the 3933 lb. truck around.

The ride belies this sport-ute's roots in the Frontier minitruck.  Rather bouncy, with moderate body-roll in turns, and a <i>lot</i> of fore-aft rocking under hard acceleration and hard braking, we could sometimes feel the solid rear axle rebounding after particularly sharp potholes.  The Xterra did feel like it was sprung more softly than the pickup, however, <b>tuned more for passengers </b>than for a half-ton of gravel in the back.

Cornering on the wet pavement wasn't confidence inspiring, in 2-wheel-drive.  The front end felt as if it wanted to push out, and the <b>body roll discouraged spirited driving.  </b>In 4-hi, however, cornering was much improved in the wet, as the driving front wheels tended to help pull the vehicle around the curves, rather than pushing outward.  Still, this is a small truck, not a large car, and it handles like one...autocrossing will never be the Xterra's strong suit.

The most off-road we went was the gravel driveway and parking lot of a county park, I admit.  The boingy suspension and tires worked on the deep chuckholes and loose gravel, and felt nicely compliant.  Combined with the six-cylinder's low 2800 rpm torque peak, it means that <b>this would be a good SUV to go two-tracking in.  </b>Also, it was impossible to spin the wheels on loose gravel in 4-wheel-drive.  As an aside, the Xterra has a truck's 2-speed transfer case and automatic locking hubs...a <b>true 4-wheel-drive </b>system as opposed to the currently popular all-wheel-drive systems in many SUV's.

The Xterra proved to be <b>very nimble in parking situations, </b>with a tight 35' turning circle.  It was no problem to park in a normal parking spot, and an impromptu parallel parking exercise I tried was fairly easy to do.  However, low objects disappear beneath the high, flat hood while still some distance away, making it difficult to judge how far away they truly are.  Visibility out the rear isn't wonderful, but is adequate, especially with the optional rear window-wiper.  The outside <b>mirrors are large </b>and square, providing a good field of coverage.

The biggest detriment that I found to the Xterra was its freeway demeanor.  This is where the &quot;image&quot; vehicle simply lost its cool.  Flogging the motor up the onramp was unenjoyable, and the vehicle simply did not want to exceed 65 miles per hour -- in fact, I was unable to get the Xterra to go 70 on a slight incline without bluntly mashing the gas pedal down.  This sport-ute is also <i>mightily</i> affected by the slipstream from semi-trucks.  The Xterra was buffeted around on its compliant suspension like a kid jumping on his parents' bed, and though the tires never felt like they would actually lose their grip, my wife &quot;thought we were gonna die,&quot; as she put it.  Neither an autocrosser nor a freeway vehicle is the Xterra.

Which brings us to the price.  The XE 4x4 we tested was loaded with options, like the $1,299 &quot;Power Package&quot; of cruise control, fabric door inserts, map lamps, power mirrors, power windows, power door locks, security system and remote keyless entry; the $999 &quot;Utility Package&quot; of front and rear auxiliary 12V power points, 6 ceiling clips, rear wiper, first aid kit, retractable cargo cover, tilt steering, tubular roof rack, tubular step rails and front variable intermittent wipers; the $599 alloy wheels and the $1,000 automatic transmission.  Optioned out like this, the Xterra's $20,749 base price climbed to <b>over $25,000, </b>quite a lot for a vehicle which Nissan claims &quot;isn't a leathered-up cruiser and isn't a toylike pretender,&quot; to quote their Xterra brochure.

Overall, we liked the Xterra more than we thought we would.  It's a scrappy-looking, moderately small sport-ute with a goodly amount of passenger and cargo space, easy parking manners and a decently compliant ride.  Give it a bunch more power and the Xterra might be truly &quot;X&quot;citing.  (Okay, so I haven't made a pun on the name until the very end, I have to get credit for <i>that!</i>)<br><br>
