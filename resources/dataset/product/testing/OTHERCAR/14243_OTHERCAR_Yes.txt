            I bought my 1999 G20T in september .
I've had complimentary loan cars even when i brought my car in and said my speaker rattles.  being relatively young (23) i seriously thought about lowering my car and putting exhaust or turbo.. as the car only is 140 hp... everyone i know said that would be a waste.. as the g20t is a a very nice and above all, classy car...  Another friend marveled at it's impressive brake power.. and another said it was a very comfortable ride.. infiniti g20t commands healthy respect, even from bmw and mercedes owners... and though it may not look like the most advanced and awesome concept car, it still has a certain charm and sporty classy look. I hate the cup holders.. a joke... and while there is a sense of coldness in the lack of simulated wood for the interior.. side airbags.. front airbags, micronair filter, automatic climate control, and a host of other luxuries more than makes up.  You may complain about the horse power or the price.. but what is the goal of the g20t?  entry into luxury at a price we can afford.. and the g20t does it with class. I own one and like the slogan.. i understand.<br><br>
