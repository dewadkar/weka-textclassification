            This is my second digital camera in a week.  The first was returned and I decided to try this cheap camera out.  At first I was pretty skeptical.  I had just paid $200 for a 2.0 megapixal camera with very poor picture quality.  I thought that there was no way a $99 camera could out perform it.  But i thought it was worth a try and so I decided to go with the cheap Kodak over the Cannons and Fuji's that were two to three times the price.

Initial reactions:

When I opened the camera and held it for the first time it felt very fragile.  It seems like Kodak didn't put it together to well but for $99 it was what I expected.  I feel like that this camera won&#146t take to much abuse but I&#146ve dropped it once from about 2 feet from my bed and there is no sign of any damage.  So maybe I&#146m wrong.  But I would definitely not recommended this for someone who is traveling a lot or hiking or anyone who doesn&#146t take good care of there things. I then installed the software that was pretty easy, put in the batteries and I was ready to go.  

Pictures:

After running through the regular run of the mill stuff (date, time, etc.) I was ready to star taking some pictures.  This thing is really just point and shoot, no fancy features or anything.  It&#146s really a barebones camera.  Which some people will like and some people won&#146t.  I wish it had some more features but for what I am going to use it for it just fine.   The menus are really easy to use and scroll through.  Adding the flash is quick and easy, you don&#146t have to scroll through endless lists to find it.  Also deleting pictures is a snap with this camera.

The picture quality was amazing.  I had just returned the Casio 2.0 megapixal camera because the pictures were terrible.  This camera is $100 less and the pictures are 10 times better.  I was really amazed.  These are the best pictures I&#146ve seen from a 2.0 megapixal camera.  Takes great pictures both indoors and out.

The movie feature is so so.  I wasn&#146t buying this camera for movies but I messed around with them and they are alright.  Nothing I would consider when buying and digital camera.  They don&#146t skip at all, but they are short and worthless.


Complaints:

The thing I didn&#146t like the most on this camera was no lens cover.  Again this could be problem if you travel a lot of are a backpacker.  I bought a case to fix this problem but it&#146s a little annoying to have to put it in the case so you don&#146t have to worry about the lens.  Also the LCD is not very clear and it&#146s really dark.  But what can you expect from a cheap camera.  Picture quality is what matters.  Also Battery life is awful.  I used the included batteries while I waited for my rechargeable ones to charge.  And after about 2 hours they were dead.  Rechargeable batteries are a must with this camera.  They are only $20 extra.  Also there is not to much onboard memory.  I would recommend buying a memory card.  I got a 64mb for $40 and it help a lot I couldn&#146t imaging using this without it. 

Pros:

Price.  For $99 bucks you can&#146t go wrong, but expect to pay about $50 more for the batteries and memory (but this is expected with almost every camera).  The picture quality is amazing for the price.  Best 2 megapixal camera in my opinion.  Also easy of use.  You don&#146t have to spend and hour or two thumbing through the manual just to figure it out.  This is a definite plus for anyone who has trouble working with technology.  In my opinion a great camera.
