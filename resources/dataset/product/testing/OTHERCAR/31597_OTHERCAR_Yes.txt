                 Let me get something out of the way.  What everyone wants to know�but are too lazy to go to the manufacture�s web site to find out.  That is the features of the camera.
The CoolPix 800 have some of the best features that come in its price range.

The Nikon CoolPix 800 is one of the best 2.1 megapixel cameras out there.  It has the choose of either Automatic recording or Manual recording where you change  settings manually.  The Manual settings will let you do some extreme shooting, from extremely dark environment (like a moon light shot) to a bright high contrast picture (white car on an extremely bright day near the shade, where the car that would normally be washed out). The price is very reasonable (around $450 at the current time).

	I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants to get into taking digital pictures but has a tight budget.  I really love this camera and wish I had the money for the new Nikon CoolPix 990, because Nikon knows what they are doing in the area of digital photography.  I owned a Casio digital camera and the Nikon beats it ten fold.  The battery lasts a long time even with the LCD on.  I recommend getting NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger, which you can get for about $30 at KITS Cameras.  I am currently working on a web page for the Nikon CoolPix 800, but it only deals with content not design.  If you want an informative web site visit: http://ns2.nerpnet.com/~work/nikon and drop me a note about what I can add onto the site.  mike@mail.nerpnet.com...Thanks.<br><br>
