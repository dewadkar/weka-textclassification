              It has been a very good car, as far as reliability and performance.  The body styling and interior styling are terrific.  The car has awesome engine performance and hadling capabilities. Out of all of the Honda's that were put out during this era, the Honda Prelude is by far the best!  It is a great car for compact performance.  The handling makes it easier for one to really feel like they are driving a high dollar import sports car.  I have added 16&quot; rims and low profile tires that have enhanced the performance of this car, even more than when I first purchased the vehicle. This car is perfect for anyone looking for performance out of a automobile for a low cost, the car is amazing for being a 10 year old car!  Anyone that is looking for a roomier car should not perchase this car.  There is definitely limited space in this car. I would recommend the car for someone between the ages of 18-26.  This car has been extremely good to me and I recommend it!  <br><br>
