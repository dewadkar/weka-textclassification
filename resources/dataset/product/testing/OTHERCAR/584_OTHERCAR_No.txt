            Probably not.  It's not sexy.  But it is utilitarian.

The Suzuki swift is a small car, kissing cousins with the likes of the Geo Metro, etc.  Some of my friends have even compared it to a golf cart.  But they stop laughing when I pull into parking spaces no one else can fit in and they are left circling and circling looking for a spot.  This is a serious thing in Los Angeles, where I drive my Suzuki Swift.  It's size makes parking a breeze in a city with nightmarish parking.  It also makes changing lanes easier because I don't need as much space between the cars soon to be ahead and behind me.

The exterior is pretty plain and simple, and the photo provided here on Epinions pretty much tells it all.  The front and rear bumpers are pretty big, but they aren't going to be any help against an SUV, which is most of what is out on the road here in L.A.  Because of it's height, when one hit me it went right over the bumper and crunched the car.

The interior is also simple, but it has a few frills you might not expect from a car of this size and price.  Mine has a cupholder, which is a must for a commuter.  It as an AM/FM radio with presets and the speakers provide reasonable sound quality.  It has front and rear windsheild defrosters, which I consider and important issue of safety.  It has spacious door pockets, which are great for maps (or trash, let's be honest).  It has A/C and heat which both get cranking very quickly and the car is small so it cools off or heats up in no time.  

Other plusses are that it has daytime running lights and strong brights, and it handles very well.  Some of the canyon roads here in L.A. are so windy you feel like you are in a driving video game, but this car can handle the curves with no problem.

The car is a hatchback, and with the backseat up for passengers there is room for a large suitcase and a couple of smaller items in the trunk.  With the backseat down there is a ton of room, and seat raises and lowers easily.  I find hatchbacks like the Swift are also good for dog owners, because with the backseat down there is a lot of room for the dog to stretch out while you drive, and you aren't getting dog hair all over the seat where passengers will later sit.

So what isn't so great about the Suzuki Swift?  Like I said, it's not sexy.  The steering wheel can really work your arm muscles toward the extremes of it's turning.  There are no automatic windows or doorlocks, which is a pain.  There is no cruise control, which you never get to use in L.A. traffic anyway, but to those of you in other areas could be a bummer.  It accelerates well in 35MPH city traffic, but on the highway it is another story.  It takes this car many seconds to get up to 50 or 60MPH, which often makes me uncomfortable when I am merging onto a highway.  The engine doesn't have overdrive, so around 60MPH it starts to sound like it's struggling.  I am too worried by the way it sounds and feels to push it past 70.

Basically, if you are looking for an inexpensive, utilitarian car for driving in areas with speed limits below 55MPH and fits into non-existant parking spaces, the Suzuki Swift is a great way to go.  If you are looking for a car that makes you feel sexy, purrs while you drive it, and holds it's own at the speeds of the Autobahn, look elsewhere.
