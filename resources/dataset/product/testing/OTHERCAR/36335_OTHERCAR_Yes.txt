            I have had my Celica for 4 years now. It's a 1991 GT model and it now has 160.000 miles on it with the original engine.
I bought the car because I wanted a sporty car and I really liked the looks.
It has been very reliable, I have not had any major problems ever since I have had it. The ride is comfortable even on long trips and the acceleration is pretty good.
I get about 26 miles to the gallon driving a mix of city and highway traffic.
The only problem I see with this vehicle is the lack of space for passengers in the rear. We did manage to travel 3 hours with four adults but the people in the back did not exactly love it.
Buy this vehicle if you want reliability and a sporty car at a good price.<br><br>
