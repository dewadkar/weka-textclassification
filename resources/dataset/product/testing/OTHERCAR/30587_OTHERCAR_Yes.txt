            My wife and I don't consider ourselves the &quot;minivan&quot; type.  What is that, you ask?  You know... the un-stylish, ho-hum, middle-age types who have left their youth and their individuality so far behind that the words &quot;fun to drive&quot; are not even thought of.

Okay, we're really not that snobbish.  However, the thought of driving a minivan never crossed our minds until we had a baby.  That's when we realized that 2-door 300ZX just couldn't handle the new baby seat, big bag of baby &quot;stuff&quot;, extra toys, the stooping and bending required to put all that inside the car, etc.

We looked at all the minivans on the market for the 1995 model year.  We did not like any of the designs except for one: the Odyssey.  Why?  It had 4 swing-out doors!  That was so cool!  We had looked at all those other vans with sliding doors, and the thought of yanking those open and slamming them shut just had no appeal for us, not to mention the fact that there was (if I remember correctly) only one sliding door per vehicle back then.  In short, it was very easy to get in and out of the Odyssey.  

The Odyssey proved to be agile, easy to drive, somewhat zippy (even with only 4 cylinders) and fun.  We're past 90,000 miles, with no mechanical pitfalls.  Oh, and did I mention it has been FUN??<br><br>
