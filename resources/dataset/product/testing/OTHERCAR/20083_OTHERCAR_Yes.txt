            I have been a Mazda man since my very 1st new car purchase in 1985, Mazda GLC.  It was my college car, I drove it hard and retired it with over 150,000 miles on it and still sold it for $1500...

After college, I went back to Mazda and got a '90 MX-6 and promptly put 145,000 miles on it in 2 yrs...Once again, I went back and got a '93 MX-6(what a ride!)...Then came familyhood, got the MPV mini-van...Then in '95 we got the Protege...All of these were new models i have purchased...I have also had another GLC as a beat around car and a 1989 RX7 convertible...

I rarely let any of them warm up, just start and go,  hardly ever actually get the oil changed on time and I drive them hard and quick...
They have always stood up to me and performed as a true champion...Very minimal, if any maintenance other than the oil changes...

I am a firm believer in their products and we are now in the market for another mini-van and guess which dealer we are looking at...MAZDA!!!

I have played with the Miata, but at 6 '2 and 250 it is like an elephant on a pogo stick, a little small....<br><br>
