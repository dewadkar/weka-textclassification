            When I purchased the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom camera in May of 1999, It cost a total of $330. This model of the Powershot has the following features:

- 5 image storage modes: CCD Raw, 1024x768 high quality jpeg, 1024x768 medium quality jpeg, 512x384 high quality jpeg, 512x384 medium quality jpeg
- 8 MB compactflash memory card (stores 4 CCD Raw pictures, 174 medium quality 512x384 pictures, 37 high quality 1024x768 pictures)
- serial interface to computer (w/Windows &amp; Macintosh software)
- RCA output to television
- 2&quot; LCD preview screen with 15fps refresh rate
- panoramic assistant mode
- 28-70mm zoom lens
- uses CR-232 battery or rechargeable battery available from Canon
- night scene mode (2 second exposure)
- various other exposure settings
- automatically compensates for tungsten, fluorescent, sunny, and cloudy light
- picture preview mode with ability to manage photographs
- thumbnail picture preview mode
- slideshow capability on the camera
- etc

Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera, as far as it being a casual, fun camera. It cannot compete with any basic, traditional SLR cameras, but it will do a good job for situations where capture of moving objects and ability to function in bad lighting conditions is not such a big deal. A good photographer might be able to compensate for these losses, but one might as well use an SLR camera using real film for the same price for such photography. What is this camera useful for, then? If you want to be able to take quick photographs, instantly edit which ones you want to keep or throw away, put them on the computer, and the perhaps the web, in a couple minutes flat, without all the cost and fuss of regular film, then this is the camera for you. Either this one or the Powershot A5. I intend to get another camera (a Canon Elan IIe) to compensate for the qualities that a digital camera at this price level just can't provide.  <br><br>
