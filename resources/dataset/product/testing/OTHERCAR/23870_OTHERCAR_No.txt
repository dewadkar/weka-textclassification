            I should start by saying I really liked this car when I bought it and still like the overall styling and handling.  I bought my 1992 Honda Accord LX Coupe new in October of 1992.  Coming off a 1978 Jeep Cherokee (first car) I wanted something that did not gulp fuel and would run forever without requiring many visits to the shop. 

I should stop and note for the first three years I owned this car I kept the miles off of it but still was keeping up the required service as per the owners manual on a time scale.  For the final year I piled on the miles and did not notice as many problems.  

About six months after I bought the car I noticed popping sounds coming from both doors in the rain.  Several visits to the dealer had them calling me a liar and I &quot;was just imagining&quot; the noise.  Later after a test drive in the rain; the service manager called for the replacement of all the weather stripping.  About this time the dealer installed window tint began to peel and bubble on most every window, drivers window in particular.  The service advisor told me he could not tell the tint guy what the problem was because the service advisor only spoke English and the tint guy only Spanish, I hired my own translator.  The dealer told me all of this was due to Honda glass not being able to handle tint.  A  tinting shop near my home told me their was a large build up of glue that should have been washed off, this tinter replaced the tint without further problems.

While all this was going on I started using a different dealer in my area.  This dealer replaced the fuse box, power window motors (both doors), rear seat latch, rear seat seat belt retractor (recall), Airbag wiring within the steering wheel,  Starter (two times) and the weather stripping again.  The weather stripping was now tearing apart due to rubbing on the door frame.  Apparently the frame of the car was sagging and both doors no longer fit into their frames.  The weather stripping would eventually be replaced six times on each door.  

At 22,000 miles the engine block developed a crack and was replaced under Honda warrenty.  During its two week repair the interior was stained, upholstery ripped, and body dented and paint damaged.  I found out later I was improperly charged for items that should have been included in the engine block replacement such as valve adjustments.  

Other problems I noticed was a air conditioner that could not keep the interior cool even set on max settings.  I kept the exterior waxed with top rated wax but at the end of ownership the paint was very dull looking.  The interior was easily soiled due to its light color yet would get too hot due to large windows and black dash.

Due to dealership performance and overall number of problems with the car I found the ownership very unpleasant.  Others I have talked with praise Hondas, I seem to have found the bad one.  I was happy to trade it after a guy ran into me nearly totaling it in 1997.  

If you would like more info on the dealerships I visited with this car please feel free to email me.<br><br>
