            I like the Neon.  It's come a long way from the little wind-up car it used to be.  The 2000s look sharp, and could run with the likes of other econo-sport sedans like the Ford Focus, even the Cavalier.

I bought the two-door '99 R/T Road and Track edition about six months ago, and everything's smooth so far.  The R/T (no R/T for 2000 so far, sorry) comes with the souped-up 2.0-liter, 150-horsepower engine, a performance manual transaxle, A/C, power windows/door locks and sunroof, fog lights and remote trunk release (options may vary, naturally).  I've taken it on road trips up the coast, in rush hour traffic, down to the Blockbuster, day and night, hot and cold, it runs smooth at any speed, in any weather, and I haven't seen the temperature gauge budge once.  Torque is negotiable; if you're starting on an incline, it'll get you up without any trouble.  It won't beat many cars off the starting line, but if you're racing in a Dodge Neon, you're an idiot.  On the other end, it will take you up beyond comfortable freeway speeds (rather quietly--they've greatly reduced engine/road noise) without shaking to pieces.

Mechanically, I've had no problems as of yet.  I've only put 9,000 miles on it (with requisite oil changes, these are a MUST), but at the least I know it's not a lemon.  The engine is powerful for the size, the transmission is easy (don't know about the &quot;performance&quot; part), the interior is simple yet comfortable, everything is well laid out.  Dodge has included a lot of details for for the money; the sound system is good, the instruments (it comes with a tach, for all you gearheads) are easy to read, the steering wheel and shift knob are even leather-wrapped.  There's a remote trunk release, dome and trunk lights.

The drawbacks are that it's still small.  If you're big, you may want to look elsewhere.  The back seat is comfortable for two people of average height and build, but taller folks will want to sit up front.  I can't tell you how routine adverse weather will affect the Neon; I've only driven it in California.   The trunk is rather small, the stock stereo looks stock, and the tiny glove compartment isn't lighted (while the visor mirrors are--how's that for priorities?).

Still, it's fun, it is zippy, it's safe (dual airbags, steel door beams standard, ABS available), it's surprisingly equipped for the price (I paid about $16,000 new after incentives and add-ons, taxes and license).  It's reasonable to insure as well...  The R/T is a relatively rare model, and they aren't currently being made, but if you find one with reasonable mileage on it, I'd consider the purchase.<br><br>
