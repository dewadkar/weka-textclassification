            I am fortunate enough to have a boss that loves ultra exotic cars, and...he lets me drive them! Being a former Porsche Cars North America employee I am kind of partial to his Porsche collection. So when he gave me the opportunity to drive his AWD Turbo S... I was gone before he could say "have fun!" Not only is this car a twin turbo but it's the coveted "S" model, which means more HP, better brakes, and slightly different styling. Upon entering the "S" I gracefully slid into the hard, carbon backed seat and sank in it's plush leather, Porsche crested version of a luxury racing chair. Wow! This car is business. I moved the chair into a good position for some heal toe action and away we went. 
       Immediately I'm surprised with it's docile nature when driving at a slow pace. It's not choppy meaning there is no "On-Off" feel to the acceleration-deceleration and there is no turbo induced surprise kick-in-the-pants (at least while driving it mellow). But this is not what this car was built for...so at the next light I decide I'm going to see what 3.7 sec 0-60 feels like (yeah right). The light turns green and I stomp the go pedal and release the clutch! O h   m y   G o d! It revs so fast that it's bouncing off the rev limiter which sounds like pop-corn....popopopopopo, before I can even shift into second. I get it into second and it's hard to decide which gage to watch, the boost or the rpm, about the time the boost gage starts moving the tach needle is climbing so fast that's it's time to shift again. 3rd gear three to go and already north of a 100mph. I slow down, reset the over-boost light (which is a funny feature given it's on more than the blinkers)and gather my enthusiasm. So now I know what to expect, now I know that I have to shift quickly or I'm going to be bouncing off the rev-limiter. So I decide to head to my good friends work, he owns a older Porsche 911 and loves Porsche's and has never driven or been inside a Twin Turbo so I figure I'll give him a taste. His company is at the far end of a long abandoned, newly built road..."Of course I'm going to take advantage of it!" So this time I'm ready...I hit the go button (gas pedal) and before the pedal even bottoms out I'm having to shift into 2nd, and then a split second later, 3rd...then a few seconds and then 4th...145mph; now it's time to test the grippers. Three quarters out....call the ball...roger ball...I slam the brake pedal to the floor! The car catches the first arresting wire and we land..uhh I mean we stop in an amazingly short distance. It felt like landing on a carrier deck. So I get to my friend's work and he comes out smiling from ear to ear, and that's before I told him to drive. He gets in the driver chair and away we go. Same thing...popopopopop, bouncing off the rev limiter. I tell him that he needs to shift ultra fast, so he learns that right off. Then he decides he wants to see how well the AWD and traction control work so we hit a 90 degree corner fast and we break traction at the rear...no worries, staying on the gas which is important, you can feel the torque transfer to the front wheels and the car just pulls you straight after a few feet of drift...AWESOME! These cars are amazing. You could hang with any Ferrari (which I've driven too)any day of the week and still drive the thing from LA to New York and not have the slightest worry about it. We did manage to test some of it's top end speed to the tune of 165mph, which came in 5th gear, still 1 more gear to go but we were running out of road. At that speed it is amazingly docile, and tracks the road with zero wandering. Without a doubt the funnest car I've ever driven.
