            A great car.  Great, razor-like handling, and reasonably quiet ride.  The prior G20 was consistently ranked in the top three &quot;best handling front wheel drive sedans in the world&quot; and is based on the European Nissan Primera sports sedan.  Superb brakes and silky transmission (5 speed).  Reasonably roomy for a sleek, small car for 4 people as back seat too narrow for middle passenger.  I looked at other makes and the G20 has one of roomiest trunks in its class.  Many thoughtful amenities.  It's like a BMW 318 for $4500 less, with lower insurance and lower maintenance costs.  The only negative is that the car is a little underpowered. If only it had about 30 more ponies.  It really deserves more power to really epitomize the Infiniti name.  It's passable with a 5 speed, but the automatic version is about as peppy as a Sentra.  It is an utterly smooth engine, and winds up like a turbine (read FUN).  Horsepower aside, from all research I have done, the drive train is indestructible.  I have cloth, but suggest leather due to its ambience, though cloth cooler in Memphis summers and keeps your backside in place, thanks to the generous seat bolstering.

There are after-market suspension and engine parts available if you want a boy-racer version.  The suspension is fine, but I would tweak the engine, the same from Nissan's very much acclaimed SE-R.  Infiniti's slogan of &quot;Own One and You'll Understand&quot; is pretty accurate.<br><br>
