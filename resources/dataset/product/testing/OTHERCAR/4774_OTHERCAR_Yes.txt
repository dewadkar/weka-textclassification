            The 92 S10 that I had was an excellent truck. It had the small 2.8L engine, was a 5spd, but had a lot of towing capacity. My Dad bought a 20ft Bayliner boat a year after he bought the truck, and it was surprising that such a small truck could haul such a large boat. We hauled everything in the S10, and I got it in 95 from my Dad. 

Pros:
The visibility was awesome in the truck, you could see everything out of the cab, and the side mirrors were somewhat oversized, adding to the overall visibility. The small 2.8L V6, which was closer to a 4 cyl was not terribly fast, but was able to haul much more than you would think. The sliding glass rear window was a nice feature to have. The stereo was fairly decent for a standard factory stereo. The transmission was solid, however the shifter was a little on the long side. I owned the truck up to 70K miles, and it had no major problems aside from needing a new muffler caused by putting our boat in the water every week over the summer. The tailgate was wonderful, when let down it had almost bucket seats because of the dimples in the tailgate. This made it great to let down and sit on. The truck was somewhat on the shorter side as trucks go, but also added to the overall handling. It handled extremely well for a truck, better than any other I've driven. The brakes were great, they stopped on a dime. The truck also handled very well in the rain. We put some Dunlop tires on it, and it handled in the rain just like it did in good weather. The seats were a standard bench seat which I thought was comfortable. Overall it was a great truck.

Cons:
This should probably be a short section, Chevy did a wonderful job with this small pickup. The V6 2.8 was more like a four cylinder than anything. Chevy made a 2.5 4 cyl for the S10s, but opted for a small and large V6 for a few years as well. The 2.8 lacked acceleration power. It was very hard to get up to speed at times. The clutch was long, making it very hard to learn how to drive it, and also difficult when trying to shift fast. Also, the regular cab (like I had) is just a little too short on the headroom, and the seats don't go back far enough for taller people to be comfortable. Other than that, the truck was great and had no problems.<br><br>
