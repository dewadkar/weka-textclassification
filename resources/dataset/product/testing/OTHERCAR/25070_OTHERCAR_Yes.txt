            I had previously owned an Olympus 2.1 megapixel with limited functionality.  What I found was an easy to use rangefinder type camera that is great for both home and business. You can hand this camera to a 5 year old to take casual pictures or use the bracketing function for beautiful prints, up to 11 x 14.

I've used this camera in countless lighting environments and it's performed wonderfully.  

Even thought the 4800 comes with a lithium ion battery, its design is proprietary and you should buy the back-up battery and charger package.  It recharges the battery in less than 45 minutes (you'll need it).

Make sure you get at least a 64mb card, preferably the 128 mb option.  If you take high quality pix, you'll be able to store around 128 photos with the 128 mb.

If you are a casual to serious photographer, and have decided to take the plunge into digital photography, this would be a good selection for you.
