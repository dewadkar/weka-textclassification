            SAAB has its share of fans and foes, but this car really has won me over.  I recently purchased a saab 9-5 SE, and it is very impressive.  I am a huge saab fan, all the way back to the old saab 900's, and one of my favorite cars that I own is a 93' saab 900s.  After seeing the new saabs recently after they were restyled, I was sorely dissapointed, but I decided to go test drive this new model a few months ago.
THe first thing I noticed was the space.  The space in this car is much roomier than I expected, and the back seat its very roomy.  My son and our dog fit easily back there, even with his child saftey seat.  The trunk fits everything in it, from luggage to Christmas presents.  Another bonus is this car's luxury features.  The cd player, heated leather seats, tinted windows, and wood finish are all very attractive.  Another huge bonus of this car is thegas mileage.  Some cars, such as a BMW 740 or a Lincoln Nabigatior may consume gas in a mile of hours, but this car doesn't guzzle like the others.  The only downfall of this car is the sound system, which is a little weak compared to that of a dodge viper or bmw 540.  
*Bottom line - If you are looking for an afforable, very luxurious ride, definately check out the newer saab 9-5's.
