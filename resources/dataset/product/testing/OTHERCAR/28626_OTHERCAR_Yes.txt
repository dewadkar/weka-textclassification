              I bought this truck not only for working purposes but for its looks. I have had all kinds of problems with this one.#1 it gets awful gas mileage. #2 the brakes are constantly wearing out. [5 sets to date]. #3 the transmission had to be rebuilt at 60000 miles $1400.00 . #4 The pistols on the brakes calipers had to be replaced,AND rotors. There is a loud ping noise from the back when driven backwards off a slop.
  I could go on and on. I have visited the auto parts store so much they know me by name. OH I mustn't forget that when you need parts for this one ZZZZZzzzzz You better be ready for alot of phone calling and mostly dealer pricing! 
  I will strongly advise anyone to PLEASE stay away from this vehicle.
I have owned many used and new vehicles and this is my First DODGE and it will be my LAST!I never had this much problem with a used vehicle.nor have i spent as much money on repairs.
  It has huge side mirrors, but it only adds to blinds spots which it has a few.
                DODGE THE DODGE<br><br>
