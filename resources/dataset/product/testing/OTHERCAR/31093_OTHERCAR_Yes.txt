            I drive vehicles for a living.  If I had the money this would be the truck I would buy.  I drove it for 91 miles and felt like I was in a luxury vehicle.  Even the drivers seat was comfortable.  I was amazed at it's ability to move quickly with out the feeling of being too big.  The back seats were manageable for small children.  Getting into the truck was simple even for all 5'4&quot; of me.  Toyota has hand grips to help and they work wonders.  I have a few disabilities and it was a snap getting in and even easier to slide out.  Drove like a dream.  I don't think I would ever tire from driving this vehicle.<br><br>
