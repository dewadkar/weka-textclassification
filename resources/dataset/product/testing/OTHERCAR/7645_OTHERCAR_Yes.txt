            My wife had a 2-door 1998 Saturn that was getting a little hard to get in/out of (our age).  She liked the sporty look and the small car feel but the small back seat of the 2-door made it difficult for her to transport her friends to the weekly domino game.

She decided any new car would have to have 4-doors, be small, handle well, and have an automatic transmission.  She wasn't interested in luxury features (e.g. leather seats, sun roof, etc.) for some reason.  We decided to explore:
Chevrolet Cavalier
Dodge Neon
Toyota Corolla
Saturn Ion
Honda Civic
We excluded the Ford cars because of the quality complaints we had heard.

We started over to the Saturn dealer because that was what she was familiar with, but on the way we passed the Mistubishi dealer so we stopped there to see what they had and found the Lancer.  She wasn't enamored with the OZ model on the showroom but was shown the LS and ES models on the lot.  She liked the ES styling and we test drove it.  Both of us liked the ride and the pickup.  Rear seat leg room was a bit better than expected.  Some engine noise but less than her Saturn.  Seemed to shift very smoothly and turn on a dime.  The sticker price was reasonable and comparable to what we expected.

We then went to the Saturn dealer and looked at the Ion in the showroom.  My wife just didn't like the interior; particularly the instrument panel and the rear seat leg room, so we moved on to the Honda dealer.  The Civic was nice except a little less rear leg room and a little more expensive than the Lancer.  We test drove the Civic and liked the handling and the pickup.  The engine seemed a little noisier than the Lancer but the pickup was about the same.  Still a little road noise but these weren't luxury cars.  We looked at the Toyota Corolla and test drove it but the quality seemed a little lacking, especially in the interior.  The Dodge Neon and the Chevrolet Cavalier just didn't make the cut due to price, quality and handling.  The selection came down to the Civic or the Lancer.

I went on line to find out more about these two cars and was surprised to learn Mistubishi was offering a $2000 rebate on the Lancer!  We went to the Mistubishi dealer and negotiated a $13,500 price for the ES with the Convenience Package option (rear-fold seats, floor mats, keyless entry, etc.).  The best Civic deal we could get was nearly $2000 more.

We drove the Lancer home and since then our initial feelings about the great handling, ride, noise and roominess have been confirmed.  It fits in the garage nicely; smaller than her Saturn.  She noted her exterior rear view mirrors fold back to make it easier to transport the trash can; but then I showed her my Lexus mirrors do the same.  My wife loves the car and comments how easy it is to drive and turn.  Can't say much about gas mileage yet because we're still on the first tank of gas.  

I don't know whether ABS on the Lancer would dramatically help the stopping distance in an emergency, but I can say the brakes work very well and stop quickly with the light car.  Skidding could become a problem but with the Lancer's great handling characteristics, it might be easier to overcome.  I was very glad I had ABS on my Lexus one time but then again it's a heavy car with a lot of momentum to overcome.

We've only had the Lancer for a month so take that into consideration.  I just had to provide an early comment since she is so pleased with her Lancer.  I'll add more later after we drive the Lancer a while.

Update 12/15/03:  After driving the Lancer for a while, I can confirm the great handling and acceleration. You can turn on a dime.  The ride has turned out to be a little harder than we first experienced.  The road and wind noise is much more noticeable and I'd suggest to Mitsubishi that some sound insulation would be very helpful.  Even though we have remote door locks, you still have to open the trunk with a key.  That's a little awkward when you're carrying groceries.
