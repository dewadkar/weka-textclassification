            This is our second mini-van (2 Teenagers, 2 dogs, and lots of extracurricular activities make a mini-van a logical choice for us).  We purchased it for three main reasons: 

1) Our 8 year old Caravan was getting very tired.
2) We own a Honda automobile and it is the most reliable vehicle that we've ever had.
3) We had an Opel van for a while when working over in Europe.  The Opel had folding rear seats (split 50/50) and we found them to be just a fantastic feature.  Mazda also makes a van with a folding rear seat, however the Mazda was under powered and had trouble getting out of its own way.

We have put almost 2500 miles on the van so far.  What I really like about:
1) The Driving experience.  OK, its not a sport sedan, but it handles better than any other van I've driven.  Lane changes and turns at intersections are crisp, with not too much body sway.  Acceleration is quite good, ...no problems passing on two lane roads.  Shifting is very smooth and quiet, in part due to the 5 speed automatic.  
The layout of the controls is good: gauges are easy to read and controls are easy to find.  I like the radio/CD volume/switching controls on the steering wheel for safety reasons.
The driver seat is quite comfortable and supportive.  I have some lower back problems, however I have been able to log a 600 mile trip with no trouble.
2) Size.  This van is big on the inside.  It comfortably holds people and stuff.  Its also pretty big on the outside, so you have to be a bit careful when parking. 
3) Features.  The van came with a bunch of features I was looking for, as well as a few I wasn't concerned with, but like now that I have them.  Standard features with the LX that I was looking for include cruise control, luggage rack, floor mats, mud flaps, CD player, rear heating and A/C controls, the folding third seat, and dual sliding doors.  
Other features that I find very handy include the tray that goes behind the rear seat (it caught juice from our Christmas Turkey that ran out of the package, making cleanup a breeze), the hooks behind the third seat to hang those flimsy grocery bags from and keep stuff from falling out, the rear power outlet for the kids portable CD players.

OK, some features I can do without.  Most notably, the power sliding doors.  They are just plain counter-intuitive.  If the car isn't in park, they just beep.  If the door locks are engaged, they just beep.  If someone pulls at the handle at the same time the driver uses the remote open feature, they just beep.  Ugh.  Unfortunately, in order to get all the really neat features that the LX has, you get the power doors also.

Now for a few other complaints.  Overall, these complaints are minor, but they are real.  
1)  The Odyssey is noisier than I expected.  Its quieter than our Caravan was, but not as quiet as our Honda automobile.  Both wind noise and tire noise are greater than I expected.  If it is particularly windy outside than the driver and front seat passenger will hear a constant whistle when driving at highway speeds.  I am going to have the dealer look at this to see if it can be improved on.  
The tires also seem to create more noise (I call it highway whine) than I expected.
2)  The stereo speakers sound very tinny.  The treble overwhelms the base.  Very good for Alvin and the Chipmunks songs, but not so good for anything else.  Playing with the bass and treble helps, but only a little.  These speakers are quite a step down form the ones in our Honda automobile.
3)  The hood drops off and is hard to see when parking.  Our caravan had a cheesy hood ornament on it, but it sure made it easier to judge when parking.
