            My brother just brought a new 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. I dont usually like SUV's I think they are two lane wide huge gass eating machines.  The Pathfinder has many of the qualities, but it also has so much more that I find impressive. This is a true luxury ride that is expensive but has many qualities of an automobile that could cost twice it's price.

First thing to notice is the incredible layout and inner cab design of this automobile. This is a very plush and stylish interior yet it has incredible comfort and design.  While the Pathfinder is a large SUV it is not nearly as large as lets say a Navigator and such.  Yet this automobile has as much luxury and room as any automobile I have ever seen.  I am sure that the Navigator has more room for stuff, I doubt that it has more room for each passenger.  THe interior leather is also very nice.  It is plush and cushy.  I could see this feature being a true aspect to enjoy on a long trip.  Your back wont ache after many hours of travel in this luxury SUV, you will be relaxed and enjoyed.

The drive is also a very impressive sales point for the Pathfinder.  You are so high up while driving this machine that the driver feels like the king of the road and able to conquer anything.  I am sure that this is true with any SUV but the Pathfinder does it with style and does not have the effect as being as clunky or chunky as other SUV's.  The 240 Horsepower engine is also impressive.  It does very well with the smaller lighter SUV frame that the Pathfinder has.  It drives almost as if it were a sports car.  This thing can really move in an impressive fashion.  While I do not recommend it, I think this SUV can beat many cars in a road race, WOW that is impressive.

The interior is really something to write home about.  IF you equip this vehicle right you can get a very trendy combination of colors, such as silver lights and a black interior or whatever you choose.  The sound system is a 6 disc cd changer with a Bose surround sound.  The speakers are placed so the driver will get a surround sound style of entertainment, it is very impressive.  The wood panel is also very attractive with a fine wood finish and all the clocks and electronic buttons one could ever ask for.

The only real problem is the fact that it cant elude being an expensive SUV.  With gas prices being as high as they are across the country I could never invest in an automobile that only gets 12 miles to the gallon city, and 18 miles highway.  That would be a full tank of gas around every 200 miles.  That is a big investment in my opinion.  Your gas bill will almost be half the car payment, that is ridiculous.  Still this is one nice SUV if you can swing that kind of drain on the wallet.  IT is also a 30,000 dollar automobile, this is not a cheap car that will cost under 20,000 dollars by any means.  I find this to be a big investment if you have the cash.

I also tend to trust the Nissan name. My family has had Maxima's and Altima's in the past and they have been wonderful cars.  They do not require much maintenance, and the service has been nothing but superb.  THe Nissan family of cars has a wonderful feel to them and they tend to be some of the best car for the money.  THey are not the cheapest but quality never is.  I think the Pathfinder is a wonderful vehicle I just do not understand the SUV craze myself.
