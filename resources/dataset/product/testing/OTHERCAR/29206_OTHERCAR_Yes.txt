            I went to Orlando, Florida in mid-November and rented a 2002 Dodge Intrepid. We were offered a Geo Metro, but I decided to go with the Intrepid for obvious reasons. At first glance, the car looked big (I usually drive a Buick Regal GS) compared to my Buick. I have to say the styling is unique, you definitely won't look like every other car sitting in traffic. Keep in mind, I rented this car for 6 days, I don't own one...yet ;)

COMPLAINTS

First, I'll start with my only two complaints. First complaint is the rear end. The first thing I noticed about the rear end was the liftover height to get my 75 lb luggage in the trunk. Much easier to put that stuff in the spacious back seat. I'm 5'9", average height and build. When I backed out of the parking spot at the rental place, I noticed the rear end was so high it blocked my rearward view. That makes for one heckuva blindspot while backing up, parallel parking, or even merging onto an interstate with heavy traffic. I got used to it in about 3 days of driving it though. My second complaint was the a/c. I'm from Illinois and I expect cold weather in November. When we landed in Florida, it was 87 degrees. So I turned the a/c on max...and waited...and waited...about 3 mins later the a/c got cool and in 5 mins the cabin finally cooled off. I've never had a car take that long to cool off. The rest is praise...

INTERIOR

Inside of the car was pretty nice. It was a base model, so it wasn't luxurious. Had cloth seats, white gauges (which looked cool at night and were very easy to see in dark and direct sunlight). The seats were pretty comfy and supportive, felt like they'd be easy to drive a few hours in. Controls were in easy reach, not awkward to get to and the stereo sounded ok- I've heard a lot worse in more expensive cars. Another review on this site said to get the windows tinted- he was right!! it about drove me crazy after 5 days, I'd definitely get it done if I owned the car. The interior was also very roomy. I didn't feel cramped at all. The trunk swallowed our large, bulky bags with ease. I didn't spend enough time with the car to say any more about the interior...

ENGINE

Let's start with the engine. It's got a 2.7 V6, not sure about the specs. It felt pretty solid, quiet, didn't sound thrashing like some V6's I've heard. In town it does pretty well, keeps up with traffic. When you have to merge, just lay into the gas, the transmission downshifts to 1st, let it rev past 3000rpm, and the V6 takes off. The car is pretty quick when the engine revs despite its mass and smaller V6. I had the car 6 days, only filled it up once (I only used 3/4 tank of gas, but if you don't fill it up the rental place charges like $4/gal if they fill it). 

The car was very quiet- engine, tires, and road/wind noise. I constantly found myself going 85  because the car didn't seem like it was going that fast. The transmission's overdive let the engine cruise at 75 at 2300rpm, which is pretty good. It felt like a quiet, solid car. It handled very well also. I felt confident taking corners and interstate exits at high speeds, usually doubling the speed limit. The car took it all in stride. I can't tell you how the car will last the road, but the build quality seems better than my Buick. 

CONCLUSION

Only having 6 days' experience with this car, my review doesn't show any long term pros or cons. It only took the first day to realize this was a solid, quiet, capable car. It only took a week for Dodge to convince me to buy this car when I get the chance. So, when I'm looking for a car to replace my '97 Buick Regal, the first car I will look at is a Dodge Intrepid. Whether you drive highway miles, or in-town, I believe this car is quite capable doing anything you want it to, whether it be hauling groceries or hauling 5 adults. I hope this helps!!
