            The New 2000 Volkswagen Jetta is an outstanding car. It's roomy, comfortable, affordable, and easy to drive. Everything in the new Jetta, is unbelievably amazing. I needed a car that got great gas mileage, that is somewhat inexpensive, easy to drive, and comfortable. The Jetta was it. I love the way it handles, and how it drives, it's so smooth. The sound system is outstanding as well. When you're in the Jetta, everything is so quiet. I'm speechless trying to explain the Jetta, it is just such a wonderful car, it's just amazing. Everyone can drive this car, it's so easy. I recommend this car to everyone who can drive.<br><br>
