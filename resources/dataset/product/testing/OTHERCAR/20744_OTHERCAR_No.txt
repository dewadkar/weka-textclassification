            I bought my 2 door, 4 wheel drive Blazer because I live out in the country and needed a dependable vehicle in bad weather. It has great power and and is really nice inside. It has all the up to date features, as in air controls and radio. 

It is really easy to drive but seems, to want to turn over in sharp turns like most sport utility vehicles do. Compared to the explorer it is not all that roomy inside. I wished it had more room inside. Mine has only 2 doors which brings the biggest thing I dislike about it. It is extremely hard to look out of the back of it. 

With the added tire on the back it is even harder.But the overall handling of the vehicle is great. The one thing I love most is it has plenty of power. It has a 4.3 liter v6.I recommend it for anyone who wants a small suv with enough power. Anyone who wants it as a family vehicle may want to look at an Explorer which has more room. Overall It is a good vehicle.<br><br>
