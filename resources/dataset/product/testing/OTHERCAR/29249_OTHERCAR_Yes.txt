            I bought the car in 1995 after trading in my Jeep Cherokee Limited.  In 1999, I bought a Durango and gave the Blazer to my son.  Now, he can't have a car at college, so it sits in our driveway for when he comes home.  It is really a great car - I bought it for $27,500 in 1995, and it is the longest I have ever kept a car - 7 years.  Now, that it is pushing 100K miles, I am thoroughly impressed with this truck.  It still looks great (Paint shines and the Grey leather is still in excellent shape) and appears to be only a couple years old.  I had some tranny problems while it was under warranty, and now when I am backing out of my driveway sometimes, I hear a clunking sound.  I took the car to a couple of places and they couldn't find the problem.  I'll wait it out and see what happens down the road.  I plan to run the car into the ground, which might take a while.  I do recommend this truck!
