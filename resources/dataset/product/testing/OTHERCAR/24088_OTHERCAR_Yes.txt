            While it is an inexpensive camera, and doesn't have many bells and whistles, this is a great camera for kids - and one that mom or dad won't be embarrassed to be seen with either!

My parents got us one for christmas for several reasons:

1 - they wanted us to be able to e-mail pictures to them
2 - I wanted a digital, but wasn't willing to spend big $$
3 - our 4 year old is constantly asking to use our cameras

I don't mind letting our kids use any of our cameras with the exception of my SLR, but is gets expensive, and to be honest, most of the pictures aren't worth keeping.  I had been hesitant to let our daughter take pictures with my 35mm because of the cost of film and developing, so this ws the ideal solution.

We purchased extra memory, so even at fine resolution she can take about 20 pictures before having to start deleting.  At that point we bring them home and download them to the computer - and the power adapter is worth purchasing for this, as the camera is a bit of a power hog.

All told with power cord and extra memory we spent about $150, which we feel we've already recovered in film costs.  As our daughter gets better at taking pictures, we may need to ate to a better camera, but until the, this is a great deal.<br><br>
