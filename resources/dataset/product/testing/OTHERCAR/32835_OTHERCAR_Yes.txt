            Back in 1996, my soon to be husband and I were looking into getting a new car. We needed something practical and reliable so we went to our loyal Chevrolet dealer.

When we got to the lot, I fell in love with a teal green Chevy Cavalier. It was a 1995, so it was used, but we were assured by the salesman that it was in great condition and that it was only used as a rental.

After financing the car, we had our wedding planned for the following week. Things went swell and we even took the car down to New Jersey from Connecticut to go to Six Flags. When we returned two days later from our trip, I was driving to the post office and the car just decided to stop running. I managed to pull it to the side of the road and luckily enough it was only a short walk back to the apartment that we were living in at the time. My husband looked at the car and realized that the fan belt had broke.

We managed to have the car towed to the dealership and they had to fix it. When I went to pick up the car they informed me that it was going to cost me $60.00. I was a little preturbed about this because they had just put a new fan belt in a couple of weeks prior to the incident and wondered why it had broken so quickly. They told me that the confetti that our friends had thrown all over our car got into the engine, creating the fan belt to break. I paid the $60 and walked away an unhappy customer.

We kept the car for another two years, not really having any more major problems except for replacing the brakes.  We never really totally loved this car either, it did not have any of the power features that we wanted and it didn't even have a sunroof. The only thing it was good for was getting back and fourth to work and the fact that it could hold about five passengers with some comfort.

My days with this car were finally over, one early spring day when I believed another driver and crossed the street. I was hit by another driver and the car was totalled. I am thankful that no one was hurt badily, but I am not thankful to ever have to drive that car again.
