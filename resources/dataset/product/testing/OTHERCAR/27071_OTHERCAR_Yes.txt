            Are you looking for a good reliable set of wheels that won't send you to the bank looking to make payments for the next five years?? Maybe you're looking for a second car or a car for your teenager who's raring to get their drivers license? I highly recommend that you keep your eye out for a Mercury Tracer.

I own the 4-door sedan model shown in the photo above and have been more than pleased with its performance over the last six years. My wife and I purchased our Tracer when it was 1 year old and had 12,000 miles on it. It had been an rental car and we were shown all of its records so we knew that (other than oil changes, etc...) it had never been in the shop. In 1994, we purchased our Tracer for $7,000.

Over the last 6 years, we have put 80,000+ miles on it and have had it in the shop only three or four times. While a couple of the shop visits were for tune-ups, we did have to have the rear-suspension coils and shock absorbers replaced which cost us around $600. The only other visit occurred at about 70,000 miles when the air conditioner stopped blowing cold. The shop determined that the A/C manifold had rusted from the inside out and that repair cost us another $600.

That's it. For 80,000 miles (and still going), we paid a total of around $8,000. In my book, that's an excellent deal!!

As for features, our model (the base model) has AM/FM Cassette, Automatic, rear window defogger, A/C, child-safety rear locks, cloth interior and that's just about it. Windows, locks, seats are not automatic and I really don't miss it. The car is small enough that reaching back to roll down the window  or unlock a door (while I'm stopped) isn't a problem. 

The cabin is, however, spacious enough that back-seat passengers have plenty of leg room even if the front seats are pushed back. In addition, the rear seats fold down to expose the trunk area so long pieces of cargo can be carried by feeding them through the trunk into the rear seat area. We even hauled a pre-assembled entertainment center in the back.

As for performance, the car gets around 25 miles to the gallon in the city and has enough zip to get me around without feeling like I'm driving a lawnmower or a golf cart. The lightweight frame does get blown about by the wind on the highway above 70, but not anymore than any other car in this class.

Overall, I am very pleased with the Tracer. I have known several other people who have owned them and had similar experiences so I would highly recommend the vehicle to others. I sure hope that my Tracer holds out for another 50k-60k miles and if it made it to 200k, it really wouldn't surprise me.<br><br>
