            im 17,this is my first car. my parents bought it for me i had no choice. but still,im glad to have a car. its had about half of what we paid for it worth of work done to it,but hey that what happens when you buy a used car,you neve rknwo what youre getting.the speakers absolutely suck,and we tried to replace them,but to do that witht he front ones  you have to rip the dash out. whats with that? its pretty small,(but mine has 4 doors) which makes it alot of fun to drive. its a stick but its only got 4 speeds. its got air which is great, alot of weird quirky things about it. no cup holders which really blows but ive managed to fit my slurpees between the seat and the E-brake. oh and the breakes are squeaky as hell. i hate that. id recommend this car for anyone,its great for new drivers like me,despite all the time it spent in the shop,but its all good now!!lets see... ok room in the front,but cramped in the back<br><br>
