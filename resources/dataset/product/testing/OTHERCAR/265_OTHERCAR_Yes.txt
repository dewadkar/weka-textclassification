            <B> 2.1 Megapixel </B>
This is so awesome, you wouldnt believe the resolution you can get on this camera. When I upload the pictures onto my computer and view them, they are larger than my screen itself and Im running a very high resolution on my computer. The pictures you take, if done correctly will come out very crisp and professional.

<B> QuickTime Movie Mode </B>
I haven't really gotten too much into this. But this feature allows you to make a movie from either 23 seconds to 193 seconds depending on what size SmartCard you are using (read more about SmartCards below). You can upload these and watch them on your computer or even send them to family and friends. Great for keeping long distant family members in touch.

<B> 3x Optical/9x Digital Zoom </B>
This camera is great with zoom. You can zoom in using a button of the top of the camera, take the picture and then view it on your LCD screen 3x's closer.

<B> Weight </B>
This camera is so light weight, perfect for anywhere you go. This camera comes with a little strap, good enough to put on your wrist. Personally I like the ones that go around your neck. They are very easy to pick up at any camera store or the internet, and they just slip right on to the camera. 

<B> Storage </B>
The camera does not come with any storage, I do recommend buying a small camera case. Soft or hard covered would be fine. I like to keep my camera's safe and without a case surely I would break my camera much faster. 

<B> Add-Ons </B>
NI-MH Batteries with Charger - I bought one of these and love it so much. Its an ultra high capacity battery with a very fast charger. Fits right into your normal outlet and holds 4 batteries. All 4 batteries will charge up in 210 minutes. I think this camera sucks up batteries like crazy, so buying this really helped to cut down the cost of me buying batteries all the time.

SmartCards - The camera comes with an 8MB card. Personally that was too small for me. The 8MB only held around 16 pictures, the 16MB holds 31, the 32MB holds 64 and the one I use, the 64MB holds 128 pictures. Depending on how many pictures you want to hold on your camera pick the right smartcard for you. Also the smartcard MB will determine how long your movie can be as well. 8MB will hold a 23second movie, a 16MB will hold a 47 second movie, a 32MB card holds a 96 second movie, and lastly a 64MB card holds a 193 second movie.
