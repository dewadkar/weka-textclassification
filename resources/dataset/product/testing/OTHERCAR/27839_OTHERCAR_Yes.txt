            If you really cannot afford a BMW 528i today, put it on your wish list and start saving.  When you can finally get one, you will be utterly glad you did.

Now, some people may see a $50,000 car as an impractical extravagance.  A BMW 528i is neither impractical nor extravagant.  This car is comfortable, very safe, and a pleasure to drive.  Power and handling are more like a sports-car.  Comfort and convenience are extreme, with intelligently automated assists for most functions.  I especially like the electric seats allow a highly customized feel and a memory-setting for three drivers.

Because it maintains its value well, a three year lease is relatively inexpensive (as a percentage of the retail price) compared to lesser cars.  So, once you get beyond the sticker-shock, you'll be happy you chose to get this car.
