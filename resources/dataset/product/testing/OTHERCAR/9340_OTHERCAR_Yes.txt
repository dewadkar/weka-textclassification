            Great car!

I commute from 120 to 300 miles each day in the congested SF Bay Area.  I find the car extremely comfortable, I can see over traffic, and it is as quiet and rides as well as my brother's Mercedes E420.  The sound system beat out my Mercedes C230.  The seat warmers are a must.  And, to top it off, the car looks great!!!

The suspension system is incredible!!  Anyone who has driven across the San Rafael-Richmond bridge will testify to the impact of concrete panels on the ride of any vehicle - Baboomp, baboomp, baboomp.  The other day I crossed the bridge, my LX470 was in Sport (tight suspension) mode.  I decided to test the system, expecting only a slight improvement.  I turned the suspension to comfort setting, the baboomp, baboomp, baboomp,...turned to silence.  I couldn't believe it, so I turned the suspension back to sport and again heard the familiar baboomp.  After that I turned back to comfort and enjoyed the rest of my trip across the bridge with a little wicked smile of disbelief.

After driving a Mercedes C230 for business for 4 years, I needed something with more comfortable seats, space, and something that could see over traffic.  Well, I've found the car for me as long as I will work (I still have over 30 years before retirement).  The seats are wide and comfortable with an adjustable arm rest that lets your arms rest at the same level, whether you have your right arm on the middle console (low), or your left arm pinned on the window sill (high or at any level you desire)- an obscure feature, but a feature that addresses a pet peeve I've had about most vehicles (most armrests are not even on both sides). 

The recirc feature on the air conditioning does not block smells as well as my Mercedes (you could pass a dead skunk and smell nothing), and I've found that some touchless carwashes do not have dryers tall enough to completely dry the vehicle. Wah, wah, wah.  Obviously, my gripes are extremely minor.  

I bought this car used.  For those on a budget, you can get an LX470 in great shape with higher mileage for about what you'd pay for a not so great new Ford Explorer.  Odds are, your Toyota engine will far outlast the Ford.  Besides, wasn't it Ford who apologized for making SUVs?!  

NO APOLOGIES FOR THE LX470 !!!!
