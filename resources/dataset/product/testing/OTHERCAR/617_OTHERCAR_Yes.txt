            I just bought my Nissan Sentra two weeks ago and i have not had one problem with it since.  It is a dark burgandy with no fading whatsoever which is great for a 96.  It has every option  imaginable and its a manual what more could u ask for.

Interior:  The interior offers plenty of legroom even for those of us who top out at over 6 feet.  I have plenty of space while driving and even when i get in teh back for fun i have decent room.  The gauges are layed out rather nice and are easy to read especially at night.  No model comes with leather but the cloth seats hold together well and are virtually stain proof.  The carpet is a little cheap but a decent set of floor mats can fix that right up.  The shifter and shift knob are located in a great spot and are very easy to reach.  I dislike the fact taht the cup holders are right in front of the knob b/c when shifting they tend to get in teh way.  Make sure you drop the stock radio and put in a cd player but the stock system otherwise is bumpin, i let my bass hit hard as mess and still haven't blown the 8w speakers even when my cd player sends 45 a piece.  I love the fact taht i have all power, including a sliding moon roof which is great.
Exterior:  The exterior has the occasional rounds but does still show some boxy parts which is normal for the year.  The paint that nissan used is top line and will not fade under any condition.  Bumpers and sideskirts are very tough and not made of plastic like other companies.  If you can find one with a stock spoiler then get it b/c it brings more of a sporty side out of the car.  
Engine:  The 1.6 L 117 horsepower engine is adequate for the car but i would have liked to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 135 to make the car run nice, which i have fixed by dropping in some mods.  The engine and trans are running strong and have never failed on me, it seems that the trans is totally against stalling as i have never stalled yet and just learned a week before i bought the car.  

Overall:  If you are looking for a dependable car that will not let you down and will last forever!! then the nissan sentra is for you, i have heard reports of these babies going past the 300,000 mark as long as they are maintained well.

So keep good care of this one and you willnot be disappointed.
