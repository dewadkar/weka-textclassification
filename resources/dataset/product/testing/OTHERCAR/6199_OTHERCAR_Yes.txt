            This is my second digital camera so I knew what I didn't want.

I always wanted to be able to work a digital camera like I do my 35mm to create shots that have my personal touch to them. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this camera does in fact have everything I wanted and had come to expect from 35mm photography.

For comparison purposes I did some shots with the Kodak DX4900 on a tripod setup and identical shots with my professional 35mm setup. I selected one shot from each and had both enlarged to 16"x20". A good friend of mine is a prodessional photogropher. He compared my results to his professional digital camera prints and was surprised that my results looked equal to his, considering that he spent thousands of dollars for his camera. 

The best part was that when I set the camera to the automatic settings, my 13-year old grandson was able to take excellent picrures. My grandson's camera expertise is as basic as it gets. He is purely a point-and-shoot teenager. We downloaded his pictures to my computer, cropped out all the junk with seperate photo editing software that I like to use, and now he has pictures he is proud of. 

The photo editing software that comes with the camera is very basic and too limited for my interests, but then, I have photo editing software that I am happy with so I merely download my pictures, edit them as I like, and can either print them from my computer/printer, or put them on a CD and have the camera shop print them for me. Either way, my pictures are GREAT!  My 35mm camera hasn't been used since I started using my Kodak DX4900.

Taking extra flash cards and batteries in the camera case is always advisable, just like I would take extra film and batteries with my 35mm camera. 

The docking station is wonderful. It keeps my camera fully charged all the time and obviously, in the same place all the time so no last minute hunting for where I put the camera last. The docking station is small enough to take on trips and doesn't need to be connected to a computer or printer to recharge the camera -- just needs an electric outlet. I have also used the cigatette lighter plugin to recharge the battery while traveling.

I LOVE the whole setup and have not even bothered to see what other NEW technology is out there to replace what I already have. 

Thanks, KODAK, for simplifying my life!!
