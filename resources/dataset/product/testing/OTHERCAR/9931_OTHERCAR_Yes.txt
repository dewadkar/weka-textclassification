               I purchased this car new way back in 93 when it was first re-designed. I have to tell you, when they bought this car out for me to test drive they knew they would hook me! I will never forget exploding on to the highway at 100 plus miles with power to boot!! And the swirl sound of the quiet engine, sounded like it had a gas turbine in it!! And  all the bells and whistles that came with LS model placed me high on the playa's list with the ladies....
  First impressions lasted for 5 years with car, I was amazed at it's reliability as routine maintenance was easy for the do-it-yourself types and expensive for the "take it to the shop types." I can think of only 3 maintenance items that have given me problems: Brakes- routine, CV boot covers- routine, and a little electronic box that would cause the engine to idle very low causing it to shut down. This is over the course of 5 years, good I think. The last 3 years have been sort of hectic with this car. It is now 8 years old and soon to be 9. The powered window controls stopped working and a replacement switch is over 200 dollars! Plus it was time to get routine maintenance; timing belt, water pump at the 60- 100,000 mile mark. Right now this car has 123,000 miles on it and I still consider it to be very reliable despite the little things that go wrong at the 5 year mark; sunroof sticking, alarm blinker, door limit switch failure, ect; all related to hardware issues.
   The styling was unique at the time of purchase, and everybody wanted to know what kind of car was it. The sound system was good too, the CD player and audio controls were good at the time of purchase. Will I recommend this car, as a used one? No only purchase new unless you are a playa on a budget.
    Another area that is lacking is the paint on the body, it faded away to the point of no return. I ended up getting a new paint job that sort of brought the life back. And don't even think about getting to adults to sit in the back seat! Personally I consider this a 2-seater. I don't think I would purchase another one but I will recommend it.
