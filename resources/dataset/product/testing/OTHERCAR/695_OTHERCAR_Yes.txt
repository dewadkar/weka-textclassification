            I am not a professional photographer but needed a sturdy, easy to manage digital camera to use for taking photographs to put up on web auction sites.  I hesitated for several months, analysing several cameras and finally, based on a MACWORLD review, opted for the coolpix 950.  It has worked great. I consistently have been able to take closeups of jewelry, even able to focus on minute stamps indicating the carat weight.  It has also worked well with general shots of art and antiques, allowing me to capture details and very importantly to alter the flash speed to remove problem hot spots.  Taking closeups with a flash that did not have this feature would have been impossible,but the coolpix has been great. I especially like the small size.  I am not thrilled about the instruction manual, but that is typical of many technically written instructions.  Too much jargon and not enough basic instruction, which is why the company included a small folding paper basic guide for users.  I am pleased with it and if given a choice, would buy it again. <br><br>
