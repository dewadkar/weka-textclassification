                 My wife and I bought a Saturn SL1 in December of 1995 for $11,900.  The car was used, but it had been driven only 8,591 miles at the time of sale.  This was our first car bought together as a young married couple.  We thought we had gotten a fair deal. The sales department was wonderful.  They guided us through the no hassle, no bargaining sales regime painlessly. 
   For the first three years the car ran great. We only needed to take it in for scheduled maintenance.  It ran great, that is, until the warranty ran out.  The first problem occurred in February of 1999.  The check engine light came on and we brought the Saturn in for service.  On that visit the ERG valve and serpentine drive belt were replaced. No problem.  The next problem occurred in May of 1999.  In this instance, the car would not start.  We took the Saturn in and had the alternator replaced. No problem. Alternators go out on cars.  Thank goodness we did not have any trouble until the next year.
     In April of 2000 the Saturn needed new brakes. No problem.  Brakes need to be replaced.  Three months later the car was running rough. Hesitating and surging at lights.  The ignition coils and wires were replaced.  No problem.  We did not have any more problems in 2000. 
   In February of 2001, the real Saturn problems began.  The Saturn would periodically not start.  When the key was turned nothing would happen. We brought the car in and the starter was replaced. Again, no problem.  Well there was a problem. It did not fix the problem.  A week later the car stranded my wife, my mother, my sister, and me in a parking lot 5 miles from home.  We had the car towed to the Saturn dealership.  The next day the service department could not figure out the problem. At least they did not try to replace some random part of the starting assembly.  The car started eventually on its own.  I was the only one brave enough, or dumb enough, to drive the car.  The good news is the car has not left us stranded because of not starting.  The bad news is the transmission went out on the car in August of 2001.
   I understand that transmissions can go bad, but this Saturn had exactly 57,194 miles.  This is unbelievable.  I took the car in to the service department.  Saturn service replaced the valve body, but it did not fix the problem.  The service department informed me that I had two options.  Pay over $4,000 for a new transmission or pay $3,000 for a used transmission with 54,000 miles.  When I informed Saturn that it is unreasonable for a car with 57,000 miles to blow a transmission they offered to give me a $10 per hour reduction in the labor. They were not joking.  Nine days later after dealing with the Saturn dealership and the Saturn Corporation, they offered to install the used transmission for $2,200. I went to the sales department for help.  I thought since the service department could not take responsibility for the defective Saturn, maybe the sales department would act more responsibility.  They offered to give me $1,600 dollars on trade in.  At this point, I decided to take my Lemon, I mean my Saturn, over to the Toyota dealership. Believe it or not the Toyota dealership offered me $1,800 on the trade in.  To add insult to injury, the Saturn dealership made me pay $384.99 to retrieve my car.  I did not even get to keep the new valve body.  I am now enjoying my 2001 Toyota Camry. Even though I do not enjoy another 3 years of payments.  Thanks in part, or in whole, to the Saturn Family.
