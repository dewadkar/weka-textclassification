                I bought my Trans AM in the fall of 1997 and I've been in love with it ever since. I purchased the fully loaded model and most of the accessories are never used, but might come in handy someday.
    Super v8, with awesome road control and acceleration make this a true sports car.The air and power everything with the most comfortable front seats I've ever ridden in make this a true luxury vehicle and the go anywhere at anytime mentallity it allows me to utilize make it a true all purpose vehicle.
   The only drawbacks I have ever had with my &quot;Big red machine&quot; is that I have been told that the rear seats are not to comfortable and the leg room back there for anybody over 5 feet tall is non-existent.
   With 50,000 miles I can honestly say that there have been literally zero mechanical problems or even hints of them. Of course that is with proper maintenance.
   I think they must have even used a stain resistent carpeting on the floors as even in these muddy Wisconsin springs and Autumns the spots are removed with little effort.<br><br>
