            I live in New York City and I was driving in the Bronx NY, going up a steep Hill and a Ford explorer (Eddie Bauer Edition) was driving next to me going up this hill and my KIA Sportage EX 1999 fully loaded with 5 passengers total including me the driver. My KIA went up the hill with out trouble, The Ford SUV with only a driver in the car, with the RMP very high, was having trouble getting up the hill. So bigger I not always better, the car KIA Sportage EX 99 is great on fuel and you have the option to change the setting to economy on or off when driving. Cruise control is great and the black model with 2tone gray is a real head turner, I have received so many questions from people on the road about this KIA.

So I feel that the KIA is a great Buy with all the extras and leather seating, a little bumpy on the road but great handling. Great sound system. My KIA is 3000 mile young and I only had a flat, caused by a construction site on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.

So I can say I have a great car. Love the 4 WD KIA EX 99... love it
