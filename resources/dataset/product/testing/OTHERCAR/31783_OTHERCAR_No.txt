            <b>Intro</b>
Considering this camera has already been reviewed a number of times, I'm going to skip the specs and go right to the pros and cons. I got this camera as a gift in December 2002.

<b>Pros</b>
Takes a good picture in optimal conditions.

Easy to learn and use. PC software is decent and also easy to learn and use.

<b>Cons</b>
The camera is easily fooled if the lighting isn't optimal (and sometimes even when it is). I find the picture is often under or over exposed, so I have to try it with both lighting options for the shots that matter.

Camera is very slow under the high resolutions. There will be a lot of lag, which makes candid or nature shots difficult.

Quality of the image is not to great under close scrutiny. As I enlarge the pictures, they have a strange 2D quality to them. And this is at the maximum resolution of the camera.

Redeye occurs often, even with anti-redeye on.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I found too many flaws with the camera to recommend it, but maybe I'm expecting to much from it because I used to have an SLR and I miss it. 

As for battery life, I gave it average but this can vary greatly depending how you use it (elect. viewfinder, flash, etc.).

To give it some credit, the camera saved the day at a birthday party where no one had film. I was able to shoot the party, and the pics printed fairly well on 4x6 at the local photo lab. Because of some lag in the camera under low light, I missed a few shots.
