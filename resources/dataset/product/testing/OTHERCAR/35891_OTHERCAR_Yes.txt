            Well, I just bought this car yesterday, and picked it up today(<i>After the dealer "certified" it</i>)
And even after the first test drive - I fell in love with this car!!
Let me say that again, ...<b>I love this car!</b>

It does corner like you wouldn't believe! - it feels like it drives itself sometimes.
When i bought it it was in really good condition considering the mileage it already had on it, the interior is almost spotless (<i>very well made I must say,compared to other cars I have been in</i>)
The first owner must have taking really good care of this car - how can you not with a car this sweet!?

I'm 5'11, 150lbs, and it feels like this car was especially made for me,I get in and out with no problems 
everything can be adjusted nicely to my needs,and I truly feel in total control behind the wheel.the controls are a little getting used to but placed very well. 
I love the fact that it is a hatchback too, if you have alot to throw in the back - all you gotta do is put down the back seat(s)<i> so cool that you can split them 50/50</i>
and you have ALOT of room for the trunk - I think I could actually sleep in the back with the seats down - gotta try that next time I go camping!

This car is very user friendly,its a Sport Coupe so driving in the city is perfect, you wil have no trouble getting the parking space.
the turning radius is amazing! you can cut U-turns with ease.

So far I've had my car for about 6 hours, 
Nothing has gone wrong!, haha 
I have been reading all of the reviews here, and it has helped with my decision to buy a 97 Tiburon - thank you

This is one of the best cars I have ever been in, I still cant believe that its sitting in my driveway as i type this!!
Its a Forest Green colour, I like the colour alot, there were some very small marks on the paint in various spots, but only noticeable if your looking really close, 
Every stop I was at, I had people looking at my car

<b>I Love this car!</b> 
I think it could use a little more power when you first hit the gas pedal,and I just wish that the gas cap didnt completely screw off, so i have to hold it in my hand when I fill it up with gas.
but thats such a small little detail - hope you liked my review :) 

If i ever experience any problems, I will update my review
STAY TUNED!!
<b>UPDATE</b>: My car has now developed a transmission problem at 182,200 km. I now have it in the shop, and hope that its just a sensor problem and not my tranny.
I will update when i hear the (bad?)news
