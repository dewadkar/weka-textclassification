                 A relative of mine recently purchased a slightly used (5,000 miles) 1999 Hyundai Tiburon for a little under $10,000 and in my opinion it was worth every penny.

     The car is very stylish for a compact vehicle around $10,000 and the interior is even better.  This is the perfect car for a person to take on a long trip because the interior is comfortable enough to sit on for hours on end.  It also gets good gas mileage (29 mpg highway) which also makes it a great drive for a trip.

     It is not one of the fastest cars on the road but the 140-hp engine makes it a compact car with enough power to keep up on the interstates.  Everything else mechanically on the car runs about average with it's competitors.

     There are only a few bad points about this car.  This car was not made for a tall person, I would recommend noone over 6 feet should consider buying this as a primary vehicle.  It also isn't one of the quietest cars either.  The engine makes a little more noise then it should for a 2.0 and it rattles and shakes a little.
   
     Overall, I give this car 4 out of 5 stars as it is one of the better compacts on the market.<br><br>
