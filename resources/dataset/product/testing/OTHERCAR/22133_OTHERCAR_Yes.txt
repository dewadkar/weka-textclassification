            Ever wonder how people get those great looking pictures on their web sites that take so little file space?  Well...the answer my friend is MEGAPIXELS!  With the Kodak DC215 Millennium 2000 edition you get just that, GREAT pictures.  Forget scanning your photos, forget those video capture devices that drop 50% of all video taken (and produce horrible quality pictures, believe me), go DIGITAL, and settle for nothing less than a megapixel.  The Kodak DC215 Millennium edition digital camera has great features including: macro, date stamp, frames (fro framing the picture before you even transfer it to computer), review (to see you photos on the LCD, with zoom in feature).  Buy yourself some Kodak glossy paper and you'll be printing photo quality pictures from your inkjet printer.

Features on the Millennium edition that are not on the standard edition: gold casing, 8MB compact flash card, and the most important feature (which you should not live without!), the SanDisk USB card reader for extremely fast file transfer!
