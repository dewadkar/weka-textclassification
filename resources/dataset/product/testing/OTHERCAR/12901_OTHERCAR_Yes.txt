<TEXT>
            The Volvo S70 is a great car with too many great features to even compare them to the small amount of bad things 

      The good stuff
   a larger interior than one expects
   very comfortable seats without being to soft
   very comprehensive driver controls, unlike the Mercedes where I hear there are more than ten controls just for the drivers seat
   solid construction and feel which is sportier than the old Volvos, 240
   sharp lines reminiscent of older models (which I really like) without being to boxy
   simple design which is carried forward in the driving experience
   a crisp and close to the road driving experience
   very responsive and aggressive
   extremely safe

      The bad stuff
   the trunk doesn't always open with the remote
   the seat memory feature which is supposed to adjust the seat depending on what key is put in, so each driver doesn't have to change it doesn't always work
   the controls for the passenger seat are kind of annoying to use
   it can be hard to turn the key, multiple attempts sometimes necessary

OVERALL
   a very exciting family car
