            While the Lexus ES300 is classified as a "Family Car", it would have to be reclassified as a family car for the elite. It is a very attractive vehicle which design is based on the Toyota Camery. It has four doors and is easy to enter with a door clearance that is adequate. It's 210 horse power 3.0 liter V6 engine is responsive and crisp, with power on demand. The ES300 by Lexus seats two in the front and three adults in the rear however they will find themselves a bit cramped. The front wheel driven ES300 operates on regular gas and offers an 18.5 gallon tank and gets about 22 miles per gallon with the four speed automatic transmission. The ES300 is 190 inches in length, has a wheel base of 105 inches, and a width of 71 inches. It is 3,390 pounds of classy ride. The 13.0 cubic foot trunk space affords ample luggage and grocery bag space. While driving to the store, or to vacation land, you will enjoy the good leg room the ES300 Lexus offers to both the front seat and rear seat passengers. The most promising thing about this vehicle is it's excellent track record for above average overall reliability for the past nine (9) years. So the bottom line is, you get what you pay for. Buy a Yugo you got a Yugo. Buy a Lexus you got style, comfort and dependability. If you got the bucks this one should be driven. Odds are you'll be driven to buy this one.
