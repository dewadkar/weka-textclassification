            I am on the market to buy my family a good all year round transportation.  I have tried all cars out there.  I also tried Ford F-150, Chevy Avalanch, Chevy Silverado LT, and Toyota Tundra Limited.  None of these trucks impressed me to spend my $45,000.00 for this vehichle until today (7/24/02).

Today is my 3rd tried for this new 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Plus Sport model.  After I take the truck to drive to show my family for an hour, I bought this truck.

The reason I make my decision to buy this truck are the Truck Good Look, Styling, Interior lay-out, Exterior-good looking fresh and bold-very handsome and Full 4DR.  If you are in market to buy a Three Cars: On-Road. Off-Road, and a Family-All Year Round Sedan, and do not have the Cast to Buy all of the three cars, Then, you need to consider this Luxuary Truck.  This Dodge RAM 1500 is the only Cartruck you need.  I was thinking to spend my hard earn money to buy a Lexus or a BMW sport cars for my family.  But these sport cars can not handle the job that I am having.  The car that meet my requirement is the new 2002 Dodge RAM 1500 Quad Cab SLT Plus Sport.  

This truck can serve me and my family all of the four seasons together; Winter, Summer, Spring, Fall.  I can go off-road and on-road with no complain from my wife.  Not a chance if you buy Lexus or BMW sport cars. They can only be able to drive in the Summer, not a chance in the Snow season in Wisconsin.  I almost make a big mistake to buying that 3-cars with my money.

I like everything on this truck except one VERY BIG COMPLAIN that I was not happy with.  The Engine Horspower.  Common Dodge!  This is a very nice truck of yours. Why only 245HP for the 6,000 pounds?  If you could only have this truck 300+ hors power, then, you are the truck Governor.  Not the Mayor in Trucksville in Tennesee.

Another thing I wish Dodge would reconsider to add to this truck for the 2003 Model are: Standard Running Board, Put the new 5.7L, 345HP to this top of the line SLT Plus Sport Model as a standard engine, Build a new On-Road Suspension/very Smooth like the Chevy Avalanch/Escalade EXT to this Governorville Truck, and an optional DVD entertaiment center and a CD/Cassette Player combo to this truck for a driver like myself who spend over $45,000.00 for this truck.

The truck that I buy today, I ordered the new 2002 Dodge RAM 1500 SLT Plus Sport with $3,553 Option Equipments and a total of $5,695 Mopar Accessories added, plus tax and license everything.  The cost was $45,485.00.  This is a total load truck.  I need everythings.  This price is too hight for a 245HP truck.  I can buy the Cadillac Escalade EXT truck with this amount.

Overall, this is a good family truck.  When will Dodge install the new 5.7L, 345HP into this truck?.  Thanks Dodge!  Good work.  Nice truck indeed!  If you need to win Chevy, Ford, and Toyota in reliable, dependable, sell leader, and range #1 in 2003, you need to correct your mistake from your customer like us and start to install the new HEMI 5.7L, 345HP, V8 into this RAM 1500.  (Please continue the 7/100 deal again, not 7/70,000).
