            Anyone who has children should own this van, and really anyone that doesn't.  The Dodge Grand Caravan is well worth the money, and the fourth door is a real bonus.  It make it really easy for everyone in the back to get in and out.  Six years ago my husband finally talked me into buying a van.  After test driving several other models we chose a Dodge Grand Caravan.  I loved it.  After driving a Grand Caravan I would never be able to go back to a car.  Two years ago I purchased another Dodge Grand Caravan because I wanted to upgrade and have more of the options.  My new van has a 10 disc cd changer, four doors, captain chairs.It has everything that I could want, and I have never been happier with any other vehicle I have driven.  It is wonderful on snow and ice.  I have never had any problems with my van.  Other than oil changes and tire rotations it has never had to be in the shop.  I really can't say anything bad about the Dodge Grand Caravan because I love mine and wouldn't trade it for any other van on the market.         <br><br>
