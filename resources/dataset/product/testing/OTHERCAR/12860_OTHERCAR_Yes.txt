            This car is strong.  The metal is very solid and has held up to the numerous &quot;off-roading&quot; experiences I've had with it.  I have also hit stationary objects, no laughing, and have never seen a problem or a mark/dent on it.  Its a big hunk of good American metal that stands the tests of a 16 year old driver, NO LAUGHING.  

The Good: Factory sound system sounds like I have incredible subs and tweeters in the trunk.  Of course, I installed a new cd player (see my review of the Pioneer DHC 1000) and it sounds great!  I have a V6, I'm not sure how many horses, but it moves when you force it to.  I drove from Ohio to Tennessee in it and it was the most comfortable ride I've been in. It has a great roomy interior and the leather is a definite plus, if it has been well groomed. Using cruise control on the trip, I got about 30 miles per gallon, there are ligher, more efficient cars that can't get that!

The Bad:  It weighs a lot, and although it never snows in Nashville, on occasions when it does, I'm worried I'm going to slide all over the place.  The driver has to have the keys in the &quot;on&quot; position in order to unlock the trunk from inside the car using the button inside the glovebox.
