            Hi Guys

This Honda Accord Sedan will soon be launched in India after a long wait by both Honda Motors &amp; the Indian public.

Long time back this was about to be launched in India by the famous group the TATA Group which got cancelled due to some reasons. Recently last year Honda deceided to Import this to India but again they did not get the permissions. Now finnally Honda Seil India Ltd. has deceided to start production of this model in India. They hope to roll out the intial models in March 2001.

Altough I had this car some years back &amp; found it really great to drive but then I sold it 2 years back as the spare parts were not available here in India and it was too expensive to always keep on importing small spare parts &amp; pay huge amounts of money for these small parts. So I sold it of for a very megre amount but then I must admit that it was a real fun to drive. I could easily sprint to 120 KMPH from 40KMPH in the same gear &amp; did not even had to think about it. So I would recommend it to you. And if you can afford it then this would be just a nice choice.

I am really very happy with this car &amp; recommend it all the Potential buyers if they can have easy access to spares. I also hope to buy it again when it is launched in India as then everything would be available here &amp; maintainance would be just NO problem.

Bye
More Later
