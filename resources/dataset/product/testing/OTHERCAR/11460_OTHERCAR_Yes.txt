            We purchased our 1995 Saturn in 1995; and the former owners had driven it the prior year as a dealer car. I love my Saturn.  I didn't always love the color of it, though.  I was 3+ months pregnant and very nauseous when my husband and I decided to test drive cars.  We went to a reputable new and used car dealer (not a Saturn dealership) for a good deal.  At the time, there was only one Saturn available, a very bright teal color.  Usually, I am the one who makes all of the purchasing decisions, especially big ones, but this rare instance I did not care.  All I knew was that I was sick as a dog; and if the guy was not going to give us a decent deal, we were going to hightail it out of there.

My husband test drove the car.  I sat in the dealership office looking greener than the car.  He came back, stated that he liked it, wondering if I wanted to try it out for myself.  Well, I had heard good things about Saturn, so all I was concerned about was negotiating a doable payment and getting out of there.  My husband, not being very car savvy at the time, told the dealer what the most was that we would pay per month.  Well, the dealer added only a few more dollars to the monthly payments, so we agreed to buy.

This is now nearly the end of 2000.  We've had small repairs along the way, but no major problems.  The rubber is coming off of the inside of the car near the door, but it is near the door that my toddler has a tendency to kick.  It is a four door, roomy enough for my family of 4, plus a friend.  The car tends to whine a little when low speeds are driven, like throughout the city, but I have been reassured by my personal mechanic several times that they can't find anything wrong with it.  It's as smooth as butter on the freeways.  The only things I would like to add to the Saturn are tint to the windows and a sunroof (the latter being a frivelous wish).  The Saturn SLX is considered a sportier model, although it looks like a regular family sedan.  It has no spoilers.  It does have the mud flaps, though.  I think that we are getting our money's worth, even right now.  The seats are comfortable.  I like the extra lumber support for tired backs.  My husband likes the cruise control.  The car itself seems to cool or heat quickly and maintain an even temperature.

But, let me tell you, I sure hated looking at that car for a long time.  My last pregnancy was rough on me.  I literally couldn't look at my new car even up to several months after delivery without feeling the need to hurl.  It's actually a pretty, yet bold, color.  I blame that on the pregnancy, though.  My only regret was not finding a gold-colored or hunter green one.  Otherwise, I consider this car a winner. And the best part of all, as corny as the commercials are, other Saturn owners do tend to come up and talk to you, because you do have something in common.  And, in my humble opinion, if you're a Saturn owner, you have quite good taste.<br><br>
