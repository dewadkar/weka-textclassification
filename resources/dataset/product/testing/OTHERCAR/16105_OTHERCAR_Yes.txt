            I leased the 2000 Grand Cherokee Laredo last year and so far nothing major, except for some annoyances. I got the upscale package with the Infinity sound system, 10 disc CD changer, sunroof, fog lights, power seats etc. The only probelm that I have is the gas mileage. Other than that the little things were fixed by the dealer, such as putting on new lug caps amd replacing the rear struts because they were making creaking noises. 

I get around 17 mpg and the truck has the V6 engine. The V8 gets the same gas mileage. The truck rides like a car, the sound system was well worth the extra cash and the spare tire, a full tire and rim, are neatly snugged away under the rear liner, unlike past Jeeps.

Despite its comfortable ride and car like appeal the Cherokee is a monster in snow and on the back roads, a true Jeep.
