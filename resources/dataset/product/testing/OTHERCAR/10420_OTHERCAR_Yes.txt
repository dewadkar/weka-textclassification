            The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful and useful automobile.  I originally purchased this vehicle because I truly need a sport utility.  I needed a vehicle which could haul some, would be good in the snow if needed, could travel offroad without getting stuck in muddy ground, that could tow a trailer and that could also haul 4 or 5 people in comfort to a movie or dinner outing if necessary.  This vehicle provides all this and more.

My Grand Cherokee is equipped with the 5.2 litre V8, the towing package, heated leather seats, etc.  It is the Limited model, which came very well equipped.  This vehicle is very smooth and quiet on the road, and is excellent for traveling on long trips.  The automatic climate control A/C is one of the best that I have experienced, and it has excellent brakes.

The only noticeable difference in driving, as opposed to a standard sedan, is that you will feel a little more leaning during cornering or perhaps a little more sway.  This is due to the tall tires and high center of gravity.  

I might add, though, that when it comes to off-roading, there isnt much out there that can compete with Jeep.  While I unfortunately have not had the experience, it is well known that a vehicle does not recieve the Jeep brand unless it can successfully negotiate the Rubicon Trail.  At least its nice to know that if you do require such a situation, that it can be done!

Once you become accustomed to this, and it doesn't take long, you will begin to realize how much all the other wonderful attributes of this vehicle overcome this minor shortcoming. The Jeep is not a truck-based vehicle, like so many other SUV's are, such as the Ford Explorer, the GMC Jimmy, and the Durango.  It therefore does not have a truck-like ride, and is more smooth and quiet like a car, because it is unibody construction in lieu of body on frame.  Unibody provides a more rigid, stable and quieter platform.

Fuel mileage figures which I have experienced ranged from a worst case of 12.5 mpg while towing a car through the eastern U.S. mountains, to 21 mpg during a trip.  Combination city / highway, for me at least, has been around 16 mpg.  The Grand Cherokee, with this 5.2 litre V8, has lots of power, which is nice when merging onto the interstates!

I have had no mechanical problems with this vehicle whatsoever after 44,000 miles of driving, other that the fact that my front rotors were replaced under a recall notice, and I replaced all disc brake pads at that time as well.  I also just replaced the spark plugs, and have changed fluids and filters(oil, transmission, etc.) as recommended by the maintenance schedule.

If you are looking for a sport utility vehicle, you cannot go wrong with a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited!<br><br>
