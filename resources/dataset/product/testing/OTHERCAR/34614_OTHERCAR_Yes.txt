            I have about 14000 miles on a new 99 GT sedan, AT, security system, upgraded sound system.

The good:
I get a lot of comments on the appearance of this vehicle. The hood scoop and spoiler make it sporty looking.
Just got to try out the all wheel drive in about 3&quot; of snow. I was very impressed. It responded well to low traction conditions. It did not behave like a 4x4. All four wheels spun together. 
Impressive handling from a firm suspension and decent tires
Very nice sound system. Clear and crisp.
Plenty of engine power considering it is a 4 cylinder. I wish I had bought the 5spd for better control.
Lots of passenger and trunk space for a little car.
With 4 people and a trunk full of camping gear, the rear end did not sag! Most compacts go nose to the sky with that much weight.
There is nothing like a 4-wheel powerslide in fresh snow! 

The bad:
I had the front axle shafts replaced because the car was shuddering during acceleration. (warranty covered it) This solved it, but it was annoying on a new car.
The steering is very stiff at highway speeds. I do not suggest this for long trips.
The engine is at about 3k RPM at 65mph. It is not too loud, but feels like there should be a better overdrive.

I purchased this vehicle for 3 main reasons:

1)AWD in snow country
2)Subaru history of durability
3)Many of the features of an SUV with better ride, handling, cost and mileage

No other manufacturer makes a comparable model. Audi is too $$$.

Who should buy?

Anyone who experiences adverse weather and traction conditions. AWD makes a huge difference.<br><br>
