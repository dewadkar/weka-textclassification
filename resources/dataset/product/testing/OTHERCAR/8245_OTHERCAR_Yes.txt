            I originally purchased the Kodak DX4900 camera and quickly exchanged it.  I then purchased the Fuji 2800 and have loved it!  I am very satisfied with the quality of pictures it takes and the ease of use.  Although the Fuji is only a 2 megapixel compared to the Kodak's 4, I feel I have a much better camera now.  The 6x optical zoom is wonderful.  I have taken so many great shots and had fun editing them with the included software (which is great!).  

This is my first digital camera, so I am still learning all the possibilities I have.  My cousin got married this past weekend which gave me the perfect opportunity to test the camera out.  I wasn't sure how the pics would turn out because of the low lighting at the reception.  However, when I got home I quickly downloaded all of them and they were all wonderful.  The built in flash made up for the low lighting.  All 166 pictures I took looked good, except for a few with red eyes because I didn't have that feature turned on (didn't realize it at the time).  But that problem was easily fixed when I edited the pics.  

The added features like video mode and voice caption are great too.  I have used these only a few times and it really makes for alot of fun.  The only complaint on the video mode is there is no light, so if you are shooting in a low lighting situation, everything is dim.  But that is what I have a camcorder for anyway!  Another complaint is the low lit lcd/viewfinder.  The pictures still turn out great because of the flash, but you can't always see exactly what you are shooting.  I just aim in the direction anyway and they have always turned out.  Even if they don't, you can delete and start over.

Overall I have been very satisfied with everything about this camera.  I plan on using it alot and feel confident I will really enjoy it for a long time.  I have not tried the web camera feature on this camera yet, but I hope to soon.  This should make for a really fun feature. I would definitely recommend this camera.
