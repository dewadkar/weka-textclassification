            Toyota 4Runner SR5, 2001

4Runner 4U

If you try to see the difference between the 2001 4Runner model and last year edition you will have to look past the exterior of this SUV. The only thing that changed with the body from 2000 and 2001 is redesigned front grill and rear-lights arrangements.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

For 2001 Toyota launched a new base model of the 4Runner. It is the SR5 V6, which has been added to the family of this very popular SUV.

The new SR5 V6 is less expensive than the previous SR5 and comes equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission instead of the manual transmission the old SR5 use to have. 

The top of the line is the Limited Edition model and it comes equipped with a full range of standard comfort and safety features. The SR5 V6 that I test drove was not as well equipped but a buyer could add many options to make more pleasing to drive.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As I opened the driver side front door I was a little disappointed by the appearance of the interior of the 4Runner. Not that anything was bad with it but the car I drove had a very drab appearance.

After taking seat behind the steering wheel and setting the seat and mirrors to the appropriate place, I noticed that the front and side vision was excellent but the driver will have to get use to the rear window vision which can be hard to judge when backing up.

From front the driver&#146s seat all the gauges are easy to see and read and all the control buttons are also easy to and reach.

The 4Runner SR5 V6 comes equipped with the following features: air conditioning, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD player and rear window defrost. I was surprised to see that power windows and luggage rack were only available as optional features.

The front headroom and legroom is excellent as for the rear seat the headroom is as good as the front but the legroom is at a premium.

The Exterior:

As bland as the interior of the 4Runner I drove was, as stylish was the exterior body of this SUV. The dealer did have the optional luggage rack and alloy wheel installed on this particular demo vehicle.

I do like the extra large side view mirrors and unless you plan to pull an extra long trailer you will not need to add larger after market mirrors.

The cargo volume space is very good at 44.6 cubic feet and the standard towing capacity is at 5,000 LBS.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Toyota 4Runner SR5 V6 I test-drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 3.4-liters DOHC V-6 motor that will develop 177 horsepower at 4,000 RPM.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: Front disc and rear drums with ABS.
Tires: 265/70R16
Safety: Driver and front passenger airbags.
            Child safety locks.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The 4Runner SR5 V6 is a good-looking SUV in appearance. I do not like the fact that it has so few safety standard features.

Aside from the difficulty of judging distance while backing up driving it within city limit was OK, on the highway it rides as one would expect a SUV to ride.
