            We bought the Mazda MPV because it offered the greatest assortment of desirable features for the price.  My wife was especially fond of the rear seat, which folds down cleverly into a recess in the floor to provide more storage space, a feature also available on the overpriced Honda Odyssey.  Other wives of our acquaintance are equally thrilled with this feature, but not the husbands, who feel that you're only MOVING the seat, and not gaining any real storage space.  They preferred the Dodge Caravan solution of actually removing the seat completely.

However well appointed the Mazda MPV is, it's still technically a new model year.  Previous versions of this car were built on the Mazda small truck chassis, with rear-wheel drive.  This year, the vehicle has been completely redesigned, with front-wheel drive.  What this means is that this is the shakeout year for this vehicle, and any basic design problems will be discovered by the buyers.

Our vehicle developed its first problem on the second day.  There's a ceiling-mounted console that includes map lights, a container for your garage-door opener, and a drop-down holder for your sunglasses.  It dropped down, but it wouldn't go back up.  We called, and the service agent told us that they've been having problems with them, and they'd replace it when they installed the roof rack that we had ordered, but which was not yet in stock.

When we took it in for the roof rack, we were informed that the new ceiling consoles weren't yet available, and we'd have to come back again for that particular repair.  When the dealer installed the roof rack, they apparently assigned the task to the worst possible installer.  He drilled through the headliner of the car, carved up the paint on the roof, soiled the interior mats with greasy footprints and failed to mount the rack tight against the gaskets that prevent leaks.

The dealer apologized and replaced the headliner in the car, painted the roof, adjusted the rack and replaced the mats.  Later, they installed the ceiling console, so everything is fine now.

This is an excellent minivan with good handling, adequate power, quiet, smooth ride, and many conveniences.  However, if I were you, I'd get all my options installed at the factory.
