            I have owned my 1993 Acura Integra 2dr LS 5-speed for about 6 months.The LS comes nicely equiped from the factory.Here is what the LS comes equiped with from the factory:
Engine DOCH 4-cylinder 1.8 5spd Transmission
Exterior Color: Red
Interior Color: Black
Horsepower: 140hp@6300RMP
Torque: 126ft-lbs.@5000RPM
Weight (lb) 2,623 lbs. 


Air Dam, AM/FM , Stereo Tape, Center Console	,Cruise Control ,Digital Clock, Fog Lights, Intermittent Wipers, Power Antenna, Power Brakes, Power Mirrors, Power Steering, Power Sunroof, Power Windows, Rear Window Defroster, Rear Window Wiper, Remote Trunk Release, Tachometer, Tilt Steering Wheel, Tinted Glass, Velour/Cloth Seats, Air Conditioning

The car is simply a blast to drive,it has no comparison to any 4 cylinder car I have owned in the past
(98Civic106hp,91CRX105hp,92Escort127hp,89sunfire98hp,
92probe132hp,94Jetta115hp,99Corolla120hp).I bought mine with 126,000 miles on it, and the engine sounds great and drives very smooth.The 5-speed is a must for any true car guy.Just add a performance dual tip muffler on the car and hear a nice deap tone sound everytime you shift.I would definetly recomend this car to any body.My model is a LS which is equiped with the 140hp engine, the GS and RS have the same engine.The best engine is of course the Vtec which only comes on the GSR which makes 160HP, I would recomend the GSR more but if you can't find one a LS,GS, or RS are just about the same.You can get lots of aftermarket parts for it, whether you want performance or just looks. I would recomend Ebay.com for purchasing any aftermarket parts, instead of going to your local parts store.For example a few weeks ago, I went to my local aftermarket parts store and asked how much Altezza Taillights would be for A 1993 Integra, and the guy said $350 dollars.The next day I decided to go on Ebay.com and found the same Altezza Taillights Brand New for $119.99 plus $16.00 for S/H and in 3 days I had my lights.I saved over $200 dollars.Ever since I buy everything for my cars off ebay.com.I just regret that I didn't think of going on Ebay.com sooner.
Overall it's simply a great car, the high reving engine has plenty of power(140Hp-126Torque LS-MODEL).If you get a chance of purchasing this car do it!So if you are tired of the 4 cylinder weakly you drive that has absolutely no pick-up or drive a gas-eating,high insurance 8 cylinder monster, then wait no longer.I only say this because I know what it's like.The 4 cylinder weakly mainly refers to the cars that I have owned in the past(see list above), and the gas-eating monster refers to my dads 1985 350V8 Trans AM.
Well thats about it, Thank You.
