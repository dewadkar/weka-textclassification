            This was the first car that I personally purchased and owned.  In 1993 it really was one curvy car that probably had the best styling in the $20,000 price range and the Sport Coupe class.  I enjoyed my car for the time I had it, but it truly was plagued with problems (I had it for 10 years!). I can only chalk up the reason I put up with it as #1 not wanting to spend money on a new car, and #2 it was my first purchased vehicle.

<b>My Basics -- Mazda MX-6 LS</b>
* 2.5L V6 Engine, with 164 HP and 160 Lb-Ft Torque
* Optional ABS
* Leather interior
* Sunroof
* Alloy Wheels
* Mudflaps (option -&gt; worthless)
* Front bra (option -&gt; worthless)
* Manual Transmission
* Rear spoiler (option)
* A/C

<b>Positives:</b>
+ I truly thought it was a sharp looking car.  Actually, I still think it's pretty sharp looking.  The Ads they were showing back in 1993 claimed the style would be "Timeless."
+ Japanese engineering - Always started
+ Trunk was actually pretty spacious
+ Fold down rear seats
+ Nice extensive 3rd brake light integrated into spoiler
+ It came with Bridgestone Potenza RE71's that were nice and sticky
+ Excellent cornering ability!
+ Driver cup holder is in an excellent location just to the left of the steering wheel up high.
+ I achieved about 17-22 mpg city, and 25-28 mpg highway
+ 6-cylinders.  Engine didn't really groan ever.  Strong pull at speed.  Difficult to achieve good 0-60 times though(see below)
+ The sport seats in front were EXCELLENT.  I prefer them to the car I own now (which is substantially more expensive)
+ In 1993, the Hunter Green Clear Coat paint was sweet.

<b>Negatives:</b> 
- The Check Engine Light came on atleast 3 times before the warranty expired and atleast once every 6 - 12 months AFTER the warranty expired

- I needed to have the Exhaust Gas Recirculation valve replaced 3 (THREE) Times!

- My Distributor cap was loose causing some malfunction of the spark plugs and loss of 2 cylinders until they diagnosed the problem and I had the spark plugs replaced (Atleast that's what I was told)

- The rubber all around the car does not stand the test of time, it peels and cracks.  Check the sunroof seal too.

- The leather seats began cracking extremely early despite using leather oils and having tinted windows (aftermarket)

- The fit and finish was average.  I actually got the 93 LS when it first came out late in 92.  Some other poor fit and finish examples were belt fasteners that were different.  Plastic tacks that easily fell out of their holes.  The glove compartment began staying partially open after 2-3 years causing the glove compartment light to stay on and shine through the cracks.

- The stereo crackled whenever I adjusted the volume quickly.

- The plastic covering the speedometer instrumentation became more translucent/foggy over the years

- The shifter would not allow you to shift back into 1st gear once you shifted out of it until you decreased your speed to less than 5 mph (probably some sort of lockout)

- The gears would have a bizzare GRIND/CRUNCH sound when shifting from 1st to 2nd in the WINTER.  This was supposedly a known problem in MX-6's and Ford Probes (same platform made by Mazda) during their first 2 or 3 years of production.

- The clutch (plate) would be very "grabby" when it was below 0 degree until the car warmed up.

- Back seat was EXTREMELY cramped (this of course is expected in this type of vehicle)

- The trunk open/close rods/pistons lost their "fluidity" and I would have to forcefully open it and close it.  Oiling would only help for a week or so.

- The electric antenna stopped rolling down (this happens with a lot of vehicles though)

- Acceleration was average.  The tough part was getting the power to the ground despite the tires.  In fact I had aftermarket 16" Rims with Z-rated tires and would still get the tires to HOP when I tried to floor it and the car wouldn't move.  I guess there just was not enough weight over the Front wheels and this is a FWD car.

- The cup holder for the passenger goes IN THE CENTER arm rest which is always filled with junk and therefore you have no passenger cup holder.  The center arm rest also is SMALL!

- No POWER button door lock.  You manually push the driver door button lock which causes the passenger side to lock.  This is a pain when it comes to installing an aftermarket car alarm as you need to get a separate solenoid.

- It began developing rust in the door hinges after about 4 years and then the doors began creaking when opening and closing.  The passenger side door (which of course got less use) began to be quite difficult to open and close due to the rust.

- Rust began developing around the spoiler attachments and some edges of the car, however, the good thing is that this didn't happen until about 7 years.  Not bad for a car driven in winter and road salt conditions in Chicago.

- Muffler rusted out and was replaced at 5 years.

- Had to replace CV boots all the way around

- The LS engine requires PREMIUM Gas

<b>Bottom Line</b>
Wow, actually typing up all those negatives makes me wonder why I still like the car.  Like I said, it was my first vehicle purchase so there's probably some sense of nostalgia associated with it.  However, to be honest, as you can see, this car was plagued with problems and with poor quality.  I don't think I had a lemon as some of the items I've listed have actually been reported as problems with Mazda Mx-6's on web forums.  Obviously, the model has been discontinued.  If it was stellar, I think it would still be around.  (Although that logic doesn't always follow -&gt; RX-7, 300 ZX, Stealth, 3000 GT, etc).

I think overall I would consider a different vehicle if I were purchasing a used 1993 car.  This car was not cheap to maintain and had all those problems (and more) listed above.

I'm surprised at the other positive comments from other epinion users but, as always, I tell it like I see/experienced it.

Good Luck!
