            There is no doubt about it looking at the competition.  The Dodge Caravan still holds the title of reigning king of minivans.  Power options up the wazoo, this is the most convenient minivan that Dodge has ever made (remember that Dodge always leads the field in minivans).  The Grand Caravan is slightly longer and better equipped than the base Caravan model, but both are a very practical size; more practical than any SUV for driving on the road.

Characteristic of Dodge products, the Caravan allows several engine choices.  Always a fan of an uplevel engine, I must recommend the V6.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the punch this van had, and I am not easily surprised.  Of course the V6 costs a bit more, so it's a matter of priorities.  But if you're torn, go for it.  A V6 can be very rewarding.

Handling is uncharacteristic for vans.  Built on a front-wheel drive car platform, the van handles more like a car than any other van out there.  Don't let this description mislead you, though.  This is a van, it is not a car, and its high center of gravity WILL cause the vehicle to roll when cornering.  Again, it's a matter of priorities.  If you want a car that handles, buy just that: a car.

Smack in the middle of the Chrysler lineup for the year 2000, the Caravan has some distinguished cousins.  Up one level in luxury is the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.  Down one level is the bare-bones Chrysler Voyager (no Plymouth any more, guys).  Let it be known that none of these is inherently any better than another--they are essentially the same car with a different look.  If you want the luxury, spring for the T &amp; C.  Priorities, priorities.

In all, I don't see any competition with better value, style, and practicality than this van.  It is a very viable alternative to a gas-guzzling SUV.  After all, I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  This is the reigning king of minivans.<br><br>
