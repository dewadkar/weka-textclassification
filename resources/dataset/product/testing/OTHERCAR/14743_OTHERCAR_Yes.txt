            I bought this vehicle (Honda CRX) because i have always love the size and body style.  I always wanted a car that was small but still very comfortable.  the CRX automatic or manual transmission is a great first car. but because it is listed as a sports car the insurance is higher.
although i love my car there are still a few things that could make it a better buy. the CRX is a two seater so that limits company. as for how it handles. it is very easy to handle smooth shifting for manual transmissions. As for automatic transmissions I was surprised at the power it had. It is a four cylinder so parents you do not have to worry about buying your child a rocket for there 16 or 18 birthday. As for air bags the two CRX's that I own. They did not have airbags I am not sure if you can get them with air bags. otherwise they are very safe and solid cars. great car for a beginner but it does have power and if you think you child or yourself has/have a heavy foot i do not recommend this car other wise you will not regret it <br><br>
