            Well, I've known since I bought my previous vehicle, a Mustang GT, that my next one would be an SUV.  I am an avid Mountain Biker, Snowboarder and aspiring surfer so it's the only logical choice.

For a long time I had my heart set on the Ford Explorer XLT.  Then I went back to the East Coast for Christmas and rode around in my friends Grand Cherokee Laredo and I knew I had to consider it.

I went to the Ford Dealership and test drove the Explorer.  I asked the sales woman what she owned and she told me she had a Jeep!  Kudos to her for her honesty.  When I asked her if she'd buy the Jeep again she said she loved it and that she would.  She said the Explorer rides like a pickup truck (rigid) as opposed to the Jeep which rides softer like a car.

Next I went immediately to the Jeep dealership and drove the Jeep.  It rode like a dream.  Plush interior and amazing ergonomics.  I stepped on the gas and it took off - 245 hp!

I also compared this with a Toyota 4runner which I never seriously considered.

I was sold.  I ordered one so I could get it the way I wanted it - V8, sunroof, CD, upgraded stereo and F package.  It took four weeks and was painless.

So far I love everything about this vehicle and hate nothing.  I plan to drive this for 20 years.

It would be good for just about anyone.  Drive it before you buy any other SUV!<br><br>
