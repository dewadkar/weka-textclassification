            I had to buy a new car in very short time. After some research ( consumer guide, carpoint.com etc ), I narrowed my selections to Mazda 626, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. I already had Honda Accord at that time and was very happy with it. But I did not want to have another one of same kind. After test driving Altima, it seemed less roomy and more noisy. So I decided  on Mazda 626, which of course scored better.

The car is equipped with Luxury package ( Alloy wheels, six speakers stereo, Sun roof, moon roof, heated mirrors ). It runs great. So far I do have any problem at all. Ride is comfortable but not the best in the class. Dashboard controls are very easy to find and use. Warranty was good ( 3 year, 36000 miles ). One very useful feature is that the fins for heat/cool air vent in the middle section moves so that driver and passenger are not constantly bombarded with hot/cold air. 

The only bad thing I found so far about this car is that the exterior color(black) is of poor quality. The color is chipping away from couple of places. Considering all the factors, I would recommend this car to anyone who wants the reliability of Honda/Toyota but do not want to the premium price.<br><br>
