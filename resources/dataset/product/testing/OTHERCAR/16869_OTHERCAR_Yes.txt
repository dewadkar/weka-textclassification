            OK, I like quick cars. Given my drothers, I would be driving a sports car. But given my responsibilities in life, I need a four door. I ended up buying a 1990 Maxima SE and its close enough to a sports car that I don't mind the extra pair of doors. I homed in on the Maxima after my ancient Honda Accord was wrecked. (I wasn't even moving at the time. Ask the police officer who watched the lady back into my car when she decided to back up and ask the cop for directions. You have to ask the cop because the Lady never saw me. But that's another story.) I suddenly needed a car and so I went back into my old copies of 'Car and Driver' and there was the Maxima SE in thier 'Top ten cars of the year' for several years running. 

I found one in mint condition, with leather upholstery and all of the bells and whistles and less than 80K miles. The car was tight and quiet and handled like a dream. The prices on these cars (at least around here) were substantially less than the prices for a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry and the Maxima had a really great six cylinder. In fact the engine in these cars is one of the nicest engines of all times. 

I found these cars to be quite reliable and the parts are quite reasonably priced compared to my old Honda. As things turned out, I was so taken with the 1990 Maxima, that when it was totalled (Again, not my fault. The guy ran a stop sign. Sez he never saw me.)  I have ended up also owning a 1991 Maxima SE and a 1995 GXE Maxima. I was amazed at how well the Maxima did in the accident. The car was hit broadside by a speeding pick up truck. From the inside the car you could not tell it had even been hit. 

There are some downsides to the Maxima. First are the motorized seat belts which drive you crazy until you get used to them. Also avoid the 1993 which had a variable valve timing engine that frankly was not as reliable as it should be. 

In Summary, my 1991 now has 110,000 miles. It is still tight and quite a pleasant car to drive. I did replace the timing belt on the 1991, but other than that there have been no major repairs on either car. I strongly recommend the 1990- 1991 Maxima.<br><br>
