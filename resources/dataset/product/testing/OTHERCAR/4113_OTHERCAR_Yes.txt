            I bought my white '98 Pathfinder LE during and end of year closeout in November of 1998. I wasn't in the market since I was very happy with the '95 Pathfinder SE I had, but I received a promotional flyer from a local dealer and the rest is history.

The '96-2000 models are worlds apart over the earlier models as far as comfort, ride and power. Don't get me wrong, the pre 2001 models won't win any races, but if you ever tried to stomp on the gas on a '95 SE with the 31.5 x 10 off-road tires, you'll age significantly until 60mph comes up.

After only 400 miles on the odometer, I went to start it one morning and it was dead. Jumped it and took it to the dealer where they tested the battery and told me that it was defective and it was promptly replaced. The heating/AC fan then developed an ever so faint chirp. The '96-2000 SE &amp; LE models came with the semi-automatic climate control and after the system achieved the desired temperature, it would set the fan to minimum and if you didn't have the radio on and were waiting a a light, you could hear this faint chirp. This was very minor and most people wouldn't bother with it, but the more I tried to ignore it the more I wanted to rip the fan out. Dealer at first couldn't recreate it (trust me it was minor), but when they did hear it, promptly replaced the fan. The only other thing that went wrong was the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light went on last summer. When I took it in they determined that it was the emissions canister and a valve. After ordering the parts the problem was resolved and hasn't re-occured since. I found out later that if you tend to be like me who has to get every last drop in the gas tank at fill-up, the gasoline could back up into the cannister and cause it to go bad. This is the case for all cars, not just the Pathfinder. Don't know whether or not it was my fault, but the dealer never made an issue of it and fixed it no questions asked. I've found the service experience to be pleasant, but they do tend to push extra work when you bring it in. In spite of what I've mentioned here, I do give the Pathfinder a positive mark for quality. I consider the situation with the battery a fluke and it could happen when you go to Sears and replace it with a new DieHard. It's really not related to the build quality of the vehicle. The chirping fan was something that most people wouldn't notice, but after paying almost $33k, I'm not going to settle. The &quot;Check Engine&quot; light was minor and who knows, I may have contributed to it. We'll have to wait and see if it can live up to my '93 Acura Vigor, which I bought new and has over 103K miles on it. I've had only one major repair ($400 for a wheel bearing at 90K miles). 

I also give it high marks for fit &amp; finish. The interior is flawless in how it's put together and the parchment grey leather seats clean up easily, which is appreciated considering our Pathfinder has spent it's entire life hauling around a four and two year old. I will agree with a couple of other posts here. The interior is a little cramped and it does occasionally suffer from some wind noise, although the latter is a minor issue. The stereo sounds great and the controls are laid out well.

My LE came with the smaller tires than the SE and while they are a little quieter, after 25K miles I think they are wearing a little quicker. I know that Nissan put larger tires on post 1999 Pathfinder LE models. 

After having owned a '90 Blazer (huge mistake!) and the '95 Pathfinder, I must say that our '98 gives the best compromise in ride, handling and comfort over any of the other SUVs I'v owned or looked at. While most competitors use a button to switch from 2WD to 4WD, Nissan still uses a floor mounted shifter. But I must say that it is so refined that you can shift it with one finger with no hesitation or gear clash. Something that I definitely couldn't say for the Blazer. The '95 was better, but the '98 is smoother.

The 4WD works great. Over the last two years I have driven it during a couple of snowstorms where the snow was 12+ inches and I purposefully took on some unplowed roads and I never had a problem. It looks great and my wife loves it. 

Gas mileage is around 17-21 mpg and maintenance doesn't cost you and are and a leg. It's exterior styling is nice and the interior rivals many luxury cars I've seen.

For what I paid for my Pathfinder, you could argue that I probably could have purchased an Explorer Limited or other comparable domestic. And while initially it would seem like I got more for my money with the Explorer, I know from a quality and reliability standpoint, I would be sorry after racking up 50K to 75K miles. I know, I've talked to Explorer, Grand Cherokee and Blazer owners. Heck, I was a Blazer owner and after two and a half years of ownership I had the following go wrong:

Electronic dash replaced three times in 1 1/2 years
4WD switch replaced
Power door lock switch replaced
Windshield wiper switch replaced
water pump replaced at 40K miles
ball joints replace at 20K miles (Never driven off road)
Torsion bar mount replaced
And although I religously change the oil every 3K miles, I noticed a puff of blue smoke at startup at 50K miles. I was later told that the early 4.3 engines had problems with the valve seals that caused oil to leak back in the cylinders and cause the smoke to appear at startup.

And I treat my cars better than most people treat their pets. Needless to say, that's when I got rid of it. 

After looking at this list, you might see why the relatively minor issues I've dealt with haven't bothered me.

Overall it's been a great truck and the interior is a little cramped as opposed to the alternative of driving a minivan, which I won't do. The other option is to cough up some more cash and by an Expedition, Tahoe or other full size SUV. But that quality thing would weigh heavily.

For 2001, Nissan addressed the power issue with the 3.5L engine and a few other cosemtic changes, but I know that the price has also gone up. If you buy one, you should be pleased. I am.<br><br>
