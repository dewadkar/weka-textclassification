            Hello chevy fans.  I am in Ohio.  If you know Ohio, you know Ohio is Chevy land.  Well, that is changing but I was always raised up to love a chevy, I married a Ford man, but guess what, he now drives a chevy LOL, and works for GM.  I love it.

Ok, on with the review.

We leased this Blazer in 1998, it was brand new.  It was fully loaded and I loved it.  Still do.  It has room, versitality, and you feel safe in it in bad weather.  Recently I was on a trip to New York City and I hit a bad snow storm in Pa.  I kicked the Blazer into 4 wheel drive and was passing everyone, safely!

I have three children and the only draw back I see is that there is never enough room for three.  Before the Blazer we had a Lumina APV, now it had room, but I never trusted it in bad weather.  The Blazer I do.  

The blazer has so much storage room in the back, ours has a luggage rack but, I never have used it.  Gas mileage is good, but I am sure it could be better.  

All and all I love my blazer, next year we get to take it in and I want a Hummer...yes, I do.  Wonder if I will get my dream?  Well..I am going to try for it at least, if not Chevy Blazer again here I come.
