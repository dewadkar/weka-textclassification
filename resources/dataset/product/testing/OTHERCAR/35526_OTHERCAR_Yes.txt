            I bought this camera about a month ago because I wanted a sturdy digital camera that was both powerful and easy to use at the same time. I was pleased to find out that the DX3900 has virtually all the strengths of my old Kodak DC240 (a camera I was very happy with!), and none of the flaws!


<b>The Pictures</b>

The improvement in picture quality is awesome. Razor-sharp images at all resolutions (0.8 - 1.6 - 2.2 Megapixels) except maybe the very highest one. (At 3.3MP picture details get a bit smudgy.) The camera seems very good at setting the exposure levels just right for every picture, regardless of the lighting conditions - an improvement from the DC240. And then there seems to be much less "colour-noise" in the shadow range of pictures taken indoors and in the evening. For me, this is perhaps the most important improvement, as I tend to favour natural lighting over flash.

Colour quality is as good as always in Kodak cameras. Not much noticeable improvement. None needed.

Long exposure times was one of the features I went out looking for. The DX3900 has manual exposure times ranging from 0.7 up to 16 seconds. I've taken beautiful pictures of cityscapes in the middle of the night, and some funky shots in dark basements. Beautiful, natural colors too - most of the time at least.

The camera has a variable (100-400) ISO speed. While I guess this feature can be useful in many cases, I've found that pictures taken at the 400 ISO setting will have a noticeably large multi-coloured grain. This means that I keep the camera set to 100 ISO at all times, expect when I really need that extra "speed". Changing the brightness levels of a too dark 100 ISO picture will probably result in better picture quality.

The only "feature" that I find really missing is the 3X optical zoom of the DC240. The 2X zoom on the DX3900 is nice but hardly sufficient (IMO). The additional 3X digital zoom is so fuzzy that I hardly ever use it. (Note: There's an optional Lens Kit available with a combination of wide-angle, extra zoom, and macro lenses. As soon as I buy these I'll be happy. :-)

<b>Tip:</b> Rather than zooming in 4X (2+2X) at 0.8 Megapixels, switch to 3.3 Megapixels, do a 2X zoom and then manually crop the center of the picture later for a much sharper 0.8 MP picture.


<b>Ease of Use</b>

Kodak cameras are the Apple Macintoshes of the digital camera world - elegantly designed and dead easy to use! Most people will just start using it right away, without ever referring to the manual. All basic settings and functionality is placed so that you find it straight away and advanced features are placed further down the menus.

Like all Kodak cameras, this one is so easy to use that even six-year-old kids (at birthday parties :) get the knack of using the camera straight away, and in minutes they're all over the place taking pictures, reviewing them, deleting the ones they don't like, having fun, etc.

All buttons and knobs are spaced so that even older people and men with big hands can operate them quite easily. Also the menus and on-screen commands are big enough so that most people in their late 40's should be able to read them comfortably from an arm's length.

Reviewing and deleting pictures, and accessing the menus is a smooth, flow-like process with very few noticeable delays. The only exception is when zooming into pictures in review mode. Then there's approx. 3 second wait before the picture appears on the screen but then scrolling around (and further zooming) is smooth and easy.

There is a huge improvement in the response time when taking pictures. From pressing the trigger-button there's only about 1/3 of a second wait for the picture to be taken. The delay on my old DC240 was at least twice that.

<b>Little things:</b> I was always very impressed with the usability of my old Kodak DC240, but the DX3900 simply blew me away - its user interface is so well designed. Kodak has obviously put a lot of effort into tweaking the menu functionality to the point of perfection (almost). All the little annoying design flaws in the DC240 (after taking more than 25.000 pictures I knew those irritating flaws by heart!), have been miraculously fixed. The new interface is obviously a labour of love.


<b>Features</b>

The DX3900 has just the right set of features and all of them useful. There's no movie recording option which may bother some people, but others might just appreciate it for the added simplicity.

One of the most interesting differences between the new DX3900 my old DC240 is that <i>they have actually removed as many features as they've added</i>. This is a very uncommon thing in high-tech gadget design nowadays as products tend to get more complex and feature ridden with every generation. 

The features that were removed were all something that no one ever really used - such as the cumbersome <i>"Locked Exposure Mode"</i> (now handled by the trigger-button) and <i>"Funky picture borders"</i>, etc.

New features: Long exposure times, ISO speed settings, extra zoom-level when reviewing pictures

The only feature that I really miss from my old camera is the 3X optical zoom. (see <i>"Pictures"</i> above)


<b>Feel</b>

Using and holding the camera also feels comfortable. It sits nicely in your hand and it has a comfortable weight. It feels sturdy without weighing too much. (Over time the silver plastic body is bound to collect scratches though.)

The lens housing is made of aluminum, and the lens motor is almost completely quiet - which is a big plus! The same goes for the auto focus and exposure. Both are quick and quiet.


<b>Memory Cards</b>

CF (Compact Flash) memory has become pretty standard these days. It's quite fast and there's a lot of competition in the market so you should be able buy 128MB (or bigger!) relatively cheap.

The 8MB card that come with the camera is a joke. It can only store about 25 pictures in the smallest resolution, or 7-8 pictures at the maximum resolution.

<b>Tip:</b> Don't buy this camera unless you also buy <i>at least</i> 32MB extra memory. A 128MB card stores about 130 - 360 pictures, depending on the picture quality.


<b>Batteries</b>

All the Kodak cameras use regular AA batteries, and this is a big <i>plus</i>, because this means you can always pick up extra juice (in gas stations, drug stores, etc.) when your batteries die while you're travelling in the middle of nowhere.

The DX3900 uses only 2 regular AA batteries. This helps keep the camera light, but also means less battery life-time than if there were 4 batteries. Still, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how long the two batteries last. (The LCD monitor is smaller than on my old DC240 and I guess this helps save energy, but the overall power-consumption of the camera seems to have gone down a lot since the old days.)

I don't have any exact numbers but, by using the range-finder instead of framing my pictures with the LCD, and keeping flash use at a minimum, I've been able to take hundreds of pictures on a single charge. Using the LCD screen to frame pictures drains the batteries very quickly, but using it to review/delete pictures, and change the settings seems to consume very little battery power.

I remember being a little skeptical about there only being two batteries, but my experience with the camera's battery-life has left me quite content. My old DC240 loaded with four batteries lasted only marginally longer than the DX3900 does with only two batteries. 

<b>Tip:</b> Buy a set of rechargeable AA batteries, and make sure you have a charger that allows you to charge down to 2 batteries at a time. Keep the extra pair of batteries in your pocket at all times. 
If you take lots and lots of pictures get 8 batteries. This has proven to more than plenty for me! 


<b>Connectivity/Software</b>

I bought my DX3900 without an EasyShare Cradle. This, and the fact that I have a Laptop with a PCMCIA (PC Card) slot, and a PCMCIA adapter for the CF (compact flash) card, means that I haven't bothered with any of the cables, or the software that came with it. No comments on this.
