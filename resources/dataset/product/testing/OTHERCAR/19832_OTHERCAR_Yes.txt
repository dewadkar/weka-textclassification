            I have a very seasoned opinion of the '96 Impala SS. I have owned two 1996 and one 1995 Impala SS. I remember the first time I saw the car on the road...it may as well been Sarah Michelle Geller nekked! It was beautiful! The car was introduced in 1994 and totally knocked my socks off. I purchased a used 1995 (in '95) and then traded it in on a brand new 1996 quite a few months later. 

The 1996 has many features that the 95 and 94 lack. Many of the changes are electronic which wouldn't make a hill of beans to the person not educated on this car. The main items changed were the instrument cluster and the shifter console. The previous cars had a digital dashboard. It was changed out for an "analogue appearing" board (still very much electronic inside) which had a bonus tachometer. The 94 and the 95 had the shifter on the steering column. On the 96, the center cup holders were removed and replaced with a floor shifter mounted on an appealing console. These changes brought back that "Hot Rod" feeling that Detroit had long since lost. It was an effort by Chevrolet to match the interior with the ferocious exterior.

Basically, the interior stinks! The light gray carpeting is easily stained. The arm rests are all plastic. Only the shifter, steering wheel and "seating surfaces" are leather. The rest is...you guessed it...imitation something or other. Chevrolet could at least been more generous with the leather. When I said "seating surfaces"...I meant only the part of the chair you are sitting on. The back, head rest and everything else is vinyl...yuck! The dash on all three of my cars squeeked around tight corners and bumps. It seemed the plastic on the doors touching the dash would rub on each other. This noise gave the car an "economy" feel.

Another item of displeasure is the trunk. The liner is a cheap, felt-like fabric that continuously falls off the side-walls. My biggest complaint in the trunk is the lack of structural protection afforded to the metal side-walls. Past the 1/16" felt material is sheetmetal...folks...this sheetmetal is the exterior of the car! If something jagged is in your trunk and you open the beast up going around a corner, guess what? Can you say "Bondo?"    ...I hope not...not on this classic! There are several aftermarket devices available to protect against this. My point is I felt it was GM's responsibility...not mine.

I love the car. After slamming it with the paragraphs above...I truly enjoy this beautiful machine. The road is half as long when you are in a vehicle like this! The power and handling is more than any car this size can compare to. Additionally, the car was meant to be Black! I know there are several Impala SS owners out there who are very proud of their Dark Green/Gray Metallic or their Dark Cherry Metallic (the only other colors available in 1996)...but they will shut up when you show to them the Black Impalas sell for more. They just do. Kids dream of owning that "triple black" hot rod. I am living that dream.
