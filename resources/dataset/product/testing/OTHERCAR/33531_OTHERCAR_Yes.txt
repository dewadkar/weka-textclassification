            We decided to get this car because Volkswagen offers an international business program that a lot of other car manufacturers don't have; they can check international credit even though credit hasn't necessarily been established in the US (as an aside).  So, we happened upon this car by accident when our old car broke down literally outside the dealership.
As far as price goes, I'd say we got some bang for our buck, at least initially.  It is a very fun car to drive, handles well, great features, but we have had some problems.  Not even a month after getting it, the O2 sensor went and we had to go back to get it replaced (much to our dismay the car cut out on the highway because of this problem).  At the 20K mile service we were pulling out of the parking lot when smoke started coming out from under the hood because of the engine fan.  Since then we've been in the dealership at least every two weeks for various problems, some caused by the dealership (which I can't really blame the manufacturer for).  We've had our headliner replaced probably 3 times, and the center console twice because they were damaged when other things were being fixed.  The passenger-side window wouldn't go down all the way and had to be fixed, but in the process the switch for the locks got busted, and we have to go back in for that. We've been in the dealership at least 5 times because of a rattling heat pan. Now the air conditioner is broken, and causes a severe vibration through the car when the brake pedal is applied for any length of time (like at a stop light).  I'm not sure if the plus-sides to driving the car really outweigh the minuses, nor am I sure if everyone has had these sort of problems with the car.  The people at Volkswagen credit leave a lot to be desired in the Customer Care department.    
Features/overall:
The interior of the car is great.  The seats are comfortable for long drives, and can be adjusted for height (good thing, two people who drive the car have considerable differences in height).  There's tons of leg and head room, and the dashboard and windshield is much further away than in most cars I've been in, including SUVs.  The buttons and gauges are flashy when lit up; they glow blue and red.  The dials cannot practically be operated without glancing at them first, especially with the radio.  The car has an automatic transmission with driver adaptation, which does present some kind of problem when the driver changes-the car will pick up suddenly when I don't want it to, and sometimes seems to have a problem going through the gears for the first five or so miles after a new driver.  It has a 2 liter engine and gets better than average gas mileage.  The back seat folds down to allow for ample trunk space, although for passengers in the back it can be bad going over bumps; as a back seat passenger I've hit my head numerous times on the ceiling and the bar that runs on either side.  The car has semi-decent horsepower and a kickdown switch under the accelerator (same as in the Audi and I suspect the Porsche), which is good when in a tight spot when rapid acceleration is needed.  I've driven other Beetles of the exact same specs and they do seem to have more horsepower.  The speedometer and odometer along with the other gauges can be difficult to read depending on the placement of the steering wheel, which has tilt and telescopic capabilities.  The cupholders are an insult; there are three placed under the center dash in such a way that medium-sized cups (from any restaurant) will not fit in them.  Safety-wise it's a very comfortable car.  There are driver and passenger side airbags along with side airbags in the seats, and height-adjustable safety belts.  It's quite low to the ground, so it's very stable going around corners and it really comes into its own past the 80 MPH mark. One thing to watch out for is going over bumps, as the underside of the car WILL scrape against anything that is over 3 or 4 inches high. The engine runs quietly at all speeds, and the steering is slightly heavy, which definitely adds to the feeling of stability on the road.  The braking is great, although I've thankfully never had to make an emergency stop. It has disk brakes all around and stops better than a lot of the cars that I've driven.  The high beams illuminate expansively, and the daytime running lights are a good feature. An alarm indicator will sound inside the car if the handbrake is left on, or if a door or the trunk is left open. The car does have ABS, and does okay in snow and ice, as long as it has proper snow tires.  The car has heated power mirrors: definitely handy in winter.  The shape of the car does present some issues when cleaning as tar and dirt can get into the cracks and crevices-which there are a lot more of on the surface of this car, making it a day-long project.
