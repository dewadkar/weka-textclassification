            After 3 years of all-weather driving and use in the city (NY) and mountains (VT), the Subaru Impreza Wagon continues to impress.

We got this car for trips around NY city and up to Vermont year 'round.  It has served us well, and is fun to drive too.  Interior cabin room is a bit tight, but this is a small car.  Real large people or big families should look for something else.

The Impreza is quick, has very responsive handling, and is sure-footed in the worst weather.  We've never passed up a parking space because of size, yet we've never had to leave anything behind because we couldn't fit it in (Winter clothes and snow gear take up a lot of room, too).  It has snazzy styling and is a quality car, though it would never be confused with a Lexus.  Just the basics here.

Why get an SUV?  This car does it all, gets 27MPG, and doesn't pollute like those dinosaurs!  I couldn't find a parking space for a Jeep Cherokee in my neighborhood anyway...
