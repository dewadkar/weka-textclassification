            I recently purchased the Kodak DC-215 in the &quot;Metallix&quot; version which included a metallic blue exterior w/ 8Mb flash card, a second 8Mb flash card and a SanDisk flash card reader.  Bought it from PC Wonders and was very happy.  Total package cost including shipping $312.00.

First off, I am very happy with this camera. Sure, I would like to have 3 megapixels, but at the price and size, this camera is tough to beat.  The build quality is VERY good ... this is a solid camera.  Further, it is well thought out and seems to be very reasonable on batteries.  By contrast, I used a Nikon Coolpix 900 for awhile, and while the pictures were better, the battery use and ease of use were poor.  The picture quality of the DC-215 is more than enough for email, web sites and printing out high quality pictures suitable for framing up to 5X7.  You can go larger, but you start to see grain.  

The only negative I have encountered is taking pictures indoors without a flash.  I have not experimented with manual exposure, but in the auto setting it is impossible to take a picture without a flash and not have it come out blurred.  The camera needs to be on a tri-pod for photos without a flash.  Perhaps if I adjusted the exposure, this can be illeviated.

If you buy any digital camera, you need to spring for the SanDisk reader.  You really don't get the full benefits of a digital camera without it.  I love the thing.  In sum, I have used Nikon and Olympus digital cameras, but the DC-215 at the price is a very strong value for a camera for every day use and bringing along on family trips and fitting it into your pocket.  Even my wife uses it all the time to capture pictures of the kids, a testament to ease of use.  Very happy with my purchase and highly recommended.<br><br>
