            Can Volkswagen do anything wrong these days?  Lately, it seems as if they are making one great car after another, and the 2000 GTI is no exception. VW has come a long way since the days of the Quantum and Dasher. The GTI can be summed up in two words, fun and functional.

Styling on the GTI is boxy, but balanced.  Many call it downright ugly, but styling is subjective.  Look closely and you might see a hint of BMW 2002 in the high roof and large glass area.  From behind the new GTI is all European, and very reminiscent of the first GTI's.

Inside you'll get a surprising level of luxury and comfort, given the $18,000 price.  Leather seats, CD player, 4-wheel discs, and a sunroof bigger than the Grand Canyon, all conspire to  make the GTI one of the best cars on the market at any price. The high, boxy roof-line give the driver a commanding view of the road in all directions - excellent visibility inspires confidence during "spirited" driving.  Dashboard controls are arranged in a neat, orderly fashion - more functional than fancy.  Manual seats adjust into several positions, and are firm, supportive and sporty.  Front seats also move up and forward to allow easy access for back seat passengers, no more spleen damage from contorting and squeezing past the front seats.  More cars should be using this ingenious mechanism.  Typical, for VW, blue with red lights on the instrument panel look great.  Large tachometer and speedometer are easy to read.  A turbo boost gauge would be a nice addition to the instrument cluster, but that would be more for pleasure than purpose.  Monsoon stereo sounds sharp and clear with plenty of bass, this stereo is one of the best at any price (Monsoon adds $300). The rear storage area is large considering the GTI's compact dimensions, a split fold down rear seat adds to the utility of this car.

On the road the GTI is a dream to drive.  Not many cars are as versatile as this little VW, it's fun around town, on twisty back roads, and equally comfortable on the open highway - what doesn't this car do well?  The turbo-charged 1.8L engine revs happily to the red line with no drama, noise or vibration.  VW claims 150 hp from this silky engine, but it feels like more.  The power comes on, and just keeps coming - at all speeds and in all gears.  The GTI delivers almost as much horsepower as the Honda Civic Si, but in more civilized manner. Around town the turbo is not tiring or balky, unlike other turbo-charged cars. The brakes are great, but feel a little over sensitive at first. The 5-speed transmission is near perfect in it's gearing, and the shifter is smooth but precise. It's just plain fun.

Two Complaints: 1) I didn't buy one. 2) The 5 spoke wheels can be hard to clean. 

You really have to search for flaws on this car !

Overall, the 2000 GTI is a perfect balance of fun and functionality.  It's fun to drive hard, and easy to use everyday.  This maybe the perfect car, and all for well under $20,000, plus a 10 year 100,000 mile power-train warranty... I wonder, how close is the nearest VW dealership?
