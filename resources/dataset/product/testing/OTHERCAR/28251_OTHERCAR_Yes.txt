                 I myself have owned a Jeep Grand Cheerokee and a Chevy Blazer, but now the vehicles I own is a Dodge Durango.  The Durango exhibits its raw power compared to these other vehicles.  Many times with the other SUV's I find myself always lacking power or off-road capabilities, but with my Durango it's no problem.  Off-road or city driving, it doesnt matter.  I resently drove on a 5 hour journey for a basketball game and where my other rides were not as smooth on longer journey's and I had to get out and stretch or I would be very stiff, it's not that way with my Dodge.  I could sleep in there if I wanted to.  Also the 3rd seat helps me when I want to take some extra buddies along for the ride or just for storage space.  All the seats fold down nicely for alot of hauling room.  The only complaint I have is with the gas mileage.  I know everything can't be perfect, but, I can only get sometimes 12 to 10 miles per gallon. Which with today's gas prices is not good. Also the warranty on this thing is great. But overall I cant say enough good things about my Dodge.<br><br>
