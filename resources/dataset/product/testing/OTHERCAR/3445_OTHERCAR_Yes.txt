            For the last ten years or so, I've driven a Nissan Sentra SE-R. It's a zippy little two-door sedan with a 2.0 liter DOHC engine pumping out 140HP. It handles well for a car that cost $15K, but there was certainly a lot of room for improvement. When I went shopping for a new car last year, I wanted something a was bit more upscale, handled better, and had a bit more power than the Sentra. I looked at the Lexus IS300, the BMW 330, Nissan Maxima SE, Acura S4, and several other cars before purchasing a red Acura 3.2CL "Type S".

The thing that really sold me on the car was the 260HP V6 engine. The Acura plays the horsepower trump card on just about everything else in this class! And not by 5 or 10hp; it most cases the Type S has 30-40hp on the competition! The engine is silky smooth and, because it's a V6, produces lots of torque even at low RPMs. Floor it at a stoplight and the car will quite happily spin it's wheels until the traction control system kicks in. Hold the pedal to the floor and you'll frequently get a brief wheelspin when the transmission shifts from 1st to 2nd gear.

Styling-wise, I think that you have to admit the Acura 3.2CL Type is is a bit bland. In fact, the entire Acura product line is bland! I opted to purchase the rear spoiler ($700 list), which I think improves the look of the car dramatically.

The interior of the 3.2CL is surprisingly spacious and well-appointed. Those who have tried the Audi S4 or BMW 328/330 will be surprised at how much interior room is to be found in the Acura. The back seat lacks a bit of leg room, but that seems to be a common feature in all coupes these days. Leather is standard on all 3.2CL's and the Type S model has perforated leather on the seats, gear-shift, and steering wheel for an added "cool" factor. With the sun-roof and windows closed, the car is almost completely quiet inside. Under hard acceleration, you hear a satisfying warble from the exhaust, but wind and road noise is never a problem. The trunk is surprisingly spacious for a coupe!

Electronics-wise, the Acura is very well outfitted! The six-disc in-dash CD-changer seems to be the envy of everyone who's ridden in the car! It is infinitely more convenient than a trunk-mounted unit and the steering-wheel mounted controls make controlling the unit a piece of cake. Acura's DVD-based GPS navigation system is an expensive option ($2000) but well worth the price of admission in my mind. While not completely flawless the system does a surprisingly good job of getting you where you need to go! It doesn't know anything about prevailing traffic conditions, so it will often pick routes which are shortest distance-wise but longer time-wise. Still, I've become so enamoured of the system I can't imagine how I used to get along without it...

Unfortuately, every silver lining has an associated cloud. In this case, the "cloud" associated with the 3.2CL Type S is the transmission. A car like this begs for a 6-speed manual, but the only transmission offered by Acura is a 5-speed automatic. 

In fully automatic mode, the Acura's transmission is as good as any other automatic transmission I've driven. It tends to upshift into 5th gear to improve fuel economy, but will readily downshift into 3rd when rapid acceleration is necessary. Floor the gas pedal at a stop and the transmission will rev to redline in each gear to achieve fast acceleration. Shifts are fairly smooth, but not exactly quick. In particular, when cruising in 5th gear, it feels like the car takes a bit of time to downshift to 3rd gear and get the engine spinning. 

You would think that the saving grace for the transmission might be Acura's "Sequential Sport Shift" mode of operation. Think again. Sequential Sport Shift is NOT going to give you perfect 150ms downshifts like a Ferrari 360 Modena with their F1-style paddle shifter. In fact, the Acura system doesn't come close. The transmission controls the shift from 1st to 2nd gear and automatically downshifts back to 1st when the car comes to a stop. The driver can control shifts from 2nd through 5th gears. The transmission prevents you from doing a downshift if it would cause the engine to over-rev. Upshifts work fairly well, but downshifts aren't nearly as smooth... The shift from 3rd down to 2nd seems to be particularly problematic. The shift from 3rd to 2nd frequently causes passengers to "lurch forward" as decelerates rapidly. This tendency can be mitigated somewhat by shifting when the transmission is at lower RPMs in 3rd gear or by being on the gas during the downshift.

The bottom-line with the transmission is that if you've been driving a car with an automatic transmission, you'll probably think the Acura does a better job than your current vehicle. If you're used to a manual transmisson, you'll probably be less than thrilled with the Acura, Sequential SportShift or not.

Handling-wise, the car performs very well though it's probably a notch below a most sport-oriented sedans. Body roll is very well controlled, particularly in comparison to my old Sentra. Suspension is taut, but not tight enough as to become a burden over rough pavement. The seats are comfortable and hold you in position very well. Handling is fairly crisp, but you can feel that the car is larger than the Audi A4/S4 or Lexus IS300. 

One thing to note when trying to push the car to the limits of handling is the Vehicle Stability Assist system. This is one of those systems that combines traction control, anti-lock brakes, and wheel speed sensors to try and improve the handling of the car. If the system notices that the car is about to slide, it will reduce power and selectively apply the brakes. This all sounds great, but in practice the VSA system can be a bit intrusive. Don't get me wrong, it DOES work. VSA saved my butt when I hit a patch of oil on a rain-soaked off-ramp BUT it felt to some degree like I was fighting it for control of the car. A less-experienced driver probably wouldn't have noticed the system as much (or at all).

I've lived with the car for about 15 months now and put over 13,000 miles on it. As you'd expect with an Acura, I haven't had a single problem. The car still feels solid and tight. I'm still extremely happy with the car, especially give everything you get for the price. If you're looking for the ultimate sports coupe, however, the lack of a manual transmission keeps the Acura 3.2CL Type S from being a true killer car...
