            In 1995, I used the Geo Prism for several days as a rental car when my car was in the shop being repaired.  Other than the name on the car, I would swear that the car was a Toyota.  Of course, that was the intent though with the Geo line was to emmulate the Toyota line only with a cheaper price.

Considering all things though they did rather well.  The 1995 Geo Prism handled very well and other than the fact that I kept on looking for the clutch in my old car, I did rather well driving the Prism.  (My car has a clutch!) The engine has great pickup with its 4 Cylinder, 1.6 Liter, 105 Horsepower Engine.  The Prism also gets great gas mileage just like the Toyota Corolla for an average in my case for about 29 miles a gallon.

One thing that was strange for me was the brakes!  They gripped the road remarkably well.  I have to admit that when I put on the brakes I wasn't expecting how well they worked and I gave myself a bit of a whiplash.

The Prism which I was driving did not have any fancy options nor pizzazz, but I didn't mind because I'm not that type of person.  The windows were the old fashioned kind that you roll up manually and the radio was only an AM/FM radio.  The interior was really comfortable and the seat really helped support my back well.

There were a few things that I didn't like about the Geo Prism.  One of them was the fact that the back seat of the vehicle was kind of cramped.  My youngest son has a time riding in the back as well as a group of ladies from my work who decided to &quot;try out&quot; the car when I drove it to work.  The back seat really was not comfortable as I sat in it myself after that incident.

Another thing that I didn't like about this car was that it was so light.  When I was driving home from work one day it was windy and I had a hard time keeping the car in my lane on the Interstate!

Other than that, the 1995 Geo Prism is a remarkable vehicle which is very well made and rather low priced.  Most of the people that I showed the car to were very impressed with it.  One of them was my best friend and while she didn't purchase the Prism, she did buy the 1995 Geo Metro.

If you're looking for a lower priced rather reliable car, I would encourage you to look at the Geo brand cars.<br><br>
