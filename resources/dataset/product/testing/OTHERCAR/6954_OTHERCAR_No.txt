            In August my husband and I decided it was time to purchase a new vehicle. I was driving a Grand am at the time and was ready for a larger vehicle. We really liked the Chevy Blazers. They were so nice and roomy I fell in love immediately.

 Soon after we brought it home I realized that it did not get good gas mileage. In the first two weeks of driving it I had filled in up atleast 4 times. My Grand am could go 2 weeks on 1 tank of gas.

 Since then we have had it in the shop 4 times. At first the door locks quit working, then the back hatch would not lock, then the front locks stopped working again. It is going back in the shop this next week because the door locks, the interior light, the bright lights, and many other things have stopped working.

 I bought this vehicle because I thought it would be reliable but instead I am paying for a vehicle that the service men are driving more than I am. I am not happy at all and I hope they figure out how to fix this thing soon.<br><br>
