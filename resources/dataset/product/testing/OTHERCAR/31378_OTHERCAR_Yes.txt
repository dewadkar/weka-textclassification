            We've had our Alero for more than a year and 1/2, and have racked up more than 20,000 miles.  I've got to say, I'm still impressed with the car today.

I was initially drawn to the Alero because of its styling - it looked grown up and sophisticated but still fit into our low price range.  It looks substantial on the road, and when it was new on the market I often got looks from passing motorists wondering what it was.

Styling is subjective though, so its up to you to make the call.  Exterior fit and finish is good, although the bumpers are very plastic and not very solid feeling.  However, I was recently in a small front end colision, and the bumpers held up fine.  The only other detail with the bumpers is that there is a cheap looking gap between the headlights and the bumper that holds them.

Performance wise, the 4 cylinder engine gets the job done.  It can be loud if you push it, but it really feels like it has the power of a 6 cylinder.  Off the line you can hold you own with most other cars.  Cruising at 70 or 80 is pretty effortless, and the car is smooth and easy to drive going that fast.  However, don't try to get aggressive on the backroads.  Mainly due to the poor stock tires I believe, the car reaches its handling limit very quickly - you'll hear a lot of tire noise as they give up on a quick corner but I probably drive a little quicker than most.

On the inside, ergonomics are good.  Compared to its sister car the Grand Am, I think this car is leaps and bounds above the playschool look of the Pontiac.  The plastic looks somewhat cheap, but its put together well and feels solid.  The center console tends to get dirty with its deep grooves, but everything works well.

We got the optional CD player, which for the most part has worked well.  The stock speakers sound decent, however one of them blew when we pushed the volume a little too high.  It was replaced under warranty for no charge.  Interior volume is great for its price...it easily fit 4 adults on a 1,000 mile weekend trip without a problem, and its large trunk swallowed all of our stuff.  On a random note, when a service light comes on alerting you to a scheduled maintenance period, it stays on, rather than turning off after a few minutes like in most cars.  This can get somewhat annoying, as the small orange light stays illuminated on the side of your dashboard.

Small interior fit and finish issues include the door trip - if you scrape your foot while getting in the car, you can sometimes unclasp the plastic trim piece.  Also, the casing for the door locks is cheap - if you push the button to hard you are likely to pop it out of its casing requiring you to take off the armrest of the door to pop it back in.

ALl in all though, I can't think of a car in its price range that I feel would offer a better mix of overall style, featuers, size, and performance.
