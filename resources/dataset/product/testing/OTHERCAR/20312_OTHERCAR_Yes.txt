            I was driving a Ford Mustang GT convertible and decided with my son and his friends getting older and bigger, I needed a larger vehicle to accommodate them.  Climbing in and out of the car for them to get in the backseat was really getting old.  I chose, that over them hopping into the car with the top down as they all suggested, that I should just buy something a little larger.

When looking for an SUV, we test drove the Ford Explorer, Isuzu Rodeo and the Dodge Durango.  We chose the Mercury Mountaineer for it's comfort and interior roominess, ease of handling, easy to fold down split back seat, the larger V-8, price, and a feeling of safety.

I have yet to be disappointed with the vehicle.  It's had two recalls, one for a hood latch replacement and the other for a problem with the cruise control.  The dealership handled the recalls in a very professional manner, and had the vehicle back to us in a short period of time.

Yes, the V-8 likes to visit the gas station a little more often than I would care to, but it's well worth the extra we spend for the &quot;get up and go&quot; the bigger engine allows.  I never feel left behind by other traffic, and am not afraid to pass on little two lane roads if the need arises.

Recently a friend asked to drive my Mountaineer since she is wanting something bigger herself.  She was very pleased with the way it handled, and with the fact that it didn't ride like a pick-up.  She found that for those of us who are vertically challenged, it is easy to gauge distance over the hood.

I am extremely happy with my Mountaineer, and when the lease comes to an end, plan on purchasing the vehicle, or leasing a new one.<br><br>
