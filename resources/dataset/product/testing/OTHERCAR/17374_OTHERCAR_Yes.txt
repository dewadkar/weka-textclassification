            One statement says it all: Thank God we got a 99 eclipse. The 2nd generation eclipse (1995-1999), was a sure footed, fun to drive, pocket rocket. Sporty exterior, stylish cockpit-like interior, and enough engine to make things fun. With the option of upgrading to either the turbocharged GST or even better, the turbocharged all-wheel drive, GSX, the eclipse had something for everyone. With a minumum of investment, the gst and gsx were easily launched into sub-ferrari type acceleration. The RS and GS too were easily introduced into the same type of acceleration with an aftermarket turbo kit or even by staying naturally aspirated with some engine worke and bolt-ons. The light weight and excellent suspension make for a great handling car.

Then along came y2k. One of the first millenium bugs obviously found its way into the Mitsubishi mainframe, and outpoped the 3rd generation eclipse. The styling may eventually grow on you, but it lacks that attention grabbing stance of its 2nd gen. brother. Also missed is the previously available turbocharged i-4, quite possibly one of the best engines in the entire import scene. Also gone is the sure footed, put-you-back-in-your-seat-and-leave-you-there,I-dare-you-to-drop-the clutch-at-any-rpm-and-I-will-grab-the-tarmac-no-matter-what, all-wheel drive system. The awd completely dominated the import drag racing scene, until it was forced to be limited to its own bracket only to race other awd eclipse and talons.

The y2k eclipse is just plain lacking the excitement brought by the previous two generations of eclipses. Gone is the old &quot;power bulge&quot; hood, in its place, we get grand-am inspired ribs on the doors. The new eclipse just doesnt jump out at you anymore, it appears to be a much more laid back, dare i say, sedan-ish. The new powertrain extends that belief. The new top of the line GT is more than half a second slower in the 1/4 mile and 0-60 than the previous eclipse top of the line GS-T and GSX. Although still quick, the point remains the new car is slower than the old car. The new v6 is much more tamer than the old turbo i-4. Redline has dropped a few thousand rpms, much to the dismay of the high-revving import fanatics, and power is also down, if only by 5 horsepower.

The new eclipse will sell. However, the DSM(Diamond Star Motors-makers of the previous two generations of eclipses, talons, galant vr-4s, avengers, and sebring coupes) faithful are very disappointed. In fast, as of this time, the hugely popular and successful Club DSM has decided to not include this new eclipse into the international car club. New buyers will be ones looking for a sport-coupe w/ a sedanish manner, as the pocket rocket has officially been passed on...at least until Mitsu releases it supercharged v6 eclipse, expected out 2001-2002.....<br><br>
