            Well I finally took the plunge and bought a new vehicle.  After months of research (and reading opinions) on different cars & SUV's I finally settled on the Chevy Tracker.  So far I really like it.

I got a 4 cylinder, 2.0 liter engine, which I have noticed is a little slow.  There is a button near the shift that I can use for a little more power but I have yet to try it.  I really don't need a lot of power driving through the city.  This is an automatic, 2 wheel rear drive with the shifter in the middle of the 2 front seats.  I have power windows, locks, mirrors, remote keyless entry, cd player and a luggage rack.  It is a 4 door (the first vehicle I have owned with 4 doors!)  

The front seats are roomy with plenty of leg room on the passenger side.  The back seats I'll admit are lacking in the leg room area.  Also there are no cup holders in the back, which I didn't care for because my daughter rides in the back.  Then the cargo area is fairly roomy with a luggage cover and net.  The 2 rear seats fold down to make more room for carrying bigger items.  You have to go through a little work to get the seats down, but once they are down there is plenty of room.  One thing I really miss is a center arm rest in the front.  I never realized how much I used that until I no longer have one.  There are small storage compartments on all four doors to use for maps, cds, and items of that size.  In between the front seats there are 2 cup holders, which hold the bigger 20 oz bottles and 32 oz cups without tipping over, 2 small storage trays and a outlet for a cell phone.  The dash is laid out nicely with easy to read controls for the heater and such.  The CD player has good quality sound.  There are also 2 map lights on the rear view mirror which I really liked.

I was surprised at how well the Tracker handles.  I had never driven an SUV before and I wasn't sure what to expect.  It basically drove like a car.  The ride is quiet and it isn't as rough a ride as I had expected, very smooth.  I don't feel like I am going to tip over around corners.  Like I did say it could use a little more power, but I look at it like I'm getting better gas mileage, which by the way I am getting 22 mpg in the city.  

I looked at plenty of cars and a few SUV's and for the price I believe it's a great value.  I really didn't need anything much bigger and the sunfire I had before it was a little small.  This is perfect for my daughter and myself for mini vacations and such.  At the time Chevy was offering a $2000 cash back which helped bring the price down.  So far I like everything about it, except the few minor things I mentioned.  I hope this helps anyone looking, this is my first car review and I wrote about everything I could think of.
