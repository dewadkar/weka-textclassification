            Our 1996 Tracker was leased for economics...the lease was cheap and so was the gas mileage.

Mechanically, this truck ran fairly well for the three years we had it.  The speedometer was repaired several times, but still had that clicking sound when we returned it.  It was a four speed whose clutch was not touchy and slid into gear well.  

The short wheelbase made the ride of this truck feel like you were on Mr. Toads Wild Ride.  I have been thrown around less on some of the best amusement park rides. 

This car is for people who do not bruise easily.  It does serve it's self well with transporting large articles.
