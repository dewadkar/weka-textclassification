            First of all, I have been an Audi fan for basically all of the 90's.  I also am i member of the Sport Car Club of America and I know my cars.  This car is one of the best Audi has ever made.  Speaking of power this car stock is about 150 horse.  However, unlike other sports cars of this class( mainly BMW) this car has a turbo which is easy to harness more power from.  For a few bucks you can chip the turbo and get a lot more horse out of the engine.  You can go anywhere from 200 to nearly 300 HORSE using a chip depending on the power you want.  Also this car is much lighter than Audi's S4 ( the sport version of this car) and really brings its racing aspects into the general public.
Bottom Line -- buy  a radar detector because you will be going 90 miles  an hour without noticing it.<br><br>
