            My husband and I were somewhat reluctant to buy a used car for the first time...but several things convinced me to take the risk.  Obviously, it's a great looking car, it's roomy,  it rides like a full-sized luxury model, it has an awesome stereo system, and handles like a dream.  We've had our's a year now and have had zero problems with it during that time...and for me, reliability is a huge factor in what car I drive.  Being a homemaker/mom, it is a great car for the short trips to the store...lots of room in the trunk for everything I buy.  The back seat can seat three kids and the front has airbags on both sides so I feel great about the safety of this car.  It seems to get okay gas mileage although I haven't actually tested it.  I think anyone would enjoy driving it although I'd be reluctant to get it for a teenager because of the engine power (I know that's what they like but not what they need until they get some experience).  <br><br>
