            This is my contribution to the write off for roadiem. I do not make myself out to be a auto reviewer. I will more than likely fudge this up, but it is for the best cause. 

I never knew roadiem other than loving his music articles. He loved the same blues music artists I did. I am a very sensitive, caring person. I could not help but feel pain over the news of roadiem's passing. 

roadiem wrote with a passion, and zest that I can only hope to accomplish a 1/4 of. My prayers go out to his family, and his friends. A list of contributing writers is listed at the bottom of this article. 

I purchased my used Chevy Nova when I was in High School. It has seen me through so many jams and memories that I can't even recall them all. In High School it didn't matter if you drove a hooptie or a Cadillac. As long as you had wheels, you had friends. Lots of them, but none of them had any damn gas money.

My 4 door little baby wasn't anything special, really. A 4 cylinder, that you couldn't ever smoke someone with. It sure did cut down on the speeding tickets. The baby blue color outside seemed to work well with the dark blue interior fabric color.

Gas mileage on this baby is great. Even with high prices it is still a affordable alternative to drive. 5 bucks in the tank will still last a while. I can get 29-35 miles a gallon out of her. I tend to stick to my Ford Ranger now, but will always have a soft spot for my baby blue.

The automatic transmission never gave me any trouble. 8 years after I bought the car it's still going! If I knew more about it I would tell you. 

The air conditioner was awesome. Crisp cold air blasted me, when it finally ran out of freon I suffered some heat. I was reluctant to pay to have it converted. I have since converted it to the new clean coolant, though.

The Nova was pretty roomy considering it was a compact car. Passengers in the back seat are still comfortable even when the front seats are pushed back a bit.

Trunk space was another great feature. I could go grocery shopping and still sneak 4 of my friends in the old 45 drive in theater.

Power doors, locks and windows what is that? This car was a manual powered baby. The doors opened with a handle that broke off after being exposed to too much sun. It was nothing that a little super glue and a lot of patience couldn't fix. The locks were triggered by me pressing down on them, or lifting up. Rolling down the windows required hand turning. This was ok so long as it didn't rain and you had the back windows down.

My one true complaint with this car is drunk bumps. You know those grooves that mark lanes? The white reflective ones? Well when you change lanes you can feel it. Not the best thing for long road trips, but I can look past it. The whole car makes a THUD THUMP noise as you are vibrated. This is avoided by cranking the stereo up.

Which brings me to the stereo. Factory installed Delco lasted all of 3 months in baby blue. It had a tape player and am/fm radio. But, in High School it had to be loud so I could be proud! I still to this day have the factory stereo in the trunk.

Who knew that some 8 years later it still runs? The only real repairs were made to the body itself after having a date with a motorcycle. Since this car is basically a Toyota Corolla, parts are a bit iffy to come by. I have found that most places don't even stock the parts I need. Chevy is no help either. However Toyota has been a tremendous help. So if you have this car and need parts, try that route.

Please take the time to read the other writers submissions. This is my very first write off, and I am proud to be a part of it. All proceeds from these articles will go to roadiem's wife and family.
