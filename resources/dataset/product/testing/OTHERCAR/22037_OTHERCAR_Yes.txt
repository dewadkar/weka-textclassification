            The Kodak DC215 comes in a silver color with a 4MB CompactFlash card with a list price of $349, I found it for as low as $249.

Then you have the Kodak DC215 that comes in a Millennium Edition that has a gold body with a 8MB CompactFlash card instead of 4. Plus it comes with a USB CompactFlash card reader (SanDisk ImageMate) this speeds image downloads to your computer. The Millennium Edition retails for $449 and I found one for $352. 

Then there is a Metallic edition that comes in five different colors with all the same features and prices as the Millennium Edition. 

This is an entry level or beginners camera that is basically a point and shoot camera with a 2x zoom. The 2x zoom is equivalent to 29mm-58mm, this gives you a good wide-angle selection. 

The DC215 is a 1.0 megapixel with resolution of 1152 x 864 pixel images and 640 x 480 pixel images. There are three levels in each resolution to save the photos in Good, Better or using Best JPEG compression. You can print picture perfect prints as large as 5 x 7 inches. 

<b>The 8MB CompactFlash card </b>
Here is about how many photos you get using the 8MB card.

High Resolution (HR) Standard Resolution (SR)
Best---Quality &#150 22 HR &#150 54 SR
Better-Quality &#150 32 HR &#150 70 SR
Good -Quality &#150 54 HR- 110 SR

For the 4 MB card you can figure about one half of the above.

<b>Other Specifications </b>
The Color is 24-bit or 24 million different colors.
The Lens is 2x true optical glass zoom and Focus-free.
Built-in flash with auto, fill and red-eye settings.
It takes 4 AA batteries (included) or you can purchase an optional AC adapter.
The File Formats that you can save the photos in are JPEG (EXIF), FPX.
Built-in self timer at 10 seconds.
A video output for viewing images on your TV. (NTSC or PAL formats)

<b>Requirements </b>
This camera can be used for the PC and the Macintosh computers.

<i>The PC</i>
Windows 95, 98 or NT 4.0 (Will work on Windows ME)
A Pentium 90 MHz processor or greater (it works with AMD K6-2 and up.)

<i>The Macintosh </i>
A Macintosh system OS 7.6.1 or better

<i>Both</i>
16 MB of RAM, 32 MB recommended. (NT 4.0 needs 32 MB)
Your hard drive needs 90 MB free for the software.
A CD or DVD-ROM for the software installation.
A 256 color monitor or better.
A Serial port
For the Millennium 2000 Edition it requires a USB port for the PC card reader.

<b>The View</b>
This camera has an optical viewfinder, which save on your batteries if you are not using the LCD Display. I personally like the optical viewfinder when taking photos.

In the back of the camera it has a TFT color 1.8-inch LCD screen. You can focus in on what you want to take a photo of using the LCD screen. It also has menus and a lot of information on your settings in the LCD screen, plus you can view the photo you have taken or any on the CompactFlash card.

On the top of the camera is a LCD monochrome data readout showing the camera status and settings. Some of the things it shows are if the flash is on, battery strength, how many photos left and more.

<b>Software</b>
Software that comes in the Millennium Edition.
For Windows, ArcSoft PhotoPrinter Software Version 2.0, Mounter an application & driver and a TWAIN Acquire Module.

For the Macintosh, a Plug-in compatible with the Photoshop Software.

For Both, PhotoDeluxe Software and PageMill software from Adobe Systems.

<b>Overall</b>
It takes good pictures, all you have to do is point and shoot, it is a very simple and easy camera to use. It feels comfortable in your hands and all the buttons are easy to reach and use.

Remember this is for the people who are starting out in a Digital camera and for the ones looking for an easy point and shoot camera.

It prints 4 x 6 prints beautifully, I took the same print and enlarged it to an 8 x 10 and there you could see is was starting to get grainy. When you step back a couple of the feet from the 8 x 10, it really looks good, so framing one wouldn&#146t be too bad.

You can use NiMH, (nickel metal hydride) NiCd, lithium or alkaline batteries. I highly recommend a rechargeable battery, this camera will go through a set pretty fast if you are using the color LCD Display.

It comes with a Warranty of one year.

If your looking for a digital camera that won&#146t break an arm and a leg, then I highly recommend the Kodak DC215 Millennium Edition.
