            We bought the <b>Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640</b> for Christmas last year. It took us until August to get the camera hooked up to our computer. I called Tech Support on several occasions and they were not much help.

We ended up having to buy the San Disk Flash Path Floppy Disk Adapter. This had us up and running with the camera in a matter of five minutes. I was relieved at last that I could finally use my camera with ease.

The <b>Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640</b> takes great pictures. The pixel quality is not the greatest, but for an inexpensive camera it is good. The <b>Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640</b> is simple to use. We were pointing and shooting in 15 minutes. 

We have hooked the <b>Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640</b> up to our TV to view the pictures and they come out crisp and clean. The camera comes with three settings of picture quality. Each one has lower pixels but the ability to take more pictures. The minimum amount of pictures is 24 the maximum is 96. I have found that setting it on the middle setting works for us.

Smart Media is now selling memory cards so you can increase the amount of pictures you can take with the <b>Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640</b>. This is great if you want to take the camera on vacation with you. If you will not have access to a computer to download the pictures an extra memory card will help you out.

If you have a computer and plan to download pictures good luck this is no easy task. I would recommend purchasing the floppy disk adapter it would make life a lot easier. The battery life is extremely short if you view the pictures the back of the camera. I would not recommend product to the beginner.
