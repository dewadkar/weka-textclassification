            The <b>DC240 Zoom</b> Digital Camera has made the life of this webmaster easy.  I am able to quickly shoot pictures, and thanks to the USB connection, I can then upload them to the site within minutes.  The &quot;Picture Easy&quot; software is quick and serviceable.  I can do some fast enhancements and cropping, and then the image is ready to be uploaded.

<b>The Camera</b> looks like a modern instamatic camera.  There is an LCD screen on the back for view/review of photos, and there is a switch where you might expect to find the film door, but other than that, it looks and works much the same as a simple Kodak instamatic style camera.  Doors on the side of the camera conceal the connection ports for USB and video, as well as the 8MB memory card.  1.3 Megapixel Picture Quality is more than ample for images on the web, but I am surprised at how nice the prints are.  The zoom lens is nice, but it will eat your battery time if you get to playing with it a lot, as will the LCD display window on the back.  I generally don't use the LCD display except when I am setting the camera up for use.

The camera comes with a set of disposable batteries so that you can get going right away while the rechargeables are getting their first time in the charger.  I find that battery time is very much a function of how much you use those extras like the zoom and the LCD display.  If you will be leaving your camera on, or using those features a lot, then you will probably want to have spare batteries on hand so that you don't miss the shot.  I do bring extra batteries with me, but I find that judicious use of the on/off switch saves my batteries.

The USB cable that is included is the connection of choice for me.  It was a big reason to get this make of camera, as I don't like to fiddle around with connections.  USB is so fast and simple.  I never use the video cable that is also included, but some folks may want to use it to view their pictures on their TV screens, and they will appreciate that option.

The <b>Picture Easy Software</b> that drives the whole thing is likewise very easy to use.  It loads quickly from the CD ROM, and is very intuitive to use.  I sometimes get a little frustrated with the time it takes to retrieve the pictures from the camera though.  The memory card can hold a great many images depending on how you set up the camera, and it can take a few minutes if you have a number of files to transfer.  Still this is faster than processing film and scanning the prints.  If you plan to do some serious manipulation of the images, then you will need to use other software such as Photoshop.  If however, you are looking to get something cleaned up and on the web in a hurry for instance, then this software is all that you need.

As I began to look into buying a Digital Camera, I found out that Kodak had seen the digital future of photography some time ago, and began spending the money on research and development in order to make the transition a smooth one.  It was money well spent I think.  I find that the USB connection, and the ability to shoot two pictures in rapid succession is invaluable to me.  I also appreciate the ease and speed with which I can get the images out of the camera and onto the internet.  The versatility of the Kodak DC240 made it a great buy at under $500.00 for me.<br><br>
