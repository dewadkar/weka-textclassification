            Considering the current price range of quality mega-pixel cameras nowadays, I didn't have very high expectations to begin with of my $65 camera (that came with free shipping though!).  My only purpose for this camera was to take pictures of items I wanted to sell on my website or ebay.

Three hours and two sets of batteries later, I finally was able to take some suitable pictures with the camera.  I ended up having to do this outside, where the flash was not required because the flash seemed to make the already blurry pictures even less clear.  Also, the smaller you resize your picture, the clearer it seems to appear, so be sure to keep that in mind.

This product definitely has some cool features, such as a self-timer to take pictures and the different flash options.  But you may not care too much about these features once you actually upload these pictures to the screen and notice the poor resolution.

I think this camera is a good starter for those who want to see if they would like to fork out the money for a good digital camera.  If you really just want the camera to take pictures of items to sell, this camera may just be all you need.  However, I might also suggest purchasing a cheap scanner instead for better quality than this camera.  Also, please make sure you head to your local Sam's Club and buy some AA batteries in bulk if you plan to use this camera.  You'll need them all.
