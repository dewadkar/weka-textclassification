                 I bought my Cavalier used in February.  I love it. I needed a dependable vehicle, mainly for work transportation.  I had been divorced about 4 years. I had not had a dependable vehicle, my x-husband was cheap and did not think I needed anything. Then I married my 2nd husband.  What a sweetheart.  He drove me everywhere, he loves the time together.  I became independant during the years I was single.  Our missionaries in our church drive new cars every 3rd year.  It was time to sell the ones they had and purchase new ones.  I paid $7000.  I had my mechanic give it a thorough check.  It passed with flying colors, except for the brakes.  He did the brakes for me, and I had to replace the alternator, also. It runs like a charm.  It is economical getting great gas mileage.  It does average about 25 mpg.

     My next car will also be a Cavalier.    <br><br>
