I bought my '90 Cougar used in 1993, when my '83 Buick Regal went bye-bye to the scrap heap.  I loved that Buick (lovingly called the F19 Strike Regal), but the transition to the Cougar was very easy.

Like my old Regal, sitting in the Cougar is the height of comfort - all the more impressive because it's not billed as a luxury car.  The standard V6 engine gives you the freedom to move around in most traffic situations.  The acceleration won't make you dizzy, but it's more than enough to ramp on to the freeway.  It's very easy to speed in this car, since the engine is quite smooth, and responsive at higher speeds.  The car is very solidly built, handles great on the standard wide tires (especially for its size), and has tight steering.

I also love the distinctive look of the Cougar (which is a sister-model to the Ford Thunderbird of the same year).  Cars today all look the same.  I happen to very much dislike the new version of the Cougar, which looks just like every other sporty coupe on the road today.

I'm not sure how much of a problem this has been in the model as a whole, but I had to have the transmission rebuilt at around 55,000 miles, which was just under the warranty.  I haven't any significant problems since (I'm at 129,000), but it doesn't always fill me with confidence, either.

The windshield wipers are awful.  It doesn't matter how new they are, they'll start streaking in a matter of months.  Because of this, I highly endorse the Vision Blade product (makes water bead and roll off).

All in all, my Cougar has been a very trusty companion.  I drive fast, and I like to be comfortable doing it.  For those reasons, the Cougar is a perfect car for me.<br><br>
