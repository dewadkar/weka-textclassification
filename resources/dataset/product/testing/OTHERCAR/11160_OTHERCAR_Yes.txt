            I have owned my 2001 RAV4 5-speed for a year and almost 11,000 miles now. I am extremely happy with this vehicle. Whether touring the back country or commuting to work this mini-SUV makes the ride a pleasure. It handles quite well for a high center of gravity car, I've never felt like it was getting away from me in a turn. Very easy to park because of it's size and although it doesn't have as much cargo room as a CRV I've never been at a loss for space, even carrying my bike in the back with the rear seat folded up.

The engine gets most of it's power above 4000 RPM's and it just loves to wind out when getting up to speed on the highway. 70 MPH = 3000 RPM's in 5th gear and that seems a tad high for me but I still average 26 MPG all the time, higher during extended road trips.

I doubt I'd like this car with an auto trans. The engine has enough juice when you attend to the gears properly but I suspect that the torque converter would rob you of enough power to make the car feel underpowered with the auto. The 5 speed trans shifts accurately and easily, the clutch feels solid  and the brakes work very well and smoothly indeed. 

Seats are quite comfortable and nicely adjustable. I don't find the engine noise objectionable but if you're used to a very quiet luxury car this will sound louder to you. The CD/cassette/radio is OK but very bass-heavy for my tastes. A little EQ adjustment helps a lot. 

100,000 mi. before any real maintenence is necessary on this VTEC engine is a real plus! I got this with the standard accessory package (AC, Stereo, etc.) for well under 20K and considering I've driven many different cars and trucks in the past 35 years I am really satisfied with this car and I'd do it again.
