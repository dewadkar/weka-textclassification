            The Chrysler Concorde is one of the most luxurious cars that I have ever ridden in.  Equipped with enough room to stretch out and take a nap.  The front seats have plenty of leg-room with manual adjustable seats.  The back seats have tons of room.  Even for adults,  there is plenty of room to sit without having to bother the person in the front to move their seat up.  

The Concorde is fully equipped with power steering, brake, automatic windows, cruise control, remote entry, tilt steering, AM/FM cassette standard (optional CD player in dash), huge trunk with a cargo net, and 4-wheel disc brakes.  

This Chrysler engine is a 200 horsepower V6, with an automatic 4-speed transmission.  This car is pretty quick for its size.  At about 3500 pounds, its acceleration from 0-60 is a little under 10 seconds.  The engine is outstanding; however, it has to reach a very high RPM level for maximum acceleration.  You need almost 6000 RPMs to reach full acceleration.

With all the speed, you wonder why it is all there.  The Concorde has one of the quietest rides that I have ever felt.  When riding in town of leisurely, you feel like you are in a whole new world.  The world seems to be working around you.  The smooth ride gives an ultimate luxury to the Chrysler Concorde.

I would recommend this luxury car because of all its features at a reasonable price.  With its sleek look, and smooth ride you cannot go wrong.  Believe me, you have yet to ride in style until you ride in the Chrysler Concorde!<br><br>
