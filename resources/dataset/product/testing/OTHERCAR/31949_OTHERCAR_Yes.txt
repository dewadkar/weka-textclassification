            I purchased a 2003 Jetta TDI GL two weeks ago.  After driving it for a few days, I took it on an 8-hour (one way) weekend roadtrip.  This car is a joy to drive and is especially good when you go to fill up.  It gets 49 mpg hwy and you don't have to fill up for about 600 miles.  I commute 102 miles a day and this car is going to cut my fuel costs by 1/3 according to my calculations.  

Volkswagen has a reputation recently for including luxury and safety features standard, and this car has them all (power everything, airbags--including sidecurtain, antilock brakes, daytime running lights, etc.).  I opted for the Monsoon stereo upgrade, which was a good choice, it sounds great.  

What surprised me overall was the solidness of the ride and the quiet compared with the Japanese car I traded in.  It has a smooth, solid, and silent highway ride.  

My only disappointments are that there is no rear cupholder.  Also, I am tall and when I put the driver's seat all the way back, there is not much legroom for people in the back seat.  That being said, the seat goes back further than my previous car, so I am more comfortable overall and don't mind putting the seat back up a bit when I have a rearseat passenger.  

This is not the diesel car of the past, people have a bad stereotype that diesels are smelly and bad for the environment.  This car runs quietly and most argue that today's modern diesel engines are better for the environment in some ways than gas engines.  A good source of information and opinion is Fred's TDI club (http://www.tdiclub.com) a group of TDI enthusiasts who discuss everything TDI.  If you search for just about anything TDI-related in the forums, you will find lots of resources about this car.

In summary, I love my car, test drive one and you will be sold!
