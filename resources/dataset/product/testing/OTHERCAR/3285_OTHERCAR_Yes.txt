            I bought my Talon (TSi/AWD loaded) in 1998 because it was a great deal. The car had 30k miles and was in great condition. After talking the dealership down to $14,000 I was ready to ride with my new Talon and have had tons of fun with the car since.

SPEED:
This car has it. The car is small and light compared to most V8 powered sports cars and the 210hp packs a punch. The car is faster than any stock V8 Mustang and has shown it many times, the Cobra is a different story as it has put a whipping on my car.

The new Eclipse GT whimpers compared to this old style 4 cyl. turbo AWD, despite claiming to have 200 hp.

INTERIOR:
This car is designed for four people, two people confortably. Unless you have friends that are about 5 ft. tall don't expect them to sit in the back seat and be convertible. Anyone over 5' 5&quot; will hit there head on the rear window when you hit a hard bump, I know from experience.

The seats are great. They have build in lumbar and side adjustments. This is a luxury car in the front seat. The placement of driving controls is desirable, yet not confusing as some cars have proven to be.

FEEL:
The car has great control. Weather it is power in the strait away or speed around corners this car delivers. The steering wheel gives great a feel of the road.

The gear box is my favorite part of driving this car. It snaps into gear in a indescribable way. 

The clutch has some hardness, as a sports car should. It is not like a Honda clutch which a two year old can press to the floorboard with minimal effort.

Finally, yes you can feel every bump in the road. To me that is what a sports car should feel like, however it is not annoying by making long trips hard on your body.

PROS and CONS:
This car is fun to own and drive. It also has many safety features. The AWD is the best feature. I can drive through rain and snow with few ill effects on control. Of course you are not going to drive any car 80MPH down a road with over an few inches of snow on the ground and to expect the car to ride perfectly, that is crazy. This car will allow you to maintain control and will not slide. The ABS is great too. This car will stop on a dime and you maintain control because the car is not sliding all over the road.

Although this is a fun sports car, it does have some drawbacks. 

The car is SMALL. There is not much room for anything. If you are planning on buying groceries for a small family, take another car. The car is also expensive, both off the lot and on repairs. I have, without pride, spent $140 on a O2 sensor and hope that nothing else goes bad. I have had some problems with the electronics. I have had to take the door apart a couple of times to blow the dust out of the power door lock connectors, good thing that was all they needed. The power is at times overwhelming. I have been going down the freeway numerous times and looked down at the speedometer and found myself going over 80mph. You have to pay attention to what you are doing because this car has the power to get you into a mess at times. Also parking is sometimes not as easy as you would expect in a little car. The AWD will restrict turning radius and make U-turns on a small street exciting.

I love to drive this car. I have had more fun driving this car than driving any other car. To me that was worth the price.<br><br>
