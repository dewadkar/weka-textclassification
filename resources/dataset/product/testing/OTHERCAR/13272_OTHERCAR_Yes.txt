            I have worked a lot of different processes making the Hondas. From the transmissions to my  current job of making fuel tanks and frames. They are a very well built car! We have had a new Honda since about the year 1985. I learned to drive in a brand new Honda and I will be buying a Honda as soon as I get a couple of checks under my belt. I think the BEST thing about Honda is that more often than not, an american Honda is AMERICAN made unlike a lot of other of the 'American made' cars that are built in Mexico and Canada. They are very safe with the driver and passanger side airbags *remember children should always be in the backseat!* The new Hondas have LOTS of room in them, both driver/passenger room and trunk room. They have a trunk release inside the trunk *in case you ever get hijacked and thrown in the trunk or you child gets in there* They have made the interior more eye friendly, I think. All around I think that at Honda we are doing an excellent job of knowing what people want in their cars!<br><br>
