               My Durango is my second SUV, my first being a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I loved the Jeep but wanted more seating room. I originally looked at the Durango only because of the extra seating room it offered and the way it looked, but soon found out there was a lot more to it than that!! The Durango offers a very nice ride, much more like a car than a truck.

   One of the things I like most about the Durango is it's versatility . I often am carting around more than my own three children and the third seat allows me to pack a lot of kids in the car but have everyone securely  buckled in. With this seat down, I can carry a large amount of groceries or supplies for home or garden projects.
    
   The only drawback I can find to the Durango is the poor gas mileage. I average about 14 miles to the gallon and do mostly &quot;stop and go&quot; driving. When taking a trip, my highway mileage is a little bit better.<br><br>
