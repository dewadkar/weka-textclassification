            I never thought I would be one to like a minivan, but I must say the convenience is great.  Having 2 kids, you really don�t need a mini van, but when they want to take friends along, one almost becomes a necessity.
	What drew us to the Silhouette was price.  We looked at the Hondas ( try and get one ), and the Toyota ( Used ones are about $1,000 less than new ones) Sure a new Silhouette will set you back $30,000 or more, but one less than 6 months old sets you back about $16,000  But there is a price to pay for not spending the �big bucks� 
	Our van had about 13,000 miles on it, and CarFax said it was an A title that was owned by a dealership in upstate New York.  You never know with a used car, but a good bet.  My first concern was that it was in an accident, as the body panels didn�t line up real well.  I had a mechanic buddy look it over, and he gave it a clean bill of health,  If it was in an accident, he said that did a first rate job of repairing it, as he found nothing out of the ordinary.  Later I learned that that�s just the way it was made.  You can grab the bumper and front lights and move them with ease.  Go ahead try it on one.  I did this on a few in dealer lots, and sure enough, they all do this.  Probably they saved an extra $0.04 on a few extra fasteners.
	As the van is my wife�s primary vehicle,  I really didn�t look at it too closely other than the inspection by my buddy.  It wasn�t until I drive it a few times that the total lack of power on hills proved itself.  It is fine on straight and level, but on hills, especially on a highway, forget it.  The expressway on-ramp by our house is on a fairly steep hill.  I can easily hit 70MPH in my car before the end of the fairly short merge apron.  In the van, it is on the floor, and finally hits 70 just before the hill crests about 1/2 mile away.  We live in a fairly hilly region, with the cruise on, the transmissions is constantly shifting in and out of over drive, and that is without holding the preset speed.  Occasionally it shifts into 2nd gear just to hold 60MPH, and that is with the cruise set at 70MPH.  My car will hold 70MPH on the same stretch of road, and I never have to shift out of 5th gear.  I know this is a van, but it should at least hold it�s own without making the engine seem like it wants to jump out of the hood.  On level roads, and around town it is just fine.  The brakes on it are effective, but very spongy, and give no feedback.  To me it feels like there is air in the lines, but it was checked, and given a clean bill of health. ( see below for possible cause)
	The ride is mostly quite, that is what you can hear over the interior noise.  Speaking of the interior; it is fairly well laid out. This van is loaded with all the goodies.  All the buttons, and switches have icons and are hard to figure out, but once you fiddle with them, you know which button, switch is for what.  The seats are a bit too soft for my liking, and the lumbar support is non-existent, but are fine for short trips.  I think a lot of the interior noise comes from the poorly fit interior trim.  You can see the painted metal around all the doors where the trim doesn�t exactly line up.  I did look at other GM mini vans, and they all had this, so I think this is by design.  The other trim looks like it is just snap fitted.  Actually a few pieces already fell off, and they just snapped back on.  The only option that wasn�t on the van was the entertainment package.  We did get a portable VCR/TV combo at Circuit City for less than $200, and it fits between the 2 front seats with ease.  The 3rd row passengers can�t see it, but 99% of the time that is not an issue.  This has been one of the best investments.  Sure makes a long trip with the kids enjoyable.
	One really nice feature about the van is the way the seats can be moved all around.  We have the 2 captains chairs in the middle, ( actually the one is a little wider than the other)  and 2 separate seats in the back, that holds 3 kids, and car seats, just fine.  The rear seats fold down, (60-40 split)  and slide up against the middle seats.  This makes instant room for that extra cargo you may acquire a trip to the home center, or mall.  Of all the vans we looked at, this certainly had the nicest and most convenient seating arrangement.
	One feature that at first I thought was great was the power right side door.  It seems like such a nice convenience, but did you ever try and stop one?  Go ahead try.  You can�t.  It pushed all 200lb of me up our driveway before I let go with about 3 inches between the door and jam.  Now imagine if that was your kid. You know how kids are,  I can easily see how a small child could get caught between the door and jam, or worse yet in the space between the door and the body as it is closing.  I tried to disable it, but it makes it all but impossible to close manually.  It is now a rule that my kids are not aloud to stay anywhere near the door.  They have to stand far back as it opens, and closes.  I hate to sound like an overly cautious parent, but better safe than sorry.  I�m really surprised more has not been said about this.
	Even though the fit and finish is poor, I could accept it better if the darned thing was more reliable.  We have had it about 7 months now and so far it has been in the shop for:
Door latch recall (twice) 
Back brakes never adjusted properly, and adjusters needed replaced
Radio/CD quit working
Cruise control quit working
Electronic display went out
Power steering pump whines real bad.  Started only when it was cold, then progressed to all the time. (morning sickness as the call it)

I never go for an extended warranty, but after owning this van for a month we opted for the 100,000 mile warranty.  $800.00 well spent I�m betting.
As far as PM, I usually do this myself.   Changing the oil is a real hassle at best, (Use a plastic wrench as the hot for the starter is dangerously close to the filter.  Ask me how I know )  and the air filter is even worse.  We even took the van to the dealer as I had to wrestle to get the airfilter out, and couldn�t get the new one in.  It was a Saturday, but we took it to the dealership and the guy there just scratched his head when we asked how to get the new one back in.  When in doubt read that fine manual�it shows you in there how to replace it.  I did have to change the front brakes at 21,000  miles.  It was a used car so I don�t think this was an indication of brake like.  This was a very easy job.  It was while doing this, that I noticed that the back breaks were brand new.  The shoes weren�t the slights bit worn, and the adjusters were stripped out.  Since the dealership replaced the back adjusters, the braking isn�t as spongy, but still a little too soft for my liking.  I also think this had something to do with the premature wearing of the front brakes.  My question is, why didn�t Mr Good wrench who checked the brakes before notice this?
	Far the size of the van, I was really impressed with the gas mileage.  19 is city which is about normal, but we get about 26 on the highway.
	Sure I may seem nit picky, but we traded in a Subaru with 80,000+ miles, and it never gave is a bit of a problem, original brakes too.  I also have a Maxima with 64,000+ miles and so far it has not been in the shop once.  This van is a stark contrast in regards to reliability, and fit and finish to me.  I do like the convenience of a mini van, only if it wasn�t plagued with so many mechanical issues.
