            I just purchased the XK8 Convertible and it is by far the sexiest car
I have ever driven.....

The lines of this car are absolutely perfect.....it glides along the
road easily and handles like a dream.  It has a nice smooth ride compared
to most other sports cars and has such POWER.....

The interior is class all the way...from the leather seats to the wood
grain dash...they've thought of everything.....

I purchased the integrated hands free phone system which is very handy
and I also got the upgraded wire wheels....I love the way everything
can be handled right from the steering wheel....changing from radio to
telephone to cd's.....changing radio stations or cd tracks.....voice
activicated phone system...it's just super...

I also love the ease in which you can raise and lower the convertible
roof......

So far...I have nothing but good things to say about this car...

Also.....I have to say...I am MUCH prettier in this car...hehehe
