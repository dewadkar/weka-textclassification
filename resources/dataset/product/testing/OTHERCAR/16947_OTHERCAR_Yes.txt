            I bought my first OUTBACK in 1995 and was the first person in my town to have one. My town has a drive-on beach and at first I was told by the Harbor Master that I shouldn't try my OUTBACK on the sand. I did and I have never gotten stuck...unlike the drivers of Explorers and Suburbans! The first year I was on the beach with my Outback I had very little time to read my book because of all the people who stopped to ask questions about my car. Now I have another OUTBACK and am no longer the only one on the beach ..they have become a very popular car in  town. I originally bought this car because I didn't want a big car but I did want All-Wheel drive security. My oldest daughter was a new driver at the time and I wanted to feel secure that she had a safe car when she was driving, no matter what the weather. Oh, if you don't have sand to drive on it is wonderful in the snow.I have never shoveled my driveway since getting this car! I live in N.E. and we have plenty of snow and it goes through anything! My next car will be a SUBARU!and the next and the next!<br><br>
