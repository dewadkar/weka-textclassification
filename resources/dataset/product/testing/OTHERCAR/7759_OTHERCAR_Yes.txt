            The <b>BMW 3-series</b> is not a �value-priced� car. I read that BMW has the largest profit margin of all car manufacturers � 11% of the car�s price is BMW�s profit.

The <b>325i</b> sedan prices start around <b>$27-28K</b> and if you want options (that are long time standard equipment in the econo-segment cars), the price will go all the way to $38K mark. 

For example: the car has a tape player as a standard equipment (like we are still in 80�s), CD player will set you back extra $170. The cruise control costs $405, fog lights - $220, fold down rear seats - <b>$405</b>. Even the metallic paint costs <b>$405</b> extra.

So if you are mostly concerned with the �bang for the buck�, check out Acura 3.2TL or CL � it has all these goodies standard for around $28K. And Type-S produces 260hp.

Other competitors include Audi A4 (lower-priced, better interior and features, but FWD base models, less power, worse crash test results), Mercedes C-Class (nice exterior, but slow, no manual transmission with C320, soft suspension, steering), Lexus IS300 (nice interior, but no manual transmission, stiff suspension).

But if you have money and are willing to spend, BMW 325 is a good choice. In creation of their �ultimate driving machine�, BMW engineers did not do compromises. The car has rear wheel drive (you can also get an all-wheel drive "xi" model), which is better for weight distribution, turning diameter, acceleration and handling in turns, but worse suited for slippery conditions than the front-wheel drive cars.

The engine is a straight-6, which has advantages over the V-6 design: inline-6 engines has significantly less vibrations (second-level vibrations are absent), it is more smooth, has less friction (there is only one bank of cylinders and twice less camshafts to deal with), cheaper in production and lighter. But it�s longer than V-6, which limits the use of inline-6 architecture.

The power is up to <b>184</b> hp at 6000 RPM, the torque is a little down at <b>175</b> lb-ft @ 3500 RPM than the last year�s model. 

These numbers produce <b>7.0</b> seconds 0-60 time with a manual 5-speed transmission. This transmission is very easy to operate and I like it very much, unlike Audi A4�s, which has somewhat "disconnected" feel and long travel. The clutch pedal is very easy to operate, unlike Mercedes C-Class'.

The car is highly rated for crash protection by crashtest.com, it has front, side and head airbags, ABS, traction control, Dynamic Stability Control. The best safety feature is very rigid body structure.

The car has A/C, power windows and locks, intermittent wipers, theft-deterrent system, remote keyless entry as standard equipment. The stereo does not produce good sound. And the cabin space is tight � especially if you are tall.

I think the dash looks cheap and the color coordination can be improved (here you cannot beat Audi), also I don�t like the center-located window switches. But the company had to do some cost-cutting to make this 11% profit margin, right?

The car drive really good, even on the bumpy roads. Suspension is somehow both stiff (for good cornering) and cushy on uneven roads. The engine, which uses variable valve timing, is very �driveable�.

The maintenance interval is determined by the computer, so instead of guessing or changing your oil every 3000 miles, you wait till computer tells you to change the oil, which (depending on driving conditions) usually happens at 15,000+ mile intervals. BMW covers the maintenance for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles.

The 330 is much more powerful (around 225 horses vs. 184), but the 325�s power is enough (consider 7.0 sec. 0-60 time), especially if you have a stick shift. Besides, paying $7,000 extra for 330's 0.5 liter of displacement does not seem like a good deal.

<i>I am still thinking if I should buy the 325 (I'm also considering Audi A4), but if you do it, I am jealous.</I>
