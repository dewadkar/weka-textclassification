            First off a bit about me. My most recent car was a Volvo 960 (great and reliable car) I have also owned and/or driven at length: Audi A6 Quatro, BMW 750IL-740IL-Z3, Nissan Maxima, Lexus ES, Ford Taurus, Mazda 929.

Of all the cars I have owned...that darn Volvo 960 has been my favorite. 101,000 miles and no signs of slowing down or aging. Beautiful paint and very very comfortable seats for a big guy like me 6' and 250 lbs (yeah, I am working on the 250 number !!)

I went to Acura to look at that new little RSX job Great car for a lease price of 249 a month (how can you not look at it)  I drove it, loved it and was about to do the deal, when I said, "Ya know, that TL looks pretty cool, how much for that?" with a toss of the keys and one test drive with the Mrs...it was a done deal. the 2002 Acura 3.2 TL in Satin Silver with Black Leather interior was mine (or at least for the next 48 months as I have leased it)

First trip was up to the Races at Saratoga, NY.  About a 4 hour ride for me.... Car just wants to fly, it begs you to step on the gas and will go 0-60 in under 8 seconds (and this is the regular Non Type S model)
This car likes to go 80+ MPH (heck, the speedometer goes to 160!)  The ride is firm yet forgiving (a nice blend of sport and luxury)  If you read MKARESH's negative review of the S series model, I really think that the 17" tires on the S type he drove - coupled with 40 PSI (overinflated) tires caused his fillings to come loose...I really hope he re-test drives another that is configured properly)

Things I like or really like:
Leather interior, seats, heated seats, heated mirrors, in dash 6 CD changer, cup holders, select-o-shift-o-matic thing  (shift on the fly) very fast moon roof, self adjusting rear view mirror, power outlets, lighted center console box, seat belts height adjustment, and more

Things that bugged me:
Every car has flaws...this one has two.
1) Bose sound system is a disappointment.  The Audi A6 Bose system is way better.  The Acura has speakers in each door, and a sub-woofer in the rear deck.  It is listenable, but should be a lot better in a $30,000 automobile.
2) Rear seats don't fold down.  There is a small passthru for skis or a 2x4 but don't plan any trips to the lumber yard with this baby.

Overall:  I paid 28,900 for this car, and am leasing it for 4 years.  It has a phenominal residual value of 56% after 4 years.  My monthly nut is $330 bucks (yeah, I put a little money down)

I am so delighted with this car but have conceded that I will have two challenges.
1) keeping the black interior clean (but, man it looks good)
2) not getting a ticket...this thing is so fun to drive, and so fun to drive fast...the MXV4 have a tenacious grip on the road !!! And by the way...I got 28 MPG on my first long trip...I couldn't believe it!!!  Acura is working some serious magic here!
