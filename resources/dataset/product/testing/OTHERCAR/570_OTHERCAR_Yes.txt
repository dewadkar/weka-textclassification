            I bought this vehicle because of the excellent warranty, the affordability, the excellent gas mileage and Hyundai's reputation for building a quality car.  I have had my car for just about a year and have had absolutely no problems with it whatsoever!  The only thing I have had to deal with is the regular oil changes.  The ride is smooth and quiet for a small car.  People who should buy this car are those that want a good first car that gets good gas mileage and those without children.  People who shouldn't buy this car are those who need more room and want more power.<br><br>
