            We bought our 95 Grand Am V-6  new 6 years ago, and it has been a wonderful car. It now has nearly 130,000 miles on it, has never had a tune up (I know, I know), and STILL gets 27 miles/gallon. In the time we have had this car, our repair costs have been extremely minimal-- less than $500. It drives wonderful and is very well made. I can say that with confidence considering that our Grand Am has been thru 1 frontal crash, and 1 frontal/side impact and still drives nearly as well as when we bought it. Something to be aware of however: there was a mandatory recall involving the ignition switch earlier this year, so anyone considering buying one should make sure the free repair service was done on the car. Now, my only problems with my car have involved the front radio speakers (not working-- I have been told some of these cars have wires that come loose and simply need to be hooked back up, however, taking the door apart has not proved to be an easy task) and the passenger front power lock which will not unlock automatically (it will lock). As far as I am concerned, these are two very minor things, and should not weigh heavily against the car. The 95 Grand Am is an economical, affordable, roomy car that is fun to drive and sporty to look at. The back seat has plenty of room for two car seats and a person in the middle as well. There is ample leg room for adults to ride comfortably in the back seat without having to move the front seats up against the dash and make it a tight ride for them. Resale/trade in value is also extremely good on these cars.
