            OK, I know it's telling my age, but I owned two Beetles back in the 70's. Souped them up with over sized tires, bored out engine blocks and sported headers that made my wheels the hottest bug in town. Of course the really hot cars were the 'Cudas and the GTO's. So when I drove the VW I had my expectations of what the Beetle had to offer. I was shocked! The model I drove was 5 speed manual transmission which I found to be ultra smooth to transverse between gears. The engine shocked me at it's power delivered on demand! I remember my Dad saying that "Volkswagen's only had two speeds, stop and all out!" ( it's was a wonder that he allowed me behind the wheel of one much less made one available to me as my set of wheels.) He had no concept of what all out could be in a VW. The speedometer registers 120 and the Beetle delivers every bit of it. It is plain to see that this vehicle can afford it's owners as many speeding tickets as he desires. I took it out on the speedway and loved every moment. Unlike the old version of Beetle the new Beetle's 2.0 liter 115 horse power engine is located in the front. The weight being in the front lends to a lot more stable front end. No temptation for the bug's front end to plane by gusts of air due to high speeds or being passed speeding eighteen wheelers. The new VW Beetle claims it's place on the highway and maintains it's own.  I found myself falling in love all over again. 
<b>Satisfaction</b>
I interviewed owners of Beetles and learned that they all were in love with their vehicles. Loyalty to the Beetle is still the same. You either love them or hate them, some thing never change.
The depreciation of the Volkswagen Beetle is very good although I did find an extremely low milage vehicle on a used car lot for a scarey far to low sticker. 
<b>Engine</b>
The VW Beetle for 2000 offers a new  turbocharged 1.8 liter, 150 horse power Four and there is a 90 horse power turbodiesel engine.
The volkswagen Beetle has proven itself in the crash test and has side curtain air bags in the 2001.
Seating is still limited with two in front and two in the rear, but I was very comfortable as I drove the bug down the highway and in the city traffic. It has front wheel drive and with the engine in the front delivers the power to the shaft far more efficiently.  The 29 miles per gallon of gas is as I remember it as I drive up to the pumps (gas prices are a lot different though). It has a 14.5 gallon tank and be bought with a 5 speed manual transmission or with the 4 speed automatic. You owe it to yourself to drive the manual as it is so smooth it makes the shifting a pleasurable experience. the VW length is 161 inches, wheelbase of 99 inches, and width of 68 inches. The vehicle is very easy to enter as it's door top to ground height is 51.5 inches. You have room to spare when executing a 180 turn on a two lane highway (even my sister could do it). The VW Beetle weighs in at 2,780 with it's weight distributed 64/36 front to back axel. I has a 13.0 cubic foot luggage capacity. 
The new VW Beetle is very impressive, however the reliability record has been less than impressive. Even though this is true it's owners cling to their VW loyalty and promise to buy again and again.
Trim line of the Beetle: GL ,GLS, GLS TDI,GLS 1.8T, Sport, GLX 1.8T
And goes from 15,900 to 21,175 but don't expect to horse trade the VW dealers are like Saturn Dealers the sticker price is what you pay. Keep in mind that people lined up to put their names on a list to get the first year issue of this car and they understood that they got no choice of color. Try it, but be prepared to fall in love.
