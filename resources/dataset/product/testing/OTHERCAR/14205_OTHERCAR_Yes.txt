            The G20 is making a comeback after being dropped in 1997 and should spice up Infiniti's line. It looks far racier than the 1991-96 model, which was a competent, but rather bland, overlooked entry level Infiniti. The G20's styling is fashionable, with a wedge silhouette, short hood and long cabin. The front end is set off with an agggressively slanted nose, distinctive Infiniti Q45-style grille and jewel-like headlights. This is what i like to call a SPORTURY car, has the capability to be souped up into a fast little devil, but at the same time the leather on your butt and the quite drive noise feels good.
