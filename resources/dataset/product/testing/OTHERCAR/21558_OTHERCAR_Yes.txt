            I purchased a 1997 Eldorado ETC off lease in January 1999.  The outstanding feature is the responsive 300 hp V-8 coupled with a very tight automatic transmission. The acceleration is far above average and the automatic traction system that engages in tight turns is a pleasure although a bit scary the first time it engages. The sound reminds one of a transmission grinding.
The luxury package is what you should expect in this class of automobile but like most American cars I have owned there are always a few rattles that are disappointing at this cost level. There are innumerable extras that cover nearly all comfort luxuries and are standard. However consider the sun roof option because it gives one a sense of convertible atmosphere without being blown about. The back seat is a bit tight if you have grown children.
Finally the gas mileage is the most surprising feature. About town I average 17-18 mpg but on a recent six thousand mile trip through the western United States I averaged 24-25 mpg, and this with an explosive 300 hp engine.
In summary this is a very good car for a couple without children who are considering travel or just want a good looking luxury coupe with plenty of go.<br><br>
