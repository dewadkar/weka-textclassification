            "Where Are The Cars We Were Promised?" That's the way Infiniti is marketing its new G35, Q45, FX45, and M45.  I don't personally think that the G35 fits into that commercial very well... it really doesn't do very much that other premium luxury sedans do.  Some of the other Infinitis have Laser guided cruise control and rear view backing cameras... that could possibly be inserted into that 'Cars we were promised' category.

The G35 is the most recent of my toys to replace my '02 Mercedes ML320.  I requested the dealer not add the front tag bracket, despite it being against Maryland law.  The front tag, like on my Audi TT destroys the liquidness of the car's lines.

The front of the G35 is somewhat 'whimpy' when compared to   the radical design of the back.  We can also see this on the G35's distant cousin, the Nissan Altima.  The rear end of the G35 has all LED (Light emitting diodes) for the side markers, rear tail lights, rear brake lights, and the high mount brake light.  LEDs ignite faster and brighter than conventional auto bulbs, and easily translates into at least 30 feet of extra stopping distance for the car behind.  Incredible safety feature, saw first on the Mercedes S Class, and in third brake light way before that.  The front, has nothing too special about it.  There are no LEDs or no eye catching designs.

A feature that a handful of cars has that I detest is integrated foglights.  This G35 has foglights integrated into the main headlight assembly, so at first glance it looks like you have NO foglights.  Of course foglights are only cosmetic, they do add to character.  The Xenon HID headlights on the G35 needed a slight adjustment up to improve visibility.  High beams are whimpy, to my standards... coming from an SUV with generation II bi-xenon headlights.

The rear trunk lid is disturbed by the latch's housing which is a piece of plastic that mounts flush with the trunk lid.  It also bears the Infiniti logo and name.  Looking at pictures, the G35 coupe (arriving November 2003) does not have this 'piece' of plastic.  One must see this to see what disturbance it plays on the car.

Seventeen inch wheels that are 215mm thick are standard on this car with the premium package, which 99% of G35s come with.  The Aero/Sport package adds a different variety of wheel (5 spokes) with the same stats.

The leather on the interior is a mid grade leather, with leatherette headrests and leatherette seatbacks.  I do not envision this leather variety to be very durable.

The Bose sound system paired with the 6-disc in dash changer upsets me.  There is a lot of distortion and bass is not as brilliant as I've heard in other cars.  If there is anything... and I do mean anything left in the side pockets in this car - the speakers will cause it to rattle.  The speakers rattle the doors as well, which means there isn't much padding in the door to support the speakers.  This is a 7 speaker system, with a woofer in the rear deck.  Radio reception is only fair.

Infiniti turns an old trick into reality, the instrument cluster and steering wheel move up and down together.  Say goodbye to blocked speedometers and gauges!  Inter

Infiniti's optional DVD navigation system pops up out of the center dash at the touch of a button.  Voice commands come from a sleepy woman with a pleasant liquid human sounding voice.  The DVD holds the entire US and Canada.  Gone are the days of touch screen, and say hello to the joystick!  Argh, not very easy, but seems like everyone is doing it.  When the navigation screen is popped up, it blocks the Infiniti signature analog clock, but an on-screen digital read out of the time replaces that.  The digital clock is synced with the GPS's time.

Dual zone climate control comes with the premium package, and works well.  There are two vents for the rear occupants - bad air output.  The two step heated seats take a little while to heat up, but are real kidney burners when they get started... the only thing hotter is an Audi seat heater.

This car is what Nissan/Infiniti call 'Front midship platform'.  The engine sits about one foot from the front of the car, which makes more room for the front wheel wells.  The wheelbase on the G35 is the same as the Q45, and interior space is excellent!  The back seat room is far better than the Volvo S40, Audi A4, and BMW 3 series.  Good job Infiniti!  The rear seats recline too!

Infiniti has a first aid kit in this car, complete with a feminine napkin.  Why?  Roadside emergency?!

Full size spare... good good.

I also have the wood package which adds a genuine maple wood trim on all the interior door pulls, and the gear shifter.  If you don't go with the wood, it simply leaves the standard stainless steel looking trim on those surfaces... it looks good either way.  The Aero/Sport package adds more stainless steel looking trim on the entire center console.  

I'm very happy with the 260 HP.  She sails 0-60 in 5.9 seconds, and has excellent high end power.  The Lexus IS300 has awful high end power, after 55 MPH the engine needs more and more time to get up to higher speeds.  C'mon, 0-60 in 5.9 is good for a 5 speed automatic!!!

I think Infiniti is headed in the right direction with their new lineup of cars.  We shall see where they go...

This is a MY2003 car, but epinons.com only goes as high as 2002!
