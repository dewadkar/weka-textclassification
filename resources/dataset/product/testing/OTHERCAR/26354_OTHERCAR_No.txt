            This Sony is the second digital camera that I have bought. My first was a Nikon Coolpix 775. I loved that camera. Unfortunately, it developed some sort of internal error and had to be returned after a year of taking great pictures. I had an important family gathering the next day, so I was forced to search for a replacement without much time for research. The Sony was the closest in features and price that Best Buy had in stock. 

This camera does have some great features. It is a convenient size. Not too large, and not so small that its hard to hold onto. The screen is a good size, and you can zoom in really close when you are reviewing your pictures. You can even crop pictures on your camera. I do not like to use digital zoom because it decreases the quality of the picture, so I was excited that this camera has the option of turning off the digital zoom so you do not use it accidentally. The quality of the pictures is great when you have good natural lighting. The pictures that we took outdoors could not have been much better and the battery life is very good. You have a lot of warning that the battery is getting low, so you do not have to worry about the camera dying right before you take an important picture. 

However, there were several things that I was not so pleased with. The control pad is sometimes hard to navigate. It is set up like a compass, with four arrows, and you press in the middle to make your selection. The only problem is that it is so small that it is easy to accidentally press one of the other arrows when you are trying to press straight down. The time when this is particularly irritating is when you are reviewing your pictures to choose which ones you want to delete. You have to delete each picture one at a time. That gets old fast. The lens position was a little awkward too. It is all the way over on the left side, so I felt like I did not have a good place to put my fingers on that side of the camera without interfering with the picture. The memory stick included is only 16MB, so you will have to spend more money to get higher memory. I bought the 64MB memory stick ($49) and it will hold about forty-five pictures on the highest quality settings. The battery does take forever to charge, but it seems to last well too. The main reason that I am not keeping this camera is because of inconsistent results with the flash. It has three flash levels (High, Normal,Low)to choose. My problem was that the flash often seems too harsh. It creates too much contrast in parts of the picture, with the flash glaring back off of everything. If I set the flash on low, the pictures came out too dark and the color quality was poor. The quality of the lighting was also different depending on whether I was zoomed in or not. I never had these problems with my other camera, but it had lots of different scene modes which made taking great pictures easy. This camera only has three scene modes to choose (night, night portrait, and landscape)--a little disappointing. 

This is not a bad camera at all, but I will most likely return this camera and wait for the shipment of the Nikon 4300 to come in because my experience with my other Nikon was so positive.
