            Okay, I'm not going to make this lengthy.  I recently purchased a pre-owned 1997 Avenger ES at a local dealership.  The car is decked out with all options except the bigger engine. (I have the 2.0 liter V6).  I come from a long line of POS late models, and this car has been great so far.  I've never had to bring it into a shop yet except for routine maintenance.  The seating up front is great, the back seems tight, but I've been able to get 4 big guys into it w/o a complaint.  The transmission is the smoothest I've driven, except I don't like the gear ratios all that much.  The only problem with paint is the rear spoiler, which due to it being made of a different material, the paint has faded very badly.  I have a problem with the passenger window knocking and I know I need to get my brakes done soon, but other than that, the car performs very well.  Just be prepared, this car does not turn on a dime....it makes going through a drive-thru a headache at times.
