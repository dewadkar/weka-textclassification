                In the summer of 1996 I had purchased a 1990 2.2L non-turbo Dodge Shadow!  I needed a car for my senior year of high school, so I bought the Dodge from a good friend of mine who was leaving for college.  This is a great car to buy if you’re commuting or a student!     
    In the summer time, this baby shines like new, you just have to baby the finish. Shadows that I have seen tend to rust toward the bottom of the doors and the wheel-wells.  Although I wax my car probably bi-monthly, the rust is starting exactly where everybody else’s is.  When I got the car I noticed the headlight casings where very scratchy, this impaired the brightness of the light output.  Since then I have replaced the casings and added a set of fog lights that bind everybody I go by (sorry!). 
 The stock stereo I had started out good, then it was up in smoke after a short in the system had occurred.  A few months later, I bought a mini-disc stereo and two subwoofers for the trunk.  I must tell you that the stock speakers in the car die pretty quickly, at least they act like good tweeters when a subwoofer is blasting.  Theres not a lot of truck space, especially now with the speakers in the back!  Not to mention that’s it’s pain to get the spare tire out and the insulation might be soiled and damp (eww).
The interior of my Shadow is gray and clean up nicely, I have seen the maroon interior and it can get nasty.  The seats are very comfy, so comfy you might doze off so be carefully on long road trips!  
 	I love this car although it can get expensive to pay for repairs (or should I say expensive for my Dad). Only a year after I bought the Shadow it needed an entire brake system ($890.00 with a discount), In 1998, I needed shocks ($430.00), and in 1999, a total performance muffler system was installed ($390.00).  Being that my car has a manual transmission, the clutch is wearing down quickly.  I was told if you can’t find them, grind them!  I’m going to drive the car as long as I can before having to pay ($500.00) for a new clutch.  But other then that the car rides great!
	There might be a little road noise due to not enough sound deadeners or the window insulation coming off (like mine).  Sometimes the passenger window gets disconnected from the door and falls downward into the door-well.  This only happened recently, but it's easy to snap the window back into place.  
       The 1990 Dodge Shadow gets great mpg, up to 380-400mile per tank full! To fill the tank costs about 15 bucks but it goes a long way.   The engine has got some kick (93 Horses, yeah-hoo!) and will not let you down where every you take it.  My only advise is to baby the cars finish and give 2-3month oil changes to maintain the reliability.
       Any questions about the Dodge Shadow, drop me a line.
