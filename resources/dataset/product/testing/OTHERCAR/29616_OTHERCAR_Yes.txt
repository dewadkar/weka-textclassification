            I am not a minivan lover. But this is one great van! Among many things, it is small so you don't feel like you are driving a tank or your mom's old station wagon. It is easy to move the back seat forward or back independently, allowing for easy adjustment of &quot;trunk&quot; space. But one of the big sellers for me was all the great luxuries for the price! We paid 25,000 for ours new and it has:
all leather seats, power driver and passenger front seats, rear a/c, privacy glass, Captains Chairs, SEVEN CD player, SIX speakers, sunroof, luggage rack etc. The list could go on! We have had other Nissans, so I was not (and am not) concerned about reliability.
The downsides I have found are:
The two middle Captains Chairs weight a lot; I cannot remove them alone.
The back seat is a little tight to get into, especially if you have car seats in the Captains's Chairs because then you can't slide the middle seat out of the way.
It seems to &quot;ding&quot; easily, which surprised me.
Overall, however, I HIGHLY recommend this van as a comfortable, luxurious, smooth riding vehicle at a WONDERFUL price.<br><br>
