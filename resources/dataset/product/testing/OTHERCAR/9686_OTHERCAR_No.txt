            I purchased this car used in 1996 and at that point it was already two years old.  When I purchased it, it had 26,000 miles on it.  If I knew I would have all the problems that I did, I would never have purchased it.
<p>
Ever since I purchased this car, I've had nothing but problems with it.  It started with the occasional oil leaks which were often related to the transfer case leaking.  It was recalled (in 1998 I believe) because all the oil leaks from the transfer case could cause the engine to catch fire.  The problems didn't stop there as it continued to leak oil, this time from the head gasket.  Knock on wood, but I think I finally got the oil leaks solved since it's held up over the last year.  Ironically, this was a minor problem.
<p>
In 1998, I was driving home one day from seeing the Pittsburgh Penguins play when I started having troubles shifting gears.  I was trying to back out of a parking place, but when I tried to change from park to reverse, I heard a loud cracking noise.  Well, I managed to get the car to go, but it finally died on the road.  I ended up needing the whole transmission replaced.  This was a job that cost close to $3,000!
<p>
Again knock on wood, but I haven't had any problems with the transmission since.  I still have problems though.  My car constantly pulls out of alignment.  I also need the rotors ground down twice a year.
<p>
I've had many other things done to the car at one point in time.  I had the breaks go before and they needed replaced.  I tried to adjust the air conditioning once and heard a crack.  As a result, I had to have the dials that control the air conditioning and the heat replaced.  I had to have a CV boot on the car replaced because it had cracked and if it broke completely, I would've had to have the whole axle replaced.  I even had a cracked fuel line before.  Finally, I also have exterior rusting on my car even though I've taken very good care of it.
<p>
That was just the thing I've had go wrong with the car.  I also found that the backseat is cramped and extremely uncomfortable on long rides.  It also shakes slightly at high speeds (over 100 mph).  This car is not designed for older people.  One of my mom's biggest complaints is that the car sits so low to the ground.
<p>
After all of my ranting and raving, you probably think that there is nothing good about this car, but that's not entirely true.  I find that the heat and AC controls are very easy to reach.  The front seats are very comfortable even on long rides and fit tall people (I'm 6') easily.  I have cloth seats in my car and I feel that they mold to my body somewhat.  The backseats fold down to give you extra storage room.  The car also features a passive restraint seat belt system.  The shoulder strap is automated and activates when you open and close the door.
<p>
Of course, none of the features of the car can compare to the driving experience.  This car is a treat to drive.  Although it is only a 4, you can still feel some power when you hit the gas.  It handles great on the curves and you can feel it hugging the road.  It has a sports car feel to it.  I've also found that it's not too bad in the snow.
<p>
All in all, I don't feel that the drive and the few positives outweigh the negatives.  I would highly recommend that you save your money and explore other options.
