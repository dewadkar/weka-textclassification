               We just traded in our 1990 Plymouth Sundance.  We kept the car with relatively low mileage (under 70,000) and I must say that overall we we were pretty pleased with it although there were some problems.
   On the plus side, we really never had catastrophic problems.  Visits to the shop were minimal and mostly preventative in nature.  The car also handled well and was fine for getting my husband to and from work.
   On the negative side, we never could get the rear view mirror to stay up.  We tried everything including several visits to the dealer.  The paint also began rusting through about three years ago.  And by the time we traded it in (last week) it was getting really, really poor gas mileage - about 12 miles to the gallon.  But again, it was 10 years old.
   In summary, I would not recommend buying a 1990 version but a newer model at a good price would probably hold up for a few years - perhaps as a college or first car.<br><br>
