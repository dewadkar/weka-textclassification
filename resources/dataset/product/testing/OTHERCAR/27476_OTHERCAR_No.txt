            We were extremely happy with our 1993 Sable for two years after purchase and then all hell broke loose.  At around 26,000 miles the ac kicked out and needed to be repaired.  They replaced the gaskets and hoses under warantee.  Lasted less than a year.  Went in again and had gaskets and hoses replaced again (a recall had been issued in the meantime and they replaced the gaskets and hoses again with the new revised gaskets covered in the recall).  It lasted less than a year again and now we were getting close to the end of our warantee.  This time the dealer fought with FORD and suggested that everything in the unit needed to be replaced.  Ford finally agreed.  This time it lasted 24,000 miles and the same problem arose and Ford refused to replace it and the dealer wouldn't touch it because it was past their shop warantee and Ford's warantee even though we explained that this was a continuing problem and they could see it by looking at our repair records.  20 phone calls to FORD Motor Company and 10 phone calls to the repairing dealership later I gave up.  Ford's reply was for me to fight it out with the dealership and the dealership's reply was that this was an expensive luxury (yeah, no kidding when you have to repair it 4 times in 50,000 miles) and I should expect to pay a lot to have it repaired.  No one took into account that the ac had been repaired 3x's in 36,000 miles.  They just kept repeating that the warantee was expired. I might understand this if the ac was used continuously for 12 months but I was lucky if it was used for 5 months out of a year since I live in the northeast. 

Our second problem was the head gasket:

Our head gasket blew at 72,000 miles.  No warning signs (like overheating or loosing coolant).  I was driving home from work the engine light came on and the car just jolted and died.  The entire engine needed to be replaced.  After finding out that they were recalling some 94's and newer models for the same problem we inquired with Ford if our car could possibly have the same problem.  They said they would review it and get back to us.  Their reviewing was checking the vin # and then telling us no.  They did not ask how the problem occurred or speak to the repairman to find out what damage was done to the engine (which we later discovered was the same failure as the others that prompted the head gasket recall - ex: it blew in exactly the same cylinder as the recall models).  We are still trying to fight Ford on this.

I won't even go into how many time we have replaced the brakes and rotors (consumer reports can fill you in on that one).

I have another Ford sitting in the driveway and I will say that I believe it will be my last.  My faith in Ford is lost.
