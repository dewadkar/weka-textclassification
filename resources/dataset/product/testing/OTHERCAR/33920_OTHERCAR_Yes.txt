            Really, I just sold my Land Rover and bought the Highlander because it drives better, is much more reliable, feels great, has more worthwhile features.  I've never owned a toyota and never wanted to. I hate that I own a Toyota, except for one thing:  it is better than the Range Rover, BMW and Mercedes experiences I've had, and at half the price.     

Facts:  the Highlander's leather seats are fine, comfortable.  You can only get electric control on the driver's side, a stupid decision, but I live with it.   The mileage on the 6 cylinder is more like 17 than the 22 they indicate as the high side.  But it is fast and fairly quiet.  

There is definite wind noise, and I think this is what you get for saving this much money off the bigger league competitors.   

The stereo is fabulous, 5 cd changer in the dash, great speakers, easy to control, far better than what I had on the Land Rover.

HVAC is really great too, quick, powerful, great controls.

I like the design---mine is black with a tan interior, very sharp, but I think the rear wind deflector is idiotic, has no purpose whatsoever and indicates that they think we are morons who like to pretend this thing would leave the ground without it.  On the other hand, I did buy one with it!

I also have all the anti-skid devices they offer, and I have tried them out in an empty parking lot on ice, and they really work.

I would recommend if you are used to spending more on a car, buy this with everything they offer.  You'll get the sticker up to $34,000 and they will knock $2-2500 off the price.  It's a bargain compared to the Germans and the Brits.   And it is basically the Lexus--same factory, pretty  much the same interior, same workmakship but more room and a little more masculine style.

Too bad Toyota is not cool.  That's what you really lose.  No one is impressed when you say you have one, but you sure will enjoy driving it.  And $60k for that Land Rover was a total ripoff.  There's just no justification when Toyota can deliver this package for half the price.
