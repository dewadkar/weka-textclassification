            It was time to chuck out my 1986 Subaru GL last year (1999) and I decided with two children I wanted something safe and roomy...and that had working air conditioning, a working radio, and other luxuries that my Crudaru didn't provide.  

I found the 1996 Nissan Pathfinder SE at a dealership and haggled them down to a really good price of around $16,500, considering the list was $23K on this model, I was happy with the price.  The dealership (Hays Nissan in Nashville, TN) helped considerably with getting the paperwork and cutting a deal on the price...just never ask them to detail your car.  I found out that dirt left in the cup holders means &quot;clean as a whistle&quot; to this dealership, not the Irish spring cleaning I was looking for.

WHAT IS SMOOTH:  1) The best thing about this SUV is its comfortable ride, it rides closer to a sedan than any other SUV out there (including the Mitsubishi Montero, Grand Jeep Cherokee, Chevy Jimmy and Bronco, Ford Explorer of which I all test drove). 2) The ergonomics of the interior are good and there is lots of head and leg room.  They also designed the controls well to make it easy to reach everything from the driver's seat. 3) the towing capacity is quite good and we dragged a fully loaded UHaul around the state with no problems at all (don't expect more than 10 miles to the gallon when dragging anything...see LEMON LIKE below).  4) the sound system is fair and can be loud enough for you to not hear yourself sing...that was a requirement.  If you are really into sound, get the premium sound package from the dealer, the basic is not sufficient at that point. 5) solid steel bars in doors - here's where the protection came in, they have designed the Pathfinder's sides for crashes very well. 6) the resell value is very high, did I mention they gave me $200 for my Subaru on trade in? (well...it was more like...&quot;we would have given you less, but we gave you a few extra bucks because it still started&quot;)

LEMON LIKE: 1) Unadjustable head rest...even if it was adjustable, I wouldn't have opted for the sharp piece of foam jutting into the back of my head 2) the automatic transmission is not intuitive when it comes to shifting and you will find the acceleration is very poor on larger hills 3) can you say &quot;gas guzzler&quot;? I can.  I've gotten on average about 12 miles to the gallon...really really helpful when there is a gas shortage.  Costs $25-30 to fill the tank to go 180-220 miles depending on cargo.  4) Poor visibility out the side and rear windows.  I have been in several near accidents because of Nissan's Improved Blind Spot technology...the Quality Control tester at Nissan must of had eyes on the side of his head, it is very hard to see.  Also, if you are short..I do recommend taking off the head rests on the back seats or you will have a very small &quot;T&quot; shape window to look through.  Hey, the QC must have eyes in the back of his head too!  5) CD Player buttons are coming off and the CD player occasionally doesn't want you to eject or let you play your CD's

I'm kind of torn on this SUV, I like the ride but the other problems really knock it down a few points.  I will look at the Pathfinder newer models to see if they improved when buying another SUV in the future.
