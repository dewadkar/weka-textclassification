            Whenever we fly to Kansas City to visit family and friends, we have to rent a car. This trip, we rented from Dollar rent a car and ended up with a 2003 Chrysler Concorde for the weekend. To say we were pleased with this car is an understatement. Based on this trip, my sister will be looking at possibly purchasing a Concorde for regular use. 

I've driven Chryslers over the year and have always found that they ride smooth and easy. The Concorde is no exception. Even though the one we had was a rental and has probably taken a lot of abuse, it still ran amazingly well. The ride was quiet and easy.

I really like the look of the car. While it's big, it doesn't look boxy. It has a nice profile and seems somewhat more stylish than some of the other cars I've seen in this price class. 

The Concorde has a 3.5 liter high output V6 engine with  232 HP. It has MacPherson struts which I'm told makes for better traction, and front-wheel drive. 

In researching what came standard with purchase, my sister has found that the base price of $23,000 includes A/C and heating, an AM/FM-radio with six programmable settings and a built in tape-player. It has speakers in both front and back. The sound quality is nice and crisp. It is possible to control which speakers the music plays on so that mom and dad don't have to listen to the kids' music or vice versa. This was also nice when driving home late at night. We were sleeping in the back seat and the radio didn't disturb us though it was playing in front. 

I want to comment on the A/C system. There are controls in both front and back to set the air flow. This is great. I hate being in the back seat and having to rely on the folks up front to aim the vents so I get air. The air flows directly to the back and it is possible for passengers there to control it. What a pleasure!

Speaking of the back seat...the car was really comfortable front and back. With five grown-ups in the car, no one felt cramped. My cousin David is over 6 feet tall and he wasn't bumping his head or his knees in the back seat. That's quite an accomplishment of design.

I also had a chance to drive the car both in Kansas City and on the highways around there. The car is very easy to drive and very intuitive. I didn't have to look for where things were. I've had some cars that I thought I was setting cruise control on and ended up washing my windshields. Not here. Everything is just where one would expect it to be. 

The car is an automatic which is nice though not necessary. It has power steering which is a must in my book. I don't like driving with power by armstrong when I'm dealing in big cars. It has a tilt steering wheel which means that I can really customize the car's fit to me. It also has cruise control which is great when driving between cities in Kansas where there is nothing but miles and miles of miles and miles.

On the not so hot side, this car seems to ride a bit low. This means that if the exit from the parking lot was a bit more steep than usual, the front of the car would scrape its bottom on asphalt. 

The Concorde has loads of trunk space! When we went back to drop it off, we had five people with luggage in the car. Everyone's bags fit without problem and with a bit of space to spare. 

The 2003 Concorde is roomy and well appointed. It has nice wide seats in front and a lot of leg and head room. The driver's seat can move in many different directions so that one can get set perfectly. The mirrors are nice and large. The rearview mirror includes a directional readout so even if you're lost you'll know you're heading north, or southwest. The front passenger seat can also recline all the way back.

As I mentioned before, the back is great. The seats are comfy to the point of being sleep inducing. The seat belts are easy to lock and don't seem to hit short folks right across the neck. The center seat has a seatbelt that comes from the top of the seat so that it works like a shoulder harness, too. 

A weekend with a rental car is a good test drive. We put about 400 miles on the car between going to the Bat Mitzvah and all its functions, visiting relatives, going shopping and visiting places my mother used to live, go to school, go to camp, etc. The test drive was a success. My sister is planning to make a Chrysler Concorde her next car. If I had the means, I would be doing the same.
