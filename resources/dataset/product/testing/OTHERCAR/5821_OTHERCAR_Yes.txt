            First let me tell you why I decided to purchase a digital camera. I, like so many others wanted to have control of the shooting and printing. I was tired of wasting time and shots that I did not want just to fill a roll of film. I decided on Olympus because I own an Olympus 35mm and in my opinion this company produces a quality product for a very competitive price. I do not rely totally on the written reviews because everyone standards and needs are different.  For example some of us will store our prints and view them on our computer, so if this is the case, don�t be overly concerned about the comments about the quality of prints. 
   I have taken hundreds of shots under different conditions and I am very satisfied with the quality of the pictures when printed. Do they compare with the 35mm? No and if that is what one is looking for then a digital camera should not be on your list. When taking pictures with this camera you will find that in low light situations the quality will be less. In all fairness this is true in most of digital cameras in this price range.  I have found that the features are similar with the Olympus 35mm and the learning curve was very short. This unit has many features found on more expensive cameras and in some cases it has more.  Give this careful consideration because you will need to use many of these to take good pictures.
   Some of the features that I find to be annoying are the lens cover. It will take time to get used to closing it. The flash has to be manually flipped up and in some situations you will forget and this gets to be irritating. Because you will want to use the manual settings I would have preferred it if it would not revert back to default settings when it is turned off. The photo editing program that comes with the camera is in my view very limited and you will want to purchase a better one. 
   Some comments about the price of the camera. Be prepared, as others have mentioned to pay for extras. I would suggest that you wait and use the camera for a while before you start to consider what extras you will need. For example you will not need to buy an AC adapter if you decided to purchase a USB drive. This approach will save you money. Another consideration, don�t buy extra batteries until you have shopped around. In the camera store, they wanted $14.99 for the Olympus Camedia 3v Lithium Battery. Right across the way at the mall the same battery was selling for $9.99 and I have found this to be the same for many of the extras. �Don�t be in a rush!�  One extra that I will recommend. Purchase a rechargeable unit and batteries. I have used these and they last just about as long as the more expensive ones and they will save you money. 
  Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a digital camera that will meet the standards of the industry in all areas. Printing quality, ease of use and a solid unit. Some have mentioned the plastic components. I have an Olympus 35mm and it is basically the same construction and I have had no problems over the years. You will have to exercise the same general care as any other camera.
