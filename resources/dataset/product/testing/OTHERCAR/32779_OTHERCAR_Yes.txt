            We have the most photographed infant on earth, and we LOVE this camera.  We take pictures mostly in our house, but we take a lot of shots outdoors also.  The picture quality is outstanding and the camera is extremely easy to use.  It is very convenient--fits easily in a pocket.  It's also got a nice "weighty" feel without feeling heavy (as opposed to feeling too light and fragile or cheap).  The LCD is quite big and very bright even outside.  The battery life is more than adequate, and a spare is small and cheap (I got one on e-bay for 4.99).  Canon has also dramatically improved shutter lag from my S-40 model--I'm not blinking in half the pictures anymore!  The software that comes with this camera is great--easy to use for editing and storing, although I highly recommend Shutterfly for printing.  Upload speeds are average--about 4 minutes to upload 100 4 megapixel pictures.  

This camera gets some negative feedback on lack of manual controls, but it has all we need.  I used the aperture/shutter/etc. priority controls so rarely on my previous digital camera (Canon S-40) that I am relieved not to have them--the auto feature took the best shots 98% of the time anyway!  This camera does have a few manual controls you can use that will compensate for some troublesome lighting like tungsten or fluorescent lights, and that's been plenty for us.  It also does have a small dial that can be difficult to use, but for doing mainly indoor or outdoor family and activity photos, I never move it anyway, so I'm glad it's small and unobtrusive.  My only criticism is that the camera menus when first setting it up out of the package aren't very intuitive--tough to get all the settings (picture resolution, sounds, start-up image, etc., etc.) where you want them without the manual.  Once it's set up, you really don't need the menus often.  

Overall, we love this camera.  I have a very high-end Minolta 35mm SLR that I haven't had out since we got it!
