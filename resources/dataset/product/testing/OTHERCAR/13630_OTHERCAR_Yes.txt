            I bought my 1992 BMW 325i (e36) about a year ago.  The car had about 100,000 miles when I bought it.  I purchased the car for $9,000.  The car had been well maintained, but had a few problems that come with a 100,000 mile car.  The car had a blown oil pan gasket and a problem with the license plate lights. Since my purchase I have put almost 10,000 miles on the car and replaced the rear differential, the water pump, radiator, thermostat(twice), and have put new clips on the front passenger side window.  I have not yet fixed the oil pan gasket, because I cannot afford to pay the shop to do it.  Besides the leak is not that bad.  One big problem about owning a used BMW is that it is expensive to repair.   

But I have enjoyed driving the BMW.  It's five speed manual transmission shifts with ease and the suspension handles the curves wonderfully.  The 2.5 liter engine supplies adequate power and nice exhaust note comes from out of the exhaust pipe. I also like having the four door for the extra room for passengers.  It is hard to find a car that gives you so much(space and performance) as the BMW 3 series. The on board computer is quite helpful, especially in calculating gas pit stops.  The range button on the computer estimates the number of miles left with the fuel in your tank. The car looks nice with its red paint that has held up well for 10 years.  The Teutonic design of the car is shapely and beautiful.  My car has a gray leather interior that has held up well.  The front seats offer good firm support and are very comfortable for long trips.    

The car does have some drawbacks.  A drawback to the exterior is the black plastic bumpers and black side skirts that come on the '92.  I would rather have the body color matched ones that came on later models.  Gas mileage, although not awful, is not really good on this car.  I get about an average of 24 mpg.  On premium gas this can be quite expensive.  I think on later models the mpg gets better.  First gear is also too short and I find myself shifting into second soon after a start.    

Basically owning a used BMW can be expensive, but you get a driver's car that will thrill you daily.
