            I was a little reluctant as Dad and I drove to a local new & used car dealership one November evening.  I knew I needed a new car.  Dad was right about that.  My '88 Olds (a.k.a. The Beast) was getting too dangerous to drive.  "It's not going to last another winter," he told me.  But I didn't think that I could ever find a car that I could love as much.  There were too many memories attached to that Olds.  It got me through my high school years, and of course, you never forget your first love.  How would I ever manage to feel the same about another?

We test drove many cars that evening.  Nothing felt right.  Everything seemed all wrong, out of place... cold.  I was getting cranky.  I didn't care anymore.  I wanted to go home to my Olds.

Then the salesman said he had one more car in our price range.  It had just been brought in the day before and was in great condition.  Fine, whatever.  Give me the keys.

That's when it happened.

I sat down in the driver's seat and my mood instantly changed.  I told Dad to hurry and get in.  I put the key in the ignition and it started up without a hitch.  I knew right then that this was going to be it.

We test drove the blue '92 Buick Regal for a long time.  I didn't want to get out of it.  We stopped in a parking lot and looked it over.  85,000 miles on it.  No rust, dents, scrapes... shiny.  It looked brand new!  It was beautiful.

We looked under the hood.  How clean!  Whoever had this car before must have taken great care of it.  The tires were perfect, the interior was soft and well taken care of.  The brakes were as hard as a rock.  I really liked it.

Dad and I got back in the car and sat for a while.  "What do you think?" he asked me.

"Well, it's no Beast.  But I suppose it will do," I said while trying to hide my excitement.  I think Dad knew better.

We took it back to the dealership and bought it that night.  The salesman said that it may need a new battery, but they would put a new one in it for free.  Other than that, the tires and the brakes were new, and everything was perfect.  He was right too.

I won't lie and say that I fell in love with it right from the start.  It takes a while to let go of the past and warm up to a new friend.  And I did cry when it was time to give away the Olds.  But I knew that if I just gave it some time, the Buick would grow on me.

I've had my '92 Buick Regal for almost two years now and I've never really had a problem with it.  Not a squeak, not a grunt.  I had to replace the computer chip (I took it down south and the sudden change in temperature - cool to extreme heat - proved to be a little too much for the car's old computer chip that was used to northern temperatures) and the windshield wipers (which had been the same ones put on the car when it was brand new), but other than that, it's wonderful.  It's one of the smoothest cars I've ever been in - almost on par with Dad's '99 Grand Marquis.  It's been to Florida, Pennsylvania, and all over Ohio.  I now have new memories.  It's my new love.

By the way, about the dangerous Olds... Dad gave it to my brother-in-law.
