            The Olds Alero is a unique car in many ways. The way Olds markets this car makes it a very attractive purchase for many people. Unlike other cars where the upscale models include different body cladding or identification, the Alero simply has none. Unless you do your homework there are only a few ways to tell the difference between the GX, GL, and the GLS models. The easiest way to tell if it�s a GX (entry level model) is that the side view mirrors are always painted black (won�t help if the car is black) also the GX will not have Aluminum wheels, sunroof, spoiler and or fog lights. The easiest way to spot a GLS is the chrome finished aluminum wheels, it�s the only way you can get them. Which means all the other Alero�s are GL�s. With a GL you can load up a 4 cylinder model with either a 5 speed or automatic transmission, something you can�t do with most cars especially a Pontiac Grand AM. With the Grand AM GT it�s always a V6 with automatic along with all the body cladding. What�s also quite neat is that you can load up a GL so its more loaded than a GLS. You can order the Sport Suspension Package with either the 4 or V6 with the GL.

Most people buy cars based on their budget, but if money is not a problem there are some very unique option combinations that will make the Olds Alero quite the car. First off if you don�t like leather seats bypass the GLS model (standard). Go with the GL with the V6 (GL3) this gives you an automatic transmission (5 speed not available with the V6). Then add the following option packages; feature package and sport package. This gives you just about all the worthwhile options. Add the better Stereo and the Sunroof and you have Very well equipped car that will handle like a dream. If you choose the GLS you would still need to add the Performance Suspension Package, spoiler and sunroof. For either model this gives you the excellent handling with the Goodyear RSA Eagles, the sunroof is an excellent feature that you will truly enjoy, I think it�s the greatest way to air out or ventilate the car with the least amount of noise and blowing air through the car. The spoiler just makes the car look nicer. Other features that are included with the option packages or the GLS, like keyless entry, cruise control, power mirrors, adjustable drivers seat (full power on the GLS), the better Stereo, fog-lights, power windows with driver express down, better interior, the stronger suspension components, make this a small luxury car. You can also add the Gold Trim package and power Audio amp. Nice options but don�t add much. The Alero is clearly marketed in such a way that you will be able to put together the car that fits your needs. 

2001 CHANGES

For 2001 Olds has changed the option structure a little bit, first off the GL3 is history and the GX only has a delete option for the automatic transmission to get a 5 speed.The GL series is now GL1 and GL2. 

The GL1 is quite similar to the 2000 GL1, the difference is you have full choice over engines and transmissions. The GL2 also has the same choice but is fully loaded with sport suspension and spoiler, better wheels and tires. The GLS coupe includes the spoiler, optional on the sedan. Sport suspension is still an option on the GLS. A new cloth material on the GL, and new style aluminum wheels are also changes for 2001. Also a higher price.
