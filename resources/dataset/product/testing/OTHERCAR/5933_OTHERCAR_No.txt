            Right before my husband and I got married, we were in the market for a new car. Well, i should say a &quot;gently used&quot; car :)

We were young and not very experienced in the car-buying process. We thought it was simply go look, pick it out, get a loan, and everything will be hunky dory! :)

Well one afternoon we were out having lunch and there was a big car sale going on at the community college parking lot! We drove over to take a peek! A young girl came and offered to show us around. She asked what we wanted to spend.

Then she showed us the Mitsibushi Mirage. It was a 1994. It was *cute* and a little sporty looking. It had 2 doors! I LOVED the way it looked, but i had only driven older cars until then. We took it for a test drive.

After ONLY test driving that ONE car, we did the deal! We paid way too much and werent even thinking about the little particulars when we drove off the lot!

After we had the car for a while we started noticing the little oddities. It didnt have ANY cup holders! This bothered both of us a great deal. It also was SUPPOSED to have a locking gas tank, but ours never worked right. I had to use my keys and crank it open everytime i filled the car up with gas!

The GOOD part about this car was that it got us to vegas to get married :) 

I would recoomend this car to young people who dont have children! I would NOT recommend this car to anyone with small children. We had our first child a year after we bought this car and had to get rid of it because her little carseat wouldnt fit in the backseat!!<br><br>
