            I bought my Tracker brand new in 1990, which I believe was the second year they came out. Nearly 10 years and over 135,000 miles later, it's still going strong! The first weekend after I bought it, I took it four-wheeling over our rugged Colorado Rockies. The Tracker was like driving a toy tank! Even going through a small river didn't stop it! And in our Colorado snow, the Tracker just blazes right through, without ever getting stuck! 

Only in December of 1999 did our Tracker finally break down for the FIRST time! The clutch finally went out, and only cost $400 to repair. I'm always bragging to friends about this car's reliability. 

On the flip side, however, are a couple of items of concern to consider.
First, the Tracker seems to be pretty &quot;tinny&quot;, meaning that the steel doesn't seem all that strong. I'm not sure how it would hold up in a wreck, and this makes me a little nervous. I feel more comfortable driving our JEEP Cherokee for this reason. For more on our JEEP, see my review of our Cherokee, entitled &quot;In loving memory of Jeanette and Mick&quot;. 

Second, if you've got the car loaded with people, there's really no room left for any gear, groceries, whatever. There's a small area behind the back seat, but don't plan on bringing lots of stuff with you! 

Those are the two main drawbacks that I can think of with this car. Otherwise, I just love it, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable little SUV.<br><br>
