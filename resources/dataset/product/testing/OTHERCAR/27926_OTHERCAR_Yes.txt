            Without question, this is the finest car that has ever graced my garage. With acceleration that outpaced my previous BMW 540 ,this car is a rocket.Reliability is of course a Lexus trademark and this car does not dissapoint. Quailty is evident everywhere in both the interior and exterior. The navigation is superb and gets me where to the door step of my destination every time. THe automatically adjusting HID headlights are a pure joy and gets plenty of attention when the car is started and they adjust up and down. The brakes are incredible and is almost on par with my previous C4 Corvette. Leather appointments are of a high grade class. Only issues is that the body roll is a little more than my BMW 540 which had too many visits to the dealer service bay. I hold onto cars for around 3-4 years. I may keep this one for life. It is that good.
