            My 95 Blazer is the third one I have owned. Presently have 125,000 kms on it and would recommend to anyone. Just a couple of things tho - If you are buying it used  get the extended warranty! within 2 months of buying I had not one but TWO engines fail on me both covered by warranty with no problems since (2 years)  the Blazer is hard on gas but a nice ride.  With a good set of Snow Tires (not radials) the Blazer will go anywhere. Drivers side seat belt looses tension and will not retract easily, not covered by warranty.  Watch out for corrosion in transmission  My trans dipstick showed signs of corrosion and the dealer had to do a change out with a new dipstick.  Of course all the SUVs are overpriced  after all they are just pickups without the box<br><br>
