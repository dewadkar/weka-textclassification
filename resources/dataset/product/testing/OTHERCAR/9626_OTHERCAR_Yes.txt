                  Where to begin?...  Well, my tracker was my first car, and what a great first car it was.  Ever since I was little I'd always loved the way they looked, and when it came time for me to drive, my parents bought one for me.  We purchased it in 2001 with about 80,000 miles on it, and it still runs like it's brand new.  
      
      I've never have had ANY problems with it.  The only "mechanical" thing that tends to be unfixable is the "service engine soon" light on the dashboard.  We had it fixed once, but it popped right back on after about a week, even though there tends to be nothing wrong with the car.  After reading other reviews I found that this is a common problem.  
      
      As far as driving goes, the car's reliable and sturdy, but at times tends to feel a little flimsy and sometimes hard to control in strong winds. Also, when the top is on and your on the highway, it sounds like your inside a wind tunnel.  The noise this thing creates is terrible, but you get used to it. The turning radius is great; the car itself could turn on a dime if it needed to.  I have a manual and shifting is extremely easy, and although the clutch isn't loose, it's not tight either.  This gives plenty of room for play.  The car only goes to 90MPH and if you push it too far it'll let you know. Even with the top town, you have to remember that it's not a sports car ( I have to remind mysel too every once in a while).  The car is SUV based and drives like one. Mine is four-wheel drive and has come in handy many times, especially in the snow.  With four wheel drive engaged you can almost forget there's even snow on the road.  Manually locking and unlocking the front wheels tends to be annoying (some models have self locking tires), but it's not that bad. The only other thing I could think of as far as driving goes is that you better pray that you don't get into an accident involving a side collision (AKA: A car slamming into the side fo your car).  The doors are paper-thin and couldn't possibly hold up.       
     
     Mileage is great.  25  gallons all around.  The only bad thing is that it only holds 8 gallons, so you'll find yourself making frequent stops at the gas station.  
     
     The interior's nice, but just kind of average.  I have the base model, so no power windows or locks for me... :( tear.  Everything's layed out well, but nothing is very flashy or standsout, but that's not really a big deal.  The seats are kind of on the cheap side and don't really keep you in place around corners, but are fairly comfortable.  The backseat is way roomier than I ever expected and rivals that of some small sedans (no joke!).  You'd be surprised!  When I purchased mine the factory radio was gone and  replaced by a crappy tape player, so the first thing I did was invest in a new cd player.  The factory speakers are horrible and I recommend replacing those as soon as you get the car. 
     
      Now for the convertible part!  Having the top down in this car is the greatest thing in the world.  The only problem?... Well, even though it only takes about 5 minutes to take off, it takes longer to put it back on (I can do it in about 10 if I rush it).  There's so many snaps, buttons, and latches that it's almost not worth it.  But it is rewarding when it is off.   And if you don't wanna take it all off, you can always pull like a "sunroof" move and just unlatch the front and fold it back... if that makes sense.
     
      The car itself is in great condition, and tends to stay that way with minimal upkeep.  The only problem with the exterior is that the tow bar in back tends to rust, but this isn't a problem if, annually, you sandpaper it all off and spray paint it black again.  Oh yeah.. You can't take it through car wash! That's the worst aspect of a car.  If you want it clean, it's gotta happen the good old fashion way... by hand!
     
      Overall it's a great car.  Today it has about 120,000-ish miles on it and still runs great.  Even though I always tend to see older or middle aged people driving other trackers, it's definitely a great car for a teen, especially a new driver!
