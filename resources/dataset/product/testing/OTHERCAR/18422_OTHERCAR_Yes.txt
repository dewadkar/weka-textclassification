            I purchased a brand new 1997 Toyota Corolla a few years ago. It now has 39,000 miles on the speedometer. My Toyota came with the gold package, a sun roof, air, cd player, tape deck, power windows, power locks, security system, etc.....  

This car has been abused, tortured, left without oil change, no tune-up, no tire rotation, no bath and it just keeps going on and on and on. When I finally do get around to washing the poor thing the paint still looks like brand new (even without waxing). This is quite a chore for the poor thing as I live out in the country, back dirt roads.

This car just won't quit. It drives like a dream, smooth ride, easy steering, plenty of room for four people. I can't say it is the prettiest body shape or color (dark green). But I can say without a doubt that it is the best car I have ever owned in terms of reliability under extreme duress. I would recommend this car to families on a budget(the price is right and the upkeep is downright cheap). Add the reliability and this car is a real winner, just the automobile a young family needs. <br><br>
