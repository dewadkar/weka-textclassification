This digital camera stores 96 (320 x 240) images and uses 4 AA batteries (AC adaptor optional).  Although the resolution is not as high as some of the newer model cameras, the 96 page photo storage outweighs this drawback, in my opinion.  Dimensions: 66 x 130 x 40 mm thick.  Weight: 170 g / 6.0 oz excluding batteries.

Other key features: 3 terminals (Digital/PC, Video Out, DC in 6v); 1.8&quot; color monitor/view screen; Built-in slide show program; Multi-page viewing in playback mode; 3x zoom in playback mode; The lens swivels up to 180 degrees for angled photo shooting or self portraits; F2.8 or F8 aperture; 10 second self timer; Built-in 16Mbit flash memory (flash memory does not require power to keep data in storage); Easy software installation and operation on Windows and Macintosh systems; The camera comes with Adobe graphics software which makes it easy to manipulate and &quot;touch up&quot; the photos; Computer system requirements: 8MB RAM, 10MB on hard disk, RS-232C or RS-422 port, 3.5&quot; disk drive for installation.

My main reason for appreciating digital cameras is that they show life in real time!  You take the picture, boom, several seconds later you have the image.  If you don't like it, delete it on the spot.  It's difficult to edit unwanted shots with a video camera (the other real time imaging device).  When you have 96 photos you like you can download them to your computer, watch a slide show on TV or copy them straight to a VCR tape (great for family reunions and social gatherings).  A digital camera is a must for creating product photos to be used on corporate or personal web sites.  By taking 20 to 90 shots of a product and reviewing them &quot;instantly&quot; on a PC monitor, it is easy to choose which image will be most dramatic on your web site.  Analog photographs which are subsequently scanned into digital images seldom seem to come out as vibrant.

When I upgrade to a more expensive model, I would like to buy a camera that has a 3x zoom lens and also allows me to take 30-40 high resolution photos (1280 x 960) OR 100 (320 x 240) resolution photos.  320 x 240 photos are great for close-ups and nearby shots but get somewhat fuzzy when used for long distance shots.  For those shots I still use my Minolta Freedom Zoom 90EX &quot;analog&quot; camera or my JVC GR-AX25U video camera.
