            What a spectacular car!  An absolute dream to drive.  Ok, to begin I must admit that this is essentially the only car I have every owned, but I have test driven others and therefore deem myself as experienced...or something.  To walk the prospective buyer through the qualities of the car, here we go:

*Comfort.  Well, obviously if you are buying a luxury car you are going to be wanting this little facet.  The Bonneville, or as I adoringly call it, 'My Bonnie&quot; (ok, so I'm breaking the rule of only males naming their cars.  So I'm sick, so sue me) is one comfortable car.  The seats are spacious, which I find as a wonderful aspect.  If you are looking for an uncomfortable car, buy a Jeep Cheroke - simply horrible, I can barely fit my legs out the door, but anyhow...comfort is the top quality of this car.  I have never had any complaints.

*Size.  Leading off from comfort is the size.  To be so comfortable the car needs to be large - right?  I can't park to begin with.  Parking with this car is a near impossibility for me.  I account the size for my failing the driving test so many times.  Nonetheless, I am a rare duck so far as parking is concerned.  The average parker should be just fine.  Or not.  That's not important though.

*Cost.  I didn't buy it, my parents did so I can't complain or even speculate on this one.  I think it may be a little pricey though.

*Durability and safety.  My car is a '94 and already has almost 100,000 miles on it.  It still runs.  It has endured my fiendish driving at well over the speed limit - it's a quality car!  My parents gave it to me knowing this.  After failing my driving test numerous times, they hadn't wanted to take any chances.  After the wear and tear of the past few years I have found only a handful of problems, and those are primarily due to the fact that I'm careless.  The speakers are located right by where my feet swing out of the cars.  Yes, I have kicked them in accidentally.  One of the air conditioning vents has fallen off.  Yes it was an accident.  The divider shelf between the front seats had the top break off.  Yes another accident.  The air conditioning broke a few years ago but was repaired.  I can't take accountability.  The front license plate and a front light kinda fell off...but umm, no accountability there either.  Cement is too hard for it's own good when hit at a fast impact, what else can I say.  What I will complain about is that for some reason the auto lock and unlock won't work any longer.  I can't blame that on myself, but in consideration of the fact it is the only flaw the car has, I'll let it go.

*Gas.  It costs me well over twenty and on occasion when I'm paying attention - thirty dollars to fill up my boat of a car.  Then again I only do it once in awhile and the tank is well below empty.  I'd have to say on account of its size this car takes a fair amount of gas.  But I mean, really, let's talk about Connecticut's obscene taxes.

*Aesthetic appeal.  Needless to say - this is a very pretty car!  I'm not a guy and I'm not 'yay-cars' so this is really the pinnacle of what I can possibly say.  This is the best description I can give other than 'it's green.'  All in all - I recommend it.  <br><br>
