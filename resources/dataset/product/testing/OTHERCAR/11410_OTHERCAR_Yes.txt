                I am a mom with two kids. I had a Nissan Quest which was excellent. My lease was up and I knew I really have never had any problems with Toyota's in the past so I chose to look into a 4Runner. 
    When I arrived at the dealer my search was over. It is a spectacular looking SUV!
    I love the sporty look, the very large side mirrors which allows you to really see everything around you, the rear window that automatically goes down, and the wet mat that is in the back for those messy beach days. There is really so much that I can tell you about this SUV that I love. 
    It has great mileage, quick pick up, and the smoothest ride ever. When my husband drives it on the weekends he doesn't want to go back to his small car...LOL
     This SUV is for everyone. That includes families, single people, married with no kids, etc.. If you don't believe me just go visit your local Toyota dealer (and No I don't work for them). 
The value for this vehicle is excellent when comparing it to other SUVS. I did my homework on the internet. Good Luck!!<br><br>
