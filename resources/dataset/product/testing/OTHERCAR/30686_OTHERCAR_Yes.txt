            I bought this Jeep when in 1998 , I have had a few problems with the starter, which was replaced twice , one AC pump replaced under warranty. Other than that the Jeep has been trouble free , Perfect in the the tough winters here in Ohio, I have taken it on several long distance trips and have never been uncomfortable with the ride or handling.I have the model with the V-8 so it does suck the gas during city driving but it will  get about 18-20 on the freeway. I like the 10 way adjustable, heated leather seats , the radio  controls are on the steering wheel. I  would suggest the Jeep to  adult drivers , My daughter learned to drive on this car  and I think the V-8 is a little much for a kid to  handle <br><br>
