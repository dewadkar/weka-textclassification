            I got my Toyota Celica Convertible about two years ago used. It had just less than 100,000 miles on it. I know thats a lot... but I had just turned 16 and it was my first car so I didn't mind. It was light blue with a navy blue top. Very sporty and very fun! I live in Florida near the beach so it was GREAT during the summer! 

PROS : The car is adorable! People come up to me and ask all the time what year and model it is! The top is REALLY easy and fast to put down and up! This being my first car I have nothing to compair it to but to me it seems to get pretty good gas mileage! Also it has a back seat so my insurance company doesn't consider it a sports car so my insurance doesn't go up any!

CONS : Little by little it has started falling apart a bit... but it's over 10 years old so thats to be expectd! I've had to get a new alternator for it which everyone knows can be a bit pricy, and ever since I first got it I've had problems with the CD player not working right! I took it to the dearship to see how much it would cost to get fixed and it was about $200!!!... they also said that since it had the anti theft system (where if it was taken out the CD player would no longer work) I couldn't just put a new one in... it would have to be specially done which would also be very pricy.... The antenna also is stuck up all the time... this being partly my fault because when I noticed it was getting hung up on something I just went back there and pulled it up instead of getting someone to look at it! The break light remains on all the time and I need to have this looked at but I'm a poor college student at the moment so that's going to have to wait another week or so... The back seat is kinda small and since the top is over 10 years old the plastic back window has gotten a crack in it and is begining to leak water into the spare tire chamber... but my dad fixed this by drilling a hole back there so the water just leaks out! (good old dad!) Tops are also pretty expensive! Though it sounds like this car has been really expensive to fix.... overall I just fix what has to be done and wait until I have some extra cash to fix the rest... for now the broken CD player, antenna, and crack in the top window, I can live with!

Overall : It's been a great first car! It's been alot of fun and reliable. Though it can be pricy to maintain as it gets older.... all cars can be...
