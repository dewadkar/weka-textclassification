            I bought my first Honda -- a 1993 Accord LX Sedan 5 speed -- while I was in college.  At the time, I was looking for something reliable with good mileage.  Other things important to me were decent pickup (which this car had), and enough room since I'm a big guy -- 6'4&quot;.  This car fit the bill very well.  I bought it from a body shop that restored it after an accident, and the car was a dream.

I then graduated from college, and while I still loved my car, I decided it was time to go a little sportier.  I am getting married in August 2000, and decided that my car really was too much of a grocery-getter for someone my age with no kids.  Given my past experience with Hondas, I naturally gravitated towards getting another.  That and the fact that I had been lusting after the new Accord Coupe ever since I first saw one.  I was going to wait until after the wedding, but then came the special financing rate from Honda and the thoughts of, &quot;Gee, I really *can* afford this now.&quot;  The rest is history.

I researched the living daylights out of this, and didn't consider another vehicle for even a moment.  The competitors were either too expensive or just not up to par in my book.  I knew I wanted a 5 speed because I like to be actively involved in the driving experience.  This limited me to the 4 cylinder model.  I have a few words for Honda on this note: If you build it, they will come.  &quot;It&quot; in this case is a FRICKIN' 5 SPEED 6 CYLINDER!!  AARRGH!!  Why do they not get this?  Sorry, venting.  Anyhow, the 4 cylinder turns out to be fine for my purposes.  

What I like about this car.  
* The styling is great.  In my opinion, you just have to get the factory wing spoiler or it's just not the same car.  
* The options are pretty much maxed out because I got the EX.  There were a few things in this trim that were necessities -- alloy wheels, moonroof -- and others that weren't -- ABS, factory security system.  However, when I compared the prices of the LX and the EX, you just get so much for your money between the two.  There's no comparison.
* Good gas mileage.  I drive almost strictly city.  To give perspective, I drive 4 miles to work and it can take me up to 30 minutes at worst.  I still average 26-8 MPG.  
* Speed/handling.  Pickup off the line is good.  Leaves a little to be desired at highway speeds, but gets the job done.  The EX has different suspension than the other models, and it's apparent.  30 MPH right angle turns are nothing in this car.  :)
* Ergonomics.  Everything is big, bright, and logically placed.  Just what I'd expect from Honda.  (Aside: I have a friend with a Jetta that complained that the window switches weren't illuminated.  I asked him why he cared since he'd already successfully found it in the dark without looking.  Just try that in a VW, I dare you.)
* Little extras: huge glovebox, cargo net in the trunk, dual center console, dual trip odometers (LOVE this one), auto-off headlights, etc.
* I could go on and on...

What I'd change about this car if I could:
* Headroom.  Like I said, I'm 6'4&quot;, so I was totally asking for it when I bought a car with a moonroof.  I would've been better off in an LX on this note.  It's really not unbearable, though.
* Pickup.  Like I mentioned above, the acceleration leaves a little to be desired at highway speeds.  Mind you, it doesn't complain about being shifted into 3rd at 75 MPH.  Again, it's a 4 cylinder, so that's to be expected.  The VTEC does help out quite a bit, though.
* Little stuff.  I'm not crazy about the wheels (personal taste), the CD player doesn't show the track time (nitpick), the defroster turns on the AC automatically but doesn't turn it off (bigger nitpick).  Just stupid stuff that probably no one else cares about.

Overall, I love this car and plan on keeping it for a long time.  I like the style, it's reliable, economical, and will last me a long time.<br><br>
