            Dodge is an excellent brand of car.  In my opinion it is one of the only american made cars that can compete with the foreign market today.  while it does have it's drawbacks for being american for example I have to take mine to the shop more than I would have to if I had a Toyota.  The car definenltly serves its purpose, which is to be a good, reliable car for the most part, that is more than I can say for any other American car I can think of, and I have no regrets whatsoever about the purchase of this vehicle.  I would recomend it to any carbuyer looking for a good car at a reasonable price.<br><br>
