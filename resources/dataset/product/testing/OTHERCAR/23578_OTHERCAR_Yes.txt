            The ultra-stable, luxury rush of the Lexus IS 300 became available to the public on June 23 of Y2K, with a sticker begininning at a mere $31,000. While a car over $30k is pricey, after my test-drive on the track at Englishtown NJ I became absolutely certain that it's not possible to get more car than this for the price. 

This latest offering from Lexus is enough to turn the head of even the most dedicated Germanophiliac motorists. I didn't expect to be impressed as much as I was when comparing the <b>Lexus IS 300</b> to its more expensive German counterparts (see my report on the 2000 BMW 328 for more info). I was instantly converted into a Lexophile. 

Advantages of the <b>Lexus IS 300</b> become apparent at first glance of the interior styling -- more pleasing to the eye and sacrodiliac than similarly priced offerings from other automobile makers. The seats are comfortable and comforting. The leather manages to be both plush and rugged without appearing to be coldly designed by an unromantic  industrialist.


It is my understanding that most of the Lexan advances in manufacture &amp; design have been contained to &quot;under-the-hood&quot; engineering in this model, but this vehicle takes a great step forward for Lexus in terms of cosmetics and visual appeal.

An &quot;under-the-hood&quot; assessment is equally appealing to the prospective IS-300 owner. The standard powerplant is the Lexus 3-liter, twin-cam, 24 valve in-line 6-cylinder which pumps an impressive 215hp at an easy 5,800 revs per minute without spazzing the tach. The IS engine features VVT-i technology which promises &quot;continuously Variable Valve Timing with intelligence.&quot; While that makes me think that repair of this car's computer enhanced brain would tend to be expensive if ever needed, it provides a silky smooth rush along the straightaway without feeling as if you're damaging the vehicle by pushing it too hard or too quickly.

0-60mph acceleration is smoothly provided at just a hair over 7 seconds. Plenty of torque available here, with a nice incline on the impersonal diagrams that don't communicate the effective thrust of an in-person, real-life Lexus cruise. The top speed on this model is a testosterone-building 143 mph -- enough speed to quench the thirst for thrust in even the most macho cases of penis-envy and steroid-induced cojone-poisoning.

&quot;Fleet footed&quot; comes to mind when describing the handling of the IS 300. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 15.2lb per horsey; with most of this weight seeming to be distributed just over the axles. It seems to have <b>an extremely low center of gravity. </b> Wow! I got carried away and tried to lose my rubber-footing on the passenger side wheels around a couple of hairpin turns. The rubber was firmly glued to the most ungrippabe ground!

Plenty of side to side g-force almost threatened to make my lunch crawl sideways up the inside of my esophagus and stream horizontally out of my maw to splatter onto on the passenger and/or driver windows. I was a bit
rattled, but I couldn't rattle the car. It was incredibly stable.Virtually glued to the road!

One notable exception to the otherwise exceptional performance on the raceway concourse was the sand pit, which may have been too much for
this rear wheeler to handle at the excessive full-throttle acceleration I threw at it. A reasonable driver on the street has no business pulling such shennanigans with a rear wheeling thruster like this one over sand slides. 

I don't know what Lexus is doing to make the brakes feel so confidence-inspiring, and stoppable. Perhaps it has something to do with the &quot;four-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD).&quot; I'm not really much of a techie, so I don't know. But I couldn't get the brakes to vibrate with the usual ABS shudder. The vibration that ABS usually creates seems to have been dampened beyond recognition, with 40-0mph stopping completed at what must have been under two car lengths. And it was cushy.

The suspension was also cushy, but with enough driver-machine connectivity to communicate a sense of the road. One of the most pleasing blends of the typical &quot;German feel&quot; and &quot;American feel&quot; antithetical suspension philosophies I've ever encountered. You could hit a formidable pothole without spilling your Starbucks, and remember the topographic nature of the infernal pit from the sensory information communicaed through the machine-user interface. 

I hate to sound like a big shill for the IS 300, but it really is a covetable consumer sedan that appears stately enough to avoid the eye of the State Troopers while providing true sporty joy-rides when they're not looking. The stability is key. The engine, breaking, interior and suspension are also Grade A choice gear. The biggest criticism I could find after tooling around the track is that excessive driving techniques in the IS 300 may be addicting. I can see it now... &quot;Yes, officer, I was slaloming through dense traffic at 120mph, but I'm driving a Lexus IS 300! It's okay! I'm safe!&quot;
