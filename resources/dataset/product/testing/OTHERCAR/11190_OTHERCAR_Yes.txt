            I shopped for a long time when deciding which digital cam to buy. However, I didnt really have any experience with digital cams, so I didnt have a lot to compare it to. Im really happy with my purchase for the most part. I spent $250 for the cam. It seemed like a great price considering it was 3.1 megapixel. I could have saved 50 bucks and bought a 1.3 megapixel, but why? This camera takes great pictures! I love the macro setting, its very clear and accurate. Great for close up's of flower petals or tiny toes. Also, the software is really great. Very easy to use. Although to camera only has a 2x digital zoom, you can also zoom in with the software and adjust your frame. <b>The very best feature of the camera is the ability to view a slideshow of your pictures on your TV!!</b>  This was fantastic when I wanted to show vacation pics, or review pics I had just taken. I have actually set up the cam for a slideshow, played a music CD as a soundtrack and recorded the show onto a VHS tape. A great souvenir for friends!!  
Cons for this cam is that it doesnt come with a power adapter and you cant buy one. The batteries are rechargeble and you HAVE to buy the docking station to charge them up. Also, they wont charge completely unless you dock the cam until the light is green, then take the cam off for a few seconds..replace it on the dock and repeat the process at least three times. I found this out the hard way, and finally found the secret on the kodak website. I paid $79 for the dock. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I hope this review was helpful.
