            Last August, I entered the market to replace my 1998 Mercedes E320.  It had become 36 months old, which for me is very old.  When I bought the Benz, I glanced at the LS 400.  It was nice, but the interior didn't do anything for me.  It seemed big and a little dated.  It was missing some features which I didn't want to lose.  Since the E-Class had not changed for 2000, I checked out the S-Class.  The S-Class was beautiful, but I thought was too pricey.  I didn't think I should have to pay extra for HID and heated seats.  

I checked out Lexus again and heard about the upcoming 2001 model.  I decided it was worth waiting for.  It was.  Lexus held the line on the base price and introduced a $14,000 ultra luxury selection.  After I got over the price and name of this package, I realized this is actually a good deal.  It includes wide screen DVD navigation, laser cruise control, power door closers, power rear shades, Mark Levison sound, power and heated rear seats with massage, parking assistance, heated and cooled front seats, air suspension, moon roof, gorgeous leather and rare woods.  When you add the &quot;UL&quot; package to the base, you end up with a level of luxury and sophistication that exceeds any Mercedes S-Class.

Let's backup and look at the base car.  The V8 is voted as one the 10 best engines in the world by Wards Review.  Whereas the S500 has a gas guzzler tax, The LS is rated 2 MPG higher and does it with only 12 less HP than the bigger S500's engine.  While the S-Class give more road feel and road noise, the LS just moves silently and effortlessly.

Yes, the back seat luxury is a bit excessive and yes, you don't really need power door closers.  But this is a luxury car.  You and your passengers will remember these niceties.  Yes, Lexus copied the S-Class styling and didn't do too well, but MB copied from Lexus, too.  The S-Class finally gets a backlit instrumentation and they understand softer rides, low cabin noise, good audio, and navigation systems are important.  They stole that from Lexus.

I've driven this car for over month.  Every trip is enjoyable.  It is hard to make any jerky moves because acceleration and braking are both so fluid.  When you accelerate, you find yourself going much faster so quickly and so quietly that you wonder what happened.  There is no roar or wine from the drivetrain.  You just find yourself going 20 MPH faster.

The computerized climate system really does how to keep the passengers comfortable.  For example, when driving to work this morning, the sun was on me, but not on my passenger.  The car decided to wave a light breeze at my head, but not on my passenger.  I said &quot;wave&quot; because the center vents independently occilate.

Last weekend, I needed the address of a local police station.  I pushed the Lexus Link Service button for the first time.  A minute later, the radio muted and I heard &quot;Good evening, Mr. ____, what can I do for you.&quot;  After giving me the address, they begged to be of more assistance.  I then realized that at anytime, the navigation system will guide me to the nearest police, hospital or Toyota/Lexus dealer by just pressing 3 buttons.

The laser cruise is another one the subtle features.  I'll turn on cruise going 65 and find that 15 minutes later, I never needed to touch the brake or gas.  The car smoothly slows and accelarates as needed.

Even the parking assistance is well thought out.  It only helps in tight situations.  The Mercedes assistance goes on alert whenever the speed drops below 5 MPH.

If you're looking for luxury and luxury to you means quiet grace, technological superiority, safety and value, get the new Lexus.<br><br>
