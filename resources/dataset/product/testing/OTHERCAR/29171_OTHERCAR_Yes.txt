            My wife and I recently attended the St. Louis Auto Show and sat in most every SUV and wagon on display. We traded in our 1998 Ford Explorer XLT two weeks after the show when we fell in love with the Subaru Outback 2.5l 4 cylinder.
What a car! Although there is less than 100 miles on the odometer, we feel like this car is going to serve us well over the next 4-5 years. Let me give you my detailed perspective. I have done a lot of research on new cars and not once did I consider the Subaru on paper. Its all in the drive and the experience of sitting inside one.
The dealership we bought from is the only exclusive Subaru dealership in Missouri (Lou Fusz). This became an important criteria for us since the service area is equipped and supplied with Subaru specific hand tools and factory diagnostic equipment and factory trained mechanics. 
The car itself is an outstanding blend of interior refinement, smooth ride, and hauling capability. We test drove the L.L. Bean model with the 6 cylinder rated at 212 HP and the car we bought with 4 cylinders rated at 165 HP. I could not tell the difference in power on the test drive between the 6 vs. the 4 cylinder. The ride quality was the same and the only difference in options was the leather seats and 6 disc changer along with the difference in engines. We have had a six disc changer and leather seat option before with the Ford - nice to have but not critical for us.
GAS MILEAGE is rated at 28 hwy and 21 city for our Subaru. This was important to us because of my wifes 35 mile commute in heavy traffic everyday. We are not environmentalist but I am sure our more earth friendly neighbors will smile at our choice. The interior room (includes cargo area) in my opinion is HUGE with almost 96 cubic feet and it amazes me Subaru sculpted out this much interior space in such a tidy package. I am a larger guy at 6' and 240 lbs. The back seat was comfortable and non restraining. The front seats are heated and have lumbar support for the driver along with a 6 way power adjustment which are all standard features. With the heated seats, you almost don't need the main heater above medium low. The ease of putting on the seat belt was easy for me as well. I didn't have to search for the latch on my left because it sits up above the hip line for easy access. 
The instrument cluster is very "euro-classy" with easy to read speedometer and tachometer that appear black with green digits. In the daytime, the texture of the paint on the guages looks very soft and appear heavy matte (nearly felt) like in appearance. It also has the outside temperature and time right on the bottom of the tachometer making it easy to glance at. The in dash CD player and AM/FM radio sounds great without the tweeter package (I may upgrade the speakers later with Rockford Fosgate speakers and RF punch amp with sub since I am an audiophile.) The radio even has a weather band setting that lets you tune into the current weather! Very cool. 
Our options package (popular group 6) includes the auto dimming rear view mirror with digital compass, rear lift gate bar, air filtration and dust deflector (rear spoiler on top of hatch). For some reason, I think the rear lift gate bar is rugged and handsome. It just feels right when you use it to open the rear gate. Although the rear lift gate window doesn't open independently from the hatch, this is not a big deal to me or my wife.
The rear cargo area also came with a custom molded liner that will keep spilled milk and other liquids from reaching the carpet in the event of spillage from the grocery store. The pull over cargo cover also has a precise and quality built feel to it. It is easy to pull and lock in place. It also covers everything without huge gaps between the windows and rear seat backs. Nifty.
The interior lights dim slowly when the door is closed - a nice touch and the daytime headlights come on when you release the emergency brake and engage the transmission. The fog lamps are HUGE and light up a generous swath just in front of the lower hoodline making for excellent visibility. They are protected with rock guards giving them a rugged rally style look.
I like to change replaceable parts myself such as spark plugs, spark plug  wires, air filters as necessary and I am steadfast in changing my own oil and filter in my cars. Thus, a peek under the hood was in order to locate the oil fill, dip stick, washer fluid reservoir, and the oil filter. I located each of these as they are clearly marked in bright orange and yellow. The oil filter is WAY back on the bottom close the the firewall. It looks easy to reach if I put the car up on ramps I already use for such purpose. I didn't look for the oil drain plug because it was too dark in my garage. What I did see however was a large skid plate that covers most of the bottom of the engine and front suspension. Nice protection from road debris, but I fear the plug may be located behind this.
But who cares about where the oil drain plug is because with this car we are getting two full years of free oil changes and regularly scheduled maintenance. We were able to get this because of the coupon we picked up at the Subaru booth at the St. Louis Auto Show! With the LL Bean model we test drove, 3 years free oil change and service is standard. The LL Bean model also has OnStar with one year free service.
The best thing about this car and what really sold us on it is the terrific ride quality and handling. We test drove this car on a 6 mile course that was part city, part interstate allowing us to mash the gas and get a feel for the acceleration and the most competent braking at stop signs. This car is absolutely ROCK SOLID and composed on the road. The steering weight is perfect and turn-in response is predictable. As you increase your speed the steering heft increases adding to the quality of the drive. The turning diameter is a tight 37 feet lock to lock and this makes the car feel like it is on caster wheels which is a benefit when parking it compared to the Ford Explorer. Our test drive was unique with regard to the fact it was snowing and sleeting when we drove it. The All Wheel Drive system was confidence inspiring and we never felt like the roads were icy or slick. The all season 16' Bridgestone Potenzas probably amplified this feeling of stability. I can't wait to drive it to church tomorrow morning if my wife lets me.
Other features that are noteworthy but less exciting include the special window security etching my dealer put on all of the windows. The number etched into the glass is almost unnoticable and impossible to remove without taking out the windows which would have to be replaced. This number is trackable via a computer database and is supposed to deter theft and reduce your insurance premiums. The catch is, you have the option to buy the ability to transfer the number and track your car via Subaru which runs $200. I had rather write down the VIN# that is imprinted on all major body pieces and engine block.
The key fob is also well designed and smaller than typical key fobs. It is programmable so you can turn on/off the electronic chirp the car makes when you lock/unlock it. 
The windshield wipers and rear view side mirrors are all heated by the the push of a button and this should help if you have to park outside at the mall in bad weather. 
Finally, the Subaru brand is what we LEAST had in mind when we initially set out looking at cars to replace the Ford Explorer. We loved the Ford and its huge cargo room but not the vibration after  100,000 miles, just OK fuel economy, the myriad expensive 4X4 problems (pure junk), the expensive unscheduled maintenance (try a new heater out for $500 in 17 degree weather), the topsy-turvy handling, the broken 6 disc changer that no one wanted to fix for less than $120 (it remains broken), the bad timing chain guide that made the engine sound clickity-clack until it was replaced under recall, the engine manifold seals that went out at 60,000 miles, the radios lights that went out (fixed for $90), and the crappy padding within the leather steering cover that became lumpy and loose. 
So we looked at the Outback, noticed it was comfortable, fell in love with it on the test drive, and liked the extra standard features such as heated seats. The price was right for us too at $22,100. The sticker was $24,934. No haggling, up front honest pricing. We even did extensive research on the internet looking for the lowest price in St. Louis and these guys at Lou Fusz beat them all without us showing them the pay dirt we dug up on their competitors prices!!!
It will pay you to consider a Subaru if you want something roomy, fun to drive, with good gas mileage and a little less SUV like. It will make you repeat the old TV ad, "Ah - Subaru."
