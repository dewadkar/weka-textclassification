            Sexy enough for a woman, cool enough for a man.  This little 4 cylinder beauty is a moderate sports car at an affordable price.  All kinds of little fun things on the inside: great shape of the wheel, excellent layout of the control panel for the radio/heater/air, nice leg room (esp. for a compact), and a GLOVE BOX BIG ENOUGH FOR A 6-PACK (Note: I do not recommend storing alcoholic beverages).  Could be a little cramped in the back seat...  but...  that just makes it &quot;cozier&quot;... And for mileage, I'm getting &gt;30 per!<br><br>
