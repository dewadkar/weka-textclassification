            It had been a few months since my 16th birthday and my father and I started out on our mission. He wanted me to get a safe and cheap car and I wanted something a little bit more sporty then a grandma car. After a weekend of searching we found a 2-door Hawaiian Plum 1996 Chevy Cavelier. I liked it for its sportyness and he liked it for it price which two years ago was $7888. I've had the car ever since. The car has been to Key West twice, Orlando a number of times, and all around my home in Tampa. I've put quite a few miles on it, but it hasn't given me any trouble. The only work I've needed done on it was regular maintenence and brakes. Safety is another wonderful aspect of this car. I've bumped in to a couple cars, a tree or two and a fence; but there wasnt ever any damage to the vehicle, the bumpers are exellent. I dont think I couldv'e gotten a better car for my first, it's been a wonderful experience. And I would defenenlty recomend this car to anyone.
