            I'd done a lot of research when looking for a camera to buy.  I have expensive 35mm equipment, and it's bulky and heavy and, altho I love it, you need to WORK with it.  For this camera, I wanted something very simple.  Just toss it in a bag and take pix when you see them.  I didn't want to spend a lot, either.  After I read the reviews here at epinion, I decided that the camera for me was the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC640.  I got mine at the WalMart store for $150, regular price.

It is absolutely perfect for me.  Yes, it goes thru batteries fast.  You can control that by reducing the use of the video display.  Who can DO that??  That's part of the fun!  I carry extra batteries and look at the video all I want.  Subjects of the pix love the video, too.  

The camera is solidly built with thoughtful design.  It's nicelooking and pleasantly hefty.  The controls are very intuitive.  The day I got it, while I was reading the manual, a coworker took it without instruction and took pix all over the office.  There's nothing to it.  It is not autofocus (All my research and I didn't NOTICE this!!  Go figure.), but it has three settings for distance.  The settings are not too fussy.  If you've got the wrong one, chances are your picture will still look good.  If not, take it again.  If I had to voice one complaint, it's that I have trouble finding the 'shutter' button.  It's sort of on a corner of the camera, and not where I expect it.  After I've taken a couple of pix, tho, I have no more trouble.  I also wish they had put a little 'saddlebag' on the case to hold an extra set of batteries.  

I haven't printed any pictures out.  On the computer they're great, better, really, than I expected.  The camera can't be used with the USB hub, and my computer setup made it difficult to use any other way, so I got a Scandisk ImageMate card reader to upload the pix via USB.  Works great.  Best Buy, $30.  

This is the most fun camera I've ever owned.  I'm totally satisfied, even enthusiastic, with my purchase.  It's not high tech, not cutting edge.  Just good, solid quality, easy to use, fun to own.  I'd recommend it to anyone not wanting to spend a lot of money.
