            I have purchased an XG300 'L' model in last April. (I have traded in <i>'96 Toyota Camry</i>, which was also a fine car.) I have spent a few month to research for the replacement, including <i>Toyota Camry, Acura TL, Ford Crown Vic, Mazda MVP</i>...etc, for a roomy and safe family car. I have ran several spread-sheets with different "$" factors in various periods of time. 

As a result, this XG was fitting my needs
(1) <b>Roomy Cabin</b> - next to bulky Crown Vic.
(2) <b>Quiet Ride</b> - next to Lexus or Avalon. <i>Seriously.</i>
(3) <b>Acceptable Performance</b>, for me. 
(4) <b>Safety Features</b> - ABS, traction control, side airbags, and solid feelings too. 
(5) <b>Maneuverability</b> 
(6) longer <b>Warranty</b> and
(7) reasonable <b>PRICE.</b> 

As you may have seen from other reviews, the car itself is good. Really good. Its surprisingly quiet ride, roominess of cabin, and safety feature offers are beating most others. Its performance also good enough to serve as a family car. No question about it. 
I drove it 5,000 miles, and no mechanical problems yet.

<b>Let's Talk About the PRICE.</b> 
The hardest factor was "PRICE".
(I haven't made a firm conclusion yet, because I need 5 years to verify my calculations.)
Since this one is new in market, and Hyundai has a track record of bad resale value, I was very careful about selecting this car for the next 5 years. Here is what I did;

I assumed, 
(1) I will keep this car at least 5 years
(2) purchase, rather than lease

Then I compared with compatible car, say Acura TL. For the comparison, I used $21,500 for XG300 and $28,000 for Acura TL.
diff. in vehicle price = $6,500 (of course Hyundai was cheaper)
diff. in 'total' price = $7,150 (including sales tax...)
diff in monthly payment = $ 144 (8%, 60mo, $7,000 down..)
diff. in total monthly payment = $8,698 (diff. of 60 month payment)
...................
Then I work numbers backward. After 5 years, if I am very lucky, the 5 years old Acura TL may hold 50% of its initial value, $1,4000. To equalize its depreciation, this XG should value at least 25% of its value, $5,400, for same depreciation and financing cost for 5 years. I envisions that <b>IF</b> TL worth 50% of its value after 5 years, the XG sure will get at least 25% of its value, $5,400. 

If TL worth 35% of its original value at that time, realistically, XG will owe $1,100 of worth to equate same ownership cost. I am sure XG will have more than $1,100 at that time.

The XG will also have reminder of powertrain warranty at that time, too. This means I have nothing to loose. 

Then I went to the Hyundai dealership.

*** Please note that I have disregarded '<i>factor</i>' such as 'pride of ownership', 'repair headache', etc. I regarded those as subjective matter. I do not much care about brand names, and this one has more room and more features....while some people may think  differently. ***

<b>after 5,000 mile test drive</b> 
The car still drives good. Or even better. I like it all, except followings. 

I had hard time figure out all those convenient features. For example, the the drive's seat automatically moves backward/forward few inches for easy in-and-out. But parking brake have to be engaged prior to turn-off engine. Otherwise it doesn't move. Those kind of things were not fully explained in the manual.

The automatic climate control is a minus. When AUTO mode is set, the fan is blowing hard, real hard, to cool/heat to the 'target' temperature. When I manually lower the fan speed, the AUTO mode got off, too. (Not enough explanation in the manual.) One thing I noticed was, the FRESH/RECIRCULATE button has automatic sensor control, which works great. 

Wind Noise.: A noticeable wind noise at above 75-80 MPH. I am not sure which part of the car makes the noise. Engine and road noise is minimal, however, I can notice the wind noise at high speed. 


<b>How about the warranty..</b> 
I was not so 'excited' about Hyundai's warranty. I rather hoping this one would not claim its warranty at all. It would be very inconvenient to go to the Hyundai dealership from my home or work. But it is a giving me a good 'back-up' for the long run.
In my past experience, thing goes wrong when warranty expires, somewhere around 40-50k miles. I believe Hyundai carries 5 year/60K mile bumper to bumper and 10 year/ 100K mile powertrain. If there is someting wrong with the car itself, it will show up within that period.

So far, so good.
