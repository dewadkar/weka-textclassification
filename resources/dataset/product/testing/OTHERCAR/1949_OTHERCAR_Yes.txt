            Hello everyone! I am the proud owner of a 2000 Nissan Maxima. It is mother of pearl white with tan cloth interior, power windows, cd player and best of all a sunroof! I bought this car when it was 2 years old and it was one of the best investments I have ever made. Safety comes first in this car as it has duel airbags and a few other features that make me feel comfortable to have this car on the road. It isn't that bad on gas mileage, I know that is a concern to many. Nowadays, even with gas prices being so high, I can full the tank for anywhere between 15 and 18 bucks. I find it amazing, and so do others that I allow to drive it, that you can be going 60 or 70 miles per hour on the road and you literally do not feel the car moving. It is the smoothest car I have ever been in. I must confess that I was doing 80-90 a few times and didn't realize how fast I was going, I guess that isn't too good of a thing but when I realized that, I immediately slowed down. Never had a speeding ticket and don't plan on getting one although when you drive this car, you just want to go fast. haha! I haven't had any mechanical problems with this car at all so far. I just get the standard oil change every 3000 miles or so and basic maintence. This car does not have a timing belt in it so I don't ever have to worry about that going. They usually go around 60,000 miles or so. Well, this is the 3rd car I owned so far and I plan o driving this one down to the ground. Not interested in buying another car for a while and you can be sure that when and if I do, I would definately buy another Maxima or another Nissan car. The Altima is another great choice as well. It is a little more affordable the the Maxima but has many of the same features. My sister's boyfriend has a 2002 and that is a pleasure to own as well. The body style is awesome! I hope you enjoyed my review and hope you consider a Nissan.
