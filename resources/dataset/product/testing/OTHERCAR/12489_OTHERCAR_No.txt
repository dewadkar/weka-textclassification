                 The Beretta was introduced around 1988, and was intended to be the "sporty" version of the crude Corsica sedan. Both cars were discontinued in 1996, but I don't think they'll be missed.
 
     Chevrolet somehow felt that the Beretta never needed a redesign, that was a mistake on their part. Minor freshening took place in the 90's, but that didn't cover up the aging car's short-comings. Anyone who's ever owned a Beretta or driven one will more than likely relate to some of this review.

     The Beretta in 1995, its final year mostly, fell way behind competitors at the time. The first thing one will find unappealing about this car is it's long, extremely heavy doors. They become an extreme pain if you're running errands all day. Some people like the exterior styling of the Beretta, but to them I ask, "What styling?" The Beretta retains its aged design from 1988, and few cosmetic changes were made; A driver's airbag, front end face lift, and minor interior modifications. Unless purchasing the Z26 trim line, the base Beretta lacks sporty styling as well.
     
The interior of the Beretta looks and feels cheap. Plastic seems to be the car's best friend, and it all feels unsubstantial and cheap. The short stocky automatic gear shifter feels and looks awkward. The front seats are uncomfortable, and give you a terrible driving position. The front seats are too low, and makes it difficult to see over the hood of the car, though I'm a tall driver and didn't have to much of a problem, I did find that the windshield wipers were cumbersome. I don't know if it was just that car in particular, but the wipers don't rest all the way back down after "wiping", making seeing out even more difficult in rainy conditions.
     
Controls are some of the worst I ever seen, and are extremely confusing to use. Steering feels too vague, and the car itself leans sharply when cornering. You can only feel guilty for sticking someone in the cramped rear seat, though it's not the worst I've seen. The climate-control system is weak as well. You're better off just keeping on your jacket in the winter, and rolling down the windows in the summer.
     
This car doesn't hold it's value well, reliability is spotty, and can end up costing an arm & a leg to replace parts.
