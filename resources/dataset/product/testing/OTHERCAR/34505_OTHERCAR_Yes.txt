            Nestled in amongst the Dodge Neons and Mitsubishi earwigs on a rental lot was a Sunfire.  Knowing that Neons give me shin splints, and the average economy Mitsubishi can't get out of the way of a bicycle, I grudgingly opted for the 'Pawnticket'.
Being one who sits in a rental and familiarizes myself with everything including the owner's manual before starting, I was pleasantly surprised to find ample room for my ample frame, and all the essentials within easy reach. But the real surprise, and, I might add, fun is to be had after hitting the road. 
Having been weaned on a rally-ready Spitfire, I expect to be nervous about being able to get out of harm's way in a rental, especially in downtown Houston.  Not so this little gem.  It's not a pocket rocket, but lively is understated.  This model had the smaller stock engine, and still sat right up and took prisoners. Very quick, very responsive to the wheel, maybe a slight penchant for understeer, but getting used to that was easy.  I went  four hundred miles in three days in the greater metropolitan area and enjoyed almost all of the time spent in this comfortable little piece.  I also drove through a blinding Texas downpour on the highway and, after the initial white knuckle tension, found the Sunfire equally well manifested as a docile and safe foul weather car. I got an overall 32+ miles to the gallon on a 575 mile total trip.
As for drawbacks, the gearshift is annoyingly present while trying to convert the ashtray to its cup dispenser incarnation, or tune the radio. The rear window doesn't shed rain at all for visibility's sake, and some of the plastic joints and pieces won't last a teenager's summer trip to Oswego.
All in all, this is the first time I'd ever say I'd gladly buy a Pontiac.
A very fun car, and well worth a surreptitious look;  no one will ever know you didn't buy an econobox, but a great fun toy. <br><br>
