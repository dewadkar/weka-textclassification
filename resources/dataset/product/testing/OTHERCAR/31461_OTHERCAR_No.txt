            I received this camera as a gift from my boss instead of a turkey during the holidays.  I have used it for 2 years now and ready to "get real" digital camera.  For a low end giveaway camera this might suffice.  But the picture quality is just OK, not great.  I do much better using my 35MM SLR and scanning in the photos to my scanner/PC.  I use a compact flash card since on board memory is limited and if you are not near your PC to download you have no more room on board.

I found the USB download was fast enough, but agree it could be faster.  So I purchased a compact flash card reader, hooked it up to my PC, and use the HP software to download the photos through USB from the card - much faster, like 63 photos in under a minute!  Microtech makes numerous USB card readers.

I'm now in the market to get a new digital camera, looking for better quality photos, higher megapixel, and non-digital zoom.  Digital zoom on this camera really makes photos grainy.

Before I forget, another plus and a minus.  First, the minus.  I dropped the HP for a short distance onto a carpeted floor.  The battery door has 2 small plastic catches on it and when the camera hit they snapped off.  Could not get the battery door to stay closed - apparently HP knows something about this because when I inquired what to do they just shipped me a replacement camera, under warranty, and sent me a return kit for the broken camera, no questions asked.  That's the plus - they are excellent in service and warranty resolution.  That's HP for you and why I have their printers in my house.  The camera/print software is somewhat limited, but sufficient for this limited type of camera capability.
