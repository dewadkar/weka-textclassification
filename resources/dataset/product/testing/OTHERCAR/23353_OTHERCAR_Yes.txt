This is my first epinion ever on epinions.com. I know it doesn't look like, or is much, but it is my first epinion, and I won't ever edit it.</b>

      Ever since I was a little kid, my parents, and grandparents have always bought mercedes benz vehicles. I love this vehicle because like all mercedes it drives like your gliding through the air. The interior matches the interior of any other car. The outside of the car is as classy as can be.
      I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for any kind of small type SUV. If you are not looking for a small SUV, then this vehicle is definitely not for you. If you have forty thousand dollars to spend, and you want a good, quality car, definitely look into this one. I would not recommend this to someone who is not sure if they want to buy the car, because it is to much money to just go out and spend if you are not sure if you want the car.
      In Conclusion, for some people this car can be the best car in the world. Others make not like it as well. Give it a test drive, then make your decision.
