            The Nissan Maxima is simply the best value for midsize cars under $30,000 today, and it beats out quite a few much more expensive ones as well.  For as low as $22,000 it has more power (222 bhp) than some luxury cars, and is widely available with a stickshift, rare on Camrys and Accords today.  It comes with a long list of standard features, and the knowledge that it will stay on the road trouble-free for a long time.  It also has lots of sporting appeal, especially for someone who needs to haul stuff (or kids) around.  There is plenty of storage space as well, with a trunk that will swallow several golf bags and a rear seat pass through for skis.  The Maxima appeals to anyone looking for a solidly built car that has a lot of nice touches at a price that doesn't hurt to much.  <br><br>
