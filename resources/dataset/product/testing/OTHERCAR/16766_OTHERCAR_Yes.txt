I was given this camera as a gift.  My feelings on the camera are mixed for the reasons stated after each point:

Pictures - While the quality of the pictures can not be beat for clarity, detail and color, I find them to be too large.  I have tried the resize picture feature and find it really does not help much.  The downside for me with this is, for example, that I do auctions on-line and one auction site I list with rejects the pictures as too large.  Therefore, I must resize them in a different program and then upload them.  Also when working on a slower speed computer (which I do) and laptops, the transfer time to send pictures through email is much to slow.  One picture should never take a few minutes but with the size it does.

Ease of use:  I give the Camedia top grades here as it is very easy to learn how to use and the features are also easy to navigate.  The <b>one</b> feature I do not like, which is up to the individual, is that you can not erase all the pictures at once.  You must go through each picture one at a time.  I find this to be, simply put a pain as it is time consuming.  While I realize this prevents accidental deletion of an entire set of pictures, I do prefer an "erase all" feature.

Battery Life:  I use my camera quite often and the batteries lasted approx. 3 months.  I just had to replace them.  The Camedia Batteries are NOT rechargeable as stated.  If you look on the side of the battery it states plainly in red lettering: do not recharge.  Overall, I do not think 3 months is a bad life span but this particular battery cost me $17.99 and the camera takes two which runs in to some money.

Storage Capacity:  The camera only stores 16 pics on a removable Smart Media Card which is not a lot but I have an extra one.  The good thing about this feature is you just pop out the card and put in another one if you know you are going to be taking a lot of pictures.

Port:  The connection for the Camedia is UBS so if you have an older computer this camera is not for you as there is no serial or parallel port connection.  Luckily, I do have a UBS connector.

I can not rate the video features of the camera as I do not have any use for them and would not have bought a camera based on that feature being a mandatory option.  I suppose it can be a lot of fun and useful also.

On a whole this is a wonderful camera as the detail and the pictures are A-ONE which helps when I photo small items for auction.  However, for my use I would have bought something with not so many extra features.
