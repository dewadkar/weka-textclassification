            I bought my Paseo about two years ago and just sold it.  Why did I sell it?  I'll tell you that a little later on.  Why did I buy it in the first place?  Let's get down to it.  If you read my profile you'll see that I thoroughly research just about everything before I buy it...especially cars.  Here's the advantages I found to be true after owning the car for two years:

- Toyota is known for quality engines that will run well above the 200,000 mile mark with very few problems.
- The Paseo was one of the best-looking cars made back in 1992 (purely my opinion). The teenage girl that bought it from me fell in love with it as she was walking toward it to take it for a test drive!
- If you're looking for a fun, small car that can carry an occasional third or fourth passenger, the Paseo may be for you.
- Great gas mileage (due to the small engine of 1.5 L and great aerodynamics).
- I only had one major mechanical problem.  The passenger-side rear strut mount became loose. (That just caused an obnoxious knocking noise.)  From what the mechanic told me, this is a very rare occurrence.  Cost about $250 to fix.

Now for the disadvantages:

- The rear seat is quite uncomfortable if your passengers are taller than 5 feet.
- The roof is a little on the low side. That may be common to most sports-like cars. I'm 5'11&quot; and that left about two inches of clearance. (Fortunately, I don't have big hair.)
- No airbags.
- The manual shifting is a little on the rough side.

The main reason I sold it was because of size and safety concerns. It's definitely a small car.  Driving next to some of these SUV monsters, I sometimes would imagine what would happen to me if I encountered one in a collision. Not good.  But nevertheless, it's a fun car to zip around in.<br><br>
