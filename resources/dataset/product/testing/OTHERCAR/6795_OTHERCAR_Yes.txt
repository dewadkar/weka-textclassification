            My daughter bought one at an auction.  I cursed the &quot;damn&quot; thing because of earlier reports from friends who bought earlier models.  I went through the car to get it to the point of the safety check required for registration.  After it passed, I then drove the car for a week and fell in love with it.  This car was a sleeper.  It had more going for it than anyone was letting on, it had toys that were optional extras on domestic cars (or non-existant), and very smooth pick up and go that Chev with a comparable engine did not have.  Sold the Chev and bought an identical one for myself (except I have auto trans - she has a 5sp manual).  I will definitely go for a new one when the time comes.  You can get more car for the dollar than with any comparable domestic and it seems to beat out the Japanese for value.  It may take some time yet to beat out the bad rep the Hyundai line received from the early models, but isn't that what the Japanese had to contend with as well?<br><br>
