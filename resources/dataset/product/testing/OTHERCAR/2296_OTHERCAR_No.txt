            I bought this vehicle because it was cheap and my husband has the sportage.  I cannot tell you how many recalls there have been on this car.  When my husband first experienced problems with his car, I thought it was a fluke and decided to get one anyway. Big mistake.  Now as of late, they send me a letter telling me there is something wrong with the fuel pump and it could cause fatalities!  My God, could they have screwed up any more?  If you are deciding to get a Kia, think again!  This has taught me to do more research on a potential new car.  You should ask people who drive the, always get more than one opinion!  It's very important it could be the difference between a fender bender and your life!
