            I run a small training and consulting firm. I am always looking for ways to differentiate my self from the thousands of other firms in the U.S..

With this technology I have been able to capture activities, events and exercises before during and after class. The photos from the SONY MVC FD91 are being used on clients Intranets and I have used them for my training documentation. Everyone that has tried this camera loves it. I personally have sold three of theses cameras just by letting people play with mine. The one-minute M-PEG movie feature is great to send to people over the net and the software that comes with the camera is fantastic. I have been able to create effects that look like Olan-Mills quality photos and they have printed from my Photo Printer.  

The only negative I feel this camera has is the size. It is comparable to a traditional camera and the lens is fixed. 

The zoom and white balance features really add to quality of the pictures. 

I am currently using this camera and the software to create a book for my daughter.  I took shots of her doing the daily things and edited them with the software and printed them on photo paper and they are bound. She can now read a story about her day and see herself.  She Loves It.  

This was a great buy. Thanks SONY. <br><br>
