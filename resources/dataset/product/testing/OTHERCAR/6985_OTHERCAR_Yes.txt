            I have this truck for a college vehicle, and have found it to be a very good machine.  I have put over 30,000 miles on it since I got it, it had 124,000 miles on it.  Only thing I have replaced is the starter motor and a couple of miscellaneous items, along with the usual maintenance items.  This vehicle will haul lots of junk, perfect for a college student.  It also pulls a trailer fairly well, I pulled a trailer with it for 6000 miles this summer.  I have also equipped it with a roof rack which allows me to put the spare tire on top, opening up lots of space in the back. 

Off road, this vehicle also does very well.  Its short wheelbase and well balanced weight give it good traction and stability.

Only things I don't like about it is the ugly green color that the dash lights up at night, and few squeaks and rattles its got.  Oh well, its a truck.

If you're looking for a 2-dr style chevy SUV, these work well if you're on a budget.  If you've got a little more money to spend, pick up one from 1996 on up, they've got more power and better gas mileage.  The TBI engine in the 88-95 trucks/suvs last forever, but they don't have a whole lot of power and gas mileage.
