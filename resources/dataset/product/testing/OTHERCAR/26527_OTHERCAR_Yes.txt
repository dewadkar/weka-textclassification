            I use to own a 1996 Ford Probe GT.  I loved this car to death and was planning on finishing to pay for it.  I then moved into an apartment and was forced to purchase a vehicle that I could better afford which led me into my local Chevy dealer.  I had been looking for an s-10 because I really liked the looks of the front end and the 4x4 package until I spotted my baby.

Looks
The looks on the 2000 Extreme is exactly what it says.....extreme.  I has ground effects on the front and underneath the doors.  These make the truck look like its almost floating on air as it drives.  My model has the flair side rear wheel wells.  They also offer a fleet side (flat) The rims are a 5 spoke and are brushed aluminium.

Interior
The inside has the same feel no matter what chevy car you are in.  From a corvette to a blazer.  Nice wrap around feel with charcoal colored steering wheel and dash.  The seats are charcoal cloth and are completely adjustable.  Overall a very comfortable space....even for taller people.

Ride
The extreme ride like a truck.....just like it is supposed to.  You will feel most of the bumps and rocks, but the interior and looks more than make up for the ride.

Overall this truck is my baby and the only thing I would trade it for would be a Benz or something crazy like that. This truck is very affordable to lease or buy and is well worth the money. If you want a sweet looking ride and don't mind the bumps.....this is it.  <br><br>
