            I began to do some significant research into digital camera a few weeks ago.  I began to solicite the opinions from a lot of my friends on which camera would be the best, and overwhelmingly the response was for the Olympus D-340R Digital Camera.

So I began to research more information on this camera and on the next generation of it - the D-360L.

I cant say enough good things about this product.  On the medium setting - which allows for 36 pictures on the 8 meg SmartCard - both on screen and printed I had a high quality picture.  In fact, just printed out of the software from the camera - without ANY doctoring of the image in Photoshop - I was able to get a high quality image straight out of my printer.

I would spring for the floppy disk adapter when buying this camera, however.  The serial adapter that comes with it does not allow for very fast transfers of images.  Using the adapter is a breeze.

As of right now, I am on my first set of AA batteries for this camera.  As I am not a huge fan of rechargable batteries, I don't see me using anything OTHER than AA batteries with this camera.  

I have found this camera very easy to operate.   <br><br>
