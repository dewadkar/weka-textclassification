            My best friend recently bought a 2000 Rav4.  This car is loaded with automatic transmission, rear defroster, power windows, doors and pretty much has all the bells and whistles.  The stock speakers and system aren't bad either.  The car, for the most part, rides pretty smoothly.  And it is nice to sit so high above the rest of the cars on the road.  But, there are a few drawbacks.  There is virtually no pick-up in this SUV at all.  Gas mileage isn't too hot either.  But overall, this car is pretty neat to drive.  It drives pretty much like a car, not a SUV.  I feel comfortable enough to drive it though I am used to cars.  I recommend this car for people who aren't looking for alot of pickup when driving.  IT makes a great around the town kind of car.  I wouldn't recommend it if you like to take long road trips, because the seats are too comfortable.<br><br>
