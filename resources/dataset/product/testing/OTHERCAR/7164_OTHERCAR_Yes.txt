            We purchased our 1999 Dodge Caravan after the birth of our third child. After looking at many of the mini vans that are on the market it was our favorite for many reasons.
The first reason is that we already owned a Dodge truck and have had NO problems with it at all. We have found them to be well made vehicles.
The biggest selling point on the Dodge Caravan were the second sliding door on the driver's side which makes getting the kids in and out of the van extremely easy.  This also allows the children to exit the van away from traffic at all times. 
Honestly when we first got the Caravan I was concern about being able to drive it since it was much larger than the car I had owned. I was so pleased to find that it handled much like the car had and I often forget I am driving a van. It handles very well.
We opted to have a luggage rack installed since the Caravan has a smaller cargo area in the back that the larger Grand Caravan. Though smaller the cargo area in the Caravan does have hooks for grocery bags so that all the contents don't go spilling all over the place as you drive home from the store. 
The Caravan has tons of storage space though out and more cup holders that you will ever need. We just love the storage drawer under that passenger seat that locks. The perfect place to store your valuables when you want to leave them in the vehicle.
For added space the center seat can be removed very easily and the rear seat folds down or can also be removed. I could not believe how easy it is to move these seats!
Shortly after purchasing this van we took a 1,000 mile trip we have taken many times before in our previous car and we had always hated the long drive. In the Caravan it was wonderful! Everyone had plenty of room, and our two older children took turns riding in the far back seat so they could lay down. And on top of the comfort of this mini van we got much better mileage than we had ever expected, a real plus with today's gasoline prices!
The only problem I have had personally with this vehicle is that there is a small blind spot between the driver's window and the back seat window, but this is something I have been able to adjust to quite easily.
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone, with or without children. After riding in our Caravan several of our friends have also purchased Dodge Caravans and are just as pleased as we are.<br><br>
