            The Xterra is incomparably better than my old GMC Jimmy, but there are still some major flaws.  It drives well, it is the most functional SUV I've seen, and it is relatively inexpensive.  The shifting is beautifully smooth for a truck and the 2 foot long shifter feels manly.  Your friends might taunt you for being so &quot;Xtreme.&quot;  

The interior bike rack is amazing, it fits two bikes firmly enough to go offroading without having the bikes bang around.  The vinyl cover for the cargo bed is well designed and the rubber floor mats keep everything clean in the mud.

The Yakima ski rack is an unmitigated piece of garbage, however.  It broke the first time I used it (the lock jammed) and then immediately after they replaced it, the lock exploded into component pieces.

The stock stereo is clear and powerful, and the controls are functional.  For passengers, the raised &quot;stadium&quot; seating in the rear gives them better vision, comfort, and ability to converse with people in the front seats.

The gas mileage is horrible at 15 mpg, even on the highway.  This is particularly inexcusable because the engine is much weaker than my old Jimmy.  The bad gear ratio may be part of the problem, as it goes over 3000rpm around 60mph (Outbacks go 10-15 mph faster at same rpm).  Shifting into 4x4 is also poor, as the manual shifter is not smooth and &quot;on the fly&quot; isn't more than 20 mph (i''ve tried).

Plus, it is only inexpensive until they try to charge you $400 for the ski rack, $400 for the interior bike rack, and ~$500 for the exterior weather sealant.
  
All things considered, it is better than any other SUV on the market, so I give it 5 stars for beating the competition.
