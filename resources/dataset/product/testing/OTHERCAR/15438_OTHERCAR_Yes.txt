            At Thanksgiving 1999 I borrowed a camera from a friend at work.  It was an earlier model with less options.  My wife saw how much fun I was having with it and how easy it was to take the pictures and load them on our computer and she ended up getting me the Sony model MVC-FD88 for Christmas. 

 Since then I've taken hundreds of pictures and quite a few movie shorts of the grandchildren.  It's so cool to be able to share these with my family via the internet.  There are so many free resources available and the simplicity of the camera and the software make it very satisfying.  I never have to say I don't have any film, I just grab an old 3x5 floppy, slap it into the camera, select the file option on the menu, format the disk and I'm ready to go.  

Depending on the resolution I can get 24 standard shots or 1 giant BMP, I can take four 15 second movie clips.  There are actually a number of options and most of them are simply a button or click away.  The manual is very informative and useful.  

I took the camera on vacation to Italy in March and it was so cool to be able to instantly switch over to &quot;play&quot;, see the result and switch back to take more shots.  We also took a lot of pictures on a west coast driving trip this summer, it is truly a joy.  

The only drawback I can see is that it is big and bulky as compared to the standard cameras most people use or the throw-away types.  But for the size there is an awful lot of power packed into it and I recommend it to anyone who is at all technically oriented and enjoys working with computers and utilizing the internet.
