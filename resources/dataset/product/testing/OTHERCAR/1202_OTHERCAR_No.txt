            Well, the deal with purchasing a used Saab is primarily that you need to check the car out bumper to bumper, the vehicle may look fairly well on the exterior, and possibly in the interior, but the real deal with purchasing a great Saab is the history of the car as well as what's under the hood. I believe it is a must to find out the history of the car, find out what has been fixed and even how many times it has been repaired. You can find a lot of great used Saab's, but every once in awhile you will come across a great looking Saab that will become a pain in the near future, as i did. After the first month of owning my '84 Saab hatchback I discovered myself stranded twenty miles from my house with a broken clutch. It was then I discovered I also needed a c.v. joint, a , new wheels ( which are expensive ), new brake pads, and a new headlight. It seemed like every week my car had broken down. To say the least i didn't get to drive my car too much the first year i owned it, due to the weekly repairs it needed. So my advice to any Saab soon-to-be owner is this.....you may need deep pockets and patience if you are about to own a used Saab. But every once in a while you will come across a very dependable and reliable Saab. Which really makes it worth it.<br><br>
