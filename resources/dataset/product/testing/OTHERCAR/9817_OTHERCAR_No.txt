            The camero is traditionally a muscle car.  It has always been one of the top contenders in the quest for the best American made sports car.  All you have to do is look in any performance magazine and you will see page after page of bolt on horsepower for these fine machines.  However, you must first find the money to buy one!  Whatever happened to the concept of the affordable sports car?  With the base model you get something that my grandmother could outrun on foot!  To get something that will actually move or that someone makes performance components for you have to get into the 20,000-dollar price range.  Who needs it?<br><br>
