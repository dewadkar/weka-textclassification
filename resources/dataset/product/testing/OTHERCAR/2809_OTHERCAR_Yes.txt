            I love this camera! It is easy to use and I am no wiz kid on the techno end of things. I bought it 2 years ago and paid high end for it but considering the amount of stuff I have sold on ebay due to fotos, it is a winner and neccesity. Easy to learn to use and even though I have not mastered all the gizmos, you can start right away with point and shoot and improve from there. 
What are pluses and negatives. Well I read one other epinion that said it is not for professionals. I am not a foto pro, but on the other hand I did
take some self fotos for my promo business flyer, used the high compression mode and my PRO printer was able to take the zip disc foto and use it and it came out as good if not better than taking a real pro foto and paying studio costs etc. That way you can shoot and reshoot until your heart is content. Like all computer gizmos I bought this and wondered what I would use it for. I originally planned to use it for ebay fotos only but now I have used it for business, family fotos etc. I took my kids soccer shots with zoom. Put the foto on their birthday party invites. My point is as with all these toys the uses are endless once you get one and play with it a while.
Negatives, I had a HP scanner and once I added the camera there was a software conflict and the camera bumped the scanner off. Weeks of online techsupport hell with Dell/Olympus/HP got me NOWHERE! I had a friend who is network administrator come over and put the scanner back on. Once I reloaded the camera, BANG off went the scanner. I am sure someone could fix this but doesn't this kind of stuff drive you crazy. They never tell you about this before you buy it. Also the digital media is super easy to use. Pull the media out and put it in a floppy and insert into your floppy drive. Negative is batteries go out every 3 to 4 months with heavy use on media card as well as the camera needs batteries frequently if you use the lens open and close alot like I do.
Overall very happy with this camera. I had read about it in PC magazine and they were right on with it being a good camera for the money.<br><br>
