            <b>Prologue:</b>  (mood music optional)
<i>It was a dark and stormy night.  Our heroine, who would like to be called Anastasia (even though her name is Deb) drove pensively through the Oregon countryside, focused only on the black winding ribbon of country road snaking though the countryside, while rain poured unceasingly from the even blacker clouds overhead.  Suddenly, a shape (animal? vegetable? mineral?) materialized in the unlit road directly ahead.  She braked wildly . . . too late!!  The mule, who was even blacker than the storm clouds overhead and who was standing in the north-bound lane, looked increasingly alarmed as he was scooped not-so-gently on the hood of her car and taken for a ride he had imagined only in his worst nightmares.  (Do mules dream?  Never mind.)  He slid gracefully and effortlessly over the hood and through the windshield to end up in the passenger seat beside our heroine.  She, who rarely picked up hitchhikers, was not pleased to find him there.  Leaving skid marks on the highway that were even blacker than the mule and the clouds overhead, she stopped her car that had so recently been perfect in every way.  The mule, knowing that he was an unwelcome visitor, struggled out of the car and continued meandering down the highway, never to be seen again. . .</i>

<b>Act One:</b>
After my insurance company had inspected the damage, the car was declared a total loss and I received a check for the car's full value.  I was in the middle of final exams at the time and handed the check to my father with instructions to select &quot;something that I won't have to worry about if I hit another mule&quot;.  I didn't stop to consider all the implications of that statement.  If I had, I might have been more specific in my instructions.

<b>Act Two:</b>
Two days later, my father called to inform me that I was now the proud owner of a nifty 5-speed, imported . . . Nissan pick up truck.  My son was thrilled.  My dad was happy that his daughter wouldn't call him to haul furniture anymore.  I was mildly dismayed.  I'd never considered myself to be the truck driving type (I had no tattoos that I was aware of) and had hoped for something that would make me look somewhat exotic and desirable.  However, I love my father (good thing) and trust his judgement.  After looking it over, I decided I was safe from most critters larger than a possum and smaller than a dinosaur in <b>The Truck</b>.

<b>Act Three:</b>
During the next three years, I developed a love-hate relationship with <b>The Truck</b>.  I loved being able to haul large objects.  I hated hauling more than one large teenager (anyone larger than mini-Me).  I loved the Nissan durability (no mechanical problems after 160,000 miles).  I hated not having a back seat for our dog in the summer (no AC).  Winter was a different story.  While I yearned for bucket seats, I had to admit that having a warm puppy curled up beside me had some benefits.

<b>Act Four:</b>
My son recently turned 16.  I helped him to buy a car last summer and he has offered to let me drive the car and he would take on <b>The Truck</b>.  Surprising even myself, I turned him down.  He'll borrow it occasionally, but <b>The Truck</b> has become one of those dependable friends . . . faithful and true, always there, demanding no more than a full tank of gas and an occasional quart of oil.  Who could ask for more?  Sure, I'll probably trade it in someday (as a human, I'm entitled to be fickle) but for right now, here, today, I'm happy to be driving my pick up.  And, I still don't have a tattoo.<br><br>
