            So far, my experiences with digital cameras are surprisingly
pleasing. It is a great feature to be able to view the picture, and
decide whether or not you want to keep it, or discard of it.

On my recent trip to Paris, I got to give my digital camera it's
first use. No wasted pictures - no &quot;accidental&quot; shots of my hands
getting in the way of the lens or the picture going off when I
drop the camera... Nope, just 50 solid pictures (16MB memory
card). 

And the resolution - I was pleasantly surprised to see that the
picture quality was great... Much better than I expected! 

You have several flash options (no flash, flash, and automatic),
and red eye reduction which is extremely efficient and helpful. 

Once I got home, I was anxious to import the pictures from my
camera to my computer - i was once again, pleasantly surprised
as to the simplicity of the task. I had my pictures imported within
a half an hour. 

You can send your pictures to friends around the world through
the internet - just attach the file or paste it right onto the email,
whichever suits your fancy. 

Personally, I used my Adobe PhotoEditor Deluxe Version 3.0 to
crop my photos and create photo slides and framework for my
picture. 

Whatever floats your boat, I guess!

The Kodak DC-200 is a great buy!
