            The first major decision that my wife and I faced after getting married was buying a new car.  We live in Colorado and wanted a dependable 4wd vehicle that was fun to drive.  We shopped all models of SUV's and narrowed our options to the Acura MDX, Toyota 4Runner, BMW X5 3.0 and the Nissan Pathfinder.  We decided on the Pathfinder and here's why.

The recent introduction of the 3.5L engine into the Pathfinder transformed this vehicle from a turtle into a hare.  I have previously driven older models of the Pathfinder that were owned by my friends and family members.  I enjoyed the styling and dependability of these models, however, the engine was never well suited for the vehicle.  It seemed drastically underpowered, which made it difficult to climb the mountain passes or even to merge into traffic.  That has all changed for 2001.  The 240 hp engine is a dream to drive.  I never have to worry about having enough power to pass slower traffic or merge onto a busy freeway.  

Now I know that people don't buy SUV's for the power, they buy them for the "utility."  Nissan provides plenty of utility in this model.  With the rear seats folded flat I was able to fit a twin mattress, box springs, headboard and a nightstand in the rear end of my Pathfinder with ease.  I find that off-road, this vehicle is quite capable of 95% of all situations encountered by the common recreationalist.  With 8.3 inches of ground clearance, the Pathfinder climbs over many fallen logs and small boulders with ease.  Even small water crossings prove to be quite elementary as well.  The towing capacity is adequate for the size of the vehicle.  If you are looking for a workhose to pull your 30 foot speedboat, this probably isn't the vehicle for you.  However, if your desire is to get your snowmobiles up to the high country for the weekend, this vehicle is perfect. 

The interior is equal to SUV's costing much more than the $29,500 that I paid for my Pathfinder.  I choose the LE trim package for my vehicle.  The leather is durable yet luxurious, and the heated seats are a must for colder climates.  The memory seat function is great when you are occasionally sharing the vehicle with another person.  The in dash 6 disc CD player with Bose speakers is a must.  No more pulling over to the side of the road so that you can access your CD changer in the rear of the vehicle.  Now all 6 CD's can be loaded in the dash.  The tilting and sliding sunroof provides a generous view of the passing clouds.  If you get lost, there is a handy compass/thermometer that is located just in front of the sunroof.  Those who ride in the back seat of the Pathfinder will appreciate the reclining seats.  These come in handy if you opt for the DVD player that is viewed on an LCD screen just behind the sunroof.

Every vehicle has its drawbacks and the Pathfinder is no exception.  Power comes at a premium.  Literally, the Pathfinder requires premium fuel for this ever thirsty engine.  I can expect to get around 15 mpg in town and just under 20 mpg on the highway.  My only other complaint is the footroom for the rear passengers.  Unless you have very slender toes, you will not be able to slide your feet under the front seats.  This is unfortunate because there is plenty of knee room in the rear seating area.
