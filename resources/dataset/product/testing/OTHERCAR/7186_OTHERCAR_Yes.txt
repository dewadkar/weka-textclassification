            I bought myself a 1996 Nissan Maxima about 5 months ago (July 99), the best deal of my life.  I didn't go into this deal blind either, I did my research on the web, go topinions from friends, and test drove the hell out of it.  I have had 0 problems with my car and I find that others love my car also.  
Mine is a 4 door, gold package, sunroof, rear spoiler, power everything, Bose soundsystem, CD, tape deck, 8 speaker system.  Its is a very nice ride.  I've driven it 7,000 mi already (been to Vegas and back), still not one problem.  Not only is this car reliable, it is also sporty.  Have no problems impressing people in my car.
