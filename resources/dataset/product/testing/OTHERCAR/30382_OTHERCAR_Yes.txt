            After driving a Ford Aerostar for nearly 12 years it was time to trade it in. In it's day it was considered innovative. I loved it's comfort and practicality. The last 3-4 years I had been looking for a replacement only to be disappointed in the cookie cutter styling of the vans and the ridiculous prices to match. I had the top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer model Aerostar and became spoiled by the top-of-the-line gadgets.

My son, the 10 year old walking encyclopedia on automobiles, directed me to the local GM dealer to critique a Chrysler Town and Country van when I spied the Aztek huddled amongst the Dodge Durangos, Suburbans and Jeep Cherokees.(We live in mountain ski resort and they're plentiful on and off the lot).

&quot;What is that!&quot; I asked &quot;it's and Aztek mom&quot;. He proceeded to rattle off the features with a tone of I'm wasting my time, she couldn't possibly like this car. But I did, I loved it. And when I saw the sticker price I loved it even more.

Finally a car I can get excited about.

We ventured into the lot too late to test drive. So the next day I took my husband to the lot to show him my great find. Needless to say he wasn't as excited as I was. He's a financial advisor and I'm a digital graphic/web designer. Needless to say I've embraced the arty/techno revolution in a way he struggles to understand sometimes. He suggested we drive a few other models before I jump into a car with no history. I appeased him by testing the Subaru and VW Bug. But my mind was already made up and he began to warm up to my new find and realized I was going to be difficult to live with if I didn't get my Aztek.

It took several days of surfing the net to get information, compare prices and features. I found epinions and read many of your comments. I enjoyed them very much and found some instrumental in closing the deal.

I did it. I became the first and only owner to date in our small town. I have had it for 2 weeks. Of coarse I was stopped by police twice in the same day for speeding. After 30 years of driving I get my first speeding ticket. I explained to the officer that it was my first day with my new car, it's so quiet I didn't even know I was going 72 mph in a 55 mph zone and that I was still getting use it. He wasn't impressed and gave me a ticket anyway. Since then I have used the cruise control religiously.

Not to ramble on any more...I'd rather be driving&quot; here is the laundry list of things I love and things I question.

1, It's incredibly quiet
2, Fabulous sound system
3, Plenty of leg room in both front and back seats
4, Love the fact that it gets 19-26 mpg. (I think it's irresponsible to get   anything less)
5, I think it looks really cool.
6, It's quicker than my Ford
7, Tight turning radius
8, Plenty of cargo area to haul framed art and skis
6, I could afford it...allot of car for the money

This is what I got.
   a, sunroof
   b, power seats and door locks
   c, cd player/equalizer...love the settings
   d, keyless entry
   e, traction control


I did not get the tray...I thought it took up too much space. I did not get the tent though I'm thinking about it for next summer. And I did not get the GT model. I thought the gadgets were cool but I didn't want to spend the money on them. 

I wasn't interested in 4WD. Though we have 5 months of snow I have never had 4WD before so I didn't want to wait for it. I plan on putting studded snow tires on however.

Many reputable magazines review the car along with the other SUV's. Some of those reviews fail to elaborate that the Aztek is 10-20+ thousand dollars cheaper.

I was looking for the practicality of my old van but wanted the feel of a sedan. I got it in my red Aztek.
