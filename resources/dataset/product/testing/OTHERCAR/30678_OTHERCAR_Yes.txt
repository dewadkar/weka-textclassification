            By looking at the '97 Grand Cherokee, it's hard to tell what year it is.  Jeep has stayed with this style for years and it's no wonder.  Now, it's not the most extravagant, or the burliest, but it does pack a punch.  It has style combined with grace and the inline 6 cylinder is enough for the off road and limited towing.  It's almost the perfect combination to appeal to the greater consumer.  

It's also American so you know it's not going to be over priced like many imports.  There are many options as well to make it comparable to other luxury SUVs, like the leather and heated mirrors option.  And the ride though not without bounce, is smooth enough so the rides are not annoying yet refined so it still feels like a 4x4.

Cargo space is plentiful, although the full size spare does take up some room in the back.  It has roof racks on top of the vehicle so not to take up space inside, which also makes it ideal for the outdoors kind of person.  It's also comfortable for those long trips to the mountains.

Many people look for a rugged SUV with a reasonable price and that's exactly what the Jeep Grand Cherokee is.  It combines utility with class.
