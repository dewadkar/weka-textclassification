            We have owned several GMC products for our business.  Over the years we have also had several luxury vehicles in the fleet.  We have to move very heavy samples, and also customers over quite some distance.  Doing business in the Northeast, we are very subject to slippery and snow covered roads.  The Suburban (now own 3 and have &quot;retired&quot; 2 others) has been the best of all worlds.  We can take customers in comfort, haul heavy loads, trailer things when necessary, and have the assurance of all wheel drive.

All our Suburbans have been equipped with 350 engines, 4 wheel drive, and overdrive transmissions.  We have loaded them to the hilt with every option available.  Though they drink a bit of gasoline, they are well worth it.  This vehicle does everything we could ask for.  Each compiles an average of 45,000 miles per year, and are retired to a slower life at approximately 150,000 miles.  At this point we usually  have had little expense for repairs. We do wish they would improve the windshield wipers though.  The new type are not nearly as good as the former ones.

Though very pricey, they do offer value, comfort, and dependability.  We love the roominess, but feel that the price and gas mileage are a bit much.  However, we would not do without these fine trucks.<br><br>
