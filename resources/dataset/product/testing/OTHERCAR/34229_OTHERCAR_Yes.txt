            The Toyota Solara, is a stylish alternative to the 4 door sedan. The one thing I keep hearing about Camry is that it has become the generic family vehicle, and somewhat mundane. This may or may not be true (it's all relative) but the fact remains, when you put your family in this car, you can expect to provide them with many safe miles of travel without being parked on the side of the road waiting for a tow truck. Having owned 2 Honda Accords and 2 Camry's...the Camry's have it hands down. First off...I found Hondas brakes wear much quicker. Having reviewed my service records recently, I found I get 9500 - 11,000 more miles, on the brakes with the Camry. Overall, though, service reliability is about par. The Solara comes in standard with anti-lock brakes.

The purchase of the Solara was actually going to be another "generic Camry" type, but once I saw the rear end of this Solara I was sold. It's a drop dead nice looking car, 200 horsepower 3 liter v 6,  with faux (but very nice) wood trim and leather seats, premium stereo cd player, electric mirrors, etched security safety glass, security (*meep meep*)system aluminum wheels, moonroof, monogrammed carpeting throughout including trunk.This thing is loaded. I was lucky at the time and found one that wasn't sold on the lot and moved on it. Toyota financing is wonderful and I got low interest financing through a special they were running. SCORE!

Driving this baby off the lot was great. It had nice handling. the salesman mentioned this car was originally slated to be I the Lexus line and they appointed it with double insulation under the hood and paid particular attention to fit and finish. Well, having been around salesmen, I let that one fly over my head. I did however hear it from another dealer since... so I can't be sure. The suspension is real forgiving of bumps in the road and the V6 is a necessity. The 4 cylinder is great for the flats, but if you live in hilly or mountainous regions, get the 6. I do a lot of skiing so the 6 was the obvious choice. Fuel consumption is economic at  around 24 mpg, on the average up to 27-28 on the turnpike. It has plenty of pep and has no trouble getting in and out of traffic. (neither did the 4 cylinder). Long trips of 300 miles or more at a sitting are non- fatiguing.

Interior space is not as ergonomic for a family of 4 as the 4 door, obviously, but for a 2 will suit you just fine. If you have to haul kids and load in a baby seat etc...get the 4 door. The rear windows do not go down, so safety is a concern here in a family scenario as well. All the controls and gauges are well placed and there are no complaints on that front. The tilt wheel is accommodating. 

The service schedule on this car is a reasonable one. I highly suggest getting this car serviced at the dealer. It is reasonable and chances are you will not be paying for any major work if you maintain a strictly disciplined service regimen. Besides, Toyota has been real easy to deal with for out of warranty items, like replacing an airbag that was squeaking, in it's housing. Other than that I have had to replace a headlamp, battery, brakes, and a broken windshield when somebody tried to steal it. insurance though is very reasonable for these cars.

For $21,000, I would be hard pressed to get the quality  have found with the Solara. I would do it all over again if I had to!
