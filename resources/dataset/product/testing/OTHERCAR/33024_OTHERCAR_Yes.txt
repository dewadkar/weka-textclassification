            Back in 1995 I moved back to Massachusetts and needed to trade my S-10, RWD, truck in for a FWD.  I had been looking around at a lot of FWD coupes but did not really like what I was seeing.  I pulled into the Dodge dealership on a Friday night just after closing and I saw an awsome red car in the back row that just immediately called my attention to it.  Now, I'm not partial to red but the car just spoke to me.  I had to have it.  I didn't immediately see any other Avengers on the lot but spotted a dark one sitting in the showroom.  First thing Saturday morning I was back and I got a closer look at a dark green Avenger that was in the showroom.  I took it out for a test drive and fell in love and I'm still happy driving it over 84,000 miles later.  I bought it.  Its a Highline model with the I-4, automatic transmission, power everything and an Infinity CD Player with 8 speakers and a built in amplifier.

For a 4 cyl auto this car has some power.  The transmission is quick to respond if more power is needed and if being floored the transmission won't shift gear until redline.  The car has sleek styling that still turns heads five years later.  This car holds the road well and is excellent at cornering.  The rear seat is very roomy for a sporty car but I wouldn't recommend it for long trips if the people in the rear seat are taller than 6'.  The front seats are spacious and the majority of controls are well laid out.  The stereo is probably the only thing that could use relocation since ejecting or inserting CD's can be a bit cumbersome with the gear shift sitting directly in front of it.

I have have very few problems with my Avenger.  The front rotors due tend to warp prematurely but there are ways to resolve it.  The best way is to hand tighten the wheels and not use an impact wrench.  Another alternative is to installed cross drilled rotors.

There are a few companies that are starting to realize that there is a market for aftermarket performance parts for the Avenger.  For information on who some of these companies are and what they offer or to see what other Avenger owners have done to improve an already great car check out the Avenger/Sebring Owners Group at http://www.asog.net/.<br><br>
