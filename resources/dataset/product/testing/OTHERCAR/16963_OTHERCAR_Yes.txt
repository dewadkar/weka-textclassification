            I bought my RAV/4 in the summer of 1997, so it is three years old now, and I just love it!

When I decided I was in the market for a new car, I had had a Toyota Tercel SR5 since 1985. The Tercel was a very reliable car, it got me everywhere, even up our steep icy hill in the Oregon winters. I was looking for something newer, but just as reliable, to take its place.

My husband had just used an internet service to buy a new pick-up, so he did some investigation on the available SUVs and we decided to go for the RAV/4.

As I said, I bought the car in the summer, so I had to wait for several months to test it on the ice and snow. It does just great. It goes into  4 wheel-drive automatically and extremely smoothly, I never even notice. The best thing is I can get around town and up the icy hills without a worry, even when everyone else tells me they were slipping on the roads.

The Rav appears small and fits into the tiniest parking spaces, but I feel like it is very roomy. I have good visibility while driving, the passengers are comfortable, and I can carry a lot of cargo in the back. I really like the fact that the back door swings open to the side, not up like hatchbacks. I can get chairs and tables into the back by myself since the opening is so large. It can be a problem in windy rainy weather since everything in the back gets wet with such a large opening.

The RAV is very popular, I see several on the road around town. I got the lavender color, and I even see 3 or 4  of the same color in our small town of about 6000 population.<br><br>
