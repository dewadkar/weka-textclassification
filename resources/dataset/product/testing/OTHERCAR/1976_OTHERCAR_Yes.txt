            I am currently driving a 1991 Nissan Maxima. I started driving it in December, 1998. My sister had previously owned it and when she got a new car I decided that I would take over the payments. I really love the power that this car has, and it never gives me any problems even though it has well over 150,000 miles. The car is very easy to drive. My parents own a 96 Toyota Camry and feels somewhat lose on the road compared to the good handling Maxima. I would recommend this for anyone. It is sporty enough for a younger person and roomy enough for a family. If you are looking for a good car this is the one for you.<br><br>
