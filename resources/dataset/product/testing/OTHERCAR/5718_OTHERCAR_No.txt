            I was stupid,didn't do enough research and relied on the salesman in the camera store for guidance (didn't know about epinion then). I have used it for about a year for family things as well as professional things.  I am a wound care nurse and often use pictures for documentation as well as educational presentations. I would like to sell it but feel guilty selling such a poor product to anyone.  The long delay between pressing the button and the actual picture has spoiled many a picture-college graduation, anniversary party etc.  The battery life is very short.  In the sunlight it is difficult to see the screen and see what you have in your photo. All in all I can truly say I am sorry I bought this camera.<br><br>
