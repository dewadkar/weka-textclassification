            I have been a Montero owner since about 1985 and have found these vehicles to be extremely reliable and dependable. I have owned several of them and would buy another. If there is a downside, it is the availability of parts when needed and the dealer network in the Southwest is a bit thin.
The Montero itself is a tough vehicle compared with its competition and serves well as an off road machine, which is the kind of use that I give it. It is well suited for farm and ranch use as well as for hunting. Generally speaking, it seems to outlast many other sport utilites in its class.Properly maintained, it is a strong performer,although a bit underpowered for its size and weight.
Overall, I would recommend that anyone in the market for a true sports utility vehicle put the Montero on their &quot;short list&quot; to investigate as a long term ownership car that will last a long time.As a used vehicle, it is usually underestimated when it is offered with somewhat hight mileage on the odometer...most comepetetive sport utes can be consideree pretty well worn at 100k miles...a well cared for Montero can be a very good value for the used car buyer who is willing to take the time to check one out, and they are usually available at attractive prices on the used market.<br><br>
