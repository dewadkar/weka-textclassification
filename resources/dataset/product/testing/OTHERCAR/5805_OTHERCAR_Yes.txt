            I will try to talk only on subjects not really covered in detail on other posts.

I wanted to go digital and find something to replace my Olympus Epic 35mm film camera (which is very small).  After a month of research, it came down to the D-490 or the S-10.  The deciding factor for me was that the S-10 required a costly proprietary battery.  It is nice to be able to use AA batteries, and in a crunch, most drug stores now carry AA lithium, although you can always use alkaline for 20-25 photos.  

I love the fact that anyone can pick this camera up and use it easily.  Unlike my old Mavica, which was bulky, this camera has no real learning curve.

The most important thing is that the camera takes excellent photos without having to make manual adjustments.  It is perfect for taking quick shots of the kids, or quick shots on vacations.  But it has the ability to be manually configured, to a degree, to help with unique or difficult lighting conditions.  8X10 photos on my epson 740 are fantastic.  4x6 prints from shutterfly look better than my 35mm prints I get from Eckards.

One of my main concerns was having enough storage for when I take vacations.  We usually go on 3 or 4 week vacations and take 200+ photos (low compared to most people).  You will have to purchase additional smartmedia card(s).  I bought 2 32meg cards for $30 each.  I took photos at the SHQ and HQ setting of the identical scenes and could not tell the difference in my shutterfly 4x6 prints.  Therefore, I keep the setting at HQ mode which gives me 64 photos per 32 meg card.  But in reality, I've been averaging 75 per 32 meg card.  With the 2 32 meg and the 1 8 meg card that comes with the camera, I can take about 168 photos.  While on vacation, I figure I can review the photos on a TV every few days and eliminate to bad ones.  Also, the HQ mode is much faster than the SHQ and when photographing small children in action, is the only acceptable choice.

I purchased 12 new Nimh Nexcell batteries and charger for $40.  This gives me plenty of power.  Keep the lithiums that come with the camera as emergency backups since they will store for 10 years.  K-Mart makes a perfect digital camera bag for only $10 that stores the camera, 2 extra Smartmedia cards, 4 batteries, and the video out cable nicely.

Purchase by the end of Jan 2001, and you can get a free USB reader from Olympus.  Check their web site for info and the order form. 

Now for the bad:

Contrary to what most people have said, to me the camera feels cheap.  I'm comparing it to a Mavica which can be used as a hammer.  The plastic housing seems thinner than most, and the battery, smartmedia, and connector doors are flimsy.  Be very careful when opening and closing them.  The battery door takes a good bit of force to close and you have to be sure it is slid out before pushing down, or it could break the hinge.  I don't get the feeling of durability.  

Even thou it is small, it won't fit in jean pockets like the epic would.  It requires a camera bag anyway.

Having to pop up the flash is an extra step that really could have been avoided if it were just integrated into the camera?  Why did they make it manual pop up?

Many people complain about closing the camera - having to push the cover a bit without hitting the lens, wait for the lens to retract, and then pushing it fully closed.  But it is something you get used to and is not terrible.

Overall, considering there is no perfect camera for under $700, this is the one to get for those of you who are used to P&S and are not professionals.

UPDATE
---------------------------------

OK, I've had the camera for a while now and shot over 1000 photos with it.  Nothing is broken and it seems more rugged than it feels.  My wife and I have forgotten to pop-up the manual flash a few times, but it is nice for 2 reasons:  1.  It helps reduce red-eye and 2., You are positive the flash will not fire.  On my old camera, you had to set the flash off and sometimes it was difficult to see the setting.  

I have not had any problems with the delay from the time you push the shutter release button to the time it takes the photos.  In HQ mode, it is fairly fast.

My biggest complaint is that when taking photos of a fast moving subject, (and my 3 year old is always moving), the photo will be blurry.  This is true with all digital cameras in this price range.  However, I just manually set the ISO to 400 and that usually solves the problem, albeit you get grainer photos due to increase light sensitivity just like with film.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a small P&S style camera.
