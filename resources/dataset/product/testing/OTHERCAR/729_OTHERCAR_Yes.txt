            I am the proud owner of a 97 Eclipse GS-T. T is for Turbo. This car kick ass. I have owned it for a year now and it's great. I give it oil every 3000 miles and have had no major problem. This car screams down the road. I have topped it out at 147 on I-5 along side a BMW Z8 (not recommended). The speedometer goes to 170 and my goals is to get it too 155-165 with it's current engine.

Enough about my dreams and aspirations. Here's the scoop. I purchased this car used with 17,000 miles on it. It currently has 33,000. I take it in for oil every 3,000 miles. With the Turbo I'm trying to baby it as much as I can. I have had no problems with it except for new tires and the alarm was acting funny for a couple days. The GST, GSX and GST Spyder boast a custom front/rear bumper with built in fog lights. 

The ride: The ride is great on the freeway, feels like you are floating. Surface streets you better look out for the potholes. Gets a little rough out there. 

Interior: I have black and tan interior. Dash well laid out, stereo is a double decker cass/cd player. Bucket seats are comfy and well supported. The back seat or lack there of, folds down 50/50. So when I take it boarding, I can get three board and three people. Just make your shorter friends sit in the back. I have power evrything along with the power moonroof. Cruise can be set to 120 mph with the car not giving you any lip. Moonroof is noisy at freeway speeds. But, the cars performance makes up for that. Abs is standard, haven't had to use it yet. Knock on wood. Only upgrades for mine is a modified Blow Off Valve and Intake more air more powerful combustion/less gas used. 

Good: Girls like it, Cops have let me go after checking it out, Can hang with any car with a bigger engine (Amazing what this little 2.1 liter 4 cylinder can do. Likes to eat Stangs and Camaros for breakfast.

Bad: Ride can be harsh on bumps, not forgiving like my old Civic. 
Front lip spoiler has some scratches from steep driveways. Low<br><br>
