            My husband and I had been looking longingly at digital cameras for about a year. The only thing holding us back from purchasing one was that the main feature we wanted was not affordable in the cameras we were looking at.

Thank goodness for epinions! 
After reading <b>Howard_Creech and Suferdude7's </b>reviews on the <b>Olympus Camedia 3000</b> digital camera we decided we had found the perfect blend of feature and price. 
The main feature we wanted was at least a 3 megapixil quality camera so we could have quality pictures. <b>The Olympus Camedia 3000 is the only 3.4 megapixl camera presently on the market that is under $500.</b>

We certainly could never be considered a high tech pair of people. Therefore this is not going to be a high tech review but rather one on the basics of the camera and how much we enjoy this camera. 
I highly recommend both <b> Howard_Creech and Suferdude7's </b> reviews on this camera for their wonderful descriptions of the technical aspects and different types of photographic applications.

We purchased our <b>Olympus Camedia 3000</b> digital camera from BJ's for $479. 
It came with an 8 megabite smart media card ( this is your digital equivalent of film), a remote, usb cable, NTSC video cable, a camera strap, lens cap, 2 CR-V3 batteries, an instruction manual (about 1/2" thick), computer software, & a 1 year warranty.

Although this camera has many varried modes and functions from 5 Tiff modes and 10 JPEG modes, quick time movie function, black & white & sepia modes, full manual control exposure: apeture, shutter speed and exposure control etc., <b>I am grateful you can also set it to automatic!</b> 
I was never a stick shift kinda girl...give me an automatic! Let the camera decide the exposure and all that. I just set the dial to P and click away.
 
As you can see, however, a technically intelligent person can really put this camera through its paces for any kind of picture they might want to take, altering lighting, shutter speed, resolution, panorama pictures, black & white, sepia, color and on and on.

We have been very happy just using the automatic function with the wonderful crisp clear pictures and the convenience of being able to share our pictures online with family and friends. 
We also have found a great website called Shutterfly.com where we can organize & store our pictures, order prints and create picture cd's to have hard copy of pictures if we desire.

The 8 megabite smart media card that comes with the camera is really not sufficient for pictures as it will only hold 10 High quality pictures. You can erase a bad shot right away if you review it and decide you don't want it.
 
You can take the pictures, upload them to your computer, erase the card and start again, but if you are out taking pictures for the day It's highly likely you will want to take more than 10 shots. It's great knowing you can click away not not be wasting film since you can use the card over and over.

One of the first things we did, after familiarizing ourselves with the camera, was to purchase a <b>128 megabite smart media card</b> from Sam's for $57. It will hold <b>169 high quality pictures.</b> 
You can hold these pictures on the card for as long as you like, erase any pictures you don't like, upload them to your computer for storage and erase the card and start over with 169 picture capacity.

You can review the pictures in the camera one by one or pull up a thumbnail index of up to 9 pictures at a time.

Besides the 2 CR-V3 batteries that come with the camera, you can also use 4 AA lithiium batteries, 4 AA alkaline batteries, 4 AA Ni-Cd batteries, or 4 AA Olympus Ni-MH batteries. 
We purchased 8 rechargeable AA Ni-Cd batteries and a charger so we would always have a fresh set of batteries on hand.  
So far the battery life has been quite good. 
We have played around with the camera, learning some of the functions and have taken almost 200 pictures and still have the original batteries in it.

The Olympus Camedia 3000 is small and lightweight (10.6 oz. without batteries), so we have found it to be quite convenient to carry with us.

We have been having a lot of fun taking pictures and seeing the results immediately on the color LCD. 
Then we can upload them to the computer and see them in large detail and using the software that comes with the camera we can then edit, crop, resize, change the brightness, contrast, erase redeye and sharpen any pictures if we want to. 
We can also compose images with templates; in other words superimpose words and graphics onto the picture to create cards.

I think my daughter has probably had the most fun with the Olympus Camedia 3000 because she isn't afraid to press all the buttons and she has more time to play around with the functions. 
I have found it very helpful to have a teenager in the house to show me how to do something quickly with the camera and not have to stop and read the manual lol. 

<b>One word of warning</b>
While we were looking at cameras I came across some information on the Olympus web site that is worth passing along to anyone considering purchasing this camera.

I found that this camera could be purchased online for a lot less than the $479 we paid for it. 
This information made us think twice about purchasing from an unknown source.

"It has been reported that Olympus Camedia cameras originating from outside the USA available from some internet, Canadian and US dealers are gray market cameras."
It is important, that you are getting a camera that has a USA warranty if you should ever need service. Cameras with out the USA warranty will not be honored by Olympus in the USA. 
Also, European specification cameras are set up for PAL video standards and therefore not compatable with NTSC standards in the USA which will disable the video preview feature.
Cameras originating from Asian countries will not have English language menus.
All Olympus Camedia cameras marketed by Olympus America can be easily identified by distinctive packaging.
For the Olympus Camedia 3000 this will be:
Stock # 225025....UPC code 050332 131286....packaged in a blue box.
