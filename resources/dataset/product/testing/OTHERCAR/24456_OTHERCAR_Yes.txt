            My husband surprised me with the Sony "Cyber-Shot" camera for Christmas. I was thrilled with it and started taking pictures without even checking the manual, it was that easy to use. He had charged it before wrapping it so it was all ready to go. He also bought a memory disk that holds many more pictures than the original disk, around 80 compared to about 16. There was also the plug in cord that connects the camera to our computer so we could upload the pictures and send them out in emails.

Within minutes, I had the CD installed into our computer and was sending a short "movie" to my sister. I'm not at all computer savvy so I can say that this camera and it's features are easy to use.

The camera is small and can be carried around in a purse or small carrier. It comes with a "leash" so you can wear it on your wrist.

The LCD viewfinder/screen is a good enough size to see your subject but it could be a bit bigger to provide the user with accuracy. The user can flip the screen up so it's sticking out above the camera or twist and turn it down so it's set behind the camera. The user can also take self pictures by rotating the screen around. You can hit the menu button and everything pops up on the screen. You can adjust the sharpness ,exposure, flash level, white balance and digital zoom on the Camera section. On the effect section, you can change the date/time and the picture's special effects. The file section lets you format the disk, the image size, etc. And the setup section lets you change the clock, lcd levels, language, and other features. 

The only problems I have with the camera is sometimes my pictures turn out dark. I've adjusted the flash level but still, if I'm not in a bright area, I'd have to adjust the brightness levels after I've taken the picture with a photo shop program. Also, the camera is expensive enough so adding on $160 picture disks can be pricey.
