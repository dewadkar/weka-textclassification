            I wanted something of a megapixel or more, and my husband and I agreed on this camera in March of 2000.  We have used it frequently for family photos since then and are happy with our decision.  Even though technology has improved and prices have dropped since then, this was still a good choice for us.

This camera has all the features we wanted - self timer, flash control, a view window, PC link and software.  It is point and shoot and feels like a film camera in your hand.  Use the viewfinder instead of the LCD display to take your shot, otherwise the batteries will not last.  And I would recommend buying a larger storage card than the standard 8 MB.  I always shoot with super high quality setting and it only holds about 20 images at a time.  Always carry extra batteries (this takes 4 AA).

It's a lot of fun to take pictures and share them immediately with friends, or run a slide show later by linking this to your TV (you can do that with this camera, and run an automatic slide show of the images).  Downloading to your PC is relatively easy.  I have trouble because I already have so many peripherals on my aged machine, but downloading is reliable and the Camedia software that comes with the camera has basic editing tools.  You can also use Camedia to control the camera (set the date and time, delete images, etc.) which I like better than pressing the little buttons on the camera.

This has been dropped and 'used' by my toddler son without incident.  It has everything I need, and I can use it without reading the manual.  Much.
