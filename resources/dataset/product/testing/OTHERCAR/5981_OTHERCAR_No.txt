            I spent $7k on a '91 240 wagon.  When people say that Volvo's last forever, they really mean the engine lasts forever - all the associated parts like the throttle valve cable ($250) and heater valve ($300) and in my case the transmission (~$1500) do not last.  Yeah, it will go 300K miles, but how much will I have spent on associated parts?  I used to have a Honda Civic - all I ever did was put oil in it.  Period.  No associated costs.  None.  I'm really second guessing my Volvo decision.  Otherwise, the car is solid, good mileage, safe, handles well and is very versatile in terms of cargo, etc.  I'm just wondering what's next?  and what will it cost me?!<br><br>
