            I bought this car after my 1988 Civic wagon was totaled (the latter a car I could not recommend to anyone who hopes to live through a side impact collision, which I barely did).
It has dual airbags and side impact beams, which I think were implemented a few years before the Civic's.
My son refers to it as &quot;the tank,&quot; and the ride does feel a little groggy on turns. But in terms of sturdiness and reliability, it's survived a lot, from Houston summers to NJ winters. 
I needed a wagon at the time for the hatch cargo space as opposed to a trunk. The back seats fold down one at a time, as well. We've fit more boxes and things in the back than I would have thought possible from the cargo space, which I think is 67 cu ft without the back seat. 
If you're  buying a used wagon in this price range, you are probably looking at the Saturn, Corolla and/or Camry. The Camry was the same car for more money. The Saturn only has one airbag. The Corolla just seemed less durable to me. I looked at them all back then. I wanted to consider the Impreza, but the dual airbag year model hadn't shipped yet when I needed a new car. 
If driving is in part a &quot;war&quot; against the elements and defending oneself against other drivers, then a tank isn't a bad thing to be in!
