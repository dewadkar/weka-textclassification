                 The only thing this car has going for it is the good look. I have rode in this car and driven it and I do not care for it and would never recommend it to anyone. Trying to get into the car is like trying to fit an elephant in a cracker jack box. I had to swing my head backwards because there is so little head room, the top of my hair touched the roof once I got inside. It is like being in a can of sardines. Everything is right there, in your face. I like room when I drive, I live to be able to breath. This car sits very low on the ground also. The car I am talking about had the transmission fail at 60,000 miles. The owner had an extended warranty which covered the cost of the repair. I would not recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
