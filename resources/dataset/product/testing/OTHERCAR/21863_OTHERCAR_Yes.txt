            I recently bought an Impreza Outback Sport, the &quot;mini&quot; version of the Outback. It certainly isn't as roomy or luxurious as the big Outback, but it works for me.

I love this car! I have always been attracted to the looks for some reason. I'm sure other people find it a bit ugly, but I like it. Something about that scoop/snout and air-holes on the hood and the spoilers on the back. I don't really care for the two-tone paint or the rather ugly interior fabric, and the back seats are pretty tight, but I truly dig the rest of it. 

The first time I drove one was in a downpour. I headed straight for a two lane roundabout freeway on-ramp and took it as fast as I could. It was like driving a Miata on a warm summers' day. I easily passed a number of cars and there was no sign of the tires slipping at all. I drove a Forester next, but it just couldn't offer the same kind of thrill.

The Sport has a 2.2L engine as opposed to the big Outback and Forester's 2.5L, but it is still very peppy. I've been driving a car with a 2.2L Turbo engine for the past 8 years and don't feel like I've really downgraded. I don't know how the automatic does, but the stick-shift that I have darts off the line. It achieves good speed quickly and passing people is no problem. 

And the handling is superb, dry or wet. I live in SoCal and don't have to worry about rain or snow all that much, but at least I know I'll be safe when we finally do get some storms. And it's done really well on the light off-road trails that I've taken it on so far. I'll really give it a test after I'm done breaking it in.

All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase so far. This was my first choice, and I guess my last. I looked at a lot of cars but, aside from a few VW's, nothing could remotely compare to it. The sticker price might seem expensive, but when you look at everything that comes standard (air, cruise control, power everything, radio, ABS, AWD...) it ends up being a really great deal. Once you start adding those things to a Saturn or Civic or Corolla the price ends up being about the same... and then you're stuck driving a Saturn or Civic or Corolla... and you still don't get AWD or something that is such a blast to drive and has so much personality.
