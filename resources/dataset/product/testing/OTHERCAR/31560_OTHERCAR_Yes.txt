            My first car was a 1978 Volvo 242, a vision of seventies design and Swedish sensibility!  The Volvo 240 series makes a perfect &quot;first car&quot; for any teen.  Mine was cute, fun to drive, decently comfortable for long trips, and above all: safe!

Volvo builds cars that are stronger than the average tank.  They take a beating with smile, and will still be running when your kids have kids!  After a serious accident in mine (totalled the body, engine was fine) I was completely convinced that these cars should be mandatory for young drivers.  The accident I was in would have killed me in a smaller car.  In the Volvo I had zero injuries. 

The obsession with airbags has left people with the idea that safety is a matter of a giant balloon exploding in your lap.  What good does that balloon do when the engine has also been thrown in your lap?  Volvos are indestructible, with heavy steel cages and a completely secured passenger compartment.

The other key safety feature of the Volvo 240 series is the superior visibility they offer... better visibility equals fewer accidents.  In short, if you have teens, you can't put them in anything safer than a used Volvo.  There are tons around for good prices, and they are remarkably reliable for their age.<br><br>
