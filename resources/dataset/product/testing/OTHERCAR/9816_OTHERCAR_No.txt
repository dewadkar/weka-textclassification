            We bought our 97 30th. anniversary edition Z-28 new, and the total bill came to $31,273.15 with tax, title, license, etc.  From the start, we had trouble with it. Less than a week into it, the car just stopped running in rush hour traffic. It turned out that a part of the fuel injection had mal-functioned. The car spent the night in the shop and I was not offered a loaner, despite the fact that the mercedes I traded in on it sat in the front row of the used car sales. A month later, several parts on the engine went out at once The dealer replaced the head gaskets first, two days in the shop, and I was given a Geo Metro loaner! The head gaskets did not cure the problem, so a week later, the dealer replaced the heads. Still not fixed, when they returned it to me, it was leaking oil while running, and the problem was still not fixed. So, back in the shop, this time to replace the entire engine. This finally fixed the problem. [I was getting coolant in the oil] But the clutch was slipping, so, back to the shop. This time, the new engine was leaking oil onto the clutch. That was repaired and the clutch was replaced. Two days later, the brakes went out, that was caused when a brake line was nicked when they replaced the engine. When the brakes went out, my wife wrecked into the rear-end of a new toyota. Chevrolet and the dealer paid for the damage, but my insurance rates went up because of the accident! Next the radio went out, then the wipers stopped working, later the power window on the drivers door went out. The list goes on and on. After owning this car for 10 months, I had put up with all I could take, so I went back to same chevrolet dealer and attempted to trade it in on a nice used BMW they had on the used car lot. I was sure that I would get money back on the deal. They were asking $19,995 for the BMW, I was SHOCKED to learn that the trade-in value on my 10 month old, 7,000 mile $31,000 camaro was ONLY $14,500!!!!!!! Less than 1/2 of what I paid. To this day, that camaro sits in my garage, un-used for the past 2 years, with 7000 original miles on it. I will not sell this car because it would be like taking money from someone to give them a big problem. I'll let it sit there for 20 years until its considered a collector car, then maybe, I can get my money back out of it!  I would not recommend this car to ANYONE!!!!
..........UPDATE!!!!!.....September 5, 2000...........
I listed this car for sale in a national publication and sold it on July 15th of this year [2000] for $27,500. [I was asking $29,900]
 The car had sat in my garage for over 2 years. I never even started it once.  When the buyer called and asked why I had only driven the car 6,873 miles, I told him everything, I even refered him to THIS web site. He came out and looked at my car, looked over the paperwork and the records, even talked to dealership that sold it to me. We reached a selling price of $27,500, and he had funds wired to my bank account. NOW, HERE IS WHERE IT GETS CUTE!!! I called the dealership up and asked them to come with a wrecker to get the car and take it in for service, as it still had bumper to bumper warranty left. Since it had sat for so long, the battery was dead, and I figured that a professional chevrolet mechanic should give it a once-over before it was started or driven. They towed it to the shop, replaced the battery and got it running. The mechanic drove the car around for 12 miles and returned to the dealer. I went home at this point. The new owner was preparing to drive the car home when he noticed that the air-conditioning switch was not working properly. Instead of having several speeds, it only worked on high. He asked the mechanic to check it. The mechanic drove it into the service bay, left it running, and went to get some tools. When he returned, the inside of the car was full of smoke, and flames were comming out of the defrostrer vent. They imedeatly got a fire-extinguisher on it and put it out, but not before extensive damage was done to the inside of the car. To make a long story short, when they pulled the dash apart to find the cause of the fire, they found what had been causing ALL the trouble with the car's electrical system. The main 12 volt line that went into the fuse box had a rip in it's plastic insulating cover and was arching to the grounding block. This caused a power surge situation that was making all the electrical systems in the car burn out. A rep from General Motors came out to have a look at it, and said it was most likely damaged when they assembeled the car. It just so happened that the guy who bought my car was a corporate attorney who had represented General Motors in that nasty &quot;chevrolet pick-up truck side impact class action lawsuit problem&quot; Since he had a direct line to the top management at General Motors, they were more than happy to re-imburse him the $27,500 he had paid to me. Well, that brings an end to my automotive nightmare. I hope all of you are smart enough to learn the lessons contained within this letter. Although the short was responsible for the electrical problems, the car still went thru 2 engines, and brought me a truck load of greif!!!  I still would not reccomend this car to anyone!<br><br>
