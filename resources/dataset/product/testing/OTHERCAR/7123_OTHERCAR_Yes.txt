            If any of you have owned the last generation Miata, trade it now for the new generation.  If you've never owned a convertible before, this is a great place to start.  

The new Miata is a significantly improved car.  The ride is much smoother, it's more nimble and quick, the stereo system is vastly improved, and there's actually space in the trunk for a real suitcase.  Some additional high points are that it's wider and longer, and you can definitely feel the difference inside.  A major improvement is the rear glass window--no more unzipping the plastic window which, by the way, discolors and is impossible to defrost in cold weather.

Some lows to consider:  Even though the trunk is bigger, don't expect miracles.  If you're traveling with a friend, one of you will need to ship your luggage ahead.  And don't plan on large shopping sprees or a month's-worth of grocery shopping.  It just won't fit.  But then again, you don't buy this car for its practicality--you buy it for fun and for its sex appeal.  Also, some of the positioning of switches remains awkward.  In particular, the automatic window switches are too far back on the console, and the latch to open the console is completely at the back--not very convenient.  Also, the cup holder is awkwardly located.  with a cup in it, your right arm can't help but hit it--especially if you have manual transmission.

Overall, I highly recommend this car.  It's solid, fun, and grabs lots of attention.  It's a quintessential grown-up toy.<br><br>
