            I bought my NEW 1999 Jeep 2d, 4wd, automatic Sahara because it was cute.  Don't make my mistake.  I had the baby for just over a year when the first problem made itself known-and loudly. 
I was sitting at a stop sign, with my food on the brake, transmission in drive,waiting for cross traffic to pass when my Jeep began to scream.  It was the loudest, most horrible I have EVER heard a vehicle make.  It was a combination of screeching, grinding and any other noise that can seriously scare the you know what out of you.  I had to back my Jeep into a service station because it would not go forward.  The dealership had to tow it back on a flatbed wrecker because the rear end had locked up due to defective factory bolts.  I don't think that I had ever been so mad in all my life.
2nd problem:  I was trying to use my defroster one morning and all it would do was squeal at me.  There was no air coming from the top vent.  We called our dealer ship and they sent a repairman out - 3 times total - to try and remedy the reoccuring problem.  He ever tried to fix the vent with a  wire clothes hanger once! Eventually, I had to take it back to the dealership so they could replace the ENTIRE a/c unit.  
OK.  
Finally, problem number 3.  I'm on my way to Wal-Mart and driving along smoothly when all of the gauges on my dash go to zero.  I was, well, cursing quite loudly.  In frustration, I banged on the top of the dash and the gauges began to work again.  This went on until I took it into the dealer a week later.  They said it was no problem and they would have the recall fixed in less than an hour.  RECALL?!  What recall?  Why wasn't I informed of this??   They told me that Chrysler was only doing the recall on a case by case basis since it is not a safety hazard.  By the way, that hours fix took 8 hours.  
Save yourself the trouble  and the $23,000 and buy what I have now- A 2000 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner.     <br><br>
