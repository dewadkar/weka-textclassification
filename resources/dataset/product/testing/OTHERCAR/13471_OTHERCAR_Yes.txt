            With gas prices as high as they are today, the Geo Metro LSi convertible is a fun and economical way to get to and from work.  This is the car I wish I had when I was a college student -- it's cheap to drive and it's a lot of fun.

This is not a car for tall people.  If you're over six feet tall, you will likely find the small size uncomfortable.  It's also not for families, since there is no back seat, or for people who need a lot of trunk space.  I also wouldn't recommend it for long trips.  I have driven it on 14-hour trips and it was more tiring than if I had been driving a larger car.

The car does not have the pickup of a larger car, especially when the air conditioner is running, but it is still fairly nimble, and you can easily keep up with traffic on the highway.  Highway driving can be a bit loud, as is the case with other convertibles.  Parking is a breeze with this little car -- you can fit in tight spaces and parallel park in spots that others have to turn down. 

When I had to replace my tires, I learned that the LSi uses an unusual size and even some major tire stores do not have them in stock.  When they are in stock, they are not cheap.  I paid $85 per tire and I did not have the luxury of choosing between brands due to the special size.  

The convertible top is easy to get up and down (must be done manually), and I have found that the back window is still in good shape after several years of sitting outside in all kinds of weather.  Occasionally the roof has leaked, but this has only been during exceptionally heavy rainstorms or going through the car wash.  

Many times I have parked my car on the street or in a parking lot and saw people admiring my car.  People have commented to me, "That's a great-looking car," and "That car looks fun to drive," and I've had several people ask me questions about it.  I'm always happy to talk to them about what I like and dislike about the car.

This car rides low to the ground, and this can be a problem when driving beside or behind trucks and SUVs.  It can be difficult to impossible to see around them, and occasionally I felt less than safe.  

Being such a small car, it handles surprisingly well in bad weather.  I drove this car in several tropical storms while living in Florida and even in winds exceeding 50 miles per hour, I did not have too much trouble handling my Geo.  Friends at work would comment, "I bet your car just about blew off the road," but that was never the case.

Overall, I've been very happy with my Geo and feel I definitely got my money's worth from this car.  It's no luxury sedan, but it'll get you where you need to go economically ... and you'll have a lot of fun when the top is down!
