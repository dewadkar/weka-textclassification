               My opinion of this van has changed, now that I've owned it for 6 months. I needed something to pull a 4200 pound travel trailer and family.  It still runs like the dickens with it's steadfast 318c.i. V8.  It's got an overdrive button that, when engaged, locks out 4th gear for use when pulling a trailer around town. 
   I got almost 18mpg on a short day trip (no trailer) but 14 is the norm around town. It rides really nice, moderate acceleration seems too long in 1st gear then when it shifts, you feel like your moving much swifter. Flooring it really makes waves &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;.
   The cruise control didn't work when I test drove it so I can accept that. The speedometer did work, initially. Now only about half the time.
   The rear air didn't work but I found where the fuse was and replaced it. Then it barely worked and only for a few months. The fuse was still ok. 

   The most annoying thing that I overlooked was where the front wheels are located. Similar to a Chevy but not like the Ford's, The wheel wells extend back into the driver/passenger doors making for little space for the drivers feet. It gets uncomfortable having only one spot to put your feet. I've even come close to running into things because I've tried putting my left foot under the brake pedal then when stopping, I couldn't push it down far enough to stop as quickly as I would've liked.  Do I crush my foot, or let up on the brake to get my foot out in time to reapply it?  There's no where else to put your foot except the wheel hump. The carpet is getting worn out in that lone spot. My Toyota pickup and Plymouth Voyager have 3 times more feet room and they're  &quot;mini's&quot;.

   Visibility is limited. The windows have pull down shades that open to about 3 inches from the top. The rear sofa/fold down bed, has headrests that really limit rear view mirror sight. There are 3 of them and there's a sticker advising that they remain there for occupant saftey  and a clothes hanger pole that goes across the back doors right in line of the space between the top of the headrests and the bottom of the rear shades. Trying to remove the pole results in tearing the cloth on the side walls.  At night when backing up, better get out and check things out.

Maybe another nit pick but I noticed that water runoff from the windshield drains right on top of the battery. That would explain why the battery floor metal has cancer.  I see that the new body style Chevy vans and the Ford's ( as always) have more space for your feet. I'm ready to move on...
