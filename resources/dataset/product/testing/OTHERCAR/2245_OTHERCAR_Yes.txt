               <b>U</b>ntil the launch of the Tiburon, Hyundai's image was very bland and low-budget to say the most. The swooping lines and curves of the exterior and excellent road manners of the Tiburon coupe instantly won acclaim from teenagers-senior citizens alike.                

<b>Driving Impressions:</b> 

A very welcoming sight greets you as you slip behind the wheel of the 1999 Tiburon FX. The dashboard is stark black, and has a very Japanese styled interior. The cabin of the 1999 Tiburon boasts interestingly shaped vents and round gauges. First impressions on the move are very favorable. The wide torque band makes progress easy, and outright performance is acceptable but still lacks the kick of other sports cars in the same class. The chassis proves to be grippy and very adjustable on the throttle; great fun, especially when you dial in the quick and accurate steering. Hills are taken fairly well, a down-shift from 5th to 4th is usually necessary, but once down-shifted this car has access to all of its 140 horses so hill climbing can be accomplished with ease.
      
<b>A 'little' info about this 'little' engine:</b> The 2.0 liter, twin cam, 4-cylinder engine was designed and developed by Hyundai in Korea. With and alloy head, five bearings, four valves per cylinder and electronic  multipoint fuel injection. The engine revs eagerly and powerfully with  140 HP at a peaky 6,000 RPM. The base engine in the Tiburon for 1999 is a 1.8 liter that pumps out only 130 HP, and in some markets overseas a 1.6 114 hp engine is available. Clearly the FX model with the 2.0 140 HP is the best choice for those who crave the most bang for their buck.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
      
The <b>interior</b> is very modern, semi luxurious, yet sporty. Interior room is a little cramped although. I was very surprised with how good of a job Hyundai did with this interior. The Tiburon's curvaceous dash panels houses clear and easy to read gauges. Amenities are plenty for any car enthusiast, except the most picky. A sunroof, cruise control, etc. are all optional. AC, power everything, etc. are standard on the FX model. After being lavished in such sweet surroundings it just makes you wish this car had a turbo/supercharger or more power period to 'livin' things up a little. For 2003 Hyundai has a new Tiburon, it's much improved in all respects, yet still lacks the excitement many cars in the same category possess.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
     
The <b>exterior</b> is very aggressive for a car in this class! Original looks, frameless windows, which make it look classy and clean. Bold, imaginative, and individualistic is probably my best way to describe this design. Balanced proportions set off boldly styled curves over the front and rear arches. The FX comes with attractive 5-spoke alloy wheels, low profile 195/55 Hr 15 Michelin tires are standard.


<i>Pricing:</i>
           
The <b>Price</b> for a 1999 Hyundai Tiburon is around $11,000-12,000 so its not cheap yet, but with the new V6 model coming out for 2002 I expect people will be selling their older Tiburon's as fast as possible, so prices will be going down.

     I've only test driven this car, so I can not comment on how reliable it is, so far I have heard of no major complaints other than people wishing they would have bought a more powerful car.
