            Great little camera small and compact , which made it very attractive to me, movie mode feature was a plus considering it was for added on the camera as a bonus, it takes very good pictures but drains batteries when the viewfinder is on, and also the viewfinder is quite dark indoors compared to other digital cameras, but is ok in the daytime outdoors with bright sunlight, another thing is the plastic LCD viewfinder attracts a lot of lint as a magnet and a friend of mine had one that attracted so much lint on the LCD that it got into the inside of the cameras viewfinder and the camera was basically ruined, but that was the lesson I learned and a lesson to you too if you plan on or have already bought the camera and that is to protect the viewfinder because they (Fuji ) had the urge to make the viewfinder stick out on the back of the camera like its a stand or something when the camera sits on the back side with the lens facing up, don't know why this is the only camera that seems to have a scratchable viewfinder used as the cameras stand or something, so other than a dark viewfinder on indoor shots and a carton of batteries needed on vacation shots if need to review your shots then this is a very nice camera for the money with very good pictures too.
