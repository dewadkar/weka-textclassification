            I purchased this vehicle as a lease.  The lease on my car was about to expire, and I needed a replacement.  Being in real estate, I needed something that could carry an extra 4 people, get around in rough terrain, and get good gas mileage.  The Honda CRV was the answer!

For the time that I had this vehicle, it served me pretty well.  The only thing that bothered me was the lack of a passenger side left arm rest.  The back had them, but the from didn't. I thought that was pretty stupid.

This is a good vehicle for just about anyone.  If it only had an arm rest....<br><br>
