            Shhhhh! I�m in love with another <i>van</i>-don�t tell my husband!! Our trusty old 1992 GMC Safari was rear-ended last month and has been in the repair shop all week. In its place I have had the most wonderful vehicle to use, and I loathed returning it and getting my old van back!

What <i>is</i> this wonderful vehicle, you may wonder? Well, let me tell you all about it!! The wonderful vehicle that I have fallen in love with is a 1999 <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager SE</b>. It has a powerful, but whisper quiet, 3.3L engine, antilock brakes, a towing capacity up to 3,500 lbs and a 20-gallon gas tank. This particular vehicle has a long wheelbase, which gives it more interior room for cargo and people. I was able to fit a 4.5� x 6.5� Little Tikes swimming pool in it with NO trouble!!

This vehicle is packed with so many neat convenience features--I�ll start at the driver�s seat and work my way backward. The driver�s seat in this vehicle was quite comfy and felt nice and firm. (I am of short stature as is my husband, and we both found this vehicle to be comfortable while driving or as a passenger.) While this vehicle did not have a power adjustable seat, it is an available option. The steering wheel tilts and has the cruise control on it, which I found very handy.

The premium instrument cluster not only has the standard items, but it also has a low fuel light, cruise control light and a low washer fluid light. There is a turn signal malfunction warning, which lets the driver know if one of the bulbs needs replacing. (I thought this was a rather neat feature!) Also, there is what I would term the �lazy driver�s chime� that will alert the driver if he or she has driven farther than a mile at a speed over 15 mph with the turn signal still on. (My own dear husband is guilty of doing this time and time again, so I thought this is one super neat gadget!!) 

Between the driver and front passenger�s seats, in the ceiling, there is a console that has a map light for the driver and one for the passenger. It has a special compartment for holding a pair of sunglasses and a garage door opener compartment that allows the driver to simply store the opener and <i>use</i> it without having to even open the compartment door!

The lower console, on the floor between the driver and front passenger, houses a pullout adjustable cup holder drawer that has room for two very large cups. The drawer also has storage slots for coins or tokens, and a place for pencils or your gas card! Located underneath the pullout drawer there is a slot that will hold a package of travel size tissues and below that is a kind of scooped out area that looked like it would make a great place to house the vehicle�s trash bin. The console also houses an AM/FM/Cassette stereo above the pullout drawer. The stereo has sliding treble and bass controls and terrific sound. The vehicle�s climate controls are located close to the stereo and were easy for me to reach and use while driving. The driver and front passenger can independently control the temperature of the air being blown on them. I can see that this would be VERY helpful for those long road trips when the driver and front passenger cannot agree on the same temperature in the vehicle!! (Gee, does that ever happen?) There are also four air vents in the rear of the vehicle; one for each outer passenger, which allows better circulation of either cooled or heated air. (I wish our own van had this feature, but at least for the week I did not have to listen to my children yell from the back seat for me to &quot;turn on the air conditioning&quot; when it was already running full blast!) 

This van is set up to seat 7; two captain chairs up front, a two-passenger bench in the middle row and a three-passenger bench in the rear. The rear seat can be installed in the middle row to make a 5-passenger van with a larger cargo space. Each bench seat has wheels to facilitate moving and removal. (My husband sure wishes our van had these!!) There are no cup holders for the middle row passengers, but the rear passengers have two cup holders for each outer seat! (I suppose that is in case they become VERY thirsty? It sure would become annoying for those in the middle bench seat to always bug those sitting behind them to pass their drinks to them time and time again!)

There are small storage spaces inside the armrests of the third row seating area and these are much smaller than in our Safari. (Well, at least my van has <i>something</i> better!) They would make great map storage or a place for children to store a rolled up coloring book or two and a box of crayons! On the back of the 3-passenger bench, there are 7 plastic grocery bag retainer clips. Oh, how I <i>WISH</i> my van had this!! Although I did not have this van long enough to be able to take it grocery shopping for my huge family of 7, I can see how handy these would be. I have had to crawl all over the floor of my own van many times to chase after all the groceries that rolled out of their bags during the drive back home. 

The rear tailgate of the <i>Voyager</i> is one BIG door that opens upward from the floor of the vehicle. I do not care for this feature and much prefer the Dutch Doors that my Safari has because it does not take as much room behind the vehicle to open the tailgate on my Safari as it does to open the Voyager. (My Safari has two doors on the bottom that open outward from the center and the upper door lifts upward and gives me an unobstructed view of the traffic behind me.) However, I have to hand it to the folks at Plymouth-the tailgate was easy to open and not the least bit hard to pull back down and close it. I had no trouble reaching the handle, either, and I'm on the short side at 5' 4&quot; tall. The window in the tailgate has a built-in defroster, windshield wiper and washer.

This particular <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager SE</b> has the dual sliding door feature. I found this to be so handy with my five children! I still have two children in car seats and this allowed me to have the older four get in by themselves on one side of the vehicle while I brought their little sister over to the other side and buckled her into her car seat. This was a great time-saver and such a treat for the week after always having just <i>one</i> sliding door in our Safari! 

I had to fill the gas tank in the van before returning it (or else I would have to pay an exorbitant rate for the rental company to refill it and gas prices are high enough as it is!) and found another neat feature inside the gas door; the gas cap has a <i>leash!!</i> That would certainly put an end to the perpetual lost gas cap problem we have all experienced from time to time!   

Although this van is only a 1999, it already had 40,000 miles on it. With all of those miles on it I expected it to have a few squeaks and rattles like my own van has, but it was still as quiet as if it were brand new! The ride was very smooth and it rode much like a car. I have to admit that I was very impressed with this van and if I were to go out and replace my Safari tomorrow I would be very likely to purchase a <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager SE</b> very much like this one! 

Oh, WHY did the body shop have to be so speedy with their repair job?? (sniff!)
