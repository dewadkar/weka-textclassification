            I've been researching the Chrysler PT Cruiser for about a year, now -- ever since the first rumors surfaced about this car. I've read probably 90% of the opinions and reviews posted all over the Web (at least, based on what my favorite search engines churn up). And, I must say, I'm confused...

Almost every Article I read contains a line that says (paraphrasing) &quot;...the power is disappointing...&quot; -- and then goes on to state the weight &quot;problem&quot; and 0-to-60 mph speed tests on this car. The implication being that it somehow fails in its product range when compared against other vehicles, or that it is grossly underpowered.

So, I set out to try and find out the reality.
Are these opinions based on facts, or suppositions?

My first stop was my local Dealer. Actually, the local one(s) nearest to my home would not even allow a Test Drive...so I travelled for one hour to Heritage Chrysler Plymouth in Baltimore, Maryland. That Dealership has retained at least one vehicle for Test Drives since day one, and I thoroughly appreciated getting the chance to drive it around the block. Truth to tell, it felt pretty much like my 1991 Honda Accord! And this was the automatic (my Honda is a Manual). I never felt in danger when pulling out into traffic, or taking off from a stoplight.

Next, I signed up for one of Chrysler's &quot;Driving Events.&quot; There, I again could only drive an Automatic (no Manuals were available) -- but I was allowed to &quot;floor it&quot; in a short straight-away abbreviation of a 1/4-mile test, along with taking it through an &quot;obstacle&quot; course and over rough road conditions. I was very impressed, based on the so-called disappointments that the various Reviews kept mentioning. Again, I felt it had just as good acceleration as my Honda Accord. The braking was superb (but I'll offer up the idea it might've been because the car was so new -- albeit, probably having been driven by hundreds of other individuals over several recent weeks).

Finally, after reading a Review on a new bolt-on Turbo-charging kit that claims to give the car an extra second or two advantage from 0-to-60, I decided to go compare the statistics between a 2001 Honda Accord EX and the PT. I've never felt I needed a Turbo in my Accord, so I thought I'd compare it against something tangible that I have 14 years experience with.

I can't understand all the concerns that have been expressed. Based on my research, the following direct comparisons can be made:

Valves = 16 in both cars

0-to-60 Times = 8.5-to-8.9 seconds for the PT (depending on the Magazine that did the testing) vs 9.4 for the Accord

Weight = 3,123 pounds for the PT vs 3,020 for the Accord

Torque = 162@4,000 RPM for the PT vs 152@4,900 for the Accord

Engines = 2.4 L for the PT vs 2.3 for the Accord

Towing Capacity = 1,000 pounds stated for both cars

1/4-Mile Results = 16.7 Seconds for the PT vs 17.20 for the Accord

Horsepower = 150@5,000 RPM for the PT vs 150@5,700 for the Accord

So, I just don't get it!
Most of these Reviewers must be expressing a desire that the power of the PT match a 6-cylinder car, a street rod, or beat a Corvette or something. It must be the looks that instill this desire. But declaring that it is underpowered is, perhaps, a little unfair. I've driven Accords since 1986, and I've never heard them referred to as &quot;underpowered&quot;. Granted, they aren't as cool-looking as the PT. But, then again, a great looking package should not be the reason for declaring the car to be inadequate in some way. Personally, if my Accord looked as great as the PT and had the same practical utilitarian advantages, I wouldn't have ordered the PT just a few days ago!

Would I like a Turbo version?
Possibly.
But I'm not sure that getting from 0-to-60 in two extra seconds is worth the $3,500 price tag for such an &quot;advantage&quot;. Increased torque would possibly feel better, too -- so I won't argue there. But I could get better torque driving a BMW Z3, too, right?

If you're considering the PT Cruiser and are put off by the declarations concerning its being grossly underpowered, I'd suggest you try comparing it to something you're familiar with.

There is, however, one bald-faced lie that I've seen posted elsewhere (most notably, the archived &quot;chat&quot; transcript at the PT Cruiser website, between Web users and certain Chrysler managers or engineers). The rear area, behind the rear seat, will definitely NOT hold a regulation-sized adult golf bag with clubs if it is placed width-wise. A Junior Set? Maybe. But not a typical driver or set of woods within a golf bag. Bummer!<br><br>
