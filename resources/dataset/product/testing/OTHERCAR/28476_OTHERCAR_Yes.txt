            First of all I know that I am speaking of a model that probably is not sold in USA, but some of the toughts I want to share maybe are useful also for the majority of epinioners.
I bought my 1.6 secondhand in 1998, it was a mere 10 months old courtesy car owned by the dealer I bought with a really huge discount.
Since then I can't remember the smallest problem, the car works fine and driving it is really a pleasure.
The thing I like most is the way it handles the road: the rear suspension works really fine so I prefer to think to my car as a FamilyCoupe rather than as a Station Wagon (this is has a con since the rear luggage is not so huge as someone can expect from a Volvo).
As a recommendation I suggest to see it in red paint (my one) or metallic dark green.
I already recommended this car to several friends and some of them also bought it and are very satisfied with it.
One of them owns a T4 and, apart from the fuel consumption, he is really satisfied with it since it has a very good acceleration.
Now in Europe the V40 is also sold with a 110HP Turbodiesel that should be a good choice given gasoline price here (in Italy 1 liter costs more than 1$...).<br><br>
