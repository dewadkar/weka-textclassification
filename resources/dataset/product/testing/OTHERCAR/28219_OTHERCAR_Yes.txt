            If you are looking for a little more power in your SUV, the Dodge Durango is the way to go.  With a V8 magnum engine and a huge frame the Durango provides all the power you can handle.  With a fold up third row of seats, the Durango is also the perfect family car.  This car can hold 8 passengers, safely and comfortably.  I have not run into a single problem with the Durango so far, and I have had mine for over 6 months now.  The only concern I have to pass on to perspective buyers, is its very bad gas mileage.  However if you don't have any problems with putting in the money to fill up this huge tank, then you will have no worries at all with the durango.  Although the durango looks like a complete truck, it doesn't drive with that stiff type of ride.  However it does drive with great power and force.  If you have the money to put towards a SUV, look no further than the Dodge Durango. <br><br>
