             We purchased this vehicle because we have four children and did not want a minivan. This was the perfect alternative. 
 The rear seats are quite simple to operate and when folded down there is more than enough room for most cargo. The only draw back is the cargo room is greatly reduced when the third seat is in operation. A rooftop cargo box, which attaches directly to the factory load bars, solves this problem at very little cost. With the 5.2 Liter V8 there is plenty of power. It was a pleasant surprise to hear the V8 fire up for the first time after listening to whiny V6's and 4 bangers for a number of years. I will admit I am not in love with the gas mileage but it isn't much lower than an SUV with a V6.
 This truck has a smooth ride and handles curves with very little lean. Some of the other SUVs we drove felt like they were going to tip over. During a trip to North Carolina we actually saw one (S10 Blazer) turn over right in front of us. We feel very safe when we are in our Durango.
 The Durango is the perfect size with plenty of people/cargo room and it is priced comparably to the smaller SUVs.
