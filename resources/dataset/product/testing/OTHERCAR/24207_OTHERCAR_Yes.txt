            I bought this camera primarily for business use, but now find myself using it for pleasure.
The original premise was a simple one. My customers would send me out to evaluate a machine, and of course they would want photos along with my report. The old fashioned method required locating a photo lab, waiting the usual one hour, then finding a post office and sending everything by express mail. Now I shoot, write and send via email. It is quicker, and simpler.
But much to my surprise, now I find myself taking the camera everywhere. The Sony is so simple to use, recharges quickly, and lasts a whole day between charges. I have even taken great nighttime shots without anything fancy accessories.
Having the display on a moveable panel really helps for taking pictures in difficult locations. Glare from the sun can easily be avoided and pictures can be taken at right angles to your line of sight. During a parade I was able to hold the camera out in front of me and take pictures of the approaching attractions by turning the display panel sideways. In a cave I was able to use a pen light to see the display without the light interfering with the shot, by having the display turned sideways.
I would highly recommend this camera.<br><br>
