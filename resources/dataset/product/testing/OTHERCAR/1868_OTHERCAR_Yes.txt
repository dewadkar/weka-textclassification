            I purchased my '92 Grand Am SE in 1993.  Drove it mostly on the highway.  It has been ludicrously  reliable for what I would have expected from an American Made Car.  The seats cradle the body and are comfortable for 5' tall me and my 6' 2&quot; husband on long road trips, It has a significant amount of storage space, and the seats lay back to make an adequate bed on those REALLY long middle-of-the-night trips.  After seven years and 188,000 miles, it's still running strong.  I have only had to replace a transmission sensor and completed routine maintenance, such as tires, oil changes, brakes, shocks, and tuning about every 50,000 miles.  When well maintained, it retains a smooth, relatively quiet ride.  My husband owns a 95 Grand Am, which has had a few more problems than mine, but has also proven to be quite reliable.  Even the gas mileage has remained at an even 30 mpg.  I still can't tell when I'm going over 75 miles an hour--so I use cruise regularly.  It does need freon for the AC now, but I'm not going to bother, given it's age and lack of resale value at this point.  I was most attracted by the fact that the body is substantial as opposed to the many &quot;tin cans&quot; on the road.  My version does not have an airbag, but that's no problem for me--I would most likely be killed by one, given my small stature.

My only objections:  the high beam light is blindingly bright, so I've put a colored candy wrapper over it to tone it down.  The paint job on the hood of the car started peeling within a few years, but Pontiac had it repainted at no cost to me.  The gas gauge is horribly inaccurate, but it's easy enough to reset the trip odometer and go no more than the 14 gallon tank will bear.  I've never run out of gas, and I've pushed it on many occasion.  There's nothing fancy on my model, except the automatic locks--which tend to not work when it's very cold or rains a lot--don't even ask--the dealer just looked at me funny.  One other significant problem--one which would prevent me from buying this car again--there are significant blind spots at the windows that could easily prevent seeing someone coming before you pull out into the middle of the street.  Oh--and it has developed a rattle in the dashboard.<br><br>
