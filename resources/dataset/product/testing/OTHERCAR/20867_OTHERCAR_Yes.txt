            My parents picked up their Chrysler PT Cruiser just a little over three weeks ago. Mom is in heaven, she can't go anywhere without someone stopping to talk to her about her car and to get a little tour. First though I have to explain to you about my parents car shopping routine.

Dad goes car shopping at numerous dealers, test drives, dickers and finally brings the car home to mom for the final approval. Mom's stipulations are; must be an automatic and not be a &quot;boat&quot; so it can be easily taken in and out of the garage without removing the side view mirrors and can be parked with ease in a space made for a bus. So as you can see my mom generally could care less about what she drives. That was until she saw <b>the car</b>.

They happened to be on a drive and passed by the Chrysler dealer in Waterford, Pa. and they had this very unusual looking car sitting out by the road. They had also seen them on tv, so they thought they would stop to have a look. And believe me, look is all they did. Since all PT Cruisers at the present time are customer order cars, they couldn't even test drive one. But they were permitted to sit in the Cruiser and get the sales pitch. Right then and there mom decided she wanted one, and since she had never said that to my dad before, I think he thought he had better get one for her.

They went to the local dealership in Titusville, Pa. and ordered one the next day. I can imagine my dad's disappointment at the no dickering rule, book price for their old car and that was that. Although some dealerships are charging various dealer charges, the base rate for this car is $16,000.00 with the Limited Edition of the car reaching  $20,000.00. 

In case you may not have seen one of these unusual looking cars on the street yet, they are similar looking to a 1938 Ford Coupe Street Rod. They are advertised as a combination mini van and SUV. My mom calls it her &quot;Little Truckster&quot;.

Ordering Information; the colors available for the PT Cruiser are, Aquamarine, Black, Blue, Cranberry, Green, Red, Silver, Taupe, and White. My mother choose the Cranberry which I would have expected to be a deep burgundy color, but this car is a pretty deep purple color metallic. I personally have seen the Black, Red, Silver and White also, but my mom's seems to really stand out from these.

The interior colors are all exactly the same with these cars, a grey color with the exterior color of the car being used for the glove box door and the area around the stereo.

Chrysler is offering two packages of this car available for order, my parents opted for the base car for $16,000, the base car has power windows, air conditioning, rear defroster and wiper, six-speaker AM-FM cassette and 15-inch chrome wheels. The Limited Edition base priced at$19,995 comes with just about everything but the kitchen sink, including leather upholstery, side-impact airbags, glass sunroof and chromed 16-inch wheels. Options available on this Limited Edition Cruiser include ABS, automatic transmission, 16-inch painted aluminum wheels, engine block heater, CD changer and a roof rack. 

All PT Cruisers have a 2.4 Liter, 16 valve, 4 cylinder engine and can be ordered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While my parents ordered the automatic (there is no way that my mom would drive a stick), what fun is it to have a car like this without shifting?

The storage space in this little car is incredible. The rear seats both fold down to extend your cargo area, but once the seats are folded down they are a snap to remove. In the back of each rear seat is a small handle, they will lift out just like a suitcase.

The rear cargo compartment is larger than you would think and has the added &quot;tailgate party&quot; feature. There is a multi-position shelf panel that will actually slide out with a center &quot;leg&quot; that will drop down and lock into position so that you have a little &quot;table&quot; in your cargo compartment. My parents Cruiser also has a cargo net in the rear to keep your &quot;cargo&quot; from rolling around.

I was actually surprised when I saw this car parked in my parents garage. It is tiny! These are built on a Dodge Neon body, and took up only about 3/4 of the space that their 1997 Mercury Sable did. Although it is a little taller than the Sable.

Don't be in a big hurry to get this car. As I mentioned all are customer order cars and the waiting list is now up to eight months, my parents got lucky at four. And the rumor is that each dealer is only going to be allotted so many of these to sell, I heard the number three mentioned. My mom was so excited that she actually traced her Cruiser down three days before it arrived at the dealer. It was sitting in a railroad yard in Indiana waiting for a truck to pick it up, these are made in Mexico so it had quite a journey to Pennsylvania.

Okay now for the driving test, please remember that I grew up in the Muscle Car era and personally owned a 1964 GTO convertible with a 389 Tri-power! First of all we have to get rid of this classical music station preprogramed into the stereo. Pop in my Beach Boys tape and we are set to go CRUISE! Okay the seats are comfy, gearshift in my right hand, gas pedal under right foot, clutch.... Whoops, automatic! Alright off we go.

Lots of head and leg room, will comfortably seat four adults. Okay, it drives nice but I am not overly impressed. I can tell that it only has a four cylinder motor, certainly won't do a eight second quarter mile. It does corner a little better than the classic muscle cars. It has that typical front wheel drive feel to it, still can't get used to that. Wow, people sure do stare at you going down the road! All in all it is a nice little car, corners well, gets great gas mileage and is a big head turner. My mom loves her &quot;Little Truckster&quot;, she just wanted a sharp looking car, which she got, she only drives into town once a day so she wanted something with good gas mileage, which she got. If my mom got what she wanted, that is great, but when looking at this car, I expected a little more out of it power wise.

NOTE- My parents went off on a long road trip the other day and when I teased them about taking the Cruiser, cruising, I was told. &quot;No we took the van, it is more comfortable for long trips&quot;. (They also own a 1999 Ford Conversion Van that they purchased to pull their travel trailer) Go figure, my dad keeps telling me &quot;It's just a car.&quot; While it does have quite a few bells and whistles we will see if the Ford Thunderbird for next year will top this.

Sorry mom, I am going to have to rate your car a five star in the looks department and a three star in the driving department which averages to a four star overall. And I am sure in this case I will never be permitted to drive this car again.<br><br>
