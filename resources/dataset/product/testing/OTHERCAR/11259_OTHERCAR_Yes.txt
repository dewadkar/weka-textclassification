            I am very impressed with my 2001 Intrepid.  We have 11,000 miles on it now and have had absolutely no problems.  We have the smallest engine option (2.7 L) but it has adequate initial acceleration and very good passing acceleration.  I like the fact that the engine is only turning 2-2300 rpm at 65-70 mph.  Gas mileage is very good for such a large car.  The turning radius is smaller than both my previous cars,  despite them being mid-size cars.  The 4 wheel disc brakes are exceptional,  again out performing (by far) the mid-sized cars.  The only complaint I have been able to come up with is the stereo.  While it has very good sound quality,  the volume is a little low for when I am in a 'party mood.'  Also,  if you ever have the rear windows down while you are driving,  the noise in unbearable from the wind packing in the package deck area.  But overall this is a great car.  No regrets at all about buying it.
