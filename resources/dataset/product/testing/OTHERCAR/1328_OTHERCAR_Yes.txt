            The 2wd Silverado Ext. Cab is a great truck. It has numerous great qualities about it.  First the interior is great compared to previous models it is easy for passengers to get into the extened cab with the 4 door feature new on the 2000 models.  I have heard some people complain about the gas mileage but i have no complaints with my truck.  I modified the suspension using the bell tech lowering Kit 2 inch front 4 inch rear.  This is a great kit doesn't affect ride at all.  I also reprogramed the computer using the Hypertech power programmer, K&amp;N cold air induction kit, Flowmaster exhaust system (3 1/2 inch pipe with one two chamber flowmaster), 1 inch spacer plate behind throttle body and last but not least 125 horsepower dry kit from NOS (nitorus injector is mounted in air intake before the mass air censor). Truck ran 15.60 sec. @ 88 mph in 1/4 mile and ran 14.30 sec @ 96 mph in 1/4 mile on the nitrous.
Tire spin was a problem.  Also have 17/9.5 Centerline wheels with Nitto tires.  I am totally pleased with performance with this truck.  I also have a 20 foot Ranger Bass Boat which i pull with this truck and can't even tell its behind me.  The only problem i have with the truck is the factory Stereo system.  Replace factory deck with Sony CD player, Factory speaker were replace with infinity kappa mid's and hi's.  1 12 inch JL audio W3 woofer was installed underneath rear seat.<br><br>
