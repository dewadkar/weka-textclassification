                 I think that the brand new Hyundai Accent is a very excellent and reliable car for a great price. The Accent looks great; the styling is extremely appealing with its handsome grille. We own a Accent GS hatchback in Coastal Blue with a rear spoiler. It handles nicely and has great visibility. The ride is relatively smooth, also. But the best would most probably be the price. For about ten thousand dollars, you get a lot of bang for the buck. The standard feature on this car list to a whole lot of stuff. Some other cars have these as options, but Hyundai has made them as automatic basics. Also, the warranty is the best in the industry (along with daughter Kia), making it look great compared to other competitors, like the Chevy Metro and the Daewoo Lanos.
     There are, as with most cars, downsides to the Accent. First of all, the engine is pretty small; only a 1.5 Liter which produces only 92 horsepower. It is average in this class ( the Lanos has 105 and Metro has about 53), but still, it could be increased. Wind noise can also be a problem. It gets somewhat noisy at high speeds, but not enough to break the cars good sides. The last problem is the wheel covers. They are practically plastic on the tires. Hyundai should fix this by adding some nice rims to the car.
     This car is definitely wonderful. I would definitely not only recommend this car to college students or those on a budget, but to anyone who could use great transportation for a low price that is also backed up by the Hyundai Advantage Warranty. Great job Hyundai on an excellent car.
