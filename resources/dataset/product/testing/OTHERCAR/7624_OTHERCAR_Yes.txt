                 First off let me tell you something about me... I am a 16 year old male who is into some of the more extreme sports of life. We bought this SUV brand new in 1996 when I was 13 years old, and I'll be honest, I hated it. I thought it was just a mini-van disguised as a truck... oh and by the way... it isn't cool to go the paintball field in a minivan! 
     Well four years later I have grown to love this vehicle. When I turned 16, I recieved it as my first car, and it is my favorite car that we own (we also have a 1999 Pontiac Firebird, and a 1999 Chevy Suburban). My favorite thing about this truck (I hate the name SUV), is the fact that it is so versitile. It can haul all of my friends over to the movie theater, or it can take me to the paintball field. I am looking for lift kit right now so I can go off roading with my friends. It has so many uses, it's unbelievable. 
     In total the Jimmy can haul 6 people uncomfortably, or 5 comfortably. My only qualm with this vehicle is the back seat. There is enough room for your average teenager, but I have really long legs and they get crunched in the back. The front seat however, is very roomy and comfortable, and it rides extremely well on city streets. 
     I would definitly reccomend this car to anyone who wants a little adventure in their lives, and staying a little conservative at the same time... What ever you do though.... Only buy a 4WD, 4 door model... Without those key options, you won't have nearly as much fun!!!

             SOCCER MOMS BEWARE.... THIS IS NOT A MINIVAN!!!
