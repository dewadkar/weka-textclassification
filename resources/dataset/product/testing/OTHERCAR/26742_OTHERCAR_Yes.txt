            I purchased my Olympus D360L because I am novice in the digital photography arena; however, I have been involved in photography for years.  I did not want to spend more than $400.  It had features I was interested in without a big price tag.  With 1.3 megapixel, the camera takes quality photos for use in e-mails and web pages.  It also takes good photos for printing.  The camera is relatively easy to use.  I also like LCD screen for reviewing my photos.  The Macro feature was also appealing to me.   I use it quite often in more artistic types of photos.   
While I am pleased with camera itself, I am not pleased with the software.  It is limited to basic touch-ups.  I do use another program to give my photos touch-up, and change them to black and white.   
I would also recommend using an AC adapter as downloading takes some time.
The camera uses AA batteries, which can be depleted rather quickly.
