            I don't recommend this camera. I bought it for our family for Christmas and returned it after two weeks of using it.
I ended up buying the Canon S30 and am happy with it so far (although it is more difficult to use)

I was up and running with the Kodak 4330 in just a few minutes. Everything worked like a charm and was very intuitive. After installing the Kodak Easy Share software and connecting the USB port to the computer (when you buy your next computer, insist on USB connectors on the front!)
The download to the computer was very painless, and the editing software was pretty easy for basic touch-up. The camera seemed to produce a lot of red-eye so the red-eye removal tool in the easy share software was very handy.

We take mostly indoor pictures to capture moments with our family and daughter, and so most of our pictures use a flash. But every single photo we took has a noticeable "shadow" on the left of the subject! This was the deal breaker for us...the main reason I returned the camera.  I wonder if the flash is located too far right of the lens. I don't have this issue at all with the Canon S30 camera we have now. (thank you Staples for your generous return policy)

The photo-quality/resolution wasn't bad in my opinion but my wife claims that at the highest resolution setting ("Best"), she could see effects of pixelation on the 4x6 prints we made and was not willing to put them in her photo book (I couldn't see them). We had photos done on our photo printer and with one of the commercial photo machines at Kits Camera. The photos do look "funny", almost fake, but I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong. I think I'm distracted by the annoying shadow! (They had other 3MP photos that were printed there that were much better quality)

The 16MB of built in internal memory is nice since you always have backup memory with you. This is assuming you've purchased an additional high capacity SD memory card. 

The manual indicated that we could hold something like 16 pictures at the "Best" quality setting. I consistantly held 25 pictures at "Best". This was the quantity indicated for the middle ("Better?") range. Hmmm. I wondered if there was something wrong with this camera. 

The lens cap leaves a lot to be desired! This cheap little plastic cap attaches to the camera by a short tether. It sort of "sticks" on the lens as long as you don't touch it, i.e. don't put it in your pocket or a camera bag, it will fall off immediately. Luckily the lens is recessed when off, but you'll inevitably grab for the camera and stick you finger on the lens... guaranteed!! How disappointing.

Good job on allowing use of AA batteries instead of some expensive proprietary type. And they last quite a while too.

The software was intuitive and easily let you email photos with auto size-reduction appropriate for email. But I was frustrated that it didn't have a method to reduce pictures and save them do disk under a different name for uploading to a family website.

I wouldn't bother with the optional $79 Camera Dock that the salesperson will try to sell you. You can do everything it claims to do without the Dock. Share works right from the camera and the download to the computer is just a matter of plugging in the USB cable directly to the camera. The only reason to consider the dock would be that it comes with a rechargeable battery and charger, but with long lasting AA-batteries... why bother.
