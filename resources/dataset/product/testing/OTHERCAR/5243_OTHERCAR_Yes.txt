            I travel for a living, at times tallying up more than 50,000 miles per year.  Because of the need for vehicle stability and endurance, and also the need for comfort and ride, I have always selected luxury or near luxury vehicles.

In 1992 I purchased a Diamante LS new.  I loved the styling and performance right from the start.  As I continued to drive the vehicle my love affair was continually justified.  It is an awesome vehicle that required no maintenance, other than normal service and interval tune-ups, and it was therefore a very inexpensive vehicle to maintain.

At six thousand miles, the service center suggested rotating and balancing the tires.  I did so, but noticed a slight &quot;hum&quot; after the service.  I requested that the wheels be replaced in their original positions, and continued to drive the vehicle on the same tires, without rotation, for over 90,000 miles.  These were the original Michelin tires which came on the car, and when removed, still had enough wear on them to perform for an additional 20,000 or more.  That speaks highly not only of the tires, but of the integrity and durability of the front end.

The only drawback that I found with the car, was the lack of headroom for taller drivers.  You must duck your head severely while entering the car, and the head remains very close to the top edge of the windshield while driving.

I retired the car at 100,000 miles, after driving it slightly more than two years.  I couldn't stand to trade it, when trade-in quotes did not adequately compensate for the worth of the vehicle.  It remains in our family, and is still going strong.

I currently drive a Mercedes E320, but I consider the Diamante to be one of the finest vehicles on the road, and certainly a bargain, compared to others in the field.<br><br>
