            At last Infiniti wisened-up and decided to make this thing different than the Maxima! I just purchased a 2001 I30t, and the car receives comments all the time because I30s are so rare around here. Good acceleration (especially in the 3000 RPM range), roomy (nice) interior (which is great for me 'cause I'm 6'2"), nice exterior looks (especially with the Touring Sport package and fogged-out Xenon headlights... The list goes on for a while.

Yes, the 2001 I30 does share many similarities with the Maxima, but nowhere near as many as the previous generation did, and no more than the ES300/Camry and AcuraTL/HondaAccord. Platform sharing is par for the course in this class.

These things aren't advertised a whole lot, but one thing my fiancee and I liked about the experience was the dealer. He was very nice, and willing to negotiate. We met up with a lot of attitude at the local BMW dealer, which we did not appreciate.

Even compared to the other cars in its class (Lexus ES300 looks boring and is beginning to show signs of its age, Acura TL is boring and doesn't have enough rear leg-room, Lincoln LS V6 is... a Lincoln) you really can't beat this one.
