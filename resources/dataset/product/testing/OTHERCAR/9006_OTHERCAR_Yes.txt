                   The subcompact sport utility segment of the SUV market is fast becoming one of the most  popular segments in the auto industry. So, for consumers the question is &quot; which is the best?&quot;  If price, true four wheel off road capability and and durability are the critical factors for you, the answer is simple-the 2000 Kia Sportage 4 Door 4X4. This vehicle is no pretender, it's keeping it real by walking the talk everywhere from Paris-Dakar to the Laughlin SCORE series and the Baja 1000. It's true full length chassis and ladder box frame coupled with double wishbone, coil over suspension make it bomb proof off road and remarkably smooth and stable on road ( it's on road manners a aided by a wide stance relative to it's height ).  
       On the inside, it's roomier than an Izuzu Amigo or a GEO/Suzuki. It has tons of head room and leg room. The plastics are solid and not at all cheap looking and the fit and finish are excellent. The price is great to boot. At  right around $17,000.00 it's a steal. But get this, right now Kia has $2300.00 dollar rebates on the 2000s! That's right, so you can make out like crazy on a super vehicle. 
         Oh, did I mention the warranty? How about 10/100000 miles powertrain, 5/60000 bumper to bumper, anti-perforation, roadside assistance, safety restraints, towing and travel protection! And this is the free warranty!!! All this on the base model. Along of course with a full size spare,power mirrors, door locks and windows and a car alarm....
         What don't I like? Let me think..... the fact that I didn't buy one sooner!!!! This is a great vehicle from a great company that even has a finance division. You can configure the vehicle exactly as you please, thanks to Kia's policy of allowing you to purchase features individually instead of requiring purchase of a &quot; package&quot;. This is a great, bullet-proof tank of a sub 4X4 and this is the best time to buy a 2000. So, if it were me, I'd shut off the computer, run on down to the nearest Kia dealer and beg them to sell me one of the few remaining 4X4 4 door Sportages. Oh, wait, I already did that!
