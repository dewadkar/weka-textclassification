            I never thought I would own a foreign automobile. My wife pushed me to look at Nissans because of the wonderful success she had with her 200SX (250,000+ miles!).

I am very impressed by my SE model. I was looking for a car that was sporty, yet classy for taking clients to dinner.  The Altima is definitely that! I own a 1995 SE with leather seats and a five speed stick. This car has definite &quot;get-up-and-go&quot; power, especially in the stick model. Very well built car. I tried to disassemble the dash to install an alarm system. Man, is that thing put together strong! Layer upon layer rather than cheap, thin plastic.

Plenty of room too. I can easily fit five people very comfortably and six people if necessary. The controls are well positioned for the driver to maintain maximum eye-to-road contact.

Positives

Handles very well
Works good with performance tires (I use Goodyear Eagles)
Looks classy and sporty
Power sunroof can slide back or pop up
HUGE TRUNK
plenty of foot room front and back
good gas mileage
comfortable for long rides (trust me!)
over 100,000 miles and no major engine problems besides normal wear
integrity of vehicle (after five years, no weird squeeks or rattles)

Negatives

1996 was first year back seat folded down. '95 only has pass through
Road noise is a bit high. Mostly from side view mirrors (improved in newer 
   models)
Paint on my '95 is not clear coat ( i have been told). Also changed in newer models
Nissan logo that covers keyhole on trunk broke. Expensive to replace

This car is a great value for its price. Regular maintenance should give you many years and miles of use.<br><br>
