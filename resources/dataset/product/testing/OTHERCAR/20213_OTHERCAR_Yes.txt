            I have been very pleased with my purchase of a new Malibu.  I now have 8,000 miles and have had no problems whatsoever.  The car provides all the value and performance that Chevrolet claimed.  I have friends with Camry's and Accord's, and I find the Malibu to compare to them very favorably.  And the price is less for a Malibu.  I strongly recommend that one use the GM credit card as well and accumulate rebate dollars.  I had collected $6,000 over the last seven years, and thus this car was bought for about $11,000.  I recommend the LS model, as its features are better and worth the price.

The only negative I have experienced to date is that I find it somewhat challenging for a tall person to get in and out of the vehicle.  I am 6'5&quot;.  However, once I am in the vehicle, I am comfortable enough.<br><br>
