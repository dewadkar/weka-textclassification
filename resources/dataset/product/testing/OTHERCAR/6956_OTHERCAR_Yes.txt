            I bought a Blazer because my company participated in the GM supplier discount program.  That, coupled with the fact that I had approx. $2000 in GM card earnings, pointed me towards a GM.  I was interested in the SUV's, so the Blazer was a good fit.  Since purchasing the vehicle, I have found that it has become almost a necessary part of my lifestyle.  It basically rides like a car - smooth and easy, but it provides enough room to carry a group of friends skiing, bring home a new piece of furniture, or load up the top with luggage!  I am very pleased, and plan to keep it for years to come!  (Good roominess for a carseat in the back too!) <br><br>
