            If you're looking for a luxurious automobile at a comfortable price, then the 2000 Daewoo Leganza certainly is a wise buy.  For roughly $15000, my wife got her Leganza, loaded with toys.

How can one pass up this vehicle? It's got the air for the hot summer days, cranks heat in the winter and has a sunroof to allow one to bask in the breeze.

You could sleep in the seats, the stereo has a phenomenal sound and the car is just plain fun to drive. This car even handles rough railroad trucks with ease. Now that is style.

The Leganza offers plenty of trunk space for travel fanatics, power windows, doors, antenna, cup holders and for the backseat passengers a nice, comfy arm rest in the middle. 

Who could ask for more? This is the greatest car I've been in yet besides a Mitsubishi. Pick out your Daewoo today. According to the grapevine, Ford is buying the company. Wouldn't it be great to snag a Daewoo before the &quot;car today, junk tomorrow&quot; company jacks up the price unnecessarily high? I would think so!
