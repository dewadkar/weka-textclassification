            My family bought a corolla because my father commutes to work, and so good mileage was a major concern.  Our corolla has met the challenge and then some!  Dad drives 90 miles a day about, and our '91 corolla now has 309,000 miles on it because of it (plus a cross country road trip we took in it summer of '97 racked up some miles!)  We have at the car's best gotten 45 miles to the gallon doing highway driving!  On average it gets 25 to the gallon in the city and 30/35 highway--still great!  

Through all of this driving my dad has only had to make routine repairs--oil changes regularly, tire alignment, timing belt once in a blue moon.  The engine of the car will probably last forever it seems, however after nine years of use of course the plastic parts on the interior (air conditioning vents, steering wheel plastic) are starting to wear.  

It is an amazing car to me--but you have to accept its limitations.  It is to cramped if you want to take it on a trip, and sometimes its V4 engine makes merging onto the freeway a little treacherous--it could use some more pick up.  

However economically the corolla is perfect--it is a quality machine that will last a lot longer than any ford product, with half as many repairs.  And of course don't forget the sticker price continues to be great--i think they go for 13 or 14 thousand--amazing!  I highly recommend the corolla, however even though it is an excellent product, it unfortunately is not big enough for a family.  

I am glad I have been able to share about our amazing corolla--its longevity is a true testament to the quality of toyota cars. <br><br>
