<b> The Performance:</b>

This 850GLT is a Turbo-Lite 5 cylinder type vehicle.  It goes!  Just a tap on the gas and I'm in the next town.  When my brother-in-law sold me this car, (he traded up to a Lexus, the snob!) he was so excited to tell me that I would always be &quot;first off the line&quot;.  He was right-o!  The ride is comfortable, powerful and smooth.  A luxury cruiser with sporty feel.  After driving a Saturn for five years, this car is a TREAT!

<b> Volvo Service: </b>
Superb.  What more can I say.  Whenever I have brought the car in for service, Volvo has always voluntarily made updates and taken care of recall items.  They are always courteous and prompt.

<b> The bad: </b>

Only a few minor items here. 

    * The passenger's seat reclines using a manual dial that is difficult to turn.
    * The remotes go out a lot
    * There is no complimentary car wash at my local dealer...they don't have the facilities for it.
    * The drink holder broke and it wasn't covered under warranty.  Not only that but they don't sell the small piece that broke off separately...200 smacks for a new complete drinkholder.
    * The antenna somehow got bent.  Again they wouldn't cover it under warranty.
    * Expensive to fill up at the pump.
    

<b>Conclusion:</b>
Overall, I would say this car is fantastic.  I love the way it drives and it looks cool too.  Big enough and practical for the kids that will come soon, but sporty enough for me.  I'd buy another in a heartbeat.
