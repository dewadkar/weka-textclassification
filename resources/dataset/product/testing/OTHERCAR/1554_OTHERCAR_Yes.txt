            When I started having children, I told myself I would not drive a mini van no matter how large my family grew. I associated mini vans with &quot;older&quot; people. So through the years I stuck with cars and even leased a Blazer for a couple of years.

What I found out was, these other vehicles were impractical for my growing family. I needed something that was big enough to haul my three kids around and of course their friends.

So my husband and I went shopping for a new vehicle back in 1998. I had a list in hand of the features and &quot;must haves&quot; this new vehicle was to come with.

Of course the first must, was reliability. Followed by safety, gas mileage, and size.

Believe it or not, we ended up looking at a used 1995 Dodge Caravan. The salesman was great and allowed me to drive this van for the rest of that day and most of the next.

I drove it all over town and out on the interstate. I fell in love immediately. It drove so smoothly and I felt so safe with the kids riding in the back seats.

It came with all of the features I had on my list, including driver side and passenger side air bags. It gets great gas mileage and is very reliable.

We bought it the next day. We have had it two years now and could not be happier. We have never had a problem with it. We take several roads trips each year, and it has never let us down.

The best part is.....I don't look so old driving a mini van after all!! LOL<br><br>
