            I bought my 1996 Corsica after trading in my 1990 Corsica.  I have no clue why I stayed with this model.  I hated the 90.  The alignment on the Corsica's is awful.  The brake lines also tend to go fast.  But on to my 96...it's a decent car.  It gets pretty good gas mileage.  I do 90% thruway driving, so I use a tank a week.  The acceleration is good.  The one thing I noticed though, is the seals on the doors are horrible.  Living in Buffalo is the truest winter-car test you can put a car through.  Anything under 30 degrees and my doors freeze and stick pretty bad.  I've also had problems with the windshield washer hoses freezing up pretty bad.  I did notice that the alignment on the newer model is a lot better then on the older one.  The interior of the car hasn't changed much.  I like the fold down seats in the back, great for when you go shopping and have some big packages to throw into the trunk.  The only thing I could wish for was power windows, but I've never had a real problem.  On the older model, the windows would freeze horribly and opening them would take running the car for a solid 10 minutes.  I'm a very basic car shopper.  I don't need all the thrills and glitz of fancy stereo components or auto/power everything.  But I do like the tilt wheel and cruise control options.  Not a bad car.  The backseats don't have a whole lot of room, especially if you're taller.  I think Corsica's make a great first car...just don't expect to keep it long after the warranty runs out unless you're rich, or you're married to a mechanic.<br><br>
