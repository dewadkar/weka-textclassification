            When I first thought of getting a digital camera, I just wanted something that was easy to use, had an LCD screen, and was within my budget so that I could stop having to scan the pictures that I wanted to upload to the Internet (which was quite time consuming). The LCD screen was a very important feature in a digital camera for me - in my opinion, it's the whole point of having a digital camera! You can see the picture you just took and choose whether or not you want to keep it.

I bought it at a good price, and as a bonus, instead of coming with a 2 MB card, it came with an 8 MB card, which stores more pictures. One of the things I liked about this camera is that it also looks and feels like a regular camera (with the exception of the extra buttons and the LCD screen on the back).

I was very excited when I brought this camera home. As soon as I popped the batteries in (it takes 4 AA batteries, another bonus since they're easy to find), and with a click of the button I already had my first picture!

Just a note - the batteries last longer when you only use the LCD screen for reviewing and deleting pictures. Just like a normal camera, this digital camera does have a peep hole through which to look when taking pictures. You <I>can</I> use the LCD screen to take pictures as well, but I find it much easier to do it the old fashioned way and to use the LCD screen to review the pictures you have taken.

What I really liked about this camera is that, even though the maximum size of pictures it takes is 640 x 480 mega pixels, you can set it to 3 different qualities of pictures at that size. I have taken most of my pictures at its highest quality setting, and they have all turned out very well. The main reason why I wanted the digital camera really was so that I didn't have to develop and scan pictures anymore for my homepage and to send through e-mails - it became a bit of a hassle. This camera perfectly suited my needs - I really didn't need any pictures bigger than the 640 x 480 max that it gives - in fact, I actually made them even smaller for posting them on the Internet. I wouldn't recommend enlarging the pictures, though; you will lose their clarity. It also takes pictures at the 320 x 160 mega pixel size, which is a perfect size for e-mailing images.

The software that came with the camera is also very easy to install and use - no complicated technical lingo whatsoever. It's very colorful and has easy to use tabs. I use Adobe Photo Deluxe, but find that this program works best even with my scanner, and is the easiest to figure out. It also has some fun functions when it comes to manipulating images, and I have had quite a few laughs with some of the things you can do with your images. It is perfect for the beginner and amateur to start learning how to manipulate image files, as well as for someone who likes a hassle-free, easy to use program.

When it comes to downloading the pictures from the camera to the computer, it utilizes a serial cable which is also what I was looking for since I am still using Windows 95 and do not have a USB port on my computer. Yes, it takes a little longer, but an extra few minutes is well worth it with what this camera has provided for me, and is much less time consuming than scanning pictures.

The options that the camera itself gives are very useful. The menu is user-friendly, and there are many options, including different settings for the kind of picture you are taking (for example, a close-up of people, a picture of landscape, etc.). It also has the option of protecting pictures that you want to keep and don't want to accidentally delete, which comes in very handy when you start deleting pictures that you don't like in order to re-take them.

It also has a built-in flash, which works quite well for indoor pictures - both my outdoor and indoor pictures have always turned out well with this camera. Its red-eye reduction function with the flash comes in quite handy when you are taking pictures of people.

Overall, I love this camera and didn�t see the need to upgrade for a very long time� I have since upgraded only because I received a more elaborate and advanced digital camera as one of my Christmas presents this past year, but the need was really not there. This camera does everything that I needed it to do without any hassles or complications.

I definitely <I>highly</I> recommend this camera to someone who has never owned a digital camera before and doesn�t want to spend more than $200 on one, or even to just about anyone wanting to get a digital camera under $500 and doesn't mind that it doesn't take pictures larger than 640 x 480 mega pixels.
