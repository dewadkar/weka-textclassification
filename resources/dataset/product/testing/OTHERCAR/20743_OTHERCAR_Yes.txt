            I love the Chevy Blazer.  My best friend owns the 1998 and I think that it is the best SUV that I have ever driven.  It's a very reliable vehicle that does not have mechanical problems.  His Blazer just reached 70,000 miles and it is a 1998, that should tell you something.  We just changed the tires and the brakes for the first time since he got it. It is very low maintenance.
It is a very comfortable and smooth ride that provides for an enjoyable time in the car.  It is a very good vehicle for families and anyone who likes power and safety all in the same vehicle.  If you do a lot of driving and want good gas mileage for an SUV this one has it all.
Most importantly it is VERY pretty to look at and does not cost too much.<br><br>
