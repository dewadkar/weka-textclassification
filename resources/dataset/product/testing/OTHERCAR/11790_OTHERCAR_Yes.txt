            I bought a Casio EXILIM EX-M2 for my wife and do not regret my choice.  She is a casual photographer and her needs are simple: 6x4" maximum size.  Why the M2?

1) Size: The smaller it is, the more she will use it because it is easy to carry in a pocket or a purse.  She had a bigger digital camera and did not use as much and thus lost those precious Kodak moments.  Suffice to say that I just sold it on eBay.

2) Digital: She can easily transfer the pictures to her computer and send it away by email.  She had a normal 35mm and APS camera and a scanner.  Suffice to say that the scanner is collecting dust as I write.  Her family and friends do not share the good moments captured in film.

3) 2MP: Why pay for bigger CCD when 2MP is good enough for 6x4" prints?  Of course not exactly photo-quality (300dpi) but close enough for casual users.

4) MP3 player: Those endless hours stuck in traffic jam and subways, what better than listening to music?  Why buy a nifty iPod to match her computer when the EX-M2 does the same job.  Sure it doesn�t have the 20GB storage but then that would be asking for too much on such a small device.

5) Audio recorder: I have heard hundred of times my wife say "Come quick!  Listen to your baby daughter talk!  I wish we could record this and send it to my parents...".  Maybe you want to record a secret confession from your friends.  This is a very very useful tool for anyone.

6) Fixed-focus: No zoom means no time gap between pressing the shutter button and actually taking the picture.  It is almost instant!  Casual pictures usually means short distance to the subject.  One can artificially zoom in by getting closer.  Any how, the digital zoom is there for those really needy situations.

Let me finish with some CONS. Casio came out with a new EXILIM camera-only device, the EX-S3 with a 3MP CCD, real-time histogram, a huge 2" LCD display, lens cover, better joystick control, and lots of photographic functions for similar price than the EX-M2.  Bang for the buck, M2 wins hands down.  But if the EX-M3 comes out for around $350, that�ll be a dream come true because most of the M2 flaws are corrected.

I am not a real Casio fan, but this device is truly a marvelous piece for the non-serious photographers.
