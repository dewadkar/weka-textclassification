            Hi, I'm Peter and I am a car enthusiast. I have read about this car and driven it a lot despite the fact that I still don't own one. What is great about this car is that it is the most reliable car on the road in my opinion. Mercedes has always been known as a reliable car company but they took it a step further when they created this sleek new E-class. Another great aspect about this car is that it is also safe. It has the side airbags and head curtains for added safety. When I was looking into the cars in this price range, I was stuck between getting the BMW 5 series and this E-class. I really liked the power and luxury of the BMW but I also liked how the Mercedes drove. Each of these cars are excellent but what struck me to be strange was how much more spartan the Mercedes was than the BMW. I could easily tell that Mercedes put all of their energy into making this car from the engine and body out, while the BMW focused more on the interior comfort. I know that when you go yo look at this car, you will see the $40,000+ price tag and think that it is too expensive. Don't, whatever you do, look at this car as just a car. This is an investment. What I suggest to do is to get the most out of this car. If you opt for an E-300 (was not made in 2000 but will be back in 2001 or 2002) you will get a much better value. This car will last as long as you. You can buy it when you are 16 and drive it when you're 50. Just think of how many times you would have to buy a new car if you consistently bought a ford focus. Also, this car with the deisel engine has a great gas mileage. For these reasons, get an E-300 diesel and save money on your next car.<br><br>
