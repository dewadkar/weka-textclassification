            We needed a digital camera at work and since I owned my own (a Ricoh RD-4300) I was elected to choose own for the office. We use the camera to document failures or wear of our products so we needed to be able to document hairline cracks and other tiny imperfections. The RD-5300's super macro performed this task beautifully. The camera performs outdoor shots excellent. Indoor shots require careful positioning of lights but that's because we are taking pictures of metal products that are shiny so we can't use the flash. Other indoor photos with the flash are of above average quality. The camera is used by many novices and no one has complained that the camera was too hard to operate. Battery life is horrible when using the lcd display, if not battery life moves up to average. Our camera came with the remote control which is real nice taking close-ups so as not to bump the camera.
