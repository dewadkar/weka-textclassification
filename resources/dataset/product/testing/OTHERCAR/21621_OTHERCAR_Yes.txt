            I absolutely love my Grand Cherokee.

We bought ours used, so I was pretty leary at first.  The owner let me drive the vehicle for several days to decide if I wanted it or not. Well, it is obvious what happened... I was hooked and decided to purchase it.

I like the way it handles, the comfortable seats, how much room it has, the flexibility of the back seats (up or down and in 3 easy steps), the gas mileage (GREAT!  20MPG) among other features.

The steering is tight.  It does not squeak.  You don't feel every bump on the road.  The seats are comfortable, even on long trips.

OK.  Now the drawbacks:  The airconditioning can be a problem.  But I have discovered that this is true of Jeep Cherokees.  It is working now (and cross my fingers will continue to work).  The only other problem is one that is repairable at a small cost.  When you buy a used vehicle, you just don't know what problems you might buy with it... That is a chance we take. 

Other than those 2 problems, I would highly recommend the vehicle!<br><br>
