            Yes, the Villager is smaller than most minivans.  But there's one thing that is often overlooked-it's a MINIVAN!  If you want something bigger, buy a full-size van.  This thing fits in the smaller-than-average-size garage (mine).

The ride is limo-smooth.  Power from the NISSAN engine (not Ford) is well-matched to the NISSAN transmission (not Ford) and super quiet.  Put your foot in it, and it gets with the program in a hurry!

When considering a minivan, we asked ourselves "will this thing last 100,000 miles.  For any of the domestics (besides the Villager), the answer was no.  But having a Nissan powertrain and our previous experience with Nissans, the choice was obvious.  The 2.9% financing cinched the deal.

Inside the van are front/rear air which will freeze you in short order.  Plenty of other amenities (storage nooks, plenty of floor mats to cover everything, removeable seats, great luggage capacity with all seats in, great standard stereo even without the CD).  And an available SUNROOF-something seemingly unheard of in the domestic brands (why?).  The only complaint-no standard CD player-a cassette player is no longer selling point like was in the 70s.
