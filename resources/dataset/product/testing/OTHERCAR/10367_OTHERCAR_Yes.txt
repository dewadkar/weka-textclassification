            I was  Nissan owner for 5 years prior to getting my Kia.  My Credit was not that good and when i went to a dealership to trade in my Nissan(my lease was up) the salesperson said I was qualified for this car.  The first ride I had in a Sephia, was a base model and I was not going to fget that one at all.  ANyways, I purchased a red sephia Ls. 

The interior did look a little cheap and I thought a Tach would have been nice with a stick car.  It is now 2 years since I have had my car and I do like it.  I have not had any MAJOR mechanical problems with it.  I have had to get the A/C fixed/warranty and shift assy, moulding, lug nuts(twice) Emergency brake and there were 2 recalls.  All of these repairs were fixed under warranty and the dealers I went to were top notch.  Im only at 36,200 miles and I do need front breaks.  I do think this is too soon for that, but that is a major item.  Had no problem in the winter and the car has startedall of the time.

I would recommend a Sephia to anyone who wants an inexpensive car that is good transportation, but don't expect the quality of a Honda.  I wuld buy another Kia though and I am in fact trying to purchase a Sportage.<br><br>
