             My first new car was a 1994 Nissan Sentra XE. I'm what you would call &quot;low maintenance&quot; when it comes to automobiles, and this car has really held up! Much like a Toyota, all you really have to do with this car is keep oil, gas and water in it. At 100,000 miles, my Sentra has been all over the country, usually in need of an oil change, but has yet to break down on me(knock on wood). What I'm most excited about, however, is not the great gas mileage, or the abuse the powertrain can withstand, but the strength of the frame and body of this car. 
   When I originally purchased this car, my parents were concerned about me being a young, unexperienced driver behind the wheel of a compact car. They tried to push me into a truck or &quot;land yacht&quot; for impact safety reasons. Well, I can tell you from firsthand experience, i honestly believe that this car may be darn close to a Volvo, as far as impact resistance goes. Example 1: 1999 hurricane, my car was crushed front-to-back, dead center by a fallen tree, appx. 25ft. high, and 3 1/2 feet in circumference. The insurance company said that it was a total loss, because the roof and windshield frames &quot;would not be able to be reshaped&quot;. My car was easily repairable for $1200.00, more than half of that price being the cost of the glass. Example 2: Two months after returning my car to the road after the &quot;tree incident&quot;, I was at a dead stop at a light, when I was rearended by another compact car going 50mph. The other car was totaled and undriveable...my damage, broken taillights, scarred bumper, dented trunk. NO FRAME DAMAGE!
 So, in conclusion, for my original purchase price of $11,500 brand new, I most certainly recommend the Nissan Sentra to anyone who travels a lot, is prone to accidents (or bad luck, as is my case), or is lazy about routine maintenance (me, again..hehehe).<br><br>
