            With 2 kids, my wife was really wanting to trade our 1999 Altima for a minivan.  After owning an early '80s American car, reliability is a big factor for me.  After searching reliability, our choices were down to the Toyota Sienna, the Honda Odyssey, and The Mazda MPV.  

I thought the Toyota was ugly, and the interior was not versatile enough (no flip down 3rd row, no sliding 2nd row, etc.)

The local Honda dealer wouldn't even let us test drive an Odyssey.  Their attitude was "pay us MSRP plus $1500 in dealer options, and we'll give you a call when one comes in.  You want certain options?  Forget it!"  It also looked like the Honda would be a tight fit in the garage.

I qualify at work for the Mazda S plan which gets me a Mazda for below invoice (the local dealer will sell close to that anyway), and we really liked the MPV after test driving one for half an hour.  I also liked that the van wasn't too big for us, it was the "right" size.  The engine has great pull, and it drives well enough that you ALMOST forget you are in a van.  One of the few things I don't like is that the cruise control seems to be a little quirky.  It will downshift just before it gets back to the setpoint and it is not as responsive as the one I had on the 3 Nissans I have had.

After buying it, we love it.  The kids love the extra room, and there is plenty of space for stuff on trips.  Given the choice, I'd buy it again with no reservations.
