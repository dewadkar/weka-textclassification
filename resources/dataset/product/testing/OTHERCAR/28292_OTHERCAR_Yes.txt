            I was looking for an SUV for my family.  We looked at several and we bought the Durango because it has alot more room than most other SUV's.  The features I really like are, of course, the stereo, the rear air conditioning unit and the third seat.  All the controls are very accessible to the driver and front seat passenger.  Controls on the steering column for the stereo is also great.  I have found that it is a very smooth and quiet ride.  The gas mileage is not too good but overall I would definitly buy this vehicle again.  If you have trouble getting in and out of vehicles, I would not advise getting a Durango because they are taller than a regular car.<br><br>
