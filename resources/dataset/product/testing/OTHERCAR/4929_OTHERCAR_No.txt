            I was in search of a new truck. This search led me to the Tundra. However, the short dealer test drive left me cold, so I "rented" my neighbors new 4x4 for a week. It was as I say, a car without a trunk lid. It's pretty, mid-sized and handles well when empty. The lousy gas mileage is not so much due to the weight of the vehicle as it is to the gearing of the vehicle. A 5 speed automatic is definitely needed for this vehicle. After a couple of days of "empty" driving I decided to load it up and see what happens. With 4 people and no payload it drives like a car with 4 people in it, I wouldn't want to get into a panic situation with 4 people in it. Ok, now 2 people and a 1000 pound payload, nope, still too unstable for me and the biggest scary problem is the brakes... $33,000 plus and they use 100 year old braking technology.... rear DRUM brakes! With the aforementioned payload, everyday stopping is panic stopping. I just can't believe that anyone who owns this vehicle for a truck is using it for a truck. The other thing that caused discomfort is the short seats, that is , the fact that the seat cushions do not support the whole upper leg, which causes leg pain in an hour or so of driving.
I returned it to my neighbor, smiled and said "Great truck" so as to not hurt her feelings.
