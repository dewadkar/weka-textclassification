            We were drawn to this particular vehicle because of its size, color and the fact that it was fully loaded!  We have three dogs, so, there is plenty of room in the back for them and also, lots of room for my sister and her family, which includes a car seat.  

This is my first sports utility and my daughter and I love it!  My sister and I have to buy everything monthly.  That includes household goods and groceries for both of us.  When I had my car, there was never enough room for all her monthly things, let alone mine.  So, I had to make several trips to the stores.  But, with this vehicle, I can get everything all in one trip!

It rides very smooth.  I bought it used.  It's a 1997.  It had a few things wrong with it that the dealer never told me about, but I would never go back to a car.  

It doesn't do too well in town for gas, but it fares pretty well on the interstate. The major thing that I don't like, is the price it costs when you do have to fix something.  But, I would still never go back to driving a car.<br><br>
