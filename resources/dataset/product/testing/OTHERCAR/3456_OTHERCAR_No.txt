            In my conquest for a lower cost alternative to BMW 330 I decided to take a look at Acura CL Type S. Here's what I found.

The interior is very bland and "uninspiring" :) There are Honda Accord parts everywhere! In fact, there are only three distinct differences - transmission shifter, cup holder cover, and fake wood door panels. That's pretty much it! However, being a blood brother to Honda Accord Coupe is not really a very bad thing. Overall, the interior is nice and has a certain charm to it.

This car has a pretty powerful engine, but it generates torque steer that�s even more powerful. The front of the car wobbles if you floor it real hard. It feels like the front tires are made of jell-o. But you can probably get used to it. The really big problem occurs when you decide to make a hard turn and accelerate at the same time. I tried that and almost lost control of the car, but again, this is not the end of the world � people can learn to live with that. And of course there�s an upside to having a 260 HP engine in a 3,500 lbs car. This engine pulls hard and acceleration is a very good 0-60 time (just under 7 seconds). But compare this time to the similarly powered BMW 330 and Audi S4 and you�ll see that CL-S doesn�t even come close. The drivetrain obviously lacks refinement. The exhaust note is identical to Honda Accord�s, but it seemed a bit louder (probably because of higher "redline").

Acura has excellent braking, but there was a significant �dive�. Highway driving was a breeze. The steering was direct and it felt like the car is on the rail track. However in the parking lot I was very surprised by the wide turning radius of the car � I missed the parking spot by a mile.

But the biggest problem I have with this car is its sound system. Luxury cars can�t have only 4 speakers and a sub. It just doesn�t work this way! But at least the sound was stable and had no noticeable distortions at reasonable volume levels.

I know that people praise Japanese carmakers for their ergonomics, but this was truly not the case with Acura�s radio controls. There was just a bunch of small buttons thrown on the radio panel with no clear markings on them. The most often used buttons - �track skip� - were in the lowest and farthest possible area of the radio controls :). I just don�t know why... I did like the Air Conditioning controls � very simple and convenient dials, just like in Honda Accord.

The seats are the best part of the car. Firm lateral support and very soft bottom and back � simply perfect. However, I couldn�t fit comfortably in the driver�s seat. The dealer actually complained that Acura wouldn�t make the sunroof optional, because a lot of people don�t fit and it takes about two inches off the headroom. I couldn�t agree more!

Well, Acura CL-S does not appear to be a viable alternative to BMW 330, MB C320, or Audi S4. It�s just a very different type of car. It does cost very little money, but if you think about it for a second - Honda Accord Coupe costs even less.
