            I need to state up front that this is my first digital camera so I don't have any personal experience with digital cameras to compare it against. 

The camera does take good quality pictures, 2.2 mega pixels is plenty for the average home use photography. I've taken the memory card to Costco and had pictures developed on standard photographic paper and would be hard pressed to distinguish them from photos take with my old 35mm camera. 

One particularly aggravating feature for me is the camera&#146s lack of secondary memory that retains settings when the regular batteries are being changed. To make the batteries last longer I always turn the LCD off and use the viewfinder, it's not difficult to change but takes a minute or two. Every time you change batteries it defaults back to the factory settings. 

The second aggravating feature, again not huge, is that the lens cap will not stay on. It has a connector strap so it doesn't get lost but it refuses to stay on. My wife has added some pieces of tape on the inside of the lens cap to reduce the ID which helps a little but it still does not work as any proper lens cap should. 

The bundled software does work well and is reasonably intuitive, I have not spent much time studying the book and am able to use it effectively. 

The camera is not as intuitively designed, I still need to get the book out occasionally to understand some of the settings, not terrible but could be easier.
