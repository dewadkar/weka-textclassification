            I own a 1998 TJ Sahara Jeep wrangler. This past year, I have been getting a lot of flack on doing something with my Jeep by my friends!  So I decided to put on a lift and bigger tires.  Well, today I did it!!  A couple of friends and I put on a 2&quot; Rubicon Express lift with the Sway bar quick disconnects.  All the lift consisted of was: 4 2&quot; coil spacers, 4 shocks with longer travel.  And the Sway Bar quick disconnects came in a bunch of pieces.  But, an average mechanic could figure it out.  We started around 10am and finished around 1pm.  There was nothing to complicated about the whole set-up, but the instructions that came from Rubicon Express were not the best to explain what to do.  You could do it, but with some help by a mechanic.  The instructions had no diagram, just words that were not the best to show a mental image of what it was suppose to look like.  But, all in all it wasn't that bad!  I am really happy with the lift and the quick disconnects really show a difference with the articulation in the front.  I am now working on a way to have the back disconnect like the front does (not enough movement for me).  If there is any question that you have about this or other &quot;Cool&quot; things about Jeeps.  Just let me know!!  ashort.rochester.rr.com<br><br>
