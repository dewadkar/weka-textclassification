            I have wanted a Jeep ever sence I can remember. When I was 16 years old I got what I wanted! It was a 1995 Jeep Wrangler Rio Grande, it was only a 4  cylinder but I fell in love. 

Pros:

Very efficient when going on trips off road such as camping, hunting, fishing, going to the beach, or just riding.

For those who love to drive a standard, this is the vehicle for them.  This comes equipped with a standard, or can be bought as an automatic.

The vehicle has an optional (you choose) 4-wheel drive, generally it is left in 2-wheel drive.

The torque of the vehicle when it is in 4-wheel drive mode is unbelievable.  It pulls an awesome amount with what seems to be very little effort involved.  

Cons:

Gas Mileage:  The gas mileage is favorable, as long as you leave the stock equipment on it.  I changed the tires on my Jeep, and the gas mileage went down.

Ride:  The ride is very bumpy, which means that the Jeep is equipped mainly for off-road aggressive nature.

Road-noise:  The noise of the vehicle while moving at higher speed is very noticeable in this vehicle.  The vehicle is also very un-aerodynamic in styling, but is still appealing to the eyes. <br><br>
