            1999 Dodge Durango
We give it 5*****


This vehicle is probably the best all around vehicle I have ever owned or driven.  The Dodge Durango has it all, room, power, looks and performance.  We needed a vehicle that would get us through the Michigan winters and have the room we needed for our one year old son.  We are able to get through the worst weather, proven by our trip to Grand Forks North Dakota on January 3, 1999.  The challenge of that blizzard was met and surpassed by our Durango.  We went through two to three feet of snow and braved the temperatures that were -50 degrees.  The purple beast started every day and never faltered even in the deepest of snow.  On the flip side of the winter is summer and with our third seat we are able to go to the beach or take family or friends out to eat with plenty of room to spare.  Even my six foot three inch father in law is able to sit in the third seat with ease.  The rear air conditioner is also a blessing for those who are in the back.  My wife enjoys the CD player and can enjoy it no matter where she sits.  She also enjoys the view from up front, she is able to see over most vehicles in front of her.  This is her first experience of driving a four wheel drive vehicle and she feels very safe no matter what the conditions.  

The only draw  back that we can see with the vehicle is that the gas mileage isn't the greatest.  Thirteen to sixteen at the best on a trip and twelve to fourteen around town. 

So if you want a vehicle that performs in any kind of weather, looks like its more than a truck and is just fun to drive then a Dodge Durango could be the vehicle for you.  <br><br>
