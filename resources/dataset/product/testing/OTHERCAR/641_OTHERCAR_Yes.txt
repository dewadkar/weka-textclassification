            We bought this camera knowing that for about 589.00 it wasn't the best camera out there. However, we were surprised. I have never seen a 2 megapixel camera that creates pictures as well as the 950.  "Bigger, better, faster, smarter..." There are so many enhancements bundled into the CoolPix 950 that it's hard to know where to begin describing them!  

Photos are simple to upload to your computer. You can quickly pull up your photos and decide which ones to keep. Believe it or not I did not even read the users manual until a few times after using it. The quality of this camera is awesome. This camera has a metal casing (magnesium) and should hold up for years to come. 

As I stated above it features a 2.1 megapixel, 1/2-inch CCD sensor, producing images up to 1600x1200 pixels in size. Three image sizes is supported, with three different compression levels available for each, and an additional, uncompressed storage mode at the highest resolution.

 The right side of the camera has a hand grip and Command Dial on the front panel; a shutter release surrounded by the Power/Mode dial, small LED data display, Flash/ISO control, and Normal/Macro/Self-timer button on top; an LCD monitor on the back; and a battery compartment and CompactFlash slot accessible through the bottom of the camera, next to the built-in tripod mount. Arranged around the LCD are the Monitor on/off button, Menu on/off button, Up and Down Arrow buttons, and three buttons under the LCD that serve as the heart of the control system, performing various functions, based on the Mode and Command Dial settings. The left side of the camera houses the lens, built-in flash, off-camera flash synch connector, optical viewfinder, and flash/autofocus LED indicator lights next to the viewfinder. 

The LCD display screen is quite sharp, due to its 130,000 pixels of resolution. I will however say that the LCD is quite hard to see in bright sunlight. In sunny settings, you will want to rely on the optical viewfinder instead. One of the features I liked about the '950 was the amount of information it gave about the camera status and current picture-taking settings, via the LCD display. On the down side, this is a little tough on the battery. Speaking of batteries I highly suggest that you get rechargeable high-output batteries. These will last 10 times longer then the ones that come with this camera.
