            This is not a high performance drivers car, it drives you. However, for long trips, it is excellent. I travel long distances in my work, and at the end of the trip, I am not tired out. The passing power on the highway is good, it is extremely stable and handles well in snow and rain.  The sound system is excellent.  The car is extremely quiet and has a very smooth ride, although you can feel the road and it does not "float". I have 45,000 miles on it and it is still very "tight".  The gas mileage is good for the size of car. At about 65mph I get about 34 mpg. As with GM cars, the parts are cheaper. The only concern that I have about it is that I have been told that the brakes need frequent changing. As well, my dealership grossly overcharges for any ongoing maintenance such as oil changes, trying to pad the bill with things that are not really needed.
