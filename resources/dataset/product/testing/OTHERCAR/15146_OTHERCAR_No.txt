            If you love the feel of a sporty car yet 4 cylinder....the Grand Am can be the car. But that is where the delight in it ends. My 1996 Grand Am spent as much time at the dealership as it did being driven. I had 5 unpleasant experiences of being stranded w/ broken alternator belts in a year and a half. Each time at night on a holiday.....the grand am guardian obviously took holidays off. My favorite break down was the first weekend of moving to this town...my Grand Am decided to lose all power driving down the interstate 65 miles an hour. The entire electrical system is gone. It coasts for 6 miles and then is dead. Of course on a weekend after any service dept is closed...and 98 degree heat...with 2 kids in the car!! After towing it and then spending $40 on a cab home...it is the alternator dead AGAIN! Second one in a year. Let's say my faith in this car flushed down the toilet for the final time at that point. When the car was working..the comfort of the car was fine and it sits very comfortably. But personally comfort takes the back seat to dependability. When the service man at the dealership comments &quot;again?&quot; on the 3rd, 4th and 5th belt break...time to trade cars. The mechanic commented on the 3rd or 4th belt that this year of Grand Am's had a bad track record w/ the belts. I think it is time to fix that trend. But then I traded mine off and have not been stranded since!<br><br>
