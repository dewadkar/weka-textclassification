            I bought my 95 Sonoma SLS used because I need  an affordable travel solution. For a smaller truck it's very sporty looking, especially in the Maui Blue color mine is. Some cars have terrible hi-beam lights, but the Sonoma's brights really light up the road. The bed is small, but useful transporting small items. Don't expect to hall large pieces of furniture.

The 4 cylinder engine has enough power to pull you out of merging exits nicely.  As for the windshield wipers, they would go out on me for no reason until they finally wouldn't go on anymore. I took it to a dealer and was pleased to find out it was covered under a recall notice. They changed a cracked chip for the motor and now it works perfectly fine.

My only complaints would be that since I'm a "big" guy and this Sonoma isn't the Xtra Cab model, the seat back only reclines so far....it's comfortable enough but I would have like more room to go back. The other complaint is that is rear wheel drive....forget about getting up a big hill if its snow covered.
