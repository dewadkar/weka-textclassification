            I recently traded my 2002 Buick Rendezvous with 15000 miles for a new Honda Pilot.  The only area in which the Rendezvous beat the Pilot was seat comfort.  I'm disappointed with several things about the seats in the Pilot, but all things considered I'm willing to tolerate the seats.  First, the seats in the Pilot are extremely "firm" (okay--hard).  Second, the passenger seat lacks lumbar support and is not power adjustable like the driver's seat.  Third, the driver's seat should have a memory function for seat position.  Finally, the activity tray comes standard on the EX (wish it didn't!!!) and with the activity tray folded back up into the seat, the seat back is exceptionally uncomfortable.  If I were a passenger, I'd choose to be semi-squished in the 3rd row rather than have to use that 2nd row center seat!

Now for the positives----the acceleration is fantastic!  With 240 HP the Pilot is quick and responsive whether you start slow or floor it.  It's also very quiet.  The Pilot handles well, and is far more maneuverable than I expected it to be.  Visibility is also excellent, and getting in and out of parking lots is easy.  I love the hidden storage in the center console area (in front of the cup holders).  Speaking of storage, there is an in-floor storage area in the back for holding headrests if you fold the 3rd row seat down.  

I've really enjoyed this vehicle for the almost 2 months I've had it.  I also bought a cargo liner to go with it, and HIGHLY recommend this (if you don't plan on using the 3rd row seats much).  The liner fits very well, and has cut-outs for all of the grocery hooks, power outlets, etc.  It's very easy to "install" (don't pay the dealer to install it----all you do it velcro it down!)

Finally, for my buying experience.  I paid $1200 under MSRP.  How?  By NOT walking onto the lot and trying to negotiate.  Once I had looked at and driven a Pilot (at a dealership in OKC that is sleazy and that I would NEVER buy from) I then requested quotes online and was able to get a different OKC dealership to quote me $1000 under MSRP.  When I got there to buy it, I was able to get them to come down a shade more and got a fantastic deal on my Rendezvous.  Bottom line:  Get an internet quote first!!!!!
