            What a great little camera. Versatility on the cheap is the name of the game here.  Fuji has a winner with this one.  By sticking a high quality zoom lens on an entry level camera this little gem can make anyone a professional.  The macro mode allows you to get a few inches away from an object and take a picture with a tremendous amount of detail, you will see those flowers in your garden in a whole different light when you see the shots this camera will give you.  Then take it to a sporting event or outing and let the 6x (228mm) zoom lens bring you right into the middle of the action.  Wish you could take a video of a special moment but you left the videocamera at home?  No problem the FinePix 2800 will do that too.  

Several other features are worth noting as well like the ability to use the camera as a webcam.  The camera uses standard SmartMedia memory cards which can be purchased almost anywhere very cheaply not some proprietary format that is going to leave you high and dry.

The picture quality is very high for a 2 megapixel camera.  5x7 prints are film quality, and even on 8x10 prints it's very hard to tell that this is a digital camera.  The colors are very vivid and true to life.  The focus is crisp.  

Some of the drawbacks of this camera is the flash distance is very short only 10 feet.  This will be ok for taking snapshots indoors in a darkly lit room however taking anything outdoors at night is really not an option.  The battery life is short but all digital cameras eat through batteries fast, my recommendation is to buy 2 sets of NIM-H rechargeable batteries and use the LCD as little as possible.  Also turn on the cameras power save mode which will turn off the power after a few minutes of inactivity. There is a removable lens cap included but I would prefer a built in lens cover.  The included memory card is a little small at 16mb, it will give you 19 pictures at the highest resolution.  With the price of memory cards these days I think its time the manufacturers stepped up and offered a little more memory on the starter card.  There is a slight shutter lag, however it is very slight and is only noticeable if you are looking for it.
