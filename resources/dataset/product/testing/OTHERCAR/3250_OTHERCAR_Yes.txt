            I think that this vehicle is a blessing in itself. Besides a great interior availiable with many different options-the exterior looks awesome! My best friend's is equipped with pretty much everything like ac, power EVERYTHING, and it even came with a pioneer stereo system. It was one of the smoothest and the greatest rides I have had in a long time. I mean, I didn't even hear the tahoe start up! If I had to choose a vehicle over the one I already want-then this would be it.<br><br>
