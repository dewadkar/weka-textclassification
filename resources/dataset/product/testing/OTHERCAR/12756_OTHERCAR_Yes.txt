            Fuji 2700

      I would never have believed that a digital camera could be so clear. I was disappointed by the earlier attempts at digital camera technology by a leading brand but have been blown away by the Fuji. You can zoom in on the pictures you have taken and it almost seems as though you are using a magnifying glass when you do this. The detail in the pictures was truly astounding!
   LOOKS: I love the metal casing. With the square shape, it makes the camera look somehow like a 1960's 'bad spy show' version of what futuristic cameras would look like. It certainly stands out against the plain-jane digital cameras that look like dysfunctional versions of the old 35mm's without the door to insert the film. They certainly stand out and helped the decision to buy next to a similar-resolution alternative with a very sad-looking black plastic case. 
   FUNCTIONALITY: The LED screen is a joy to use- so easy to see in all light conditions. The controls are very intuitive. You can take 10 high-resolution snapshots, go through them and delete the unwanted shots so quickly that it is ideal for many different projects- from real estate to the family picnic. You will be amazed at how quickly you have professional looking shots- the sort of pictures that just seem impossible with the analogue alternative. 
   QUALITY: Absolutely crystal clear even when the highest resolution is not used. I'm no going into it anymore that's my verdict: crystal clear.
   DATA STORAGE: Tiny 32mb flash cards store more than 100 low resolution shots. May I just say that I found some these lowest resolution shots good enough to put in the albums. As memory serves, on the highest resolution about 36 photos are possible. It is so amazing isn't it? These flash cards have more memory that most top-shelf PC's from the early 90's. The problem is that I could imagine some people losing such a small data-saving device as they are so small and thin. An adapter that plugs into a USB port allows the cards to be downloaded very quickly and easily.

Battery life could be improved- in fact it is almost inadequate on long trips away from a power point. Apparently Fuji has a longer lasting battery available but I haven't found it necessary. One other negative aspect I will highlight for this product is the metal case. It is supposed to maker the product more robust and I'm sure it could stand up to a beating, but if I happened to drop the unit I would imagine that it would hit a hard surface with a slightly heavier impact [due to the weight of the casing] than if it was a plastic case bouncing off concrete. Sorry- I'm not willing to experiment to prove this point! It may well be paranoia- even so it will not deter me from this fantastic little professional-quality camera.<br><br>
