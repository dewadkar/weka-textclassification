            I bought this camera in the Spring of 1999 before I set off on a 2 1/2 week trip to Colorado.  I only had the 8 megabyte flashcard which came with it.  (Since then I have also bought the 16 megabyte card.) Because of the in-camera editing potential I was able to bring back pictures of the entire trip and I knew that I didn't have any duds!  I think that this is the biggest benefit of digital photography for the average user.

I have found the quality to be excellent and at the &quot;large/normal&quot; setting  I was able to get about 55 shots on the 8 megabyte card.  At this setting I can print out 5x7 enlargements while maintaining the quality.  To get enlargements it is important that the original picture be taken in good lighting.

As long as you have a TV with video input available (TV/monitor) it is great to view the pictures immediately on the screen.

This camera came with both Macintosh and PC cords and software.  The purchase price also included the rechargeable batteries and the AC adaptor/recharger.

While the original camera was list-priced at $600, it was easily purchased at discount. 

Currently this model is discontinued but based on my experience with the camera I would buy a newer model Canon PowerShot at a snap!

Incidentally, I bought it off eBay and it may still be possible to get this model second hand.  <br><br>
