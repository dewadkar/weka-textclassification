            Easy to use camera.
If your looking at this and wonder if it is any good, I'm here to tell you the picture quality is awsome, even amazing photos in low light situations.
the only thing i would consider is the Kodak digital camera in this price range it has a optical zoom rather then digital, but i belive kodaks photo size is smaller then HP's.
The software included with the camera is straight forward and easy to use, actually like sizing photos with hp's program over others i have.
Would strongly recomend a good set of Nihm Recargable batteries when U purchase this camera.
***** UPDATE *******
After about a year of use with this camera.
I would Have to say it is very durable have recently droped smack down on the sidewalk on a recent vacation and no problems as a result.
Camera Takes Nice pictures for the average user.
Still would like a Optical zoom along with Digital.
Two Other down sides :
Camera seems to reset very quickly to original factory settings ( time date and other info) If batterys are not kept in camera( At least i belive that is what causes it).
Also the camera settings do not stay as last used when you turn camera off.
EX: you set your flash and Red Eye and Manual Foucus.
If you turn the camera off between photos your back to factory settings( not ideal for quick shots)
Well hope this helps
