                 Simply CHEAP.  You can't get any cheaper than this.  But for this price, you are not getting anything.  This digital camera simply SUCKS.  The pictures are so pixelated, that you can't even see what the picture is of.  I don't know how this company can even make money with this product.  I bought one, brought it home, set it all up, too a picture, uploaded it onto my computer, and I took it right back to the store.  There was no was I was going to keep that junk and waste my 100 dollars.  I am telling everyone right now, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It may look really good, and you might be lured in by the low price, but don't be fooled.  This product is simply JUNK.<br><br>
