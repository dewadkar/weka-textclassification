            The camera has got to be one of the best, if not the best, consumer digital cameras out there on the market today.

It has an intelligent flash, 2.5 inch screen to view images, precise manual focus for up-close images and so on.....  I've had this camera for a while now and I now have 3 memory sticks.  The 4MB that came with it and one 32MB and on 64MB.  It takes such good images that I find it hard to delete some of the images.  It is also very easy to save the images using the supplied USB cable with software.

I use this camera to create my own webpage and alot of people always ask what kind of digital camera I have because the images are so clear and the color is so life-like.  

Also, this camera is an attention getter.  Whenever I pull it out to take some pictures, people would walk up to me and ask me what the heck it is.  

The images are so good on this camera that I can print out 8 X 11 images and it comes out as clear as real photographs.
