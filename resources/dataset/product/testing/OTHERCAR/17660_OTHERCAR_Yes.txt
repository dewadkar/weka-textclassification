            I wasn&#146t in the market for a digital camera until I saw one of these in Wal-Mart.  After seeing it I couldn&#146t rest until I had one.  It&#146s a pretty slick piece of work.  Its dimensions are the same as those of a credit card except that it is about a centimeter thick.  It is one of the smallest cameras one the market, which is a definite attraction in my mind.  I carry it around in the inside pocket of my jacket and I can hardly tell that it&#146s there.  Having it with me all the time means that I end up taking a lot more pictures than I would otherwise.  This is fine though since the pictures are free.  Ok, on to the details.

<b>The Details</b>

     The Casio EX-S2 has a 1.6 inch TFT color LCD screen on the back.  The camera&#146s menu options are controlled with a small joystick-like button on the back of the camera.  Although the joystick makes it very easy to navigate through the menu, it is quite small and so elderly people or those with large fingers may have trouble using it.  It has many functions for such a small camera: White balance adjustment lets you set the camera for the given lighting conditions.(this helps you avoid taking pictures that are tinted red or blue.)  Exposure compensation lets you further adjust for unusual lighting conditions.  Picture size and quality can be adjusted between 1600 X 1200 pixels and 640 X 480 pixels.  You can also take 30 second videos with 320 X 480 pixel resolution.        
     The camera comes with some built in memory, but you will probably want to buy a memory card for it.  I got a 64 mb SD memory card for mine.  I can take about 70 pictures on the highest quality and 700 on the lowest.  Pictures and videos can be easily loaded on to your computer with the camera&#146s base.  The base plugs into the computer through a usb port and into a wall outlet to recharge the camera&#146s battery.  The camera can be left on without a battery recharge for around 6 hours.  If you run the battery down to zero charge, it takes about two hours to recharge.  The LCD display on the camera shows a battery charge level indicator.   
     Although the camera has a good flash, I rarely use it because the camera&#146s shutter will automatically stay open for as long as it needs to to  capture a picture in poor lighting conditions.  Although the viewfinder in the camera is circular for some reason, I never use it anyway since the display on the back shows you exactly what the picture will look like.  The camera has a 4X digital zoom which is really cool.

<b>The Pictures</b>
	
      Pictures can be taken in automatic or bestshot mode.  In automatic mode everything(white balance, exposure compensation, and flash) is adjusted automatically.  This works fairly well, but I prefer to use bestshot mode.  In bestshot mode you select the situation(Portraits, Scenery, Night Scenes, etc.) and the camera adjusts accordingly.  I usually adjust white balance and camera flash myself however because I am not interested in taking anything but the best pictures possible given the situations.  (All the features of the camera are VERY easy to learn how to use.  In fact, you may not even need to read the instruction manual.)  It focuses from 1 meter to infinity.  The camera takes pretty good pictures (2.11 megapixels), however, if you plan on enlarging pictures to larger than standard 32mm picture size, you may want a camera with better resolution.  For my needs, the quality is fine.  Pictures can be viewed and printed from your PC, or they can be easily developed.  In fact, you can develop them yourself at almost any Wal-Mart.

<b>Memory</b>
	
     The camera comes with enough built-in memory to take about 7 pictures.  You can buy memory card with 32 or 64 mbs of memory.  The camera can be set to memorize the date and any settings you may make.  Once you have taken pictures you can zoom in on them resize them and modify them slightly without taking them off of the camera.  You can also delete them easily.

<b>System Requirements and Software</b>
	
     You will need a usb port and Windows 98 or later, or Macintosh 7.6.1 or later and a Pentium 486 or higher.  The camera comes with the software necessary for uploading to the computer and modifying pictures on the computer.

<b>Complaints</b>
 
     My only real complaints with this camera are that it was expensive, it did not come with a case, and the plug that covers the camera&#146s port hole would be very easy to lose.  You will want to get a case for the camera and be careful with the little plug..
