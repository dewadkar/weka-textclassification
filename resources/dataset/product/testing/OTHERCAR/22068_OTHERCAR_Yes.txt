            If you've messed with those cheaper lesser digital cameras that give
you a somewhat blurry, poor picture then step up now and try this camera.
It will change your opinion of digital. It has tons of features just a few are the LCD, quality controls, red eye remover, 2x zoom, and date imprinting.

The pictures from this camera are extremely colorful and vibrant. I had messed with those cheaper cameras, but with three kids.
I wanted fond memories of things that were, not just blurs of the past.

I have already used it quite a bit and the jpeg compression for this unit is excellent. One other great perk is you can set up a print order, select the pictures you would like to have made into photos, and it will mark them so you can go to the Wal-mart Kodak machine or camera shop with the
memory card and have them developed. Of course, you always can
create a nice archive of pictures by downloading the images to your computer using the serial connector provided with the camera.

The only real problem with the camera is its a battery hog and its very finicky about the type of batteries it uses. I definitely would get the rechargeable batteries that are recommended in the manual. Otherwise you are going to
go through a ton of cash on batteries.

Have a wonderful day<br><br>
