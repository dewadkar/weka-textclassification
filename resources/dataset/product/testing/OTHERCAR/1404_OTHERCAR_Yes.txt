            For four years I drove a 82 Plymouth Reliant (my family owns five of them, and they do make excellent teenager cars). But, like any teenager, I wanted &quot;a shiny car with rounded edges.&quot;  My grandmother had some money tucked away for each of us, and called me with a car she wanted me to look at. At first I was dubious: A Buick?

Once I got behind the wheel, I knew it was perfect. It handled superbly, the shocks on this thing were incredible. Also, it is a safe car.  Although I've never had, or intend to, have a wreck in this car, I'm sure that it is very safe.  There's a lot of steel surrounding me, making it safer than my friends who drive tiny commuter cars.

The car did need a new battery, and the radio went out within two months of purchase.  I found a nice Buick dealer to do the major repair, which resulted from hitting a large chunk of ice: I blew a hole in the transmission pan. Almost three hunderd dollars later I have a new pan and a dealer I trust.

This vehicle surprised me in a lot of ways. First, it's hard to park because of it's elongated trunk.  However, it is capable of very quick acceleration, which surprised me.<br><br>
