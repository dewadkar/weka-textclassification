             Let me first say that this is my second Hyundai vehicle and I have, and still enjoy my newest addition.          I have a 95,which actually is the last year that the company offered this vehicle.I have had my scoupe for 5 years and beyond the oil changes and new tires and new breaks,I have had to other major work done. The car has about 60 k miles on it.          When I went out to buy another car years back I went with the notion of school and finances. I imediatly feel in love with this car, fit right in the budget, had that sport look with  the spoiler.   Upon further look I saw that it also had a moon roof,overdrive,economy gas saver for long road trips,cassette deck,A/C,the rear seats fold down in a 60/40 design for larger loads to carry. All those options I have come to love and cherish.   Hyundai,years ago were given a bad reputation of un-reliable cars.Now mind you I owned one previously and I did have problems.However the company has changed and stands behind the newer cars they build. The only flaw I find with this vehicle is the size.Back in 95 it was just the right size for one person,but as your family grows, you find you need a larger vehicle. I stand behind my SCOUPE  and the many fun road trips it has to offer. <br><br>
