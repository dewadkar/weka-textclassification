            I have owned the LS for nearly a year.  I shopped for 3 months prior to purchasing it.  I could find no better car to purchase for the price.  Given the set of features it seems to be a fair value.

Plus:  good power--but not overwhelming, very good front seats.  good climate control (and easy to use), trainable transmission works well.

Minus: depreciation, dealer reputation, image

Driving the LS is a good feel.  The dead petal seems to be just right.  The car is nearly silent and accelerates well.  Brakes have been more than adequate for my driving.

Most of the technology is well hidden.  Not a lot of buttons or things to fiddle with.  The car is quite competent without a lot of fuss.

I got a better car than I expected.
