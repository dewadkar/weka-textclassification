            I bought my very first car in 1996- a used 1993 Geo Storm, base model. It wasn't my first choice, nor my second, third, or fourth. It was the only choice I could remotely afford. And I was so disappointed that I did not get something better. But I was wrong. I have never had a single problem with this car; not once. I had AC installed, a CD player, and an alarm system. The only problem I had was with the alarm system and that was not installed by GEO. This car originally, up until a year ago, performed commutes of over 120 miles each day, sometimes further. It moved me across country (So. California to No. New England), loaded down, while still managing 38-40 miles to the gallon, with the AC ON. It has survived the cold New England winters and their hot humid summers. My husband now uses it for his business. Not a single piece of hardware has broken, and the seats though not the peak in comfort look great. I ashamedly don't change the oil or have tune-ups performed as often as I should, and it still runs like a charm. I always knocked American made cars... especially GEO. I was counting the days from the day I drove it home until I could sell it and get something better. Now four years later, maintenance free, trouble free, I still own my white Storm and probably will keep it till it's last days. It has over a hundred thousand miles on it and is still going strong. It is reliable, dependent, and fun; a great buy for someone getting their first car or for someone who needs the reliability in a used car.
