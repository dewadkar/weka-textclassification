            I recently purchased the AGFA ePhoto CL30 Digital camera from Wal-mart for $249.99.  I've only used it for a few days, but here are my findings so far.  

It actually takes pretty good pictures, bottom line.  It is easy to use without reading the manual (which I never do).  Just put batteries in it and start playing.  The enclosed software is just as easy, but is very limited.  I strongly recommend a photo suite if you want to do anything other than print, save, or e-mail the photo's.

What sets this camera apart from other camera's in it's price range is all the extras that come with it.  You get a cable package that is top notch.  It includes a MAC adapter, a serial cable, a video cable, and a USB cable.  The USB cable is so much faster than the serial cable that I can't imagine using anything else.  You just plug it in and turn it on, the software starts and downloads the pictures automatically.  It doesn't get much simpler than that.

The major drawback to this camera is it's battery consumption.  Definitely buy extra batteries.  Better yet, buy the lithium AA's instead of the alkalines, they should last 3 times longer.

If you want a camera for professional digital photography, buy one of those $3,000 rigs.  If you want a camera that will take a decent picture, is easy to use, and you don't mind buying batteries, tha AGFA ePhoto CL30 might be right for you.<br><br>
