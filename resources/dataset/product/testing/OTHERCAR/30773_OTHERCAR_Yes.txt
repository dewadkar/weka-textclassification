            I guess I was influenced too much by my &quot;advanced&quot; friends, web page design, computer magazines and media when I finally decided to purchase a digital camera. My search started in Best Buy, Comp Usa and ended in Wal Mart (don't laugh though). I purchased an Olympus D-340R thinking that now I will be taking pictures all the time and share them with all my friends instantly through e mail. And it did turn out to be a fairly good camera, a bit heavy compared to &quot;mini&quot; cameras I was used to in the past.

My first steps using Olympus started with a simple curiosity to see the image on the little LCD screen. After taking a few pictures I realized that the button which turns the LCD screen on is not an easy one. I had to push it really hard and many times before the LCD screen finally displayed the image. Also, LCD screen took its time before turning on. I was thinking, gosh, if I ask somebody to take a picture of me or something they would probably think the camera doesn't work.

Overall, the camera's performance is quite satisfactory. However, the pictures tend to come out a way too bright even though the flash is turned off. And that was annoying especially when you want a take darker pictures for some reason.

I really liked the idea of viewing the slides on my TV screen through the cable provided with the camera. Also, the camera's software provided was alright to use to view pictures on my computer.

I liked Olympus but I would recommend to wait a bit or search around for better camera, with larger SmartMedia card (Olympus' is 4 MB), and maybe something smaller (I like compact electronics in general)
