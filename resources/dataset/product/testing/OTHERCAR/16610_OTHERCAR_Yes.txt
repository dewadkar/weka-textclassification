            When I bought my 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier, I was looking for a car with more room due to the fact that we were getting ready for our 2nd baby.

I love any Chevrolet!  Chevy's are dependable and roomy.  We bought our Chevy used.  The exterior and interior both are beautiful and well designed.  It looks sporty inside and "mommy" on the outside.  I can even fit an extra kid or two in the back.  It has powered windows, ABS, A/C, bucket seats, and good on gas.  We have had our Chevy for almost four years now and have never done a tune up.  That's wrong, but my mommy car has been extremely good to us to the fact that we haven't done regular maintenance on it.
