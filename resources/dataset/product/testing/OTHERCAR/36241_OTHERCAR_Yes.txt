            I first wrote this review more than a year ago.
So I thought I'd update it.

I have a 1991 Corsica LT 3.1 V6 with the 3 speed auto.
My dad bought her off the lot in November of 91. 
She now has 125,000 miles.
Here's what has been replaced since 1992 (aside from the usual brake pads, filters, etc..):
Alternator x2 (1993 & 1997), fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, water pump, and serpentine belt.  All of those things only add up to $500.
Very reasonable for a car that has taken so much abuse over so many years.

I live in Minnesota.  When I walk outside in the winter, and see people having problems starting their cars I can't help but smile, because I know my car will start right up.
-And it always has.

It handles great all year round, even in deep snow.  She's never gotten stuck.

I love how even though it is technically an 'economy' car, it doesn't feel cheap.  The interior is very comfortable, and very roomy.  (Even if you're 6'1", like me)

The V6 engine is not only peppy, but unbelievably reliable.
I have had several emails from viewers of my site tell me their Corsica has over 300,000 miles on it, and is still going!

Most say this car is a good first car, which it most certainly is..but I think it's a great car for anyone, of any age that wants reliable, comfortable transportation.
These cars require so little maintenance it's unreal.
I literally only give it gas, change the oil every 3k miles and change the air and fuel filters every year.

I think I can honestly say, that you will not be disappointed if you buy a Corsica.  Just make sure it has been properly maintained.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, etc..
Check out my site @ www.angelfire.com/mn/ChevyCorsica for more information or email me at ChevyCorsicaGirl@yahoo.com

Oh and I almost forgot.  I still get 27.7 miles per gallon..even with 125 thousand miles.
