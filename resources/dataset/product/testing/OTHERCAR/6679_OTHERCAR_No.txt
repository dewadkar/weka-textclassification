            DON'T BUY IT.

I could probably end the review here and you'd get my point but if you're even close to thinking about a Volvo I should explain why not to buy one. 

This car has been in the repair shop more than the last three cars (two Japanese one American) I owned put together. The front windows both fell of the track due to a failure of the window cassette. They, of course, fell off at different times. The parts were in Sweden. Now after the first time someone at Volvo might have figured to keep a few nearby, but no. I waited almost a month, during prime top down weather, with the car in the shop waiting for the parts until I just took the car back, taped the window button so no one could touch it and did so until the part arrived on the slowest boat in town.

All four tires have failed (all sidewall failure) and the dealer tells me their best deal will have me paying $1,000.00 for new tires (Grand Spirit brand!?) and wheels. They refuse to acknowledge that either the tires are defective or just a plain wrong choice for the car.

The turn signal system has completely failed twice. The convertible top has locked halfway up TWICE (once 2 weeks after repair). Master window control has failed multiple times. Radiator hose ruptured but was in Sweden with all the other parts Volvo needs here but doesn't adequately stock.

Add to this a Stepford Wife approach to customer service that makes granite seem warm and you have a Volvo experience that makes me appreciate every other car I ever owned. Please visit volvosucks.net if I haven't convinced you yet.
