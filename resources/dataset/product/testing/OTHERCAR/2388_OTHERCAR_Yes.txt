            When shopping for a digital camera, you probably want the most for your dollar right? Who doesn't? After doing exstensive research on cameras, finding this one was a blessing. While I could state a bunch of specs and fill this space with technical stuff, I'm sure you can go to the Toshiba.com web site for yourself. 

I wanted a camera that had would give me clear still pictures and short movies. Having never used a digital camera before, I wanted one that was REALLY easy to use. This one is menu driven. In short, I needed a camera that is simple enough to learn on, yet will allow me to take really awsome pictures if I ever get better at photography.

It's a simple camera in some resects. 
You can use it to just point and shoot. No worries about focusing though, it does that for you. You can set the flash to one spot and just leave it there. At this level, it basically acts kind of like a regular film camera.

Here's where it gets better.
You can set your flash to different levels to accomidate for stuff like low light & red eye reduction.
There are different modes that help you get the best pictures possible. While taking pictures of my toddler I found the burst mode to be incredibly helpful. It takes a series of pictures in quick sucession. Good for moving subjects and if you've ever tried to get a toddler to sit still for a picture you can see how handy this is. 
If you get really good, there's a manual mode so you can mess around with settings.

drawbacks.
Unfortunatly there is quite a delay from when you push the button to when the camera actually takes the picture. While annoying, it's easily worked around. 

Low lighting makes it almost impossible to shoot using your LCD screen. Movie mode? You can do it in low light but your movie might suck. 

The battery has a decent life. Being rechargable is good, yet bad. If you're out some where and your battery dies, unless you have another one or use your adapter, you're out of luck. On the plus side, we all know how expensive it can get when you have to buy batteries all the time. 

What I got with my camera.
With my camera I recived a 8 meg "smart media" card, a lens cap, a carry strap, and software. The software is really cool and makes getting your pics easy. You just "get images". 

Extras.
I did buy a LCD screen protector. After a few uses I found that my thumb always seems to end up on the screen. Not wanting to dirty or scratch my screen I got a proctector that I can replace if I have to. I also bought a camera bag for it since the thought of haveing my investment floating around wasn't appealing. Screen protector: about $10 off ebay. Camera bag I think was $20 or so off the Toshiba web site. I also bought another media card. I got a 32 meg card and it didn't cost more than what I would have spent in a month for film and developing.

Picture stuff. 
I keep my Camera set to take 800X600 pics. That's "medium" size. I have it set at medium quiality. This allows me to take a good amount of pics and not have them look crummy.
800X600 is what most people have thier computer screen resoultion set at. 
Macro setting can get you VERY close. I was able to take some neat pics of the inside of a flower without it getting blurry. 
Overall, I think the pictures are crispy looking and FAR better than my 35mm film camera.

More extras.
There's a ton of other stuff you can buy to add to your camera. Do you really like the "floppy disk" idea? You can get a floppy that you plug your media into and get your pics that way. You can get tripods, lenses, bags, faster rechargers, bigger media cards.... There's no shortage of accesories to buy if you want more add ons.

Durability? 
Well, I don't know about that as I've never dropped my camera. I really don't think it would withstand a lot of abuse though. My little brother had a very expensive untill he dropped it about 4 feet. Now he has a very exspenive paper weight. As long as you hold on to your camera for dear life and don't drop it, I think it'll last for a long time.

Overall.
I think it's a great camera. It's few drawbacks are easily worked around. I bought my camera as a refurbished model from the Toshiba web site. The price was definetly right. It has a lot of options and quality for the price tag.
