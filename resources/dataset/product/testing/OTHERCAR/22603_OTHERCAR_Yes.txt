            In December of �93 I finally got to have a new car instead of my husband�s hand-me-down. Well, it wasn�t exactly new since it was the Toyota dealer�s car.

<b>Background</b>

I never did have "ego thing" with cars. To me they were just 5 wheels-one to steer-that got me where I wanted to go.
I had been crawling around in a Ford Escort hatchback. I hated this car. It had no power. When I wanted to pass another car, I swear I heard it say, �You want me to do WHAT? �  When it finally decided to get into the other lane to pass, time and the earth stood still. �I�m not going to make it passed this car this time.� Pulling onto the super highways was a nightmare; close my eyes, floor it, and pray. I could always tell when I was driving over 50 because the car vibrated.

<b>The Search</b>

So we went searching for a new car. I tested the Saturn. Hubby loved it; I felt like a sardine in it. There was no elbowroom. It felt like the door was resting on my arm. We have always bought American cars whereas my brother-in-law, the racecar driver, always bought Toyotas. So off to Toyota we went. The dealer showed us several, but it was the blue I decided to test. Anything blue is great for me. As I started to drive down the country road, I thought I better take it slow since I didn�t want to scare this guy. (My speeding tickets attest to my heavy foot.) I thought I was doing about 25 or 30 mph. When I looked down, I was doing 55. Hmmm, blue and it has power. Sold!

<b>The Gem</b>

This �93 Corolla was the dealer's car. It had 5121 miles on it. To me it is loaded! It has air conditioning, a sunroof that opens or tilts, tape deck, power windows, anti-lock brakes, and a driver�s air bag. The bucket seats have a soft blue fabric. I get about 25 to 30 mpg. The back seats pull down for more trunk space, and the trunk is very spacious.

It is totally dependable even when I leave the headlights on at school. I have no fear of pulling onto the highways, just floor it and off we go.

Several times a year my husband gets the oil changed and belts and filters checked. I have had to replace the brake pads. Maybe I am riding the brakes? Other than that we have had no major problems.

<b>The Complaints</b>

Most annoying is the trunk lock that keeps freezing, but there is a level under the driver�s seat that open the trunk. The back ashtray keeps falling out, and it is way too small. Legroom in the back is not adequate for a taller person.

We paid about $15,000 for this baby and I am developing and "ego thing" about my Toyota.
