            When it was time to trade in my 1992 Grand Prix,  I have to admit I had second thoughts about buying another Pontiac.  I had had several problems with the electrical system in my '92 which was the whole reason for trading it in.  I went ahead and at least went to the dealership to take a look at the new 1998 models.  I figured they had to have gotten those electrical bugs worked out in the past six years.  

After being greeted by the best salesman at Freeman Pontiac, Ken Kramer, I saw it:   The 1998 Grand Prix GTP Limited Edition Daytona 500 Pace Car.  My first thought? It will be mine...oh yes, it will be mine. 

This car has it all.  It was the only blue Grand Prix made in 1998.  It has racing flags up the sides with the Daytona Pace Car Logo on both sides, on the back and inside both doors as well as under the gear shift.  

Options and why I love them:

The keyless entry gives access to both doors as well as the trunk. 

The heads up display makes driving a breeze.  It is a bright color just like the rest of the instruments.

The automatic headlights are the best.  I NEVER have to turn them on.  They just know to come on.  It's great.  

The back seat and trunk are very spacious.  There is also access to the trunk from inside the car in case someone locks the keys in the trunk.  

Not that I need this in Texas, but there is a driver side butt warmer that is just too cool.  

There are also dual airbags, leather seats, anti-lock brakes, and of course...the supercharged engine.  Get a radar detector.  You will need it.  I have only one gotten one ticket so far...knock on wood.  It also came with the alarm  system which gave me a break on the cost of insurance. 

One word of advice here.  Since I have the supercharged engine I will only use Mobil One oil and I get the oil changed at the dealership.  This does make the oil change a little more expensive but I feel it is worth it.  

What I love about this car:  It looks great.   I love having a car that no one else has.  Only 1,500 of these were made in 1998.  I have #1353. When people see it they know it is special.   I also love that it goes fast but the ride is very smooth.  

What I don't like about this car:  There has been one electrical glitch.  The motors in both windows fizzled out, but were quickly fixed with no other problems.  The passenger side air bag was loose when I bought it but has been fixed with no more trouble.  I do think it was a great idea to buy the extended warranty.

This was the first car I bought literally off the showroom floor and I absolutely love it.  1 1/2 years and 15,000 miles later, it is truly the best car decision I ever made.

***Update***  I have now had my Pontiac for well over two years and I am still madly in love with it.  It still looks great and still gets lots of looks.  I have not had any other mechanical problems with the car.  It has been the most reliabole car I have ever driven.
