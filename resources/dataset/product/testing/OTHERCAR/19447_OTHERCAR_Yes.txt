            The Mazda Millenia is the 5th Mazda car I have purchased.  I almost bought one about 4 years ago but, because of the price tag at the time, I purchased a Honda Accord instead.  But when I traded the Honda, I went back to the Mazda Millenia and I am sure glad I did.  It is a very well made car.  I have had no mechanic problems what so ever.  In the past, I have owned an RX7, a 929 and 2 MPV's.  I truly enjoy the Mazda brand of cars because of their great quality, durability and warranty.  The dealer in my area (Ft. Lauderdale) is fabulous regarding service and parts.  You make an appointment and they are ready and waiting for you.  If you plan to wait for your car ro be serviced, they even have a professional masseur there to give free massages while you wait!  Can't beat that!!

The Millenia is heavy so it hugs the road well.  It handles incredibly well for a luxury type of car.  It has a sports car feel to it.  The sound system, which is an important feature to me, is impressive.  I test drove a Saab - loved the car but hated the sound system so decided against the car.  That is how important the sound system is.  The car has great power both from the line and when already at speed.  It is very nicely appointed inside.  I have always been impressed with the interior of Mazda cars.  They add all the little extras that are nice to have.

I love the air conditioning control of the car.  You set a temperature number and forget about it.  The system controls the air, heat, and amount to regulate the interior temp.

The only negative I can think of about the car is with front wheel drive, I seem to wear out the front passenger tire fairly quickly.  At 10,000 miles I put on 2 new front tires. ( one had a nail in it and had to be replaced anyway)  <br><br>
