            Hi, my name is Edwin Ferrer and I'm the proud owner of a Saturn SL2. The SL2 is the best car I have ever owned by far. There are many reasons for this. One reason the Saturn SL2 is a good car is that it is very affordable starting at $13,999. That is just were the savings start. It is also very cheap to fill your gas tank $15.00 at $1.50 per gallon, and that fifteen dollars will last you about 400 miles on the highway and about 260 miles in the city. The insurance on a Saturn SL2 is very inexpensive it costs me (an 18 yr. old male with six points on his license) $589.64 every six months, due to all of the saftey features. Which brings me to the second reason you should consider buying the Saturn SL2. It comes with child lock doors, child saftey windows, dual airbags, and steal framing on all four doors (to protect from side impacts.) The SL2 also comes with anti-lock brakes. Finally I feel you should buy the Saturn SL2 or any other make is ,because of the friendly and caring staff of the Saturn team. They really make your buying experience a pleasant one. The SL2 is the ideal car for people who like to go on long road trips, due to its superb handling and its ability to go on for ever (or so it seems) without having to refuel. It is also the perfect car for a family of up to five, due to its multiple saftey features and its roomy interior. It is my sincere belief that if you go out and buy a Saturn SL2 you will not only be pleased with what you received for your money, but will show it off to your friends and loved ones. <br><br>
