            Best thing about this van is the engine and ride - powerful engine, quiet,
good handling - I can forget I'm in a big van and not a sporty sedan.
Next best thing is the power doors. I've heard horror stories about them, but mine have been flawless (knock on wood), and it is awesome to be able to open the door with a remote and have it slide open when walking up with a load of groceries. I also like that the back seats fold completely out of sight, that is the main reason I chose the Odyssey over the Toyota Sienna because the Sienna doesn't. 
Worst thing is the seats - much less comfortable than my 92 Toyota Previa van. Front bucket seats feel hard and bench-like. Why isn't leather available as option like all competing vans?
Also suprisingly bad front passenger legroom for a big van. I have a friend who is 6'0&quot; tall, and her knees barely fit in the passenger seat. Second worst thing is the anemic sound system,
No subwoofer, bad FM reception, radio has even less bass than CD player.
My old factory Toyota Previa system made the Honda system sound pathetic.
After I had the van a month I couldn't stand it and tore out the Honda system and put in a whole custom system with subwoofer, which was very expensive and hard to install because Honda did not design in a subwoofer locations. When we pulled out the factory speakers, we saw they were ultra-cheap paper cone, lightweight magnet speakers like a car from the 60's.
Only problem I have had is the SRS (air bag) light going on. Waiting for a part from the dealer on that.
Note: this van is BIG. Parallel parking spaces that I wouldn't think twice about pulling into in the Previa require careful alignment in the Odyssey.<br><br>
