            This is the best digital camera that I have seen for the money it cost.  This is my third digital camera and I love it.  The first one was a little cheap off brand I got at an auction, never could get it to work very well.  Then I bought the Polaroid PDC 320. It was pretty good but didn't do just what I wanted so I then purchased the Polaroid PDC 640.  I was very pleased with it. 
   The Polaroid PDC 640 has the ac adapter, batteries, a camera to computer serial cable , and Polaroid's PhotoMax Image Maker Software all included in the kit. It also includes a carrying case and wrist strap. Everything you will need to start is there. One thing I did truly like about this camera was the 1.8in. LCD display on the back of the camera.  I can take pictures and see exactly what the picture will look like before downloading them on the computer.  If I do not like them they can be deleated right then.
  This camera comes with a 640 x 480 or 320 x 249 pixel resolution.You can store up to 50 pictures on the camera its self.  A person could purchase another memory card for the camera if they need more memory.  These cards are relatively cheap and come in different sizes.
   The pictures are always so clear and crisp.  The software that comes with the camera is so easy to use.  A person can do all sort of things with the software, send in e-mails, albums, cards and such.The software allows you to do a lot of special effects to the pictures, such as getting rid of red eye. It is so easy to use and understand the software. I print off a lot of my pictures and found that the photo paper makes the pictures a lot plainer.  
   I just love my camera and use it every day. It is very light weight and a rugged little camera. I have dropped it a couple of times but it still works fine. Just purchased another one for a very special Christmas gift for someone. I would recommend this camera very highly.  <br><br>
