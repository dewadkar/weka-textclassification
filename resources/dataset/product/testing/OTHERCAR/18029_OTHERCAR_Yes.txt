            I went from a 7 foot tall, 22 foot long Monster Truck to what looked like an Oscar Mayer Wiener Mobile. I thought I would just die. Little did I know I would soon come to love this mini van of mine. It can go from passenger van to cargo van to camper van, with the greatest of ease. Even for a female by herself. One thing about these little vans every thing is as economy as could be. The seats come out with just a flip of a switch, and pop back in with a simple click. If you need to haul something and the seat belts are in your way just undo the safety clip and put them in the side pocket on the van. If you ever needed to sleep in the van, the seats fold down into a bed that comfortably sleeps two adults in a pinch. It has both front and rear cooling with separate controls. Oh and things are located in some of the oddest places... The drivers seat lifts up to get to your engine. I do find that to be a little strange and at times rather inconvenient. The master cylinder is in the drivers side door jam. The windshield washer fluid fill hole is in the floor board under the carpet in front of the front passengers seat. The power steering fluid goes in behind the front passenger seat. You just simply fold the carpet back and unscrew a wing nut to remove a little panel and there you fill the power steering fluid. Maybe this design contributes to it's spaciousness. 
I had the mis-fortune of getting rear ended once, and it held up wonderfully. As for the other car is was totaled. My van didn't even get a dent, just the bumper was  slightly affected.
