            We bought the <b>Volvo V70</b> when we found out I was pregnant with my son, because we had heard it was the safest car on the market. I love my <b>Volvo</b>. It is fairly reliable, but more importantly, we feel very safe in it. It is like driving around in a steel cage.

There were a few little problems with it here and there during the first year I was driving it...ie: a headlight dying, a turn signal dying. But these were such minor things and they did not really affect the safety of my car as long as I got them fixed right away. 

During this, my second year of driving the car, we have made more frequent visits to the service shop. My brakes were squeaking and needed replacing. The "leather" on the inside of the door panels pulled away from the door and bubbled up. They were replaced under warranty. There was a slow leak in one of the tires and it needed to be plugged. Most recently, I have been having problems with the battery dying any time I leave the car for more than an hour. This was resolved by refilling the water in the battery and hooking it up to a charger for 10 hours. Unfortunately, after this incident, the theft-proof radio needed to be turned back on by inputting the four digit code (which I no longer had). After two failed attempts at guessing the code, the radio "shut down." I then had to set the car in "accessory" mode for two hours to reset the theft-protection system before I was able to put the correct code in. So, the trend here is this: the <b>Volvo V70</b> tends to have a lot of little annoying problems that lead to several hours without the car...and a lot of headaches.

The <b>Volvo V70</b> has poor pickup, this makes it difficult to get on freeways and busy streets safely. The V90 model has a larger engine. If I were to go for another <b>Volvo</b> sometime down the road, I would probably opt for the V90. 

This car is perfect for people with little ones. There is ample room in the back seat for a carseat, and more than ample room in the way back to fit strollers, diaper-bags and various other baby paraphernalia. It is also very good on gas mileage. 

I am moderately happy with my <b>Volvo V70</b>. Some days I love it...other days I am so frustrated with all the little problems I have with it. But the bottom line is...it is a very safe car and it gets me where I need to go (unless, of course, it is in the shop again).
