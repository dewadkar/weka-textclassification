            I bought a used purple 200SX-SER in '96 and have been pretty much tickled pink by it. I test drove a new SE but found the engine lacking, the saleman pointed out that he had a used SER for about the same price as the new SE, after one test drive I was hooked. Lots of power, light weight car and tons of options. I have since put 140,000kms on the purple people eater and other than a brake job have had no troubles. I've been through the Rockies three times in winter without incident and the car has never failed to start despite winter temps of -45C!

There are lots of aftermarket add-ons available for the SER to increase power and handleing, I've just done the exhaust and air intake but the change was quite noticable. 

So until I can afford that BMW I'll keep on surprising those Integra and Mustang V6 geeks with my SER.<br><br>
