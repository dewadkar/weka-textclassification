            I just purchased my new 2001 Saturn L200 on Saturday.  I had a 1998 Saturn SL2 before than.  My husband was really interested in the V-6 but after driving the L200 which is a four cylinder he very impressed with the power the car had. I really enjoy this new car.  It has electric everything.  We really love the Saturn dealership. They are really a " No Hassle" company.  We have bought three cars from them and the first one was not a Saturn and it was treating as if it was.

The salesperson, Don B. at the Jackson, MS dealership took all the information over the phone and was able to get financing and tag,title and lincese done before arrived.  It is well worth the hour and half drive to purchase a great car.

I love the larger size of the L-series. My SL2 was good but it was soon crowded with the addition of a second child. We now have room for another person to sit in back comfortable. And now I actually have trunk.  I can fit my stroller and bags of food. What a concept.

If you are consindering a  Saturn L-series. Please take the time to test drive one. You will not be unhappy.  And just think you won't to sit around while the salesperson "talks" the dealership manager on the "offer" you made on the car.  What price you see on the sticker is what you pay.  The way I like it.
