            The Roadmaster is a work of art.  It is remarkably engineered from the great suspension to the outstanding body.  The ride is so smooth you forget you are in the vehicle.  The inside of the vehicle is very spacious and it is very comfortable. The leather seats are wonderful.  All the other features in the vehicle such as the power windows, power locks and seats are very convenient.  All the other features such as the cup holder, the coin holder and the other compartments come in very handy.  The sound system is awesome, great sound.  This is the best vehicle engineered and designed by the Buick Company. I always get second looks when I drive this vehicle.
