            After our second child was born, we decided we needed a bigger vehicle.  We went looking at all different mini-vans, and I liked the Dodge Grand Caravan the best.  It is roomy, easy to drive, has good visibility while driving, and is good on gas.  We have a V-6 engine, and the double sliding doors on both sides.  We bought it used, it's a 1996.

I have 2 children in car seats, so the double door feature is wonderful.  I don't have to stretch across to try to fasten the kids in. The side doors also have child locks, so I don't have to worry about my older child getting out of the vehicle while I am stopped.

The thing I don't like though, is I have had many problems with the electronic windows in the back.  The motors seem to burn out easily, and I have had it replaced twice (covered under warranty).  From what I have been told, it is a &quot;Chrysler&quot; problem.

Another nice feature is that the rear seats are very easy to remove and put back in, for extra space.  Even with all of the seats in the van, I still have room in the back for 2 strollers, and groceries.  All in all, it's a great vehicle.<br><br>
