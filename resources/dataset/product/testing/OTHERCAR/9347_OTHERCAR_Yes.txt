            The newest camera to come into my hands, the Olympus C2500-L is a good, bordering on excellent, camera.

It is designed for the &quot;prosumer&quot;.  It is an SLR camera which means that when you look through the viewfinder, you're looking out throughout the lens.  This provides a far more accurate view of your framed subject.  It seems that because it is an SLR, Olympus decided that the LCD should not be used for framing pictures and it is therefore not possible use the LCD as a framing tool, unlike most other digital cameras with LCDs.  This was probably done to reduce the load on the batteries as well - the effect is noticed as the battery life for the camera is fairly impressive.

Aside from the TTL viewfinder and color preview LCD, the camera also features a larger than average LCD status display which displays the status of many of the camera's manual controls.  It also has a hot shoe for external flashes and a remote control for remote photography.  A self-timer mode is also available.  A 3x optical zoom lens is built-in to the camera and optional wide-angle and tele-photo lenses are available.  The camera can accept both SmartMedia and CompactFlash Type I cards simultaneously.  A fairly generous 32MB SmartMedia card is included.  No CompactFlash card is included.  It's a shame that the camera can't use CompactFlash Type II cards as they come in sizes up to 340MB.  A set of AA-size Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries and three-hour charger also come in the box.  An optional AC adapter for using the camera without batteries is available, but not included.  The camera can be connected to an NTSC video display or a Mac or Windows PC (serial, not USB) using included cables and software.  Finally, a camera strap with lens cap holder is also included.

The camera has many manual controls that need to be learned before using it to its full potential.  This may scare away new photographers, digital or not.  Once the controls are learned, you will find them fairly easy to operate.  I would not call them intuitive, simply easy to remember after reading about them first.  Image quality is excellent for photos taken in well lit situations.  I found the flash to be a bit over-powering in its default settings and even when well exposed, the flash tinted the subject with a blue tone.  This is the case even though the camera fires a test flash to set the white balance before taking the actual image.  Macro shots using the flash will result in a barrel shadow caused by the barrel mounted location of the flash.  The auto focus mechanism is fast and accurate, even in low-light.  It is capable of low-light auto-focus through the use of a focus assist light mounted on the bottom of the barrel.  This is a very nice feature.  The zoom lens moves through its range very smoothly and crisply.  The camera has three image capture modes, manual, aperture priority and programmed.  In manual mode you have complete control over aperture and shutter settings as well as zoom, white balancing, spot metering, focus mode, flash settings, film speed selection and exposure compensation.  In aperture priority mode you get the same as controls as in manual mode except for shutter speed which is automatically selected based on aperture setting and light metering.  Programmed mode is essentially a point-and-shoot mode with no controls except for zoom, focus, spot metering and flash settings.  Additional non-image capture controls allow the user to copy images from one card to another while both in the camera, as well as the standard print tagging and deleting of images and formatting of media.

Final image quality is a little different from the quality shown on the LCD after capturing an image.  This may lead one to believe that an image is of inferior quality until it is actually viewed on a PC.  This is unfortunate as the preview features of a digital camera are one of their biggest selling points and if a camera shows a bad preview image, you may over compensate on the next image which will actually end up creating a bad final image on the PC.  If you can get by the bad previews and &quot;trust&quot; the camera's capabilities, you will find that its image quality is first rate.

Overall, I found the camera to be better than any other Olympus digital camera and both slightly better (battery life and final image quality) and slightly worse (preview images and ease of use) than some of its non-SLR competitors like the Nikon Coolpix 950.  But definitely a worthy camera and, most likely, my camera of choice.<br><br>
