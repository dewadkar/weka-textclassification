            In January of 2000 I bought a used '91 240SX for $3500. It's one of the best cars I've ever owned--excellent gas milage, but enough power to scorch any Civic that revs his wimpy engine at me at a stop light. It's light and quick with a very respectable suspension layout and tours like a dream. I love that it's easy to work on and easy to modify, but modern enough that you don't miss out on anything you would get in a more recent middle-of-the-line sports car. The engine is reliable, quiet, and strong. It has a good factory stereo for the time period, but the antenna motor is prone to problems. The electrical system tends to have minor problems in general. The clutch is powerful enough to speed shift very effectively, but not so tight that it's difficult to shift smoothly. If you're looking for a good looking, fast, reliable car, the '91 240 is a great choice. If you're looking for luxury or a lot of bells and whistles you might consider something else.<br><br>
