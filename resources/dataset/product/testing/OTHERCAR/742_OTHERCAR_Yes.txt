            I bought my 94 Altima because I wanted something sporty yet affordable. I have had it for 6 years this May. It has a spoiler and a bra which spruces it up a bit more. It has 107K miles and still runs great! Except for the usual oil changes and new tires I have had no major expenses on this car. I think it's been in the shop twice.
  
The antenna is automatic which is a drawback because living in Maine it can get iced up and become stuck. I had it replaced once but it was under warranty at the time so there was no expense for me there. I think the new ones aren't automatic.

This one is a standard transmission I like driving a standard because it's more like a sports car and I have more control. The interior is a good size for me but my husband is 6'3&quot; and a bit cramped in it while driving. The passenger seats are very comfortable and good for long distances.  The back seat has a fold down arm rest which has another piece that comes down for trunk access, allowing snow skies for example to fit nicely. 

I will definitely buy another one when the time comes!<br><br>
