            Need some sex appeal?  Get the Spyder.  Really now, everybody knows that a car will not make you attractive..�yeah right!  This ride exudes power, good looks, and style.  The Spyder is the Mitsubishi Eclipse�s wild younger brother.  The convertible top was made for old time cruising.  Just push the button and head to you favorite people watching location.  Everyone there will be looking at you. 

The only thing I would change is the age-old problem for all convertibles, blind spots.  When the top is up you can not see a thing in around your back quarter panels.  Also, if you are planning to purchase any type of convertible you might as well get it into your mind that you will eventually be broken into.  Those soft-tops are just too tempting for crooks.  Mitsubishi tries to make the Spyder less tempting by providing alarms, locking glove box, and anti-theft CD player.  You can deter criminals by not leaving ANYTHING out in plain view.

The Spyder is a smooth and sporty ride with few problems. During the year that I have owned my vehicle it has never been taken into the shop for mechanical problems.  I do not own the turbo version so I don�t know if there is more upkeep around those.  

Overall I would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a convertible.  One huge bonus over many others is the Spyder�s glass back window. You will not have to worry about those nasty plastic windows cracking and fading. <br><br>
