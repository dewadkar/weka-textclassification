            A few years back, when my friends and I discovered the fun and enjoyment of camping, I had made the decision to buy a pick-up truck as an extra vehicle that I could use as a &quot;sport utility&quot;. Seeing that it wasn't going to be my main mode of transportation, I started to look for something inexpensive yet dependable with four wheel drive. The longer I searched though, I started to become more and more disappointed because just about every four wheel drive truck I wanted was outrageously priced, even the ones that were beat up. As I was just about ready to give up my search, I stumbled on a Dodge Dakota Sport 4x4 truck that was within my price range. I was a little skeptical at first because of the price but then decided &quot;OK, I'll just look at one more truck and that is it.&quot; Well, I'm glad I did.

The truck isn't exactly what you would call brand new. The body has definitely seen better days, (probably much earlier than when it got that big dent in the passenger side door!, but I bought it anyway). But what impressed me was how strong the engine still ran and how solid the four wheel drive still was, and that's after 150 K miles! So I figured &quot;why not, I'm only going to use it for camping and a few other odd jobs.&quot; 

It's strongest point is it's dependability. It always starts up on the first try and it has a lot of the features that you would find in some of the other popular trucks - skid plates, protected brake lines, roll bar with fog lights, four wheel drive on the fly, front fog lights, dual steel bed and so forth. On the down side, the gas mileage is not good - 15 city, 20 highway. This is because both front and back differentials are always turning when you drive, whether you're in four wheel drive or not. This is pretty much  a standard thing when it's a 4x4 where you don't lock the front hubs. Also, the bed is only six feet long which does limit what you can carry in the back somewhat. 

However, for camping, mountain biking or skiing it is a convenient vehicle and if you are a little creative you can find a way to haul some of the bigger stuff with it. Bottom line is that I have already gotten my money's worth out of it so why not keep it until something major breaks on it. Then I guess I'll be forced to put a crowbar into my wallet (weep) and buy a new one but if I do, I'm almost positive it will be another Dodge Dakota Sport.<br><br>
