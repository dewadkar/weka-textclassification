            I purchased HP C200xi for my son in California and was really impressed with the camera. It took excellant pictures and was easy to use. It appeared to be a excellant buy for the money.

When I decided to purchase a digital camera, I compared different cameras and selected a HP C200xi for myself.  When the camera was delivered I opened the package and removed the camera and all of the paperwork.  I noticed that there was nor warranty registration card enclosed.  

After examining the camera, I wanted to remove the flash card and attempted to remove it.  When I pulled up on the flash card ejector button (this straightens the ejector button) popped out in my hand.  I could not remove the flash card.

I felt that the Quality control on this product was really bad.  I was really disappointed in Hewlett Packard.
