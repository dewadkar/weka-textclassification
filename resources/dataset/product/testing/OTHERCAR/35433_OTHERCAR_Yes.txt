            I know this car might look silly in America (even though it has been elected car of the year 2002), but this car, as well as its precedent was, is built in Europe and engineered for european roads. The old Mini has never even been sold in America.
But old Mini was "cheap car for students and housewives" and new mini is a status simbol of young dandies that can afford it. Its price tag makes it very expensive toy for its size (specially if you look at size by american eyes). It became a part of people's style and image, and most buyers don't even realize all of its possibilities and capabilities before they buy it. And they are much greater than people think they are.
First, lets look at the driving pleasure. I personally don't own new Mini, but after I have read in several specialized car magazines that people that drive Mini don't get out of it so quickly (people even walk their dogs in Mini), I booked a test drive  at my local dealership. And that was one of  the best drives I have ever had. And I didn't drive the strongest version, Cooper S, but "only" Cooper. With its 115 HP and light body (but rigid construction), acceleration is astonishing as well as driving through curves and serpentines. This feeling can be compared only to go-kart. It does exactly what you want and response is instant, with incredible enjoyment you feel with every second in your Mini.
One thing that might come between Mini and Americans is a manual gear shift. I am not sure if they build Minis with Automatic, but even if they do, think twice before buying it. What's the purpose? Come on, it is not so hard to learn how to use Manual, and the feeling is soooooo much better.
About safety - at least 4 airbags, ABS with CBC and EBD, Automatic stability control and traction, bodywork with extreme torsional and flexional rigidity and many other features. Mini passed Euro NCAP test with 4 stars (out of 5). Car today doesn't have to be big and massive to be safe. Technology makes all the work.
Nobody buys this kind of car to move his house with it or something. Of course you cannot expect a lot of space in a car of this size. 2 people, even with a small children can fit in normally. Luggage space varies between 150 and 670 litres, rear seats can be folded down individually to make room for large loads, and all luggage space is luxuriously carpeted (of course).
At the end, what to say, except, book your test drive even if you are not planning to buy a car of this kind. You will be pleasantly surprised. And if you are buying it, oooh lots of great rides, and congratulate on excellent choice. I am jealous.
While you are at the dealership, look for clothes collection as well. Even if you don't drive it, you can wear Mini. Marketing really is a powerful thing!
