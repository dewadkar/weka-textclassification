                 The Land Rover Discovery truly is the perfect blend of a Hummer and a BMW.  Off-road is a breeze because of standard full-time 4x4, high ground clearance, and a powerful V8.  Yet, the tight and precise drive makes it easily maneuverable in city limits.  BMW currently owns Land Rover, so the interior has all the trimmings and comforts of a luxury sedan.
     There is no better car to drive in the city than the Discovery.  Its height allows the driver full view of the road ahead.  Surprisingly, the Discovery handles quite well in sharp turns despite its height.  Because of its durability bumps and fender benders are not a problem.  The standard model comes nicely equipped with all the necessities and some comforts.  Also, Land Rover is famous for its unique gizmos and gadgets available for a little extra.
     The Discovery does not get good mileage.  The manufacturer says 15-18 city, but city mileage is more like 12.  The V8 engine does burn gas fairly quick and the requirement of high test gasoline can get a little pricey for the 25-gallon tank.  The acceleration is a little poor, but it is after all a SUV not a Porshe.  Finally, the new redesigned 2000 model is expensive, but lower than that of a M-Class or RX400.  
     No matter what, the Discovery is the best looking SUV out there.  A great car to have whether driving to the supermarket or in Colorado's back-country.
