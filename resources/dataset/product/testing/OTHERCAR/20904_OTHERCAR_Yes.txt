            This car has what any dreamer wants.  This is the cheapest almost exotic car in the world.  It has the looks of an old 1930s mobster car with the high side bumper and huge front bumper.  The front looks great and looks as if it's hungrey for road but the back is a turn off.  The small cheap lights in the back really don't help with the buying of your car.
     When I first looked at the car I went to the Chrysler website and checked for the price.  I almost laughed, it was a good joke, but it wasn't.  The 16 thousand dollars was a light slap on the wrist for the modern car prices.  I think that the Chrysler PT Cruiser is a pretty good car if you see it on the road or drive it around, but if you look at the price then it's a great deal.  Thats a lot of car for your buck.  If you want to get looks on the road for a low price then the Chrysler PT Cruiser is the car for you.  My advice, test it out at your local dealer or just go to the Chrysler website to get knocked out of your chair by the price and specs.<br><br>
