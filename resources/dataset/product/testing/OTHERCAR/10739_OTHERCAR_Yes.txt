            My Tribute has everything except for 4 wheel drive and leather and I paid $22,400.  This was the best value I found anywhere and I looked at several SUVs.  I also like the styling over the Escape which is it's sister.

For the first 7000 miles, I found the ride to be rather harsh, almost feeling every bump in the road.  I have now discovered that it is not the Tribute's fault.  It is the Firestone tires that came on it.  These things are as hard as a rock and I dared not to run them at lower pressures. After an altercation with some interstate debris and my front tires, I had to replace them.  I did so with Michelins.  The ride and handling greatly improved.  The road noise has diminished noticeably.  While I found the ride uncomfortable before, now, it is enjoyable.

The gear shift lever on the automatic is about 3 inches too long and interferes with the radio controls. This could
easily be corrected on newer models.

I  received one notice from Mazda about a possible problem with the windshield wiper.  Turns out that it did not effect mine.  Otherwise, no reason to take it back for anything.  Body seems to be tight with no rattles. Everything works as advertised.  With over 8000 miles on it, I remain very well pleased with my decision.
