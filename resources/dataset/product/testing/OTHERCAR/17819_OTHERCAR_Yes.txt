             After seeing one of these cars on the road I wanted to find out more about them.  I learned that it was a true sports car.  No cup holders, or grocery hauling capacity was thought of when designing this car.  That's exactly what I wanted, a fun to drive car so I found one.
 The only thing I dislike at all about this car is the near immposibility of working on a mid-engine car, and the tremendously high labor costs if you don't do the work yourself.  Everything else about the car is exactly what I imagined, the low center of gravity, perfect front/rear weight balance, and mid-engine design make it a fun car to toss around and the turbo helps it hold it's own against some large engined muscle cars.
 This car is obviously not the kind of car you would want if you are interested in luxury, smooth ride quality or driving the kids around.  The car was designed for sport car enthusiasts who enjoy being connected to the road and in complete control.<br><br>
