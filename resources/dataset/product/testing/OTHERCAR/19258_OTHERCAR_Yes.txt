            Ok, I know you're saying FIVE engines?? Let me explain. I love my van, even though it is old. It was only 4 years old when we bought it. It's a 1987 Plymouth Voyager SE. Light Blue with Light Blue interior. Seven passenger, auto, a/c, cassette/am/fm radio, crank out windows, luggage rack.  Oh, and it has a Mitsubishi engine.

Last year, after having almost 130,000 miles on it, my van's engine decided it did NOT want to run anymore. So we went to our NAPA and got a new engine. (my dad is a mechanic and helped my husband install it!) So the engine was installed and running perfect. So we thought. The engine let go within a month of being put in. Come to find out, NAPA's engine had come to use with a remanufactured head that had a crack in it. So, NAPA gets us a replacement.(after a fight of course!!) So, a month goes by, no vehicle to drive. The engine comes and is swapped. The van is driven for about a week and the engine lets go.  **sigh** So, another fight and another month later - another engine goes in. This time the engine actually works (WOO HOO)!! Thus making the five engines it has had in it.

This van has been great! It has rust in a very few places and the interior is still in really great shape. I was asked about a year ago if i wanted to sell it and I said no way! I would recommend this van to anyone!!

It also gets GREAT gas mileage, usually about 22-24 mpg (highway).
