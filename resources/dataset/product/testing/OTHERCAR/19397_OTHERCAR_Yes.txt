            My first comment on the <b>1999 Honda CR-V</b>?  It has more room inside than out.  I really said that.  Out loud.  I don't think I've ever been in a roomier compact model.

My father recently purchased a used <b>1999 Honda CR-V All Wheel Drive</b> and I just spent the last two days running the road in this classy little vehicle.  I am <i>definitely</i> in love with this car and, when you have the occasion to test drive one for yourself, I believe you'll want one, too.

With smooth acceleration and a lot of &quot;get up &amp; go&quot; this sporty 4-cylinder behaves like a machine of much greater power.  It handles the twists &amp; turns of even the most curve-choked country roads with ease and comfort.  Being an all wheel drive, the suspension has a bit more bounce than I'm used to in my Honda Accord LXi but that's okay: the specs are well worth the slight trade-off.  The cruise control was a handy option, too, since I found myself at 60 MPH in a 45 MPH zone but, luckily, I didn't have to utter, &quot;<i>I swear, officer, I didn't know I was going that fast</i>...&quot;  I really <i>didn't</i> know I was going that fast!  Talk about your quiet ride...

Try as I might, I couldn't get my Dear Old Dad to trade his <b>Honda CR-V</b> for my LXi but it wasn't for lack of trying.  The vehicle has so many extras: map lights for the front passengers, a plethora of dashboard compartments for various storage options, an awesome CD player with great sound, <i>five</i> adjustable cup holders (2 in front, 2 in back, and a neat little between-the-front-seats tray with 1 more cup holder for the occasional third back-seat passenger), and easy-to-fold-down back seats to increase rear storage capacity.  That's a plus for gals like me who like to haul home large and interesting articles of furniture from auctions, yard sales, and junque shoppes.

The <b>Honda CR-V</b> also comes with a great design feature - just like my Accord, the driver's side door is only lockable with the ignition key or the slick little electronic case that offers push-button locking/unlocking and tailgate release and because the key is attached to the electronic case, the keys can only be inadvertently left in the car if the driver exits any door besides the driver's side.  Since my dad is usually thinking about fifty things at once, this is a blessing for any future locksmith bills.  Plus, the much appreciated &quot;panic button&quot; is also present on the electronic unit for grabbing big attention if Daddy should feel threatened.  I feel good knowing he has this &quot;alert&quot; option because he lives in a rather large city and is fearless about travelling anywhere in town. 

The color he chose is also my favorite: silvery steel gray.  While I have heard that cars of this color are harder to spot on roads, I say just turn on your headlights when daytime driving and don't even consider another color: the silver tone is the best for always looking clean even when it's covered with road dust.  I know because my Accord is the same color and even when filthy, it's difficult to spot the dirt.

My dad reports excellent mileage: 34 highway, 22 city - a bit less than my car yet very impressive on the wallet for such a good sized vehicle and pretty much in line with other Honda models.  With the price of gas continuing upward, it makes good sense to choose this vehicle for its gas-saving qualities alone but it has much more to offer than just being thrifty at the pumps.

The only complaint I have about this car really is not about the CR-V at all, it's with the manual.  When I opened the book to check some specs, the first few pages had come unbound from the spine.  Shoddy work on the binding &amp; publishing quality but it seems that this is the <i>only</i> place Honda pinched any pennies.  I can live with that.  

So, if you're in the market for a new, &quot;used&quot; vehicle, test drive the <b>1999 Honda CR-V</b>.  I have the feeling that it just may wind up as the newest addition to your garage.  Safe driving and remember to buckle up.


<b><i>AUTHOR'S NOTE</b>: My dad purchased his Honda CR-V with 13,000 miles on the odometer and he Highly Recommends that anyone purchasing a vehicle under warranty should add the Extended Warranty option to their used car package, when available.</i>
