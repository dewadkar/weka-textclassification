            My daughter bought a brand new '96 Saturn SL in '96. She loved it at first, now she loves to hate it.  It started with problems.  Small ones, the door sticking (at the time she lived in North Carolina; air conditioner smelled (they said that it was normal -smelling like mildew is normal?).

The tires would shake, vibrate, and wobble (&quot;just give it an alignment&quot;)-7 alignments in 4years, and still counting! The brakes -so many brakes problems &quot;that's normal&quot;-it is not normal for rotor, pads and everything to go before the car is a year old, and driven carefully and not that much!.

Then the major problems: moon-roof would stick, leak, and now just doesn't work (normal?); complaints of rattles and knocks, were met with (&quot;there's nothing wrong&quot;, &quot;you aren't getting your car serviced regularly&quot; -she was, had the proof of services, then she was told, &quot;well you have to add oil yourself between services&quot; -for a brand new car, not even 14 months old, and less than 2,500 miles on it???; at first the dealerships were nice (not knowing any better we thought they were nice).

But as she kept complaining about the same problems, that they had supposedly fixed and charged her something even though most were supposed to covered by warranty - their attitudes changed.  They even accused her of doing work on the car herself!  And said she had voided her warranty!  She couldn't at that time even change the windshield wipers, let alone try anything to do with an engine!

Well the upshot of the whole case is that the engine is shot.  It seems that coolant leaked into engine (but that was her imagination for six months &quot;cause nothing is wrong!&quot;).  It also leaked onto the batteries (she has purchased 3 in 4 years- including the last a Die-Hard.) And guess what, Saturn has known of the problem for years.  

In fact, they did a recall on the SOC but not on the DOC (this is what my daughter has)- why not? Same problems.  Now they are not returning calls, tell her it is her responsibility, and they are more than rude.  

One other thing, when they tell you something about your car, make sure they write it out on paper!  Or, as they have told me, &quot;you're old, you just don't remember so good!&quot;  The statements listed in this are several service centers in North Carolina and Phoenix, AZ. 

Don't believe me? Here are a few sites that will give you others with the same technical problems, the same disavowance from Saturn, and the same, if not worse treatment for their 'customer service' personnel.  

See: www.lemonaidcars.com; www.saturnexposed.com; www.cartalk.com; saturncomplaints.com; www.webbox.com/business/s/saturn.html; and check out the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration -NHTSA on GM's Saturn.

If you are thinking that Saturn is good looking car, you're right it is. It you are thinking that Saturn is an inexpensive car, you're right - it is cheap.  Should you buy it?  Sure, if you have a lot of money to spend for problems you think are included the warranty-doubletalk, then please be my guest.  But you are trying buy a reliable, economy car - forget the Saturns!
