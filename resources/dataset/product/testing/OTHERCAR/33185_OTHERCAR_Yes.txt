            with a sweet 3.2 v6 vtec motor puting out a stock 290hp with a smooth 6 speed transmisssion,the nsx is a contender with car such as porsche,bmw and many other.Comptech,a company in california make aftermarket performance parts to increase power output for the nsx.adding an intake,header and exhaust you can make power in the 320-330hp range to produce low 13 sec 1/4 mile times.Comptech doesnt stop there either,the can also upgrade suspension,braking and looks.with all the modifications avaliable from comptech you can have a car that acclerates,brakes,handles and almost looks better than a ferrari f355 that cost alot more.believe me,when the rpm's come into the vtec range,hang on.it pulls like it wants to rip your head off.i love the seats,theyre supportive and comfortable,
the gauges look great but rear vision isnt the best though.if you love speed,looks and reliablity this might be the right choice. <br><br>
