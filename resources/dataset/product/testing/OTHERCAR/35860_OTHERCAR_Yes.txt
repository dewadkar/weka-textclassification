            We have had our 1995 chevy Lumina for almost a year now and we love it. It is a very comfortable car and very roomy. Fits our family of 5 great. The radio in it is nice. I love the power windows, and power locks. It has the child safety feature in the back which is nice with 3 kids. We take it on long trips with no problems. It is very easy on gas, if you are not a speed demon. The truck is a very nice size. The heater and air conditioner works wonderful too. I would suggest if you are in the market for a new or used car, you should go look at the chevy lumina.<br><br>
