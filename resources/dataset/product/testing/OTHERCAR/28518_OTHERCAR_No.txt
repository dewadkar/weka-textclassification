            I purchased my Saab 9-3 at about this time last year. It was the first &quot;luxury&quot; car I had ever purchased and understandably I was  a bit nervous. To my surprise the transaction was stress free. The salesperson was very helpful and explained what a fine driving machine I was buying. 
	
For the first month it was all I dreamed it should be. It was comfortable, handled well and yes it was fast. However, then the problems started. First, the passenger seat sliding mechanism broke, at the precise moment I was stopping for a red light, propelling my unsuspecting passenger into the dash. Fortunately, we were going relatively slow and she was not injured. Next, the hatchback would not latch in place, the darn thing bounced back up at me when I attempted to close it. Apparently, the latch became permanently jammed. Then the gear shift became stuck forcing me to use the manual override to shift from park to drive. Next, the front end began making these loud banging noises when I went over the smallest of bumps. As a result, they ended up replacing a great many front end components. (sorry I can�t be more specific). Three weeks ago the temperature control broke off in my hand. Overall the car has been in the shop over 5 times in under a year. Saab doesn�t even seem to care. 

I will never buy a Saab again. I understand that this may not be the norm. In fact my friends swear by their Saabs. But for me the experience has been awful. Will Saab treat you this way? I don�t know. But I wouldn�t give them a chance.  <br><br>
