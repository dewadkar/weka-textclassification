            If you desire a car that caters to all of your needs then the Audi A6 is a sure bet.  Even though not comparable pricewise to the BMW 5 series, or the Mercedes E class, the Audi A6 is still stiff competition for the two. Another thing to keep in mind when trying to select a car in this price range or class, Japanese or American cars do not compete.  European cars are at another level in the automotive industry.

The most popular trimline for the A6 is the 2.8 base.  The 2.8 denotes the 2.8 liter engine with a powerful but refined 200 horsepower.  Five speed automatic transmission is standard and a 5 speed manual is optional.  On all trims tiptronic, the automatic/semi-manual transmission is standard.  It is quite fun to use when on the empty, winding country roads.

Quatrro, the permanent all-wheel drive system, is optional on the 2.8, but 99% of all the dealers order 99% of their cars with the option, so your only option is to factory order if you do not want it.  This should not be a concern though, because on of Audi's greatest achievments is their immaculate all wheel drive system.  The car handles like an SUV in the toughest of winter conditions.  Especially up here in New England, where the winter is always tough.  Quattro is continuosly monitors the grip of the tires, and when loss of traction is detected, the &quot;smart&quot; system automatically transfers all of the power to the tires with the best grip on the road.  You will never be stranded on the side of the road with Audi's superb quattro system.

All of the above resulting in a smooth ride.  The suspension is a little stiff to take the bumps but yet it provides a comfortable ride.  The cabin admits very little noise, especially wind noise, which is due to the excellent aerodynamics.  Dwelling on this for a moment, the exterior styling of the car is first rate; sleek and stylish.  The low curves and sloping rear give it a coupe like look, a sure eye-catcher.

The interior is as well engineered and thought out as the engine and body. Dual automatic climate control is standard, so is a cd player, a great Audi Symphony sound system, and dual 12 way power seats with power lumbar. Among the options is an upgraded Bose sound system with 200 watts, and 12 speakers, a cold weather package which includes ski bag, front and rear heated seats, and heated mirrors.  The two main packages are the preferred and convenience packages.  The preferred includes sunroof, leather, homelink transmitor, and other small items.  The convenience includes sunroof, homelink, steering wheel mounted audio controls, and other small items.  In that package leather must be purchased separately. 

In general the Audi's interior is well appointed, and ergonomically laid out.  All control are easily in reach of the driver and passenger equally. Rear space and comfort is at a maximum with ample leg room, heated seats with the cold weather package, individual headrests, and individually operated lighting.  Rear air vents are also present.  The rear seats fold down to accomodate larger cargo, even though the trunk is a easy loading cavernous space.

The 2.8 is not the only trim, the 2.8 avant (wagon) is available, a great substitute for an SUV.  The 2.7t is the next up on the scale.  This one is a 2.7 liter turbocharged 250 hp engine.  A little more juice than the 2.8. The 4.2 and most expensive A6 has a 3.0 liter, 300 horsepower, V8 engine. This model truly competes with higher end luxury cars.  This engine is found in the most expensive car in the Audi line, the A8.  Aside from a better engine the 4.2 has larger tires, bigger fender and deeper wells. A little more aggressive styling to match the more aggressive engine.

The 2.8 well equipped is around 36-37,000.  Mine is configured with the preferred package, cold weather package, Bose sound system and side air bag curtains.  This configuration totals at 37,000 and change.  The 2.7t starts at 34,480 invoice and the 4.2 at 43,588 invoice.  

Bottom line, the A6 is a tough car to beat, in its price range, out of its price range, and in its class.  Most every respected automotive publication regards it as one of the best luxury sedans.  Consumer Reports, and Car and Driver are just two.  If you are able to buy the car, dont hesitate, you are making a wise decision.<br><br>
