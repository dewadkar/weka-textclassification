            Ever since I started thinking about getting my first car, Jeep Wranglers were in the the front of my mind.  I researched them and found out that there is no better deal around. Once I got mine when I turned 16, I found out that was true.  The Jeep Wrangler 4.0 sport is the best bang for your buck.  It has a powerful 190 hp. 6-cyl. engine, quick off the line but tapers down at higher speeds, keeping the number of tickets to a minimum.  It looks classic with the top on and with it off.....there is nothing else like it.  My friends like it almost as much as I do.  The interior is simple which makes it easy to clean and keep nice.  The back seats are a little small but two large adults will easily fit.  The Jeep Wrangler is the most fun vehicle around.  You and your friends will have a blast!<br><br>
