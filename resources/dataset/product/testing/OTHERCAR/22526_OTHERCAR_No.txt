            I bought my 94 Cavalier Z28 convertible in 1998.  I only bought it with 53,000 miles on it.  The reason I bought it was because the dealership told me an 80 year old man had it before me and took very good care of it. Another reason I bought it was because a good friend of mine sold it to me for a reasonable price.  

I had the car for about a week and started having problems with it.  When ever I would step on the gas it would hesitate like it was going to stall.  I didn't know what was going on.  I called the dealership to have them check it out.  It was a wire in the starter that was shorted.  The dealership made me pay 60.00 for an 8.00 wire I probably could've had someone I know put in.  So that problem was fixed.  

Well for about 2-3 months I had no problems with my car until one day my car did not start.  I had no idea what was wrong with it.  I had someone look at it and told me it was probably the battery.  So I bought a new battery. Problem solved.  

Next, about a month after that I started hearing a loud noise from the driver's side front panel.  It got louder and louder the faster i went.  I brought it to the dealership to have them look at it.  It was a wheel barron (sp) problem.  So they told me I would have to pay for it.  It cost me over 200.00 dollars. 

At this point I was not too happy with the dealership for making me pay for all these problems.  Considering that the car was bought not even 6 months prior to all these inconveniences.  So then my car started making noises from little places.  The roof was squeaking constantly, the dashboard was rattling all the time.  The dealership had to adjust these things for me.  

It is very inconvenient to have to take time out of your busy life for all these little problems that could be avoided if Chevrolet could produce a better vehicle.  They really need to examine each and every car before even thinking of selling it to the public. <br><br>
