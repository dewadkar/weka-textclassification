             I really feel that the Dodge Ram is the absolute best pick-up on the market today. They have a very sporty and stylish look to them as well as being a very tough truck and great for towing. I also feel that it is a good truck for both men and women. Dodge has always been known for having vehicles with high safety standards, and the Ram pick-up definitely follows these standards. There are also so many options and accessories for these trucks it is unreal. When I'm driving this vehicle I feel that it rides as smooth as a Cadillac. The interior is also very comfortable. I would have to say that I love virtually everything about this truck. I bought this vehicle because my best friend bought one and loved his, so I thought I would by one and I don't think I'll ever by another truck that is not a dodge.<br><br>
