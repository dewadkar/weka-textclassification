            <b>Comfort and Amenities:</b>&lt;hr&gt;This is not a cheap car, and thankfully the interior lets you know this.  The previous 3 series was a 1991 design, and you could tell this most easily from the dash: very stark, almost dismal.  The new E46 model is in the same vein as the 5 and, dare I say, 7 series, with an ergonomic feel.  In fact, the stereo and climate controls look like they came out of a 528i (530i now), and shrunk somewhat in the wash.  The feel of the standard &quot;leatherette&quot; (a surprisingly un-Teutonic euphemism for vinyl)is excellent, and all of my passengers believe it to be the real thing, until told otherwise.  The dash has a satisfyingly plush feel (leatherette again), and there is a 2 inch dividing strip (either body colored metal, or burled walnut depending on option package) running along the center, which is attractive to the eye.  This same trim strip is on the doors, and provides a nice departure from BMW's previous monochromatic door skins.  

You get what you pay for in terms of gadgets.  The stereo is very good, but certainly not exceptional: definitely do not bother to specify the Harmon-Kardon, as its benefit is not worth the price - the difference in sound quality is indiscernible to most drivers.  The sound quality could certainly be improved for both the HK and standard systems.  A point of frustration is that it is a) difficult and b) expensive to update the stereo, due to the unique head size, wiring, etc.  Consequently, be prepared to sit in a Honda Civic and find the sound quality to be far superior to that of the 3 series.  I think BMW had an intern spec this system from Alpine.  The interior lighting is the trademark BMW orange/pink, and fortunately it is much more attractive than the garish, Pontiac-like glow of the Audi A4.  The trip computer (an option, again) is useful (ext. temp, mpg, average mph, range).  There are lots of nooks and crannies to store your stuff (again, something new for BMW) and the right wing-mirror will tilt when you engage reverse gear (this is a driver-controlled setting): useful for tight parallel parking).

The vehicle comes with seating permutations: a 6-way manual config, which I have not seen in any car on or off the dealer lot, 8 (or is it 10?)-way adjustable manual seats in the Sport package, 6-way power adjust with memory (Premium pkg) or 8-way power w/ memory (Sport-Premium).  I have the 6-way power, and these are great.  The Sport seats are superior, but the power &amp; memory is great to have.  The car also come with a key-controlled memory feature, programmable at the dealership, which allows one to program the vehicle so that when you unlock the door(s) (key-less entry is standard, of course) the driver's seat returns to your setting, the radio presets are yours, the mirrors adjust, and the DRLs (daytime running lights) are on or off, depending on choice.  A nice touch that is common on new cars over $30k.  Speaking of which, the steering wheel mounted stereo, cruise and telephone controls (again options) is great, esp. for the stereo function: no removing your hand to adjust the volume or change CDs etc.

I could not believe, however, that the 323i does not come with an interior trunk release: was someone smoking something they shouldn't have been?  Don't $8k Daewoos come with these standard?  This, however, is my only gripe about an otherwise flawless interior.

<b>Performance and Handling:</b>&lt;hr&gt;This is why people bought the 3 series previously.  It is an untouchable vehicle in terms of handling feel.  BMW makes every one of its cars, except for the Z3s and X5s, with 50-50 weight distribution between front and rear.  When you combine this with the BMW drivetrain, and short, rear-wheeled drive wheel-base, the combination is wonderful.  This car puts a smile on my face every day.  It is equally at home on the twisties, on the Interstate, and, thanks to the new interior, stuck in traffic, although given a choice, guess where you'd rather be?

The Performance is terrific also.  BMW's ponies seem to have bigger you-know-whats than other marques',and this is evident.  My 323i flies, and it only has 170 hp.  The new 325i and 330i have 185 and 225 hp respectively, so the performance will only be better (torque is not up much in the 325i, as the engine is the same as the 323i).   I dream about the new M3, which will be phenomenal.  The 323 has a terrific quality, in that it feels faster than it is, which is great compared to the alternative, as far as traffic laws are concerned.

I love driving this car.  I cannot stress this enough.  There is no comparison between driving it and the A4, Volvos, Acura 3.2TL and 3.2 CL, etc.  Even the new C-class Merc cannot hold a candle: &quot;the Ultimate Driving Machine&quot; is not hyperbole.  In fact, if you drive the BMW, and then drive another, lesser vehicle, such as those listed, you will immediately notice the difference.  

The body structure is iincredibly stiff also, with little to no flex when driving hard, even over bumpy roads.  The BMW adaptive suspension should be copied by all manufacturers, as it has the perfect balance between firmness (for sporty handling) and plushness (to absorb bumps on even pavement).  

The 3 series has always shined in this category, and continues to do so now.
<b>Safety:</b>&lt;hr&gt;This car feels like it was carved from a solid billet of metal.  It is a new design (1998) and has the most modern crumple-zones, etc.  There are 6 airbags standard (two front, two side, two head), with optional rear sidebags.  Obviously ABS is standard, and the BMW Dynamic Stability Control is here too.  This traction control system senses loss of traction, and applies braking individually to whichever wheel requires it.  There is also a limited slip differential at the rear, which senses a difference in traction between the driving wheels, and locks up the axle to ensure traction at both corners.  This helps people who fear the &quot;demon&quot; of rear-wheel drive, esp. in inclement weather.  The system is also defeatable, for those folks who like a bit of tail-out fun.

A note about rear-wheel drive.  This is not some devilish device.  Things have come a long way since your father's Buick: traction-control and weight bias provide terrific stability.  If you live in a snowy climate, as I do, simply put on four snow tires come winter (approx. $500 incl. wheels) and you'll be fine.  The benefits you get in terms of ride quality and handling are wonderful.  <b>General Comments:</b>&lt;hr&gt;A great vehicle.  The old 3 series was long in the tooth, and had become purely a driver's car, with few creature comforts for today's market.  Now the interior has caught up with the drivetrain, and the combination is unbeatable.  There is no vehicle which can compare with the all-round performance and confort of the 3 series.  The new Lexus IS300 is far off the mark: it looks like a Camry on steroids (esp. from the front) and the interior is way too boy-racerish.  It will stand the test-of-time about as well as platform sneakers.  Plus, it only comes with an auto transmission, which immediately puts it out of the running for most performance enthusiasts.

My 2000 323i is a four-door with black exterior &amp; tan interior and the Premium Pkg.  The sunroof and wood trim are great touches, and the 5 spd manual is a joy to row through the gears.  The Premium pkg offers many luxuries compared to the Sport Pkg, but you do pay almost double the $1500 price asked for the latter.  The Sport pkg gives you uprated wheels and W-rated tires, firmer suspension, 10-way manual sport seats, and foglamps.  The Premium has 16 inch H-rated tires, moonroof, wood trim, cruise control, steering wheel mounted controls, trip computer, upgraded interior lighting, and 6-way power seats w/memory.  There is also a Sport-Premium pkg available, which has the amenities of the Premium pkg, along with the mods of the Sport.  I actually have the best ingredient of the sport package on my car, with Z-rated Bridgestone Turanzas on the BMW sport-package wheels (this was a mistake on BMW's part, as my car came with a Europe-only wheel package).  

The 2001 models are the 325i,325xi (with all-wheel drive), 325ci (coupe), 325 cxi(coupe w/awd), 325ci convertible, 325cxi convertible, and a 325i wagon, also available with awd.  All these versions are available with the 3.o inline-six also (except the wagon).  I haven't driven the awd versions, but if you fear rwd, then here is your model.  I think there is a $1200 premium for the awd option.  I'd stick with rwd, as I am sure BMW introduced this model to woo buyers who chose the Audi A4 solely for this option.

I didn't mention the steering feel.  This is truly a scalpel in a world of steak knives: the car feels like an extension of yourself, as clicheed as that sounds.  This has been a BMW forte for years, and fortunately it has continued into the E46 3 series.  

The car is beautiful also.  I am surprised each time I approach my vehicle, esp. with the front 3/4 view: that fron fascia is so powerful looking.  I originall wanted the coupe, but I an now happier with the 4 doors: either vehicle is easily the best looking in its class.  The only problem is that so many other people think so also, and I see many other E46s around.  

The only problem is the steep price of entry.  The best value vehicles in this segement are the Acura 3.2 TL &amp; CL.  These are very inferior to drive, though, and the interior is again from the Japanese school of soul-lessness.  These are family cars, and not what a sporting driver should drive.  Again, they only come in automatic trans also.  The Is300 is closer to the performance mark, and along with the new Merc C240 (w/manual tranny)are the only real competitors to the 3 series.  The beauty of the 3 series, and the price advantage of the 325i compared the to the C240, keep this car on top of the heap.  I would test-drive these three models if you are a driving enhusiast.  Add the Acuras, A4 and Volvo S60 if you are not.  


I am a true car enthusiast, and I adore this vehicle.  I can see why folks buy a BMW, and never buy anything else, hopefully upgrading through the line.
