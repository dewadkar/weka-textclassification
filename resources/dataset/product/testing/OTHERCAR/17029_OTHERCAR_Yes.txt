            Sure, Durangos look cool and seem like they would be so much fun to drive, but take it from me...it's not worth it! The Dodge Durango gets about as many miles on one tank of gas as my grandfather gets after a meal of bean burritos and no Bean-o(tm). I'm not saying that it isn't a great SUV, I would just like to point out that although the wonderful body and sleek curves are appealing to the eye, much like women, more is put into the vehicle than is recieved. Of course riding the SUV hard is always fun, but the effort needed to get to that point is not worth it. The Durango guzzles gas, lacks many redeeming internal qualities, and basically needs to be designed more like a man than a woman.<br><br>
