            I am 25 years old and my husband and I were getting ready to buy are first car together.  I wanted a sports car and he wanted a big old family car.  We went round and round and looked at a whole lot of different cars, and did a lot of research on the subject of sports cars.  
We finally decided that we would both be happy with a green Prelude (Clearly, I won!) and we have never regretted the decision.  This car is wonderful! It is really fast, but has enough room to move in.  Every thing about this car is perfect.  It gets great gas mileage, it drives very smoothly, we could honestly not be happier.  The only down side to this car is the paint job seems really fragile. <br><br>
