            I have had my camera two weeks and so far I am basically happy with it. Small and light weight, I carry it in my coat pocket. The only negatives I have encountered are short battery life (about 2 hours) and on auto focus when taking a portrait you get red eye quite a bit. I remove the red eye with another software program because the software that comes with the camera does not have that option. Otherwise, the photos are great and the uploading to my PC takes only seconds per picture. Also, it comes with an extra set of batteries and a charger so while one set is in use you can charge the other set. It is great for taking pictures you want to put on the internet or send by email.<br><br>
