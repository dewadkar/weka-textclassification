<TEXT>
            I'm the original owner of a 1998 Nissan Altima GXE and I can say with near certainty that it's the best valued car available.

It has great acceleration despite the lack of a V6. It came stocked with all the needed extras without any unnecessary ones.  The power steering, interior, exterior reshaping, CD player, A/C, etc. are all better than 
expected.  I've put 15,000 miles on it in a year and a half, and it still looks and smells brand new!

I understand that Nissan's recent financial difficulties are partially due to the regularly deep discounts they give consumers who purchase the Altima and Maxima.  I know got $2,000 off the price of mine (not to mention I paid far less than sticker).  Oh well, Nissans follies are our gains!<br><br>
