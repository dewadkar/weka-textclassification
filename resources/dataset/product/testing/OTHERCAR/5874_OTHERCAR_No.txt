            Update 5/2001:
I'm going to have to change my tone a little bit with this update. I've only had the car three years, and it has already been under the wrench four times, one of which was major surgery. 
In the last three years the car has gone though: 
-Front brake pads
-2 Alternators
-Intake Gasket
-Oil sensor switch
-Camshaft sensor
-Parking brake button
This car, that I still have a full year of payments left on before I even own it, has already cost me over $1000 just in repairs. And from what I've been finding out from other members of beretta.net my case isn't exactly unusual.
Yes, the car now has 94,000 miles on it, but I've owned and have known of many, many, many other cars that have had nowhere near this many, or this severe, of problems in that mileage. 
I'll probably keep it because at this point fixing it is still cheaper than buying a new car, but I wouldn't exactly refer to it as "reliable transportation."
[End update]

I actually bought my '96 in summer of '98 - and I've already put over 90,000 miles on this bad-boy. 
The Z26 is great looking, easy on gas as long as you keep it in overdrive, and has a lot of kick for a car I only paid $13K for as a 2-year old car. 
It takes off with a sense of power from a stop light, handles well (in fact the last 3 days I've been driving it through snowy streets that other cars have been fearing without a single slip) and has looks that turns heads (at least here in Oklahoma the Z26 is a fairly rare sight - most Berettas in the area are crappy mis-treated base models).
As far as gripes, my main gripe about the car is that it goes through alternators like a kid going through a pack of candies - in the something-over-two-years I've owned the car I'm already on my third alternator - and from talking to others this appears to be common on this model of car.
And maybe I just got used to smaller cars, but the Z26 feels like it has a huge turning radius, and I usually find myself having to give myself plenty of room when turning into parking spaces.
That aside, I love my car, and I hope to keep it for another 90,000 miles :)
