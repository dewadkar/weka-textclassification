            My first impression of the S2000, as a Miata owner, was &quot;looks like the Miata for twice the price!&quot;  Having also owned a 1990 CRX Si, I decided to give the S2000 a test drive and see how it compared.  At 240 horsepower, redline at 9k and a 6-speed transmission to put the power to the ground, I had very high hopes for this car to tempt me to trade in my Miata.  

The first thing I noticed is that the fit and feel of the car is superb.  The clutch is Honda &quot;smooth as butter&quot; just like my CRX was.  It is simply a beautiful little car.  And little is right.  Interior and trunk space felt familiar after owning a Miata for several years.  The engine is super quiet at idle (a different story at 9k rpm!!).  The button starter is cute and the digital dash looks like an airliner cockpit.  I think I prefer analog, but the winky blinky colorful lights are kind of neat too.  It didn't take me too long to wind this little baby up to redline, as the car salesman's face changed to widened eyes and dropped jaw.  (I am a 33 year old female accountant and looked the part).  This car screams!  Reminded me of my Honda CBR600 motorcycle which redlined just slightly higher.  I have to say, though, that I had hoped for a little more &quot;oomph&quot; (that's a technical term!)  below about 5k rpm.  It really needs to get up there before it generates serious acceleration.  Handling was as good as I have ever experienced.  Not unlike the Toyota MR2's 2nd generation, which is one of the best handling cars I have driven.

Decision:  it's one of the most fun cars I have ever driven.  But, the Miata is probably going to stay in the driveway until I can justify paying almost 40k!!  Even $32k at sticker is kind of shocking, however it's still a lot of fun for the money.  I can't think of much else in that price range that will come close.  And I suppose they will hold their value too well to get a used one in a couple years for much less.  Maybe I'll hold my breath though.
