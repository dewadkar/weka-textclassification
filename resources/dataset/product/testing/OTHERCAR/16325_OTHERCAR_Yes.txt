            I just recently purchased one of these Hewlett Packard cameras, and 
have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since. I have been taking pictures of
everything, but mostly my dog, I even went and bought me another dog to take pictures of. The only thing that bothers me about this camera is how fast it uses up the batteries, I've talked with others who own these
kind of cameras and they all say that the batteries don't last long, but 
I guess I'll just have to stock up on double AA batteries!
I like the ability of this camera to use the high memory flash card,
I bought an additional card to use with it that will store 32 Mb of
data, At the medium resolution it will take over a hundred pictures
before it fills up.  It's also pretty neat to see your picture right
away  on the television screen, you don't have to wait a long time to 
download, you just plug in the cable supplied with the camera into it and the other end into the video in on your T.V. or VCR and there is your 
pictures that you have taken  for everybody to see.
