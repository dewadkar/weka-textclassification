            I own a 2002 CLK 320&#133.purchased it new in February 2002 and have never regretted it for a moment.<p>

I know very little about performance and engines but I do know that this car handles well and can &#147get up and go&#148 fast.  I have caught myself going well in excess of the speed limit with no idea I was driving that fast!  I chose the 320 after I tested the 430 and decided I didn&#146t need that much power.  I&#146ve heard and read where many people complained about the seats on long rides.  The seats aren&#146t as comfortable as a Cadillac but not as rough as a Corvette&#146s.  The seats were brought to my attention before I purchased this car, but I have never had a complaint on them and I have taken this car on many road trips.  This car has everything I need and all the options for this car are available if you are willing to spend the money.  Basics such as CD changer are going to cost extra&#133it just depends on what you think you can and cannot live without.  <p>

The service at my local Mercedes Dealership is excellent.  The car tells me when I need to have the oil change, I take it in&#133.they change it, check everything out and even clean it up for me.  The only complaint I have ever had about the car is the design of the cup holder isn&#146t the most &#147user friendly&#148 for me.  Mine broke with in 5 months but the dealership replaced it with no questions asked.<p>

I completely love my car and enjoy driving it.  I can&#146t think of another car on the road today that I would rather drive.  It&#146s a joy and an experience to own and drive my CLK 320.
