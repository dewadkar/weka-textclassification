            I'm not the type to carry around a big camera, case, extra film, flash attachments, etc.  I don't like lugging around anything at all, actually.  This camera is perfect for me because it fits in my pocket and there's no extra pieces to carry around.  It's a little heavy, but it's made of metal, so that's to be expected.  

I paid $500 for my Digital Elph and I have to say that it was well worth the price.  I really really love this camera.  Yes, $500 is a lot to spend on a camera.  There are several cheaper digital cameras on the market.  However, I feel that the Digital Elph offers so much more than these other cameras.  For one, what other camera looks as cool as this one?  It's made of metal and looks like something straight out of a Bond film.  On top of that, it has an LCD screen that lets you view the pictures as soon as you take them.  You can delete the ones you don't want right away instead of waiting until you upload the photos on your computer.  To me, this is very important.  

I can use this camera one handed.  I have an 8 month old daughter and that's a very important feature for me.  Also, a digital camera is great for anyone with a child because you're not constantly running out to develop your film.  Right now I have about 15 rolls of film waiting to be developed.  

I print a lot of pictures from this camera and the quality is wonderful!  Most of them are better than photos taken with a regular 35mm camera.  Plus, you get the photos as soon as you print them, there's no waiting for developing.

If you are looking for a great, easy to use digital camera, this is the one for you.  Canon is a great brand to buy, even if the price is higher than other brands.
