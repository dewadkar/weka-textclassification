            I took my 1994 Pathfinder to the Nissan dealer last week for regular maintenance. The service manager asked, &quot;When was your last tune up?&quot;  &quot;Never!&quot; I said.  It took 120,000 miles before my sassy but tough Pathfinder needed a tune up.  I've changed oil every 3,000 miles, replaced an alternator and the brakes, and replaced tires twice.  That's it.  Five years and 120,000 miles have cost me about $1,5000 TOTAL in maintenance and repairs.  Let me point out that all four of my children learned to drive &quot;stick&quot; on my Pathfinder.... and she's still on the original clutch.  I think this is some kind of record.  120,000 miles AND 4 teenagers:  WOW!  I'd buy a new Pathfinder in a heartbeat...but I think I'll take this one to 200,000 miles.  When you've got a good one, why trade?<br><br>
