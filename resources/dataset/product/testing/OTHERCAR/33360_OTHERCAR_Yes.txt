            Is it an urban myth that only girls drive Jettas? Here is my Reasons for Buying List. Ode, or evidence? You decide.

<b>The Top Ten Reasons for Buying a 2000 Jetta</b>

10) <b>Information.</b> As the honorary car of the Internet generation, Jettas are easy to research before purchasing. Maybe this fact speaks more to my impulsiveness than my research abilities, but I only stepped onto the lot ONCE . . . and that was to pay and drive away. 

9) <b>VW Financing.</b> Now, when I say "pay", I mean that I showed up with a hefty promissory note in hand. I was prepared to begin my indentured servitude to USAA (highlighted on Quicken.com as having the second-best auto loan rates in the country), until I stepped into the VW Financing office. They beat the USAA rate by an entire percentage point!

8) <b>Perkiness.</b> One of my friends said, "Oh, the 2000 Jetta . . . those are the cars with the perky butts, right?" It's true. The 2000 design is so cute that you want to pinch it.

7) <b>Stick zip.</b> The Jetta's got tang like a Dorito, but without the toxins. Can you believe that the sales rep actually <i>talked me out of the V6</i>, saying that a manual transmission would give me all the acceleration and control I needed? No upsell? Now THAT'S a switch. 

6) <b>Disneyworld.</b> As I was signing a bunch of dotted lines, Bruce, the VW finance guy, said, "Have you seen the lights yet?" He was referring to the console, which has such a beautiful color schema that he sometimes lights it up for his kids when they come to visit him in the dealership. The speedometer, gas gauge, and other things you need to monitor are all iris blue; other controls are firebrand red; and the signals are a glorious goldenrod. It's a primary color party in there!

5) <b>I have to be truthful here.</b> This is my first new car, so I'm a little biased, in case you haven't noticed.

4) <b>Warranty.</b> According to Bruce, Volkswagon's warranty is far more comprehensive than most companies' offerings. Not having done my warranty research ahead of time, I signed up for the max (gulp--perhaps you will learn from my potential mistake), but I feel confident that it's a good deal. Tchotchke Affirmation: they gave me the warranty agreement and manual in a cute leather organizer.

3) <b>Cramps.</b> Sure, lots of cars have heated seats. But the Jetta takes your lower back in its arms -- I mean, cushions -- and gives you a good warming. Nothing more soothing during a heinous commute from the South Bay.

2) <b>Leather.</b> Try to spring for the luxury package, if you can. Not only will it facilitate rump warming, but it also looks great.

1) <b>Advertising.</b> Let's just say that they finally wore me down. If I didn't get the Jetta, I probably would have gone out and bought an Imac or some other silly thing. Since I didn't need a computer, purchasing a Jetta seemed like a proper concession for a twentysomething to make. 

Ah, Jetta love. Mine was so intense, I had to sign on for a major charity event to assuage my guilt for falling in love with an inanimate object. 

If this acquisitional trend continues (see StarTac review and Palm V review [coming soon]), I might be named Capitalist of the Year and start voting Republican.
