            I bought myself a 2000 Eclipse as a graduation gift in January of 2000.  I've been happy with this car 99.9% of the time!  I didn't know how I was going to like driving it at first because the model I bought was fitted with a manual transmission (I had only driven automatics to that point) but I was determined to drive it!  Now I don't know how I ever lived without driving stick!  The GS model that I have is totally fun to drive and I get lots of great comments from people that like the car.  Since I've had the car, I've only had one problem with it.  A little tin Eclipse logo that sits near the floor board came unglued on the passenger side!  Not too bad I guess!  If you're looking for a fuel efficient sports car, then this car is definitely for you.  I get about 30MPG on the highway and slightly less in the city.  In my opinion, I think 20 somethings are the group that would like this car the most.  Although I say that, my dad who's 50 loves driving it when he gets the chance too!  So I guess this car would work for people of all ages!<br><br>
