            The Polaroid PDC 640 is a great camera for young children, beginners, and people with limited technical or computer literacy.  It is one of the most inexpensive digital cameras available.  The price along with the simplicity of this model make it the ideal camera to learn with.  Another good quality is the accessories that come with the 640.  You get the camera, a 2MB SmartMedia memory card, 4 AA batteries, serial cable(used to transfer pictures to your computer), video cable(used to view your pictures on a television), power adapter, PhotoMAX software package and a nice leather case.

Now for the not so great aspects of the 640.  Powering this camera with batteries(4-AA's) can become fairly expensive due to the speed at which it drains them.  Rechargeable batteries would be a smart investment if you plan on buying or own this camera.  The 2MB of memory only allows 12 pictures when using the so called best(640x480 pixels) quality picture setting.  Although, 8MB and 16MB memory cards are available.  The large size and weight of the 640 make it bulky and a pain to transport.  There is no zoom and the picture quality is definitely representative of a low priced camera.  Another downfall of this camera is the outdated software that will most likely stay outdated since Polaroid no longer produces digital cameras.
