            I scoured the Southern California region for a camera watch. I had thought of the thousands of uses for it. Eventually, I found one at a Sears, they didn't even know they had it! When I got it, I was impressed with the camera functions of it, the aperture was decent and the refresh on the screen was remarkable.

I believe it's a 16-grayscale mode, and you can tell what the pictures are when you look at the screen. Although withen a few days of getting it (after recv. a new battery) the battery died. I understand it was because I had used the camera function an awful lot, but what else are you supposed to do with it? :)

As I was taking pictures of my girlfriend (don't get ahead of me guys), I noticed that unless you have the camera directly under you, there's really no way to see the image. If you view the screen from any other angle, it's very difficult. 

What I thought was cool was the USB IR link that came with it, although the software is a bit buggy. Infact, to date, I have not gotten my watch to link to anything. It's been about 2 weeks, and it won't talk to any computers (tried 4 with diff. OSs) also, I D/Led the software for my Sony Clie to view the pictures from my watch (that would of been cool) that didn't work either. Like I stated earlier, there is very little support for this. Just search in Yahoo and see what you get. I still live in a grayscale world.

It's relatively bulky, although that was to be expected. The clock time is very.. very.. very.. bland. The chrono isn't very persice, it only counts tenths of a second. The calendar is very is pretty slick, but it's a very only thing. 

<b>On the small things (which do make the difference):</b>
-The plastic band is very cheap, but I understand there is a metal banded one. 

-No backlight/indiglo.

-The shutter button is difficult to push down, and you almost need to put another finger under the watch to support it.

-I do have to say the LCD on the watch generates fairly good images, even in thumbnail view. Although the images are about the size of a pencil eraser, it's still recognizable.

-You can also name your pictures, and it does let you change the contrast of them asfter you take them. I don't do the naming thing: 
A-B-C-<b>D</b> 
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-<b>O</b> 
A-B-C-D-E-F-<b>G</b>

-From what I understand you can also beam to other watches. Most stores don't have these, also, I heard from a few sources, that the watch is no longer in production, so best of luck finding someone else with one.

-Something I found pretty funny was the way the battery is replaced. It's this huge plastic ring/gasket on the back, so it's very easy to change the battery (wonder why :)

In conclusion, casio has a new watch on the market that has a color screen, and if you have to get a camera watch, I would full-heartedly suggest waiting for the big one. I'm taking mine back today.
