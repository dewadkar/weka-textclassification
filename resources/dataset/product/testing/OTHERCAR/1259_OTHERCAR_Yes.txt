            Nikon Coolpix 990 
I do not recommend this product.

<b> RED EYE TROUBLE</b>
If you should take indoor pictures where you have to use the auto flash with the red eye reduction feature, you will be in for a big-big surprise. This camera is NOT to be used with the included flash. You will get redeye every time. The red-eye reduction option does not work. The red eye reduction feature is horrible , however under controlled or ideal lighting conditions gives very sharp detailed photos. It can't take quality pictures in low light settings.  

<b> Not Easy to use </b>
Very complicated operations personally i would not recomend to someone new to digital cameras.  Feature overload. 

<b> Sub-Par Tech support </b>
Nikon has horrible tech support. Called for help on the weekend at an off hour time- waited over 2 hours for a customer service rep to pick up.
 
<b> Questionable Software Support </b>
CoolPix 990 may not work with WindowsME - Need special drivers?
The camera says it is compatible with Windows 95 and comes with a USB cable - Check what version of Windows you have. Older Version of windows does not have USB Support.
It was a real hassle to install the software. 

<b> You have to pay for Serial Cable! </b>
Optional serial cable available (as opposed to the included USB cable). What they don't tell you is that they charge $30 for it, in addition to a wholly gratuitous $7 service charge.

Check out my website and Profile.  Good Luck finding a Digital Camera!
