            I saw this little honey in the James Bond movie and it didn't need Pierce Brosnan at the wheel it to make it attractive.  My husband surprised me with my own little roadster nearly a year later.  I try to be a practical person and this was the farthest thing from practical that I could think of.  When I saw it in the movie it was a real eye catcher, but would I really like to own one.  

I've had my little roadster for almost 3 years now, so I feel qualified to offer my observations.  The extra ordinary good looks of this car, in my opinion, make it a better value than the higher-dollar comparative cars. It has more leg room than I would have expected, my husband is 6' and it's comfortable for him to drive.  

My car came with a few extras that arn't standard.  I have a feature that gives you the average miles an hour, miles until empty, temp outside, etc..I don't use this!  But, the heated seats are a must!  We can put the top down in the winter, as long as its not raining, and you still are warm.  The driver and passenger have their own controls.  The only 2 things I wish my car had are: a door remote and I wish you could open the trunk from inside the car.
