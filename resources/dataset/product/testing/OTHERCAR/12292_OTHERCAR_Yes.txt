            The new 2000 Eclipse GT is a great car for a younger person.  It's body style say's &quot; look at me.&quot;  The interior is very convenient and roomy.  The sound system is absolutely wonderful. 
I purchased this car when a special program was going on. No payments or intrest till 2001.There were not any gimics like most people would think there would be.  It's really helped me save money this year.
The thing I like most about my car would have to be the sunroof and the 205 horsepower.  I can barely touch the accelerator and it feels as if I am taking off in a jet plane.  The sunroof adds a bit of luxury to the car.  I wanted something that didn't feel so closed in.  That's exactly what I got.  Another neat option I have is the sportstronic shift.  It is both an automatic and manual in one.  This is great if you have a boyfriend that likes to drive a five speed and you want an automatic.
Another great advantage on the Eclipse is the very roomy trunk.  I can fit a lot of shopping bags in it!  There really isn't one thing I do not like on my car.  I recommend this car for college students who like flashy, but dependable vehicles.<br><br>
