            I rented a Saab 9-5 recently and  was duly impressed. The speed and ease of performance was impressive. The overall features were well laid out on the dash  and the gas mileage was 24.3 mpg.  I liked that the heating system and outlets for the heater were such that they could be easily directed, without blow drying your hair.  Of course, I rented the car in Louisiana, so there was not much use for the seat heaters, however, in the dead of a New England winter, I know that they would be much appreciated.
The leg room was very good since it extended far into the engine part of the vehicle and there was good space in the front seat, however, the back was the usual for smaller cars, nice for putting your stuff, not so nice for getting in and out of.
The guy at the rental place said to watch out on the highway and sure enough, thinking I was doing 55- I was cruising at 82!!! This car gave no evidence of the speed at which it moved. It simply took the road and rammed hard.
The overall body styling is sleek and cool looking. The design is aerodynamic and the inside roominess is  impressive.
One of the problems I had with this car since it was a rental, was finding where to put the key for the ignition. It was hard for me to remember that the ignition is located on the console below the shift. It is not a bad place once you establish that in your mind, however, you never traditionally look there to put the key and I would wander, key in hand, until I ultimately found the little position for it.
The cargo area was less than I expected, however, it was adequate to meet the needs of a weekend jaunt. For the size of the vehicle, it was well done. I also liked the pull over shelf that came over what was in the cargo space to ensure that it was not able to be openly viewed by anyone walking by.
This car was actually fun to drive. It seemed to move with such agility and grace. Turning was another impressive feature.  Several times, I found myself turning it in a space that was half of what my Jeep would have required.
I have been a Jeep owner for over 11 years and am committed to my brand, however, I might consider one of these, since it handled so well. 
I rent cars perhaps 20-25 times a year and  this was a delightful surprise as a rental and a great chance to use a vehicle I may consider as a future purchase.
