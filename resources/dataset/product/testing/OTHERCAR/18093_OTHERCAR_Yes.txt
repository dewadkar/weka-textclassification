            We have a 96 Neon 2-door coupe which we purchased brand new for $10,300.
Although my husband drives it most of the time, I can tell you it is definitely a dependable little car. It is great on gas mileage and takes about $10 to fill up. The A/C will freeze you out even when its on low. The only problem we have had with it so far is having to replace the oil pan gasket (which was covered under warranty) I also don't like the way the driver's side seatbelt cuts into your neck. I guess it depends on your height but it tends to get very uncomfortable after a while. Being only two doors also makes it more difficult to get a 3 year old in and out of a carseat. Overall we are very pleased with it (although I'm sure my husband would rather be driving a Mustang GT). I would not get black again because it shows every little ding and scratch and you have to dry it really fast after you wash it otherwise you can see every little water spot.<br><br>
