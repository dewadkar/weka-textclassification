            I love the Cavalier that I have. I bought my 1996 2 door Cavalier Coupe about a year ago and it has ran great ever since I bought it. The only time that it has ever had to be in the repair shop is to get its oil changed.

I really like the way that the Cavaliers look they are very sporty looking and they are a great bargain. They are probably the cheapest car that you can buy with standard anti-lock brakes, cruise control, automatic locks and windows. 

So if you want to purchase a cheap car that is very sporty looking and that runs great then the Chevy Cavalier is for sure that car that you should buy.<br><br>
