            The SUV bug bit me in 1996 and since we buy mostly Chevrolet's, we chose the Blazer: 4-door, 4-wheel drive, fully loaded, $28,500.  At first I thought it was great.  We live in on a hill in SW Pennsylvania and usually get several snow falls and ice storms per year.  The 4-wheel drive on the fly was great (still is, my new truck has it also).  In 1998, I had 35,000 miles on the Blazer and it was making funny noises in the rear housing.  I took it to a dealer to have it checked.  They said they couldn't find anything wrong.  Well, they were sorely mistaken.  Four days later, I took it to the store 3 miles away from my house with my pregnant daughter-in-law and the rear axle fell off.  As in, it passed me on the road.  As in, both rear wheels, attached to half the axle rolling past me.  The rear of the Blazer obviously dropped to the ground, but I had a hitch on and it was actually riding on the hitch.  Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the left axle did hit an oncoming car as it traveled past me.  

Well, I had it towed to the dealer and dumped in front of the service door (it was a Sunday).  The tow truck driver could only load it by sticking the axles back into the housing, so when the dealer decided to work on it on Monday, they just assumed it had an intact axle and wrecked it again when they turned in the lot!  Duh...

GMC contacted me the next day and said I needed to sign a waiver before they would pay the repairs which I thought was very arrogant.  I ended up signing it and getting it repaired, but I never resumed possession of the Blazer.  I told them if I can't even count on having wheels on the vehicle, why take a chance on driving it?

The sad fact is that it was probably just a lemon and others are safe, but I never want to take a chance like that again.  Especially with my children.
