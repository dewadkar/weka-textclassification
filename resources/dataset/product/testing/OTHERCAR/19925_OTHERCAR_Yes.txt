            Although this section is for the 2000, I am writing about the 2001.

Having a long love of classic British cars, I surprised myself by buying a new Jaguar S Type. I must admit I did not set out to purchase a Jaguar. My focus was on the new C Class Mercedes or BMW 325/330 series. After seeing the Mercedes and BMWï¿½s up close, they appeared small in both the interior and exterior. Once adding the basic options that were of interest the price was around $40,000. At that point I decided to look at the Jaguar S Type, I am glad I did!

The Jaguar S Type is very impressive. The basic options cover everything I wanted except a sunroof. The car I drove and purchased had only the sunroof option. The car handles like a sports car, rides like a luxury sedan and has the power of a muscle car but somehow still has a feel of the old classic British cars. The ride is extremely quiet and mildly soft. The interior is roomy, I'm very tall and can stretch out in both leg and head room. The V6 240 horse power is just right for this size car. It is responsive, quiet and with the 5 speed automatic the gas mileage is respectable.

Overall I am extremely pleased with the value and quality received. If there was one area I am slightly disappointed in is the sound system. First I would have expected a sound system that would beat any standard American car. At best, it is only as good. And second, I would have expected a CD player as standard. Most American cars now have AM/FM/CD as standard features. Based on the price of the car, I would have thought these two issues to be of no concern.
