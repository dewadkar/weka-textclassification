            Can an automobile have it all?  
�	Style
�	Sporty Good Looks
�	Ample power
�	Good Gas mileage
�	Affordable Price
�	Dependability

If so, then that automobile would have to be the 2000 Honda Accord  LX.  

From the time I first saw this car I was in love.  The coup body styling has a neat wedge shape.  I can barley see the nose from the cockpit, yet the trunk is very high up, almost like the rear end is �jacked up� from the factory.  Notice how I said cockpit,  I said that on purpose because I feel like I am fling a plane, the cab truly looks and feels like a cockpit.  The exterior fit &amp; finish, like all Honda�s, is above average, it is especially close in the trunk area.  The head lights are especially bright and cast a wide angle, even in �low beam� mode.  I live in the country where street lights are a rarity, this feature is a pleasant surprise.  Overall, I would have to give the exterior an 8 out of 10.  I really think Honda should have given it the 16� wheels that it�s EX V6 cousin has.  I also did not like the front license plate area; it looks cheap, awkward and looks like it was just an after thought.

The interior is where this car shines.  The cab feels wide and spacious, the front seats are ample; you can fit 3 adults comfortably in the rear.  The driver seat is a  6-way manual adjustment, it is a bit of a pain to turn and crank the knobs, this should have been electric.
The gauge area is well laid out and in a logical format, I really enjoy the combination of digital and analog gauges.  The climate audio controls are naturally located in the center of the dashboard, well within reach of both the driver and the passenger.  The climate controls have large buttons and are well marked, a driver safety benefit.
The stick shift is close to the driver and the gears are tight, making shifting a breeze, even during high RPM, no �hurky jurky� shifts here folks.  The 6 speaker audio system is nice, although even after numerous adjustments, it still sounds a pinch flat.  The center console is huge, more then big enough to stuff lots of extra CD�s for a long trip, but that is also the interior�s largest weakness, it is too tall.  For me, I have to sit up as straight as possible to have my elbow/arm rest on, for my wife, she can not rest her arm on it at all, meaning the stick shift a pinch awkward to reach.  Overall I would have to give the interior a 9 out of 10, the only thing that keeps me from giving it a full 10 is the center console.  If you are any shorter then 5� 10�, you will really have a hard time with this.

As for handling,  I am still in the break in period, so I have not been able to open her up yet, but there is more then enough  power when I need to pass.  Steering is good, you have to slightly under steer during cornering which took me a while to get used to.  The breaks are not too bad, but are a tad on the mushy side if you do not properly down shift during deceleration. I can not rate this area until I can properly test it.

On a whole, the base LX is nice.  I originally wanted the EX 4 but was unable to get one this late in the year, so I basically built one, minus the leather.  Living in a cold country like Canada, that could be a good thing.  I added the power sunroof, CD player, mats ect, but the one thing that makes this sporty car stand out is the fin.  On the other hand, with all the extras I added, I bought the EX 4 but did not get a few of the extra goodies.


I high recommend this car for anyone; I give the whole car a 9 out of 10
