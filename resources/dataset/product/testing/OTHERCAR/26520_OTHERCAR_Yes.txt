            As a staunch opponent of the &quot;I'm-just-a-suburbanite-but-I-need-a-SUV-that-I'll-never-really-use&quot; craze I didn't expect too much out my family's new lease S10 pickup.  It's a droopy-looking pickup and the color is the same as on innumerable plain-looking Camrys and Accords.  Inside is lots of grey plastic, although the visibility is excellent.  And with a 4-cylinder, manual, extended cab P/U, how much fun can possibly have with it?  The answer: more than you might think.  You see, this truck doesn't make much power.  Only about 120 horses, give or take.  But what is there the manual will let you hold on to desperately.  Add the benefits of having: a stick shift, rear wheel drive, skinny, grip deficient tires, and no weight over the rear end and what you have, my friend, is one truck that manages to have fun.  This thing is so easy to powerslide it's not even funny.  Just hang the tail out a tad, add a little opposite lock, and then you'll be all straightened out.  In addition its unassuming looks and unexciting color make for one hell of a stealth vehicle.  But wait, there's more!  Hauling utility is excellent.  By my count I fit 40 bags of mulch, 14 2x4s, and one leaf blower in with room to spare.  This is in addition to the fairly generous extended cab, which can hold at least 2 large golf bags.  Don't be fooled into thinking that little jumpseat will hold anything larger than a large rodent, though.  Only a few drawbacks.  Wheezy engine (sounds like a broken coffee grinder), not a great handler and/or braker, and the rides a tad rough.  However after considering that the S10 is as cheap as it is I guess there's no room to complain, really.  I mean $11,000?  That's dirt cheap.<br><br>
