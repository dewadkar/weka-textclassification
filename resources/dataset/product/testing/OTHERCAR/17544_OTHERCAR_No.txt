            This is a Long term test of the 1991 Jeep Wrangler &quot;S&quot; Hardtop 4 cyl. 5 speed transmission.
I bought it brand spanking new in the fall of 1990 for $12,750 US dollars.
I thought it was the greatest SUV ever until the problems started following.  After about 5 months of driving the vehicle, I started receiving letters from Crysler Corp. on recall notices. I must of received around 2 dozen in the past 10 years, everything from the front brakes, to Gas tank &quot;O&quot; ring seals and so on.  It was a pain taking my Loved Jeep to the Dealer and waiting all day until they give you a call. Anyone who buys a car or truck and has to take it to the dealer knows it usually take too much time there.
Everything was fine with the Jeep until about 3 years into the life of the Jeep. The first problem I started getting with the Transmission.The 5th gear was making noise.  Took it to the Dealer and they told me that the warranty was past the 36 month term so I was screwed.
Then after a few months later, first gear started making noise and then about 1 year after that 2nd gear made a noise also. All in all, the only gear that didn't make any noises was the 4th gear.
4 years into my purchase, the gas tank leaked! I couldn't put more than $5.00 dollars of gas into the Jeep since it would spill out.
A few months later, the rear Shock Tower on the passenger side broke from the axle. 5 Years into the life of the Jeep, the passenger seat broke!
The metal holding the reclining seat actually broke in 2.  Oh! I forgot to mention that the Vacumn actuator on top of the Transfer case that controlled the engagement of the front axles into 4 wheel drive had gone bad. That was after 2 years of use. I replaced the unit myself 3 times and as the Jeep sits out in my driveway it still needs another vacumn actuator replaced!

The ride on the Wrangler is left to be desired since your always bouncing up and down from any bumps on the road. Small or large doesn't matter, its a constent harsh ride.
The wind and road noise is the worst! I bought a after market soft top from Best Top Co. and it is a joke! You cannot even hear your own stock radio from all the road noise!  If you upgrade your sound system which is usually a good/bad option to do. The good is that you can now hear the music over the road noise, the bad is your always having to worry about theft. Which on the Wrangler is one of the easiest to break into.
The windshield is one of the first visual parts to go. Because of the flat windshield, chances of the glass breaking from rocks and stones are very high! 
The 4 cyl. Engine is good. Its solid and has enough torque to do the job.
If you add Larger Tires (31&quot;) going up large hills will strain your 4 cyl. The styling of the Wrangler will never go out of style.
Its a must for people who live in tight, hard to park cities. The turning radius is supurb. I believe 15 feet turning radius which is one of the best. If you like to use your Wrangler for off roading, DON'T! Its really a very poor off road vehicle. You need to add too many modifications to make it off-road worthy. Make sure you purchase a Winch since you WILL definately need one with a Wrangler.
