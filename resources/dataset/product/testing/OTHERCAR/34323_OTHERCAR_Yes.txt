            Ok Gang:  I was one of the first owners of this model when it came out in Sept '99.  It was almost as if Honda of America knew what I needed and when- and did they deliver.  So what am I talking about?  Well, I owned my first Honda, an '80 Prelude when you had to wait 3 months-- and it blew its carbeuration after 25,000 miles-- at that time a $287 repair. Honda decided it should not have happened, even outside of warranty, and picked it up gratis.     A grateful med student at the time I have been a life ever since.  The Acura 3.2TL is my seventh Honda- and as usual, has been a flawless masterpiece of engineering.

It takes the Honda Accord and basically adds some steroids!!  Very luxurious on the inside, it packs a 225 hp engine, very smooth transmission, great and large Michelin tires, just right acceleration and smooth responsive handling.  They loaded it up with Xenon headlights (teh best- and the ones that the other &quot;luxury&quot; competitors have just discovered a year later. There is a CD player standard, the usual elegant moonroof which Honda mastered 20 years ago, electric everything standard, great climate control.  IN fact, the only add-on for me was the amazing and still amazing Alpine designed GPS navigation system- for an additional $1500, the car still cost me just under $30K-- talk about grand theft auto!!

What can I say, it never breaks down, you change the oil every 3 thousand miles, give the guys at Acura a break every 15K for routine and often needless service rip-offs, and away you go.  I don't even look at GM, Ford or Chrysler- why bother!  Now, if I can only talk myself into the 3.5 RL soon.....<br><br>
