            I bought my 99 Accord LX Sedan after spending nearly two months online and offline researching various mid-size cars. I am very glad that I bought this car, which has been giving me excellent service for the past two years and 35000 miles it has been through. Apart from a feeling that you have bought a time tested, sturdy and reliable car, you will also appreciate the roomy interiors, the various stow-away places (you will be surprised at how much you will find in your car when you try to clear it of all the accumulated stuff), easy handling, good brakes, peppy engine (even for a V4) and mileage. I consistently get 29 mpg on the Garden State Parkway, which is worse than city roads on most occasions. The car handles very good at high speeds and is less noisy once you cross the 40 mph barrier, but it does tend to make some noise at low speeds. My car did not come with a factory installed keyless entry system, so I had the dealer install one. This has been a mistake. I had to go twice to them to get the remotes replaced after their buttons stopped working. Honda gives very little with its LX model. While smaller and cheaper models offer CD, Honda charges a hefty $400 to install an old outdated OEM unit. I replaced the entire audio system with a third-party three-in-one and it works like a charm. I wish they could make ABS standard on their Accord lineup. I have been noticing recently that the driver side door has been making funny squeaky noises and there is a sound of air hissing into the car through the edges even with moderate wind. I hope to get it fixed before my extended warranty expires. I also wish the rear seats were 60/40 instead of full-folding so that I keep some stuff in the back without worrying about kicking the third passenger out. Day-tme running lights are missing in this model. Honda has done well with this car, but they need to constantly innovate and improve if they want to keep their lead in the mid-size car segment. The car has seen very little change in the four recent models (1998 thru 2001).<br><br>
