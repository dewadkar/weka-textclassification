            Recently had to make the very tough decision of what car to buy.  After looking at most of the cars on the market, I settled on a new 2000 BMW 323i with the premium package and leather seats.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The car is a joy to drive.  I had originally looked at the pre-2000 328 and was disappointed with the quality of the interiors.  However, the 323 and 2000 328 interiors are markedly improved and are truly luxurious.  My only qualm is very slight.  The 323 lacks an interior trunk release.  Minor, but annoying.  Another problem is the integrated cell phone system.  Although conceptually nice, it requires the use of the BMW analog phone, which the dealer informed me has awful reception and is disturbingly expensive.  So that nice feature is of no use.  If I were to repeat the purchase, I would certainly buy the same car but would probably also get the Harmon-Kardon sound system since the factory stereo is good but not great.  Overall, great car!<br><br>
