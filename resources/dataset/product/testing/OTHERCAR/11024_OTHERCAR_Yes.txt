            My husband and I purchased our 1997 Chevrolet Astro in 1999. In my opinion it was the smartest thing we ever did, I Love it!!  

We have 4 children and 3 of them are boys.  I knew that with the boys and the fact that my husband is 6ft. 2 inches tall, we would need a roomy van.  I have all the room I could ever ask for in this van plus it really has been a dependable choice.  The luggage rack on the top is also an added plus not to mention the seats fold down very easy and also are very easy to remove even without the help of my husband.

The power of this van is another plus for me.  The 6 horses under the hood are more then enough for anything I have came in contact with.  It gets up and goes without any delay.  

The only draw back that I have found is that it does not handle that well in snow.  The back end is very light so when it is snowing or ice out, I put sand bags in the back end.

I really love this van and would highly recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
