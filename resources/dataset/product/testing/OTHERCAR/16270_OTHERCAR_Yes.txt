            My grandmother leased a '99 corolla when the lease on her nissan altima ran out.  I do most of the driving around for her and in the corolla it is a pleasure.

The engine puts out impressive performance for a little four banger with an automatic.  It easily keeps up with traffic on the streets and does pretty ok for itself even on the highway (with a/c running too).  It gets excellent fuel economy as a bonus too.

The ride is unparalleled....we test drove cavaliers, escorts/tracers, civics, sentras, etc. and nothing came close to the serene ride and superb noise dampening this car provides.  I know this sounds corny, but like they say, &quot;drive the rest, then drive the best&quot;.  You WILL notice a big difference.  The salesman practically challenged us to test drive it over a road notorious for potholes.  To keep it to the point,  I was immediately won over.

The front seats are very comfortable, but people at or above six feet tall might feel cramped (also portly persons may find the bucket seats somewhat tight).   The rear seats are best left to persons under the age of 13.

Controls follow the K.I.S.S. principle:  Keep it simple, stupid.  They're very simple and logically placed.  My gripes:  a weak radio and sissy sounding horn (don't bet on anybody actually hearing it).

In summary:  if you want the Lexus of economy cars, then the corolla is your best choice.<br><br>
