              Got my first Mopar a few months back, a 1994 Dodge Spirit 4door with a V6.  I would have preferred something like a 1965 Coronet with a V8-but that wouldn't have been anywhere near as practical.  This car was bought for daily commutes to and from school and fairly regular trips to and from the parents' house, about 100 miles away.  The goal was to get a car that would be practical in every respect: big enough to carry luggage or some friends but small enough to fit in crowded parking lots, good gas mileage to save money but enough power for passing on the highway, and above all, reliability.  So far, it's done exactly what it was supposed to do.  
  The V6 has a bit more power than I expected, but it's not going to win any races.  The ride is a bit rougher than expected, but there's a trade-off because the handling and road-feel are better than I thought they would be.  Overall the car is pretty easy to drive and reasonably comfortable, but it doesn't really stand out or fall short in any category.  The only thing I hate about it is that it has an airbag, and since that's mandatory, I can't blame anyone but the government for that intrusion upon my safety.  Will it kill me or save my life if it ever deploys?  Who knows?  One other dislike is that it came with a radio but no tape deck or CD player; again, that's just a question of options, not the car model itself.  The speakers are OK for a factory-stock set-up, I just need to install a player of some sort.  
  Overall, I'll just be honest and say this car bores me.  The most exciting thing about it is the little Dodge Ram emblem on the hood.  It's good transportation and would do just fine for the majority of drivers out there.  If you buy a car to get from point A to point B and back again, this is a pretty good choice.  But if you want more in the way of style, or performance, or luxury, this car is just too middle-of-the-road.<br><br>
