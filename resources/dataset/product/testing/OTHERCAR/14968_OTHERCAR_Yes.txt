            I recently purchased a Sony Mavica F73 digital camera.  For the most part I am very happy with this purchase.  One of the pros that led me to purchase this camera was the fact that it held a 3 1/2&quot; floppy disk and it was very easy to transfer photos from the camera to the computer.  This is very convenient when you are at a function such as a wedding.  All you have to do is pop the disk out of the camera and hand it to the bride and groom allowing them to go home and view their photos immediately.  The other cameras that I considered did not have this option.  The camera would have to be connected to the computer and the photos downloaded to the computer or disk. 

 For the $498 I paid for this camera, I feel it has some very nice features.  The 10x zoom lens is a great option.  I did find, however, that it works best in brightly lit settings.  If the camera is zoomed on a subject indoors, I have found the photo to come out grainy, blurry, and dark.  It does work great outdoors using the zoom though.  I have zoomed in on snowmobiles racing and the pictures were unbelievably crisp and clear for the speed of the subject.  

This is the most economical priced Mavica camera offering the lowest resolution of their cameras.  I have found that for the purpose I use it for, it works just fine.  If you would like higher resolution or maybe to be able to make mini movies, you may want to move up to one of their other Mavica cameras.  Of course, the price goes up with each additional feature.  
I recommend looking into this camera when shopping for a digital camera!<br><br>
