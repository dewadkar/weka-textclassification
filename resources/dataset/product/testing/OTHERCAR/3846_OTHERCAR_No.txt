            I bought my 1993 Achieva through a private sale in 1997.  I liked the way the car looked and it handled really well.  What I found out [to late] was that the Quad engine is one of the toughest and most expensive engines to work on.  To further explain myself - I am now in a serious dilemma:

The head gasket is leaking and it is going to cost me a little over a grand to fix it.  Mind you that is only if the Head is still in tact.  If the Head is not, I can add another couple hundred to the bill.  Now, I ask myself; &quot;Do I want to put that kind of money into my car or should I start looking for a new one (not that I can afford one)?&quot;

My car has just about 88,000 miles on it and I know that if I put this ridiculous amount of money into the car, something else will go wrong with it.  Not to mention the fact that I already changed my breaks three times, I had to put new shocks and struts on the car, the alternator seized about 2 months before the head gasket problem, there is a short in the wires somewhere which makes my &quot;check oil&quot; light flicker on and off, and my automatic door locks do not work properly either.

Well, enough about the con's of this vehicle and let me tell you about the pro's:  Oh, sorry, there aren't any.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  I know that older cars have problems, but this car is not that old and I take really good care of it.<br><br>
