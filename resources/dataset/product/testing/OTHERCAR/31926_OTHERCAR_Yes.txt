            I recently purchased a 2001 Subaru Forester S Premium. My wife and I are very satisfied with the size, handling and features of this, our first SUV. We shopped for numerous &quot;types&quot; of vehicles as we are DINKS, but our hobbies and animals should find it comfortable in the cargo area of the Forester.
Firstly, I cannot say enough about the styling, features, handling and HUGE sunroof, but in order to receive 24-27 mpg, one must not be in heavy, stop-and-go traffic. This is where it suffers (even though we're still in the break-in period). Also, we just sold our Mustang GT, so the acceleration is taking some getting used to.
It has been very rainy the past two weeks and the AWD performs very admirably, as well as, providing a lot of confidence in wet weather. This occurred on a 1.5 hour trip which gave me a chance to test the seats. I will say they are comfortable, especially when making lumbar adjustments in the driver's seat.  
The room is cozy in front. I'm 6'1&quot;, 270 lbs and don't feel at all cramped, but adjustments have to be made for the rear passenger if I'm driving.
I highly recommend the Forester S Premium, especially if you need the room, handling and like the good looks, however I would wait until they introduce the Boxer 4 Turbo (which is rumored). (Darned English get all the fun stuff!!!)
On a personal note, I buy cars approximately every ten years, so the base or L models were not even considerations when purchasing the S.
Five stars *****
