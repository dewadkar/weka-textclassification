            The only Voyage that my minivan constantly went on was to the service department. I purchased my 1997 Grand Voyager new in August 1996. It was a great running vehicle until about 15,000 miles except for the mystery wiper that would come on(bad fuse). Then cam the power dor locks motors failing in the dual sliding door. Both sliding doors locking mechanisms were repaired four times. Then came the steering column thumbing.(Turned out to be a bad CV joint which if it had failed while driving would cause the driver to lose control of steering wheel). After CV joint was replaced, the minivan shook after another 500 miles. Back to the shop for stabilzer bar replacement. Battery dead at 1 year and brakes wore out at 22,000 miles. I started to wonder what was so great about Chrysler. At 36,000 after researching on Edmunds.com, that owners have had the transmission fail betweeen 35,000 and 45,000 miles, I had enough and traded  the beast in for another minivan.

I originally bought this vehicle for the amount of room it has for kids and their stuff. This is one of the best features of this van is the amount of space. It drives very poorly in bad weather( rain and snow). It tends to slide out of control due to the loose steering.

The only person who should buy this vehicle is one that needs space and buys the extended warranty. If you don't mind going to the friendly service department, then this is your minivan. Most people don't have this kind of time. I would turn your attention towards a Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. <br><br>
