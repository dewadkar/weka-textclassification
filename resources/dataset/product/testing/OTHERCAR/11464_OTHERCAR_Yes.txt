            * the basics
I purchased my 1995 Saturn SL-2 when I was working my way through college, so it was important to find an economical car--one that didn't cost too much to buy, and wouldn't cost too much to own (originally, I wanted a used one, but I found out that they held their value so well, it was foolish, at the time, not to buy new!).  I also wanted good handling and power, in a &quot;presentable&quot; car.  I was not disappointed.

The car exceeded my expectations.  It was a great sporty/affordable/reliable/presentable/safe car.  My wife and I put about 65k miles on it, until it was totalled by an (aftermarket) tire blow-out, which I would not attribute in any way to the car.

The dealer (Saturn of West Covina, CA--now defunct, I think, but they're in Duarte as well) is really like the commercial.  They KNEW ME every time I came in for service, and seemed to care.  This surprised me.  They were also ZERO-pressure on the sale.  Saturn of Denver, however, has been disappointing, but probably only by comparison to the dealer I purchased mine at.  So, your mileage may vary.  Trip around the dealership a bit if you're buying new.  See if they're like the commercials.

* love and hate
I loved its safety, reliability, handling, sporty looks, and affordability, but hated its smelly air conditioning and rattling dash.  That said--I loved it about 100 times as much as anything I hated about it.

* safety
After about 18k miles, I plowed into a stopped car, doing about 45 mph, and was uninjured, though my left hand was sore for a week because the airbag slammed it into the left door.  The repairs (about $4000) were not noticeable.  Although I was paranoid about it, I could never tell the car had been damaged.  My wife ROLLED the car, and walked away with a single bruise on her arm--period.  The insurance company just declared it totalled--the &quot;space-frame&quot; construction and properly adjusted seat belts probably saved my wife's life.

* reliability
In the 65k miles and six years we drove it, we replaced the battery after three years, and replaced the ignition coil (~$200 part) after about three and a half.  There was a service bulletin on leaky weather-stripping, which, after we reported the problem, the dealer fixed free under warrantee.  That's it.  We serviced it regularly from original purchase all the way until totalling it (I get the feeling some of the reviewers don't service their cars, because some have total nightmares, and some never have a single problem--it doesn't seem to matter what make or model of car!).  The service was surprisingly inexpensive (compare Saturn to other brand dealers).

* shake, rattle, 
The dash is just plain noisy.  I think they sold that dash only on the '95 model.  The air-conditioning is stinky.  Road noise is a little higher than similar cars.

* and roll 
It's the best-handling Sedan I've ever driven--really stiff, but I haven't driven a German road car.  I can really say it seemed to drive like new up until the very end.  It never got &quot;loose.&quot;  It's powerful enough, but only with the 5-speed.  I thought the automatic was too slow out of the gate and didn't buy it.

* wham, bam!
The plastic body panels and space-frame construction are awesome!  We never got a dent or ding.  Of course, we got scratches and chips--especially on the front-edge of the hood above the headlights.  Sometimes I got the feeling that people were &quot;testing&quot; the durability of the body panels by slamming shopping carts against our doors like in the commercial.  I occasionally found small scratches in the doors.  I could suspect that we avoided having dings removed at the body shop because they just did not happen--instead we got occasional scratches, most of which rub out with polishing compound.

* summary
I strongly recommend the 1995 Saturn SL-2, if you are satisfied with the interior and exterior appearance.  If the interior is comfortable to you, you'll probably love this car.  See if the road noise is too much for you or if the dash is too noisy.  See if the air conditioning stinks (literally).  Check the SERVICE RECORD at the Saturn dealer, to see what's been done to the car (has it been properly maintained?)  Saturn advertises this as a selling feature--pointing to its high resale value (I paid 15.5k, and we'll probably get 8k after 6 years and 65k miles).<br><br>
