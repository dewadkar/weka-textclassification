            One of my close friends from Boston just purchased her first car.  Looking at a range in the low $40s, she decided to go with the 2000 Lexus GS400.  Needless to say she is a spoiled little girl, but then again what International Student isnt?  I have actually had the opportunity to drive her car around Boston, and it is one of the most amazing cars I have ever driven.  Boston does not have the worst or most treacherous roads in the United States, but it does have its fair share of bumps and potholes.  Running the GS400 through Downtown Boston, it had no problems what so ever.  Where as my other friends BMW 328i with sport package had an extremely rough ride on the bumps, the GS400 had the most bumpfree ride ever.  This is not to say that the GS400 has an extremely soft and numb ride.  Its handling and cornering capabilities are so good that the driver of a GS400 feels empowered enough to take highway offramps at 60 mph.  The steering is precise and very accurate.  There is minimal rolling of the chassis and body of the car.  The power in this car is amazing, and thus was quoted to be the fastest automatic sports sedan out.  The ride is not only luxuriously comfortable, but the noise level is extremely low.  Only under full throttle is the engine noise a bit loud, but it is the good kind of loud.  The seats are so comfortable with the hand crafted leather seats and back support.  The performance of this car is unmatched in its class, and the design of the GS400 is far superior to much of the other dated styles.  The GS400 has xenon lights that add a finishing touch to a perfect design.  The dual exhaust system gives the sporty touch, while the lines suggest lavish luxury.  The front head lights are extremely well blended into the lines of the car and the rear tail lights have a futuristic setup, unlike any other car yet.  The BMW 540i has an extremely dated style that needs some updating.  Even the New 3 series by BMW is just a little modification of an old style that BMW is afraid to let go of.  However, Lexus has thrown away all its norms to create this New GS400 and is a complete success.  If you are looking for a luxury sports sedan around 40k, please check out the GS400.    <br><br>
