            You've probably heard or read hundreds of reviews of the Saturn SL, and it all just seems so hokey to you.  Well, that's why you joined Epinions.com, to put the hype behind you and get some real answers from real people.
I have owned a 1994 SL for three years, and let me personally assure you:  It is all true!
At the same time, take it for what it is worth.  No one would be foolish enough to say that a Saturn SL never breaks down.  It is, after all, still a car.  But the fact is that compared to other cars, they are much more dependable and really do cost much less to maintain.  Yes, you still have to change the oil (it's a cinch) and do all the normal maintenance...  Bottom line is that this car was obviously designed by mechanics with the goal of making shorter stays in the shop.  That should tell you a lot.
If that isn't good enough for you, try this:  My SL recently turned 100,000 miles, and all that had gone bad was the alternator, which I replaced myself for $85.
The only flaws with this car are creature comforts:  my model year was a noisy one, a problem that Saturn listened to and solved last year.
Also kind of disappointing in most models is the relatively flimsy nature of certain plastic interior parts, but this is not nearly as bad as certain Toyotas or Hondas I've seen of the same age.
I'm confident that Saturn will continue to listen to its customers to make little improvements along the way.
So how about the service?  Well, I took my SL into the shop for the first time to do the standard 100K tune-up.  The service was fantastic, affordable and quick.  Saturn is legendary for their dealer-side service before the sale, and I can assure you it goes way beyond the showroom floor.
