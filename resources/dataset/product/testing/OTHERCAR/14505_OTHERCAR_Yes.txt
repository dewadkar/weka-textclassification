            I own a 2001 Frontier Crew Cab 4X4 with the super charger.   The new 210 Hp engine has the power and quickness when you need it, but don't expect to beat everything on the road, the truck is still 4000 pounds and Car and Driver says it does 0-60 in 11 seconds, as opposed to 12 seconds in the non-SC model. Despite the numbers, the super charger makes a dramatic edge in performance. Obviously, gas mileage can suffer if you are pushing it especially hard. Living in PA, I still have to see how the truck handles in the snow with the -performace- "all season radial" tires it came with.  In general, the car is very tight, quiet, and handles quite well, go for a test drive and see for yourself. I am very happy with the purchase, and considering I drove my Pathfinder to 170,000 miles, I should have this truck for quite a long time.  PS-For all of you car audio geeks, the doors are well equiped to hold component speakers and coaxial's. For those who want to replace the factory amp (on the 100w system), there is space against the back wall, and certain amps will fit, (ex.2001 RockFord Fosgate 600.5 14"X9"X2").  However, when it comes to finding space for a subwoofer, good luck.  No major enclosure company's make anything for these trucks, I have yet to see if a 6" bazooka will fit, but I doubt it. (bazooka, yea I'm desperate for bass). A lot of people have told me it can't be done, others have said "no problem", for a pricey custom job. So thats just a little to keep in mind.
