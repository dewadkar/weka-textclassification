            With this camera, you can forget about your old point-and-shoot!  This is a great camera.  It's small size allow it to be carried everywhere.  It's sturdy construction makes sure it'll get back in one piece.  The picture quality is superb.  If you are not planning on printing out pictures larger than 8 x 11, the resolution is more than ample.  I just got some 4 x 6s back from Shutterfly and they look like any prints from my old film cameras.  

The camera comes with alot of manual options and presets.  There should be enough to give the avid photographer his/her options while keeping it simple for the rest of us.  I like the black and white photo setting.  It does look a bit purpleish.  Other than that, the pictures look very nice.  The flash on the camera is a bit small and some indoor pics are not too flattering.  Luckily it's a digital camera and all that can be fixed with the use of any photo editing software.

I have found the 8mb CompactFlash card that came with the camera to be too small (only take 4-5 pics at the highest resolution).  Luckily, you can upgrade that with either CompactFlash or CF2 or the IBM MicroDrive.  The USB connection is very fast and efficient.

Overall, this is a good, solid digital camera.  It's easy to use and it can be used anywhere.  I wish the camera came with a rechargible battery and AC adaptor.  I had to purchase them seperatedly.  Still, it's a great camera for everyday use.<br><br>
