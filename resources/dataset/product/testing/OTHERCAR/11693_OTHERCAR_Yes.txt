            First of all, This car rides smoothly and is very nice to handle.  Sounds nice huh.... yea right.  This car always has a problem.  It seems like mine is in the shop every other week.  These are about 40,000 to start with so i do not think that you should think about getting one.  The cost to maintain one of these is much more than some cars cost in the first place, and I don't think anyone goes into buying a car wanting something like problems.  I mean do you say, &quot;Alright, I am going to buy a car.  I want an SUV that is never in my two door garage, but in the shop garage, yea that is what i want.  I want to pay tons of money to maintain my vehicle.  Nobody should buy this car for a couple of years until they get all their glitches out of it.  Once they do that The Land Rover Discovery will be the best out, but until then, it is Problem Child 4.<br><br>
