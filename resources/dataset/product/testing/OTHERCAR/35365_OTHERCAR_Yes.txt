            We bought this car in late January in the middle of a cold, but mild winter.  I wanted to kill the dealer, but finally bought the car.  And, I love the car.  It is a four-door, with full-power, moon-roof, CD player, heated seats, etc.  

The car drives great.  We got the 3800 6 cylinder engine.  It accelerates great.  We took it on a road trip to Dallas almost right away.  It was super smooth and super quiet.  

We had bucket seats in the front that are very comfortable.  It has enough adjustments, that you could move the seat around if your legs started getting stiff.

I had not had a car with a CD player before.  A CD player is a great way to kill time while driving.  The Buick sound system was most satisfactory.

The feature I liked the most was the heated bucket seats.  On a sub-zero day, the seats were warm within three city blocks.  It made the car seem comfortable immediately.  Every passenger I had in the car this winter was excited by this feature.  

I had sticker shock.  I hadn't shopped for a car since 1992 and knew it was going to be a shock, but still didn't really get it.  The GM rebate was very helpful as was a cash payment from a GM credit card I had been using for years.  Without the rebate and the credit card additional payment, I don't think I would have bought.  (My wife might have bought it anyway.)

The car has been very reliable, although it has only been three months.  Buick includes a CD about the car that tells you how to program numerous options.  For example, you have a choice of unlocking the doors, the drivers door only, or no doors when you move the transmission into park.  You have choices about whether the lights turn on automatically or manually.  Overall, the choices were nice, but programming the choices was pretty annoying.  For some of the choices, you held down the power lock, honked the horn, and pressed down on the accelerator at the same time to initiate a certain sequence.  (I've exaggerated a bit, but you get the general idea.)

I hate people who get goofy about their cars, but I like this Buick.  This is the fourth Buick I have had and I have really enjoyed them all.
