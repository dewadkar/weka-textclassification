            Word on the street is that Pontiac is trying to run with BMW and Infiniti.  I didn't believe it, went into a local Pontiac dealer not believing it, drove a loaded 2004 Grand Prix GTP with the Comp G package, and after driving it I still don't believe it.  However, comparos to the big boys aside, it's a reasonably good, reasonably quick sedan with a couple minor flaws and one big one.

The '04 Grand Prix is mostly new for this model year, and was an early release for the season.  Apparently Pontiac couldn't wait to unleash this thing on the public.  Styling is the first thing you notice about the car, and the styling is going in a somewhat different direction than other Pontiacs.  A near total absence of the ugly plastic garbage that festoons nearly every other Poncho is the first thing that strikes you.  The car has very clean, somewhat understated looks and is actually a little slab-sided.  The car looks good from the front, though the grille is a bit small.  The headlights and front fenders give the car an aggressive look.  Moving rearward, a well-raked windshield flows into a lightly rounded roofline and a rather quick drop in the C-pillar to a rounded-off trunk and a conservative spoiler.  Remember that low C-pillar, I'll talk about it more later.

Inside the car is a smartly-designed but poorly-implemented interior.  It'd be a great design if they'd used better materials.  The same cheap plastic that's been in every GM product for the last 20 years is in here too, evidence that General Motors is still being run by the wrong people--the accountants.  Sparing use of brushed-metal trim gives a bit of class to the interior.  My car had every option in the book, including a sunroof, leather seats and a head-up display.  The instruments are a much-improved item in this interior, and are easy to read under all light.  The HUD is another little gimmick I thought was worthless, but actually turned out to be a very handy and useful little gadget.  The head-up display appears to be floating in front of the car, and is very easy to read.  You don't even have to change your focus to read the display, which only shows the most vital information (usually just speed).  It's something I've never seen before, but it's definitely something I could get used to.  Heck, Pontiac's had this HUD for quite some time now, I'm surprised it hasn't filtered to lower-scale cars.

The seats are comfortable and supportive up front, and the front passenger seat folds flat to hold either some drinks or a laptop (Please dear GOD don't use the computer while you're driving!)  Rear seats are....crap.  The cushions are too low and too hard.  Getting in there isn't much better.  The doors open nearly 90 degrees to allow ease of entry, but that low C-pillar becomes a considerable obstacle to taller passengers.  I got in and out of the backseat 4 times, and each time I whacked my head on that stupid C-pillar.  By the end of the test drive I'm sure I nearly gave myself a concussion.  Make sure rear seat passengers are very short.  When not carrying passengers, the rear seat folds flat along with the front passenger seat, and in a nod to the PT Cruiser, you can stow long thin objects, up to 9 feet long, with the trunk lid closed.  Very handy for quick runs to Home Depot for some 2x4s.

On to the most important part of any car, the engine.  Motivating the top-line GTP Comp G is a supercharged version of GM's venerable, time-tested 3800 3.8L OHV V6, huffed on by an Eaton blower pushing 9 1/2 pounds of boost into the cast-iron 3800.  The result is 260 horsepower (up by 20 from last year) and a nice healthy 280 pound-feet of torque.  Power delivery is right where I like it--down low in the rev range.  Any more than about 1/4 of the drive-by-wire throttle and you'll lay a little patch of rubber.  Turn off the traction control and mash the gas and you'll put down a good 20 feet of rubber to the ground as the car sprints away.  Ordinarily, powerful front-drivers are victim to a demon called torque steer, a phenomenon wherein the car wants to pull to one direction under hard acceleration.  In this car, it's nonexistant.  The car pulls straight and true every time, and I have to hand it to the boys at GM for squashing that particular bug.  Power is routed to the front wheels via another tried and true bit from the GM parts bin; the 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission.  However here it gets a new toy as well, a manumatic feature GM is calling TAPshift.  Two little paddles on the wheel control the 4 cogs once the shifter is shoved all the way back to M.  The tranny responds well to your commands, and unlike other systems of this ilk, it will not change the gears for you.  The only time it shifts for you is back to first when you come to a stop.  Granted with only 4 gears the system is a bit constrained, but until GM develops an autobox with more gears we're stuck with it.

The one major quibble I have with the powertrain is a simple one.  It's powering the wrong half of the car.  If the Grand Prix were driving the back tires, the dynamics of this car would be much different (and in my opinion vastly improved), but for that we'll have to wait for the W platform to die, which may not be for a couple more years.

Once you're through burning up the BF Goodrich tires, you'll discover that this family sedan is actually a competent handler.  While it's not a BMW by any stretch of the imagination, it's not bad for what it is.  The W platform on which this car is based has its limits, and this car is admirably pushing them.  The car's StabiliTrak control system is seamless, using light brake control to keep the car in line, rather than by killing the throttle like so many other systems of this kind do.  In this way it works much better than those other systems because you don't even know it's working.  It's not particularly intrusive, and instills confidence.  The power steering on the car, however, needs work.  It's somewhat numb, and doesn't give adequate road feel.  The Magnasteer variable assist system varies boost based on both speed and lateral acceleration, feeding less and less boost as these factors increase.  It never seems quite right, never providing the right amount of boost.  It's far too light under highway cruising, and far too heavy in hard cornering.  It needs some adjustments, but it could work much better.

As for the ride, it's acceptable.  On New Mexico roads the ride was compliant enough, a bit choppy but livable.  On worse roadways it could get a bit ugly.  I'm told the regular GTP, with its less aggressive suspension, has a more compliant and comfortable ride, but one of those wasn't available.

Reliability could be a toss-up.  While the 3800 has been a powerplant in GM cars for ages, and has proven itself as basic but durable, the Eaton supercharger adds complexity.  Expect service costs to be somewhat higher, and with more parts there's a greater chance something's going to break.  The transmission however is a good one, and it's bulletproof.  I see no reason to doubt its reliability.


The last thing I want to talk about with this car is the price tag, which certainly wasn't cheap.  While the base GT bases around 22 thousand dollars, my test car stickered at nearly 31,000 bucks.  I have a hard time swallowing that for just a Grand Prix, but you do get a good car for the money.

If the Grand Prix doesn't suit you, there are of course other vehicles to pick from.  There's the other W cars, the Buick Regal and Chevy Impala, the Nissan Altima and Maxima, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus and VW Passat.  There's probably more but I can't think of them right now.
