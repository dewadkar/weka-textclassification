            The Pentax Optio S is probably one of the smallest and lightest cameras out on the market, but it's not short of features. I wont list them all here but in short it's got 3.2 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, 1.6inch LCD screen, voice recorder and a movie mode. 

The camera size is it's biggest feature, you wont know how small and light this camera is, till you put it in your hands, pictures don't do it justice. This camera is so small and stylishly built that you'll actually not start taking your camera everywhere you go and won't miss that perfect photo opportunity. 

As for picture quality, it's more than adequate for amateur users, but could be better, Canon's powershot range has slightly better quality images which seem more vivid than the Optio S's. But unless your planning to blow up or print large photographs the picture quality of the Optio S should be more than adequate. 

The battery life of this camera while more than adequate, could always be better but still allows you to take roughly around 60-80 pictures with the LCD on, which is quite good for the size of the camera. 

All in all, this camera is higly recommended, and I guarantee when you buy it, you'll fall in love with it's size and feature set.
