            I brought a used Protege at 31,000 miles from a dealer.  I proceeded to total it in an accident five months later.  In the process I put almost 5,000 miles on it.  

Pros:  This is a car that I throughly enjoyed having.  The styling was great, color was beautiful, and I could get three friends in with no problem.  The cruise control was great which is especially important to me because I have a four and a half hour commute from home to school.  I thought that it drove almost like a sports car.  It took tight turns easily and smoothly.  I also liked the fact that the back seats came down to allow me extend my trunk.  I never really had a chance to use it though.  The seats were comfortable for me for short drives.  I could easily drive up to 75 mph without feeling like I was getting a massage.  It handles high speeds nicely and has great gas mileage.  I averaged about 31-32 mpg on the highway and about 30 mpg in city traffic.  

Cons:  My major beef with this car was that I had driven a V-6 before getting this car which was a V-4.  As a result, I had to exercise patitence with the acceleration.  You have to gradually increase your speed.  You cannot just hit the pedal and expect to zoom off.  Also, I felt that the car had high wind noise especially when traveling at high speeds on the highway (legally of course).  I could not listen to music while driving on the interstate because of this noise.  There is also practically no center armrest to rest your arm on.  

The biggest thing I have to say about this car is that it has excellent safety systems.  In my wreck, I slammed into guardrail at about 45-55 mph.  I came away with only a burn on my chin from the airbag, a broken little toe (weird, I know), and bruises from the seatbelt.  I owe my life to that car.

In summary, this is a car that I would recommend without hestiation to any high school student, college student, a single person, or a small family.  The only people I would not recommend it for are people who live in the mountains or very hilly areas.
