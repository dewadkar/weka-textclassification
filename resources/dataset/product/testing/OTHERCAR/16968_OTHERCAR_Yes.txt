            I have owned a Toyota RAV4 for two and a half years, and it is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned!  It handles well in all types of weather. I have over 50,000 miles on it now and the original tires. I considered buying new tires for this winter, the third winter with it, but was &quot;caught&quot; in snow and ice last week, and it went through like a trooper!
I was reading at the dealer's, while waiting for an oil change, a brochure about SUV's being &quot;top heavy&quot; and not putting things on the roof, which would make this imbalance worse.  I have a roof rack on my RAV4 and have carried several things, from Christmas trees to Sunfish sails. I have never experienced this sensation of top heaviness, or &quot;easy to tip over&quot; feeling. Granted, I do not drive fast or make sudden, sharp turns, but safe drivers know not to do that anyhow. Right? Anyway, I would say this is a great vehicle for someone who is needing to get there in all kinds of weather, is a safe driver, and likes the versatility that this little gem provides.  I plan to drive mine for the foreseeable future, having been told by the salesman (?!) that it will just be broken in at 100,000 miles!<br><br>
