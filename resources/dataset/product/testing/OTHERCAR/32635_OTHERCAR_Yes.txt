            I own a 97 Pontiac Sunfire. With my kids now grown I decided that I no longer needed to drive the monster van that I had and I just loved the looks of this car. It has been the most reliable auto that I've owned to date. I drive round trip 110 miles a day to school and back home and I've never had any problems with the Sunfire. My car now has 53,000 miles on it and it's still going strong. I get great mileage and a really nice ride to boot. I take it on 2 trips a year, each one 700 miles one way and have found it always a pleasure to drive. Mine is a 5 speed and I love the way it hugs a corner. I definitely will buy another in a few years.
