            I looked at them all. They all had good points but if you want all the best features in one van go with the 2004 Sienna.  230 horses are eager at any speed. The handling is superb,the transmission smooth and the ride is supple. The IIHS website ranks the 2003 and earlier Sienna number 1 in offset crash tests. I would expect the 2004 to be at least as good. To the other reviewer that was considering a Montana, take a look at the actual crash pictures between the Sienna and Montana(ranked last). You would sustain certain serious injury in the Montana and none in the Sienna.
 Now because I only have enough money to feed the kids macaroni on payday I went with the base model CE which comes well equipped at a good price with a lot of standard features that are optional in the competition. Up here in Canada a couple of things are standard on the base model that are not included in the U.S.,ie power remote heated mirrors and cruise control. Other unusual standard features are ABS with electronic brake force distribution,rear air and heat,and second row power windows. The selling feature is the 60/40 split rear seat that allows either side or both to fold flat. Because of the seat well the towing hitch is low to the ground so be aware of abrupt changes in road angle or you'll grind the drawbar to the skinny. The van is big and wide which gives it good stability and allows it to take a 4x8 sheet. A spy mirror for the rear seat isn't too helpful since the optics aren't great and you have to lean over to view it. By that time the kids have stopped whatever it was that made you look in the first place.
 I have but one beef to give. Toyota has introduced a fly by wire system rather than a throttle cable which has an annoying half second acceleration delay when you punch the pedal. The dealers advice is to get used to it. Well, my advice to Toyota is to fix this problem and you would have the perfect van
