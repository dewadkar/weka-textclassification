            I have used 35mm cameras for years and bought this camera after researching for the features I had to have after owning a JamCam 3.0, possibly the worst digital camera ever made. I used the JamCam mostly for eBay pictures and it was just barely adequate and drove me crazy with sporadic unexplained problems.  I used other people's digitals as tests and took a lot of advice.

This camera has exceeded my best expectations.  It was very easy to learn and I don't understand the folks that say  the internal (rather than exterior buttons) are hard to learn, that the flash is inadequate, and the screen hard to see.  None of these things is true.  The screen in very bright sunlight IS hard to see........ this is just physics... gads, find some shade !

My results with the Macro setting have been phenomenal and I have to say some of my best shots are under 14 inches, both on regular and macro settings. I have just recieved prints from a photosite called www.shutterfly.com which allows you to upload your prints from the camera or a stored album on your computer, and these pictures are the sharpest and most colorful I have ever taken.  Even ones taken at the lower resolutions are excellent.  The two lowest resolutions (of the 4 available) are recommended for internet and email use, and I have found this to be true, as it is with any digital camera.

The manual is clear and complete, a rarity for any manual.

There is no softwear included for detailed editing (like Adobe PhotoDeluxe,which I already have), but the album page which appears as you download the camera does have capability for rotating, cropping, and enlarging.  Most of the time, this is all you need.

I bought a 4-battery pack of NiMh batteries with charger for $20 at Sam's and this has been GREAT.  Camera only requires 2 AA batteries (another great plus), so I always have 2 batteries charging. I do not consider that this camera "eats" these batteries, and have been pleasantly surprised by the dozens of shots I've gotten from each recharge.  As with any digital camera, be smart, invest in rechargables.

I do plan to get another card, probably a 64 MB (saw one the other day for $35) to take on vacations, but you will be surprised how many pictures you can get on a 16 MB card, especially at the medium or lower resolutions.

I love this camera and think it is a great buy for the features!
