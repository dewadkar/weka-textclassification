            I like the size and ride, but in my opinion there are flaws that GM should correct.  The air conditioning is inadequate in hot weather even with a rear AC installed.  For some reason when you turn the AC off, it blows cold air on your feet.  
The paint came off the differential within about six months and the chassis somewhat later (there is no excuse for that).  The interior upholstery is poor and the reinforcement in the drivers armrest failed immediately and again when replaced.  The leather on the steering wheel gets scuffed, and I think the wheel was replaced about four times before the warranty ran out.  
There is a strange and persistent squeak from the rear suspension that the dealer cannot fix. On the positive side, I really like having all the space to fit the family in and have all kinds of stuff in the back at the same time.  I like the appearance and it's a car I like being seen in.
I've had the Yukon for about 2 years now, and the bottom line is that I'm looking forward to trading it in for the Landcruiser that I really wanted all along.  
The opinions below about reliability, comfort, quality, roominess, and handling were selected from a list and therefore may not reflect the exact spin that I would have given them.<br><br>
