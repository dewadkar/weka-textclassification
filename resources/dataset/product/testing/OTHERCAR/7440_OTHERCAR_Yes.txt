            I was looking for a nice size family car at a good price. After looking at a lot of different brands and models I chose the Poniac Grand Am SE. It is a really nice car for the price. Well worth the money. 

It has a semi-sporty appearance, drives and rides really smooth, and is great on gas. From the outside it does not appear to be very big. However, I was really impressed with the amount of room inside the car-- definately deceiving! My husband is very tall and has no problem at all getting and in and has enough leg room to be comfortable.

One of the great features it is equipped with is a type of safely lock so that once you lock the doors to get out there is a 30 second delay before it locks incase you have accidently left your keys inside you still have time to get them out.

On the down side-- one feature that does not appeal to me is the passenger side seat (in the 2 door model) Once you slide the seat forward to let a passenger into the back the seat has to be slide completely back as far as it will go to a locking position and then repositioned where you want it. The seat does not slide bvack very easily to the locking position. I have found that it is very hard for someone small or elderly to do. If the seat is not properly locked into place, hen driving down the road to stop it slides forward with no warning.
