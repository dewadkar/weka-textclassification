            My husband and I bought this car because we have an hour and a half commute to and from work.  We wanted a car that was comfortable and fun to be in.  We got the FX package, so the car comes with a sunroof, CD and tape player, &quot;leather&quot; seats and some other details.  The only problem we have had with the car was the rims on the wheels.  They had not been fitted correctly.  Our dealership replaced them right away and everything else has been great.  DON'T buy this car if you are tall.  My brother-in-law has a hard time getting out of and into this car.  If you can't afford a typical sports car, this is a great alternative.  It really looks sharp too!
