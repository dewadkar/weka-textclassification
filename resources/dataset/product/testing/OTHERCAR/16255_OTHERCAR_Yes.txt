            When i wanted to buy a car for the first time after my graduation, i really was very confused. Given that there are 100's of choices for a single or just married person , compact sedans are the best choice.
Toyota corolla , Honda civic are the two good choices in that class.
But ,Toyota corolla is cheaper than Honda Civic!!
Toyota Corolla has three models VE / CE / LE.
All the models are very good.
The price and features grow from VE to CE and to LE.
There are sometimes value packages apart from the standard models.
These value packages vary from dealer to dealer...
The major points that one should note about corolla are :
1. RELIABILITY 
2. Most of the necessary Major Features for a comfort car are included
3. QUALITY  

I am currently a proud owner of 1999 corolla CE.
I also would suggest to buy the alarm system with keyless entry system.
It's very useful and adds to the security of your car.
It makes worth every penny you have paid for it...period.
