            This is my second purchase of a Mazda.  A second Protege.  Both cars have been remarkably dependable and loyal to me.  As far as compact cars go, this car compares well with the Escort and Cavaliar.
The car rides smooth for a compact.  I've been to 80,000 miles before any type of maintenance was needed.  And that was just the usual wear and tear of breaks, muffler, timing belt and battery.  The protege gets good gas mileage as it should.  I try to do my own maintenance (oil change, spark plugs, radiator flush) and all the parts are easy to get to.
My local dealership always has parts I need and are very friendly.  The only bad thing I could say about both cars were that a radio is not included in the base model, not even an AM radio.  But if you're looking for a new car, to avoid the possible hassles of a used car, this is a good car to own.  It's reliable, economical and looks sharp too.<br><br>
