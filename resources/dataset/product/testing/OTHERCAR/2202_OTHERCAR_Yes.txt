            I have been driving my 2000 Prelude ('98 - '02 are all virtually identical) for a year now, and what a year it has been! I still look forward to getting into it every day and enjoying it's dead accurate steering, the 'hold-you-tight' seats, the no nonsense does what you tell it responsiveness, the just-right feedback through the steering wheel and suspension.
** Who this car is for **
This is a drivers car. Honda engineers put a premium on performance with this car. You don't pay for - nor are they offered - things like heated memory mirrors & seats, wiper de-icers, trip computers, compass temperature displays, auto temp control, traction control, or On Star. Every penny goes to performance, though not to the extreme of the Integra Type R, which further strips A/C and sound deadening material among other things for the sake of performance. This car is for those who care about good, reliable, no nonsense performance but can't afford a BMW M3 and are willing to sacrifice some of the extras. Indeed, the M3 is probably the next car on the price ladder that performs as well as the Prelude. If you're considering the Prelude, you might also consider the Acura RSX. Judging by the numbers, it's a Prelude with a different skin and a sixth gear. I wish my Prelude had six speeds.
** Who this car is not for **
People over six feet may not be comfortable in the Prelude. People over five feet won't be comfortable in the back seat. If you're looking for a car with a lot of goodies like 4WD, traction control, navigation system, memory everything, heated seats etc. you'll have to look at something else. They are not offered on the Prelude.
If you're the practical type who wants nothing more from a car than to get from point A to point B, you could find something cheaper. This car is also not easy to get into and out of. It sits low to the ground and the seats are close to the floor.
**Other observations**
Even though it goes from 0 - 60 in seven seconds flat, it's kind of slow from a dead stop. At about 4500 RPMs the variable valve lift kicks in and you feel a rush of acceleration. I think this is Honda's way of giving us the choice of driving economically, that is with higher gas mileage, or, more spritely by keeping the revs high. You can keep the revs in the 'VTEC' zone by shifting at the redline.
The dealer sent my Prelude out to have leather installed and it's already starting to wear.
I did (gasp!) have a problem with my car. I had some noise from the rear strut damper in cold weather. It was fixed after a few trips to the dealer.
I didn't get the Active Torque Transfer option, this car drives fine without it.
