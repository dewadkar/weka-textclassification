            The 1997 VW Golf has proved to be a excellent vehicle of choice for people looking for a car not only to get them from point a to point b, but a car that does it with personality. The Golf was available with some added options that year, such as the K2 or Trek option that allows its owners to aquire bikes or snow boards and such to use their VW to its extent- having fun. The car has a real classic design. It doesn't seem to ever get old. It is fresh and updated. Along with the 100,000 mile drivetrain and engine warranty, the other mechanical operations on the car have proved very reliable and top engineered. I have yet to have a problem with this car, and maintenance is cheap to perform on it. This car likes to drive! Its fun to do so, and is great for long treks across the country. I recommend this car to anyone who likes VW's. This car attracts mainly young buyers, because of its cheap insurance rates, low maintenance cost, great gas mileage, and great design. The car handles superb, not like a sports car, but like a regular hatchback would. Equipped with a manual transmission, the car is easy and troublefree to drive. If you want a car to get you from point a to point b real fast, don't buy it. If you want a car to get you from point a to point b reliably, with great gas mileage, and with a sense of superb German engineering, buy the Volkswagen Golf. You can't go wrong.<br><br>
