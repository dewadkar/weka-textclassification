            I purchased my Navajo in 2000.  I bought it quickly and did not put any research into my choice.  Luckily, my hasty purchase was not a problem.  Over the 3 years I have owned this car it has had only 1 engine related problem that was a sensor that was easily fixed.

The ABS light has been on constantly since I purchased it, I have not noticed any problems with the brakes, and a mechanic checked them, and said not to worry about the light.

Now that the car is turning 10,it has begun to feel its age.
The drivers side door hinge is hanging to low, so shutting the door is a problem.  The interior is starting to show its age with some cracks etc.

The 4WD has never been great, sometimes it will engage and sometimes not.  Often the car will not come out of 4WD on the first try.

Since the Navajo is 2 door, getting in and out of the back seat can be hard on older people, and if you need to use a car seat in the back it is difficult to reach.  It is a high step up to the car to pull yourself into the back seat.

The A/C is exceptional.  I love the power drivers seat.  It has plenty of cargo room, with the back seats up or down.
