            Same equipped van is 3k more when it comes to its competitors!  My van was new May 99.  Its an SE 4dr, loaded. I paid new 19960.00, sticker was 27500.00-- Thats a deal!! My van has 21k miles on its 3.3 L. I have had no real problems with the van.  The van handles well and rides very smoothly.  I found that the engines shift quite well and the pick up is excellent.  My van at 85 ( I know thats too fast!) is at 2500 rpms and is as smooth as ice.  The braking could be better, mine has abs, but has a slight shimmy that is just normal. (told by experts).  I wish I had 16&quot; rims instead of 15&quot; for better response but I have no real complaints.  My vans only real grip, which most van owners will say, the rear doors raddle. Drives me crazy and is going in to be fixed.  I knew it would happen before I bought it!  I bought the quad seat, which i would recommend highly-- mine has the intergrated child seat which has been awesome.  The space in this van is incredible. Lots of room to grow! I only have 1 Kid but he comes with lots of stuff-- and stuff this van can handle.  Im looking at the 2001 but with the limited model range, I think Ill keep this van.  I wish they would make the 3rd row seat disappear like the odyssey! But oh well! Maybe in 2005! Happy Car shopping!<br><br>
