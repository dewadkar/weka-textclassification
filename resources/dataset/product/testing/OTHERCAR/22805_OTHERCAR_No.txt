            Cadillac jumps on the SUV bandwagon, Bravo Cadillac, you gave my grandparents something to buy. Immediately upon hearing of this monster truck, they had to go buy one. They had to be the first with one in their condo complex in Florida. THANKS CADILLAC, you are helping them spend my inheritence. I won't get anything at this rate.
The picture epinions has up makes this truck look like any other silly suv. The front if what distinguishes this Monstrosity. 
The ride is nice, it is all one should expect from Cadillac, roomy, and for the one who wants to be spoiled. A luxury off road vehicle, like that makes any sense at all. I thought Land Rovers were stupid, people who buy these things never drive them off road. That is their intended purpose this is just silly for use around town. It is ineffecient and causes more pollution than a car. 
Getting around 12mpg is not good for the environment, or the savings my grandparents are supposed to leave to me when they die. 
The engine- a big caddy v8. Powerful, Yes, it feels like it accelerates quickly, but it is deceiving in that this is a truck weighing in at an obese almost 3 and a half tons. Try pushing that fast! Just getting anything that heavy moving requires serious horsepower, which this truck has a good amount of, 250 I think it was. Less than a corvette, but more than my z34, but it couldn't out run me. It's just to heavy.
This is a great truck don't get me wrong, IF you want to bounce along off road and use it the way it is supposed to be used. But we all know who buys these trucks. People who want to show off that they own the Caddy Truck. Be the first to have something and feel you are suddenly so important. 
In a day and age where pollution is finally adding up and new cancers are being found all the time, and the US is so dependent on foreign oils, these SUVs are some of the most unfriendly vehicles on the market today. 
I am glad the loophole on their emissions is about to be closed. Hopefully the trend towards these ridiculous things is almost over.
I won't even begin to get into what they do to a car on impact, but if you know your physics, just think about 3.5 tons travelling 40mph impacting something smaller and under one ton.<br><br>
