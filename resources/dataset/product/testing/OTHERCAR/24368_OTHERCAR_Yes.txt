            I use the Sony DSC-F55 for several uses from work based functions for publications and web pages to personal use.  Overall I would give Sony an A-.  The quality of the pictures is excellent.  I can't wait to see what 3.3 mega-pixels will look like.  The MemoryStick media is great and looks like sony is supporting with a variety of products however you will definitly need more that the standard 4Mb stick.  The size is just right and easy to carry. The serial cable that comes standard is quite slow on high resolution picture transfers to the PC. I would much rather have a USB connection. It could use some form of Red-eye reduction but thats the beauty of digital pictures, it is so easy to remove using a graphics editor.

Put a 5X optical zoom and some way to light up low light settings so they are visible in the LCD viewfinder and you have a great camera.
