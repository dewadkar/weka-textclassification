            My dad bought a Dodge Dakota SLT Club Cab V6 new in February of 1997 and the truck has been plagued with problems ever since he bought it.
First off, the paint quality is terrible (he has emerald green) and the bedliner that the dealer installed chipped the paint off the bed rails within a few days. It was repainted but the rest of the truck is prone to scratches in the paint as well.  The fuel economy of this 3.9L V6 is terrible rivaling that of a V8, especially considering that it's not very powerful either.  The problems started when the truck simply started to die at stoplights, or would have trouble getting started and the idle would be very low on the verge of stalling and it would make the entire vehicle shake violently.  Then the truck started to stall when put into reverse, either that or when it was put into reverse it would rattle like a diesel and the revs would bounce all over the place, the brake pedal would rise even if you had full pressure on it and the truck would peel out in reverse.  The truck was in the shop numerous times for days on end when this was happening but it was never corrected.  As well, the brakes are absolutely terrible, the pads wear out and front rotors need to be replaced every 25000 Kms.  The interior trim is of very poor quality and breaks easily (replaced glove box and centre console as well as numerous trim pieces).  As of three years of owning this truck it has been in the shop for over 130 days for these problems and still has problems: it clunks in and out of gear (especially reverse), the idle just seems like it is barely keeping itself where it should be - very high strung.  

So far this is what has been done:
(Currently with 110,000 Kms)
- Front brakes/rotors replaced 4 times
- Rear Drums turned once
- Transmission replaced 2 times
- Torque converter replaced
- Rear-End rebuilt
- O2 sensors replaced 5-6 times
- Catalytic converter replaced 5 times
- Map sensor / assd. sensors in motor replaced
- Fuel pump wiring replaced
- Fan assembly replaced
- Glovebox &amp; Centre Console replaced
- All 4 Factory tires bald @ 45,000 Kms
- Bed repainted
- 2 front speakers blown
- Electrical problems caused HVAC/lighting/keyless to malfunction

Needless to say NO ONE in my family or anyone else that knows about this truck is ever buying a Chrysler vehicle again.  They are garbage.  

BTW: This truck was supposed to go to the Chrysler Tech Center for the engineers to look at it and diagnose the problems but they were so backlogged with other junky Chrysler products there was no room for another. That speaks volumes about the quality of their vehicles.
