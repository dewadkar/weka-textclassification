            I had to be the first, I bought my new 98 accord first thing in oct. 97..boy did it turn heads!! Why not, great looking sedan, reliable, bigger than most in its class, and fast. I bought my sedan for 18k, it was a lx (which comes standard with auto 2.3l vtec, power locks/windows, am/fm cassette, cruise, pass through rear arm rest, abs, and much more)with a 6 disc changer in the console ( a first for sedans) as the only must option. The experts say it interior is larger than the toyota camry, saturn sl2, nissan maxima, and ford taurus-- I believe them! It was quite spacious with the add space compartments in the doors, dash, glove box and console (which I lost due to the cd changer).  The seats were very comfortable with manual lumbar support. The instrument panel is very eye pleasing and all controls easily reachable.  The controls are effective and self explanatory.  The true pride came from the 2.3 l 4 cyc 150 horsepower vtec. This engine is a gem, fast-smooth-quiet-and great on gas! I averaged about 23 mpg around town and 26 on the highway.  The car's handling was very responsive to the driver. It was quick to correct your stirring and moved well in cornering at high speeds (not that you would).  The ride was firm and the interior had very little road noise.  Some problems I did run into were:  The area behind the rear doors was getting chipped badly due to road sand.  Honda techs looked at it twice and had to re-align the doors and put on mud flaps. They added door jams (color coded) to help protect and deter in the future.  I didn't have the accord long enough to find out if all that work helped.  I miss this car but had to trade it after a great 14 months...I need more space with my 9 month old.  (See my review on my Dodge Grand Caravan).  The other Con was the rear seat didnt have a 60/40 split, it just had the one fold down and a pass through for skis or long objects.  This was a big over-site from Honda.  My accord was traded with 14k miles on it and had no problems except the paint chipping.  This car has plenty of leg room for a family of 4 and the truck can handle lots of luggage.  Unfortunatly it couldnt handle the portacrib, stroller, toys, luggage, and the rest that goes with a 9 month old.  The honda is the best priced vehicle in its class.  I looked and drove them all.  The toyota and maxima was the closest to my liking but the 2500 to 3000 more in cash wasnt worth it.  It's true the maxima has the best v6 in the world but the Honda's 2.3l 4 cyc could give it a good race (beat it if you choice the v6 200 horsepower) and save you $.  I found Honda kept its value better than toyota or nissan.  I owned both.  I lost about 3k in the 14 months I had it but would have lost alot more if I had the others.  I would have recieved the Honda for less but I had to be the first in Nh to buy one and paid about 600 more.  I recommend this car to all my friends that say they are in the market for a sedan, hands down! I would buy this car in a minute if I was in the market for a medium size sedan.  I found I not only saved on gas, I saved on Insurance.  The Honda came out that year with the security system that need the key to start the vehicle. When you shut off the car the fuel system also shuts off and wont turn on unless you have the right key with the micro chip in it.  Nice touch! Most cars and trucks are coming with that technology now.  My 2001 Ford Ranger came with it this yr (Your welcome to see that review as well).  Honda will remodel in 2003 most likely.  Lets hope they keep the same engine, same independent suspension, same simplicity, and same high quality and reliability.  You can't go wrong with a Honda.  I wanted the Honda Odyessy but couldnt pay 1k over msrp so I went with the Dodge, not a bad choice.  Well good luck and happy car shopping.<br><br>
