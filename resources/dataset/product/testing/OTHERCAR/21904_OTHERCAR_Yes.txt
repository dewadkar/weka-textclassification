  After waiting for our BMW 528i to arrive from overseas for a month, it finally happened. The sleek, shiny, titanium chrome craft pulled into our driveway, along with the rest of the neighborhood.
 
   It's design, perfect. It's look, sleek and sexy. When i saw this car i could swear there was an aura of beauty around it. Notice that i have not even entered or driven the car yet. There it was, the BMW we had been waiting for. Coincedentally, i was last in line to test drive it. But when i did get the chance..... well, here's the story.

  I hop into the 528i to go out with my buddy at night. As soon as i sat in the drivers seat i felt as if i was about to take off in a f-15 aircraft. The panel felt so high tech, with it's red LED panel, and all the nifty control buttons on the steering wheel. To make a long story short, i was driving a plane...without wings. As soon as i turned the lights on, 2 red twilight rasers light up the dash area.. I am in heaven.

  As i begin to drive the 528i, i feel as if i control the road. The steering is very powerful and stable. (i might as well be driving on air) 

       In all respect, this is the most perfect vehicle i have ever driven.. it's too bad it's not mine.. maybe, someday. I highly recommend it. <br><br>
