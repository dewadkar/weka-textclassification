            I have had my Nikon 885 for 3 weeks now. Upgraded from a 3 year old Kodak Digital camera.  The 3.2 megapixel image is many times sharper and superior in quality over the 1 megapixel images of the kodak camera and even 2 megapixel cameras.

The Nikon has excellent features for making it simple to take snapshots in snow, daylight, beach and dark scenes as well as sunset scenes. The autofocus while somewhat noisy, works wonderfull.

My favorite part of the camera is battery life. Kodak's are notorious for eating 4 AA batteries in a matter of a few pictures, the Nikon 885 came with a rechargeable battery and charger and you can buy non rechargeable batteries as well.

The size is a bit small for my taste, having big hands it is easy to have a finger in the way or just forget you have a camera on you and that can make it easy to loose.  On the other hand, it is easy to fit in your pocket, light around your neck and small enough you don't need a huge case to lug it around!

I have been through many cameras, and for the price/performance this one is superb.  Excellent picture quality, fast saves (don't need to wait 30 seconds between each picture), tons of features, and a great price to boot.

If you have the extra bucks, get the 995, but if you want a superb camera, at a superb price, the 885 can't be beat.
