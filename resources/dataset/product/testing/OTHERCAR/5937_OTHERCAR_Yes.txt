            I recently purchased a used 1994 Mirage and I am very happy with my purchase. I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it. I didn't even want to leave it there to go get money. I was afraid someone else would buy it.
Driving this car is a great feeling, it's so smooth and quiet. The gas mileage is great also. The shape of the car is nice, it's comfortable and spacious inside. What I most love about this car is the capability of being able to bring the backseat down  and show the trunk making it possible to carry large items without a problem. since we don't have a truck,it works out perfect for us. We have a car and truck in one! It would be very difficult for me to ever let go of this car.<br><br>
