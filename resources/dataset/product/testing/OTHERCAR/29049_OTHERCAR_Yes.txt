            I bought the car for three reasons:  AWD, style, and power.  The AWD is excellent.  

It has no problems making it up our steep snow-covered driveway in the winter--something FWD cars could only dream about.  

The style is wonderfully unique.  I've had the car for three years and still get comments about it.  The windows can be a challenge at drive-up ATMs, but not having the wind blow your face off while driving &gt; 40mph makes it worth it.  

The car has a good amount of power and does 0-60 in 6.9 - 7.2 depending on the reviewer.  It also handles extremely well.  

The cockpit ergonomics are also very good.  Switches and buttons just feel right, and all of the gauges are easily visible through the steering wheel.  Features like windshield wipers that speed up as the car speeds up, the rear intermittent wiper, automatic climate control, and the nifty radio cover all get a big &quot;thumbs-up&quot; for the gadget factor.  The radio cover may sound a little goofy, but my previous car was broken into because I forgot to take the removable radio face with me one night.  <br><br>
