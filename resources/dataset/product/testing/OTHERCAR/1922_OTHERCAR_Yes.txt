            I have previously written an opinion on the Nissan Altima and how it was money well spent.  Well, my wife and I have recently stepped up to the 2000 Maxima GLE and it too is money well spent.

My wife had wanted a 5 speed SE, but since Nissan only makes a limited number of those and only in certain colors (none of which she liked) we chose the GLE instead... and what a choice it was... this car is incredible.  (The GLE in an automatic is cheaper than a SE automatic and has more standard equipment.)

The initial throttle response is not as good on the automatic as it is on the 5 speed, but it's only 8 tenths of a second slower in 0-60... so it obviously has little impact on the top end.  What is truly amazing is that a car with 222 hp and that kind of speed (7.5 second 0-60) is so remarkably quiet and smooth.  You can take off from a stop light and not even worry about spilling your morning coffee.  And don't worry about stopping... the 4 wheel disk abs are more than enough to stop you at that next light and still not spill the coffee.

The interior is outstanding.  The front seats offer tremendous side back support and are VERY COMFORTABLE.  The automatic climate control should be standard on every vehicle made.  It regulates the temperature and fan speed so well that my wife doesn't have to 'play' with the controls at all.  Possibly the best feature is the Bose stereo system... concert hall sound is an understatement.  This stereo is crystal clear and provides the best quality of sound I have ever heard in a car stereo (or a home stereo for that matter).  All of the gauges are easy to read and all of the controls are within easy reach of the driver.

I have heard some negatives about the exterior styling, and I must admit that it had to grow on me; but I think this in one of the best designed and engineered cars on the road.  The only drawbacks that I see are 1)Nissan recommends premium unleaded... we have used mid-grade to this point with no problems and 2)if the driver does NOT get out to pump fuel or open the truck the driver side door remote openers are in an awkward location... you have to open the door to reach them.

Everyone will form their own opinion on the Nissan Maxima, but I think that for what we paid for it we got the same luxury and sophistication as a much more expensive European or Japanese car (Mercedes or Lexus).  Give the Maxima a try... I really don't think you will be disappointed.<br><br>
