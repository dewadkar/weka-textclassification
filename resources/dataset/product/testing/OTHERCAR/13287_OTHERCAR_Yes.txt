               My first new car was the 1999 Honda Accord Sedan. I was very impressed at first look by the sporty car look and luxury feel. The seats are very easy to relax back in, you feel like you can drive for hours with no discomfort. 
   The base engine is a surprisingly powerful 135 horsepower 4-cylinder. Also available is a 150 horsepower 4 cylinder, or a 200 horsepower 6-cylinder. I love the power you feel even behind the smaller base engine, and the engine really has a great purr. The only problem i have really seen in the automatic is that it has a tendency to shift hard, mainly from first to second and second to third. Aside from that, it is very responsive, and quick to jump. It really satisfies the need of the teenage soul or the elder persons need for room and comfort. You can't lose! This is without a doubt the most fun i've ever had driving a car.  I am confident enough in this car to describe it as pure, smooth-riding automotive bliss. Ladies and gentlemen, your faithful chariot awaits!
