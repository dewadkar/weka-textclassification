            I leased a '97 Lincoln Continental for two years. For the most part it was an enjoyable ride. My real complaints were with the dealer on the bell's and whistle's I ordered. They installed the multi-disc player in the trunk instead of the center console for easier access. I had a moon roof installed in which I discovered it leaked during the first rain. I barely had enough time to have it repaired before I was to have it transported to my assignment to Seattle. They were, to say the least...accommodating when it came to making these repairs. 

The car was one of the best I have had during this two year and a few months more time period. It's handling and highway performance were above par. One concern I had was the wind noise. I thought there was more than there should be for a 43k car! It also gave ride options...Firm, Normal and Plush handling. I noticed no real difference with any of these. The sound system was excellent, however. The memory seating was a nice feature, but I could have done without it. Especially, any passenger sitting behind me when the seat would slide all the way back automatically! I would own another one due to it's reliability, comfort and reputation. <br><br>
