            Before I got got my driver's license, I wanted to have a car, just like every other kid.  I didn't need anything flashy, but just something that would get me there.  But I got better than that.  A Pontiac Bonneville.  My mother pointed the car out to me one day.  I knew I wanted it!  My mom helped me get my finances in order, and helped me buy it.  Ever since I've had this car, I've been extremely happy with it.  I have not had to put a lot of money into it besides the regular oil change and some new tires.  The car runs great and starts every time, even though it's 10 years old and has 175,000 miles on it.  It's roomy too.  not one of those cramped little sports cars.  I'm talking leg room here!  If you are looking to buy a used car, I highly recommend the Bonneville!<br><br>
