            Purchased a Bonneville SE from CarsDirect in May 2001. Was
going to purchase a Grand Prix because of its sportier look,
but decided a Bonneville was worth the extra few thousand dollars for its roominess and smoother ride.
My favorite options are the radio and CD controls on the
steering wheel. The one option my wife loves are the heated
leather seats. On frigid mornings here in southern California I will use the heated seats instead of the heater. The air conditioning works well, but the controls
took a little time to get used to. Having dual air settings
is a great idea.
Acceleration is ample for a large vehicle. Handles good.
Average about 20 mpg on mostly city driving.
Have not had to take the vehicle to the dealership for any
defects. Only problem was a "low tire pressure warning" on
the dashboard. When I checked the tires, they were fine and
the warning never reappeared.
