            I recently purchased a new 2000 Dodge Durango Sport in February 2000.  I was not sure if I wanted to purchase a Dodge Durango or a Ford Expedition.  After driving each and pricing the type of vehicle I wanted, the Dodge Durango prevailed.  I love so many things about it, I don't know where to start.  I have 10-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, and this vehicle makes it so much easier on our whole family.  The drive of the Durango is so much like a car but better.  The steering is so sharp and smooth.  I have grey cloth interior which I like better than leather.  The outside is Pewter (silver) in color which is so nice since it does not show dirt as much as the other colors.  I have had a lot of compliments on the color from complete strangers who see me in a parking lot of a business.  My Durango has the 3rd seat, rear a/c, power windows &amp; locks, am/fm cassette with CD player, tilt/cruise, and alarm system.  I have the 60/40 tumble seats in the center which I absolutely love.  The kids can pop the seats up to get into the rear seat with no problem.  That is where they like to ride anyway.  If you have children, want to take another couple with you when you go somewhere, and have errands to do with either, this is the vehicle for you.  So much room for whatever your needs are.  I found the best price at La Grange Motors in La Grange, Texas.  If interested, go see Wally.  He will give you a deal that you will be happy with.  Love it!!!<br><br>
