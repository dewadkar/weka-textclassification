            If you want cubholders, good AC, and comfortable seats, get a Lexus.
If you want a sportscar, get an air cooled 911. At some point, 911s and Lexi have intersected with the 996, which, in my opinion, has lost what being a 911 is all about. The 993, made from 1995 to 1998 is the last true 911 sportscar, I think. The 84-89 3.2s represent the bread and butter of 911 evolution.

210 HP on a stock body, without mods, may not be enough by today's standard. But with the right modifications, an 84 Carrera will spank most other Ricers, and mine does regularly.
I immediately removed the AC system, including hoses except for the front blower (only 1 lbs, so who cares), put in a modified dual RS style muffler, chip, short shifter, removed rear seat back and deadening material. I also replaced the cat with a test pipe.
I then ridded the car of the front and rear bumpers, replacing them with all glass RUF front and IROC rear. I also added 964 Rocker panels. In total, I lost nearly 200 lbs in those modification alone while also losing nearly all the rubber on the car.
My 84 Carrera comes in at a lean 2,460 lbs on a half-tank of gas, and is eeking out close to 230 HP. Where stock it did 0-60 in 6.3 seconds (measured on G-Tech), it now does 0-60 in 5.5 seconds (same device), which is enough to scare new 996s and will easily spank most rice burners.

I added a factory Carrera tail just for fun and the car feels great at over 120 mph (top speed of 151mph).
With 176k miles and some valve noise, it will be due for a rebuild over the next 2 years. At that time, I will put in more aggressive cams and some other mods that will likely bring the car up to 240 HP. At that point, I will have to look hard for ricers that can top it.
Remember, increasing HP is nice, but you must reduce weight. A car coming in at 2460 lbs and anything over 220 HP will stake its claim at any stoplight even though 911s are traditionally poor light-to light racers.
