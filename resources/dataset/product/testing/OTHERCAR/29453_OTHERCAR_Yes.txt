            I bought my '99 Jeep Wrangler Sport being I live and drive on country roads.  I need a vehicle that could withstand the punishment of rocky, muddy, and bumpy roads.  I traded in my Chevy Cavalier for this Jeep being my Cavalier would not and could not make it up my driveway in the Winter.  The trade was the best move I ever made.
With the Jeep and it's 4x4 capabilities, I fly up the driveway as though the snow did not exists.  This is my first Jeep and I fell in love with it during my test drive with it.  Very easy to steer and control, although with the hardtop, the Jeep is somewhat hard to control in wind storms.  The only drawback I see to driving a Jeep is it tends to be a bumpy ride.  Almost like being thrown side to side.  But you get used to it after a while.  I think there is more than enough room up front and room for passengers.  However, there definitely is no room for cargo or groceries if you do have passengers in the back.  Then again, Jeeps weren't built for trips to the grocery store.  You can definitely have fun in a Jeep when you take the top off in the summer. The Jeep would not be considered a family car.  <br><br>
