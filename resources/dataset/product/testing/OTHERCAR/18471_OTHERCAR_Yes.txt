            The press and automotive world have been building up the release of the long awaited Lexus IS300.  I recently took a test drive of a 2002 IS300 and was very impressed with the car.  

First of all, this car looks great.  It has a muscular lean appearence that gives it a sports car look.  The 17 inch wheels further the sporty look of this machine.  The rear tail lights are clear, which is a somewhat trendy look, but looks good on this car.  Lexus definetely went away from its traditionaly conservative look and made this car look edgier and sportier to attract young buyers between the age of 25-40 into its dealerships.

When you step inside the IS300, you are welcomed by the trendy, upscale look of a black interior with great looking carbon trim.  The seats in this model were the leather/escain combo which provide superior grip for tight cornerning.  The seats also have great side bolstering, which hold you comfortably in place during spirited driving.  The instrument panel is chronagraph style which is very untraditional, but looks good, although it can be hard to read at quick glances.  This car is classified as a compact sport sedan, which means it isn't tremoundously big inside, but it can comfortably fit 4, and squeeze 5 for short trips.  

Driving this car is a pure joy.  The inline 6 cylinder engine is rated a 215hp and scoots the IS300 to 60mph in around 7 seconds.  The model I drove was an automatic with up and downshift buttons mounted on the steering wheel.  This automanual system is quite fun, although not quite as good as a true manual system.  But it provides crips up and downshifts and I recommend it.  This car does not ride as smooth as most other Lexus cars, due to its sports tuned supension and 17 inch wheels.  But it handles a lot better than any other Lexus product, so just decide if you want a soft ride, or good handling.  I drove the car in winter conditions and it is not the best winter driving car.  It is rear-wheel drive and sometimes it has problems getting good traction.  Also, the gas mileage is just average at 18 city and 25 highway.  

Although I did not buy this car, I am considering it along with some other vehicles.  I would recommend this car to a young professional who wants a sporty, fast car that has the convience of 4 doors.  It is definetely a great looking car and it is built with excellent Lexus quality, so you won't be dissapointed.
