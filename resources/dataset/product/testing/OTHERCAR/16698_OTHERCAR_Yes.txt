            The cost of film and developing has always been my biggest concern.  Before CD-Rs and CD-RWs, there was the 3.5-inch diskette.  After having lived through the 90s, I've amassed thousands and thousands of them.  After looking into the FD85, I realized that my film problem had been solved.  I have enough "floppy" rolls to last me a lifetime.

In case you haven't yet caught on, the beauty of the Mavica line is that it uses regular 3.5-inch diskettes for media.  If you've already got diskettes, you're all set.  No need to buy expensive flash cards, memory sticks, readers, etc. that other manufacturers require for their cameras.

I do an extensive amount of traveling.  This is where the the Mavica line excels.  You no longer need to worry about having to buy expensive film abroad.  You don't have to worry about film getting damaged in airport x-ray machines.  The single most versatile aspect of the camera is that you can view or send your images immediately.  There are more Internet cafes now than ever.  Every computer in these cafes is bound to have at least a floppy drive.  Just log on to your email account and attach your image files.  I don't know about the versatility of flash or memory stick, but I imagine it can't be any better than floppy.

Now to the pros and cons.  First the pros.  The camera is very easy to use.  I am never one to read instruction manuals from front to back unless I'm really stuck.  Fiddling with the it for about 15 minutes is enough to acquaint one's self with the camera.  Just aim, adjust the zoom, and press and hold the button.  The camera is also very inexpensive.  I bought mine for only $380.  I have not had to buy anything else for it since.  Again, media for this camera is very affordable.

The FD85 is not a great camera for indoor photography.  It is nearly useless when taking photos inside museums, churches, etc.  Another thing I don't like about the FD85 is its delayed shutter.  You need to press and hold the button to take a picture.  As a result it's not the ideal camera for action shots.  Finally, the battery that the camera comes with it lasts for only 90 minutes.  I find myself having to recharge it every night, if not twice a day.
