            I used to own a 1992 Eclipse with the 8-valve 1.8L engine(92 HP). This car was by no means a performance machine like it's bigger 2.0L turbocharged brother, but it was still a blast to drive and looked great. I'd call this an econo/sports car. I consistently received 30+ mpg city/highway and nearly 40 mpg highway only, and never got tired of banging through the gearbox. Like many DSM's (eclipse/talon/laser), the transmission felt sloppy, and it had a slight grind going into second. I also had a leaky head gasket, and the car also burned oil. I had to add a quart at almost every fill-up of gas.

On this car, I had to replace the lifters of the hatchback. This is a very common problem on these cars, haven't met a person who hasn't replaced these. I believe the lifters were ~$25 each. I also added a K&N air filter (~$35) to this car, modified the air filter housing, and changed the shift knob (the stock "trigger" style knob is horrible). The second generation eclipse shift knob fits quite nicely, and shortens the throw a little bit. This car only seemed to have acceleration in the low to mid RPM range. I thought the K&N filter would help in the high RPM range, didn't seem to do a whole lot though. The modified air filter housing and K&N really made the car sound great though, you can hear the air rushing into the engine.

Handling was OK (I autocrossed with this vehicle). The small tires weren't all that great, I replaced them with larger 16x8 wheels. You can certainly feel the road with that size of wheel. For normal city/highway driving, the stock wheel size is fine. Disc brakes on all four wheels really stops the car in a hurry. I was pleased to see discs on all wheels; many compact cars have rear drums, which do a decent enough job. Autocrossing with full disc brakes in a lightweight car brought it to stop very quickly. I also replaced all brake pads. This was a very straight forward task; definitely easy maintenance.

Cargo space for this type of car is what's expected, there isn't much. This is a small sports car so cargo space is not a problem for me, I knew what I was getting. Rear seats are small, this is quite all right. If you want a car with more room/larger rear seat, buy a minivan. I'm 6'1" tall and I had no problem with room in the front seats. They weren't plush by any means, but this is also isn't a Buick. The seats were quite fine for extended road trips. The rear seats also fold down allowing plenty of room for you and a friend's luggage. HVAC controls are all in one spot, just below the dash. All controls are within reach and can be adjusted while driving without being a distraction. The dash board seemed like it was mounted quite high, somewhat restricting view of the road. You'll see what I mean if you currently drive a more "open" car with few blind spots.

I ultimately had to sell the car because of the oil problem; I needed something more reliable, so I bought a Honda. If you take care of this car, change its oil often, drive it nicely (unlike I did), then this car will treat you right. These cars are now getting quite old, and many owners have beaten on them (especially the turbocharged models) and a nicely driven low-mileage DSM is getting difficult to happen upon. If you are looking for a fun economy car, I recommend the 1.8L as long as it has low miles and has been driven by a single owner. If you are looking for a beast, then get the turbo AWD DSM. If you are looking for cargo space and nice back seats, look elsewhere (once again, this is a sports car, not a minivan).
