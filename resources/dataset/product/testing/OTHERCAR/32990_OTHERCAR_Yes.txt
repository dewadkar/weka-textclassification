            This car met more than any expectation I had for it. This is my first SUV. I have the 2001 Yukon SLT. I am so impressed with this truck its all I wanted and more. I did extensive research when I set out to buy and it beat out all the competition both in its class and above as far as value for the buck. My heart was set on the lincoln navigator at first but the yukon beat it out in price as well as options. The yukon comes Standard equipped with more options than the Navigator and prices at about $10,000 less. The new body is beautiful, I prefer it over the denali which is in my opinion too boxy and over priced. The Yukon has every thing that the denali offers but woodgrain, larger tires, and a slightly bigger engine which will account for worse gas milage.
Ive test drove just about every major SUV out and the Yukon comes the closest to driving like a car. Its a smooth ride which makes you appreciate driving again. I havent had so much fun driving since I first got my licence.
The sound system is impecible. Ive attempted to see what its limits were but was unable to. Its just to loud. 
It has a sensor which switches the vehicle from the day lights to the night lights when it gets dark. 
Onstar comes up clearly through the speakers when a call is made. And is very receptive to the tone of your voice.
In four wheel drive it seems this truck can go through anything. I have driven in a blizzard where every vehicle on the road was forced to drive at a creaping pace of no more than 10 miles an hour, and this truck was driving through the snow as if it were normal conditions. 
After hearing all the horror stories about V8 SUV's and their gas guzzling I was prepared for the worse. One of the greatest features of this vehicle is that allows you the option of driving in 2WD or Auto. While in this mode this truck is not bad on gas. Not for a SUV at least. It has a 25 gallon tank, 5 of those gallons are reserve. I drive 20 miles to work every day and 20 miles home and I fill up once in a 5 day week. Thats 200 miles not to mention, the little driving here and their for errands. In my oppinion thats great!
This is by far GMC best vehicle yet! The 2001 Yukon should be the new bench mark for SUV's.
