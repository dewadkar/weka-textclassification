            This car is so often overlooked, yet it is stylish, well-built, powerful, luxurious, well-priced, and it has an added cache because there are not that many on the road! Yes, the new Q45 is not quite as sporty and taut as the previous model, but this is a no-compromise built car. There is something about this car that just makes you feel good..it is soothing and in control and everything fits just right...maybe even a dose of serenity. But when you want to change all that, and get some power going, it responds very well, with aplomb. Don't be thinking high performance however. This car handles borderline luxo-barge, it's not a BMW ripsnorter. 

I constantly get comments about this stylish car and everyone enjoys a ride. Buy it if you want to make a style statement that also says you want everything balanced and well put together but not overstated. Everything just so.

So what's not to like? Well, like I said the handling is good, but German does better. Nothing has gone wrong with this car...NOTHING. It is loaded with features (like the automatic Xenon headlights and the rear window sunshade). Just one or two little lapses in logic...the auto power down front window isn't auto power up...huh? even my VW does that. The memory power seat remembers everything, but I have to adjust the rear view mirror every time my wife has driven the car. Well...I think that is about all that is wrong...

Nothing to hate. Period. Just decide if you want a big luxury car that is not as common as everyone else's and is available at a better price (e.g. a lot less than the vanilla boring Lexus LS400). 

The only problem with these cars is that the used car market doesn't yet fully appreciate them, and first year depreciation hit is a little tough. Hang in there...keep the car long-term...it will never offer any trouble, always be satisfying, and always make a style statement. All that a a fair price. <br><br>
