            I am 21 years old and decided to buy my first real new car and I was looking through a wired magazine and low and behold their is the ad for the volvo s40 right before my eyes. I test drove it and the handling was terrific! All the controls from the steering to the brakes are very tight and responsive. I also like the design of the volvo's seats very much. I am a large guy about six feet and 250 pounds and I fit comfortably in this car in any of the four seat positions. I also liked the volvo premium sound system very much. It is well worth the extra money and it is nice how they incorporate both cassette and cd player in the internal console stereo. I also like the neat cubby spaces that volvo has nicely placed throughout the interior. The cup holders adjust even to king or super size drinks from the local fast food joint. I also very much like the trunk with the seat belt and cargo net so, your groceries do not spill out by tiping over. I did not like the paint it seems to have way too many scratches in it for having the car only 3 months. I think anyone looking for a safe and sporty car should drive and buy a volvo s40. Did I mention it comes with dual frontal and side air bags with steel safety cage! I also am a volunteer fire fighter and paramedic and this car with the turbo charged engine moves extremely well! Can we say  speed anyone? I also put flashing blue strobes and a siren in it and it does not even strain the electrical system. Nothing like it for 28000 grand with options!<br><br>
