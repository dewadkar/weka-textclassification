            I own a 98 Grand Am Se. I bough it back in March of 98. I love this car. Thers nothing really flashing about it. but the twin cam engine gives me the power I need every now and then. This is the first car I have owned. Nothing has gone wrong with it. it Dec of 99 now. I do have high mileage on the car with 50,000 but. With the routine oil changes and reagular checks. THis vehicle was the best I have purchased. I like pontiac products. I have gotten anywhere from 325 to 425 miles to a tank of gas. it depends on how hard the engine is ran. I stand 6 feet tall and the room in the car is great. No more cramped legs<br><br>
