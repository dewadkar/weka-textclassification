            My husband and I just bought a 2000 Saturn SL2.  I love this car.  When I first saw the car I thought it was so cute, and then when I drove it I knew that I had to have it.  It looks good, rides good, and was affordable.  The other thing I liked when I purchased the car was the customer service at the lot and even after we purchased the car.  I mean these people send us cookies, letter asking us how we like the car, and they even invite us to parties with other Saturn owners.
This car is a good buy for a young to middle age person (my mom says it sits low to the ground).  It has a good amount of room and I enjoy the fact that it has four doors.  
Overall, this car is an excellent buy and I would recommend it to anyone that's looking for a compact or sub-compact car.<br><br>
