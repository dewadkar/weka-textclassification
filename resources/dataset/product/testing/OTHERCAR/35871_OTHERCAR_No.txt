            First off, for the price, a 1990 Chevrolet Lumina is a decent car to consider.  Consumer Reports has given this model kind reviews for as long as I can remember.  This car is sufficient for everyday driving and would be good for a person who is restricted by a budget.  The overall ride is smooth, though for a taller person this car is quite cramped.  For a person 6'4'' such as myself, this car would not be the greatest for leg room.  The front seats are combined into one big bench seat, and for a tall person this is not very comfortable.  The engine is quite peppy (161 HP V6), and has never required attention.  The steering is above average and the brakes work well when they are new.  Beware, this car is notorious for having very poor brake reliability.  This is the worst car I have ever seen for brake repairs.  On average I would have to get the brakes fixed at least once a year.  The repair costs for the brakes are high and these can add up over time.  Aside from the brakes, the rear seats are cushioned well and comfortable, except there could be a bit more leg room.  The trunk is spacious and you could carry some large objects if need be.  The car has above average winter driving capabilities, and traction is great at low to moderate speeds in slippery conditions.  One major plus for this vehicle was the fact that it took 12 years for the body to show rust.  It was parked outside through its entire lifespan and that shows the great quality of the paintjob.  
Overall, this car is priced low and reliability is quite good, but I would recommend finding a good, reliable foreign car.
