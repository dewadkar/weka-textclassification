            I received this camera as a gift and was initially very impressed. The photos were good and the software easy to use. The camera performed well. I especially liked hooking it up to my TV and viewing pictures of my son. I also liked the controls and the fact that I could turn the flash on or off at will.

Unfortunately, I began to experience a problem after a couple of weeks. When I got the camera, I could turn the flash on or off as I wanted. I decided to try setting the camera flash to automatic so that camera would turn on the flash when needed. The flash did not always come on when it should have and picture quality suffered. I attempted to turn the auto-flash feature off and restore the camera to its original settings. Although I used the camera's software to turn the auto flash on, the same software would not turn it off.

I contacted Agfa support via email. They told me that the auto flash was the normal default setting and could not be changed. I informed them that when the camera arrived, the auto flash setting was not on but that I had turned it on after using the camera for two weeks without it. They agreed that there was hardware problem and urged me to contact telephone support.

The customer service rep had no record of my problem. So, I had to explain it again. I was put on hold 4 times and kept waiting for nearly an hour. When it was all said and done, I was informed that the auto flash could not be turned off. Although I explained the situation and even made reference to the email admitting the problem was hardware related, I was basically told, &quot;Too bad!&quot;
