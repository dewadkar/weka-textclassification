            Whatever you've heard in the past about American-made cars being of 
lower-quality and poor reliability, get ready to toss those thoughts out 
the window.  My 1994 Saturn SL2 has proven to be a car of outstanding 
reliability.  I bought the vehicle used over 3 years ago and the only 
engine part needing replacement in that time was the alternator.  
Originally listing for around $16K the car handles remarkably well in turns, has a nice, solid feel to the wheel, and accelerates as well as any 4-cylinder out there.  The outside plastic/fiberglass body does not rust and resists impacts incredibly well -- it's literally impossible to dent! 

The interior is simple but very functional with all the basic 
requirements met plus a few extras.  One of the few complaints I have about this vehicle is the level of road noise when driving at speeds above 75mph. But vehicle handling at all speeds is very solid.  Overall a great car and a lot of fun to drive -- many of my friends are surprised that with my driving tendencies I'm not driving something more muscular.  But no need because the Saturn strikes a nice balance of performance, feel, and comfort.
