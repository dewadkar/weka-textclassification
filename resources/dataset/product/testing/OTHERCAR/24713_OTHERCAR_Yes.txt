            Just the other day my Toshiba PDR-M4 gave out on me. It started taking, what can only be described as 'blue-scale' pictures. I'm going to leave the rest out and get to the camera...

The first thing I noticed about it was that it was relativly small, hever it is a bit thick. I was unable to purchase a bag for it because of it's dimensions (mainly the rather large lens). That's ok (for now) because it comes with a lens cover.

The pictures are awesome, no matter what resolution you take them in. My PDR-M4 had a problem with taking low-res pictures, but aparently Sony doesn't have this problem.

The movie clip feature kicks ass, my only gripe is that you can only take 15 seconds of video in the two high-res modes (320x240, reg and high quality). The low-res mode can be forced to go for longer (60 sec) by holding the button down. It's a pain in the butt, but at least it can do it.

Since this camera has a set of moving parts for the zoom, it tends to bug me because I often forget to take the lens cap off.

There is also no way to take pictures at a moments notice with it. From power-on to taking of first picture is almost 10 seconds, compared to three with my old camera. Also, there is no burst feature (so you can take pictures like a Japanese tourist) which I also had on my old camera.

It may seem like I am complaining about the camera, well your right. If you pay $799 for a camera, it should be able to do certain things without question. Some things just can't be worked around, so I will have to work on the problems I am having with it. I just wish that the video portion could go for longer that 15 seconds. It's not a limitation of how much space is available on the memory stick, it's a limitation of the camera itself.

All complaints aside, it really is an excellent camera with hours of on-time and simply spectacular picture quality. If you've got pockets deep enough, get it. If not, try a couple models down.<br><br>
