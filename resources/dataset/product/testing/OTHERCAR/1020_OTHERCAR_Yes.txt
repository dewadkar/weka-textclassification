            The reason I bought this vehicle was it seemed different from all the look-a-likes they have out now.  Some friends owned one and they kept recommending it.  When we went to look at vehicles, hated them all, but drove the Intrepid and fell in love with it the first time.  Sleek, low, comfortable and the price was right.  
Body: sleek and gorgeous.
Interior: Comfortable front and back.  Leg room is tremendous in the back as well as the front.  Seats in the front can be adjusted to your liking, up, down, back, forward or lay down.  Long trips are a breeze and we've been on a few.  We quit driving our van on trips, Intrepid much more comfortable.
Gas mileage is nice, especially w/gas being so high.
Love the front wheel drive.  Took it to Colorado in the mountains in November...wonderful..thru snow up to the bottom of the doors. Went thru like a breeze.  Feel safe in it.
This is fully loaded.  We picked it over a 1999, because of the features and the price, of course.  If we ever buy another vehicle, will probably go with a Dodge Intrepid again.
