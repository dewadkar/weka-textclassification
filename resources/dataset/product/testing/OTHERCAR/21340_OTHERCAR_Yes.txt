            The Toyota Camry, what can I say except that I am really in love my mine.  I am 42 years old and got married when I was very young so I never had a chance to really have my first car.  Well, in 1997 we bought a new Toyota Sienna and really love it and that is where I met and feel in love with the car of my dreams, so in 1998 we went back to the Toyota dealer and ordered my 1999 Toyota Camry.  Just so the hubby and I would be sure that this was the car that we wanted we went and test drove other cars in the same class and nothing compared with the ride of the Camry LE V6.  You really do feel like you are riding in the air.  Of course since this was MY FIRST CAR, husband and I debate that sometimes, cause he's fallen in love with it too, we got many features that I wanted so we had to wait 7 weeks for it to come in.  It sure was worth the wait.  We've had it now for a year with no problems whatsoever and everytime I drive it or even look at it I think I fall more in love.  Of course, I had to get the black with the gold and even have a moon roof.  And then this car has got to have the best sound system.  I had to have a CD player too, lol.  I sure can say one thing about this car and that is that my husband and I are both sold bigtime on the Toyota line of cars.  What Quality, and the people are so very pleasant that we deal with.  If anybody wants a car that they are ready to fall in love with then buy the Toyota Camry or for that matter any Toyota line.<br><br>
