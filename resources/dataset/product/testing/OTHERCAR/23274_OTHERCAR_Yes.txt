            This Swift is my first car, I bought it in 1997.

The fuel economy is incredible, about 6.5 liters/100 Km in summer.  This car handling is incredible in town, it's easy to park, to make quick lane change.  When I have to go to the garage with my car, it's only for basic things, I put 500$ a year on repair, don't forget, it's a 10 years old car.  With the 90-94 models you get a lot of cargo room.  My girlfriend have s Swift 95 there is less cargo space.

This car is really noisy, you must have a great sound system when you're on highway!  If you buy a swift, check for the rust, it's the only REAL problem I have with my Swift.  Don't try to go in mountains with a Swift, the engine will cry...

It's a funny car to drive, it's responsive, despite it only have 70 horsepower, you can have a lot of fun driving it.  NOTE : new models have 79 HP.  If you want more power you can buy the GT version, it have 100 HP.

You should buy this vehicle used or new if you are young and on budget or if you need a second reliable and cheap car to do some shopping or to go to work.
