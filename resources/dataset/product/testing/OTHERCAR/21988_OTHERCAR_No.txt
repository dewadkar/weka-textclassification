            I own this vehicle currently and I gotta tell you it is the WORST
car I have EVER owned!  I bought it used (and incidentally after I
did, I read in consumer reports that this is one of the top two cars
they consider the worst to buy used.  The other one is the 1990
Hyundai Excel!)

I bought this car through a friend who is a mechanic and has been
for quite some time.  Even with a new motor, this car has been a 
thorn in my side from day one!  The minor things were just annoying
like the control for the internal dash lights is unstable making the
dash lights flicker too much.

The larger problems are as follows:  The overdrive does not work, it
doesn't engage properly thus the motor overheats (it's an aluminum
block engine) which of course causes other problems.  There is a way
to kick this car from city to country driving, but I haven't seen
where it did anything for the gas mileage at all.)

The only kudos for this vehicle is that when it IS running properly
the gas mileage is wonderful - I was averaging between 27-36 for
a cross between city and country driving.  But this is where my
praise of this vehicle ends!

The car smokes worse than I do, and I have followed other excels down
the road only to see them smoking too, so it's not just my vehicle!
The thermostat is unstable, and it seems that if it sits for a little 
while (Less than 2 months) the brakes will lock into place.

I paid $1200 for this car (which at the time was 1/2 of the blue book
value) but I have also put over $600 into it since I bought it just
about 2 years ago.  I think this is more than just a bit ridiculous!
I am about as unhappy about this vehicle for letting me down every 
time I have turned around as I can possibly be!

I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to my worst enemy!  To top things
off, we've had consistent problems with the alternator and the
air conditioning (which still doesn't work).

I have only been able to drive this car for about 1 year of the two
that I've had it because it has either been in and out of the shop
and undriveable, or because of the overheating problem, I couldn't
take it out of the town I live in.  Repeatedly, the motor has simply
stopped.  No explanation, only to start again anywhere from 20
minutes later (again no explanation) to 1 month later.

If you are looking for a good used car, do NOT trust this one, or if
you do, make SURE you have a very trusted mechanic look it over with
a fine toothed comb.  I'm sure there are probably some good ones out
there, but this MoonBeam can't afford to keep running this vehicle.

If you are looking for a good push, tow or tug trade in, then by all
means pick this one out, it won't let you down there!
