            When looking for a new-used vehicle, I had a few criteria that I was looking for:

1. Must be able to drive in bad weather.
2. Must be able to seat at least 5 people (2 adults + 3 kids in car seats)
3. Trunk must be large.
4. Not a mini-van or station wagon.
5. Cost under $20,000

When it came down to the final decision, the decision had already been made. The Subaru Legacy Sedan was the only vehicle that fit all of the criteria listed above.

This vehicle also has other qualities that make it a great family car. Gets pretty good gas mileage considering it is all time all wheel drive. Other features such as AC, automatic windows, 4 speaker stereo, cruise control, and child door locks, make this a well rounded vehicle that is easy to drive and a little more sporty looking.

So when you are looking for a vehicle to fit the entire family in and you are looking for safety, the Subaru Legacy is a great choice.
