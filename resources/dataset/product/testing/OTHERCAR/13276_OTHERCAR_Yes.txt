             After three years of ownership my decision to purchase our 1999 Accord LX has never felt better. The car is as tight and noise free as day one. 

 The mileage has been getting even better over time. I recently measured an accurate 43 mpg on the highway cruising at 65 mph. I should mention that the mileage is based on our imperial gallon which is slightly larger than the U.S. gallon. The mileage was measured by filling the tank until the first shut off of the pump and then driving a measured distance (285 miles) with my GPS and refilling at the same gas station immediately upon return. 

 The car has never had to experience a visit to the garage other than for regular maintenance. An interesting fact, at least here in Canada, is that Honda parts are probably the lowest priced of most imports and domestics. The Canadian Automobile Association determined this through their own independant survey.

 I love the interior colour scheme of the '99 Accords. They are bright and cheerful and have a classy look to them. The same cannot be said of the newer Accords, as for some reason Honda reverted to the gloomy charcoal look that every other maker seems to prefer. The interior is also spacious and the trunk cavernous. I just wish the seats were a bit more comfortable on the long hauls.

 I still admire the understated look of this generation of Accord. While some feel the style is bland, there is no doubt that this series will age gracefully into the future. I personally detest gimicks, especially when it comes to automotive design. The 6th generation Accord has a quiet look of taste matched to capability.

 With reference to handling and road manners, my Accord gives both my wife and myself a true sense of confidence and safety. The downside is the car actually becomes a bore to drive on long stretches of good highway. The car basically stays where you point it. When it comes to rough and uneven surfaces as well as the twisties the Accord irons the wrinkles out with authority.
