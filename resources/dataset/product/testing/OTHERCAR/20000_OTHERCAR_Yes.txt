            The Lexus ES 300 is a wonderful luxury car that is sure to outdo your expectations.  Lexus is renowned for its outstanding service and commitment to its buyers.  The ES 300 is a prime example of this consideration.  Build sturdily, the car is roomy with a responsive climate control.  On scorching summer days, it takes only a few seconds for the car to cool me down.  The interior is genuine leather.  While the 6 CD changer is not standard, it is well-worth buying to complement the wonderful sound system included in the car.  The seats are very comfortable and easily adjustable.
What really sets this vehicle apart, however, is the ride!  In addition to being the quietest ride I have ever encountered, it is unbelievably smooth.  Driving through heavy city traffic over potholes is as peaceful as gliding down a country road.  The engine noise is greatly deadened by a special blanket under the hood.  The steering, as in many foreign cars, is very sensitive which may or may not appeal to all drivers.
Overall, the car has outdone all of my expectations and is definitely worth every penny of its steep price.<br><br>
