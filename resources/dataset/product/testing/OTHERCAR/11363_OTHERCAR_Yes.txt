            Dodge Caravan is a great minivan. Very comfortable seats and driver console. Good stereo system. Smooth ride even on bumpy streets. Dual sliding doors are a must, especially if you have kids. The engine could pack a little more punch though. It seems like there isn't enough power sometimes. I have a tow package on mine and it seems to have trouble pulling my boat. Lots of hauling space in the rear compartment. I'm not too crazy about the forest green color but other than that it is a very good vehicle. Changing the seats around was pretty easy too.

Overall I would recommend buying this minivan, especially if you have kids or will be hauling a lot of stuff around town.<br><br>
