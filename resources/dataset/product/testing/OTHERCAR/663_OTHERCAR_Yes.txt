            I bought my Nikon Coolpix 950 through Amazon.com (the site that gets e-commerce!). 

At first I took the worst pictures. Everything was all blurred and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Well, I was taking photo's of my newborn twins - and they were constantly moving causing the picture to blur. Without knowing it I was only using the automatic mode of the camera. There is also a mode that lets you set the shutter speed, aperture, etc (believe me I'm a real novice at this) --- and within 15 minutes of reading the manual, I was making the shutter speed faster and getting fantastic pictures!

I bought a SansMedia 96MB Compact Flash card from http://www.cameraworld.com. This holds many more pictures than the 8 mb card included with the camera. I also bought the SansMedia USB Compact Flash card reader which hooked right to my computer USB port and let me transfer images as if the flash card was a hard disk (highly recommended!).

I also went to Radio Shack and bought 1500 mah NIMH (DON'T get NICADS) and a 2 hour speedy charger. You will need rechargeable batteries because the camera eats through regular AA's like candy (about 20 pictures with flash).

I'm extremely pleased with the picture this camera generates. I think you will almost certainly have to use the manual mode and adjust things like shutter speed to get the most out of it.

Using the manual mode is a GREAT learning experience too because you can see what adjusting things like shutter speed will do to a picture.<br><br>
