            My dad was looking for a second car for me to drive.  I needed something to commute to college with and also do things while he was at work such as pick up my mother from work.  We looked at the Ford Taurus and the Chevy Lumina as well but we had limited space in the driveway for cars so big.  We checked out the Chrysler Cirrus and it seems to give people less problems than the Ford Taurus of the same year.  Since we've gotten this car (around August 2002), the only problems we have with the car is a broken gas gauge (which was broken since we bought it), and the right side view mirror doesn't work.  The transmission also makes a sort-of-ratcheting sound.  That seems to be a Chrysler thing and the car runs fine despite that.

There's plenty of room.  I've been in a Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Ford Taurus and I feel more comfortable in the Cirrus (I won't lie...the back of the Taurus is a little bigger).  The passenger seat in the Cirrus seems a little cramped but the drivers seat is great (and I'm 6'0" 270 lbs).  Since the back seat folds down it seems to shift a little and cause a bumping sound.  

I have the 2.5L V6 and it never disappoints.  It does take a while to reach 60 mph (10.5 according to Chrysler) but after that and you have to focus on keeping the speed down a little.  The cornering is great and it's so easy to handle.  I drove my dad's Expedition before and this is a breath of fresh air.  I also drove the driving school's 95 Honda Civic and my friend's 95 Corolla and this is much better.  After 109,006 miles, (I bought it at 106,592) this is great!

The car has a weak paint job.  I can see spots where the paint is weakening but I'm glad it's not to the point where its rusting.

UPDATE:

Around 8/2003, I had to get the water pump, power steering belt, drive belt, and timing belt replaced.  Only the water pump had failed (coolant leak might be an early sign but it could be a sign of something else) but all of those belts have to be removed to get to it and since it had about 114,700 miles at the time it was a good idea to replace them.

The bumping sound I mentioned earlier isn't coming from the back seat.  It's something under the car and I haven't determined what it is yet.  So far I'm the only one with this car with this problem.

I still recommend this car though.  I consider that all part of maintaining a 100,000+mile car.
