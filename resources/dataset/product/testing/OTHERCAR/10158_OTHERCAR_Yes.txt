            This is really an opinion on Nissan &quot;the company&quot; and not the SUV Pathfinder.  Recently, Nissan had a Test drive promotion, if you test drove a 2000 Pathfinder and the salesman signed your form, available on there website, Nissan would send you a really super nice picnic back pack kit. Well, to make a long story short, A friend and myself went to do the test drive and after learning we really had no intentions of buying  a Pathfinder that day, the salesman refused to sign our form, because he said it would bring down his &quot;score&quot; of test drives to sales. The more I thought about this salesman and his remarks, the more upset I got, so I just sit down and wrote Nissan a letter telling them what had happened to me that day. 
     Well, after several weeks and no response, I was really upset with Nissans customer service. And low and behold I come home from the store today and there is a big box on my front porch and guess what's in that box... A Nissan test drive picnic backpack. So needless to say, Nissan's customer service is now A+ to me.
