            I am currently 16, 17 next month. My dad found me a victory red two-door Tahoe in late 99. My mom drove it for some time while I was still on a learners permit. Finally my day came when I got my liscense and it was all mine. It came with some oversized tires and wheels on it, which I wouldn't recommend unless you plan on a lot of off roading because it multiplies the rear end gears so your off the line power isn't so great and for stop and go driving. However if you do a lot of highway driving I've been getting 16 mpg going to california last summer. Although, on the other side of the coin I'm getting about 11 mpg stop and go driving. One major thing I didn't like about it origionally is that it was incredibley under powered. Freeing up the exhaust did a lot. First thing I did was change the muffler to a flowmaster. This added power and made it sound cooler. The catalytic converter was also replaced with a new one. I bought a K&amp;N air filter (which is really nice for dusty off roading because it is reusable). The most significant power modification I did was to replace the exhaust manifolds, which had an exhaust leak anyways, with some headers I bought from Summit for about $200 with unbreakable gaskets. The finaly modification I did was to add a superchip to the computer. Honestly this did very little if anything to preformance, but it helped on the gas mileage. Now my Tahoe can keep up with the stock 96 to 98 models with the vortec engines. The vehicle itself is quite comfortable. My one biggest complaint is that the engines red line is 4000 RPM, which is the max it will go to even if you try to manually shift it. The drivers seat is descent enought for long trips, but as far as the passengers and the rear bench, they feel like a park bench with a little padding. The ride is pretty nice and smooth and steering is very nice on these especially when you get in to a crowded parking lot. When we got the vehicle we had to replace the cup holder (I only trust the one) and the ash tray is about to go. The factory stereo really sucked so I invested about $750 in to a much better one. I'd recommend at least a speaker change. As far as towing power I wouldn't recommend a Tahoe for anything heavy. I towed a small Bombardier 4 person boat with it once, and it struggled a little bit. The only way to make it not go in to overdrive is to run with the shifter in 3rd gear position. The engine had to rev pretty high to make it but it did. At the lake in 4 wheel low it moved the boat in and out of the water on a really steap grade easily. On the trip back with the air conditioning on the temperature did get a little high so we had it ckecked out. The radiator had to be rotted because of a 25% blockage, which wasn't too bad at $50. Other repairs I've had to have done are a new brake master cylinder at $70, an new EGR valve $40, a new alternator was advised so I replaced that (don't remember the cost). Aside from oil changes thats all I've had to do, which isn't too bad for a car with 80,000 miles on it to date, and most of the above things wern't completely broken yet so I could have done without most of them. Overall I've been quite pleased with my purchase. <br><br>
