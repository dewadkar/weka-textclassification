                 My parents are the sort of people who buy cheap ugly American cars and keep them until they stop running.  At least they were until they bought this car.

     Three years ago, just when I was leaving for college, my mother's 1985 Chevrolet Celebrity died.  Having driven an aesthetically challenged, relatively unreliable vehicle, my mother conceded that she should try out a Japanese car.  I was pining for a Honda Accord, but my mother felt slightly uncomfortable with the interior space limitations and tighter suspension.  Instead of a new Accord, my mother opted for a three-year-old Toyota Camry LE.

    I was slightly skeptical at first as I always thought of a Camry being a more &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; car, but I soon warmed up to it.  The looks of the '94 model are actually very nice, far nicer than the '97 Accord which I was hoping we would get.  The model my mother chose was champagne with the moonroof option.  I believe that car-makers should be forbidden from making champagne-colored cars, and my step-mother's '97 champagne camry is rather repulsive (in my opinion), but with the design of the '94 camry and the option of the moonroof, it actually looks quite sharp.

    I was most surprised of all when I drove it.  Besides being surprisingly comfortable, the Camry handles as well as any car of its size that I have ever driven.  Considering the fact that it only has a 2.2 liter 4-cylinder engine, it is very quick.  This car runs steadier at 80 mph than my friend's 93 Ford SHO.  I absolutely love the steering and suspension and the engine sound is quite soothing.

    My mother has beat the heck out of this car in the three years she has had it.  She has made the 200 mile drive to my college more times than I can remember, usually fully-loaded with cargo.  She has put about 55000 miles (mostly city driving) on her camry in just over three years.  She has also been in numerous fender-benders and the car was formerly a lease vehicle and was not treated ideally.  Despite all of these factors, this car performs as if it were brand new and has needed very little besides body-work and standard maintenance.

    I am 21 and I am nowhere near embarrassed to be seen in or driving this car.  I definitely recommend this generation of Toyota Camry to any used car shopper.<br><br>
