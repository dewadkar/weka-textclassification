            The price is right for this 1.3 megapixel camera.  I originally bought the MX-1200 for $150 on the web.  Not to mention that this camera has been discontinued by Fuji, so you should start to see close-out prices.  The camera shoots beautiful pictures at up to a whopping 1280x960.  For those of you that don't know, that's usually bigger than your screen will show all at once.  The picture size can also be halved to conserve storage space on the 4mb SmartMedia card that comes with it.  The camera comes with multiple adjustments and auto settings in most categories, making it great for first time buyers as well as those with a little more knowledge.  Advanced photographers may be a little disappointed with this camera because it changing the settings takes time and may cost you a quick shot if you're playing around with them, but most average users will be more than satisfied with the results of the auto settings.  The camera is also very user friendly, with a wheel type dial for changing modes.  The software that comes with the camera is also very easy to use and easy to install.  The two major drawbacks of this camera are, first, that it uses SmartMedia cards for picture storage, which are a little more costly to buy extras of than some of the other cards, and, second, that it uses four AA batteries, which the LCD display can drain in a mater of hours if you're using the display while taking pictures.  Another minor drawback to the MX-1200 is that there is virtually no zoom.  I has a 2x digital zoom, but there is no optical zoom at all.  All in all, this is a great camera for first time and intermediate users.<br><br>
