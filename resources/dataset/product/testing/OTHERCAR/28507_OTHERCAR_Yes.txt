            I now own a 1990 SAAB Tubro Cont.  This is actaully my 5th Saab.  I started with a 1979 Green Saab.  I then moved to a used 1983 Turbo, and then a 1983 900 S.  I also had a 9000 CD.  All of these cars were used, but they still have a lot of life left in them.  <br>My current car is the best so far.  It combines the best of European cars.  SAAB is not the most popular car, and I like it that way.  While all of the other cars are looking alike, the classic SAAB Body Style stands out.  <br><br>Mechanically, it runs excellent.  It does have its quirky problems, but nothing serious.  My main concern is to keep the body in shape, so I can keep this classic.  The only other SAAB I covet is an old TOAD or perhaps the Limited Edition 900 Turbo Convertables built at the end of the production run.  <br><br>Needless to say, I am not impressed with the new 9-3 and 9-5's.  I am sure that the new SAABs are good mechanically, but the body style has lost something.<br><br>I could have bought a new car for the same money, (10,000) but I would not have had the enjoyment.  I have recommended SAABs before for safety and driving enjoyment and I still do.  SAAB is an airplaine company that also makes cars.  I recommend getting ahold of 900's with good bodies so you can keep them.<br><br>My 9000 was enjoyable, but the 900 is a more solidly running tough car.  Don't be afraid of the turbos.  It is best to get a 89 or newer and make sure it is a water cooled rather than a oil cooled turbo.  You will enjoy this car with the top down,  In the winter, it heats up well and handles well in snow.  The 900's without convertable tops, are great for cargo and passengers.<br><br><br><br><br>
