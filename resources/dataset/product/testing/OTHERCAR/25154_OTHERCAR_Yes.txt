            I realize that I should probably be posting a review once I've used the camera more than a handful of times (I've only had it 24 hours) but I figured that it was more important to get at least one review on this camera out there in case you're sitting on the fence about the issue like I was.

The camera really was love at first sight. It's so small and fits right into the palm of your hand. My first excursion with it was to a concert where they obviously don't allow cameras and search your bags. This camera is so tiny I slipped it into my cell phone pouch on my bag and no one was the wiser.

I had the camera up in running in 2 hours (the battery had to charge) and the manual includes a page outlining how to take a picture right away without learning how to operate or fiddle with anything. I needed to look at the manual to get a feel for how the menu navigation worked and so after that I've been able to figure out lots without having to always refer to the book. The back of the camera has 5 buttons for playing with the image viewer.

The camera has a movie mode which I wanted but didn't think I'd really use. I did however take a movie (just a few seconds) and it really was a lot of fun and I'm sure once I get some more flash memory I'll be using it take little videos to post on my website. I think the downside is that the format is avi when I'd prefer mpeg.

The software was easy to install and I was able to transfer pictures from the camera to my computer very easily. It comes with a lot of different software titles so I'm sure it'll be a while before I try them all out. 

I'm no photo guru so I won't comment on photo quality and I haven't used the camera enough to comment on battery life. But it did come with a battery and a charger which not all cameras do.

What sold me on this camera was it's size. It's tiny and I'm sure it will go every where I do. A bigger camera would have been cheaper but I probably would always forget to bring it along when with this one it just slips into your pocket. 

I also considered the Canon A-20 (but it doesn't come with batteries! And it's significantly larger) and the S300 (the S110 was already more then I wanted to pay).
