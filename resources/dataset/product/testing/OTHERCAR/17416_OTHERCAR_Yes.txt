            My parents bought thier 1998 Toyota 4-runner in early 2000. We previousy owned a 1996 Toyota Tacoma and were planning a trip to Tahoe. My sister and I were getting a bit to tall to be sitting in the tiny backseat of that truck, especially for such a long trip. So my dad and I went to the dealership and feel in love with the 4-runner. 
I was just learing how to drive at the time, and I learned using the Toyota.
The Toyota 4-runner has a lot of power for an SUV and off the line it's as quick as some of the sportier cars on the market.
It doesn't take corners too well, but it has remarkable traction and handling when it comes to driving in the snow. 
The stock stereo sounds great, both in the front and the rear of the car. Its great for towing, and the back seat fold down to give you quite a bit of hauling space. Even without folding the seats down there is plenty of room. 
The car itself is room and great for a family of four.
We didn't have any problems with the car until recently when the transmission started slipping, but I think thats more from the car taking abuse from my sister and I than it is from normal wear and tear.
The only complaint I have is that I am a short person and the seat doesn't quite move enough for complete driving comfort.
The Toyota 4-runner is definetley a tough car, and would recomend it for anyone who wants a family car, but not a station wagon, and is looking for something a little meaner than a minivan. It is also a must have for those adventerous mountain type people.
