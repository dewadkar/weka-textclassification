            i bought this truck because i wanted a 4x4 but not a full size one
this truck is the perfect one for a small family that owns a house
where everyone needs a pickup truck for dump runs, camping,christmas tree's,furniture, moving/picking up stuff and lastly-towing.
it is easy to park and my 5'2&quot; wife loves to drive it. i got the v-8
slt version,LOTS of power when you need it!and it's american made.
the tranny went out at 25,000 miles but it was under warranty 
i was told that once the tranny is rebuilt it will last a lifetime
i get 18-19 miles to the gallon also. the seats are so comfortable, i have back problems and this truck is like sitting in a lazy boy lounger.
drive it , you'll like it.
