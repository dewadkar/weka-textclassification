            We purchased our SL2 in 1996. We considered a Mazda Protege, which four years down the line is what we are replacing it with. We're basically hoping to get out while the Saturn still has some value and before repairs begin to escalate. The car's not a complete heap, but it's clearly not even close to the same league as similar models from Toyota, Mazda, or Honda.

At 66k, the door seals and brakes need work, both already done once under warranty. In fact, the door seals in the rear doors are so loose that the back seat is actually noisier than my Tracker Convertible. We've had the speedometer replaced a few times due to &quot;clicking&quot; of the odometer--we stopped when the warranty ran out. All these are known Saturn defects that you can look up on usenet. We had to replace an alternator as well. 

What really bothers us tho is the rapidly decreasing gas mileage (low 20s, when we bought it usually over 30 for the same drive), decreasing performance, and the fact that the car requires several minutes of cranking to start after being left longer than a weekend without running. Forget our 10 day vacation: almost wore the battery down and after it coughed to life, it set off every emissions sensor on the dash.

This car isn't down there with clunkers like the Neon, Escort, or Cavalier, but it's not exactly a quality product either. You can do far far better, no matter how warm and fuzzy the Saturn dealership makes you feel.<br><br>
