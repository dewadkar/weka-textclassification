            I have owned the quest for almost one year, and it is a dependable car. Its a nice size with room for storage, and yet it handles like a compact car. It is also very good in the snow and the controls and such are convenient and well laid out. It is however, very noisy whenever you are straining such as on a hill etc. The front exhaust starts to sound like a poor race car. It is also not that great on gas for a small 6 cylinder car. I own a Ford aerostar that is much bigger, and gets better mileage. The ride is smooth, but a bit stiff. The tv console is nice for the children, and is probably one of its biggest selling points.
We had an o2 sensor go on the quest, and it took over two weeks to get the part. We were told not to drive during this period. They wouldnt lend us a vehicle. I called Nissan, and they told me they would have an answer in 5 business days, leaving us without a vehicle for another week. Their attitude was also very poor. This was a vehicle with only 9000 miles on it, and it was unable to be driven for weeks. On the whole however, I would still recommend the Quest to someone looking for that type of vehicle, a small van. I wouldnt be surprised however to find that the Honda or other small vans would be a better investment.
