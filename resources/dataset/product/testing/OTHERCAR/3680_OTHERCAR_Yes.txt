            	Driving home from college on a Civic, you would think it would take a long time, that its commuter appeal would make it slow and boring, ineffective at passing trucks, or simply put: feel too <i>plain</i>.

	Driving on the freeway on a 2001 Civic, however, is nothing but exciting! (read below for details)

While the new style and performance cannot leave a Porsche in the dust, Honda was able to re-create another wonderful car; and this time, it <b>feels</b> nothing like the plain, old, commuter.

A few weeks ago, I was able to drive the new 2001 Civic LX. I dropped off my mom�s Audi A6 at the dealership for its 24K service and they gave me a brand new Civic LX, with 12,000 miles, as a loan car. Talk about service...

I drove the car the entire day, so as not to wear down my �poor� Jetta. And let me tell you, based on prior ownership of a 1997 Civic DX, the new Civic is much better.

	<b>Performance</b>

The 2001 Civic LX offers only 127 hp (115 hp on other versions), however Honda made modifications to the engine that become known immediately: there is more power on the wheels (torque) and the car moves faster than ever before. Reaching highway speeds compared to the �97 model was very easy.

The 1.7-liter (one tenth higher than before) VTEC-E engine provides the extra push needed to make passes faster and with less worries.

My car came with the automatic transmission, which worked well but made shifting way too obvious. I could feel every shift, as the entire car moved back a bit, in reaction to each change. My �99 Jetta only reacts this way when I shift from reverse to drive -- and vice-versa.

Moreover, while the red line only starts at about 6,400 rpm, the transmission shifted before the car even reached 3,600 rpm; which I thought was odd. Maximum horsepower comes at 6,700 rpm, while torque peaks at 4,800 rpm.

	<b>Comfort</b>

Comfort, in my view, took a step down on this model. Finish in the interior was only satisfactory. The materials used on the dashboard felt cheap to the touch, and the position of important instruments was awful! While changing the position of the side mirrors, I had to stretch under and behind the left portion of the steering wheel. How am I supposed to adjust the mirrors if I have to move to reach the buttons? Each time I wanted to adjust the mirror, I had to move to reach the switch, move back into driving position, reach the switch, and so on. Imagine going through this process each time after a spouse or friend took the car out! I much rather prefer the mirror control on the door (like in the Jetta) or center console (like the A6).

On the other hand, if interior room is important for you this car felt very spacious (I�m 5�8). The dashboard extends a long way to the windshield, and controls are spread out (maybe too much...) -- providing a large interior feeling. I have to admit, though, that I was alone in the car the whole time!

The trunk is also large (12.9 cubic feet), but the arms of the door interfere with positioning of luggage (my Jetta doesn�t have that problem, hehe).

Unfortunately, I cannot write about the quality of the stereo. The radio & CD-player (one unit) was blocked off with a code, and I did not know it. I assume Honda made no modifications since �97 and, if that is the case, quality of the <b>four</b> speakers are only �good� -- and high bass lovers would require an immediate upgrade.

The Civic I drove also had a power moonroof! It provided a good view and its one-touch feature worked very well.

Another downturn in comfort on this model was the significant amount of wind and engine noise. Any time the engine reached 3,500 rpm, it would scream like my dad�s 4Runner does at 5,000 rpm (with a 3.4-liter V6)! I thought this was very poor design -- and someone at Honda agreed with me -- because the 2002 model comes with new noise-reduction technology (as per MS CarPoint�s web site).
 
	<b>Safety</b>

Honda has recently added side airbags as an option on all Civic models. I think this is a step forward, though I think it should be standard (like the entire VW line). ABS brakes are standard on the LX model, but only optional on others.

Once, I had to make an emergency brake while driving the �97 Civic (no ABS here), and the car skid and made a lot of noise, and barely slowed down at all. Based on my experience with ABS on the 4Runner, Passat and Jetta, I <b>highly</b> recommend you get a car with this safety device. It helps in virtually every situation: from making a tight turn on dirt, straitening out the car when hydroplaning (scary stuff), or most obvious of all: slowing down <b>fast</b>!

Only accident I ever heard of happening due to the ABS was when the system failed to activate in one wheel and sent the car spinning (on an Integra).

	<b>Conclusion</b>

If you are searching for a new commuter and wondering whether the Civic is worth fifteen thousand of your money (US dollars), I think this could be your next car. However, I recommend you check out the VW Golf first. The Golf is not as reliable as any Honda sedan (based on my experience with the Jetta), but it has better handling, excellent sound system (eight speakers), ABS brakes, front and side air bags, and comes well equipped at sixteen thousand. The Golf also shows off with a turbo-diesel engine that does up to <b>48 mpg</b> (90 hp).

One more thing: the ride on the 2001 Civic LX is very nice. I drove down a 270-degree on-ramp (posted 25 mph) at 30-35 mph and only one tire made any noise. The car remained true to the direction I put it on, remained mostly level on turns (without leaning too much), and absorbed most road bumps with ease.

My only serious complaints are wind/engine noise and the cheap interior!
