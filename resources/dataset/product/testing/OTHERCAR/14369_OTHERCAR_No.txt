            I bought a brand new Altima 2001 two weeks ago (with only 10 miles on it).  It has the so called security key, key with computer chips.   On Tuesday Jan. 23 evening, it would not start and it took me 30 minutes to coax it to start by luck.  On Saturday night and today, I tried dozens of times.  It just would not start.  The dealer said their service shop won't open until Monday morning. They can take a look on Monday and go from there.  

I suspect it is the security key that is not working properly.  Anyone with similar experience?    

What is the best route for me to take to prevent such headache from happening? What kind of help/support I can expect from the dealer?  May I get your suggestions, advice, comment? Thank you.
