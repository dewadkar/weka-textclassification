            This is the first digital camera I have owned and it is a great experience.  The design is sleek and comfortable, it takes great pictures with high enough resolution to be worth printing, and it has several different menu commands that are very useful.  My wife and I use the camera to take pictures of our baby as he explores his new world, and it is extremely handy for this purpose.  We leave it on the desk next to the computer with the batteries in the charger.  When my son discovers something new, chases the dog around, walks after our dog, or gets covered in baby food, I can whip out the camera in seconds, take as many pictures as I want, deleting bad ones as I go (if I can bring myself to do so...), and then once we are done, send copies to his aunt, his grandparents, and all the other interested  relatives.  People never bug us to send pictures or call to talk about his accomplishments--they can see them second-hand!  The camera is also very durable.  Our son loves picking it up and dropping the camera if we put it down for a second within his reach.  With all the abuse it has taken, we have had no problems with it mechanically, and it does not even have a scratch!  I am impressed by the high quality of the pictures as well.  We now put the pictures on our screen saver which allows us too see every day the tremendous amount he has changed in just the few months we have owned the camera.  We bought the camera because we had a low budget, but wanted something that would take high quality pictures, and that is exactly what we got.  Kodak supposedly has some of the best lenses available in their digital cameras, and this camera is no exception.  The flash is very handy as well, lighting up even the dimmest room bright as day--handy for taking pictures of our son when he is asleep.  Also, the LCD display is great not only for previewing pictures (a feature that is absolutely indispensible), but also for use as a substitute for the viewfinder, which often is not quite accurate in predicting the exact size of the picture.  The problem with using the LCD display is first, that is uses up battery power like there is no tomorrow, which is annoying when my son splatters food all over his mother and the camera will not take a picture of it, and second, that in the dark or at a slight angle it is very difficult to see clearly.  The only other problem is the 8 mb card that comes with the camera is way too small, and especially using the highest resolution, is filled way too quickly.  The simple way to fix this is to buy a larger card, but we do not have much money, so that will have to wait a while.  All in all, it is a great camera, and it has revolutionized our lives.  I heartily recommend it to everybody.
