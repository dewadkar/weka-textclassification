              I am a loyal Toyota fan and think this is definitely the best Toyota I have owned...This car is almost perfect and the price is very reasonable if you are very cautious while picking options.  I get well over 500 miles on a tank of gas and get reasonable performance from the 4cyl/ 5 speed combination. 
  The ride is quiet and the handling is so so. The body exhibits more side to side motions than I am used to in a supposedly "sporty car." The steering is accurate once you get used to the strange motions you feel when turning the vehicle. If you want better handling without too much expense lose the original equipment tires. I changed mine to Goodyears and noticed an improvement immediately. They are no where near as quiet as the Bridgestones but they don't squeal as much when entering access ramps to the freeways and offer a more secure feeling to the overall driving experience.
  Overall the fit and finish is superior. Not a rattle anywhere. The paint is beautiful with the exception of the numerous paint chips from driving on the expressways around Atlanta. People never guess the correct amount when they ask what I paid for this vehicle. They always guess thousands more. When I tell them that I got this car for under 18k with the alloy wheels, power seats and rear spoiler, I always get the "Yeah right" response.
  The Daytime running lights will not go off while the vehicle is on. I think the operator of the vehicle should be able to turn the lights off when the car is not in motion.
  You don't see as many of these as you do the Accord coupe which was one of my main reasons for purchasing this vehicle. The other was that the Honda Dealers did not seem interested in selling the lower priced models in the Atlanta area. I will say that the not as popular reason has gone down the tubes, because in my apartment complex there are at least 12 Solaras now and I am starting to see more Solaras on the road lately.
  Test drive this car if comfort, superior quality materials, fit and finish are important to you, you won't go wrong. If handling and a sporty ride is more important to you, try the upgraded sports model or see the Toyota dealer for the TRD upgrade.
