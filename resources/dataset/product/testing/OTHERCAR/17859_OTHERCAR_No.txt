            (This is my Mother's vehicle which I have driven far distances on many occassions)
Our 2000 Chevrolet Blazer LS 4 door we thought was a smart investment.  It's a roomy SUV with a comfortable and quiet ride.  The seating is comfortable in general but I can see where the rear seat is really only comfortable for smaller people due to lack of toe space underneath the back of the front seats, and the door opening being smaller the lower it gets.  Occasionally, people have tripped or gotten their foot caught because the bottom of the rear door is so narrow.

Yes, this thing does have a comfortable and quiet ride but, when you go to back this thing up, you are lible to think you're driving a Tahoe or an Expedition beacuse this thing is bulking and slow going around turns in reverse.  The rear headrests also provide some obstruction of the view.  I've driven other mid-size SUV's that have been easier to back up than this one.

Tight spaces are another issue for this truck.  Because of it being bulking around tight turns, getting it into my garage has been a choor at times.  Yes, my garage is small and I have to go around a sharp turn in the driveway just before entering it.  So, I have to do a little adjusting and manauvering sometimes before I can get it into the garage.  I actually put some fault on the design of our driveway and garage more than the car however, but tight parking spaces can be a chore too, and you really have to watch it.

I also might as well warn you to use caution going around sharp turns and not to go too quickly because, when turning, you can really feel the weight working against you and this thing could roll over on account of the fact of it being tall and not very wide.

The interior provides many useful features.  The Overhead Consel, included in the content package 1SC on the LS versino, is a wise pick.  It includes 4 map lights (2 front, 2 rear), bin and button for the garage door opener, a case for sunglasses, and an extra storage bin for anything you want to put in there, that will fit and won't come tumbling down when you open it.  The center consel between the bucket seats provides generious storage area.  The rear liftgate is also a wise option over the standard drop down truck gate with the lift up glass.  The lift gate provides easier access to the rear cargo area so you don't have to lean over the drop down gate with the lift up glass.  But, the lift gate also has seperate lift up glass, so don't worry about loosing that if you would be using that.  Also, Remote Keyless Entry is a wise option so you can just hit unlock and get in quickly during a downpoor and so you don't scratch the paint around your doorhandle trying to get in at night.

Now on to the mechanical problems!  We had an transmission leak, a tiny leak.  A tiny leak turned into a big leak.    So, we took it in to be fixed and supposedly it got fixed.  A few days later, the whole rear window fogged up with an oily substance and it had to go back in to have the whole transmission torn apart and fixed.  We got it back again and it snowed.  What luck.  Were coming home, it's snowing, and the 4 wheel drive doesn't work.  So, we had to have the 4 wheel drive fixed.  Hopefully we've seen the end of our problems.  

All in all, this truck has been good and pratical for a family of four and it's always a pleasure and very comfortable to travel in.  It was also a great buy over the other SUV's we had considered. (Those being Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner).  However, it's not something I would recommend.

UPDATE:  As of right now, this vehicle has 60,000 miles on it from getting driven almost 100 miles everyday and taken on vacations.  So far, no more problems since the transmission/4 wheel drive incident.
