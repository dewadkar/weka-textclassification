            Model Year 2001 Nissan Sentra All new and redesigned for 2000 the 2001 model is the same body wise in all respects.  One feature was removed the rear trunk net on the GXE Convenience Package.  You can still get the rear trunk net you'll just have to pay more for it.  

Besides that slight package adjustment the 2001 Nissan Sentra remains the same as the superb 2000 model.

I must say Nissan surprised me.  In August of 2000 our beloved &#145Emmy&#146, which was our 1999 Toyota Corolla, was totaled on LBJ Lyndon Baines Johnson Loop around the Dallas Metro Area.  Upon the demise of our year old car obviously the Toyota Corolla was the front-runner for our Insurance money dollar.  However, Nissan surprised my wife and I with a great redesigned Sentra.  The 1999 Sentra's that we looked at in late 1999 were note even close to the caliber nor quality of the Corollas, Civics etc we were looking at in our view. 

But the redesigned Sentra did well improving on all aspects of the cars design and subtly ousting the Corolla to our 2nd choice.  

Let me explain why.  The car handles subtly like a car in the midsize class.  A hefty body and strong suspension give a larger car feel while driving.  In fact while driving our 1999 Corolla gusts and even grooves in the road way could wobble our Corolla from side to side with ease.  However, this is not the case with the 2001 Sentra.  The same grooved pavement is hardly noticed as we cruise by.  Given smooth roads and non-windy roads, the ride of the Sentra and the 2000 Corolla are close in several respects.  First both have about a 125 horsepower engine.  In fact I think they are within 5-horse power of each other the Corolla at about 125hp and the Sentra at 129hp in the baseline models.  A larger 145HP engine is available in the Sentra SE edition.  The 129 HP engine is plenty strong enough for my wife and I.  While the Sentra won't set any land speed acceleration records it has enough get up and go to get you safely into the flow of traffic at Highway Speeds and easily out of harms way in a tight spot.  


The acceleration in our Sentra is a little improved, as is Gas/Economy by our choice of the Manual Transmission.  I believe gas economy is rated 28 to 30 City and 34 to 36 Highway.  The thing that impressed me more were the engineering changes in the Sentra, putting back on the old Steel Chained timing belt and obvious noise reduction technology made my wife and I look at each other with questioning stares as the other was driving and say &quot;Did you kill it?&quot; since there was so little engine noise at idle that we mistakenly believed the Sentra had died on us! 

However no matter how much I was impressed with the quality engineering changes to cause the noise reduction and the smooth larger car handling, my wife was impressed by the cosmetic changes that resulted in the feeling we were in an upper class car.  The improved styling around the gearshift is especially noticeable in the Automatic transmission (reminiscent of the Maxima) and the handy sunglasses holder next to the large reading lights above the mirror.  I hadn't realized how much I had missed reading lights until we bought the Sentra!  (The 1999 Corolla CE did not have reading lights)  In addition the extra storage space above the stereo on the dash makes for a great place to store all that stuff that doesn't fit into your console!

In addition to these inside refinements the dual power outlets for cell phones under the stereo and next to the emergency break provide plenty of power plugs for our 3 Cellular phones!

Another thing about the vehicle is the way the seats hold the passenger in.  Along with the sleek styled side door armrest the Sentra almost makes you feel like you are in your own personal private cockpit! 

For those audiophiles out there you&#146ll be glad to know the GXE model comes standard with a 7 speaker CD system!  And the sound is excellent for this smaller sedan!

With all these glowing positives, you had to know a negative or two was coming.  Well here it is, actually just one negative, that&#146s all we&#146ve found so far!  The windshield wipers are inadequate, often leaving streaking during rainy weather even when the windshield is clean.

Overall the Maxima Oops I meant Sentra, is a top class sedan in the compact class.  The styling and performance along with the little extras make it a top choice in its class.

Updated: 
Overall I would rate the Sentra an 7 out of 10

Styling a 7 Great curves on this Sedan very reminiscent of the Maxima!
Handling a 9  Feels like a mid size all the way through!
Performance a 7 the 129 HP engine is plenty for most people
Interior a 7 Upscale class and attention to detail make this a great compact interior design.  The interior has shown the wear of its age and has slightly detracted from its initial glow!
Updated:
Comfort and Reliability (so far) an 7 Comfortable hugging seats along with the indented arm rest in the door make the ride endurable for the stretch and with no trips to the shop things are okay so far!

Updated:
The Reliability of the Sentra over the past 3 years has been pretty good: We've had 2 major trip to the shop for recalls one of which left us stranded the second a little dissatisfied with an ongoing front wheel noise:
Unfortunately this isn't an entirely uncommon experience with new model vehicles from many manufacturer:
Comfort:  The long ride comfort of the Sentra is about average for a compact sedan. My 6 foot frame generally needs a stretch or two after 3 hours in the vehicle:
