            The Suzuki Vitara JX+ 4 door is an affordable, spacious vehicle.  For a year I was looking for a vehicle to purchase and only looked at sedans until I saw an ad for the Vitara at a local dealership.  I bought my '99 at the end of the year at a significant discount ($15K fully loaded) and I advise anyone buying a new car to do the same.  You will have less choice of features and colors, but it's worth it.  The Vitara seats 4 comfortably and 3 thin people in the back seat without much discomfort.  The ride is very smooth, but can be a little noisy at higher speeds (I have the model with automatic transmission).  It's also pretty fuel efficient (25 city, 28 highway I think).  My recommendation would be to purchase the manual transmission because unless you have the overdrive feature activated, the rpms get pretty high and with a manual transmission you can obviously shift gears when necessary.  The only other complaints I have are the fact that the back seats do not fold down completely flat, there are problems with acceleration when the car gets to about 55-60mph and when you are going uphill.  Other than those features, I love it.  It's the best car I've owned.<br><br>
