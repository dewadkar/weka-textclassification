            I bought my 1989 Suzuki Sidekick just before I moved from Wyoming to Texas for college.  It is about a 1300 mile trip, one way.  I needed a vehicle that got good gas mileage and was reliable.  

I was reluctant at first to buy a foreign car. I wanted a vehicle that was 4 wheel drive because I'm from Wyoming and I love the mountains there.  I needed good fuel economy, A/C(For Texas), enough room for me and my junk on the trip, and I wanted something affordable.  The Suzuki seemed the closest match.  

My 1989 Suzuki Sidekick has the following:

1)Standard 4 wheel drive with 4H, and 4L(actual locking hubs)
2)4 cyl. fuel injected engine(enough power to fulfill it's duty)
3)20-30 miles per gallon(depending on load and city or highway miles)
4)Leg room is good, will hold 4 people better than most 2-door compact cars.
5)Back seat folds up for cargo
6)Air Conditioning

I haven't had any real problems with anything on this vehicle so far.  I've used the 4-wheel drive to climb rocky trails in the mountains, driven it over 10,000 miles(packed full with junk!)and not so much as a flat tire.  It has since rolled over 100,000 miles, and it still runs great!  

The minor problems with this vehicle include: 

1)Not a lot of horsepower(it's a four cyl. not a monster-truck)
2)My brakes are squeeky(not really a manufacturers problem)

Overall, the trade-off of power for gas mileage is worth it to me.  There are not many 4-Wheel drives I have found that will get 30mpg.  The power it does have is plenty for my needs.(It can climb it's way to the top of a mountain!!)
