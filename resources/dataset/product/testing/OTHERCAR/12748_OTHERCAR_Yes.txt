            The MX2700 camera is one of the greatest digital cameras ever. It is quite easy to use and it produces great results. It has a competitive price and most of all its picture quality reach the standards of the normal SLR cameras. The cameras' greatest features are its strong flash light, its settings panel, its manual settings mode. The manual mode is great because it lets you taking photos in extreme light conditions, in diference with other digital cameras. Its resoloution is very good with 2.3 megapixels. However the real resolution is no more than 2.2 megapixels, which is more than acceptable. A very useful feature is the macro lens mode, which lets you taking photos from as close as 1 inch! The colours of this camera is another great function. It can make crystal clear stills with perfect colour distinguishing. 

The lithium (rechargable) battery saves big money from single disposable batteries. 

A big problem is the absence of RAM. RAM helps digital cameras to take photos (up to 10 aprox.) in continuous mode. This camera takes 7 sec. to save the picture. So if you wish to take photos of a moving object, you are likely to take only one photo. 

In general it is a good buy, and I would think that it covers the needs of every person even the professional photographer. It will help you to make an extensive photo collection at no cost of films and film processing. <br><br>
