            I bought a used black 1995 Honda Prelude VTEC (manual transmission)two and a half years ago and I am still loving it.  The main reason I chose this car was that I have heard rave review about this car ever since it first came out in 1992.  Since I was a poor student, I couldn't afford to buy it brand spanking new.  Then one day, my old car broke down, which forced me to go look for a new car.  I was really lucky to find a two years new, top of the line, black-on-black Honda Prelude.  It was the right price.... so I bought it.

It's sleek design, illuminating dash, and great handling makes it a fun car to drive.  Even though the new design came out at the time of my purchase, I like the 92-96 design more than the '97 design because I thought the older design looked unique and the interior was roomier.  I especially like the one of a kind illuminating dash board.  All the dash displays are digital (except for RPM and speedometer).  

The front seats are very comfortable and roomy.  However, I don't recommend seating more than 2 people because the back is quite small and uncomfortable.  It's bucket seat style makes it very uncomfortable - especially for taller people (5'5'' or above - that's not even that tall).  I usually recommend my back seat passenger to sit side ways.  The small back seat problem doesn't really bother me because I usually drive alone and I am always in the roomy driver's seat anyway!

I not saying that ALL girls don't know about the mechanics of a car, but I don't know many girls who do - myself included.  So I am just going to &quot;tell it like it is&quot;.  When I bought the car, I didn't know how to drive a stick and the prelude was certainly a challenge.  The clutch is deep and &quot;springy&quot; - as soon as you ease your left foot, it starts to bounce back, and the shift and longer compare to an Integra.  There is more movement when shifting and it's pretty sensitive.  Having said that, if you can master driving the manual transmission of this car, you can handle most manual transmission of almost any other car of similar class.  

The great handling and fun part of driving this car shows when you have to drive down a winding road.  It's center of gravity and quite low and the wheels are wide apart, which makes cornering very easy.  You won't get that sway and unstable feeling you get with traditional sedans.  I also enjoy driving on the freeway because the acceleration is great, which comes in handy when you are trying to get on the freeway or when you are changing lanes.  I can pass most cars on the freeway at will.

All in all, I think it's a fun car to drive.... maybe not as a first car for 16 years olds but it makes a great college car.  It's the most bang for the buck in terms of power if you ask me.  <br><br>
