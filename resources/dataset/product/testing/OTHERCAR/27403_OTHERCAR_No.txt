            I purchased a Neon in 95 because it was an affordable, attractive, and roomy car.  At first I was quite pleased with the car, but by the end of six months I had learned to feel otherwise.

The first problem I experienced with this car was the brakes.  They bagan making a awful squeaking noise.  When I took the car to the dealer, I was told their was nothing wrong with the brakes.  I have since had the brakes checked in many different shops and have heard the same line over and over...&quot;Neons just do that.&quot;  Apparently it's something to do with the kind of brakes they have and rust.

The next problem occurred about one year into ownership.  The cylinder block cracked and had to be replaced.  This replacement took about three weeks due to a lack of parts.

Then there was a recall due to steering disengagement.  When we asked the dealer if our car was included in this recall, he didn't even check he just asked us if we got a letter.  We hadn't gotten the letter, so he told us the car was okay.  About 3 months latter we got the letter.  We had driven around for 3 extra months in an unsafe car.

... In short I would not recommend this car to anyone and I myself never plan to buy a Chrysler, Dodge, or Plymoth product ever again in this lifetime.<br><br>
