            The S 2 Door Porsche Boxster is one of the best cars ever built. The Porsche is like a race car and can be driven by all ages. You will always be noticed when you drive past someone in your new sports car.

The Porsche has a horsepower of 250 and 6250 RPM's. The car is gas and has 6 cylinder and a 2.7 liter engine. The car weighs 2,855 pounds and has a total length of 171 inches.

The Porsche also gets very good gas MPG when in the city it gets 18 miles per gallon and on the highway it gets 26 miles per gallon. The Porsche Boxster is a very pricey at 54,000 but is well worth the money.

I did not buy this vehicle yet but my friends have told me that it really can accelerate at straight away's and it is glued to the road on turns. I have also heard from people that it never needs to be taken to the shop.

In the Porsche S 2 Door Convertible I love the manual 6-speed transmission, the 250 horsepower, Performance tires. The only thing I hate is the price.

When I drive the Porsche I feel like I'm the president because everybody looks at my new car. When I drive it's very smooth and has lots of power. 

If you have the need for speed then you have to get the new Porsche S 2 Door Convertible.
