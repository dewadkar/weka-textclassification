            I contemplated purchasing a V8 powered pickup for some time and was leaning in favor of the Ford F-150 until Toyota released their new Tundra.  Test driving the Tundra convinced me to purchase the truck (along with a lot of research on comparable domestic models).  The truck drives like a car with crisp handling and excellent acceleration.  I ended up purchasing the Tundra due to its' superb form, fit , and function (the long term standard for Toyota vehicles).  I don't say this out of loyalty to Toyota.......it is just a fact.  I would have preferred to buy American but my intent is to keep this truck until it stops running or I drop dead....whichever comes first.  The Tundra was well thought out....it appears that Toyota learned from the mistakes they made with the T100.  The V8 engine is powerful and very smooth.  It is a proven engine with an outstanding reliability record.......the same engine has been in the Land Cruiser for several years.  The push button ease of the 4x4 system make this truck a joy to drive in even the worst weather/terrain conditions.<br>The gripes I have with Toyota's Tundra are:<br><br>  -   ABS brakes should be standard equipment and not an option........are they not concerned with safety?  Also 4-wheel disc brakes would have been nice.<br>  -  The Access Cab model's rear bench seat is very uncomfortable.......I will only subject my five year old to short trips in the seat.  The problem with it is the seat back sits at 90 degrees to the bench. <br>  -  I expected better from Toyota in terms of fuel economy (although the stated fuel economy for the V8 Access Cab 4x4 is typical of trucks in its class).<br><br>Having said all that, I am extremely pleased with this truck and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and well manufactured vehicle.<br><br><br>
