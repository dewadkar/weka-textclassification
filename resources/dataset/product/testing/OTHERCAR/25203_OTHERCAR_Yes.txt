            I received my AstraCam as a gift and was able to use it right away with very little hassle.  I love it because it is so immediate and I can email details of my daily life so easily to far away family.  Recently we have found it very useful while shopping for a new home.  We use the camera to record each home we tour, then we can revisit homes at our convenience and compare them easily.  It is light and fits into my purse, totally portable.  It is so easy to use that my 12 year old and my non tech husband both use it. I love being able to take photos non stop and not worry about getting the perfect shot.  Bad one? just dump it! no processing costs to pay!  I printed out photos for my granddaughter on plain paper for her to take to first grade and was amazed at how well they turned out! It came with plenty of software but I just use the PictureIt software that came on my computer with fantastic results. I recommend this one without reservation.
