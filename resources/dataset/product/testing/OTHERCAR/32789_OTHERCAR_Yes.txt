            As a loyal owner of a C4 Corvette, I had put off investigating the new C5 corvette until a few weeks ago. My 1995 LT1 has been my best friend, a rare combination of acceleration, speed, handling, braking, looks and reliability. After test driving a new 2000 Corvette coupe, I placed an order for a Triple Red coupe, the same color scheme on my '95. It's chassis is more solid than my '95's, with similar acceleration and braking performance. Its interior is refreshing and up-to-date, and includes (as an option) a HUD (Head's Up Display- projects an image onto the windshield) showing one's choice of gauges, including speed and tachometer. The new-for-2000 forged aluminum wheels are beautiful to behold and drastically reduce unsprung weight on each axle, another benefit to overall handling and steering performance. I have had no reliability issues after two months. My boss owns a 1999 Triple Black convertible- his only reliability issues have been:
- a broken driver's side window (attributed to the high heat in Scottsdale, AZ)
- a malfunctioning passenger-side window lift switch

I highly recommend the 2000 Corvette! Its combination of beauty, performance, reliability and drivability make it a true no-brainer. I choose my 2000 over a $25000 more expensive Viper GTS!<br><br>
