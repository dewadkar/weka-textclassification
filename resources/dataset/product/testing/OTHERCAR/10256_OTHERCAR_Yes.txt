            I have had my "used" 2003 LS for about a month and I am constantly blown away by how great this car is. I was lucky enough to stumble upon a slightly used 2003 with 8000 miles on it. After thoroughly checking out it's back ground, I scored the LS V8 Sport for 28K.

I was dead set on buying a 2 year old Caddy STS. Historically, I have been a buyer of Japanese cars, mostly Acura, Honda, and Subaru, based on their reliability. Since 911, I have been wanting to buy American. On a whim, I test drove a 2002 LS and fell in love with the speed, luxury, and the rear-wheel drive performance, something I had missed for the last 20 years.

I love the V8 power, rain sensing wipers, and classy styling. Not to mention you don't see one around every corner. Power seats, 6 disk in dash stereo, heated and air conditioned seats, speed stick transmission, are all very impressive. Time will tell regarding their reliability.

The trunk is much smaller than the Caddy's, but adequate. The AdvanceTrac and Traction control features really do their job. Living in the Northeast, we get our fair share of snow...8 inches a few weeks ago. Granted I did not venture out until the plows were through, but if you let the computer do what it needs to, performance is great in the snow, even without snow tires. Remember...taxis and police cars have rear wheel drive too.

While I expect to have this car for quite a while, as of now, I would buy another in a heart-beat.
