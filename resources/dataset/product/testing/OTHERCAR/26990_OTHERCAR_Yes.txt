            If you even know me for just one day, you'd know that I love taking pictures. I have 2 other digicams (Olympus D450 and Canon S30, plus the Verizon vx6000 camera phone) and 7 or so film cameras. Having kids, I needed a camera that I will *always* have with me, regardless of the ocassion or what I'm wearing. I was very excited when the S3 became available and snapped up this camera about 8 months ago. 8,000 pictures later, I'm confident that I can give it a pretty much fair assessment.

THE ROLE: The role for this camera for me is to be always available for group and family shots, indoors or outdoors. With it's size and speed, it fits that role perfectly. It's inexpensive enough that it's almost disposable, in a sense that if I lose it I would definately miss the pictures in it more than the camera itself.

PORTABILITY: The reason I bought this camera is the convenience. As you know, It's very small. I carry it everywhere, including at home. You never know when the baby is going to do something cute! In that front the S3 is excellent. Very portable and always available.

IMAGE QUALITY: Get real. With a tiny fixed focus, fixed focal-length lens, I didn't expect the S3 to have the same image quality as the $1000 Canon 300D DSLR or even my Canon S30. However, I was pleasently surprised. The image quality, especially for what I use it for, is excellent. For family, friends group shots, it's more than just okay. 8x10 enlargements is no problem. As I found it, fix focus can acually be a benefit (speed, huge depth-of-field). Having a video mode is essential for me, but read in pro/con section about the video.

PRODUCT QUALITY: However, there are some serious quality problems witht this camera. First of all, over the length of 6 months, the lens got dirty internally, and small grey spots shows up in the same location of every picture. I could shake the camera and got the dust to move around, but I couldn't get rid of it. Then, the flash stops firing reliabily. Then, the case turns yellow in the front, where I rest my middle finger when holding the camera. Not wanting to part with it, I hesitantly sent it back to Casio. EIGHT LONG WEEKS and many phone calls later, I finally got the camera back. The dust is gone, the flash problem is fixed, and they even replaced the camera case. But the amount of time it took was no excuse - I missed the entire holiday season (Thanksgiving, Christmas) on this camera (I had others cameras to work with). So when I said that I've had it for 8 months, it's actually 6 months, plus 2 in the shop.

Pros:
- The size is great
- Image quality is excellent for a fix-lens, fix-focal-length camera
- Fast (start-up, shotting, navigating through pictures)
- Conversation piece
- The most excellent www.exilim.jp site, especially the Exilim Avenue web magazine (in Japanese language)
- Movie mode which Casio eliminated in ther Z4U and S20U models. But see cons.
- Spare battery is cheap on eBay for about seven bucks each. I have 4 spares but rarely use it because the battery life is excellent (much better than my Canon S30)
- Inexpensive

Cons:
- My camera lens got dirty internally. Until I sent it back to Casio, it had small grey spots in each picture and was very annoying.
- Over time, the camera case tarnished and turns yellow
- Repair services, if you ever needed, is SLLOOW. Took them 8 weeks to fix my camera
- No true thumbnail view of every picture (only calendar-view)
- Casio-branded cases not widely available in the US
- The video quality is quite low compare to the other digicams. The Motion JPEG artifacts is more apparent than with my Canon S30. However, once you convert it from AVI (MJPEG) to MPG (MPEG-1) with VirtualDub, the quality dramatically improves. It became VCD / NTSC quality and the JPEG artifacts actually went away. Most amazing.

Overall, it's an excellent camera that I still carry with me daily. However, I would only recommend this as being your secondary, almost-disposable, take-along camera considering its shortcomings. I'm personally looking forward to the next batchs of Canon cameras in 2004 to add another one to my collection.
