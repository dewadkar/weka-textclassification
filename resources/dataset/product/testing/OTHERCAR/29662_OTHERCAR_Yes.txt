            My girlfriend and I have just return from a one-week vacation to San Francisco to visit my girlfriend's sister in Oakland. During our stay we rented a 2000 Buick Regal LS sedan which we have taken all over the Bay Area. 

We originally intended to get a Chevrolet Impala. My girlfriend is seriously considering the purchase of an Impala and we wanted to see what it would be over the long run. Unfortunately, National Car Rental had no Impalas available, so we were faced with the choice of an Oldsmobile Intrigue, Toyota Camry, Buick Century or Buick Regal. My girlfriend left the choice up to me and I chose the Buick Regal believing that Buicks are traditionally upscale of an Olds or Toyota.

Our Regal, in LS trim, was silver-metallic with the upgraded cast aluminum wheels, gray leather interior with the ubiquitous 3.8 litre 240hp V-6 mated to a four-speed automatic with overdrive. The car was loaded with just about every option but the power moonroof. The factory stereo with CD and cassette was clear and crisp. I especially liked the redundant controls on the steering wheel spokes that allowed me to flick through stations and control the volume. The A/C was both effective and efficient with controls that were easy to locate and operate with a display for interior and exterior temperature. The trunk was roomy enough to accommodate our numerous pieces of luggage.

The car had a smooth ride and handled well in tight city traffic. The car had decent acceleration on the open freeway. Fuel economy was fantastic. The gas gauge needle barely budged after several hundred miles. This was great because regular 87-octane gas is $1.87 a gallon in Oakland whereas premium 93-octane is $1.78 in my native Philadelphia. I used about $12 worth of fuel during my stay and the car was happy with regular.

The dashboard instruments were clear and easy to read, however, I think Buick could've rationed out a few more sprigs of wood trim on the dashboard. Fake wood may be panned by many wags as &quot;tacky&quot; but the flat black surfaces made the dashboard seem a little too utilitarian. I personally don't mind fake timber if it is well executed. The only place wood trim could be found was surrounding the window and lock controls.

Some of the controls were confusing. I still hadn't mastered the light switch and the stalk that controls the turn signal, windshield wipers/washer, cruise control seemed to be mounted a bit high and at a steeped angle than other GM cars I've owned. The emergency brake is released by pressing down on it as it pops up. Weird! I was expecting either a release handle as in older Buicks I've owned or an automatic release as in my Cadillacs. The key fob with buttons to lock and unlock the doors didn't always do so. The glovebox location of the trunk release button was a bit of a retro touch. My '94 Deville has the trunk release button in a convenient location on the driver's left. You'd think this feature would've trickled down to GM's lesser cars by now. I don't know if Buick can be faulted for these things or perhaps I should've taken a better look at the owner's manual before hitting the open road. 

The car seemed roomy and comfortable, at least for myself who was the driver, but my girlfriend, who is only 5'1&quot; commented that it seemed rather small inside - not much bigger than her Mercury Tracer. It did seem that the front passenger's are was small, perhaps because of the center console. There was no complaint from the back seat passenger, my girlfriend's sister who is about 5'6&quot; so I imagine there was plenty of room in the rear compartment.

The Regal's styling is pretty bland. I found myself wishing I had chosen a sleek Olds Intrigue after seeing one next to me on the road. The Regal's styling seemed stodgy compared to the Intrigue. The front end with a proper grille and back end with full-width taillight are pleasantly Buick but Regal has fatter contours and a stubby-looking rear quarter. The Intrigue seemed sexy. To me the Regal said &quot;Dad's Car.&quot;

All and all the Regal isn't a bad car if one studies the owner's manual well. It felt solidly constructed and it has unparalleled fuel economy for a mid-size car. I prefer the Chevrolet Impala and Olds Intrigue for their more interesting styling, but the Regal would make a nice conservative choice. <br><br>
