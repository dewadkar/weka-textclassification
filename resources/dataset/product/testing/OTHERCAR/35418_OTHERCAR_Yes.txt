            Ok, so you want to get involved with the digital camera craze but you do not have hundreds of dollars to spend.  Can you do so?  Will doing so be a waste of your hard earned money?  The answer is yes, you can do so, and depending on what quality photo you are accustomed to, no, it will not be a waste of money.

I bought the Sipix Stylecam Blink II Digital Camera (You would think they could have come up with a shorter name.) as a birthday present for my fiance's niece.  She is 16 and as into trendy electronic gear as anyone could possibly be. However, being that she is 16 I hesitated to purchase something that would be expensive.  Lets face it, 16 year olds are known to not be the most responsible of people.  So, I shopped around and found a number of different inexpensive digital cameras.  I chose this one for a few reasons.  First off, the specifics:

*  8 MB of memory or the equivalent of saving 300 photos at 
   low quality and 60 at high quality
*  0.3 megapixels that captures images up to 640 x 480
*  Captures streaming images for up to 160 seconds
*  Connects to your computer via UBS port
*  Operates on one AAA battery
*  2.36 x 2.36 x .67 and just 1.5 ounces of weight
*  Small carrying case/bag available
*  Functions with the popular instant messaging programs
*  Functions as a digital camera, streaming video camera, 
   videoconferencing camera and USB camera 

WHAT I LIKE:

1.  The Blink II is a versatile camera.  You can use the camera in a number of different forms and it will provide what you are looking for.  What I mean is that you may be wary of hosting a videoconference with an inexpensive piece of equipment.  Don't be.  The Blink II will not let you down.

2.  The size.  I think we all know that small is in these days.  The smaller the cell phone, the cooler the owner. Or something like that.  I challenge you to find a smaller camera.  You can carry it in a shirt or jean pocket and not feel weighed down or restricted.  Heck, you can lose it in a purse.  AT any rate, she definitely will pass the cool test if it comes to size.

3.  Ease of use.  The Blink II is as simple to use as any digital camera I have ever purchased.  To begin with, the battery is normal- a single AAA will get you started.  The computer hook up is simple as well.  If you have a USB port you are set.  Simply connect the Blink II to the port and you are connected.  Even the general operation is a breeze.  The Blink II does not have a ton of different functions that tend to confuse those who are not the most technologically savvy.

4.  The ability to be sly.  Huh?  The Blink II is so small and easy to use that you can take it places where you might otherwise not be able to take the camera.  The Theatre, for instance.  Also, the camera does not have a flash.  Another way in which you can sly.  The drawback here is that the camera will not let you take a picture if the light is not good.

5.  The price.  You simply cannot find another digital camera for under $40.  

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:

1.  Let's face it, an inexpensive digital camera is not going to provide the same quality photos as a $500 or more model will.  The photos are not bad, but they can be a little grainy and I find that pictures taken inside tend to be not as good as those taken outside.  The downloads are slow from time to time.  

2.  The batteries are a pain.  While it is nice to deal with a "normal" battery, there are drawbacks.  For one, the AAA batteries are constantly dying.  The problem is that when they die, you lose everything you have saved.  A big problem unless you can download your photos frequently.  In addition, the batteries drain even when you are not using the camera.  I think Sipix should consider a more powerful battery if they really want sales to take off.

3.  While the Blink II performs a number of different functions, it does not do any of them well.  There are better "inexpensive" digital cameras (Though not this inexpensive).  Better webcams.  Better video conferencing cameras.  And, yes, better streaming video cameras.  Yes, the flexibility to do all of this with one piece of inexpensive metal is nice, but for a grownup (Some might argue with that point.) the quality is not good enough to justify using the Blink II.

4.  The price.  Why am I listing the price in both the positives and the negatives?  For the simple reason that prices of all digital cameras are coming down and quickly.  I would wait and spend a little more money for a much better camera.  If you are looking to stay on the inexpensive side, spend two or three times what you would on the Blink II and you will notice a huge jump in quality.  If you cannot spend that much, you are still going to get a camera that is useful.

THE BOTTOM LINE:

I would purchase the Blink II again for a few of purposes: as a gift for a young child or teen, to help me spy, as an emergency camera, and as a camera I could take to places where I do not want to take a good digital camera.

I still think the Blink II is a good gift for a kid.  Does a child really need the perfect photos that a $1000 digital camera will provide?  No.  I doubt I will ever become a spy, but if I was to make a career change I would suspect that the Blink II could come in handy.  Finally, I would use the Blink II as a back up or secondary camera.  A camera that I might take to an NFL game or something similar.  Essentially, a camera that I would take to the places where I would not consider taking an expensive camera.

The Blink II has it's uses, but you have to understand the drop off in quality that you will experience.  If you understand the ramifications of going on the cheap, by all means purchase the Blink II.  Below I will check the "recommend to friend's" box, but keep in mind that this recommendation will come with the caveats listed above.
