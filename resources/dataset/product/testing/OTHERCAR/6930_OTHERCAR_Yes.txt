            I am waiting for a red one at the local
Honda place.  I have read all I can and
test driven it too.  I have also done
as much as I can to find out about the
Toyota Prius.  Hands down, the Insight
is my choice.  It has more power (with
a smaller engine), yet gets better mileage.
And it comes in a five speed. It feels very
good on town roads and interstates.  I knew 
it would not be as peppy as a standard 
vehicle, but it held it's own. This will
not be a mainstream vehicle (only 4,000
will be made in model year 2000), but it
is a nice first step in the right direction.
Regarding the two-seater design: 90% of the
time, I only need two seats in my car anyway.
For family outings, we do have another car.
Also, the low-rolling-resistance tires can
make road-feel a little different than the
touring tires most people may be used to.
(Sorry if this seems jumbled, this is my
first epinion.)<br><br>
