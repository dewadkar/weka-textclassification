            In my opinion this is a great vehicle!:) It is very roomy and comfortable.
lots of leg room, cup holders, and lots more goodies. It has a very large gas tank so you don't have to stop and fill it up every five minutes, but when you do buy gas it does cost a lot! About 40 some bucks a tank.
I don't like parking it though. i am short so it is hard to see the back end of it.
We bought it because we needed space for our kids. We travel a lot and it is great for that. It was even comfy to sleep in. 
It is also a very safe suv. When you ride in it you can feel how heavy it is, which is very good on the icy roads in Wisconsin.
Some people that would probably not want to buy the chevrolet suburban is someone who is short, or has a very small family. People who should buy it is someone with a family that is looking for a nice, reliable, safe suv. And if you like shopping a lot, then you will love this suv! It has tons of room for all sorts of things! It seats up to eight people so you could have a party in there!:)
The Chevrolet Suburban is very cool looking also. It isn't and old lady car either:)
So if you are looking for a quality family car, then this is it:)<br><br>
