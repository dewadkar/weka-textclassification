            During a recent visit to my local Lexus dealership I came across a 2000 Lexus SC300 coupe sitting in the showroom that was recently traded in.  Some old woman with too much money only put 834 miles on the car during the year she had it, so it was practically brand new, even though it was classified as a used car.  I was very interested in this car since I could probably get a great deal since the previous owner took the depriciation hit.  I came to the following conclusions after driving it.

EXTERIOR
While the SC is a very nice looking car, the design was based on the original platform of its 1993 conception.  For 2001, Lexus replaced the SC with an all-new convertible design.  But while saying that, I still found the 2000 SC to be an attractive, classy car.  It certainly isn't agressively designed in the mold of most sports coupes, but it wasn't designed with that purpose.  The model I drove was red with the great looking gold trim pakcage.  The car also came standard with 17 inch wheels which really beefed up the look of the car.  While your opinions the exterior design of the SC may vary, it is an good-looking car in my opinion.

INTERIOR
As usual, the interior of the SC is built with traditional Lexus quality.  Fit and finish are perfect and all materials are top notch.  My SC came with beige leather seats which where as comfortable as any piece of furniture in my living room.  Interior space is abundant all around in the front two seats.  However, rear seat room is just average, but that is expected for a 2-door coupe.  A cool feature on the SC is the tilt and telescoping steering wheel.  You can set the wheel at a certain position and it automatically tilts when you shut the car off.  Then when you turn on the ignition, the wheel will return to your preset position.  The audio system was very good, I believe it was equiped with the optional Nackamichi system which is custom made for Lexus.  

ENGINE/RIDE
The SC300 was comes standard with a 3.0 inline 6 cylinder engine.  The engine is rated at 225hp and sends power to the rear wheels.  While not as powerfull as the SC400 4.0V8 engine, I found the 3.0 inline 6 to be adequate enough for most driving situations.  Accerlation is brisk and power comes on smoothly.  However, gas mileage is only average at 17/23 and the 4.0V8 acheives the same gas mileage figures while delivering 290hp.  So I would recommend going with the V8 since you are getting 65 extra horsepower without paying the usual gas mileage penalty.  The SC rode in typical Lexus smooth fashion.  All the bumps of the road where soaked up and the only sound that could be heard in the interior was the growl of engine during heavy acceleration.  The SC300 is not the car to get if you want sports car handling and road feeling.  If that is what you want in a vehicle, I would look into BMW instead of Lexus.  The Lexus will however give you a buttery smooth ride that is unmatched by any auto manufacture on the market today.  

PRICE/VALUE
As I said earlier, the SC300 I drove was a used model with less than 1000 miles on it, so the asking price was quite different than I brand-new model.  The dealer was asking $38,000 for this SC which is a good 4-5 thousand less than a brand-new model.  While this price may seem steep for some, remember that you are getting a top-quality car and in my opinion it is well worth the money.  For those who are not familiar with Lexus/Toyota, they make some of the best-built, long lasting vehicles on the road today.  I've owned many of their products and can say that I've never had any mechanicals failures other than basic wear and tear over the years.  Its not unsual for Lexus vehicles to run for over 200,000 miles, so make sure you consider these factors when considering Lexus.  In the end I decided not to buy the SC because I wanted a 4 door sports sedan, so as of now I am seriously considering the Lexus GS430.  I hope this review will help those of you in the market for a luxurious coupe.  If so, you can't do much better than the Lexus SC series.
