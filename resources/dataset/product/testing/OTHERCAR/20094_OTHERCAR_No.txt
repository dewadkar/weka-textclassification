               Our 1988 Mercury Grand Marquis started out as my grandfather's car( go figure!) and when he was no longer able to drive it, he gave it to us. It was used by may father to take into the South Bronx where he works. I was forced to drive this car on occasion and I am here to tell you about our experiences.

Powertrain: B- 
   The Grand Marquis, like so many Ford products had the venerable 5.0 liter ( it was really a 4.9, but the Ford marketing team thought 5.0 sounded better!. In the Grand Marquis, it made 150 horsepower. Too bad Grandpa didn't spring for the dual exhaust option because if he did, it would have had a full 160 horsepower!!! The four speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly and quietly. Quiet was really the key word to this car as it was quite hushed on the highway. I did not like the column mounted gear shift. I find those to be very awkward if you need to downshift into a lower gear.

Steering/Handling/Braking: D-
    Big boats are not known for their agility, and the Grand Marquis is one big boat! This car has TONS of body roll and has a hard time gripping the road. The steering is completely lifeless. There is NO FEEL AT ALL! Pretty scary to someone who had only driven an Acura Integra before driving this car for the first time. The brakes were very touchy and like many old Fords showed severe nosedive even in light brake applications. The ride was floaty and sickening.

Interior: C
   The Grand Marquis was a very roomy car in the front. The seats, while a little flat, were comfortable even on a road trip I took from Rockland County, NY to Boston. The dash was laid in in a reasonable fashion, but not much else in the way of fashion. This was an old '70s design with fragile feeling controls. The turn signal stalk felt like it would come off in your hands and the click click sound of the blinkers was the old school boingy boingy sound. The rear seat was not as roomy as you may think. This is due to the shape of the front seat's back rests which are flat instead of curved like in newer cars. The overall quality of the interior was good for the '70s but not today.

Exterior:D+ 
   The Grand Marquis made an older Volvo 240 look racy! It was a very conservative, boxy design. Many people liked it though and the overall design ran from the late '70s all the way to the 1991 model year with only minor detail changes, the biggest change coming in 1988. It was not a bad looking car, but its not a style I prefer. The new Grand Marquis is a nice looking car.

Overall: D 
   To be honest, it could have been a worse car ( read my review of the Ford Taurus!). It served us well until the transmission started to go, at about 65,000 miles! It also had some exhaust problems and the body panels were rust prone. My dad sold the car in April of 1997. The Grand Marquis had its good points and its faults. I personally hated driving it and given its reliability problems at only 65,000 miles, I can't and won't recommend it either.<br><br>
