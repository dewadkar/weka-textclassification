            I bought my 1991 Toyota Corolla in 1999 and used it for two years. Even though it had 117k miles on it when I first purchased it, the engine sounded sweet, it had no mechanical problems in the transmission or anything else and the only thing that needed to be replaced was the battery.

I drove the car from New Jersey to Boston every other weekend and it was smooth sailing all the way. I had no problem keeping up the speed for the whole 3.5hr journey (once I think I made it in a little less than 3hrs - oneway) and the ride was very comfortable.

There are many older-Corolla owners that have reported a need to change the CV joints from time-to-time (3 or 4 times in the car's lifespan) but I didn't find a need to do so ever. At one point, my axles were making a lot of noise and somewhere on the road the differentials locked-up and I had to get towed. The car's axle needed to get changed and it wasn't that expensive to repair (about $550) and the car worked beautifully again.

The only significant problem I noticed was on large bridges with crosswinds when the Corolla wasn't heavy enough to maintain its weight on the road. I did feel a little jittery if I were going above 60mph and had to slow down a bit to deal with the high winds. I believe this would happen to any car but more so to one that weighs only 2200lbs. However, due to its being so light, the 102hp seemed quite sufficient and I usually averaged about 25-28mpg on the highway.

For the 1991 Toyota Corolla, MSN-autos reports common problems with the MAP sensor, the alternator, the turn signal switch, and the air conditioner compressor clutch wire .. my Corolla had no such issues (I checked with the previous owner) and I didn't have to deal with any of these problems.

The seats and the amount of space inside was pretty comfortable. I am 5'10" and there was ample legroom up ahead. However, I do tend to push the driver's seat most of the way back while driving so the rear seat behind me would get stuffy. I usually had to make short/skinny friends (or kids) sit behind me while I drove. The trunk space is quite large for a small sedan (maybe due to its boxy shape) - even with a doughnut spare in it.

The controls upfront in the dash are pretty much like most early-90's cars. It had a well functioning air conditioner (often got too cold if I left it on too long). The dash itself was a nice blue vinyl/plastic combination and the radio buttons etc were placed ergonomically enough to be easily reachable by a person of any stature.

Overall, the car rode very well on both city roads and highways. For a car that I had during my undergrad years, this served its purpose more than well. Once I bought the car, I did not have to keep paying to get little parts repaired all the time. Had I not graduated and found a job (and could afford a newer car), I would still be driving it (probably with over 150k miles on it). The only way you could kill your Toyota would be to neglect its regular maintenance (oil changes, tire pressure checks, fluid checks, etc).
