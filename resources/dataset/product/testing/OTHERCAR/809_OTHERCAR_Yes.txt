            When I bought my 1992 Sundance in 1998 I was a bit worried at first because it was a used car, which we know had previously been in an accident (The new front end and hood could have told us that), and because I had never financed a car before.  After I got it there was about $1500 worth of work that needed to be done, specifically a new starter, new evaporator (A/C part), new cam seals, the dome light needed to be rewired from the ground up, the speedometer wiring was screwed up and the exhaust needed to have a couple parts replaced.  My Dad is a master mechanic of 28 years experience and I know quite a bit about cars myself.  A new starter isn't unusual after 6 years, nor is a new exhaust pipe and the cam seals usually fail based on how hard the car was driven before, so I can't speak to those three aspects.  However, if you get a Sundance I will forewarn you that the air conditioner will likely be toast in 2-3 years because evaporators and condensers tend to die on those things very quickly. The rest of the problems could have just been caused by things going bad like they sometimes do.

The work was done under warranty for free so I didn't pay a cent of that $1500.  My Dad and I both own Sundances.  He owns a 91 and I own a 92.  Both of them seem to be pretty good cars mechanically, at least compared to some, but now the head gasket is going bad on mine and his has been bad for over a year.  This is supposedly a common problem to Sundances.  One more problem with mine, was that the hood flew up at 70 mph on the freeway, but this was likely due to the fact that the hood had been replaced after the aforementioned accident and the people that replaced it did some bad work and forgot to tighten a few bolts completely.

Ok, so it needs some work.  Really though, the car runs great with the exception that it needs a bit of work.  For a $5000 car I've seen worse.  Much worse!  It's easy to work on, so if you're a fix it yourself kind of person you can easily get around the engine, the body, if well taken care of will.  It's a great first car because it's easy to get used to driving and you're not out a fortune if you wreck it.  It could even be a good, long lasting car if you take good care of it, but maintenance is the key.  If you start missing oil changes 2 or 3 times over, and neglect to check your fluids or your belts and hoses, no car will last.  The Sundance is no exception to this rule.  Overall it's a really good car if you're looking for something economical and that looks nice.<br><br>
