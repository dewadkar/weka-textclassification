            To look at this camera, it's very aesthetic pleasing.  It has a mostly metallic finish, very sleek looking.  My ex had this particular camera.  I wouldn't recommend it.  It's quite overpriced, particular when you compare digital quality and memory size with similar cameras from other companies.  
The LCD display, like the entire camera, is quite impressive looking, you get a pretty accurate idea of what your pictures are going to look like.  However, the pictures themselves don't look all that great.  The resolution this particular model has to offer is below-par.  The pictures I took with this camera were usually a bit blurry, or looked like I caught somebody running away.  This camera will let you make a mini &quot;movie&quot; with several pictures in rapid succession, and that's a pretty nice feature.  
If the price really comes down on this camera, it might make a decent first digital camera.  But with low picture quality and such a high price, this camera isn't really suitable for many people.  Unless you fall into the &quot;amateur-photographer-who-likes-taking-bad-pictures-and-has-money-out-the-wazoo&quot; demographic.<br><br>
