            What I am about to tell you might seem shocking so you may need to sit down. This camera is one of the best in the world! &quot;How can I say that with all those other great cameras out there?&quot; you might be saying. Well let me explain. This digital camera combines two things that people look for, portability and performance. This camera has both. This makes it superior to a lot of the other digital cameras out there. There are plenty of cameras that are small but can not perform well and there are a good number of cameras that take excellent pictures that are not portable at all. 

The canon power shot has many great features. One of the things I like best about it is its 16 mb compact flash memory. The large memory means you are going to be able to take and store a large number of photos. The camera is comes with zoom lens and built in flash. This makes for excellent photos in any situation. 

As you already know digital cameras allow you to connect the camera to your computer and upload images. The problem with most digital cameras is they have a slow data tranfer. With the canon power shot however, it comes with a usb connection that makes for high speed data transfer. This can be very useful if you have a lot of pictures stored and want to upload all of them on your computer.

Even if your digital camera takes great pictures if you don't know how to use it you will not be able to use all of its features. This camera has large easy to use control buttons that make uploading pictures a snap. This is a very nice feature for people who do not have a lot of experence with digital cameras.

The megapixels level on this camera is huge. At 3.1 megapixels you are going to be able to take photos with amazing detail and quality like never before. When you combine this with the zoom lens you will have a total photo taking expierence. This camera comes with some very useful software, Adope photo delux, photo stich, zoom browser and so much more.

The real speciality of this camera is its small size. It is 4.1 inches long and 2.7 inches high. That is a small camera! It is so small that you could put it in your pocket if you needed to. It is nice to have such a small camera if you travel a lot and do not want to carry around a huge camera. All you have to do with this camera is put it in your pocket and go.

The price of this camera is 700 dollars. This is a good deal for what it gives you in performance. If you are a proffesional or a person who just enjoys to take pictures I recommend this camera to you. It may be small but it performs better than cameras twice its size.
