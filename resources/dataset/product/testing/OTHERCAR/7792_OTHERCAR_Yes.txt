            My best friend just got himself a brand new toy � Acura 3.2 TL Type-S.  Excited with his purchase, his wife and him invited us to come along for a weekend gateway to Pocono (130 miles drive each way) in their new car.  Early in the morning they picked us up, and to my surprise I was offered to drive.  Was I excited!  
Well�the first 20 minutes of the drive exposed all the pros and cons of this car:
<b><I>PROS:</b></I>  
<I>Navigation System</I>- is a state of the art, and has every possible option.  Once you enter the start and destination, and press calculate root, you don�t have to look at it ever again.  It tells you the directions in a very pleasant and clear voice, warning you of the approaching turns and exits well in advance, so that you have plenty of time to change lanes.
<I>Speed/Acceleration</I>- the car has exceeded my expectations in this 0-60 category.  It responds to the accelerator pedal so fast, you can actually think it reads your mind.  I admit, I was speeding (a little), but it is hard not to do when you have all this power.
<I>Handling</I> - the car has very little lean when it enters a turn.  I would say the handling of TL is somewhat similar to the one of BMW 5 series (which, I think, is close to perfect for sedans)
<I>Instrument Panel and Controls</I> - All are very clear and easy to reach, so once you get familiar with the controls, you do not have to take you eyes off the road to adjust climate control, etc.  
<I>Seats</I> - Easily adjustable, comfortable seating position. 

<b><I>CONS:</b></I>  
<I>Exterior Styling</I> Of course it is a matter of opinion, but I was not impressed with the way the car looks.  It has a somewhat incomplete finish, even with all the spoilers and ground effects.  The back of the TL looks a bit cheap and clumsy.  The body design is missing fine details you expect to find in a luxury sedan.
<I>Interior Room</I> - The front legroom is sufficient even for a tall driver, while the rear seat legroom is limited. You would expect more legroom from the car of TL size.
<I>Ride</I> is I would say the biggest con of this car.  It is firm, but if you hit a pothole, the whole car �dives� into the hole.  I understand the makers of Acura were trying to come up with a �Sport� suspension, but they forgot they were designing a sedan. 

I cannot say I did not enjoy the drive in the new TL, but if it was a computer program, I would definitely expect a service pack to fix the bugs.
