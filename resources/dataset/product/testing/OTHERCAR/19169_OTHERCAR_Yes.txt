            Well, I recently bought a Passat GLX V-6 after researching several other cars in the same category.  I purchased this car in Sept 99 and have found it to be everything I expected.  My husband and I nick named it the Limo. I love my leather seats with front seat warmers which makes a BIG difference if you live in Michigan with the winter weather.  I like the size for the passenger seats in the back, the large trunk which is able to carry 3 golf bags and then some, the ease of letting the back seats down for more luggage room, and the power moonroof that you can open up for a pop up too.  The car is fast and fun to drive but it also comes with front and side airbags which are important to me.
Things I don't like about the car are the cup holders--not very useful at all.  Too small for normal size drinks.  There are alot of little gadgets to the car that I needed to look up in my manual to understand but they are all a plus to have: seat memory, the rain sensor wipers, the side mirrors that turn in automatically so you don't lose one in the car wash, etc.
I would suggest this car to people who enjoy all those little luxuries that you expect from your hard earned money.  Everything comes on this car accept I had to add on a 6 disc CD player but it was worth it!<br><br>
