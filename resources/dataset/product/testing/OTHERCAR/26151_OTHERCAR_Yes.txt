            Yes.  The title of this review is a slight exaggeration, but my point is this: The Toyota Sienna seems to cost more than its competitors such as Honda's Odyssey which offers more room, more features and added benefits.  But then again, if the Toyota name is worth paying a little more for, this is may be the perfect minivan for you.  

<b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>
I'm not the type of guy that's into minivans, but after driving and riding in the Honda Odyssey, minivans don't seem so bad after all <i>(check out my review on the Odyssey)</i>.  I've read countless reviews and heard so much about the Toyota Sienna from friends.  I just had to look into one myself. Luckily, a friend of ours recently purchased one and we're keeping a close watch on it to see if it meets up to all the hype. 

At first glance, the Sienna resembles its predecessor, the Previa.  Almost looking like an egg, it's a little different with a longer hood than the Previa, giving it more room inside.  From the outside, it looks fairly small, but when you get in, it's roomier than you think (but don't hold your breath).  The Sienna seats seven passengers (including the driver) and boasts sliding doors on both the driver and passenger side.  Three trim models are available: CE, LE, and XLE (with CE being the base model and XLE being the high-end model).

<b>IS IT INCLUDED IN THE PRICE?</b>
That's the question that came to mind when checking the sticker on the windows of all the Siennas on the lot.  Seems like the list of options goes on and on, and the MSRP of the vehicle is just the starting point.  The various options kills the price and you end up paying much more than you bargained for.  It seems that way for all Toyotas (check out my review on the Camry).  The 2001 Sienna comes with driver and passenger sliding doors as standard equipment instead of it being an option (about time they followed the trend). 

<b>THE DRIVER'S SEAT:</b>
Getting in and out of the Sienna is fairly easy.  The seat is adjustable with a lumbar support for long trips.  The headrest can be raised and tilted and the seatback reclines far back for a quick nap (not while driving, of course).  The instrument cluster is well designed and very visible at night.  The pull-lever gear shifter is located on the right-side of the steering column and easily glides into any gear.  I've noticed that in many minivans (and in some cars), the stereo is positioned fairly low on the dash.  This is the exactly the case for the Sienna.  I had trouble keeping my eye on the road while trying to adjust the radio station.   

<b>SMOOTH &amp; WELL REFINED:</b> 
The Sienna is based off the famous Camry platform.  Just stretched a little and tweaked here and there, the Sienna is basically a minivan shell on a Camry base.  Not a bad thing at all because when you drive the Sienna, you feel like you're driving a sedan, not a van.  The transmission shifts smoothly and knows exactly when to shift gears.  Highway driving (and riding) is comfortable, as bumps are absorbed nicely and the wind noise is kept to a minimum.  The driver's console is like any Toyota: simple and functional.  All controls are laid out well and everything's within easy reach.  Unlike the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager where fit and finish isn't really at the 'polished' state, one look at the Sienna and you can see that every fitted component, seal, and part is put together with razor-like precision.  Rattling can only be heard from the change in your pocket and the keys on your keychain, literally. 

<b>STANDARD FEATURES:</b>

- 3.0 liter inline 6-cylinder, 210 HP engine

<b>SAFETY:</b>
Rated as one of the safest minivans on the road today, the Sienna is sought after by many.  Features such as a low tire pressure indicator is standard on all Siennas and can be very useful as tire blow-outs can be prevented.  The saying, <i>&quot;...it doesn't matter how good of a driver you are when you're surrounded by bad drivers...&quot;</i> scares me.  If I know I'm driving a safe car, it puts my mind at ease and allows me to trust it in everyday driving conditions. 

<b>TOYOTA SERVICE:</b>
Always known for reliable, dependable cars, Toyota's customer service usually roams in the bottom of the barrel.  It's amazing what stories I've heard and read.  I'm sure some of them were either exaggerated or misleading, but I've had some experiences of my own that lead me to believe that Toyota needs to improve the way they handle their customers.  Toyota offers the usual 3 year/36K mile warranty for all their new vehicles and depending on the dealership, there's various courtesy shuttle service and complimentary coffee and refreshments while you wait for servicing.    

<b>PRACTICALITY:</b>
Minivans are just that: practical.  I don't see many people buying minivans because they want to look cool or to attract dates.  I never thought I'd be in the market for a minivan, but with a 6-month old daughter, I can see how things can change.  Our VW Passat is fine until we need to go on a trip that requires us to haul along the stroller, baby things (clothes, diapers, formula, bottles, you-name-it), and then there's our luggage, as well.  You get the point. A minivan would help us our tremendously. 

Even though the Sienna comes with two rows of removable seating, it's not as spacious as some of the other minvans on the market.  Although the seats are removable, you need to find somewhere to store it if you want to take them out.  The Honda Odyssey, for example, allows you to fold the 'magic' 3rd row seat into the rear luggage compartment so that it's completely out of the way.  In comparison, the captains chairs for the 2nd row is an option on the CE and LE Siennas, as it's standard on both the LX and EX Odyssey models. 

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
Although the Sienna is a great automobile, it's still not the top rated minivan most people may think.  Competing with such minivans as the Honda Odyssey, Ford Windstar, Mazda MPV, Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth Voyager/Caravan, and the GM line of Venture/Montana/Silhouette, the Sienna wins over most consumers with its 'Toyota' reliability and 'Camry'-style handling and ride. Since price is the issue in most cases, the Sienna may not be as appealing to families that are in the market for a minivan.<br><br>
