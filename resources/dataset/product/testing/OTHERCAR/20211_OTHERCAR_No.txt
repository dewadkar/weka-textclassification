            I Bought a Chevy Malibu '99 in March 1999 and around mid-January, 2000 I started having problems with the Breaks and I started hearing these weird sounds coming from the front of the vehicle, while driving. I took it right to the Chevy dealer where I get the car services from and they had to change the front Brake Rotors and Pads and a 'Serpentine' Belt. This is after I got regular services done on the car, in time and always got the best Gasoline (Octane level 93 and higher).

Although the dealer fixed the car for free, I was still concerned and shocked about having these problems as the car was not even a year old.  So I went to the Chevy Dealer I bought the car from and was told to contact GM directly, as they are not responsible for this.  I did contact GM via e-mail and so far have not gotten any answers.  My car is running O.K., not good, as the engine is still louder than before.

Needless to say, I would not recommend anyone to get this car.
