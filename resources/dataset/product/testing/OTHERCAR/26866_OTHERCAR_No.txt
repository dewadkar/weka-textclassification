            I have owned this vehicle for nearly two years now.  I can write a lot about it, but will try to sum up the salient points.

Price Paid: $20,000
Insurance Cost: $1,000 / yr.
Gas Mileage: 16 Mpg Town / 21 Mpg Hwy
Current Mileage: 65,000

Dislikes:
My Sable has the larger 24 Valve V6 engine, which may explain the lower gas mileage, but the window sticker did say 21 city/ 27 hwy, which I have never come close to.  The interior is typical Ford, nothing special.  The leather seats are more like vinyl, but they look nice.  The interiors integrity leaves a little to be desired, by that I mean there are rattles and a lot of road noise enters the driving cabin.  I added the multi-disc CD changer after purchase, but the stock speakers and amplifier are pitiful and don't really allow me to enjoy the true sound I am sure the vehicle is capable of.  I think my biggest issue overall is the brake rotors.  

While the braking is excellent on the car, if you do a lot of stop and go driving (i.e. rush hour), be prepared to shell out money for new brake pads AND rotors every 30,000 miles or so.  The problem is the semi-metallic brake pads and the cheap metal used on the brake rotors.  A combination that spells WARP.  The rotors quickly warp to out-of-round and the steering wheel begins to shimmy in your hand upon applying the brake.  

When Ford replaced the brake rotors under warranty for me at 30k, they used the same pads and rotors and the steering wheel shakes like crazy right now.  There is a solution - buy organic pads with no metal in them (the semi-metallic pads hold heat and cause the warping of OEM rotors made from cheap metal) and look for aftermarket rotors that cost a little more.  Testament to the cheapness of the rotors is the fact that you can by them for about $30 a piece directly from Ford.  Quality rotors should run you $50 - $60 a piece minimum.

The car easily is knocked out of alignment and the front suspension requires a lot of TLC is you want the tires to last.  The only other issue I have is with the road noise mentioned above.  It has been load from day one, which may be because of the tire type, but there is a lot of air flowing against the front doors in such a way that the noise would still be present, even with new tires.

Likes:
The engine is very solid.  It runs very strong and has a ton of get up and go off the line.  A lot of low end torque.  I have never used it to tow, but I would imagine it would do just fine.  It is noticeably sluggish when out on the highway and you attempt to "step it down" into overdrive.  There is an inherent "lag" that I haven't been able to put my finger on.  I think there is a fix, but it is vacuum related and I didn't feel like having Ford mess with it.

The anti-lock braking system is outstanding.  It is very quick to react to the driving conditions and does not overpower your manual attempts to control the car in braking situations.  The vehicle is very solid under the hood and there is plenty of access to the primary serviceable parts (i.e. Oil fill, oil filter, drain pan, air filter, PCV valve, battery, washer fluid, radiator fluid, brake fluid, transmission dipstick, oil dipstick, etc.).  If you do a lot of your own work, this one is a joy to work with.

I like the leather seating because it looks good, but it is not high quality.  The carpeting is also of medium grade and is beginning to fray in certain spots.  I like the automatic climate controls.  Perhaps my favorite part of the car is the automatic moon roof.  Although I don't use it much, it is nice to have.  I also had the rear spoiler installed because it changes the whole stance and look of the car (more sporty).

Overall:

I think the pros and cons even each other out, but the gas mileage may be the biggest downside for heavy commuters.  That and the brake rotor issue.  It is a nice, powerful family sedan than can keep your passengers safe, but don't look to do it on a budget.  This car is costly to operate and maintain, but then again it does look good.
