            While I was in the process of shopping for a digital camera, I found that it was hard to decide which feature I wanted more of--zoom, megapixels, style, durability? It was hard because when I saw a camera I liked, there usually was a feature that was also lacking. For example: 3x zoom, but only 1.2 megapixels; nice style, but no zoom... you get the idea. 

One day, while looking at cameras at the Good Guys, I saw the little Canon Powershot S10 and was immediately drawn to it by its sleek and simple design. To my surprise I found out that it also possessed many of the features I was looking for and much, much more! 

First let me talk about how great it looks! It's compact and slim in a stylish futuristic silver color. Everywhere I bring it I get compliments. 

2.1 megapixels makes the pictures extremely sharp! I like to adjust the resolution and make it smaller when I am running out of space on my memory card, but even then the pictures are still clear! 

The macro feature, which allows you to take really up close pictures without the subject becoming blurry, is great for when I want to be a little more artistic and take close ups of flowers or even photographs (beats using a scanner)!

The black and white option is also ideal for making pictures look a little more dramatic and emotional. 

Another cool feature is image stitching. Most other cameras allow you to take panoramics, but only for certain lengths. With the image stitching feature, you can take a picture, move the camera over just a bit, take a picture of the next scene (the LCD displays a guide which will help in positioning where to take the next picture), move the camera over again, take another picture and so on... the length is really up to you. Oh, I forget to mention--not only can you take horizontal panoramics, but also vertical! 

There are two different types of zoom on this camera--2x optical (the lens comes out) and 2x digital (this can be used when the optical zoom cannot zoom any further). I don't use this feature most of the time since the resolution doesn't get any better. My advice: just move up closer to your subject.

Other great features (which I won't go into as much detail since this epinion is long enough): 

- 10 second self timer
- continuous mode shooting (by holding down on the shutter, the camera will continue to shoot until it is released--great for fast moving subjects)
- you can set the print type right on your camera!
- you can create a slide show of the photos you've just taken!
- and with the video cable that's included, you'll be able to view that   slide show on TV!!
- the software that comes with the camera is really user friendly, especially the Adobe software. It allows you to clean up the picture if necessary, add cool effects, and make cards or calendars.
- fast downloading of pictures onto your computer with the USB cable, but if you don't have a USB port there's still the regular serial port cable(such as the one for your printer).

I have listed dozens of wonderful features about this camera, but I do have to give you a couple of warnings about it.

- one bad thing is that the battery does not last very long. I highly suggest purchasing the recharger kit. 
- if you ever have a technical problem, either with the camera or with the software, don't count on their customer service. One time I had a problem with the software and called their 800 number. I was put on hold for about half an hour. When I was finally able to speak with a live human being, the guy told me I had the wrong extension and transferred me to the right extension. After being on hold for about ten more minutes, I was hung up on. I called again, was on hold again, and finally just hung up. I went online to their website and emailed for help instead. I received a response (with the answer I needed) within a couple of days. 

Other than those two things, the camera is a joy to use! If you're looking for a good price, DO NOT go to the Good Guys or other electronics store. I shopped around and all the prices were the same--$599.99--no matter where I went. Instead, I went online. On Ebay there was a store that was auctioning off about half a dozen of the Powershots (price ranging from $300-$500). I couldn't wait for the bidding to be done with so I went to the store's website (bestaudiovideo.com), saw that it was a really good price, and bought one. The total for the camera, taxes, and shipping &amp; handling came out to be only $501!!! And to top it all off I received it in less than a week. 

For those who already own this camera one word of caution: never ask a stranger to take a picture for you... you might never see your precious camera again. ;)<br><br>
