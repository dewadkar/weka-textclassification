            Having logged 20,000 miles on my 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport, I now feel qualified to write a pretty accurate review of this vehicle.  Essentially unchanged for 1999, the Sport is positioned both from a price and design standpoint as a low cost, high value SUV.

The Jeep trademark is arguable the most recognized name in 4 wheel drive vehicles. The word &quot;Jeep&quot; is used almost like the word &quot;Kleenex&quot;, in the sense that many people will refer to various SUVs as a Jeep.  But make no mistake, the Jeep Cherokee is a one of a kind vehicle.

My Cherokee Sport came equipped with the usual options, which included A/C, power windows and doors locks, remote entry, am/fm cassette stereo, power side mirrors, roof rack, 4 speed auto transmission, and four wheel drive.  Safety features included driver and passenger side airbags, and shoulder belts for the two outside rear passengers.  A lap belt is provided for the middle rear passenger.  There are also child-proof switches on the 2 rear doors to keep them from being opened from the inside.  I chose to include aftermarket 15 inch aluminum wheels, but otherwise the vehicle is just how it rolled of the assembly line.

The first 10,000 miles in my Jeep were uneventful from a maintenance standpoint.  The ride was a bit rough in comparison to some of the more refined SUVs, but potential Jeep buyers will realize that with the first test drive.  I  noticed a good bit of body roll in fast turns, but nothing that made the Jeep feel unstable or unsafe.  I was getting decent fuel economy (don't ask how much, I just know it was pretty good) with the 4.0 liter straight six.  It did suck a lot of fuel at high speed, so staying below 75 mph seemed to be the most efficient.  There were no maintenance or repair issues during this period. I did manage to tear the vinyl on top of the passenger seat when removing a snow blower from the back.  I took it to the dealership and explained what happened.  They put a $300 new cover on the seat at no charge and called it a warranty problem.  I thought that was very nice of them.  High marks for my dealership.

At about 12,000 miles it was suddenly very hard to shift from park to any of the drive gears.  The gear shifter would not move without really yanking on it hard several times.  After getting it to the dealership I was told there was a problem with the switch that is activated when you step on the brake pedal to put it in gear.  Ten minutes to fix.  Zero cost to me.  

At about 15,000 miles I began having strange electrical problems.  Sometimes the Jeep would act as if the battery was dead.  It would not crank and no electrical accessories would work.  Then all of a sudden it would start without any problem.  I assumed there was a HUGE electrical problem and took it to the dealership.  Loose battery cable.  Ten minutes to fix.  No cost to me except a little embarrassment.

Now with 20,000 miles I find my Cherokee to be quite reliable.  There is some noticeable engine knock when you floor it in a high gear, but that may be the cheap fuel I use now that prices are up.  Haven't had a chance to try premium gas.  

I haven't had it off road, but I've driven it extensively in the snow here in Michigan.  The part-time 4 wheel drive system works great, although you need to be going under 50 to lock it in.  But if you're going over 50 mph in the snow you're asking for it anyway.  Since the system is part time (full time is available as an option I'm told), you don't want to drive in 4 wheel drive on dry roads.

As for driver comfort, I've taken it on a few 200 mile trips with little discomfort.  The seats are a bit firm and the vehicle rides kind of rough compared to an Explorer or a Grand Cherokee.  All the controls are in a good spot for me, and I like the easily adjustable steering wheel.  One flip of a lever raises it to the full height, which helps when climbing in and out of the driver seat.  I tested the rear seat by taking my mother in law for a ride a few times.  The rear doors are narrow and it is difficult to just jump right in.  Getting out proved difficult for her as well.  I've ridden in the back also, and it's pretty comfy once you are in. A nice touch is the inclusion of rear seat heat ducts.  These are very welcome on the cold Michigan mornings if you are a rear seat occupant.

When it comes to cargo capacity I have no complaints.  I've hauled everything from snow blowers to a folded-up ping pong table in the back with no problems.  I've strapped mattresses to the top and have hauled 14 foot pieces of trim from Home Depot to my house with the back hatch open.  There are handy D-rings secured to the floor of the cargo area for tying down your gear.

In summary, after 20,000 miles I have no real complaints about the Jeep Cherokee Sport.  I probably won't buy another one when my lease expires, but only because I will be looking for a pickup truck.  We just bought a house and there are some things that I know I won't be able to fit into the rear of the Jeep.  I can recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a nicely equipped, nicely priced SUV.<br><br>
