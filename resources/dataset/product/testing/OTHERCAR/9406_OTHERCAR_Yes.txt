            I had been considering the C230 Sport Coupe, and then the C230 Sport Sedan.  I liked the idea of getting a Mercedes for under $30K.  However, one test drive of the C240 Wagon was enough to convince me that it was the right vehicle for me.

All of the reviews I had read of the C240 were great except for the engine.  It was rated as being very under-powered.  While not as powerful as the C230K engine, it is certainly no slouch.  It has also improved with mileage.  It was a little sluggish the first 1000 miles.

I find the car to be very comfortable.  It has a great driving position.  The thing I like most is how quiet the vehicle is.  My previous car was a Lincoln LS V6.  Although the Lincoln had a very quiet and smooth engine, the amount of road noise was unacceptable.  Not so with the C240.  While the C240 has a little more engine noise on acceleration, over all it is far quieter.  

The wagon offers great versatility as compared to the sedan.  The rear seats can be folded completely flat, providing adequate cargo space.

So far, the only problems I have encountered have been during the hot summer months in Florida.  If the car sits in the sun during the afternoon, the engine seems to hesitate for a mile or so.  The car was taken to the dealer for this issue, and new firmware was loaded into the computer.  While it did lessen the problem, it did not completely resolve the issue.  Now that the weather has cooled slightly, the problem is non-existant.  Now that the car is broken in, maybe the problem will be completely gone by next summer.  The only other issue has been the outside temperature sensor was reading extremely high temperatures.  The dealer found the sensor to be out of its holder.  It was replaced and the problem is fixed.
