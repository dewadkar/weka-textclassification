                 I got my first car just a few weeks before I graduated from high school, all the way back in May of 1975.  My first car was also "new"; it was a demonstrator model (as they were called back then), and had only been driven previously by employees of that dealership.  Naive as I was at the time, and barely able to contain my desire, I took the $3,000 gift I received from my grandparents for graduating, and bought that 1975 Pontiac Ventura.  

     I had a real car now!!  Although it was advertised as an economy car, it was much bigger than the compacts of the day, the Pintos, Vegas, Bobcats, Mavericks, and VW Bugs.  It was a fairly streamlined two-door weighing almost 3,600 pounds, about what a luxury car weighs today.  And despite the <i>amazing</i> sticker price of $3,200 (including delivery and the first tank of gas), it also had real options.  Power steering.  An automatic transmission.  Tinted glass.  A radio.  (Believe it or not that wasn't standard on some cars back then.)  Whitewalls.  

     It also had a warranty, extended to cover the car for another year, despite it already having nearly 5,000 miles on it.  It also had some things which I was aware of at the time, and disregarded, or found out about later, and could not forget.  It had a straight six cylinder engine; choked with the primitive emissions controls of the time, it cranked out exactly 100 horsepower.  For a nearly two-ton car.  I soon found out the strain of running the air-conditioner and taking a steep hill were too much for it. 

     Other problems soon reared their ugly heads.  Again, the engine.  It was so underpowered that even in conservative, low-speed driving, it was working near its maximum.  That in turn meant low fuel economy; I usually averaged 13-14 miles per gallon.  That car also had what must have been the worst electrical system ever made.  Critical parts of it were completely exposed to the elements, so if it rained hard, snowed heavily, or even if the engine was doused by driving through a large puddle, the water splashing into it would stop the engine cold.  Worse, it wouldn't start until it had dried out.  Depending on the weather, it could be minutes, it could be hours.

      My Ventura had electronic ignition; the first year for smaller cars like that one.  However, as I soon found out, it did <i>not</i> extend the intervals between tune-ups as it did for larger cars.  I <i>still</i> had to get a complete tune-up every 10,000 miles, instead of the 25,000 mile interval shown in the owner's manual.  

     Detroit, in its infinite wisdom in the 70s, cut as many corners as possible to save money when making cars, and mine was no exception.  Dozens of pieces of trim, both interior and exterior, fell off my car over the first three months I had it, because they had insufficient glue to hold them, or were mounted improperly.  I also got serious <i>rust</i> on the rear fenders, roof, and hood just slightly over a year after I had bought the car.  Why?  No primer on those parts of the car.

     Rear shocks and tires also wore and failed prematurely.  Why?  A basic design flaw in the car that year put too much stress on the shocks, making them, and the tires they were supposed to protect, wear out too quickly.  Batteries weren't much for lasting in my Ventura either; again, it was the electrical system.  A six-year battery might last two years; no one was ever able to figure out why they died so quickly.  And speaking of batteries, or the electrical system in general, its cold starting ability was almost nil.  Even with a fresh battery, starting the car at 10 degrees <i>above</i> zero was dicey.  For temperatures near or below zero?  Forget it.

     It had other fun features too.  In cold snaps the parking brake would freeze so it would not release, at least until the weather warmed up.  Push it into a heated garage?  Not with the parking brake on.  It was fun to call a tow truck and pay $50 to have my car towed two blocks to a garage where it could be warmed.  Yes, I usually remembered not to set the brake in cold weather after the first experience, but sometimes I forgot.

     I owned that car for four and a half years, and I finally sold it in 1980 to get the Grandville I wrote about in another opinion.  However, even as that car passed from my hands, it had one last surprise in store for me.  The person I sold it to made a cash downpayment in good faith, then left town, never to be seen again.  I hope he and it are forever trapped in some cold, damp place, where tow trucks do not go, and batteries are dearer than gold.
