            Chrysler has outdone themselves, this car is fantastic.  When asked what the con's are I had to think a long time.  The car is comfortable and extremely roomy.  The advertised gas mileage is what to expect unless you travel alot on highways, I got around 30 highway.  The attention to detail is remarkable, everything fits well in the car.  The trunk is huge.  This car will easily fit 5 people, which is not the case of many cars that state that.  Tremendous amount of legroom for the back seat passengers.  

The stereo is nothing short of remarkable, 11 speakers make you feel the music.  All of the extras are nice, the leather is soft and beautiful quality.

I considered the low end Mercedes, Jag, Hyundai XG350,Toyota Avalon, and the Diamante.  Hands down no question about it the Concorde Limited was the right choice.  The price was nice, but the level of luxury was unmatched by the others.  I truely cannot praise this car enough.  Test Drive and you will agree.
