               I had been looking at and saving for a Viper for the last 5 years, and I finally decided to go ahead and get the car of my, and many other people's, dreams. After putting out a rather large chunk of change, I was behind the wheel of one of the greatest cars of all time. I took it out to a country road, and was in awe of the acceleration and smoothness of ride. In just about no time flat, I was over 100 mph, and still increasing. Let me tell you, if you are looking for a fast car, look no further. The car was a little noisy at high speeds, but the 450 hp V10 engine was drowned out by the extremely nice 6 speaker Alpine stereo system. 
   Other than the raw speed that can be produced by this car, the looks are unbelieveable. At every light I stopped at, there were people drooling over my car, and I just sat back and enjoyed it. The 6 speed manual transmission gives you total control, although 5th and 6th gears are not used a whole lot unless you are racing this car. I can't stop driving this car, even though I own another car. The 12-inch wide tires provide for fantastic handling, even at high speeds or in rain. The braking power is excellent, and the cornering is great. The interior is all leather, including the shifter, which really puts you in the lap of luxury. All around, this car is a masterpiece. If you are looking for a sports car to turn heads and go faster than small aircraft, this is your car. 
   Oh, and one other thing-if you do decide to buy this beast of a car, expect to give it a bath more often than yourself, because I know I have.
