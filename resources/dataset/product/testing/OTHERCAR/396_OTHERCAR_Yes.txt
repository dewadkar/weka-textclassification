            I bought the Nissan Exterra because of it's style, price and equipment. Of all the vehicles I test drove, I found this SUV to be the best value for my dollar. However, the drive of the Exterra and pep of the engine leaves alot to be deired.  The seats are very comfortable and space for hauling items like lawn mowers are good. The drive on a bumpy road is like riding in a truck.  However on smooth highway the drive is fine.  It averages about 18MPG. It is a sharp looking automobile.

If you are interested in an SUV I would recommend it for 25-50 age group.
However,you will have a great of difficulty getting the dealers to move off the list price. <br><br>
