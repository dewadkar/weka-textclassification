            The first new car I bought was a 1966 Chevrolet Nova Station Wagon. I have owned a Chevy ever since. My son, who still lives at home, leased a 2000 Malibu about 18 months ago. I had leased a 1998 Cavalier, and although it was a nice car, it was too small and not very comfortable on trips. I was impressed with his Malibu so when my lease was up I leased a 2001 Malibu LS.

The Malibu LS I leased is pretty much fully loaded with a V6, 3.1 L., 170 horsepower engine. It has a six-way power seat on the drivers side, cruise control, power windows, power locks, tilt steering wheel, keyless entry, and 4-wheel ABS brakes, aluminum wheels and a rear spoiler. Of course it has air conditioning and a cd/cassette player. The instrument cluster is very convenient and contains a tach, which I appreciate, and a temperature gauge instead of an idiot light.

The interior is very roomy for a mid-size car. There is plenty of head and leg room in both the front and back. The rear seat has a 60/40 split folding back allowing you to load over-size articles. The trunk has a lot of room. Unlike some people I really like the front wheel drive. I find it much easier to drive on snow and ice than with rear wheel drive. The lights come on and go off automatically which I had normally associated with luxury cars. The power door locks can be programed to remained unlocked or locked when you place the car in gear and unlock when you place it in park. When you turn off the ignition, the radio or cd remains playing until you open the driver's door. The dome light has a switch which allows it to remain off, on or come on when you open the door. It has both a cigarette lighter and an extra outlet to plug in your cell phone charger or other unit. The seats are cloth and are the same color as the exterior. You can get leather seats if you prefer them, which I do not. The Sound system has very nice sound. This is important to me as I like classical music.

The styling is somewhat average but I like it and I don't have to impress anyone else. The color is listed as light sanddrift, which is kind of between a tan and a gold color. It does not show dirt and is a cool color. 

It has a very comfortable ride like a much heavier car. I have only had it for a week and have not had a reason to take it out on the highway. In town it has pretty good pickup and if my son's Malibu is any example it should have plenty on the highway. With the cruise control I expect it to average 30 to 32 miles per gal. of gas. And with the gas prices going up, this could be an important factor. All-in-all I am very pleased with the Malibu LS and plan to purchase it when the lease is up. The lease price was $19412 and the buyout at the end of the lease is $6324. As I expect to drive it for 10 or 12 years, I feel I am getting my moneys worth.
