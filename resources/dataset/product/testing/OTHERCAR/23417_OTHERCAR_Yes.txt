            I purchased a 2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue June 1,2000 and have been extremely pleased with the vehicle.

Since purchasing I have put over 15,000 miles on it without so much as it skipping a beat.

All maintenance has been maintained to the 3,000 mile standards and the GM service group has been excellent.

Gas mileage hovers around 30 mpg on the highway and 26 to 27 in the city.

The ride is smooth yet responsive and the 3.5 liter engine has ample acceleration to pass at any posted speed limit.

The air conditioning system has worked flawlessly on even the hottest days.

The dash board is well appointed without being cluttered and the analog speedometer is easy to read from all angles.

One item I have noted is an interesting wind noise at highway speeds when the rear windows are in the down position. The noise seems to pulsate with the wind rushing across the back seat of the car at a rather high decibel level. Upon closing the windows the car becomes very quiet allowing normal conversation at all speeds.

The vehicle seats 5 very comfortably with ample leg room in the rear seat for passengers.

Young children, below the age of twelve are restricted to the rear seat due to the absence of a disengage switch on the passenger side air bag.

The rear view mirror map lights provide good map reading visibility while not impeding the drivers night time operations.

To summarize the car seats five very well but maintains a &quot;sporty&quot; feel to its road handling and acceleration.

Great car for those family types without giving up that need for speed and power.
