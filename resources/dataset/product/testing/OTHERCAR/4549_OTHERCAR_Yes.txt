            I know true Leicaphiles would crucify me for even comparing an electronic marvel to a Leica, but I am now convinced that film is on its way out- not an easy admission for me- I have used mechanical cameras for over 20 years (Nikon FM2n, Leica M4-P, M6), and developed my own film, prior to going digital. Although AF and auto- metering takes some getting used to, I am now addicted to this deceptively simple Olympus C-2040. I have enough control over the automation that I am free to focus entirely on composition, lighting etc, rather than fiddling with the controls while the fleeting moment slips away.

The photo quality is excellent, up to 8x10 enlargements (and even beyond for really good shots). The auto flash is fantastic, particularly the auto fill flash. It's easy to toggle between modes for macro, flash, and spot metering. The LCD panel is easy to use to navigate the myriad of settings, which I was able to figure out after about 10 minutes of playing. The battery life is fine, so long as all shooting (other than macro and panorama) is done through the VF and not the LCD (most situations in bright light make it hard to use the LCD anyway). I've got the settings custom configured to my personal creative preferences, and the camera "remembers" these settings so that I don't need to re-configure the camera each time I replace the batteries. With respect to batteries, 2 sets (8 total) of NiMH AA re-chargeables is a must, as for just about all digital cameras. A fully charged set will last for well over 100-200 shots if the LCD panel is used judiciously.

The viewfinder is good, although the parallax correction could be a tad better. I'm loving the spot metering mode since I like to shoot wide open and focus only on the main subject (which is often off-center). As well, it would be nice to have the macro function toggle automatically when the distance sensor detects a subject closer than 30 inches. However, I'm already becoming adept at switching between focusing modes with my thumb on the little button, without looking away from the viewfinder.

I purchased the filter adapter and a 43mm UV filter along with the camera since I insist on using a protective filter with every camera I use. The filter adapter extends to encompass the lens when it is in shooting position (when the camera is turned on, the lens slides out, and the zoom functions within the extended casing). The zoom does make a bit of noise, but it's much quieter than the Contax G2 which never really bothered me either. As well, the filter adapter seems to dampen the sound. The one down-side of the filter adapter is that the camera will not fit into the dedicated case unless the adapter is removed each time (too much of a hassle). I purchase the leather case designed for the D-500 and D-600 series, and it fits perfectly over the camera and filter adapter.

The USB transfer is the best I've seen. I simply use the provided cable to connect my camera to my Mac, switch the camera to playback mode, and an icon appears on my desktop. The icon can be manipulated just like any other disk- double click to open, drag files to a permanent folder to copy, then drag all files from the camera icon to the trash and empty the trash to clear the SmartMedia card. I did not require any software to do this.

The Olympus Camedia software is fantastic. The thumbnails are set up nicely to allow fast editing of shots. All vertical shots can be selected at once, and rotated appropriately all together, so that it's not necessary to go through each individually. As well, all image files can be renamed with one command (i.e. Beach1, Beach2 etc).

A 64 MB SmartMedia card is a good accessory (and perhaps 2-3 such cards for trips)- I found some Lexar cards for under $40.

The C-2040 is small, light, quiet, unassuming, unobtrusive, and high-quality. Sound like any legendary German cameras you've heard of???

I am thoroughly enjoying photography once again- I shot over 100 photos this past weekend. Many are great snapshots, and about 2 - 3 are real keepers, worthy of enlargement and framing. The freedom of digital photography is to be able to shoot with abandon and not have to pay the price for film and developing (and time to develop and print!). The quality has reached a point of excellence, at least for this camera.
