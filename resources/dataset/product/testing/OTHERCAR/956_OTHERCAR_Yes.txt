            Reading some epinions one gets the idea that many of these people don't actually own what they are writing about.  Well, I bought a new hardtop, six speed and will tell it like it is:

This machine is an amazing bargain.  Bargain?  Yes, I paid exactly five hundred over invoice- $41,900 and consider that more than fair for this car.

By the way, get the hardtop.  If you haven't really compared it to the coupe and for that matter the convertible you should.  The look is so distinctive it is fantastic, people crane their necks to see what it is and men openly stare then smile.  Mine is arrest-me-red but I think red is the best on the hardtop.  

Now, back to the bargain issue.  This car is so fast (acceleration and top end) it will startle you at times.  You can pass at will- you know, need to pass but not sure of the time and space?  Just downshift and go.  It is comfortable (I am 5'10&quot;), I drove mine from Seattle to South Carolina and loved every minute.  This car gets over thirty miles to the gallon on the highway and can haul a respectable luggage load. The attention quotient is off the scale and I do mean babes.  A stranger asked me the other day what I paid, $60,000? he said.  Geez it looks and runs like 60k.

Squawks?  Sure.  There is only one cupholder.  The A/C is too slow to super cool for my taste.  The second gear lock-out is ridiculous (but you almost never need second).  And that is it.

Oh, yes, the stereo with Bose speakers is the best sounding I have ever heard in a home or car.

These cars are not produced in great volume and so the dealer sells every one quickly and you can't hold them up dealing.  But pay the price, you will not be sorry.
