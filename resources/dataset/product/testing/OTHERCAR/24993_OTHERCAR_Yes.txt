            i love this car. its a great family car and has great gas mileage. i would recommend this car to n e one. my father gets a new one every 2-3 years. hes had three already! the only mistake chevy made with this car is the cease of production. this is quite possibly one of chevrolets best 4-door cars. this car excedes the ford taurus in look, value, style, and over all quality. the luminas also has many different options (refer to your nearest dealer). i'm tell'n everyone this is it! no questions about it! chevrolet deserves some credit for this car!<br><br>
