            I have been driving this one for 2 years now. I got one of the first few pieces and sure enough had lot of problems with it. The rattle on the cargo door drove me nuts for months before I found time to take it for repair. I have had problems with the cruise control, passenger side door and so on. This march I took the vehicle for the first long distance drive with my family from Fremont,CA to LA. On the way I stopped for gas on I-5 and when I started I realized that the gear wouldn't shift out of first. It was 2 am in the morning. I drove around for a while and luckily it shifted up once. That was scary. Next day the gear wouldn't shift up and I had to go to downtown to fix it. We lost the whole day.The service at LA downtown Benz dealership was excellent.
After all this, I still like the vehicle. The ride is smooth and vehicle is roomy. I love driving it and everybody in my family loves it too.  <br><br>
