            I purchased this digital camera with my first epinions check and couldn't be more pleased! It has most of the features I was looking for and the price was great; I only paid $217 for it. It was more than worth the money!

The picture quality is great, delivering a higher resolution than my puny 14&quot; monitor (1024 X 768)! All of the pictures I've taken (of the pets of course) have turned out sharp and crisp. In an amply lit room I find that the flash isn't even necessary, and can even overpower the shot, especially when taking a picture of something white or black. The best pictures, of course, were taken outside in the daylight without the flash.

The LCD display is great! It's so much easier to get a more candid shot without squinting into a little hole. The display also allows you to view all of the pictures taken and allows you to delete the pictures that you don't want to keep. The LCD does not seem to work very well in bright daylight; I had to use the eyehole for a few outdoor shots.

Connecting the camera to the computer and downloading the photos is a breeze. The software that comes with the camera only took a few minutes to install, and we had a bit of an IRQ shortage! The wires are easily identifiable and can't really be put into the wrong hole. Of course, it's always a good idea to read the manual. The only time-consuming part of the process was downloading the pictures - it took about 15 minutes to download 20+ pictures. 

The camera has 4 mb internal memory and can hold up to 90 pictures (at lowest resolution), but has a slot for a CompactFlash memory card. This was extremely important as I had wanted to be able to take the camera along on trips and be able to take a lot of pictures. 

As an experiment, I hooked the video cable into the Video In slot on the VCR. The LCD display was also shown in the TV screen. I popped in a tape and was able to record without the benefit of sound. I'm sure using a mic, a mixer and the Audio In plugs, a fairly good audio/video recording could be obtained!

The only gripe I have with the camera is its battery eating tendencies. It came with 4 Duracell AAs and they died within a week! I would have preferred it come with a rechargeable, but I guess cheaper AAs will have to do. Fortunately, bought in a multi-pack they're relatively inexpensive.

All in all, I really love this camera. I'm still so excited about being able to take great pictures without the developing charge and the wait. I find myself taking it with me everywhere - it's light and extremely portable. If you like taking pictures, give this camera a shot!<br><br>
