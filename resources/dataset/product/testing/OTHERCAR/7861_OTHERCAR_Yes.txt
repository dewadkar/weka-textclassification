            I bought my 330ci last summer when they first started arriving. I had tested the older 328 and my wife owned a Z-3 2.8. I couldn't believe the extra pep and overall performance that a few cc's could make. 

The 225 HP 3.0 liter engine is a real performer, and coupled with the 5 speed gear-box this car is loads of fun to drive, even in traffic. It can do a 100 in a heart-beat (not that I've been there, you understand). With the new manual gear-box you almost don't need a clutch. You can "loap" along at about 1000 rpms all day without any engine "buck" or "clunk". Sometimes, I even forget to down-shift.

I bought the 2 door coupe even though the 4 door sedan is quite sleek in design. I just like 2 door models. On a recent trip, I drove the BMW about 1500 mile from Lincoln, NE to Phoenix, AZ and it handled & performed wonderfully the entire trip.

Compared with the 1998 Boxster that I recently sold, it doesn't handle as well in the corners or at high speed, but who would expect that it would. It is certainly more comfortable!

I got the medium blue with sand leather interior - I like that color a lot.  In my opinion the car has most everything one could want: good looks, good performance, and good quality. I'm quite satisfied!

4/26/01 Update:

After owning this car for about a year, I find I have a few more comments to make. First, I have not had one single problem with the car. Not a single maintenance call to the dealer. Second, for a relatively high-performance car it gets surprising good gas mileage. Over 25 on a trip and around 21 in town. Third, the stereo is not as bad as I had originally reported. I had gotten used to the custom stereo in our previous Z-3 so this was a bit of a let-down. Now that I've had a while to come back to earth, the stereo seems to be quite good - more than acceptable. And finally, the overall integrity of the auto is excellent. No rattles, everything fits very tight, and nothing is coming off in my hand (i.e plastic parts).

I remain a very satisfied owner of the BMW 330ci. I do wish, however, that I had gotten the convertible. With so many nice days here in Tallahassee, I sure do miss that top-down feeling!
