            I bought this vehicle because I had a 1993 Buick Skylark that, aside from having to replace brake pads and rotors too often, has been a great car. I am disappointed. For the money there are several cars out there that are much better deals. This car rides smooth but rolls too much when turning or going around a curve. The engine is noisy and the mileage isn't very good. It does have a good sound system. The controls are convienent and well placed. Overall I wish I had bought something else, like a Camry. I would reccomend this vehicle for middle age to older persons.<br><br>
