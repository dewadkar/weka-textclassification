            In 1998, I had to say goodbye to the old Mustang that had been my pal for over 3 years. When my parents drove by the car lot and saw my Sweetpea, they called me right away to see if I would like to go test drive it. I wanted a small, sporty car, but also one that had plenty of room to haul all of my stuff to and from school on weekends. The Sunfire was a nice looking car, much better than it's predecessor- the Sunbird. My first thought was that it looked like a miniature Firebird. On the test drive, I knew it was a steal at $12,500. By the end of the week, it was mine.

After 2 years with my car, I still love it, even with its minor faults, most of which are common in virtually every convertible. It handles great even on the terrible roads we have in Austin. I love having a narrow bodied car to maneuver our winding, narrow streets. The inside is still very roomy in the front and back, and the glove compartment can hold a six pack of Coke and then some. Since I have to drive on the most dangerous interstate in America at least twice a day, I also appreciate the dual air bags and responsive braking system. I couldn't ask for anything better. It also has an electronic tracking system that helps prevent skidding in wet conditions. This little feature has saved me and my car countless times. The stereo system rocks. My car has a factory CD player with an equalizer and great speakers that still sound as crisp as a brand new set. My favorite part is that I have steering wheel controls for the stereo, and that helps me concentrate on driving. I just use one thumb to flip through my preset stations or scan the airwaves while still holding tight to the steering wheel. The interior fabric is really durable and still looks great. You can't tell a difference between the wear on the front and back seats even though I rarely have passengers in the back. Overall, this car is just plain fun to drive, even on long trips, and the fuel economy is great. I think I'm getting about 30 mpg on highways- a little less in the city.

There are some drawbacks to the convertible model that you should be aware of. When it rains, it leaks. Plain and simple. It only does it on one side in mine, so it may not do it in every car, but you should be aware of the possibility. The back window is very small and can be a problem when you're checking your blind spot. I have learned to adjust, but it can be dangerous. It does come with a defroster and is made of glass, so it doesn't get dingy like the ones in older convertibles, so that is a plus. There are also some strange rattles when I'm driving on bumpy roads. No one else seems to hear it, but it comes from behind the driver's side door area. The shocks also seem to have worn out, but let me emphasize again that I drive on some pretty bad roads.

I would recommend this car to anyone who enjoys driving and doesn't mind having messy hair after a top-down drive.
