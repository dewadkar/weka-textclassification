            Back in the dawn of time -- before much of the Epinions community was even a gleam in Daddy's eye -- I used to drive a minivan. Yep, ten years before Chrysler-Plymouth burst on the scene with their first edition of what became the quintessential soccer-mom-mobile, I was buzzing around the countryside in a red-and-white '73 VW Microbus. And so, when Enterprise handed me the keys to a 2002 Grand Caravan SE for my rental last week, I found myself waxing nostalgic for those carefree days of yore.

For a while, that is. And then I realized that, like the commercial used to say, "You've come a long way, baby!"


<b>The More Things Change...</b>

Two memories about that VW Microbus are indelibly fixed in my mind: the heater (or lack thereof) and the safety features (or lack thereof). As a bulletproof young adult, I was perfectly content riding about country roads, city streets, and interstates alike with nothing between me and a head-on collision but a VW logo, some sheet metal, and one wimpy little bumper. In reality, though, if it had been winter I'd have never felt a thing, because my body would have been frozen solid from the knees down!

The Dodge Caravan differs greatly from that old microbus in that the engine -- a gutsy little transverse-mounted V6 -- sits up in front of the driver (providing a bit of extra cushioning in case of an accident). Then, too, there are both driver- and passenger-side airbags to cushion the impact for front-seat passengers, and a highly-touted side impact protection system. On top of it all, the water-cooled engine possesses a <i>real</i> heater, complete with vents both front and rear! And it has air-conditioning, too! What will they think of next?

Did you assume that the seven-passenger minivan was invented in the '80s? Think again! that old microbus seated seven, or eight if the three in the back seat were good friends. Today's Dodge Caravan seats seven handily (with all three seats in place), though space is at a premium in that rearmost seat. Entrance and exit are far simpler with today's minivan since the addition of a second sliding door on the driver's side. Though the seating layouts are similar, the amenities of the 2002 are far "cushier" than the old '73, featuring comfortable seats with handy storage cubbies (including six of those ubiquitous cup-holders) and ceiling-mounted controls for the rear-seat climate system. Oh, and of course, now there are mirrors in the sun visors, two power ports, an underseat drawer on the passenger side, and a tilt wheel with cruise control... It makes the old microbus look positively antediluvian!


<b>...The More Things Stay The Same</b>

Still and all, though, some things don't seem to change: there's still a bowling alley running between the front seats, and storage capacity behind the back seat is almost laughable. The Caravan, with its shorter body, has even less luggage "space" than the Grand Caravan. I also noticed that the modern version, like its predecessor, has a tendency to change lanes unexpectedly in high winds. Perhaps more than anything else, though, the minivan -- like the microbus -- has symbolic value. The symbols are vastly different, it's true, but they're both symbolic!


<b>The Modern Minivan: So Much for Nostalgia</b>

The SE model's 3.3-litre V6 puts out a nominal 180 horsepower (seems to me the dual-carb 1600cc engine in the bus was 80 hp), sufficient to move the minivan smoothly in traffic and to provide better-than-average acceleration up freeway onramps. A 3.8-litre 6 that tops out at 215 horses is available in other trim lines. The four-speed automatic overdrive transmission shifts smoothly under most conditions, with little hunting except under the most radical moves. <i>[Author's note: acceleration? the microbus was zero to sixty in fifteen minutes!]</i>  This engine/transmission combination yielded a somewhat less than stellar 19.5 MPG in my five hundred miles of driving. 

The mini's handling lies about midway between that of domestic passenger cars (<i>e.g.</i> the Chevrolet Malibu and Buick Century) and the better-handling full-sized SUVs. The driver's connection to the road is actually fairly good, and the Caravan takes bumps and uneven road surfaces in stride. Parking is relatively easy, assisted by the forward position of the front wheels.

The difference between the two archetypes of minivan-dom is most apparent, though, in the body styling. Where VW's microbus was unabashedly, even endearingly boxy; the modern minivan is sleek and aerodynamic, with a long, sloping nose. Stylistically, though, the Caravan / Grand Caravan series is about due for a makeover.


<b>Featuring...</b>

Here's my rundown on the features of the Grand Caravan SE:

<i>The Accelerator Pedal: Positive Waves</i>

+ Smooth handling and relatively good ride (this is in comparison to others in its class, mind you)
+ Above average (for its class) acceleration; from a standing stop or when reserve power is needed at highway speeds
+ Versatile seat configuration, with numerous combinations of folding and removable seats to add cargo space
+ Sliding doors on both sides
+ Clear instrument panel: speedo, tach, fuel, and temperature gages; everything else is an idiot light.
+ Labeling on switches and dials (as opposed to icons); intuitive function of toggles and push-buttons.
+ Storage compartments: medium-sized glove compartment, locking under-seat drawer, armrest compartments in the rear.
+ Two front power ports, one always on and one powered when the ignition is on (and they're <i>marked!</i>)
+ Cruise control has cancel switch (instead of off switch or brakes)

<i>The Neutral Zone: Take It or Leave It</i>

= White-faced dials on a black background, with Daimler-Chrysler's usual orange-tailed "spermatazoid" needles
= A mediocre sound system; and there's no CD player with the stock system
= Unimpressive fuel economy. The smaller four-cylinder might get better mileage, but at a corresponding decrease in acceleration.
= The climate-control system had some trouble with Houston's fall: I wonder how it does in summer!
= An uneven body panel seam or two and some minor finish problems.
= Stiff levers and switches on the seats; might be hard for smaller drivers and passengers to change out the seats.
= Less than intuitive dash-control layout

<i>The Brakes: Negative Territory</i>

- There's no console, only an open space between the front seats and a little cargo net. That means no secure nooks and crannies for stashing CDs, tapes, phone, coins, and the like.
- No middle- or rear-seat power ports
- Busy, tiny switches for power window and sound-system controls.
= Underbody mounted, compact spare tire (hate it, hate it, hate it!)
- Rear hatch can't be locked with the key.


<b>The Bottom Line</b>

I'm not a minivan fan (as much as I loved that microbus), though I much prefer them to the SUVs that have overrun the highways. Frankly, in a two-person + one dog family, a seven-passenger vehicle is superfluous. That being said, I was unexpectedly impressed by the Grand Caravan. Its ride is more comfortable than that of the SUVs I've driven, and it handles more nimbly as well. Handling, ride, and power are all comparable to that of a medium- or full-size sedan. I was a bit disappointed by the fuel economy, though it's better than that of many SUVs. 

If you're pondering a decision between a minivan and an SUV, I certainly encourage you to take a look at a Grand Caravan. If you're interested in a minivan, take a long look at this one (especially if you're dead set on a US-made vehicle). I would advise one thing, though, that you research the Caravan's reliability closely. Many early models had a history of transmission problems, although D-C appears to have solved this tendency. You should also consider build quality... As a friend of mine (a former UAW member at Ford) says, "Never buy a vehicle that was built during hunting season!"
