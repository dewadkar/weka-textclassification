            This review is for a Pre-Driven 1999 Nissan Altima GXE. September '99 was time for me to get a new car. I wanted something affordable (to fit into my budget) that was also overall a good car in most categories (i.e. gas mileage, safety, reliability, etc.). So I did my research online and discovered that one could not go wrong with a Honda Accord. So I went out in the Chicago area and priced Accords. I discovered some great prices but I also discovered even better prices for 1999 Nissan Altimas!

I've always had some interest in Altimas since I've often had to drive my supervisor's '96 Altima and I always thought that was a decent car. So I went back online to do some more research and discovered in comparison tests, side by side, the Altima and Honda Accord were closely matched. In some cases, the results and/or stats were even! Since I wanted a newer car with lower mileage (30K or below), the Accords were in the $15K to $17K range... still good pricing for Accords. But I discovered some 1999 Altimas in the $13K to $16K range.

I ended up buying a Titanium Mist-colored pre-driven 1999 Altima GXE with 30,000 miles. The color is like a light copper and looks great. The dealership says the car is a demo but either way, I'm guessing many of the miles on this car are highway miles since it's only a year old. The exterior has a few scratches here and there, very small and unnoticeable from 10ft away. The interior is immaculate. Came with all standard options which includes power windows &amp; locks, CD player, tilt steering, dual airbags and more. 

The final price I paid was $12,995. To me, it was a great deal for a car that is in almost perfect shape and drives great. It's a wonderful car that looks good, gets terrific gas mileage and handles like a charm. The last couple of years, the Altima was named a &quot;Best Buy&quot; in Consumer Reports for it's class. For that price, I don't think it can be beat.<br><br>
