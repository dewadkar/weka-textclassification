            I bought my 1993 Nissan Maxima GXE last year (Jun 2001) used. It had on it some 91,000 miles. I paid $5600 for it because it was in great shape and the owner had just replaced parts of the exhaust system.

I loved the car. Took it home, washed it, and began to enjoy it right away. But within the first week something struck me as unusual. The owner had never mentioned this. The car makes a "khrrrr....." noise when it shifts gears(my car is automatic by the way). I took it to my mechanic. He said its coming from the transmission. But when he drove it, it shifted fine. For him to investigate any further would cost me about $800 ( the cost of removing a transmission to look at it). Since I am in my last year of college I decided not to go forward with it. I decided to live with the problem. Also, the stock Nissan stereo was starting to die. It only worked on the front speakers and the LED came on and off at its own will. I spent about $160 buying a decent Sony car deck, which still runs fine.

Now, let's talk about the car in general. It is spacious. It has some great design qualities. Each door has a small courtesy lamp on it. There are 2 map lights, and a dome light which auto dims. The security system/ keypad is a godsent when you have groceries in your hand. The engine is powerful, but I have noticed that it only works its magic once warmed up. On cold winter mornings its as groggy as sloth. I like the rims, they are conservative but they add a touch of class not to be found in hubcaps. I keep my maxima very clean and so nobody realizes that it will be turning 10 years old next year. Its a good car and I plan on keeping it a long time , given that the transmission still works.

Other problems: if the brake fluid gets low the check brake light comes on. Hard to figure out why at first, but just top off the brake fluid and you should be fine. The power locks tend to fail when very cold. They actually fight the force of my wrist turning the lock so as to unlock it. Annoying and definitely an age related problem. 

The exhaust manifold has studs that tend to crack. A cracked stud will eventually make a god awful noise. Mine either have not cracked yet or are not making noise yet. Power windows can also go and the replacement assembly can cost upto $100. So if your window goes you are looking at $200 to get your mechanic to fix it. As I said before, put little trust in the stereo - it too will die sooner or later.

But my point is this. For all its quirks, this car is great. I really admire that early 90's design of cars. The Acura legend and Honda accord of this age are great examples. This car has style. Pure and simple. Its roomy and it does everything I want it to do. The ride it quiet, it handles well and the power comes through when I need it. Especially when I need to pass another car on the freeway. This engine does great at higher speeds. 

I plan on keeping my maxima for many more years. Just keep changing that oil, keep her clean and do maintainance from time to time and your maxima will treat you well.
