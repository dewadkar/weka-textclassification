            What can I say? You get what you pay for. Got my new Kia Rio in February 2002 and had to have the paint repaired on the drivers door. That was more of a dealer problem then something systemic. I gagged for the first 1000 miles as the preservative coating on the engine burned off. Though the dealer did mention the coating and the smell I was told that the smell would quickly leave, no more than a 100 miles or so. 

The major problem to date, about 9000 miles, has been a wind screech from what appears to be coming from the vents. The dealer could not find the problem, nor replicate, and I felt like the dealer thought I must be hearing things. Finally got a dealer rep in the car and demonstrated the problem. It does not always screech. When the wind hits the front just right and I'm driving over 65, the Banshee under the hood starts. The noise gets so loud at times that you cannot carry on a conversation in the car. Will be taking the car in tomorrow for the dealer to work the issue, but at least now I'm not the only one hearing the noise. 

Overall the car has performed fairly well for what I paid. Took a 3000 mile trip with the car and had no problems. I did a bit of testing of the car while on the trip and was surprised that the car had little handling problems at speeds over 100 mph, though I don't suggest trying this on your own. Gas mileage can range from almost 40 mpg to a low of 22.5. The low end is with high speeds and the air blasting away. The air on this little car is great. In the hot Texas sun I can freeze most folks out of the car. I had the dealer test the air and was told that the air is putting out 36 degrees. 

Not a bad overall deal, so far, for an inexpensive car. Now if I can only get the dealer to kill the Banshee.
