            OK, I admit it, I'm a bit of a car fanatic.  Over the years I've owned
a lot of high end sports cars (Porsche, Lexus SC 400 &amp; I now own a Jaguar
XK8 convertible)......BUT......yesterday I had a reality check and went
to test drive the Toyota Solara convertible.

Now mind you, I am driving a Jaguar now so I am accustomed to all the
bells and whistles.  But after having my little reality check and realizing that I'm driving around in a $60,000 car (I work out of my
home and last year only drove around 3,000 miles total).....I just couldn't justify keeping the Jaguar.

I went to the Toyota dealership and took the Solara for a ride and
was TOTALLY amazed.  This car drove just like my old Lexus SC400, the
handling was amazing and the ride was dead quiet.

The interior was adequate, leather seats, convertible roof, &quot;decent&quot;
sound system, cd player along with cassette player.  

It was very roomy and comfortable even in the back seat.  The back seat
also has the split fold down and has plenty of room for moving things
around or skis etc etc.

But the part that really blew me away was the price!!!!  I could get
this car totally loaded for around $31,000.  Now mind you, they also
have a V4 which is less expensive, or the hard top which will lower your
cost or cloth seats.....but for a totally loaded great looking car, I
thought this price was amazing.  

Needless to say the dealer couldn't believe I was trading in a Jaguar
for this Solara but the reality is......to save 50% and still drive
a great car it's more than worth it to me.

I think anyone would be happy with this car.  Even though it's a 2 door
it was very easy to get in and out of the back seat too.....

Good luck all<br><br>
