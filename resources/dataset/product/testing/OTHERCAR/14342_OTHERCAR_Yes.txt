            Well, before I begin to tell you about my new Nissan Altima, let me tell you a little story that my mother just told. She and a friend of hers happened to see me leave this morning and make my way towards my new car. I had to go shovel the snow off the car. Well, according to my mother, they both turned around towards me at the same time to see the biggest smile on my face. One would never imagine someone getting entertainment from shoveling snow, but I could not help but smile. There I was, standing next to my brand new car. How could you not smile? Well, I thought it was a cute story and definitely shows how much happiness Nissan Altima's bring to their owners.
The car itself is a beauty. I have the Nissan Altima GXE 2000 with a silver exterior and gray interior. It drives smoothly, brakes well, and accelerates well. The entertainment system in the car is good, but there is no cassette player. The CD system is standard in all Altima's. 
There are plenty of little extra's that seem to make life so much more convenient, such as a sunglasses holder in the roof, illuminated visor mirrors for both driver and front passenger. There are also cup holders in the front, as well as in the back...very nice for those who do not call shot gun in time. There is a cell phone holder on top of the center console, however i think it is better used for storing a little paper and some pens...there's a space underneath the radio system that can hold your cell phone.
I have the upgraded alarm in my car, which is seemingly good. But I find that whenever I unlock the car, for whatever reason, if I don't get into the car within a few minutes, the alarm goes back on. So for the past two weeks that I have had the car, it has snowed and I have had to go brush off the snow and I must've set the alarm off at least three times each time I've gone to clean it. 
The only other problem with the car, and it is through no fault of itself, is that the seagulls and pigeons find my care attractive too...So much that they feel the need to use it as their own personal bathroom. Right now my poor little car needs a good wash, but I want to wait until the weather clears up a bit. 
It's a nice small car that is comfortable to drive. For those who want the security and safety, this is the car. I trust my life with it.
