            Buick Century

  Classified as a Family Car which come is trim of Custom and 
  Limited 4 door models. Priced at between $19,840 and 
  $22,870. The reliability of the Century is better than 
  average and has been so for the past three years. The model 
  I test drove had was able to seat 6 adults, three in the 
  front and 3 in the back. Buick Century is front wheel 
  driven and operates on regular gas held in it's 17.5 gallon 
  tank. It has a 3.1 V6 engine which equates to 175 horse 
  power. Buick Century comes with automatic transmission with 
  4 forward speeds. The Century has a 109 inch wheel base and 
  is 195 inches in length, 73 inch width. Century yields easy 
  entry with it's 50.5 inch top of door to ground height. I 
  was able to transverse a U turn in a two lane road with out 
  having to put the car into reverse. It is reported to weigh 
  3.350 pound with the weight distributed 64% front and 36% 
  rear. It has ample luggage room in the spacious 17.0 cubic 
  foot trunk area. I found the head room to ample and both 
  the front and rear seating affords comfortable leg room. The 
  Century by Buick has standard ABS braking. The most 
  impressive thing about the Buick Century is it's past three 
  years reliability record. The drive was pleasant, but for 
  me I will keep looking before I buy. This is one for you to 
  check out if not for it's reputation alone.
