            I spent a lot of time shopping for a new car. I was looking for a reliable touring sedan that could handle the winter weather of the Northeast part of the United States while being a fun car to toss around on windy back roads during the Spring and Summer. The Acura 3.2 TL offered the ability to take on both these scenarios. The 3.2 litre engine and shiftable 5 spd automatic (similar to Porsche's Tiptronic transmission) offers one the ability to spend a very enjoyable Spring afternoon cruising windy roads, upshifting and downshifting to take advantage of the car's power band range. The front wheel drive and TCS system should prove to be useful in bad weather. My only complaints are that the car requires 92 octane gas and that service costs at the local Acura dealer are a little steep. Also, the position of the on/off button for the cruise control switch needs to be moved to an easier to view spot. Overall, this is a great car with a level of quality that one would expect to find in a much more expensive car.<br><br>
