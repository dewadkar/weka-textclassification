            I had first rented this vehicle because My other car was being fixed. I loved the car so much that I decided to buy it. 
The ride in the car is great! There is plenty of leg room, head room and even trunk space. The rear seat folds down if you need more space which is great. You can even fit a third person in the back seat if you have two car seats (which I do). It has a great sound system, great warrenity, just all around a great buy. It was very affordable. 
I like the fact that it is really easy to get in and out of the back seat. I have to put my two kids in ther and it is a breeze. no problems.
The only thing that I wish that my car would have is power windows and power door locks. I also think that the car is a little bit louder when you drive. I had a previous car like the sunfire you couldn't even tell that it was running, but the Sunfire you can definatly tell that it is running. 
I think that just about anybody would like this car. If a young person likes sporty cars this is defianetly an affordabe car.
