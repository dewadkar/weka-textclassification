            I purchased my 1988 Mazda RX-7 GTU from the original owner of the vehicle. The car is an outstanding example of an RX-7. It was raced regularly and garage kept whenever it wasn't on the track. The car came to me with no engine problems. The sunroof wasn't working correctly, but I was able to quickly repair this by cleaning the tracks. The seats are amazingly comfortable and race-engineered. Everything about the car is well designed. 

The rotary engine delivers smooth power all the way to 137MPH. Bringing the car into the higher RPM range doesn't negatively affect its lifespan in the least - in fact, regularly redlining the engine helps keep it healthy. The only true drawback to this car is that it requires a higher level of care and maintenance than most cars with reciprocating (piston) engines. Fluids such as oil, water, and coolant, have to be checked on a regular basis and changed regularly.

The  RX-7 is a wonderful car even by today's standards. For a 1.3L engine, it produces amazing amounts of power with minimal gas consumption for a sports car. Parts are not at all difficult to find. Help is available readily on the Internet, and the car has a cult following which makes owning it an adventure. The Mazda RX-7 is lightening in a world of thunder.
