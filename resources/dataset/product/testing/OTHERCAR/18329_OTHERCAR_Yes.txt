            I picked up a 2nd generation Eclipse for a change from the 4 wheel drive scene.  I gotta say I really enjoy this car.  I couldn't find a turbo all wheel drive at the time that I bought, so I settled for the front wheel drive, non turbo.  This was a mistake.  While the n/t is pretty quick and impressive, the turbo would help considerably.

Overall, it's been a good choice for us, good gas mileage, smooth running, and extremely well handling.  It is slightly &quot;rattley&quot;, but that's to be expected from most sport compacts.  I must say, it doesn't rattle nearly as bad as some vettes I've been in.  The only major thing I would say that Mitsu needs to work on is the manual transmission, it's a bit too &quot;crunchy&quot; for my tastes, possibly going hydraulic would help the situation.

If you're looking into the 2nd generation eclipses, go for it, you won't be dissapointed.  I love mine, but I will be selling it for a 98 or 99 GSX next summer, I gotta get a few more ponies to turn those wheels!<br><br>
