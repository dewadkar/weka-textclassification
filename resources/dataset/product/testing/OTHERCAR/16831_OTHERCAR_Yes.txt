                I just recently purchased a 94 camaro and I just absolutely love it.  This car has sheer power.  Mine is an automatic 3.4 litre and it has all the pick up and power that i want in my car.  Just by looking at the car you can tell that it is tough.  When i went to buy this car I actually wanted to get a Dodge Avenger but it was too far out of my price range so i went with the camaro and I am glad i did.  Right after i bought my Camaro one of my friends went out and bought an Avenger and he let me drive it and I am definately happier with my decision to go with the Camaro.  Now besides the performance of this vehicle the maintenance is extremely easy.  There is a ton of room under the hood the get in there and fix it if you ever have too.  The only thing i had to do so far with this vehicle is tighten the connection on the alternator because it was a little bit loose, but other than that I haven't had any problems with it.  That is pretty impressive since i bought the car used with 66,000 miles on it.  You might be saying to yourself &quot;it must be nice to be rich and own a camaro,&quot;  but you would be surprised what you can pick one of these up used.  I got mine for only $11,000.  So I will tell you what if you are in the market for a new car I would definately reccommend giving one of these a test drive and I guarantee you will fall in love immediately.<br><br>
