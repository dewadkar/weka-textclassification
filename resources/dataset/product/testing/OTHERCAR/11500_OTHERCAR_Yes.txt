            The Oldsmobile Bravada I feel is the best for the buck. Not only well built and more space, but pricing SUV's you will not find a better rig for the price. With standard options such as leather. Our Oldsmobile Bravada (1998) has stood up to the southern most point in the United States (Naalehu, Hawaii). Where the surf pounds, the red dirt flys and the trails are meant for a Hummer. This Bravada we have put to the test, from driving from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to 4X4ing the trails of South Point in Hawaii. No problems, no rattles and no bologna, this is the SUV with the &quot;Best bang for the buck&quot;!!<br><br>
