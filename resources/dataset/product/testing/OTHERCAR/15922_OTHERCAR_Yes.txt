            Last March my husband and I purchased a 2000 Mercury Sable program car. I had been driving a 1988  Mercury Cougar and I really hated to give it up. Unfortunately it's age was beginning to show but that was the best car I ever loved.  Now we had to shop for a replacement and since I had good luck with Mercuries in the past we went to many Mercury dealers. I finally fell in love with a silver, 200 horse power beauty. We took it out for a test ride and found it to be very quiet and easy to handle.
I love the idea that it has the gas and brake pedal which adjust up and down so short people like me don't have to sit so close to the console. It has an adjustible seat and a driver's side window that goes all the way down with one touch. Most importantly it has a child lock system and a safe place to put car seats in the back seat.
We bought the car for $15500 and have been enjoying it ever since.
It has a sun and moon roof and looks very sporty and so far has been good on gas....about 30 mile highway. Also it has a lot of room in the back seat.
I think that if anyone is looking for a good used car this would be a great choice.
