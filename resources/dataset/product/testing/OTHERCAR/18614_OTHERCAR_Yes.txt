            Even when i first saw the Alero at the time of its release, i was always impressed at the body styling.  At that time i did not have plans to buy a new car seeing that i was only 16 and i was driving my &quot;trusty&quot; ford tempo.  As my ford started to near its death, i decided that i wanted a new car.  At the time i was making a decent income for a 17 year and didnt have any other bills to pay so i had the ability to put much of my pay towards a car if i wanted to buy a new one.  Although my parents did not help pay for the car other than putting the loan under their named (because i did not have any credit at 17) they gave me the remaining credit on their GM credit card which they no longer use.  I purchased the base model GX with no options whatsoever, being july near the end of the model year i paid $15,300 compared to the sticker price of almost $17,000.

After a while of being thrilled that i had a new car, i came back down to earth and realized that the &quot;no options&quot; situation wasnt fun.  After recovering from the down payment that i paid i started to add some nice touches to my car.  As of today i have added a kenwood cd player with boston rally speakers and an mtx subwoofer and amplifier combo (totaling $1,400 with professional installation), a viper 600 esp security system for $400, american racing polished alloy wheels for $600, tinted windows, Sylvania cool blue headlamps and possibly a spoiler from razzi ground effects.  Now my car looks so nice i dont care that i have to roll up my windows :-)

The performance of my Alero is excellent, especially during the winter.  After driving it in the snow i was impressed how the 4 wheel discs and traction control system prevented sliding even in deep snow here in NY.  Even my mother, who drives a 98' buick rivera was impressed with my cars performance to the point that she considered buying an alero.  The only extreme dislike about my alero, is as most people point out, the cupholders.  However, other than the cup holders i am pleased with my cars performance as well as styling.<br><br>
