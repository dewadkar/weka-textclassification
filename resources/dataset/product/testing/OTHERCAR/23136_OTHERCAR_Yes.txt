            Actually my girlfriend said that. I only work as her nanny and drive her <b>2001 Chrysler Voyager</b> a few times a week around Lincoln. The infant twins go with me, too, of course, but they sleep through the ride and have no opinion. :-) My review will be based partly on her reasons for buying it and six-month experience as well as my few times driving it.

Chris and her husband needed a bigger vehicle for their growing family; with her teenager, his two young sons from a previous marriage and the new twins, it needed "space, comfort, security and a reasonable price." After trying out the Ford Caravan and a couple of other minivans, she liked the feel of the Voyager best. The others were either too low to the ground or too big or too long. SUVs were also much more expensive to boot!

I read a couple of reviews of the 2000 Plymouth Voyager, which it still looks similar to. It sounds like Chrysler improved the <b>flexible cargo space</b> because Chris loves it while people complained of it in the old modeL. She usually drops grocery or laundry bags inside one of the slde sliding doors after pushing the bench seat away. I do that, too, and it works very well and conveniently. Now if I had the older kids with me, that might not work, but it does when they are strapped in tightly!

Chris has few complaints rather amazingly. She couldn't be happier with its performance and I have ridden with her a few times, so I know it's true. The only thing she wishes she had gotten was<b> rear air</b>. The kids in the back will always complain of being warm, especially with the sun shining in through all the untinted windows (tinted is an extra option). I have suggested she plug in a fan for them.

I read that Consumer Reports don't rate vans or minivans too highly for their durability, but it seems to me and my friend/boss that times are achanging. The 2001 Chrysler Voyager has a <b>V6 cylinder and sensitive, reliable brakes</b> in pouring Nebraska rain. The dashboard is <b>especially well-lit and designed</b> for easy access. There are <b>two airbags, a standard AM/FM cassette and great air conditioning</b>, which also unfortunately eats up the <b>16 gallons of gas</b> faster. Last year's model formally is described as using Ethanol/Gas instead of just Gas, too, a telling change of the times perhaps?

<b>Conclusions</b>

It may not have the sleek, racy style of the PT Cruiser, or the gas mileage, but it doesn't look bad (just like Epinions' picture) and it works perfectly for a family of seven or just a nanny with twin infants. Her husband is 6'3" and doesn't feel cramped at all. I don't either at 5'9" and also enjoy the smooth, quiet way the Voyager maneuvers. Of course, no one has taken it out on the highway yet, so maybe it wouldn't be as quiet or smooth.

I can't see its performance going to pieces on the highway, though. There's too much quality in the improved design and material, I believe. Despite the 16 MPG in town with the air going full blast and no rear air on the base model, it is well worth the money we paid (with incentives) for the space, convenience, security and comfort of it.    

There's a 3 year warranty, I believe, and was taken in once for a minor recall, but that's all. The side door latches needed to be replaced because they would open if hit, so I would ask about that before buying. All in all my bosses and I are confident it will survive the abuse young boys and hard city driving give it, for at least 3 years or more.

Thanks for reading. I have no problems recommending it highly to all you dudes with broods. Let me know if I've helped. :-)
