            We had this car for rent for more than a week and that's what I think. It's poorly designed car. But let's start with gooddies:
+ good horse power, you can press gas pedal and almost fly on the highway
+ quite roomy
BUT other stuff is bad,folks:
- the seats are terrible,after 2 hours drive your back will be in   pain...
- bad noise isolation inside...
- car roof is very close to the driver's head (and considering that I'm   petite)...
- it leads to the bad visibility of course...
- also it looks to me that engine sounds too loud...                                                                                                
Who should drive this car? Definitely NOT a tall person and who really
likes Dodge/Chrysler. I didn't like it and lost all the respect to Dodge cars at all.
