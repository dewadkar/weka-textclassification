            After doing a LOT of research and looking around, I bought the Dimage 7Hi about a month ago... and I couldn't be happier. I considered the Nikon 5700. But, after seeing it in person and trying it out, I was unimpressed. One thing that really bothered me was that for such an expensive camera, it has a relatively small 1.5" LCD monitor on the back. The 7Hi with its 1.8" viewing screen is just more camera. And, you can zoom in on any part of the image and easily scan from side to side to make sure you like the result. On top of that, the features on the 7Hi are incredible! It feels and acts like a traditional 35mm SLR. By comparison, the Nikon 5700 just feels "chincy" to me. 

With all of the settings on the 7Hi, I like the fact that I can set the aperture and shutter speed and customize white balance, etc. and save my settings in one of 4 memory slots for future similar use. I can easily come back to those settings by choosing that memory slot from the onscreen menu. And then, without pause, my wife (who is shall we say "technically challenged") can pick up the camera, press the "P" button and have an idiot-proof camera ready to point and shoot. Touching this button immediately resets all settings to "automatic". And, the results on automatic are great! If she is really adventurous, I showed her how to push the easily accessible program button to set the camera for Portrait, Sports, Night Portrait or Sunset mode. 

One feature that really sets this camera apart from the Nikon and every other digital I've looked at is the 64mb buffer. This allows me to point and shoot -- shot after shot in succession -- without waiting for the internal memory to write to the flash card. In fact, when you set the drive speed to High Speed Advance, you can take 3 frames per second by just pointing and holding down the shutter release -- just like my 35mm SLR. And, incredibly, when you set the drive to UHS (ultra-high-speed), it takes 7 frames per second!! I used this feature last weekend at my daughter's soccer game, and got great results. My friends and I also used it on the golf course to get the full, step-by-step view of each other's golf swings. You don't get these features in any other digital camera that I know of. 

Some novices may be initially intimidated by all of the dials and adjustments -- I've read such reviews. Although the 7Hi appears complicated at first glance, in reality - everything is laid out logically and not complicated at all. Don't be scared off by comments saying that it's too hard to learn. It really isn't. If you're really hesitant because of all of the features, I've seen a step-by-step video, designed for the 7Hi, being sold on e-Bay that you may want to look into. 

I have to say that I just love this camera. I ponied up the cash ($180 on e-Bay) for a Transcend 512mb Ultra high speed 25x Compact Flash Card. With this baby under the hood, I have on inhibitions to just point and shoot, point and shoot, point and shoot. With my 35mm SLR, I would always be waiting waiting waiting for the perfect shot... knowing that I had to be judicious with my roll of film. Not any more. Now, I just point and shoot without concern - knowing that I will only print those shots that I really like on my HP Photosmart 7350... and I'm very very happy with the results. 

NEGATIVES: 
I really only have 2 negative comments about this camera to speak of. The first has to do with the built in date/text feature, allowing you to record the date or a text box on the image. I have small kids and want to be able to show the date on my prints -- for future reference. But, I don't like the way the 7Hi records this information. Unlike a traditional date-back on a 35mm SLR (which places the date transparently on the image in yellow digital font), the 7Hi creates a white rectangular field that is placed in the lower right corner - on top of the image, with the date in large black digital font within the white rectangle. This actually covers up a part of the image and really sticks out like a sore thumb. After using this feature for a couple of weeks, I have decided to turn it off, and will instead add the date, after-the-fact, with my digital photo editor (Adobe Photoshop Elements). It's a bit of a hassle, but I'm only doing it with the photos that I actually print. You can see some examples of the Minolta auto-date feature that I dislike in some pics that I've posted at:

My second negative comment relates to an apparent manufacturing defect that I've read about in the Minolta forum at dpreview.com. It seems that a number of people have discovered tiny cracks in the camera body immediately around the screw holes next to the AF/MF button (on the side of the camera). Apparently, the screws were overtightened on some production runs during assembly. I've closely examined my camera and, thankfully, I have no cracks. I will continue to keep an eye on this, however, to make sure that none develop. If you buy (or already own) a 7Hi, you should look carefully to see if yours has this defect. According to some of the folks in that discussion group, Minolta is making good by repairing - and in some instances replacing - those defective cameras. You can read more about this problem at:

Finally, a note about battery life. I've read several people comment about how this baby eats through batteries. And, if you are constantly thumbing through your images on the LCD screen, and using the flash, etc. the batteries do go quickly. But, in my opinion, this is a small price to pay for the features that this camera offers. Importantly though, since the 7Hi takes over-the-counter AA's (rather than some $50 proprietary battery that you have to buy from the manufacturer), you can always pick up replacements in a pinch - just about anywhere in the world. I went out and bought 3 sets of NIMH 1800mah rechargable Rayovacs (in addition to the set that the camera comes with) for about $14 bucks a set. I keep them all charged and always have several backups in my camera bag. One note in this regard that I read somewhere - I've numbered each set so they don't get mixed up. It is supposedly better to use them and recharge them - in sets... so that all 4 in each set have the same life cycle and charge. You'll supposedly get better performance that way. 

All in all, pros and cons considered, -- this is without question the best camera -- from a quality and feature standpoint, that I've ever owned. Get one for yourself, and I'm sure you'll be impressed too.
