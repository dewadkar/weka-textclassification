            I wanted a camera that I could easily carry in my jersey pocket when cycling through Tuscany Italy, then continue to use in all sorts of travel and cycling back home.  I wanted point-and-shoot ease; manual controls were not important to me.  I wanted a good lens and 4 Megapixel (for cropping and enlargements).

The Canon Powershot S400 was my choice - and it does meet all of my requirements better than any other camera I could find.  To ensure that I can use it all day when I'm traveling I purchased 2 spare batteries and 2 additional CF cards.  

The camera is very easy to carry, handle, and use.  It's VERY small and VERY light.  Easily pocketable.  Mostly metal and pretty scratch resistant.  Good 3x optical zoom Canon lens.  Uses readily-available CompactFlash memory but proprietary (expensive) batteries.  I found that After5PM.net sells a 1200 mAhr battery (about 70% higher capacity than the Canon NB-1LH that comes with the camera) for $40 with free shipping.

The pictures are sharp and colorful.  The controls are pretty straight-forward and easy to learn.  All you really need to be able to do is select the image size and compression level!

Don't count on the flash for more than about 7 or 8 feet.

Members of American Express Rewards note:  This camera is available FOR FREE using your American Express Rewards points - that's how I got my camera.  It didn't cost me a dime, but I had to enter $1 for amount paid or this system assumed I didn't enter a price.
