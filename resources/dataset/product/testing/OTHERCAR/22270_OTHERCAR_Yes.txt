            Toyota has continued to dazzle its customers with the release of its 6th generation truck and the Tacoma nameplate.  This is a truck that was designed and built in America.  If one thing is clear, it's that Toyota's compact-pickup line has been doing very well.  For those of us who are looking for a truck alternative, the Toyota Tacoma appeals to the consumer's need for an alternative.  So far, the image it portrays seems to catch on easily with the normal car enthusiasts.  The Toyota Tacoma's styling is very beautiful.  It also sports some sort of rugged image which is backed by Toyota's many years of quality and reliability in the automotive marketplace.

I had the opportunity to test-drive a brand new 2003 Toyota Tacoma a few weeks ago.  Owned by one of my colleagues who got tired of driving a normal sedan, the 2003 Toyota Tacoma is appealing to everybody: men and women.  On a beautiful day, a buddy of mine surprised me with her truck. Being on the road for what seems to be a very long commute to jobs in the Bay Ara, this truck's owner needed a light truck to put miles on.  In addition, with the high costs of gas, a small truck is all she ever needed.  

<b>What have I found out about this truck?
</b>

<i>All you need to do is to make your pick and go for the fun experience</i>

Available in quite various shapes and size, the Tacoma line up comes in various formats:  For example, you are going to find the following:  Toyota Tacoma regular cab, extra-length Xtracab, Four-door Double Cab, a performance-driven S-Runner Xtracab V6 and the PreRunner, a 4x2 truck that has the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4x4 models.  What is clear is that the 4-wheel-drive Tacomas come in Xtracab only this year.  

<b>What did I observe in the 2003 Toyota Tacoma?</b>

On the outside, you will taken in easily by the smooth lines of the truck.   It appears that the 2003 Tacoma was designed to improve performance and reliability on the road.  I had no problems negotiating the freeway of the Great Central Valley.  Perched at a pretty nice height, I was able to swerve in and out of the heavy traffic of the Bay Area of California.  The 2003 Tacoma has a relatively small platform to build on.  There is less weight to carry around.  I have observed that the truck has enough head, hip and leg space.  My 4-door tester ended up providing a smooth and easy performance.  I had great visibility in the driver's seat.  The 4x4 Toyota Tacoma has a 150-horsepower 2.7 liter.  It also has a child-restraint system.  

<b>Final considerations</b>

This truck is a great buy.  Using it will only enhance  your business opportunities.  

Good luck purchasing this truck.
