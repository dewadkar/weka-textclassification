            I've had my new toy for about 6 months now and I'm so impressed.


 </B>Prepurchase stuff</B>
     I Decided a few months into the new year that I needed a REAL digital camera (I previously had a jam cam which worked but not wonderfully) oh okay I may not have NEEDED it but I wanted it! So I began my search, when I decide I want something I'm typically way too impulsive and hasty to get it. I wanted to just go out to Wal-Mart and pick out a polaroid or Kodak but I chose my Dad as my shopping partner, he did some research then I did some research. Seems he has a bias, once upon a time he enjoyed the hobby of photography and had puchased a Nikon 35 mm which he still has and which still takes excellant pictures. So after some mini battles (and many many trips to Wal-marts, targets, k-marts, office max...okay you get the picture)over my wanting to buy one of the cheaper, easier to locate cameras I gave in! 

    </B> The actual purchase<B>

After making up my mind, I found a great deal on the Nikon coolpix 800, a flash card reader, and an extra 32 mb compact flash card on Ebay, bid and won it! 

    </B> My experiences since and various features <B>

For about a week after I got my nikon I carried it everywhere with me. Not having many picture opportunities though I mostly spent that time running through batteries trying to learn all the different functions on the camera. 
All in all to use the basic functions is not difficult. There are two different modes you can use Auto and Manual. I typically go with the Auto as I'm far from a pro and it's just easier to get lighting right for me. However, manual allows you to do more advanced things such as set the sensitivity and a nice feature of multi-shot photography. This is fun to play with. Basically, there are several variations but it allows you to take several pictures quickly. This would be a handy feature for taking kids pics, or for action shots. Another fun feature in my opinion is the ability to do black and white photos. The LCD screen is not huge but in my opinion it's large enough. The menu is fairly easy to use and a person shouldn't have too difficult of a time figuring out the basics. As for downloading onto your computer, I can't say how good or bad doing it directly from your camera is as I use my reader to download them and then use a program I have to view and tinker with the pictures.  From what I understand though you can only use Nikon's program (comes with the camera don't panic) to download them directly from the camera. As for quality, I think it's great (and I think I need a better printer but that's a whole nother story) the pictures become slightly blurred when enlarged much. Personally, it takes better pictures than my regular 35 mm does. But, I'll let you see...here is a link to a pic I took last week of one of my sunflowers right before it became oppressed by the heat!

It's actually not looking as good on the site as it really does...if you want to see it better leave a comment and I'll send you a couple samples.

  I've read alot of reviews complaining about the look of the camera. I don't really care but I sorta like it's look. To me it looks more like a regular camera than a digital one...which I feel more comfy with. I don't want some to know I'm holding an expensive digital camera and snatch it from me (can you tell I have purse snatching phobia...) I'd rather blend in with all the other camera's. There is also alot of mention of the door to the compact flash slot, and I can't lie it's all true...this thing is flimsy. I've been careful so far but it just isn't the best quality

</B> Some advice <B>

A little advice is to invest in a flash card reader, they don't require you to have your camera on or plugged up which saves on Batteries. 
Which is another thing, I quickly invested in Nimh batteries, easily rechargable and they last longer it is a wise purchase.

</B> Concluding Statements <B>
If you are looking for a mid priced digital camera that takes quality pictures look no further the Nikon is your man (or Camera as it where)
