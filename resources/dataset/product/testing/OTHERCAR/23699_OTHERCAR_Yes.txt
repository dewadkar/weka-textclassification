            I bought my Concorde in June 1999 and have been pleased ever since.  No other car on the road anywhere near the price can touch it for looks and room.  It's like having my dad's old Jaguar XKE without the stratospheric repair bills (unfortunately, without the V12 as well).  On top of it all, it gets good gas mileage, an important virtue for somebody who puts 75 miles a day on his work car.

Now with 65,000 miles on it, I've had to do very little to keep it in top form.  When a recent transmission fluid problem cropped up, it was repaired an a couple of hours by a mechanic for less than $100.  I change the oil, put in gas and get basic routine maintenance done and it keeps me rolling.

Downside: another reviewer commented on the electrical problems and I'll echo that.  Nothing critical like something in the ignition system, but a power window occasionally refuses to raise or lower and the driver's door power lock is working intermittantly now.  Again, it's a nuisance, not a handicap.  The only other complaint is the hood release latch: it's bad news.  First, I have large hands and can barely get my mitt under the hood to the darned thing and then, once I manage it, the lever is so flimsy that it bends rather than releasing the hood.  I generally have to get my wife to do it for me or I have to use a ruler to flip the thing open.  It's a pet peeve...when I have to get under the hood I'm usually not pleased to begin with and this certainly doesn't improve my mood any.
