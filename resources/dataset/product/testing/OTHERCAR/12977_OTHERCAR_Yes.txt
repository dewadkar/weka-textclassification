            A couple of months ago, I finally got the nerve to sell my 2001 Volkswagen Beetle (read my other review "The Friday Cars").

Before I decided on the Lexus, I had a look at alot of reviews about the car on epinions, motoring reviews and other opinion sites.  From what I read, most people are extremely happy with Lexus.  Just about all of them either have or would consider buying another Lexus.  Some went as far as buying another IS200/300.  This helped in making the decision easier and to convince my better half that we would be better off in a Lexus.

Australia has the choice of both the IS200 and the IS300.  The IS200 is, in terms of equipment specification levels, the same as the IS300 in the US (with the only exception being that the IS200 is a 2.0l 6 cyl rather than a 3.0l 6 cyl).  The Australian IS300 is the full kit.

In the last two months, I have found the Lexus to be a fantastic car to own.  The build quality is second to none.  It performs it's task really well - to get you from A to B in style.  This is a car I will definately keep for the term of the lease and maybe beyond that period.  

I have broken the review into a few different areas.

On the Road - Handling

I just completed a 3200km trip to the bottom of Australia and back.  All up, I have travelled 6000kms.  The car still handles exactly how it did the day I picked it up.  It drives like it is on rails, allowing you to throw it into the corners (which I sometimes do).  When you need to move, it moves.  When you need to stop, those big calipers grip the discs and stop in the car in no time at all.

Interior - Comfort & Equipment

I opted for the Sports Luxury pack.  This included the leather/escalane electric seats.  Most cars that I have had in the past as commuters usually make me tired.  Whenever I get out of the Lexus, I am always relaxed, the seats are that comfortable.  To top that off, Noise Vibration Harshness (NVH) levels are really low compared to any car that I have ever driven.  You can actually hear yourself think and hold a decent conversation.

The stereo is great for all but the "crank up the bass, feel the boot lid vibraiting" boys.  The sound is crystal clear.  I think Samsung have done a good job with this unit.  It is a 6 cd in-dash stacker and it is really easy to load.

Value for Money

Before looking at the Lexus, I did have a look at a Mercedes C200K Elegance (about AUD $75000 on the road) and a BMW 320i Executive (about AUD $70000 on the road).  With the Germans, the options list read like a novel and everything was optional (including the COMAND system for which they don't have a CD for Australia).  

You can imagine the shock when I picked up my car for AUD $61000 and that include two of the three options on the option list - a sunroof and automatic transmission.  The only other option is the DVD-based satellite navigation.  

On top of this, if your car needs servicing, a loan car is sent to your home (the other prestige brands do not do this).  Break down more than 100kms from home, free accomodation for you and your family.  Free parking when you go to the Opera House, golf days, drive days.  The list goes on.  Also, the first two services are free.

Service

The service I received from the Lexus dealership was excellent.  I called the dealership to ask what the sticker price was on the vehicle.  The dealer offered to drive to my workplace and take me for a test drive.  This is really handy as most of us don't want give up our weekends test driving cars.  When the dealer arrived, we went for a drive and then to lunch to discuss a deal.  He offered $3000 below sticker price without haggling plus free tinting for the front windows and a weekend away at a 5 star hotel.

We haggled for a bit and reduced the price by another $2000 (in lieu of the weekend away).

When I picked up the car, the dealer took the time to walk me through everything, made sure I was happy, and presented me with a 5yr old bottle of Chandon, plus some really expensive roses for my wife.  What more could I ask for?
