            I have one of the originals.  It was purchased in 1990 in NJ and now resides in Southern Florida since 1992.  This is truly a poor man's sport car but also a terrific second or play car for any stable.  Since purchase, I have only had to replace the clutch once, a switch in the transmission once, and I had a new top put on under warranty because the dealer couldn't replace the rear window so they replaced the entire top. Mileage has been consistantly around 30 mpg and now with 55,000 miles, it still doesn't require any special maintainence or oil.  The only negative I have and it doesn't reflect poorly on the car is that I can't use it with the top down in the summer.  Where I live, it's too hot to run with the top down, but in the winter, Sept to April, the top is down all the time.  Most people I meet seem to ogle the car more than they do expensive cars.  They feel that the Miata &quot;has class&quot;.<br><br>
