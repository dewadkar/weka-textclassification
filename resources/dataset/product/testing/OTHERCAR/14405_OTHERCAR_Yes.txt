            Again I am another poster that does not own one of these fine automobiles...but I sold them new and used for a couple of years
In doing so I have had the opportunity to drive these fine automobiles (along with just about everything else with wheels) and I can tell you that there is NIGHT AND DAY differences between the Countach and the Diablo.  Like everything, as technology improves so do the products that it effects.  The Countach was a fantastic automobile for the decade that it was engineered (the 70's) but that technology is snuffed out by the 500 horsepower 90's automobiles.  As another reviewer pointed out the Countach is a little underpowered in todays market making it seem more corvette like as opposed to the Italian thunder that it portrays...I also noticed that in his column he had paid about 75 grand for a 83 Countach in todays market you can buy a slightly used diablo non VT like a 91 or a 92 for less than 100,000 dollars...now while this may be out of reach for most of us remember that this is an investment and could (should) appreciate in value while you get the enjoyment out of the car now.  You do have to pay attention to maintaining the car though which can get to be expensive...I had a customer tell me that he had to sell his Diablo because it was nickle and dimeing him to death...5 grand here 10 grand there.  I say (and with a good deal of experience behind me) forget the Countach and buy a Diablo and if you are saying &quot;a hundred grand?!? My house cost a hundred grand!!&quot;  just remember that you can always sleep in your Diablo but you can't drive your house to the grocery store.<br><br>
