            One of the best of the 15+ cars I've owned, my '85 740 Turbo has been for the most part a reliable, safe and environment-friendly machine that still gets compliments on its looks and performance.

As with any 15-year old car, things start to go, but most have been cosmetic: the sun-roof handle doesn't snap back up, a crack in the door panel, faded dashboard knobs, burned-out bulbs and so forth.

Major, unexpected repairs have included a transmission bearing and seal (but not the transmission), air conditioner compressor &amp; seals (hey, these dry out with age!), and the timing gear. The latter may have been the result of my not replacing the timing belt when scheduled; it broke on the freeway, and I was forced to use a mechanic who was not familiar with Volvos. As with all foreign cars, repairs and parts are higher, but regular maintenance has kept them to a minimum (thus far, anyway).

We've taken our Volvo camping in all sorts of terrain and climates, sometimes with more than 800 pounds of passengers and cargo, and it performed admirably. At 125,000 miles, it burns little oil, and we get about 20 mpg in the city, 25 mpg on the open road. The turbo makes passing and acceleration stress-free.

One of the things we enjoy the most, and a motivating factor in purchasing the car, is that it keeps its looks so well. As with all &quot;Swedish Bricks&quot;, its styling is timeless, and people are often surprised to learn it's an '85. Unlike many, if not all, U.S.-made cars, Volvos don't look obsolete after 3 years, and always look unique. 

I recommend this car to anyone, but especially for active families who want performance, reliability and safety.<br><br>
