                 We bought a 1994 Buick LeSabre used in 1998. We had just gotten custody of my step daughter and we needed a bigger car. Our kids are grown up size and we will be adding on to our family and didn't want to have to buy a new car to go with a new baby. We had looked at Suburbans, but they were just to expensive, even used. We decided on a Buick and after a test drive, we bought it. I am the primary driver of the car and I really like it. I am short, but the seat adjusts so that I feel that I am sitting in a position to see the road and over the wheel safely. I like the options we got, I was hoping for remote locks, but when you buy used you get what you get. We have had no major repairs or maintainance to do on the car yet. It has 104,000 miles on it now, and I keep thinking we are going to have a major problem soon, just because I worry too much, not because anything is acting funny. The kids love the back seat. My 14 year old is 6 foot tall and she says she can slouch in the seat and still have leg room. Three grown ups fit comfortably in the back. My only complaint is that the passanger air bag doesn't have a turn off key so my 10 year could sit up front. I would recommend this car to any family of four or five or any couple who likes to drive with company in the car. My family always makes me drive now that we have the Buick!<br><br>
