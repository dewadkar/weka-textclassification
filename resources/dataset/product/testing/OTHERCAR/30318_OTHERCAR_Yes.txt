            I have owned three Plymouth Voyagers.  Two were 1992 models, and one 1996 model. The original 1992 model, I got almost new in 1993.  It was LOADED, and I never had ANY problems with it.  When I got to Texas, I decided I was &quot;too cool&quot; to be driving a minivan, and needed a truck.  (loved my truck, too, but that's another review)!  In 1996, I had outgrown my &quot;too cool for a minivan&quot; stage and decided the new Plymouth Voyager with the second side door was what I really needed as a busy Mom.

That van was obviously a lemon.  It literally spent more time in the shop 
than out during the three months that we had it.  The visors split apart at the seams.  It died on a freeway in Detroit, MI going 65 mph.  Luckily, it started right back up, but it did that several times before we got back to Texas.  A computer chip was replaced and that problem was solved.  It began running poorly.  Took it to the shop.  Defective spark plugs.   One of the most potentially dangerous problems I had was the fact that when I was driving, if I took off too quickly, occasionally the driver's side seat would slam to the rearmost position and I would not be able to reach the pedals.  There were at least two times that I had to quickly unbuckle my seat-belt and slide up under the wheel so I could reach the brake, stop the van and fix the seat back to where I could again reach the pedals.  Again, some minor adjustments at the shop and that was fixed.  The last straw was when we were in San Antonio and the key jammed in the ignition and would NOT come out.  It was a Friday afternoon, so we had to cut our trip short and drive back to the dealership so they could attempt to get the key out.  It took them a week and a half to get the required parts to do so, as they could not remove the key without replacing the steering column.  My confidence in this vehicle was SHOT, to say the least. 

In early February of this year I again bought a 92 Grand Voyager.   It is 
much little less fancy than the ones I had the first two times, but is great for hauling my 3 kids and all their friends around.  I love the spaciousness and comfort of this vehicle. I love the high seating 
position in which I feel totally in control of the vehicle and can see what's coming up ahead better than I could in a sedan.

The interior of my van is the dark maroon colored velour cloth. I am amazed at the durability of this fabric. I also love the color for it's stain-hiding abilities.  

This van, like my first one, has the three point harness Integrated child 
safety seats. I love them; they are very easily and quickly adjusted to 
different sized children and fold back into the seat when not being used. I am convinced that these are safer than portable, removable car seats. I 
recently heard a radio report that cited the statistic that 4 out of 5 
car-seats were improperly installed in the vehicle.  This is a scary 
statistic, and again makes me happy that I do not have that worry.

In comparing the van I have now to the newer model, I have to admit there are definite advantages to the newer models.  

     *The second sliding door on the driver's side was VERY convenient.  
     *The stereo system on the newer model is curved towards the driver         and I was able to reach it without leaning over.  
     *The road noise is MUCH less with the newer model--very noticeably       so.
     *Maneuverability:  I was amazed at the tight turns I could make with       my 1996 minivan.  This is NOT a small vehicle and yet, I could            handle it very easily. In this van, I feel like I am driving a       semi-truck.

I love my &quot;older&quot; Voyager.  I have my reservations about the newer ones based upon my personal experience with the 1996 model that we purchased.  I have known other people who have loved theirs and have not had one problem with it.  For me, with the track record I've had, I'll stick with the 92 model for now.
