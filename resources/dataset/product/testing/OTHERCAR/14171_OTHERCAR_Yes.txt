            I just got back from a week's vacation where I drove a rental 2000 Voyager over 1200 miles. I drove up and down the state of California from San Francisco to San Diego and many points in between. For the most part, I like the Voyager but there are a few things I don't like. 

The Voyager is a terrific convenience car. It holds lots of people or things and the ride is very smooth and comfortable. If you like to kick back and relax when you drive, this is an excellent car. The seats are comfortable and fatigue never really seems to set in as it will in many other cars.

I found the V6 to provide ample power for traveling over the Grapevine (a notoriously difficult and steep stretch of road just North of Los Angeles). I easily cruised straight up the mountain. I also enjoyed the powerful air conditioner which kept everyone cool and didn't impact performance as I climbed the steep hills.

Now the bad stuff. 

This car is horrible on twisty mountain roads. I drove up to Big Bear and fought with the transmission each and every foot of the 7000 foot climb. The problem is that the transmission will shift mid-turn and you practically lose control of the vehicle. As you enter a turn and apply the gas, the car lurches forward as it changes to a lower gear. Very unnerving. You can minimize the problem by sticking the car in low gear, however this poses problems of its own. Low gear is actually more than one gear, go about 30 MPH and it's 2nd or 3rd, slow down to 15 MPH and it's 1st. Once in 1st, the car won't shift back into 2nd or 3rd without putting it back in drive. Needless to say this means wrangling with the tranny all the way up or down a hill. 

The handling is about what you might expect from an oversized station wagon. Don;t expect to zip around corners the way you can in your Honda. Nice and easy does it in the Voyager. Again, heading up or down twisty mountain roads requires patience. You'd be surprised how slowly you must take corners to avoid losing traction.

Finally, one small annoyance is that the parking brake release and the hood release are within inches of each other and if you don't look carefully you can easily open the hood instead of releasing the brake. Then you have to get out of the car and close the hood. But don't forget to set the brake before going out the to close the hood! Okay, you're back in the car, now release the brake... darn! Popped the hood again. :^) 

All in all I was impressed with the Voyager's comfy ride, but the transmission and handling problems make me wish for a sporty Audi or Volvo station wagon instead.
