            I was seduced by the stainless steel body and the sleek design. There's a lot of ugly ducklings in the digital camera field; this one actually looks cool.

It also works cool. No glitches or bugs (like I've experienced all too often with other computer gadgets), just simple, total reliability. How refreshing is that!

I found the menus and controls to be pretty intuitive. It hardly took any time at all to master this thing (but then... I'm more gadget-savy than some).

I like the battery system. The camera comes with a rechargeable battery and a charger. After 2 hours of charging, you've got more then enough juice to cover the average outing. If you want to take more than 70 pictures, or use the flash a lot, a spare battery might be a good idea.

The included 8MB memory card is sufficient for about 12 good quality shots, or 50 web-quality shots. That's plenty for short excursions for me. With optional more memory, the possibilities are crazy!

The picture quality was good, especially on 4x6" prints, but I was slightly disappointed by close scrutiny. I'm used to seeing maximum detail and rich colors from high-quality scans of my Kodachrome slides. The detail and the saturation isn't quite there with this camera. If you're REALLY uptight about maximum image quality, this may not be your choice.

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a good all-round camera that's so portable you can take it everywhere, this camera works great. For snapshots, it's perfect. I've also used images on 8 1/2 x 11" promotional flyers with satisfactory results, and there's way more than enough resolution for web illustrations.

Bear in mind that with this model, you're paying a lot for the looks and the durable materials, which are very cool, to be sure. For maximum image quality, you'll need to go to the higher-end models and for more bang for your buck, you might want to forsake the stainless steel and save $100 or so. Or you can go ahead and get the Canon S-110 and enjoy owning one of the coolest shirt-pocket cameras of all time.
