            I have never really been a fan of SUV's and still am not a big fan of their styling or handling.  However the first time I laid eyes on the RX300 I knew I wanted one.

When I was 16 I had a Chevy Camaro, when I turned 19 I got a Pontiac Firebird, when I was 20 I got a used Nissan Maxima and immediately fell in love with the comfort and room of luxury cars.  To be able for me and 3 of my friends to all get in without having to slide behind someones seat was joyful bliss.  To be able to ride down the road and barely feel bumps, and the lack of road noise made driving a pleasure.  After years of stiff suspension and loud motors the smooth ride and low noise was a welcome change.  So it makes sense that when I began looking for my new car I would look for a 4 door luxury vehicle with a smooth ride and room to spare.

Well in 1998 I caught my first glimpse of the RX300 on a webpage and thought to myself &quot;what is that?&quot;  Well to my surprise the answer was, Lexus's new small SUV.  Built on one of their car frames.  This SUV had it all, a smooth look, a smooth ride (allegedly, at least that is what magazines claimed), and a really cool center console screen that looked like something out of starwars.  However I knew I wouldn't be owning one of those anytime soon, since I had just graduated college.

The following year, after having car problems I decided to trade in the Firebird and decided to look at the Lexus dealership.  I test drove some used ES300's, and even a new ES300 and was amazed at the comfort and feel of these vehicles.  Then I decided to just test drive the RX300 just to feel if it rode like a typical SUV or like the luxury cars that all these magazines claimed.  I was completely amazed at the ride, smooth, responsive, quiet, forgiving, I just ran out of words to describe it.  I was hooked.  I later returned with my wife to let her test drive it and she was amazed at how easily she was able to drive it and how little effort it took.  Plenty of room for a stroller and a baby seat for future considerations.  She too quickly became hooked.

Needless to say the car...oops SUV sold itself, I don't even remember talking to the salesman about the the RX300's features.  I just knew I wanted it, and so after all the paper work was over we became the proud owners of the best SUV made in my opinion.  A year later I still believe I made the right decision.  The RX300 (we lovingly refer to it as Lex) has been in the shop only for its scheduled tune ups.  It has performed beautifully for us with 0 complaints.  I highly recommend at least test driving one especially if you are unsure if you want an SUV, you never know it might just change your mind.<br><br>
