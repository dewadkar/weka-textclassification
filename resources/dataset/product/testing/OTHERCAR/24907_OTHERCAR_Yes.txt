            I was never a pickup truck person before I bought this vehicle. My previous two cars were a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Chevy Suburban.  I loved the room of the Suburban but needed a smaller vehicle to fit in my new garage.  While looking at smaller SUV's I came across the Ford Explorer Sport Trac which combined the idea of an SUV and a small pickup truck.  I was not that impressed with the Ford Vehicel and even less impressed with their sales staff.  I decided to look at the Nissan Frontier as an alternative.  Although it is designed as a pickup truck it has many of the same features and design properties of the Nissan Extera SUV.  The crew cab is very comfortable in the front but has cramped legroom and space in the rear.  I would say the rear seats are more for cargo and an occasional rider or a child passenger.  If you plan to travel with more than 2 adults for a long period of time it will be cramped.  The cab is loaded with all of the luxurary features you would find in many cars and suv's.  A 6 disk in-dash CD changer, Leather seats, "loaded" stero system, Cruise control, tilt wheel, dual airbags, moon roof etc.  The bed comes in two sizes and I chose the larger which also has a fold in bed extender which serves two purposes, when extended it makes your bed length over 8 feet and as big as as "full-size" pickup bed.  When folded in it holds items to the rear of the bed such as groceries or boxes.  The truck comes in 4x4 and handles well like a SUV.  While the gas mileage is not GREAT (around 13-15MPG) it far exceeds what I got in my Suburban.  The truck is comfortable to drive and is just as suitable to drive to a cocktail party as it is to move a load of mulch or wood.  I have only had the truck for about 4 months and have only had 1 service problem, yesterday I had to have the engine control module reprogrammed, the dealer took the car, gave me a loaner and had the work completed within 4 hours, a convienance I never received from my Jeep and Chevy Dealers.
