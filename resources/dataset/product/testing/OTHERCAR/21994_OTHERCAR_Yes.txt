            The HP 812 has become our family camera.  Everyone in our family uses this camera for vacations, holidays, goofy pictures around the house, pictures of the pets, and just plain having fun with it.

The HP 812 is a very easy camera to master.  My six year old learned how to use this camera in about the time it took me, a thirty something year old (about 5 min.).  Portability, well it fits in my shirt pocket.

The camera cost $399 at Office Depot and then came with an extended one year full replacement warranty ($45 value), camera case ($10 value), and a 64mb memory card ($55 value)at no charge.  These free extras were given to us at time of purchase.

There are some extras we purchased.  One of these extras is the HP 8881 camera dock for about $79.  This is a must.  Charging rechargeable batteries and downloading pictures to our computer is breeze with the dock.  Cables, batteries, and software are included.  It was very easy to understand and load the camera's software on to my computer.  

The other extra that we purchased is a 256mb memory card.  The card cost $129 and there are several different companies that make them.  A 256mb memory card allows about 200 pictures to be stored in the camera.  This is great for those long vacations or just snapping a few pictures of the same scene until you get just the right one (like everyone's eyes open) without worrying about running out of picture space in the memory card.

The quality of the printed picture has a lot to do with the printer and paper used.  We use the HP Photosmart 7550 printer with HP inkjet 9 mil photo paper.  The quality exceeds our local one hour photo lab and at a lot less cost.  Selecting and printing a picture is as easy as pressing a button and the camera's software walks you through the rest.

If a problem with the camera of software ever happen, even if it is my fault, we can always call HP at 1-208-323-2551 and talk to a technician.  The first year is free (well my long  distance charge is 7 cents a min. but big deal for the convenience).  I have used this phone # for other HP products and have had no or very little wait time.  We received quick and easy answers.  HP's Tech line was 50% of our buying decision, while the other 50% was ease of use and the features this camera offers.

We have found that this camera works well in all types of lighting (indoor and outdoor) and zooming is quick and easy.  

This opinion comes from an average family with no technical experience.  We just like to point, shoot and print good pictures.  This camera does this for us with 100% reliability and it's easy to use.
