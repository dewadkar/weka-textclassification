            I had been wanting a digital camera of sorts for over two years when I finally found room in my X-Mas money budget to get one. I had $500, the most I'd ever received for a holiday, or whats more, the most money I've ever had at once. I decided to spend most of it at Circuit City. I wanted a digital camcorder, but I also wanted many other expensive things and I couldn't get a camcorder plus accessories that I felt satisfied with for under $500. I made a painful, yet necessary, decision to wait on the camcorder and get some other things I really wanted, pay for the $80+ worth of items I got off Ebay and never sent in the money for, and get late X-Mas presents for my family and friends. This camcorder was one of the items I decided I NEEDED one night at 2AM while browsing the Circuit City website. Luckily, it was on special, and there was a $70 mail-in rebate for it (which I receieved just this last week). The camera seemed perfect. It had more options than any other for the price being asked ($120 - $70 rebate), and it had all good customer reviews.

<b>PICTURE QUALITY</b>

The quality is superb. When compared with that of the $500 Sony Mavicas that I use for the newspaper at my school, this camera takes BETTER pictures. They are less fuzzy and more easily tweaked, though it is harder to get correct lighting with the Kodak, but this is only due to the non-adjustable brightness of the flash. 
There are 3 settings: good, better, and best. This really only affects how big the pic will be on ur puter (resolution), not the quality itself.

<b>FEATURES</b>

This camera has zoom, a thorough menu, flash, auto-flash, and a LCD screen. The zoom is only 2x and the picture quality is reduced when you use zoom, plus you have to use the LCD when you use the zoom. The flash is good considering the price of this camera, though you can only set it to on, off, or auto. The LCD is awesome, but it does deystroy your batteries. 

<b>ACCESSORIES</b>

Though the camera itself is inexpensive, expect to pay about $50 - $100 more on accessories. An absolute must for this camera is a flash memory card, which will allow you to take hundreds to thousands of pictures (depending on the capacity of the card you buy), and a card reader. Without these things, it takes about 15 minutes to upload 20 pics (the maximum good quality pictures you can take without the flash card) to your computer. With the card and reader, you can take 350 pictures on better quality (with a 32mb card) and upload them all in about 45 seconds to your computer. I would recommend buying the card reader and card from Ebay though, as buying these in stores will run you about $30 for the reader and $40 for a 32mb flash card. On ebay, you can get both for about $30.

A small carry case for your camera is a must if you use it outdoors or on the go. I got a REALLY nice super padded and compact one that fits perfect from WALMART for about $8.00.

Rechargeable batteries and recharger are A MUST. I spent $40 for 8 rechargeable batteries and a charger at RadioShack, a mistake considering that you could get that on ebay for about $15, but I don't regret it because I couldn't wait a week plus for batteries, and in the end it was more cost efficient considering all the items I have that use AA and AAA. 

</b>TO SUM IT UP</b>

I love this camera. I have taken hundreds of pictures with it (172 mb worth to be exact). I have used it to make stop motion films, at special events, or just on an exciting day at school. All of my friends love to use my camera when they are over, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great camera for a low price to have fun with.
