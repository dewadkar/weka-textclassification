            It was love at first sight. We bought this car the first week it came out last summer '98. It looks nice, elegant interior, smooth ride, nice acceleration and so on. However, after what I experienced the first few months, I will never buy a Galant again. I noticed with some of the epinions that this car got a bad transmission. Well, the second day I drove this brand new car, the transmission fluid leaked. The dealer Mitsubishi mechanic doesn't know what was wrong. He consulted the Mitsubishi Regional Manager so they decided to replace the whole transmission. WHAT !!! Brand new car with a replaced transmission. I was very disappointed. You know the feeling of driving a new car compare to a new but repaired car. I thought it was a waste of investment on my part coz the problems kept coming up. The next one was the random or squeaking annoying high pitch noise coming from the passenger door that until now, every time I hear it the more I hate Mitsubishi. They don't know what is wrong. The rear windshield and right headlight molding came off already. The air con vents knob and cable has been repaired and replaced twice already. The tires is making a loud noise when turning. They told me it was a tire problem not Mitsubishi but still. Sometimes I think this car is a lemon. 

I had more problems with this car in the first few months than the Toyota Corolla I owned for 10 years. 

And lastly, did you guys hear about the recall for the 1999 model. Go to http://www.autobytel.com to find out more about the recall.

I will review more epinions to see if there is a trend about the problems of this car. I hope we dissatisfied customer can write a letter about these problems.
