            As the title implies, fifteen years ago I purchased a cute little black car.  I was a single mother of one, and I figured I only needed a two-seater.  Although it was a budgetary stretch, I also figured I'd have it forever.  240,000+ miles later, I was not too far off on that estimate!  I had it until last month when it was totalled by a lady who ran a red light.  (Don't worry:  she was fine and I had just a couple of small bruises.)  Although I had seen the new Spyder, I had no intention of buying one until replacement transportation became a necessity.

It is now common knowledge that the supply of Spyders barely exceeds their size (very small).  But they are worth having if you can grab one.  Some dealers are asking $5000 and more over MSRP.  Don't deal with those dealers!  There are many reputable Toyota dealers who want your business and provide good customer service to get it.  They will be willing to go to the extra effort of setting up a trade to get the car you want.  You may need to be flexible on color.  I have white ... I just don't DO little red sports cars!

The Spyder includes as standard electric windows and locks, security system, and locking gas, engine, and storage compartments.  The passenger airbag can be turned off.  The stereo AM/FM/CD/tape player is excellent.  If there is any problem with radio reception, I suggest adjustment to the antenna.  Although this sounds silly, I really mean it.  I kept my old one fairly short until just a few months ago, and found that by adjusting it I picked up a whole new range of stations.  (DUH!)  The clarity and crispness of sound is excellent.  I am listening to the same old CD's picking up whole new strains and strings.

The seats are very comfortable.  As I alluded to above, you may have to "shop" for a dealer.  For expediency, we went out of town.  My husband and I took the kids and made a road trip of it.  We drove 300 miles over and I drove 300 miles back in my new car.   I chased the sunset across the plains and over the mountains, and it was a glorious ride!  And yes, please note, I did remarry and have two MORE children ... and I still bought an MR2.  (Obviously, this is not our ONLY Toyota.)  I found the seats to be extremely accommodating on that trip.  As with all little roadsters, it's a step down to get in, so I won't pretend that's the easiest part.  But you can play with the adjustments a bit to find a setting that works best for both getting in and out, and driving.

The engine is an economical 4-cylinder, but it's a nice 140-hp.  I wouldn't trust myself to have any more horsepower in this little car.  I have to remind myself not to accelerate going uphill just for the fun of it!  I'm getting 30 mpg city and 35 mpg on the highway.  (This is the same mileage I got for years and years in my first MR2.)

As for handling, it turns on a dime and corners like a dream.  It hugs the road and maneuvers well in traffic.  I don't weave and bob, but if someone cuts in front of you or pulls out in front of you, the handling is there for you to use and recover.

Looks?  When I pulled up at my friend's house, she came running out, waving her hands, oohing and ahhing.  "It's kind of got that Boxster/Mazeratti thing going on!" she said.  I'm not sure what she meant with the latter reference, but she's a car lover extraordinaire, so I'm going to go with that assessment.  Stuck in traffic the other day, each lane advancing, then waning, a fellow in a black Z3 beside me craned his neck each and every time he went past.  So much so I was tempted to toss over to him a business car for my chiropractor.  

The little details are just that ... little.  But entertaining.  The floor mats have a 'hook' so they don't scoot.  There's a cup holder between the seats and two more below the stereo.  There's a glove box, and a console in the center of the dash.  The odometer has regular display mode and two trip mileage trackers.  I still have to read the manual to figure out how to use them.  There's only one button to push, so it can't be too tough ... I just haven't done it yet.

As you can see, I am as much in love with my new MR2 as I was 15 years ago.  I hope this one takes me just as far as the old one.  I know it's going to be just as much fun!
