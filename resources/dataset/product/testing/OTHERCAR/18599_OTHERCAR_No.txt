            I bought my Olds Alero GLS back in February of 2000, in more of a hurry than I usually would, when my faithful '88 Integra's engine became sculpture one day on the way to work. (A tip to Honda and Acura owners: use a reputable mechanic who'll tell you the TRUTH about replacing your timing belt.)

My previous cars were a Chevy Cavalier, a Toyota Camry and the aforementioned sculpture; I've also driven (as loaners and rentals) a range of cars from high-end Mercedes to a Geo Metro.

I found the Alero at an Enterprise Rent-A-Car fleet sales place; a higher-end model than they carry in their fleet, I was told it was the former corporate ride of one of their managers. At the time it had about 26000 miles on it. A model that'd sticker at almost $22000 new, they were asking $14000 and selling it with an as-new warranty.

Compared to other cars I could get at the price, it was a clear winner: more powerful, better-handling and more comfortable. The closest competition was the Nissan Altima, but it fell a bit short on all the above. (This was the year before the recent total redesign of that model.) A friend who worked for GM pointed out to me that the Alero was designed with a very specific focus: to go head-to-head with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry and win in every specification, and it would have achieved this had not Honda introduced a more powerful Accord shortly after GM brought out the Alero.

So now I've owned it for a few years, and it's simply the best car I've ever owned. I'm a driver who likes a car that handles well - I kept the Integra so long because it reminded me of riding a motorcycle - and the Alero works beautifully. You *do* need to adjust to the GM-vague power steering, but once you get a feel for it you can make this car do amazing things. It flat outhandles any front-wheel drive car I've ever driven. The V6 engine isn't the refined, near silent appliance the Japanese makers put under their hoods; it makes itself heard if you put your foot down. But it's a note of authority, not complaint, and it has torque enough to surprise even those used to engines with more horsepower.

The cabin is quite comfortable for me. Leather seats were a nice plus at the price I paid, and the seats fit me and most guests well, though a few of my largest friends have looked a tiny bit cramped. While it's billed as a five-seater, that's not something you want to try; the middle-rear seat is a thinly-padded torture device best left unoccupied. The other two rear seats are comfortable for short people, but put tall friends in the front or they'll feel like they're sitting in a hole. As is usual for GM, the heater and air conditioner are among the most effective around. The standard sound system, while good, isn't going to wow any audiophiles; but it plays tapes, CD's and radio clearly and strongly enough to entertain anyone who's not trying to share their experience with the whole neighborhood, and between its being GM-issue and having a theft-deterrent feature no one's likely to break into the car to steal it.

What nits can I pick? Gas mileage around town is less than stellar: I average about 17MPG, and have had it drop as low as 13. On the highway, on the other hand, I've come close to 40 and average about 30. I had one major mechanical problem early on -- clogged injectors leading to the temporary loss of one piston -- apparently caused by the driver before me using cheap gas and not following the proper maintenance schedule. The brakes work very well, but the rotors tend to warp slightly -- not enough to hurt performance, or to cause any pulsing through the pedal, but just enough to make them go "shoop-shoop-shoop" in low-speed turns.

Overall, despite its imperfections, this is the best car I've owned and one of the best I've ever driven. I have one last, and very serious complaint: GM's decision to drop the Oldsmobile brand name altogether means that I (and all the other Olds owners) am now an orphan. It puts the resale value down there with used chewing gum despite the car's good qualities, and means that if I choose to keep the car I can look forward to little or no support from GM a few years down the line. This is a stinking, lousy way to treat their customers, not to mention what a crying shame it is to get rid of America's oldest car brand just when it looked like they'd finally started to make it work again.
