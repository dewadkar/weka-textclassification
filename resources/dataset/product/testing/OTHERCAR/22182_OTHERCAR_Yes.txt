            Your first digital camera is a big purchase.  You want something that's easy to use, that's for sure.  Of course, we all want high quality.  And, while you'll probably buy a more advanced camera down the line, you don't want something you'll have to throw away in six months.  Low price is a good idea too, especially if you're not sure the 'digital revolution' is for you.

Enter the Kodak DC3400 Zoom.  It has everything the beginner needs, and almost seems to be designed for the first time buyer.  It also slots nicely under $300, a deal when considering the features and quality included.

The first 'stat' most look at when considering a digital camera is the resolution, in megapixels.  The DC3400 is a 2.0 megapixel camera, which is basically the bottom of the high end on current cameras.  There are some other cameras in this price range that have 2.3 or even up to 3.0 megapixels, however for the beginner the quality difference won't be immediately noticeable and the other aspects of the Kodak more than make up for this.  In any case, this camera can take pictures up to 1760 x 1168 pixels; plenty big enough to make large prints.

The zoom options are another important consideration when buying a camera.  The Kodak has a 2x optical zoom and a 3x digital zoom.  Because a digital zoom does essentially the same thing as blowing up your pictures in your photoediting software, with the corresponding quality loss, optical zoom is the real marker of quality.  Optical zoom is something that is missing on some of the DC3400's direct competition.

This camera also has a host of other features, many of them great for the beginner.  These include 3 image quality and 2 image resolution settings, picture timer, red eye reduction flash, USB interface, an active LCD screen, extreme closeup mode, and much more.  Advanced users will also be able to take advantage of white balance, exposure, metering, and ISO settings.

The DC3400 uses CompactFlash memory, and an 8MB card is included.  This is not a large amount of memory, but is enough to take about 30-40 images of decent quality at a time.  A larger memory card is highly recommended, and since this camera does not use a proprietary memory system like many others, this isn't too expensive.

If you can't afford a new memory card right away, don't fret; the DC3400 has six different quality settings, and pictures taken under each of them take up different amounts memory.  The three quality settings - Good, Better, and Best - control the compression of the images.  Better is fine for average snapshots, but Best takes very clear, sharp images.  Good is fine for just shooting around and getting used to the camera, as the loss of quality due to compression shows.

In addition to the compression setting, the resolution can either be set at high (1760 x 1168) and standard (896 x 592).  High is good for large prints, and captures truly massive images (consider that if your monitor settings are at a resolution of 1024 x 768, the picture will be larger than your screen!), and standard is perfect for smaller prints, up to 5x7", or most any snapshots.  Setting the camera at high resolution and best quality produces stunning photos, the quality of which will surely exceed most printers you will be using to fix the image.  If you're curious and would like to see a comparison of all six modes, just email me.

All of the controls on the camera are easy to use.  There are  only a few buttons on the camera, inlcuding the zoom controls, shutter button, and buttons to control flash, distance settings, and picture timer.  All advanced features are accessed through the LCD menu, which is simple to navigate.  The menu is easy to scroll through and each selection is easily identified.  The LCD is also backlit so it's easy to see.

Included is a nice rubber lenscover, a USB cable with serial adapter, 4 batteries, and the 8MB CompactFlash card.  What it <b>doesn't</b> include are rechargeable batteries, an AC adapter, or a carrying case.  Unfortunately, you'll need to spring for these, but then again most cameras in this range don't include these anyway.  An AC adapter or seperate card reader is highly recommended, as transferring files eats away at battery life.

It's pretty rugged too; the areas you hold are rubberized, making it harder to drop, and it comes with a wrist strap.  I haven't dropped it yet, but it feels like it can take some minor shocks and survive, and Kodak has great customer service in case of an accident.  I've had this camera for 9 months and take it everywhere with me, and haven't had any problems.

Unless you use a seperate card reader, you will need to install software.  However, this software is easy to use and set up, and it's easy to transfer files using it.  Once the camera is connected, you can access it from My Computer just like any other folder or drive.  USB transfer is pretty fast, but again, a card reader will be somewhat faster.

This camera has some nice features to play with, like black & white and sepia tone capturing, an extreme close-up feature which lets you take images between 0.8-1.6 feet away, and timestamp and border effects.  Advanced users can set exposure form +2.0 to -2.0, select from center-weighted or multi-pattern metering, and turn auto ISO on or off.  Higher-end features, specifically shutter speed selection and a bulb setting for time-lapse photography, are absent, and are the only things I personally miss.  However, these are not common on cameras under $300.  There is a lens adapter available from Kodak that provides for filters and other lenses to be attached to the camera.

Overall, this camera is the perfect entry point.  It offers plenty of features for the beginner, while offering some advanced features to play with once you've got the basics down.  I generally take snapshots for my personal collection and to share with friends, as well as pictures for the web, and this camera works beautifully.  For the money, it's hard to beat this camera, and even if you move up later on, it can provide you with great pictures for years to come.
