            WE bought the Pathfinder to handle our increasing amount of cargo we were carrying around and the price was right. Nice and roomy, one of the many trucks we test drove, this one seemed to be the best for our buck and our mechanic said it was in excellent shape! 
Took a long road trip from NY to SC and the CD got stuck and we had to listen to the PETSHOP BOYs for 10 hours, we could not eject nor stop the CD player, if we hit the FM button to get the radio we would get 10 seconds of FM and then the CD would start again! It was like driving 'CHRISTINE&quot;. Then a week later- the brake light goes on whenever we step on the gas peddle. (yeah that makes sense!) We are getting up nice and early tomorrow to get it looked at.
