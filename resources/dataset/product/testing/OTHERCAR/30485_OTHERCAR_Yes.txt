            I am a proud owner of this new car. I purchased this vehicle with honor. I found that I do love this car. I test drove 4 other types of cars that where in the same price range. I was very happy with very happy that the car is a 1.8 litre twin cam, 16 valve, 125 horse power. I do like how she handles in snow too. A very good front wheel driven car. I love the extra power that Toyota has put into there new engine design. The car has that extra kick when you need it, she is great at passing cars when needed. The brakes are well designed. The interior size of the car is well fit, allowing plenty of space for driver and passengers, and for trunk space lots of that too. What is it that make me like to drive this car, well lets just say that I like the feel of the car when driving, I like how she is good at cornering and I also like the fact that the car it very quiet inside too. I do highly recommend this car to all. This car also with a few modifications would be a very good touring car for racing on some circuit race courses. For all of you others already into touring, you know
what mods will need to be done ;). Please try this car before you buy another, as you will either love like I did or whatever on it....peace.<br><br>
