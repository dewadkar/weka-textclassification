            I don't really keep up with the latest in sports cars, so I usually wouldn't write an opinion about a topic like this. If you're looking for really technical details, check out some of the other opinions; here I just give some general details about the car. My friend recently purchased an Audi TT about three weeks ago.  She went through quite an ordeal to get one since they are not easy to come by, so the more she told me about the car, the more piqued my interest became.  I finally got a chance to see her much talked about vehicle this weekend and went on a two hour drive with her, so I thought I'd share my impression of the car.

<b>Appearance</b>
The Audi TT is a great looking car. This one was a sporty red. I had never seen a car before that had an interior style theme as this car does.  My friend said that this is because the Audi TT was introduced first as a concept car.  The car from the outside is very cute looking. It is very rounded, similar to the new VW bugs.  The car is designed in an art deco scheme. The gas cap, which was located on the back right side of the car, matches the interior details of brushed metal with raised dots on it.  The interior of the car really makes it fun to be in. Everything was black and silver and in the art deco style, from the door handles to the stick shift and the dashboard displays. When not in use, the radio hides behind a shiny metal cover, which lifts up when touched to reveal the stereo (hers was a BOSE).  The leather interior is very comfortable. The car seats two in style. The back seats are pretty little so if you need a car to regularly transport more than 2 passengers, unless they are little kids, this car won't be practical for you. But then again, one wouldn't really buy this car for practical purposes. The windows are little and round, and the seats are pretty low down, but you get used to this quickly.

<b>Fun Details</b>
The Audi TT has a few other fun tricks to offer. At the push of a button, not only does water squirt onto the front window, but two squirters also come out from underneath the front headlights, aim at the lights, squirt them with water, and then retreat back into the car. This will definitely impress your friends and people passing by. The display for the speed, milage, and gas have some neat extras, an electronic display that gives you extra information like how many miles you have left to drive before you'll need to refill the tank, etc. The car interior can be temperature controlled; you just set what you want the temperature to be.

<b>But what about the car itself - how does it drive?</b>
So like I said, I'm not a sports car expert. I felt that the drive was very smooth. We made some really fast turns with perfect ease, and I could definitely feel that this car handled the road really well, at least compared to the cars I experience on an every day basis.  My friend raves about driving this car, with its 6 gears, and she loves to be a speed demon. 

My friend paid $40,000 for her Audi TT, and so far she is more than satisfied. Maybe it depends on where you are, but since there aren't tons of these cars out there people will stare and stop to check out your car, which I guess is a plus if you like to impress people or a con if you would find the attention annoying. But it certainly is a unique car so if you have a chance to check one out or go on a test drive definitely enjoy the opportunity.<br><br>
