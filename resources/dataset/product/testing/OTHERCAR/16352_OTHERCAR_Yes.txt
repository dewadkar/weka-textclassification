            We bought this camera on a very impulsive, spur-of-the-moment decision.  We'd gone in an office supply store to get paper, and spotted the HP 200 on sale for $299 and since we'd been thinking about getting one, just grabbed it!
It was a good decision, though we've since decided we need more features.  But for a first digital, it's been an overall good buy.  Instead of using diskettes to store pictures, it has a Flash card that can hold up to 100 low-res pictures (what we normally take) and has three resolutions.  The only problem with the Flash card has been uploading the pictures to the computers via serial cable; when my Windows serial ports went on the fritz, we were not able to use his Macintosh to get them and had to wait until my computer was fixed.  
The 2x zoom feature works nicely, though it sometimes causes blurry photos if the camera isn't held very steady, such as on a tripod or on a railing.  The flash has red-eye reduction which works well, but taking pictures at a distance in the dark often causes the bottom half of the photo to be dark.
Overall, I would recommend this as a first digital camera, but not to more advanced photographers.
