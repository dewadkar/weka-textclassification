            It's not often that I start off my epinions with negative information, but for a little camera like this.. this thing really, and I mean really eats batteries!

I've used a LOT of different cameras in my lifetime, and out of all of them this one kills batteries the fastest.  It's a shame they don't have a small adapter where you can carry a car battery in a pouch on your hip!  Then you MIGHT have the power to run this thing!

For the features though, this is an excellent camera for the money, starting off a few years ago, a decent digital camera would run you more than $1,000.  Today, getting this one for less than half that amount, and able to get HIGH RESOLUTION pictures ten times better than just a few years ago is amazing!

With cameras like this one out there, I'm just waiting for the old 35mm's to start really disappearing off the market so fast that it'll be hard to find film for them!

But there's always the disposeables right?   ;)

If you decide to purchase this camera, I would highly recommend getting a charger for it as well... Get yourself a set of NiCad batteries that fit this thing and a charger and you'll be all set!

I've used mine for about 3 months now, I have one other digital camera, it's an olympus and I'd say for the money, this one was the better deal but then again, I bought the other one over a year ago, and we all know what technology is like, one year after the other.

The Canon Power Shot takes excellent photos and if you get yours with a kit like I did, you'll have software for editing the photos you take as well.  The zoom feature is something you'll find handy, you just need to get it in your mind that in order to get closer, you don't have to actually walk there... just hit the button!!
