            For my last birthday, my husband Mike totally surprised me and got me a digital camera.  I�d been researching them for quite a while, trying to figure out which one to buy, and had decided that a $99 job would do the trick.  Mike got me the Olympus D-490.  And while it�s a bit more than $99, it�s worth every penny.

The first thing I noticed about the camera was its attractive appearance. It�s not one of those bulky digitals that come in two parts and require weight training to use.  It�s lightweight and comfortable to hold.  It comes with an 8MB memory card, 2 lithium batteries that lasted for 200 shots, serial cables for pc and mac, NTSC video output cable, a strap, instruction manuals in English, French, and Spanish, and Camedia software.  The English instruction manual is well written and well illustrated, making it easy to get acquainted with the camera.

The Olympus D-490 is a 2.1 megapixel camera capable of 1600x1200 resolution in the HQ (high quality) and SHQ (super high quality) modes. With the 8MB card that comes with the camera, you can shoot 5 SHQ or 16 HQ shots before downloading. The higher the resolution, the longer it takes to download each image. It takes me about 7 minutes to download 5 SHQ shots into my Presario 5452.  You can also shoot in SQ (standard quality) at 640x480 resolution, which will give you 82 shots on an 8MB card, or SQ-High, which gives you 32 shots. Use these last two settings for drafts only � to check out the layout of a still-life, for example.  If you shoot the family reunion in standard quality, get ready for disappointment. In the photo editing software, a standard quality picture breaks down into pixels with the first crop, making it very difficult to edit the image.

The camera has a 3x optical zoom, plus a 2.5x digital telephoto.  You can use these in combination for a 7.5x maximum zoom, but the digital telephoto seems to degrade the picture quality a bit.  It has an optical viewfinder and a 1.8-inch monitor, which really sucks the life out of batteries, especially the non-lithium type. I recommend using the monitor only to edit the photos you�ve taken � don�t use it as a viewfinder unless you own stock in Duracell.    

The control panel on the top of the camera will display all the info you need; what picture quality mode you�re in, how many shots remaining, white balance, ISO setting, flash status, and battery life.  If the white balance is set for something other than auto, WB appears in the control panel. If the light sensitivity is set for something other than auto, ISO appears on the control panel.  It won�t tell you what the ISO or WB setting is � you�ll have to go into the shooting menu to find that information.  All settings return to the default when you turn the camera off.  If you want to keep settings, go to page 2 of the shooting menu, enter the Reset option, then enter hold.

This camera also has a nice feature that allows you to shoot a 23 second video in the HQ (320x240) mode, and 104 seconds in the SQ (160x120) mode. You can also create panoramic shots, though Olympus says this feature is only available if you use their name brand media cards and the Camedia software.  There is a sequential shot mode, which is good for fast action at the race track or fly-in � one of the shots has got to come out right!  

Obviously the test for any camera is what kind of pictures it takes and the Olympus D-490 does not disappoint.  I took a HQ picture of a stellar jay in mid-flight from 20 feet.  After cropping and zooming, I could see the bird�s right eye was closed and its feet curled up.  The color of the bird was very accurate.  A close-up SHQ shot of Fraiser, my Himalayan, showed individual hairs clearly defined and incredible detail in his blue eyes (there�s a special Macro mode for shots from 8 � 31 inches from the subject).  Even in the SQ mode, the pictures from a car show were great, with beautiful, accurate color.  

My minor gripe:  1. To turn it on and off, you slide the lens cover just up to, but not quite touching, the lens.  This is takes some getting used to, and I usually bump the lens, slide the cover back to compensate and end up turning the camera on again.  Or I close the cover and hear the lens trying to deploy inside the cover. 

In a Nutshell:  the picture quality of this camera is great and the colors are very accurate and life-like.  It has a wide range of options available on the shooting menu that make it adaptable to most situations. I highly recommend the Olympus D-490 to anyone in the market for a digital camera.
