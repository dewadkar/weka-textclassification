            I'm intentionally leaving out all the stuff about the engine and the horsepower because you can read about that anywhere you read about the car.  Since, I'm a woman I'll talk about the characteristics that attracted me to the car. I bought this car about two month's ago.  I had been looking for the perfect sports car that would replace my love of the Nissan 300zx.  Actually, I don't think anything will replace it.  

Why Buy It?
I bought this car because of the brand name, good price $33,900, and of course sex appeal.  I have the black with black leather interior. I had compared this car with the BMW Z3, Toyota Spider and Audi TT.  The S2000 has the look of a BMW and a Porshe minus the price.  However you can purchase the BMW z3 for around the same price if you want to go name brand.  Since there are only a few hundred s2000s in America, this is the better car to go with.  People are amazed at the car because they've never seen anything like it.  I've had people tell me they thought it was a BMW or a Porshe.  It redlines at 9rpms which means you can drive this car real fast.  I've done over 120mph. The ac and stereo controls are in perfect reaching distance from the driver.  You can have your hands on the wheel while adjusting these controls.  There actually is a lot of foot room.  I've had friends who are over 6 feet tall praise the leg room.  The trunk space is fairly decent.  You can carry a set of golf clubs in it.

A Disadvantage?
This car wasn't designed for a 5'4" woman. I barely reach the clutch, break, and pedal.  I usually try to wear thick shoes.  That helps. I was surprised with the simplicity of the interior.  The cd/stereo is hidden by a black cover and the paneling is plain.  My friends tell me I shouldn't expect much considering it's a sports car.  But I've seen the interior of the BMW z3 and it's fancier.  In addition, it doesn't have power seats.  Also the back window is plastic which means it gets dirty fast, fogs up quickly, and it's hard to see out of.  Another major disadvantage is when you are turning it is difficult to see oncoming cars because the soft top blocks a lot of the driver's vision. On my way to Corpus Christi, TX from Houston, TX I drove through a major rain storm.  On a 70mph highway I had to drive 35mph while trucks and vans passed me.  Sure it has great handling but in a major rain storm it was hard to keep this little car in its place. There's no room for pets.  I have a rabbit and two birds so when I want to visit my out of town parents for an extended period of time, I can't.  They have to come see me since I can't transport the animals with their cages. Lastly, of course there is more road noise in this car than the average vehicle because it has a soft top. But it's a convertible so who cares?

Standards?
Stereo/Cd player, power windows and doors, manual transmission 6 gears, driver side air bag, 3 small storage compartments to driver's right, and one to the left of passenger's feet

Options?
I don't know if there were any options on this car.  The dealership didn't offer me any and doing my homework the only thing I found was you can purchase a hard top.  It runs for a couple of thousand dollars and you need two people to put it on and take it off.

Advice?
Know what you want in a sport's car.  Since you usually are placed on a waiting list for a sports car call around and make sure you can get a test drive.  Some dealerships won't let you because they only have one or two in stock at any time.  I went to a dealership that had 3 yellow S2000s because no one wanted them and I test drove one.

Make sure you bargain.  Dealers try to make you feel that since this car is rarely in stock that you have to pay lots over sticker.  I only paid $1000 over msrp and the seller threw in tinted windows for free.  He actually had the car stickered at $38,000.  I persuaded him to match the price I got from the other dealer for the yellow.
