            I was drawn to the ML320 for its refinement, utility, 4wd and Mercedes' legendary reputation for quality.  I got 2 out of 4.

This is the 3rd SUV I've owned, following a 1996 Honda Passport and a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Clearly the most expensive is the Mercedes, however, if you are accustomed to Mercedes Sedan luxury, you will be disappointed with the ML. 

The ride is firm as expected, but the additional height of the ML gives the ride a bouncy quality on rough pavement.  Cornering results in significant lean to the point of  dislodging rear passengers with any speed.  The lateral supports on the front seats are insufficient to keep the driver in his place.

The biggest disappointment has come in the form of minor defects that keep plaguing the vehicle:  headliner and trim around the sunroof kept dropping down (the dealer finally glued the liner in place);  all of the electric window switches were replaced; door insulation made contact with window glass and left a sap-like coating that required a dealer repair; the mounting location for the Mercedes installed phone power supply (under the glove box) is incapable of supporting the weight and the panel has dropped down on several occassions; an exterior trim piece cracked for no appparent reason; the glove box was replaced due to faulty hinges; the dealer installed headliner mounted television frequently shorts out; and lastly the cigarette lighter fuse is incapable of supporting a plug-in cell phone charger.

On the positive side, the engine, transmission and 4 WD are all silky smooth.  The vehicle would be a complete disappointment were it not for the mechanicals.  

Options I Like: Navigation (expensive but very accurate); Bose stereo and disc changer.

Options I would not recommend:  Mercedes phone that integrates through the radio (very expensive and the hands-free mic pick up is very poor); dealer installed TV and VCR (2-3 times as expensive as portable DVD player, constantly shorting out, and access to the VCR under the rear seat is HORRIBLE to the point of being comical).
