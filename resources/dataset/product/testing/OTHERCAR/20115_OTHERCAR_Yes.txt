            The reason I have purchased this vehicle, is because of the smoothness of the ride and the luxury that comes with it.  The things that I love about this vehicle, is that it handles well, it's worth every penny, every time you drive it you feel like a whole new person.  The things that I dislike about this car are the petals, and the trunk space.  I definitly wish that this car had more trunk space because of all the supplies that I carry, and if it did have more trunk space, that would mean less trips back and forth.  When you get in and drive this automobile, you feel like you have acheived a higher status and have a feeling that your on top of the world.  Youshould buy this vehicle if you need to get out and drive for a little while by yourself.  You will feel a whole lot better driving this car, and if your a person that needs to do that a lot then this is just the car for you.  This is more like a car to just relax in.  If you like fast cars and foot to the floor gas petals then this is definitly not the car for you.  If you like a little more trunk space then usual this isn't the car for you.<br><br>
