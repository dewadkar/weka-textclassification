            I needed a new car fast. I looked the Honda Accord,which like most other Import Sedans (BMW exluded)does not come with a V6 - 5 speed combo.I bought a black Max SE (5 speed, leather, sun room, Boze, climate control) off the show room floor for under 23,500 out the door. After owning muscle cars when younger I am extermely happy with the performance (both engine and handling) of this car. I invested a few bucks in upgrading to the Stillen short throw shifter and putting on a K&amp;N intake from Stillen which were both great performance investments. The growl alone under fast excelleration makes this car really fun to drive. Although I am not a kid anymore these few improvement really boost the fun in driving an already fun to drive car. I am contemplating investing in sway bars to beef up the suspension abit. The only problem I had, while these engines have an excellent reliability reputation, Igot one where the rings were put on wrong on one cylinder and had to be fixed. The service manager at my dealership is a friend and took care of it (no cost to me) and said this was a first and that i had nothing more to worry about. Since the repair the symptoms of oil usage are gone.I contemplated buying a BMW 328, but the size, performanceand sticker price could not justify a change.<br><br>
