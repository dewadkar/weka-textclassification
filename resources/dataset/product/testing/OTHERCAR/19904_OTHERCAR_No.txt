            Is it just me, or is this the weirdest looking mutt of the Jumbo-SUV bunch?  Given the price tag, I suppose you'd expect an extraordinary body design - because there's certainly nothing special under the hood.  Yet the overall design leaves me suspecting substance abuse on the part of the drafting department.  I can't say I actually despise this machine, like I despise the Merd-cedes faux SUV, or that I think it's excessive and pretentious like the Lincoln Navigator, but something just bugs me about it nonetheless.  For all the vast quantities of metal and plastic employed in this vehicle, you'd expect more cargo space - or at least a set of back doors that you can actually load stuff into and out of - but I guess this is just a people and dogs machine.  For practical use, I'd stick to the regular Ford &amp; Chevy products.<br><br>
