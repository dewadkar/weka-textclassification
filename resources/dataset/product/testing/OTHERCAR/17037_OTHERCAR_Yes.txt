            I bought this car to replace my old Grand Cherokee (see my review of that) and I have been quite pleased with it.  I commute into Boston everyday from New Hampshire and the Durango is equally adept at handling the twisting country roads of NH and the rush hour traffic of Boston.  The 4WD is easy to engage but it cuts your fuel economy by at least 5 mpg.  If there was one thing I could change about the Durango it would be the fuel economy.  It's mediocre at best when you watch your speed, but at 75 mph, the gauge takes a freefall.  

Despite all the fuel it uses, I wouldn't rate its performance very highly.  It's got power to pull you out of a sticky situation, but don't try to beat the little red sports car next to you at red lights!  Mine tips the scales at 6500 lbs making it a tad sluggish.  If you like to play king of the intersection, the Durango is probably not for you!  Despite that, I would certainly buy another one.  I have driven it around 40,000 miles in the last 3 months and, besides oil changes, it has required absolutely no service.  After the shaky reliability of the Grand Cherokee, it's nice to know that I have a car that I can hop in and drive across country on a whim (it's happened).  

I recommend the leather seats (somehow the seats get much more comfy with the leather option than the cloth) and the rear a/c.  I didn't get the rear air and I regret it every hot day (I live in NH, doesn't happen a whole lot).  I also recommend a light color.  I got a black one and everytime I go to the mall or Walmart or someplace I end up with a scratch that is very noticeable on a vehicle of this size.  Don't get the third seat unless you have small children (their the only one's that fit back there.
