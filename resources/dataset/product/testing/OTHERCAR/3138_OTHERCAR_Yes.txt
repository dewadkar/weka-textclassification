            We researched this car throughly before we bought it and feel that we got the best deal as well as the best car we could have found for the money. 
The car rides well, handles well, has enough horsepower to get us down the road, is roomy for a compact, and the gas mileage is excellent! 
There are features for a young family with it's child proof safety locks on the back doors and the anchors for child seats in the rear. The Hyundai Elantra is not meant for a young driver that wants a hot rod.
We've had ours for going on three weeks now and only have one complaint - the drivers seat belt gets twisted and stuck sometimes. For the price you can't get a better car! I highly recommend it. <br><br>
