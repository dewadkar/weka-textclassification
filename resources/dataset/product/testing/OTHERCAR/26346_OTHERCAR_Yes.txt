            For those looking to make a transition from 35mm cameras to digital pictures, this camera provides a phenomenol medium for this change.

I made my decision to switch to digital prints after I got back 5 rolls of vacation photos - all terrible due to a malfunctioning camera.  As if this weren't bad enough, I had to pay close to $50 to find this out.

While some cameras may have higher megapixel values or digital/optical zooms, this camera's values (3.2 megapixels, 3x optical, 6x digital) are far more than satisfactory for amateur photographers working on home computers.

The camera itself has several modes: picture taking, picture viewing/reviewing, movies, and setup.

The options available even before taking the pictures allow you to tailor the camera to each individual setting.  The camera defaults to auto-focus, but can also be set manually.  Lighting can be entered into the camera to gauge the flash intensity.  Shutter speed, image size, image quality, flash level, and sharpness can also be adjusted.  The manual provides some information on how to adjust these properly, or you can leave them at default settings and still produce beautiful pictures.

Reviewing pictures on the camera is subject to many options as well: not only can poor pictures be deleted instantaneously, but good pictures can be saved and protected, rotated, or resized.  While these operations can be performed after the pictures have been transferred to your PC, it is sometimes helpful to quickly resize or rotate before this is done.

The movie mode, while without sound, can provide neat little clips for use in emails or on websites.

My favorite feature of this camera is a subset of the movie mode: the multiburst movie option.  In this mode, the camera takes 15 pictures separated by fractions of a second: from 1/7.5 to 1/30 of a second.  

I use this option often when watching my little brother pitch or swing at his baseball games.  Being able to break down his mechanics step by step has been an invaluable tool in improving his game.

There are some problems with the camera, though some can be solved by additional purchases.

The enclosed memory card is only 16MB, which can hold as little as 6 to 7 pictures if you choose higher resolutions and higher qualities.  It is in your best interest to purchase a larger memory card(s).  I bought a 128MB stick, and have almost filled it to its entirety on vacations and trips.  The 128MB stick should cost you between $80 and $90, and there are smaller sticks available.

The battery life can also be an issue.  When using the LCD screen, the battery gets drained very quickly.  Unfortunately, I prefer to review my pictures frequently, and I find myself changing batteries very often.  Luckily, the batteries are rechargeable and you can purchase more for less than $10.

One minor annoyance is the flash prep.  When turning on the flash for a single picture, the camera take more than a second or two to prep the flash.  It may not sound like much, but once you get your family into a group pose and then realize you are flashless, turning it on and having to wait a few seconds can seem like an eternity.

Overall, the DSC-P71 is a great replacement for traditional 35mm cameras.  I highly recommend it and could not imagine getting more for the price I paid.
