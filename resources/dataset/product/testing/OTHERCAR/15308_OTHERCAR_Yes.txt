            Ok this was supposed to be for my husband. This was actually a gift to him from someone but I have claimed it as my new true love.  Hey I will use it a heck of a lot more than he will. 

I fell in love with this camera by just practicing with it for a few days. Taking pictures of the kids and cats so that I could get to know the camera. I must say that I am very impressed with this.  The pictures are crystal clear and it is so easy to use.

When you first open the box here is what you get:
A battery charger, rechargeable battery pack, A/V connecting cable, a shoulder strap, and  lens cap.  Now it does not include the floppy disk so you will have to purchase those seperatly but, they are expensive at all. 

Here are some of the many options that are on this Digital Mavica that I fell in love with.  It has an optical zoom (3X) and a Precision zoom (6X).  It has a movie mode which you can record movement for about 5 seconds. You can show the movie on your PC or send the movie by email.  It also has a Audio Video output so you can enjoy your digital images on a large screen TV. 

It is so easy to use this camera. First thing you need to do is charge the battery which takes 150 minutes for a normal charge.  Then all you need to do is put in your battery and floppy. then shoot away.  there is a built in flash and the zoom is super easy to use by just moving a switch on the right top corner.  There is a LCD back light so you can adjust the back light on your pictures.  You can also adjust your brightness on the digital screen.  there is also a menu button that allows you to view other pictures you have taken or set the self timer. Under the Menu button is also the setup option which allows you to set a certain language and the clock set. under the file option there are options for the image size, recording mode, and the image quality. There is also a button that you set for either automatic focus or manual focus.

This is such an amazing camera and I am learning something new about it everyday.  I admit is is expensive. Although we didn't buy it since it was a gift the price tag on the box says it is $744.00.  That's definatly a lot more than I would spend on a digital camera. But if you are in the market for a great digital camera that takes awesome pictures and money isn't an issue, I would highly recommend the Sony MVC-FD83.<br><br>
