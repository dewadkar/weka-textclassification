            I have long resisted buying a digital camera. I love film and the flexibility and quality that my film camera delivers. However, my wife recently gave me my first digital camera, the Fuji A303. Now, I'm a convert.

I travel a lot. Unfortunately, I find my old film camera a bit bulky. For that reason, I've taken it on fewer and fewer trips. On the other hand, the A303 is so compact, that I take it everywhere. Also, new airport security is brutal on film. I've even had film destroyed by xray even when kept in a lead bag. I've never had a problem with the digital medium.

The A303 is a terrific entry level camera. A quick read of the instruction manual ensures a short learning curve. Once the basics are quickly mastered, the user can begin to explore some of the more advanced features. While other digital cameras can deliver the sophistication of the classic film SLRs, this camera offers enough flexibility for the average snapshot taker.

The quality of the photos is excellent and flexible. To email good photos to friends, use the 0.3 megapixel setting. For 4x6 prints, use the 1 megapixel setting. For better or larger prints, use the 2, 3 Normal, or 3 Fine megapixel settings. The more megapixels, the sharper the image but the more storage space it requires.

This compact camera offers optical and digital zoom. In addition, it allows photographers to take extreme close up shots. Photographers can use either the view finder or the 1.5 inch view screen.

The two downsides of this camera are: 1) the Fuji software does not work seamlessly with Windows 98, 2nd Edition; and 2) the flash often causes red eye, a common problem with all small cameras. Fortunately, the software glitch is easy to work around and the red eye can be edited out on your computer.

There are two downsides to all digital cameras: First, getting quality prints is a bit tricky. To get quality prints that last, you need a specialty printer and the right paper. Alternatively, you can go to some photo shops to printout your photos or upload them to an online service that will print your photos and mail them to you. Second, digital cameras are energy hogs. To save money, buy a good set of NiMH batteries with a recharge kit. Try to get 1800 mAh batteries which will hold a charge longer than the more common 1200 mAh variety.

Just because you spend a fair amount on a new digital camera, your spending won't be finished. As I just mentioned, you'll want to buy some rechargeable batteries. Buy twice as many as you need so you'll always have an extra set with you. Also, you'll want to upgrade your memory card. The camera comes with a 16MB card which holds 12 to 122 photos depending on the megapixel setting. With a $75 128MB card, you can store 102 to 997 photos in your camera.

So, if you're ready to make the switch from film to digital or if you want to switch from your bulky, inflexible old digital, this camera is for you.
