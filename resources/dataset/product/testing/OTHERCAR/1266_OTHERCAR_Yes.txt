            As a professional photographer, I find this little camera somewhat limiting.  However, I'd strongly recommend it to any deep pocketed consumer looking for the latest and greatest digital camera.

I borrowed the camera for a week.  I carried it everywhere -- to studio shoots, and when I was hanging out with friends.  It's a fantastic little camera for the consumer market, but I doubt I'd ever use it in a professional setting.

<b>First, the good stuff:</b>  

*  The 3x optical zoom has a nice range, from a good wide angle to a decently tight telephoto.  
*  The image resolution is fantastic for a digital camera -- you used to have to get slides professionally scanned to get anything close to what the Nikon 990 captures.  
*  Coupled with a photo quality printer, I would certainly consider it to be a film replacement for any snap shooter out there.
*  I was somewhat worried about it being a little flimsy, but my fears were unfounded.  It's a solid little device.
*  Thankfully, it has a fully manual mode and an aperture priority mode, two exposure modes that are a god-send for professional and serious amature photographers.
*  The camera also has Nikon's great matrix metering system.

<b>Now, the not so great stuff:</b>

*  Lack of lenses.  The selection just doesn't cut it in the professional world, although it matches most point-and-shoot cameras just fine.
*  High resolution images means lots of storage space. For the supplied memory card to be useful, you have to shoot in a low resolution mode.  A 98MB flash card will set you back a few hundred dollars more, but it's well worth the convenience of being able to store more high quality images.
*  The viewing screen is terrible.  I don't like looking at LCDs, and the provided optical viewfinder is less than convenient.
* Expensive!  After you're done buying a good digital set-up (the camera, a printer, and more memory), you could have bought a truly professional 35mm camera system.

In conclusion, I'd give it four points for consumers -- it would be five, but it really is an expensive little beast.

I'm not going to rate it for professional photographers.  It just doesn't fit the market.
