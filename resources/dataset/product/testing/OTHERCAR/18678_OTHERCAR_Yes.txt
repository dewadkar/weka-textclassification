            � My experience using this product.
  SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY
  Out of the box, the Sony MVC-FD92 was simple to use.  After a short charge of the battery, I was immediately outside taking pictures.  The menus system is easy to navigate and straight-forward.  Basic and advanced features are only a toggle-button away.

� Why I bought this product.
  BRAND NAME
  I've always been pleased with the quality of Sony products (see my review on the KV27FV-15 at <a href='/elec-Televisions_SonyKV-FF-Sony_KV-27FV15/tk_~CB005.1.7'>http://www.epinions.com/elec-Televisions_SonyKV-FF-Sony_KV-27FV15/tk_~CB005.1.7</a>).

  VERSATILITY
  For storage, the MVC-FD92 uses both smart media and floppy disk or a combination of either.  I can copy pictures to or from either format.  With the floppy disk format, I can quickly access my images from any computer- no special cables or ports necessary.  Or, with an add-on floppy disk adapter, you can still enjoy the capacity of the smart media via a special disk that the smart media fits into.  Special software on the PC then reads the smart media card through the special disk as though it were a regular floppy disk.  Or a direct USB connection is available as well.

  FEATURES
  The FD92 is a great digital camera and a great mini-camcorder as well.  In VIDEO mode, the camera can capture both audio and video.  The length of the video is dependent upon the capacity of your storage media.  I've captured at least 5 minutes of video on the 32MB card I have.
  Image quality at all resolutions is clear, crisp, and well-defined.  There are built-in enhancements (black and white, sepia, negative, etc.) that can be applied as well.
  There are lots of options for focus, setting, and zoom- so many in fact I'm not sure I'll ever use them all.  nice to know they are there though.
  You can also purchase additional lenses that can be attached to the FD92 giving you an even greater range of flexibility in photo formats.

� What do you love about this product?
  DUAL-MEDIA FORMAT
  Of all the features this camera offers, perhaps the most enjoyable is the dual-media format.  Taking pictures with the floppy disk is essentially no different than using the smart media card.  You can use the camera to format the disk if necessary (a very quick operation) and saving pictures to disk is faster than expected.
  The rechargeable battery life is measured in minutes (usually 120 minutes on a full charge).  I've taken hundreds of photos and videos without draining it completely.  The charger is a bit bulky if you're traveling but there may be a different travel charger available.

� What do I hate?
  SIZE
  The camera does seem a bit bigger than I expected.  It's not extremely heavy but it's certainly not a pocket digital camera.

  PRICE
  I don't feel as though I paid too much.  In fact, I think the price was just about right.  But I just have to complain about it anyway =)
