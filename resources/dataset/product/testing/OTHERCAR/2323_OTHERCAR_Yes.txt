            This car is a great buy.  I had originally gone car shopping with the intent of purchasing something similar to a Honda Civic.  When I arrived at the dealership, and negotiations started, I became aware that I would not be able to afford the monthly payments that would come from having the vehicle I had originally gone in to buy.  

So, I did some more shopping and comparing and found that to get a fully-loaded KIA would be cheaper than the lowest model of the other car I had intended to buy.  KIA has been making cars for many years now.  Before that they were making the parts and engines for semi-trucks.  This is the second KIA I had.  When I had first purchased one people all made fun of me because it was an unknown car.  

My experience is that they are very good and sturdy cars though.  I have been rear-ended a few times, and every time, nothing more than the bumper was damaged.  I am not one to treat a car as nice as I really should.  I have ran it over things that it shouldn't be run over, haven't always kept up with maintenance and other things you are NOT supposed to do with cars, and still it has held up very well.  

My previous KIA I put over 150K miles on it and it still ran great even after all the beatings it took.  This is a great car for the price!<br><br>
