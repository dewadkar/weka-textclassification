            	I recently had the pleasure of borrowing a friend's Dodge Ram Sport. Having driven the Ford F 150 and equivalent Chevy, I have to say that the Ram is just a totally sweet truck. I have promised my friend that if I ever want to trade in my Benz, I'm going to buy his truck.
	Even though it's a beast, the Ram is actually as easy to drive as a car. The height, visibility, and ease in dealing with traffic make this as much a joy to drive as the incredible speed and handling. Despite its size, the Ram actually corners really well, and I never felt at risk of rolling, even at rather high speeds. Even with only 2-wheel drive, the truck performed very well off-road, although I didn't do anything too strenuous (I wouldn't compare it to, say, a Land Rover!) But this truck is most at home on city streets, showing off its great looks and performance. With a variety of custom parts on my buddy's Ram, I can tell you I got quite a few looks from both the guys and girls, even compared to driving around in a Benz SL convertible. And although this truck might not have the speed of a sports car like that, it can certainly intimidate them into submission!
	All in all, the Ram is an awesome truck. Powerful, tough, but also gorgeous, this truck is happy hauling rocks or valet parking at the Ritz. If you are considering a truck, and can afford the admittedly high price tag, go no further than the Dodge Ram--I guarantee you won't regret it.<br><br>
