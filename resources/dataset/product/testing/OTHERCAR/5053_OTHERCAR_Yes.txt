            1. 4WD go-almost-anywhere capability with fabulous ground clearance and approach and departure angles.
2. Great capacity to carry cargo.
3. Great reliability (I have 110,000 miles on it with no major repairs except replacing timing belt)
4. Roof rack is very useful.
5. Lights turn off when ignition is off- I just run my lights all the time.
6. Great in the snow!!
7. Gas mileage (around 30mpg) has to be the best in 4wd vehicles.
8. Power/acceleration is terrible.
9. Road, engine, and wind noise is more than other cars.
10. Basically, I don't know why someone would want to own a Loyale unless it had the 4WD feature- it's what makes it all worth it- for capability and utility with good gas mileage.!
