            This new Toyota MR2 Spyder is definitely turning heads. In appearance and performance, this is the sportiest MR2 yet. The car handles like a dream, takes corners like a champ, you get the idea. I do have a couple relatively major criticisms, but I will save those for a couple of minutes. 

You have a choice of six colors on the MR2: red, blue, black, silver, yellow, or white. There are three interior colors: red, yellow or black. Your only option for interior material is cloth. I am sure you can purchase aftermarket leather, but from experience, I wouldn't recommend it. Aftermarket leather sometimes separates, or wears poorly, and you can have a hard time tracking down the original installers for repairs. The cloth interior is very attractive, and just think, you won't stick to it in the summertime. There's nothing worse than leaving three layers of thigh skin stuck to your seat. 

This car comes with a manual transmission and convertible top. No options there. Toyota does not offer a hardtop version of the MR2 at this point. I don't know why you would want an automatic transmission sports car, but it's a moot argument anyway, since it's not available.

The MR2 is quick and graceful. It comes equipped with a 4 cylinder, 138 horsepower engine. It's very fun to drive, especially with everyone checking you out. The car corners well, and takes off with power. 

Ok - I know this sounds like a glowing recommendation so far, but I haven't mentioned the fatal flaws that will keep me from ever purchasing this model of the MR2. If you are a normal-sized person, above 5'6&quot;, you will not be comfortable driving this car. I am 5'8&quot;, and I have two options on where to put my knees. They can either hit the steering wheel, or I can let my left knee be squished between the steering wheel and the door. Neither of these options appeal to me for any extended period of time. This car is so cute and fun, you will want to drive it all the time, but if you are uncomfortable in it, a little of the joy is sucked out of the experience. 

By far the biggest problem between myself and this car is the lack of storage. I know this seems like a stupid complaint to have about a sports car, but let me explain. There is no trunk on this car. At all. In the front is the spare tire, and in the rear is the engine. That's it. Then behind the seats, you have two very small locking compartments. Into these compartments you could possibly fit some cd's or tapes. Forget those weekend trips with your significant other. You can either take a passenger OR an overnight bag. Not both. Don't take this car to get groceries, or anything else that won't fit in the front seat. So if you want to drive this car to Vegas with your partner for the weekend, you will have to buy clothes when you get there, then throw them away, or have them shipped home.

On the basis of these complaints about the lack of roominess in this car, I cannot recommend it to the average consumer. I can only recommend this car to hermits, with no friends or family, or to someone who can afford a toy, who already has their &quot;real and functional&quot; vehicle for everyday life.
