            I am an I30 driver now, and I think the new I30 is a first-rate car. If I were buying a car, I would buy the I30 over the LS (even though I could get a &quot;loaded&quot; V-8 for around $33K).  However, leasing is another story.  On a 3-year lease, the Lincoln may compete -- I have already received offers from dealers for the low $500's, for a car that lists for over $39,000!  This is about the same as the new I30.  I think the ride, power, and plushness of the Lincoln exceeds that of the I30.  I do agree that manufacturing quality of the Infiniti is probably superior.  A lease means you can eventually walk from any problems (and, if the car is still under warranty you don't pay for them), which is why I am considering the LS for my next car.  I think the styling, especially the front end, of the LS is quite nice, by the way.

No question that the I30 is an excellent car and for someone who has never owned an American made car, this will be a leap if I go for it!!<br><br>
