            Had mine for close to a month.  I wondered what if I was going to hate or love it by this point.  I am coming from a V-6, and I absolutely look forward to getting behind the wheel.  Has suprising pickup, great handling in a car that gets around 50 MPG. 

So many positives:
near Silent
clean and comfortable
comes essentially in one model with - automatic air conditioning/heater, power doorlocks, windows, remote entry with alarm and engine immobilizer, all are automatic transmission.  Only options right now are floor mats and CD player

suprisingly roomy on the inside, outside dimensions appear much smaller

Toyota includes road side assistance and maintenance for the first three years

Anyone interested in learning the pro and cons of other people that are actually driving priuses I suggest you go look at the forums on:
http://www.egroups.com/group/toyota-prius 
or 
http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/toyotaprius
or of course the Toyota web site for more information
