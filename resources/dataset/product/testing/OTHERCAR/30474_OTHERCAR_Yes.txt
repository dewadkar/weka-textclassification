            I bought the 2000 Toyota Corolla VE model in November 1999.  I have two children ages 1 and 2 and to my surprise this car accomodates them well.  I travelled with them twice from San Diego to Phoenix and never felt cramped.  I bought the car because of its value and wonderful mechanical reputation.  First oil change not recommended for 7500 miles.  Excellent gas mileage.  It drives like a larger sedan with a very smooth transmission.  It is very easy to park and turn around.  I would highly recommend anyone buy this car.  Whether you are a college student or an Executive this a a great buy.  I hope to have this car for many years to come.<br><br>
