            I've owned my '93 Acclaim for three years now. I bought it certified used from a dealer in my area.

The 1993 Acclaim came in 4 and 6 cylinder models. I own the former and must say I have no complaints about this vehicle. Over the last 3 years, it's only been in the shop once for a broken axle casting. (a $100 repair) 

The interior of the Acclaim has ample room. It can comfortably seat 4 average sized people. If you are a tall driver, you may want to look into this vehicle as other passenger cars I've tried are cramped, even for me. (I'm only 5'10"). The trunk can easily fit three full golf bags and other accessories. Although I rarely fill the trunk to capacity, the space allows easy transfer to and from the vehicle.

I found some evidence of shoddy workmanship in my Acclaim. I've noticed that the trunk and passenger side door are slightly out of alignment with the adjoining body panels. I suspect that the springs in the trunk are anchored incorrectly but the door is troubling, as this can add drag and accelerate corrosion.

The Acclaim is a relatively heavy passenger vehicle. I find that the 4 cylinder model doesn't have the acceleration of a smaller car, but the ride is much smoother than a compact car.

The Acclaim has reasonable fuel efficiency. I can usually get 500km of city driving and 800km of highway driving on a full tank of gas. 

All in all, the Acclaim is a fine vehicle that will be great for people who want to get where they're going comfortably and within their budget. As always, keep you vehicle regularly serviced and will last much, much longer.
