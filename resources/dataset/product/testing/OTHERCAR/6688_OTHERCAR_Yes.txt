            My fianc� recently got a 99 C70 convertible, and wow.. it's awesome! She used to own a 96 Mustang convertible, and wanted a newer car that was more reliable (she had a lot of problems with it, the final straw being it getting flooded and then the brakes squeaking for the rest of the time she owned it.).

She got it pretty much loaded, with the in dash 3 CD changer, and the Dolby surround sound stereo setup. She didn't get the wood trim, which is good, wood trip is bad in any car in my opinion. Every time I see her driving the car, the first thing that pops into my head is &quot;dang, that is a beautiful car&quot; (Yes, she is beautiful too, but this isn't a review about my fianc�.. :-)

What I love about this car?

The seats! - it's true what they say, the Volvo seats are incredible. We've taking the C70 on a lot of road trips; Bay Area to San Diego, Bay Area to Palm Springs, and I never get tired of sitting in them. They are heating, which for people used to California heat is good when we get those really cold mornings of 30's F.

The Stereo - when I first read a review about this car, they talked about the stereo, how good it was, but with a silly speaker in the centre of the dash. Hey, this thing sounds so good I don't care where they put the speaker. If you are considering this car, take your favorite cd with you, and try it out. :-)

The Handling - this is possibly the best handling car I have had the chance to drive in a long time. I've tried a friends M3 convertible a few times, and the Volvo is a few notches down from that, but still very good. There are a few on and off ramps that are my favorite when driving it, it just goes where you point it.

The brakes - well, these brakes are awesome too! You press on them, and the entire car just sinks about an inch, and stops on a dime. No back end flaring up, no pulling one way or another, it just stops.

The convertible top - it's fully automatic, and takes about 30 seconds for up or down. No latches, no snaps, just up, or down. My fianc� would add that the big reason she likes it is because of the glass back window, she HATES plastic, because of the wrinkles, lines, and fading she's seen with other convertibles.

Safety - that was a big selling point for us, and at the dealership - the entire passenger compartment is surrounded by a big &quot;tub&quot; for crash safety. If the car ever flips, it has two bars behind the backseats that will popup, and prevent anyone getting hurt. The windshield frame is also supposedly VERY reinforced (as in they can drop the car on it, and it won't bend).

What I dislike (hate is too strong a word for the card!):

- If you are driving with the top down, your seat belts for the driver and passenger have a tendency to flap at about 60 mph and above. We found a quick solution to that, put up the windows on either side about an inch.

- back seat passengers will find the ride EXTREAMLY windy at speeds higher than about 50 mph. To the point that when I was riding in the back, I had to close my eyes and hold my head down.

- you really need the wind screen, that wind in the back tends to come forward at higher speeds. With the wind screen, you can go 90 mph and still hold conversations in the front seat. (Downside, it's extra, costs about $350).

- I've noticed in the past few weeks the brakes have been pulsating a bit. She hasn't taken it in yet to get it checked out.

- She got the lower pressure turbo, which for her is fine. I would prefer a little more get up and go at lower speeds. It's got enough to get the job done, and at about 35-45 mph it really starts to take off.. 70-90 happens very quickly.

- gas mileage has been pretty good for her - I think she gets about 20-25 mpg, on premium. I would have expected a bit more.

- price - it's pretty darn expensive.. however, it's really nice, and very safe.

I think anyone who is considering a convertible in this price range, should at least take one of these for a test drive... It's a super car!
