            *** WARNING: This opinion may be a bit biased since I've only driven Camrys as a primary vehicle of transportation my entire life *** :)

Update:  Added another pro - radio antenna

This is my first car as a working man, and I do have to say it's a dream.  I've only had it for about 1.5 months, so I guess my opinion isn't entirely "reliable".  But, give me a chance to explain the wonders - and blunders - of this piece of machinery.

Before I get into anything, note that I have an SE V4 model grade, Phantom gray color, 5-speed, non-ABS, with a "customized" option package #2 (better alarm, no power seats, and keyless entry) Camry. And yes, I have a stick even though it's a "family" car :)

The first thing you'll notice about the 2002 Camry is that it has a completely redesigned body. It has a smaller, more curvaceous hood, a raised frame, and a look that rivals the Audi; well, at least hood-wise. That said, some of you may disagree with that last tidbit, but being a "<i>doesn't</i> know much about cars" guy, first impressions hold some truth.  Anyway, let me try to explain these three features:

<b>Smaller, more Curvaceous Hood</b>
While this was the first thing I noticed, some of you may not notice it at all unless you've driven the older Camrys (I drove a 1996 Camry).  I loved the '96 Camry, in style and in performance, so when I saw the 2002, I was completely shocked and somewhat disappointed. I wanted the feel of a bigger, more "manly" engine, and the small hood didn't help. I actually considered looking into other cars just because of this new look, but the size of the hood is obviously not indicative of a weaker engine. Now after 1.5 months, it's grown on me and I love the new look :)  So, do you like curves on a car?

<b>Raised Frame</b>
I haven't actually measured the distance (and I don't plan to) from the ground to the floor of the car, but there is definitely a noticeable increase in height from previous years (and other 2002 sedans).  I haven't quite decided if I like the new look, but this is about you, not me :) So, do you want more of an Indy-500 race car or a Humvee?

<b>Rivals Audis</b>
This was another first impression.  The smaller, curvy hood just made me think of the Audi. I'm not in any way suggesting that the Camry is better than the Audi (it could be; I just don't know), but in my mind, an Audi is more of a luxury car than the Camry. In a way, this Audi-feel makes me feel that I got a better quality car for half the price! :) So, do you like Audis?


Ok, so that goes for the overall look and first impressions for the Camry.  I'm not going to go into the details at all, because I'm sure if you're reading this, you've already read the other ones and I'm sure they already went into it.  I think the best thing to do is for me to talk more about the PROS and CONS, one by one.

<B>PROS</B>
1. <I>Reliability</I> - My parents own an '87 Camry that's up at 195,000 miles and still running.  They also own a '96 Camry that has 65,000 miles and counting.  Need I say more?

2. <I>Smooth ride</I> - Self explanatory.  People have complimented me on the smoothness and have even fallen asleep on a 5-minute ride.

3. <I>Mileage</I> - I've gone 500+ miles. <i>Without</i> a full tank.

4. <I>Radio antenna</I> - this is one AWESOME feature! Instead of the typical antennas that "come out" of the car when the radio is on, it's built <B>INTO</B> the rear windshield! So, there's no way it can get bent or broken! I don't understand why other cars don't follow this.

5. <I>Manual drive</I> - I bought this car with only two hours prior manual drive experience (with a different car). Within a few days, I was an "expert" :)

6. <I>Decently fast comparatively</I> - This car isn't the fastest car in the market by any means; pulling at 157hp-192hp.  But if you compare these numbers to the other 2002 popular sedans, it measures up fairly well: 135hp-200hp Honda Accord, 175hp-240hp Nissan Altima, 125hp-165hp Mazda 626, and the 170hp-190hp Volkswagen Passat. It may look like family car, but it can be deceivingly quick.

Now here's the bad:

<B>CONS</B>
1. <I>Rain divergence</I> - the one thing I TRULY hate about the Camry is the POOR design for diverting rain!  If it's covered in water and you open any of the front doors (haven't "tested" with the rear doors), the water WILL drip onto your seats (drip, not pour). There aren't any rubber guards that catch the water and have it drain off to the side. I would have thought that this was a huge concern for Toyota, but obviously not!  If you don't know what I'm talking about, just open up any other car door and you'll see what I mean. At least they designed it so no water would drip into the trunk (good thing since I always have people sit in the trunk).

2. <I>Stealing</I> - one fact I doubt most of you realize is that the Camry is the most frequently stolen car in the United States. Why? High cost of factory parts. Within two weeks of buying my car, it was keyed by someone. Yes, I was VERY MAD!! Be careful.

3. <I>Color choice</I> - when I looked at the colors, there weren't too many I liked. I really liked the dark forest green of the '96 Camry, but this wasn't available for the 2002. The only green-based choice was a lighter Aspen green.  The other colors seemed too feminine for me, such as Catalina Blue, Salsa Red, etc. - bear in mind that this is in no offense to you ladies :) The only color I truly liked (and got) was the dark Phantom gray, which is surprisingly not a popular color among buyers (as told by my dealer).

4. <I>ABS optional</I> - Ok, anti-lock brakes can save your life. No debate. And they've been around for quite some time.  So, why doesn't Toyota (and every other car manufacturer) make these standard? I would have gotten ABS, but most (if not all) ABS-equipped Camrys that have ABS are those that come with higher option packages, and thus higher costs (~$3000). I couldn't look around for months and didn't have time to "Build my own Toyota".


Man, why do my reviews always take so long for me to write? It seems so simple in my head :) Well, there's my thoughts.  Take it for what it's worth.

Oh, and in case you were wondering. I got a good deal at Koons in Arlington, VA (good prices, bad agents - another review if Epinions had it) - paying $21,700 AFTER tax, fees, licensing, tags, etc.

Good Luck.
