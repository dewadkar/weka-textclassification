            Recently, I purchased a 2000 Mountaineer after searching many other dealerships.  I chose the Mercury because the price was in my range, and it had all the essentials I was looking for.  The gas mileage is also extremely good. 

This sports utility has all the extras.  It features a panel that tells the driver exactly how many miles till empty, and when the oil is low.  This feature is extremely good for people who don't know a lot about cars.  The steering wheel in itself can regulate the temperature in the vehicle, change the radio station, and change the volume.  The cruise control is also located on the steering wheel.  All the options can be performed without even one taking their eyes off the road.  No more reaching around and fooling with unnecessary buttons.  

The car has tons of space, is very comfortable, and has the child lock feature as well.  It makes a great vehicle to drive to work or take on an extreme road trip.  Next time your at the dealership, stop by Ford/Lincoln/Mercury.<br><br>
