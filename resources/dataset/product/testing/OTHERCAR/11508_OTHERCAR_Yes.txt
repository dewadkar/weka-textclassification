            I just purchased a new 2001 Nissan Maxima SE.  It's been my goal car for almost 6 years and I have finally done it!!!  YEAH...!!!  And what an awesome car it really is!

Nissan redesigned their cars for the 2000 series, increasing their horsepower by 32 (222hp now), redesigned styling, better suspension, 4 wheel ABS, etc.  These changes made the Maxima much better at handling and speed.

The interior of the Maxima is awesome.  In the SE model I purchased, all of the "Most Used" buttons such as radio stations, CD selections, volume, cruise, etc are on the steering wheel.  Much more convenient than having to reach for the buttons.  The actual dash buttons aren't the best in location and cause too much of a lapse in paying attention to the road. 

The leather installed on the Maxima is great.  Firm, yet soft, allowing for endurance and comfort for long trips.  Factory price is around $1400.00 but you can talk them down to $1000 if you try hard enough, I did.

My SE came equipped with the Bose sound system with 7 speakers.  This is probably my biggest surprise and disappointment in the Maxima.  I thought Bose was much better than what this sounds.  My previous car, 98 Toyota Camry, had an awesome sound system but this one leave room for improvement in Bass and overall sound levels.  This probably wouldn't be an issue with most people who listen to their music at normal levels but I tend to have high volume music playing all the time.

The only thing that I really find annoying or uncomfortable about my Maxima SE is that the brake and gas pedals are too close together for me.  When I am wearing boots or bigger shoes, my foot tends to get caught under the brake.  This is a design flaw in my opinion and a risk for the driver if they aren't aware of it.  Several times I had to jerk my foot to get it unstuck from under the breakpad because of the way my foots rests on the accelerator.  This too may not be a problem for many but for me it is.

The exterior of the Maxima is sweet.  Redefined, sleek and stylish.  I'm not 100% happy with the tail of the car, but in looking at it, there are several comparisons that can be made between the styling of the Maxima and one of the Lexus series cars.  Their front and rear designs are very similiar.

My Maxima came with the 17 inch tires, a requirement in my opinion to continue the sport look but also much better at handling and comfort on longer drives.  The only problem with the 17 inch tires will be the cost of replacing them.  Not cheap by any means.  Nissan gave me a replacement cost of about $175 per tire.  Ouch, that will hurt!

The speed of the Maxima is AWESOME.  When you touch the accelerator, your off.  You can feel and hear the power in the engine.  0 - 60 MPH happens quickly and with no lurching or rough gear changes for the automatic version.  It's smooth, agile and quick to the finish line.  I LOVE THAT! (I was in a 136hp Camry before so this is mega fast for me!)

All in all, my Maxima is my dream car and with the price that I paid, I will have it the full 6 years I financed it for then will be getting another one.  

Word of advice to potential buyers, MAKE A GOOD DEAL!  The sticker on my Maxima was $30,992 with the options I got.  Add the $1200 extended warranty and your looking at $32,192 or so.  After three weeks of dealing, my final price was $27,107.  There are big gains that Nissan makes off this car that with time, they will drop.  Take the car apart if you have to in order to drop your overall cost.  Check the internet and print off results. Call your credit union and get interest quotes.  Nissan will almost always match it to get your complete business!  

Some examples of my savings included:

 Leather - MSRP:  $1400              My Price:  $1000
 Extended Warranty - MSRP:  $1200    My Price:  $991
 Bose Sound - MSRP:  $899.00         My Price:  $500
 Nissan Interest Rate:  9%           My Interest:  8.25%
