            The car itself has held up very well over the 100,000 miles the previous owner put on it, other then a couple of interior stains from their children.  After I bought the car (Jan. '02), it looked brand new after a good wash and cleaning.  The engine was in perfect shape, runs smooth, no noises, and only needed minor maintenance.  The automatic transmission is the same story.  It shifts perfectly, and shows no signs of upcoming failure.

The engine (2.3L OHC) has an alright amount of power, but I would like more.  I suggest that if you are in anyway a power hungry individual that you get the 2.3L DOHC or 3.1V6, as they have more get up and go.  However, for the everyday driving the 2.3L OHC gets the job done nicely, while getting 27mpg.  Also, GM fixed problems of earlier versions of this engine for the 1994 version, so there is no need to worry about head gasket failure.
 
Handling is what this car has.  On twisty roads I almost never have to brake for a turn, this baby takes them at almost every speed.  Very responsive.  It makes you want to roll the windows down and just cruise for miles.  However, you must turn the radio up so you can't hear the rattles and squeaks from the interior.  

In no way do I regret the purchase of this car, it is reliable, easy to maintain, handles well, and looks sporty and I would gladly purchase another Grand Am.
