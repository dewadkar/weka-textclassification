            With a burgeoning family only getting bigger (our 3rd is due in April), we, well O.K, my wife decided that we needed a minivan. To be more specific, a Honda Odyssey. Nothing, and I mean nothing other than an Odyssey would do. So after some rather exhausting research, we decided to put in an order for the van. Due to such high demand, a buyer has very little bargaining power and thus the rather high price-tag. We paid 26,500 for the lower end model but with the added features of a roof-rack, keyless entry, rear A/C, and alloy wheels. This was the TOTAL price including everything...tags, title, taxes, delivery fee etc. So all in all, I feel that we got a really good deal.

The drawback is the inordinate amount of time it takes for the vehicle to finally arrive...we waited 3 months! However, it is well worth the wait. There is truly nothing inferior about the Odyssey...quite simply, it far and away outpaces any rival! As we look back, we wonder how in the world we got along with out it. Further, it has plenty of accessible room, the seats are both functional and easy to work with and the little &quot;extras&quot; are all well placed. Truly an outstanding, yet costly vehicle.<br><br>
