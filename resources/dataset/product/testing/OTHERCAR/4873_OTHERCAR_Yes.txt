            Granted, I use to think Saab owners were snobs, but with the amazing lease deals currently (as of writing) available on the 2002 SE, even average Joe can now afford one of these beauties.  The car is amazing, plain and simple.  I love the zip it has from the I4 Turbo engine off the line AND cruising past the right-laners on the highway.  even up hills on the highway, never have I even thought about downshifting to 4th to pass said motorist on the left.  Granted, I am comparing everything to my previous VW Jetta, but this 2002 9-3 really hums.  And the trunk, you could fit a large family of pygmies back there!  I opted for the 5-speed to increase the fun, but I've also driven the autos and they are every bit as responsive (though less fun).  I have the standard cloth/leather combination, wood dash, pwr divers seat, moonroof and single CD, but the Premium pkg is available for relatively little extra on the leases.  I also got the Steel Grey paint job, and I have never been more pleased with the amount of dirt this hue hides before it begs to be washed.  Very low maintenance on the exterior.  Plus, the 9-3 has only 3 scheduled service stops during my 36 mth lease, at 10K, 20K, and 30K.  This includes oil changes and everything...seriously...10K miles before you have to even contemplate service on this one.All in all, I'm super pleased with the dealership experience, the car in general, and the entire Saab culture (or cult as it may be).  I am certainly driving WAY MORE car than I am paying for, but I'd have to believe this car is still a good deal at the $30K sticker too without any special incentives.  I can't speak for the car in the long-term as of yet, but it's encouraging that I have some friends with 150K on their old Saabs and they still keep plugging along as if they were driven right off the lot today.
