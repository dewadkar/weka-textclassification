            I looked at low-end Nissan Xterra which had only 2-wheel drive.  Although it was low-end, I thought it had many &quot;extras&quot; included. 

The vehicle I looked at and drove was red, had cd, air, power everything, security system, sun roof, sunroof, and roof rack.  It looked kewl and it handled very, very well.  It also seemed to have pretty good pickup but I wouldn't say it was excellent.

What I liked about this particular SUV was that it was priced at only $17,000.  

What I didn't like about it was the seats felt really stiff and uncomfortable.  I would not want to be sitting in this vehicle for any length of time.  One other odd feature was the sunroof which couldn't be open because the roof rack being on the top.  What were you thinking Nissan??????

Overall, it was a very nice looking vehicle.<br><br>
