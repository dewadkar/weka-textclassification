                ItalDesigned, German Engineered, Austrailian built engine (Porsche developed engine), Transmission tuned by Lotus...and most importantly, Korean Built...well, that should be interesting enough..... 
    
    I find the Daewoo Leganza especially interesting because of its outstanding designed exterior and interior, the exterior reminds me of Lexus in front and Mercedes from the rear, the interior reminds me of some kinds of modern sports car.
  
    When I first saw Leganza I thought it was going to cost as much as 300M, but price starting at about 14,888 for this modern, graceful-looking car surprised me, and when I first set down in Leganza, I thought I was going to fall asleep. VERY comfortable and well designed seats, I also felt like I was in a luxury car...the leather and plastic used in Leganza CDX seemed like it was higher level than the ones found in 300M.
    Leganza's ride somehow disappointed me though, maybe I was too excited by its looks, I know for a fact that the ride was not bumpy nor squeeky, it felt very stable and peppy unlike some of the critics had mentioned...but one thing that would have made me impress with the ride would have been probably a V-6 engine...I have heard that Leganza will be riding on Porsche developed V-6 engine providing more than 200hp within some years. 

    I believe that Leganza CDX would be best to be used for going into city, in fact, a lot of people in the parking had complemented how good my car looked but people who lives in rocky or hilly-like road might want to wait until it comes out with its V-6 engine...

    P.S.I: those who also like to listen to music very loud would love Leganza's stereo system...it is one of the best I have used...just try it
    P.S.II:   I have heard many under rated things about this vehicle, but I just want to say that you will never know until you really drive it.<br><br>
