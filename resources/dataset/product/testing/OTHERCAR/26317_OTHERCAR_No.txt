            It's either &quot;<b>NOOOOOOOOOOO</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>HAHAHAHAHAHA</b>&quot; that I say whenever I see one of these. Who can keep a straight face when your mild privacy on the road is invaded with one of these? I've seen anything and everything done to and with this car. I've even seen someone hook up a nitrous oxide kit. Why?.

As car that has all stock parts and driven by someone who actually takes it for a car and nothing else, it's just plain ugly. And as far as they're concerned, it's a means of personal transit and only an asset because of financial problems, not a cry for help (see below). Ouch? Ouch.

<b>BUT</b> for those who buy one of these to modify it in a way that they can't do with their personal lives, there is only one word for you: NO! Something about this car must evoke a chemical imbalance in the brain tricking the owner or would-be owner into purchasing or modifying this car. That's the only logical explanation. This and it's look-alike predecessor, the Honda Civic CRX (del sol) pollute the roads. Not in the conventional way of exhaust emissions, but rather ugliness and noise pollution.

You know who you are. Go ahead and take a drive to the shop now and get those windows tinted a little darker so you don't have to show others that your face is as silly looking as your car. Or maybe buy some louder exhaust tips, paint it yellow, install some neon lighting, put on a full-windshield sticker (for that EXTRA <b>5</b> horsepower), or do something productive and take it to the car compactor.

Whatever you do, just keep this car away from me! YUCK!<br><br>
