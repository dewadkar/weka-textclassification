            Just recently had the chance to spend a long weekend of driving in my Brother-in Law's 1999 Jetta TDI.  Being a fan of VW's (I own an &quot;88 Jetta with over 300,000 kms on the clock)I was eager to put this TDI to the test.

First, the wonderful TDI engine.  For anyone not familiar with this type of diesel engine, RUN, don't walk down to your nearest VW shop and have a go!  This engine only smokes a very little upon start up and has a lovely subdued but strong engine noise at idle.  The torque band is strong and available right up to 5000 rpm and it just keeps coming.  This is hard to imagine unless you've felt it.  At 65 mph the engine is silently purring at 2300 rpm and to pull out and pass someone is effortless.  The car I drove had VW's adaptive automatic and you can barely feel the shift points.  Very well mated package.

The rest of the car is very nice as well.  In Europe,VW is a major manufacturer of cars and it shows.  The Jetta(Bora in Europe)doesn't sell there very well, as they prefer the hatchback usefulness of the Golf.  VW's Chairman is trying to get VW up to BMW image and they look like they are going in the right direction.  The fit and finish is impeccable with very high quality throughout.  The switchgear and heated seats are fantastic.  The rear seat room is an issue however and prospective buyers better think long and hard as to who will ride with them in the back.

Consider the jetta if you are looking at Camry or Accord. Especially try the TDI engine if 50mpg is important to you.  It will change your mind about diesel engines.
