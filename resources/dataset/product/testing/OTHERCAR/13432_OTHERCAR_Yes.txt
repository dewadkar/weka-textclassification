            This is not the newest, flashiest, biggest, nor most powerful utility vehicle on the market.  It IS, however, it is the best utility vehicle overall.  Chevrolet has continued to offer the solid S-series Blazer with enough trim levels and suspension options to suit anyone.  It tows trailers well, it has plenty of power (and, equally importantly, enough useable torque) and it burns SIGNIFICANTLY less fuel than the V-8s that other comparable vehicles may offer.  Dollar for dollar, this is the toughest and best equipped utility vehicle out there.

The drawbacks of the Blazer are about the same as any other utility vehicle - high center of gravity causes greater body roll in the corners; the suspension is designed to offer a good compromise between on- and off-road driving (something Chevy has done excellently well, but which an on-road driver might not require nor appreciate), and heavier construction.  This is definitely not a sports car, and a wagon would be better suited for runs to soccer practice and the grocery store.<br><br>
