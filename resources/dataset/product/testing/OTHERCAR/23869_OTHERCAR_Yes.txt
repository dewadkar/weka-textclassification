            I've always owned foreign cars, mostly Honda's and encouraged my grandmother to buy this brand new accord in August of 1992. 
After looking at several Honda's we came across a 92 maroon 2 door Accord, we both loved the design and the gray interior. We test drove the car that day and loved the way it handled, it had lots of power and handled well at all speeds, on the dry pavement. We went back the next day because it was raining and I test drove it again, It handled great in the rain as well. I was amazed at how well.

We bought the car and drove it home the next day, in the past 9 years we have had nothing but good luck. Please note that this car has been taken care of, regular maintenance, oil changes, etc. No major repairs have had to be done except for the usual replacement of tires, brakes and exhaust system. 

As i said, the car handles well in all types of weather, in the winter of 1995 I was out of town for the day and got caught in a blizzard, I had no problems making it home in this car, with very little slipping and sliding.

The interior of the car is very roomy, its a 2 door, and the seats go way back, so there is plenty of legroom, my late grandfather had a problem with his leg and this was one of the few cars he could manage getting in and out of. Everything in the car is power, windows, locks, brakes, steering, etc. The backseat also has plenty of room as well. 

The exterior of the car is in excellent condition, no chipped paint, rust or body rot. 

The car gets excellent gas mileage, in town and on the highway as well. As of 4/5/01 the car has 93,000 miles on it and runs as if it was brand new.
