            We purchased a lease returned model of this truck 2 wks ago so reliability is still up in the air.  We spent months shopping truck dealers.  My husband wanted a full size pick-up, I insisted we get a 4-door.  Our 13 year-old is already a six footer!  I have impaired eyesight that limits the size of the vehicle I can drive so I was leary of the full size pickups.  
We saw this little beauty and decided to give it a try and we were both impressed.  Room is a little tight in the back for the teenager but since I can pull my seat up and still be comfortable it solved that problem. I liked the tight compact size and smaller more efficient engine since gas prices are up and continuing to rise.  My husband liked the fact he can take his buddies fishing with him without taking 2 vehicles.
After owning this truck for 2 years I can say it is very reliable and very uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time.  My back hurts just thinking of a long drive.  Gas usage is good but not great.  It tows our 19' boat but feels like it is working hard when it does.  I still like this truck overall except for the front seats.
The teenager thinks its cool looking and anticipates it lasting long enough for him to learn to drive on it.  The only drawback we can find so far is that the kids are so close the noise level is almost unbearable.  The engine feels and sounds like it is straining when you gun it but is smooth as silk otherwise.  Handling is tight and easy and parking is great.  Backing up is no problem because it is no bigger than most mini vans. Short bed may be a problem when heavy duty hauling is required.  Lumbar support in front seats is stiff but I need to be told to sit up straight anyway!
