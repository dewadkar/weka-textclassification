            Even with all its problems, I still love it.  It is an absolutely gorgeous vehicle.  But I'm still not sure if it's worth it.  Having bought it used and only owned it for 6 months, it has been in the shop more than a half dozen times.  Granted, some of the problems may be the dealership's fault (things not fixed correctly the first time) but the problems are too numerous to just blame them.  Both rear seatbelts have broken, one during my 60 day warranty, and the other the day after it expired.  The traction control has not worked properly since purchased, and the computer problems are too numerous to describe.  But there's nothing like sitting in the driver's seat and taking off.  Plenty of power and get-up-and-go -- it just feels good --  and a ride so quiet and smooth that I couldn't always tell it had stalled until the power steering went (that was the last computer problem).  All in all, I love it, but will not be replacing it with another Aurora.<br><br>
