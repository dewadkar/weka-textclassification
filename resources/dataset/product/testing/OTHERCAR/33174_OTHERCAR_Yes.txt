            I always drove American made vehicles. The last American made car I bought
was an 1994 Olds.Achieva V6 Special Model. I had so much trouble with that
car.  I couldn't wait until I could sell it. In 1996 I was in a car accident, which totaled my Olds. Achieva. So now I had the chance to buy a different type of Auto. I looked around from car dealer to car dealer. I finally decided to go to a Honda Dealer. I bought my first used car from the Honda Dealer. I never bought a used car before, prior to 1996 I always purchased new cars. I was concerned about buying a used car, but this one came with a warranty and had low mileage. So that made me feel secure about dealing with getting other peoples problems.  I bought a 1994 Honda Accord Coupe.  It drove like a baby, except it was a V4 engine and the pick up was a little slower than a V6 that I was used to.
I really liked the Honda, and I decided that I would always be a Honda Girl. Last year I upgraded my Honda to 1997 
Honda Accord Special Addition. It Has everything a driver could want it's a
great vehicle. I just love my car. All I ever have to do is change the oil
every 3000 miles and my car never fails me.
