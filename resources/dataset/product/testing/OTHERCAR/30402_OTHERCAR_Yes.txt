            I have heard to very distinct opinions of this vehicle...love it...hate it. This opinion is based primarily on the overall look of the vehicle, but love it or hate it, this vehicle has alot to offer active, on the go people.  

This vehicle is the first of its kind, being named a sport recreational vehicle as opposed to a sport utility vehicle, because of all the versatility which it offers its owner. 

 If you are someone who loves the outdoors, this vehicle is for you.  It comes with a removable centre console which doubles as a cooler, an optional camping package with a tent and air mattress, and a slide out rear organizer to keep everything in place.  If you love music like I do, you'll love the rear audio controls for those tail gate parties. 

 This vehicle was designed to attract young buyers, but I wonder how well they can afford one, with a well equipped model listing out at about $35,000 Canadian.  Nevertheless, Pontiac has taken a step out of the ordinary with this vehicle, and it may be a sign of things to come.<br><br>
