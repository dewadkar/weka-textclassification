            The reason i bought this car was for SAFETY!I recently had a wreck in mine.It done about $2,000.00 dollars worth of damage to my car but it totaled the other guys car!I was going under 35 mph and I didn't get slung around or anything!The car right now has over 124,000 miles on it and still going!I don't hate anything about my lumina,I love every thing about it.Since I have got this car driving has became one of my hobbies.Anybody who wants a safe reliable car....This is the one!! This is one of the best cars I have ever seen and I will never have any thing else! <br><br>
