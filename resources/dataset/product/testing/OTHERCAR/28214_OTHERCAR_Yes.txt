              I was really impressed with what I saw on commercials about the 1999 Dodge Durango, and I was very excited about taking it for a test drive.
My family and I drove down to the dealership in Texarkana, Tx. in my Pontiac, and after talking to the salesman for a while, we all agreed on the Cherry Red one.
It's an extremely impressive SUV. The design is sleek, not a bad price (about 37,000.00)if memory serves correctly, beautiful interior, loaded with amenities, such as cd player, tape deck, folding seats, lots of room/storage space, individual air control, power everything, even a spare. This appeared to be exactly what we were looking for.

 There were two things that actually dissuaded me from buying this vehicle. 

On take-off, the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have the pick-up that I was expecting; not at all. In fact, it felt like it had internal problems that were causing it to lag.
Once out on the road, the salesman told me to hit the highway, so I did.
I figured that maybe it just needed to be opened up and the acceleration would be fine. Wrong.
The pick-up was no better at 65 mph than it had been at 30 mph. To add to that, the breaks were extremely touchy. That made me nervous, because if I had only intended to break slightly to pass someone, I could have ended up coming to a complete stop in the middle of the road. And we all know how that can end up. The breaks were so tight in fact, that it actually screeched every time we stopped. I brought it back to the dealership a few minutes later, disappointed in the overall performance, and a nervous wreck. I have never owned an SUV, so I don't know if they're all made that way, or if it was just that one, or maybe all Durangos, but that experience turned me off of the idea of buying that particular one.

If it had had better acceleration and less touchy breaks, I'd be driving it today. Like I said, it is a very nice machine, lots of perks, not to mention a great stereo system, and aside from those two shortcomings, I would recommend it to anyone who likes to travel, has a family or transports a lot of people, wants a comfortable ride, and just enjoys driving.

I have mixed feelings about the 1999 Durango, and if they ever improve those two things, I will definitely give the test drive a second go.
