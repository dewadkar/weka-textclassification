            I LOVE this car.  I bought it last year from my father with 175,000 miles on it.  It's only had two owners besides me, my father and another guy who recognized it as I was getting gas.  He said &quot;How many miles now?&quot; I told him and he said, &quot;She still runs beautifully doesn't she?&quot;  I told him all we did was replace the timing belt and besides that no other repairs.  He just nodded his head.  
My particular model is a 1989 Prelude S in Gold.  No power windows or doors, but then again, they can't break.  It has a power sunroof though.  It is in excellent condition, except someone hit it in a parking lot and broke one of the parking lights and beat up the bumper's paint.  Besides that. the only problem is leaking oil, i think i cracked the oil pan gasket.  It is at 191,000 miles now and is still the most fun to drive car i've driven.  The steering on these cars is exquisite, with just the right amount of power to make it easy.  I can't stand mushy steering.  The S model is a little on the weak side but with the manual transmission, it can hold it's own.  Also, the transmission is a pleasure to to shift, it's very slick and has never failed me.  The front seats are very roomy, while the back... Well, i don't ride in the back, but i get to laugh at my friends contorting themselves to fit.  Also, my air conditioner doesn't work, but i always drive with the windows and sunroof open, so i really don't care, it would just make it less fuel efficient anyway. 

By the way, I'm a drummer, and I can fit my whole 6-piece drumset plus it's rack in the car with the backseat down.  So whoever says it's too small, imagine that!

I also installed a Pioneer CD player and upgraded Sony 3-way 5 1/4&quot; speakers.  It sounds beautiful, although it was kind of hard to fit the speakers, as they are supposed to be 5&quot; openings.  <br><br>
