            When wen purchased the Nissan quest I was so excited.  I had wanted a minivan for quite some time. we drove many vehicles before deciding on the quest.  I really liked the quest it drove almost like my Nissan ultima which I loved.   The quest is very nice seats 7 in all but Only 5 children if you don't put children in the front with the air bag.  Owning a child care business I use my vehicle often and it is very nice to have the ability to seat so many children.  When buying the vehicle the promotion was a tv/vcr installed int the van.  The tv was such a wonderful idea the children love it and it has been a life saver on the long trips.  
we have had some problems with the brakes and already had to replace them at less than one year.  being so new we had to buy the brakes at the dealer and of course wasn't cheap.  
Over all I love the Nissan quest.  <br><br>
