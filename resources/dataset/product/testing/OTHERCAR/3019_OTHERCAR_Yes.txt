              The 1994 Nissan 240SX convertible is as sleek and stylish as it is 
sporty and economical. The vehicle's slender curves and aerodynamic body 
are pleasing to the eye, attracting both young and old people alike. 
  
  
  I was actually in search of a Mustang convertible when I fell head over heels in love with this car. The 240SX is the ideal sports car for anyone who wants a vehicle that is &quot;peppy&quot; but most importantly, one that doesn't guzzle gasoline. The 240SX gets 21 mpg in the city, and 26 mpg on the highway. I have seen by my own personal experience with my 240SX, that the 4 cylinder, 2.4 liter, 155 horsepower, 16 valve engine has enough power and endurance to pass a late model Mustang with a V-6 engine, hindering it's ability to keep up.
  
  
  The 240SX, being a compact sports car, is just that. Compact. The vehicle's cargo capacity which is only 5.1 cubic feet, is tragic for those who travel a lot, like myself. Packing lightly is key when driving the 240SX on a road trip. Leaving extra passengers behind is critical as well. The 240SX may have a back seat, but finding leg room is nearly impossible. The front seats are spacious with plenty of room to stretch out, which leaves about two and 1/2 inches of space between the front and back seats. Moving the front seats forward may solve the problem, but will only be temporary due to the lack of comfort that is now cramping the driver and front passenger to the dash. This car is perfect for anyone who enjoys sports cars, only has one passenger riding with him/her, and who carries very little cargo.
  

  I have owned nothing but Mustangs since I was 14 years old. Just a month ago I purchased a 1994 240SX SE convertible. I'm proud to say that it tops everything I've had in the past. Comparing to my Mustangs, the 240SX has a very quiet running engine, and the ride itself is smooth and gentle, with little noise from the convertible top. This is a vehicle I will keep for a very long time.   <br><br>
