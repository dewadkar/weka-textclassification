            I found this camera on a website, where it was the deal of the day. After checking the available stats, I made the ultimately wise decision to purchase it.

The RDC-6000 is my first digital camera, and I had no previous experience with any digital cameras. What I found was a user-friendly, feature-packed, inexpensive entry level camera.

The camera is rather small, yet wide. There's a multipurpose circular switch on the top of the camera that allows you to switch between modes: options, movie, photo, review, trash, and transfer. Also on the top of the camera are three additional buttons for the flash, timer, and picture mode (size and quality). Finally, there's a small display that tells you what picture mode you are in, how many pictures you have left, the state of the flash, etc.

On the back of the camera is a small LCD screen that allows you to preview your photos and movies, as well as a few more buttons that serve as navigation when the camera displays it's options. An additional feature is the ability to turn the LCD screen off, saving precious battery time. One small quibble: the LCD can be incredibly dark, even at higher levels of ambient light. It does feature a brightness setting, but at a high level of brightness, the LCD image is washed out and not representative of the picture you will receive.

The ease of use and value of the RDC-6000 are it's best features. The user-defined settings and modes are numerous. It has three zoom levels, several focus and white-balance options, monochromatic and sepia toned options as well. 

The camera came with a rechargeable battery, as well as the charging unit. Charging is quick, and tends to last quite awhile, as long as you are careful with the use of the LCD. The camera has a built in battery meter so you always know how much of a charge remains.

The Ricoh RDC-6000 also came with an 8 megabyte Smartmedia card, which are not the most commonly used storage media, but are still quite popular. I bought an additional one at a local chain of a national electronics retailer. I've found that one 8 megabyte card is enough for pictures of one event. On the 800x600 resolution mode, using the &quot;fine&quot; quality mode, I can take around 30 pictures. Moving the quality mode to &quot;normal&quot; yields almost double the amount of pictures. 

The included software is simple and effective, but does not have many features. Downloading to the computer is as easy as connecting the USB cord to the camera, turning the camera on, and clicking through a menu or two. Thumbnails are conveniently shown onscreen, so you are aware which pictures you are choosing to download.

Overall, this camera is well worth the suggested price. If you are a digital novice, seeking a full featured digital camera for personal, or light professional use, check the RDC-6000 out. <br><br>
