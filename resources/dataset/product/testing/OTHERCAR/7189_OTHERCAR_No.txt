            After purchasing my 4 Nissan in about 6 years I think I am a very good customer of Nissa Motors, But the last 2 Nissans I purchased a 1996 Nissan Maxima and 1996 Nissan Sentra I found out what customer service shouldn't be like.  On my 1996 Nissan Maxima when it needed a minor repair I took it to my local dealer Dan Mullins Nissan in Lawton, OK and at the same time I took my 1996 Nissan Sentra in for a recall repair and I was waiting for the 2 vehicles in the showroom when a salesman came up to me and asked if I would trade my Nissan in for a new one but I told the salesman that I wouldn't purchase another Nissan because after the sale the dealer wouldn't make good on repairs that my 1996 Sentra needed approximately 6 months prior to this incident.  And I was voicing my opinion and apparently the salesman who was really the sales manager didn't like what I was saying about the product asked me to leave not knowing that my car was in for repairs but after he found out that my cars were in for repair he told the service manager to get both of his cars off the racks and return to me unfixed---so I left the dealership and proceeded to call the Nissan Corporate Headquarters when I was told that every dealership was in its own a independent businessman and Nissan Corp had no control over their dealership so I was forced to take my vehicles to another Nissan dealership about 200 miles away---So the moral of the story is check out the local dealership with the BBB for complaints about them before purchasing a vehicle from them.  <br><br>
