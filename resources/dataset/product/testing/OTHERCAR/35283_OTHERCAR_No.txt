            We bought this car for my wife to use for the next 8 years as our family grew.  Initially, everything seemed to run smoothly and we were pleased with the cars performance.  Within the past year though, the car started to shudder when braking.  Also, the brakes seem to catch when applying a small amount of pressure. This gives the passengers in the car the feeling that the driver is really stepping hard on the brakes.  There is one other &quot;problem&quot; that does not sit well with me in regards to this car.  When driving on the interstate the RPM's are well into the 3500 to 4000's at 70 mph.  In comparison, the Nissan Altima we own had no problem doing 90 mph at just over 3000 RPM's.  The car has plenty of pick up for acceleration and handles well when driven.  We haven't been disappointed with the car but are not overly enthusiastic about the car either. <br><br>
