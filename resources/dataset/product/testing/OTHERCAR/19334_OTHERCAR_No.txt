            Ok ok, some of you are probably beginning to suspect that I am just a big Jeep fan.  Although this is true I like to think that I look at everything with an unbiased eye.  I have had several opportunities to drive the Land Rover, both off road and on long road trips.  

In my opinion the Land Rover is an impressive looking vehicle.  It is <b>BIG</b>, especially when you first drive it.  Actually it is shorter length wise than my Jeep Cherokee, but far taller with far more leg room.  The interior has all sorts of bells and whistles that try to make you feel good about spending so much money on this car.  In the front seat there are two separate temperature controls for passenger and driver.  All windows are controlled from the center console unit (which I don�t really like).  The seats are actually very comfortable�you kind of sink into them when you first get in the car.  The car has two sun roofs, one for the front and one for the back.  These add to the �gimickiness� of the car and are a nice feature.  One thing I must give this car is how great it is to be so high�.it gives you the feeling of invincibility on the road. 

How does this car drive you ask?  Well off road wise this thing is pretty amazing.  To be honest I have not had the opportunity to properly put the car through its paces, but you can just <i>feel</i> that you will have no problem on the trail.  The problem is though that many people who buy this car buy it for the highway.  This is where my complaints begin.  For me the drive of the car is what is primarily important.  Sure the car has to look nice, but if it drives poorly then get rid of it.  I recently took this car to take my sister back to school in Ohio.  It is an eight-hour trip and we needed a big car to fit all of her stuff in the car.  The trip started out fine, cruise control engaged ready to handle the doldrums of Pennsylvania and Ohio. When I got to Western Maryland and Pennsylvania I had to disengage the cruise control.  Why?  <b>Because the car couldn�t handle the hills</b>.  Now, the Land Rover has a V-8 in it, and I would have thought that this would have been no problem.  The thing is that the Rover is very heavy, and that is the main reason for such a big engine.  On these rolling hills that my $20,000 Cherokee handles with ease, I had to manually downshift the car (the car is an automatic) so that I could maintain speed!  This is ludicrous in my mind, and turned me off to the car immediately.  

The other thing about this car is gas.  All of the Rover models only take high test gasoline.  That�s right, the really expensive stuff.  In combination with its 15 mpg on the highway (you don�t want to know the city mpg) it makes this already overpriced car even more so.  I have also heard that this car is very expensive to maintain.  Every repair is more expensive than most normal cars, as well as some features not being reliable.   Peter_D_Anderson is right, spend the money on a Grand Cherokee.
