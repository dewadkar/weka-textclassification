            We got a two year old Camry last year (as a used car).  My husband is a salesman with a large territory and he needs a very reliable car that also offers a smooth ride.  This spelled CAMRY to us.  We have some friends who have had Camrys so we were familiar with them.  

Our experience with this car has proven to us that it is nothing short of exceptional!  We have always bought Toyotas because we have found them to be very well made, reliable and able to take some punishment as my husband's job demands.  This is the first year though that we ever had a Camry.  I really like the leg room in front and the way the dashboard kind of contours around the front of the car.  Best of all though is the reliability.  In the last year, my husband put nearly 40,000 miles on that car -- some of it city driving, a lot of it highway.  Except for oil changes and gasoline, that car has required nothing in the way of maintenance or repairs.  Also, being a salesman, my husband needed a car with a big trunk so he could carry around catalogs and parts (he sells pneumatic equipment).  The Camry's trunk is very roomy.  Not only can he fit all of his sales stuff in there, but he also has room for groceries!

I just can't say enough good things about this car!  It is definitely a car from which you are certain to get your money's worth!<br><br>
