            The Jeep Wrangler is truly a four season vehicle.  In the summer it's a convertible.  You can take the top down and cruise around the sand dunes or feel the breeze in your hair on the way to the snowball stand.  In the winter it's got one of the best and most proven four wheel drive systems in the world to help you get from point a to point b even with 3 feet of snow and ice on the road.  
But this is nothing new.  Jeeps have been around forever.  What makes the new Jeep Wrangler &quot;TJ&quot; (as the new ones are designated from 1997 on) stand out from all of the other Jeeps: CJs, YJs ... etc.  I know from personal experience that the TJ is comfortable and easy to live with every day.  The interior is inviting and full of conveniences that previous Jeeps lacked.  For instance, a locking console and glove box standard on Sport and Sahara models (which, incidentally, should be your only options, the SE model is underpowered with a small 4 cylinder and under optioned without a radio of any or kind or even a back seat!) and the option of lockable trunk space.  The air conditioning is superb although it costs about $1,000.  Even with the soft top in place winters are toasty warm with the fantastic heater and defroster standard on all models.  I would recommend against the hard top because of its hefty price and weight about $1,800 and too heavy for even the most beefy linebacker to take off and put on by himself... not to mention the need for storage space when you want to go topless in your new Jeep.  

I would recommend going to the Jeep website and choose all of the options that you like (and there are a lot) and see what you come up with in terms of what you can afford.  The website helped me out a lot because you can see what's available with out having a dealer trying to jam options down your throat.  I could talk all day about the new Jeep Wrangler but I have other stuff to do so thank you for reading my review I hope it helped!
