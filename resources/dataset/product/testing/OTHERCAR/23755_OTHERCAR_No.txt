            and I really hate to do this...but from all the Jettas I have ever been in (see I have a friend and 2 family members who own them)...I have to say that these are truly pieces of J-U-N-K.  I hate to do that, but I have reason and I'm sure I will get a million responses saying &quot;Don't say stuff about Jettas, they're great!&quot; and true, they are quite eye-catching and I even considered buying one, but after all that my friend and my family have been through, I would never invest in one.

Okay...now let me EXPLAIN.  Various things have gone wrong with all 3 Jettas.  2 out of the 3 have had to be taken back down to the dealership and have the ENTIRE stereo replaced (including the antenna).  2 out of the 3 have had to have the sunroof repaired for leaks, and yes, I know this happens, but just after a couple of months after buying one BRAND-NEW?  Come on, you all know that's crappy.  All 3 have had problems with the door locks locking and then not UNLOCKING.  And 1 has had the alarm get turned on when she couldn't get the door unlocked and it was hauled back to the dealership, via tow-truck, with the alarm going off all way to the next town.

Well, I know I can't really change anyone's mind about what car they have their heart set on, and who knows?  Maybe all three cases of the &quot;Bad - Jetta&quot; were just a coincedence...but I wouldn't recommend buying this car.  It's bound to have uncountable problems in the long run.
