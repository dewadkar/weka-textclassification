            My husband and I got this car as a wedding/college graduation gift from my parents.  Overall, we love it.

The car handles well, we live in an area with a lot of curvy roads, this car corners magically!  After driving a 4-cylinder, driving this car again is like a whole different world.  It has great acceleration.

I also love how roomy the car is for it's overall size.  The back can be a tight fit for full grown adults, but the front seats have quite a bit of space.  

The down side to this car is the cost of repairs.  We have had to replace a transmission, and that of course, had quite a hefty price tag.  But other things, such as our brakes and tires, have been surprisingly expensive.  Some things (i.e. transmission) seem to wear out a little faster than on most cars.

I would recommend this care to almost anyone.  If you have older children, it may not be ideal due the small back seat.  And if you have children at all, I would recommend a four door, not the two-door model we own.<br><br>
