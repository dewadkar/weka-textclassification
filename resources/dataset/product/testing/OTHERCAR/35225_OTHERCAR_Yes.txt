            When we were test driving SUVs our main problems were: they were uncomfortable, hard to handle, and generally ratty cars.  With the Toyota 4 Runner, that is not a problem!  First of all, the inside is designed for maximum comfort to the passengers, and it is not a chore to get into it because of a built in step, and it's general low stature in comparison to other SUVs.  Cruise control, overdrive, cd player, and air conditioning are all also options allowing for you to be in almost beach like comfort.  As for the drivability of this horse, it is a dream.  It handles wonderfully, and the controls are easy to use.  The 4 wheel drive is a life saver in snow and heavy rain.  The cargo space in the back is plentiful, and several well placed compartments and holders around the vehicle make for a completely wonderful driving machine.  About the only downsides are that the car tends to use up a lot of gas, and it's initial price tag isn't that low.  All in all if you are looking for a mid to high priced SUV, this is the way to go!<br><br>
