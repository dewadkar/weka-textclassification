            When I got a new job, I was fortunate to get a company car.  This company car, however, was a minivan....a Dodge Caravan, to be exact.  I wasn't too thrilled with it, I felt it was not solid, and seemed a bit "tinny" when doors were opened and closed.

Well, I got promoted, and they took my van away.  So, my better half wanted to replace the company car with a new van.  we looked all around, From Dodge & co. to Ford Winstar (avoid at all costs) to the Sienna.

We had always liked the Montana since it came out in 1997.  Sporty design and nice features.  We looked into a 2000 Montana, and fell in love with it.  It is well built, and seemed more solid on the road.  Ride was very smooth, and the response was agile.  Plus, the larges standard engine in the Minivan class.

Love the extra features, from the rear air, the Air Compressor is fantastic, and the MontanaVision, although pricey, is well worth it.  Funny...I haven't heard "Are we there yet?"

Removeable seats are easy to take out and put back in, and once out, there is ample room for anything.

I have no complaints, and this is coming from a guy who loves two-doors....never thought I would want to own a Minivan, but this Pontiac is definitely a hit.
