            **** NOTE: these are my initial thoughts on the camera. I DON'T have one yet, although I hope to order one shortly, and I'll write a new review. HOWEVER, check out the url below for a really thorough description/review that I found. ****

When I first bought my Canon Elph APS camera, I remember thinking &quot;I wish this were digital.&quot; The camera was so small, that I could put it in my pocket without messing up the lines of my clothing, and take it anywhere. It also took darn nice pictures. Alas, film isn't cheap, and neither is processing, nor is it particularly convienient, so I found myself restraining from taking as many photo as I wanted.

Well, it appears my wishes have my answered. The Powershot S100 is Canon's new 2.1 megapixel camera, also know as &quot;Digital Elph.&quot; That's right, &quot;Digital&quot; photos, &quot;Elph&quot; body. The body is nearly identical to Canon's newer Elph 2 stainless steel chassis, with the LCD &amp; controls obviously being the difference.

Functionality is similar to the other powershot models, as is the usage of Compact Flash media (Type I only). One notable difference is the use of rechargable Lithium Ion batteries (!). And yes, it uses USB! Zoom is 2x optical, 4x digital. 

While it doesn't have some of the features of other cameras in it's price range, namely 3+ megapixel, video, or uncompressed TIF; it's size, IMHO, makes up for it.

Anyone who has ever been somewhere and thought &quot;I wish I had my camera with me&quot; should take a close look at this camera. And since it's digital, you can shoot to your heart's delight with instant gratification and without breaking your bank. (Of course, the MSRP of $699 is pretty steep, as is the additional investment in a memory card larger than the supplied 8MB, but that's the nature of a digital camera.)
