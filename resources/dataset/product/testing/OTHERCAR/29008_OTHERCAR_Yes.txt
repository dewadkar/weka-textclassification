            I used to sell Hondas, and to be honest these were the easiest to sell (If they didnt complain about the boxy feeling of the drive).  This car has so many fun little features, When I was presenting the car I sometimes would forget to mention them all. Cute little built in picnic table, dual outlets (one in front, one in back) and little containers for all sorts of stuff secretly located all over the place!!
The fact that they included the feature of real time 4wd was pretty cool too. This meant that when the tires werent spinning at the same rate (which usually meant snow rain or mud) then the 4wd would kick in automatically. No knobs to shift, no buttons to press, very convenient.
What didnt impress a lot of people was it felt funny to steer. People who werent used to taller cars would often get in and drive feeling like they were about to tip the car on one side. I never bought one for myself for this reason. I like feeling like I am hugging the ground, its a control thing I guess.
My friend actually bought one just recently though, and many times I have had to drive. It is definitely a lot easier after you drive it a few times. This is something that most people don't do when they are buying cars is test it out a few times, which may sway those picky people away from the CR-v and over to the RAV4. Personally, I think that car needs a makeover, the Cr-v is much nicer overall.<br><br>
