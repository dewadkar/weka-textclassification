            Man, I have to say that the Honda Accord has come a long way into becoming the great car it is now. I remember riding in my friend's '80 something Accord sedan that puffed out white smoke and had hot air blowing up from the front passenger tire that ends up on you when you leave the window down. 

Yep, those were the days when Honda's weren't as popular. But now the Accord has been almost revolutionized. I have to say that riding in a new Accord sedan is like being in a great luxury car. The riding is so smooth you can be cooking in the back without worrying that the oil would spill on you. Okay, that may be a bad metaphor but the Accord is so stable, smooth, and comfortable that you wouldn't even notice you the bumps or dips on the road. The engine is also so silent that you wouldn't know it was turned on if you weren't moving. The sound of the fuel burning is so clean due to the fact that the car is an ULEV (Ultra low emissions vehicle I think), a ultra stringent standard in California.

In all, the new Honda Accord is a revolutionized car that offers one of the quietest and comfortable ride that is comparable to luxury sedans. The car is fuel efficient and at the same time provides power. The front and back seats are very roomy and the interior very stylish. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a not too expensive car that provides great performance and comfort. The people in Honda have come a long way in developing and refining their vehicles to give the public the Honda motor trust.
