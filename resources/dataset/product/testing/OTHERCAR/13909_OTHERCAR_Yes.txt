            Having owned approximately 20 different cars I was pleasantly surprised with my new 2001 Saturn SL1.

I sold a 1991 Oldsmobile 88 because of the current fuel prices and found the Saturn to be substantially better on fuel economy.  

The Saturn is my choice when going on family trips (we own a '98 Malibu as well) since it has adequate room, great on gas and is easy to drive long distances.  The driving position and seats are very comfortable.

The SL1 is a great car for commuters but may be a bit small for families (from personal experience rear facing child seats didn't fit very well).

Some plastic interior pieces didn't fit very well but nothing that is worth writing about.

I have only one annoying complaint regarding the SL1, that being, wind noise!  There seams to be noise generated by the doors or mirrors or trim piece that runs along the roof.

All in all a good little car.
