            I bought my 88 new in 93 and have not been sorry once. It made it through five years of horrible New York roads and now has gone through three years of Arizona heat. After 65000 miles, I just changed the air conditioner compressor. Not bad considering it's over one hundred degrees here so often. Normal wear and tear items but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one and probably will in a couple of years. It certainly can't be referred to as a &quot;Grampsmobile&quot; any longer. One of the few complaints I have would be the paint job. It seems to chip more easily than any other car I've owned. Also I've been unable to maintain a good new car wax job no matter what product I've tried.<br><br>
