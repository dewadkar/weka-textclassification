            We bought our '96 SL new from the dealer; my wife insisted it made her "feel like a princess" when driving it.  Their no-haggle policy made it easy to buy; I didn't even go with her to pick it out.

And over the past five years it's started every time, it goes where we want it to.  That's what a car's for, after all, and it's never let us down.  The gas mileage is nowhere near what I'd expected (I guess we're more city drivers than highway drivers, but still -- I'd hope for more than 26 mpg from a car this size.)  We also bought it for safety, and haven't really put that one to the test, thankfully.  All in all, it's been an okay, if not outstanding, car.

However.

At around 20k miles our automatic transmission developed this massive CLUNK when we put it into reverse, and each time it would kick us in the back so hard it made you see stars.  (It felt like it was taking up slack or something.)  We brought it back to the dealer, and as it was clearly covered by warranty, they replaced it.  Fine.

At just under 40k miles, the CLUNK was back.  A kick in the back so hard I'd almost climb out of the car in fury and kick it back.  This time, however, our 36k warranty was expired, and they wanted to charge us $800.  I made a stink.  I made it very clear I was finding another car and it would NOT be a Saturn, since two transmissions in 39,000 miles was outrageous.  After a lot of struggling the dealer called up Saturn Central and got approval to fix the transmission at no charge.  Fine.

Now we're at 60k miles, and transmission #3 is starting to go clunk.  Not CLUNK, but clunk.  We paid our last payment on the car a couple months ago, and I'm thinking we have GOT to get rid of this dog before the CLUNK comes all the way back....

So -- I don't know if anyone else has had this experience, but if you're looking at used Saturns, make absolutely certain you test the tranny by shifting into Drive, then Reverse, then Drive...  And personally, unless you really love the Saturn, I'd consider something else, something that the guidebooks say is more durable and cost-effective.  Because I'll bet you it won't be long before you're shelling out $800 for a repair that most cars need once in 100,000 miles if that.
