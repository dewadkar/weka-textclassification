            I design websites. If you are interested in checking it out it is www.everspeed.com. Leave me a message on the message board to show me you got there ok=) Alright so this opinion is suppose to be about cameras i thought. Well it is, I need to have models on the site to bring traffic to the site. So this camera is my answer to bringing models. My approach is asking attractive girls on the street if they wouldn't mind me taking pictures for my website. With this in mind do you think I want poor looking pictures on the site.

<i> Ask yourself?</i> 
You think people really want to see crappy pictures on a website. SO i received this camera as a graduation gift and have been loving it ever since. The camera has brought lots of joy to my life. I have been able to take pictures of anybody I see and reeped the benefits that it brings. THe 1.3 megapixels isn't the greatest quality but its not that bad at all. 

The camera has the capability of storing around 30-40 pictures. Depending on the high quality of pictures that you take. Its not that compact so it doesn't take up that much space in my pocket. Other nice features are the index and capabilities it has to check the pictures you have just taken. Other nice features are the auto flash, which is really responsible of when it is suppose to be used. Other nice features are the removable smart media cards. These removable cards are convenient for organization of certain pictures, thats mainly what I use the two i have. 

<b> The ugly:</b> 

There aren't many bad things about this camerea. THough I must admit the lag of pictures is pretty annoying. You take a picture and the camera takes about 4-5 seconds before you can view individually on the camera's lcd screen. The major bug I have about the camera is the lack of zoom. I need a zoom to take further pictures. The camera does not have this capability and that is serious problem for me. Other's who are looking to purchase this camera should take this into consideration.

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b> 

Overall this camera is very awesome. I love all the features about it, it takes good quality pictures and the price is another consideration for me. Around 280 at ecost.com you are getting a bargain for a camera of this caliber. IF you want to take pictures for personal or business use, you shouldn't have any problems.
