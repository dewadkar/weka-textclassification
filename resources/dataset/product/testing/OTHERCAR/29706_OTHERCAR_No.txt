            Let me preface this by saying that my '97 Legacy L sedan was NOT the first Subaru in our family. I sold my '91 legacy L+ sedan to my grandmother who's still driving it today. My mother has a '93 Legacy sedan. Neither have been in the shop for anything other than routine maintenance.  
However, my '97 Legacy was a nightmare from the time I picked it up. I picked it up the Sat. morning of Labor Day weekend. On Sun. night, coming home from the mall, at 211 miles, my check engine light came on. That was just the start of my problems. In the three years I had the car, I had 4 recalls. I constantly had problems with the brakes, having to replace them at 19,000 miles.  The mileage was terrible. I was lucky to get 15 in town and MAYBE 18 highway. The all-wheel drive was a joke. The slightest bit of moisture on the road and it slid all over. The comfort level was zero. Very tinny, very bumpy ride.
My dealer is a whole other ball game which should not appear in this review. Suffice it to say, I will walk before buying another vehicle from them. Subaru of America was also no help and really couldn't be bothered talking to me, never mind helping me in any way. 
The '97 was also a lease thru Subaru of America. READ each and every word on the lease agreement as many times as you can before signing. There is MUCH small print and lots open to interpretation.
Something happened along the way between our Legacies in the early '90s and the late '90s (If I didn't love and trust my '91 I certainly wouldn't be letting my grandmother drive it, not would I have recommended it to my mother.) Maybe I just got a lemon, but it will be a long, long time before I buy another Subaru. My trust has been broken.<br><br>
