            The early 90's were a terrible time (vehicle wise) for my wife and I.  Auto enthusiasts all our life, we were sold into large american sedans and SUV's at the time because of the room and safety.

But that was good in some affect.  Cars like my 1992 Olds 88 royale, which was a dealer demo that was loaded with every option in a gorgeous Midnight metallic blue, were the best fullsizer's you could get at the time.  Front wheel drive and a V6 was different in a crowd of rear wheel drive V8's like the ford crown vic and buick roadmaster (my wife's car at the time), so the 88 kinda seemed like a bigger midsize car, but make no mistake, it had all the solidity of one of the classic fullsize beasts.

The 88 drove well for what it was, it handled well for what it was, and had all the room that was expected.  With 3 young kids, we needed every bit of that car.

This car is tough.  It took major abuse up until its demise in early 1998 with 3 kids.  We shook that car to peices on rough washboard roads, threw it around corners at speeds expected of high priced sports cars, had two 16 year olds learn to drive on it (the most abuse of all :) ), and drove through lots and lots of deep snow in the harsh pennsylvania mountain winters.

But the msot important factor for buynigthis car for us was the safety.  At the time, and still today, 88's/bonnevilles  are tanks.  And unfortunately, unlike my other "safety cars", this one, we got to test the safety features.

In early 1998 my (at the time) 16 year old son was driving home from a basketball game in a snow storm when the car hit a patch of ice, skidded off the road, and hit an apple tree.  The car hit so hard it deployed the airbag (which saved his life), destryoed the front end of the car, and shattered the windshield.  The pure solidity of this vehicle saved his life.  

Seeing the beauty of how this car handled the accident, we soon bought a 1998 Olds Intrigue, but it wasnt the same.  The 88 was  solid, well put together vehicle, and the intrigue is not.  Sure it's got the handling, but when it comes to all american steel, they sure don't build 'em like they used to.
