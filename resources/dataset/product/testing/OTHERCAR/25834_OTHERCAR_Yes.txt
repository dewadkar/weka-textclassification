            I bought Jeeves the Jeep (Cherokee Pioneer) in the spring of 1988. We intended to pull a small trailer all over the US, Canada and Mexico so needed a vehicle that was up to it. The Jeep seemed to fit the bill at $14,000 USD it was a real bargain. It had been repossessed by the bank and was in like new condition throughout with only 13,000 miles on the odometer. It had the famous bullet-proof 6 cylinder, 4 liter in-line engine, a 5 speed manual transmission, manual 4 wheel drive, air conditioning and the tow package consisting of the heavy duty radiator, oil and transmission cooler. I fitted it out with a heavy-duty tow bar, ball and chains and tried on the little 17' trailer. It handled the trailer with aplomb, pulled it easily and accurately. Braking was efficient and Jeeves seemed to not mind the labors at all. We put on some 20 thousand miles pulling that trailer all over the continent. The Jeep never let us down. After we settled down I kept the Jeep at my work car, all I did was change the oil, filter and occasionally the spark plugs. I commuted to work, a distance of 20 miles each way every day, I hauled building supplies and electronic equipment to and fro, it's cargo capacity is simply amazing! I found little need for the 4 wheel drive tho' we did use it seriously 3 times in Mexico dealing in slick mud and deep sand. Rugged ol' Jeeves functioned like a rhino in that situation and got us out of trouble with ease. 

Trouble did visit Jeeves several years ago, a sensor on the flywheel decided to give up the ghost and caused it to not run at all...except intermittently! Great confusion reigned supreme with the dealer changing parts willy-nilly and not accomplishing much. Eventually after the computer was changed and various other ignition parts too I (yes ME!) found the defective sensor and replaced it. This was after 14 days, 3 service visits and $900 in suspect parts but the problem was solved. A couple of years later the rear end developed severe noise at about 80K mile which required it's replacement, a local shop tackled the job and the total cost was under $800US. 

Would I buy it again? You bet! It's a great car, worthy of its lineage. It's very comfortable, the height is not so extreme like some of the newer SUV's but it has it all over my wife's Honda for visibility. Gas mileage has consistently remained at 10-22 mpg no matter what road I'm driving on. Fit and finish are particularly high for a car of that era, the door seals are still tight, there are no air leaks. Rattles? I've never had any, the doors are as tight as the day it was manufactured. Overall I give Jeeves an 8 out of 10 for fulfilling its mission for us.
