            We purchased it for Industrial Hygiene surveys to include Ergonomics.
It is easy to use by a staff of four Industrial Hygienists and has also been used by Environmental Health to document sanitary conditions and to create Powerpoint slide presentations.  It's perfect for Ergonomics and for compliance surveys.  It has the option of creating a mpeg movie to document repetitive motion studies.  It will also record sound and date.  We have also used it to document safety hazards, compliance/non-compliance with safety standards.  To have a visual record of lead and asbestos problems.  We have two of these cameras for our entire Division and are probably going to order another one. Since we purchased our cameras, the housing division has purchased one to document structure conditions and our workers compensation committee uses one to document case studies.  Since we don't have computers with USB ports, we like to be able to use the 3.5 inch diskettes.  We are not too concerned with megapixel quality.  The resolution we have it on is sufficient.  The main option we love about the camera has to be the use of a diskette that is compatible and quick for use in transferring digital pictures to the computer for immediate documentation of findings.  I would highly recommend it for Ergonomists, Industrial Hygienists, Safety personnel, Environmental Compliance and worker's compensation evaluation personnel.<br><br>
