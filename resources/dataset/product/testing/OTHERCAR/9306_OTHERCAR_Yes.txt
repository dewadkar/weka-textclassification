            Well, with the E55 Sedan you get both!  If you are looking for a car with the stunning and eloquent looks of a luxury sedan, but the power and handling of a sports car, look no further, the E55 is the car for you.
We will start with the looks.  What more need I say about this car? Just look at it, it is beautiful.  The headlights are attractive, the car is just pure eyecandy.  Sure doesn't look like a sports car does it?
Next you move on to the performance department.  This car has the handling of a sports car.  Driving in this puppy you will definately feel the precision turning and the immediate reaction of the tires to the wheel.  IN fact, you feel like you could race in the Daytona 500! Another great benefit is the braking.  I first noticed this stopping at a stop sign when I had pulled out of the Ownership.  Without much effort at all the car pulled to an immediate and soundless stop.  You can stop on a dime in this car!  Another great aspect of this car is the acceleration.  While managing to appear to be a luxury sedan, the Mercedes-Benz name does not forfeit any of the power.  Whether you are speeding up from a red light or pulling out of a parking lot, you will enjoy the confindant speed and power this car brings to the road.
On the inside, the car takes you back to the world of a luxury sedan.  leather interior, cd player, beautiful wood finish, everything you could want in a luxury car.  The stereo speaker quality is A+, and everything is conveniently located in the car, whether it is cup holders, speedometer, or just the clock.  The ride in this car is wonderfully quiet, and could even keep an infant asleep.

Bottomline - the perfect combination.  luxury and sport.<br><br>
