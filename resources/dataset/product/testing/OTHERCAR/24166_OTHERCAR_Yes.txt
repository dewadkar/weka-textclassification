            I've had my Z28 for almost 5 years now, and I am still extremely happy with it.

When I first got it, it took a bit getting used to with all the extra horsepower.  After the initial learning curve, the true enjoyment began.

The Z28's engine isn't totally quiet.  It constantly issues forth a low growl of power.  The ride itself is normally quiet and smooth - unless you are on a bumpy road, and then you will definitely feel that sports car suspension.

Over the years I've had but few problems - most notably the air compressor going bad.  Other than that, problems have been relatively minor (tires out of alignment once and a slight rear differential fluid leak).  All in all, I'd say that it is extremely reliable.

Getting into openings in heavy traffic is easy - even with the stick shift.  Just press the accelerator and unleash the beast within the engine and you are just about instantly going at the same speed as the rest of the traffic.

Getting in and out of the vehicle could be a problem if you are not agile enough.  Also, you cannot see the nose of the car (which is kind of irritating).

Also, I've been surprised at the miles per gallon that I have achieved with it.  Several times on the highway I have gotten over 30 miles per gallon, but the norm is in the 20's for highway and 18-20 for city travel.

I wouldn't recommend this car for anyone that is timid in traffic - or someone who is just drives crazy.  They will end up getting themselves and probably others killed.  

Those that are responsible and enjoy having that much power under their control are in for the ride of their lives.<br><br>
