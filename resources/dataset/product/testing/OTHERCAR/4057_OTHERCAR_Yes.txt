            As a former owner of the &quot;dustbuster&quot; series of GM vans (Pontiac Transport) we were excited when GM introduced this updated style.  We have six members in our family so a sedan just would not cut it. The Venture is very flexible as family needs change or for hauling furniture.

Pros:
+  We have seven passenger seating.  It is very easy to remove seats as needed or just fold up out of the way.  We keep the middle seat in the middle row out so the kids can get in and out easier.

+  We also love the power door.  Yes, we were concerned too with kids but they respect that they need to stay out of its way.  This model is supposed to be more sensitive to items stopping it than previous models.  It's great to drop off kids at school when they can jump in and out without having to get the baby out of the car seat.  It is also nice to have redundant switch on overhead panel and lockout feature.  I can assure you we were embarrassed to find that lockout feature.  We thought the door was broken until the service guy at the dealership reached up and turned it back on as soon as we told him our &quot;problem&quot;!

+  Another addition compared to the previous models is the passenger door next to the driver door.  Although our model doesn't have power on this door, it still helps a lot when you have a baby in a car seat.  Once they are forward facing, the driver can see the baby in the rear view mirror and get out attend to the baby quickly from the door.  The front seat passenger can also attend to baby if van is moving down highway at great speeds (the normal time for baby to make himself known!).

+  Other small little conveniences:  power windows in back for ventilation, cargo nets, lots of cup holders, mileage computer (especially &quot;range&quot;--it figures how much further on current tank of gas).

+  The last positive has to be that we no longer hear any of those &quot;dustbuster&quot; wise cracks! (and it is easier to tell where the nose of the van is when driving)

Cons:
-  We did not buy rear heat/air ducts--I highly recommend them!

-  The pop-out window on the passenger side power door is hard for kids to open and shut.

Overall, we highly recommend the Venture.  It has been absolutely no trouble and very well used!
