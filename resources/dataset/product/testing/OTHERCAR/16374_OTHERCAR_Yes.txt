            I liked this camera o lot because it looks and feels great. 
The camera has 3 compression options, so that one can choose between various image qualities. Even on the lowest quality (highest compression ratio), in daylight conditions, the pictures are remarkable. Installing the software that comes with the camera was very easy. 
The camera's memory chip can be directly plugged into an HP picture quality printer so that you can print pictures without having a computer!
BUT, when using the flash, I did not find the images too appealing. If you take the image from too close, they seem to be overexposed, and if you take them from too far, they are underexposed. Also, by default, the camera has the autofocus off and if you set it up to on, the modification will not be saved for the next time. I found this inconvenient.
I had problems with unloading the camera into my computer. When I tried using another computer, everything worked smooth...<br><br>
