            I now believe in love at first sight.  Really.  The first time I drove this car, I fell in love with it.  That took all of five seconds.  This car is beautiful.  Call me vain, but I look great in it!

I have always wanted an Accord.  It is a popular car here in southeastern Virginia.  The LX is the best Accord out there, and I can see why.  Spacious interior, comfortable seating, and fun to drive.  Who could ask for anything more?  It has power steering, brakes, locks and windows.  Equipped with airbags, rear defroster, and air conditioning.  You can't beat that kind of luxury for the price.  I haven't had any problems with it.  Just general maintenance.  I've used the car for various road trips: from here to Pittsburg.  Never with any problems.  

I did get into a wreck in it, but the damage was mainly cosmetic, and easily fixed.  Not very expensive, either.  I have put money into additions to my Accord: tinted windows, spoiler, bigger stereo, but it's all been worth it.  I love every minute I spend in that car.  I highly recommend this car to just about anyone-- especially young, single vain people!  Hondas are solid, dependable cars, and the depreciation value is almost nil.  The Accord is a sound investment, very worthwhile.
Think luxury...but affordable.  <br><br>
