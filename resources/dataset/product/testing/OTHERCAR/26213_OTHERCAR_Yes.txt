            This is a review of a 2001 BMW X5 4.4i.  Here are the options on the test vehicle:

Sport Package
Activity Package
Xenon lights
In-dash CD player
Autodimming inside and outside mirrors
Moonroof
Privacy Glass
Metallic Silver
Black Leather
Dark Wood trim (on steering wheel too)

The total for all this is approx. $55k.  Overseas, it would cost you more like $65k, so consider yourself lucky if you live in the USA as you can obtain this vehicle for a much better value.  Why?

1. Built in the USA (although most major parts are imported from Germany, of course)
2. Competition is fierce for SUV-dom in the USA

This vehicle is a fabulous machine.  The technology and the depth of its engineering are truly incredible.  Let's go in to each piece separately:

---Exterior---
Very very good looking car.  Just the right size, and looks very high-tech and at the same time classy.  Of course, there's that BMW sporty "flair" no matter what angle you look at, and of course the paint is first-rate.  The wheels on the SP for the 4.4 are 19 inch, and they look fab.  Show off the ENORMOUS 13.1 inch front rotors as well (more on those later).

The sport package yields a nicer look by having clear lenses up front and back, as well as some other subtle touches which I think anyone will find more pleasing to the eye.

---Interior---
Typical BMW.  READ: 1st rate quality, fabulous driving position, and very familiar controls.  You can see and feel that things were all designed with a lot of thought process.  The seats on this vehicle were the standard ones, and they are just fine, but I have been told that the sports seats are even better (look cooler too!).  The optional comfort seats have been rated the best seats of ANY car EVER in history for ANY price.  However they are an extra $1200.  There is plenty of space to stretch, especially in the front.  Overall, more spacious than the 5-series.  But the trunk, while very sufficient for the likes of me, might slightly upset others.  It's barely 17 cubic feet, but of course you can fold down the back seats.  17 is big enough for most people!  Gimme a break.  Oh oops...sorry I didn't mean to inject my personal opinion into the review, this is strictly a factual one.  Oh, with sport package you get an alcantra headliner.

The air condition is very effective and powerful.  The sound system is very good, even though I did not try out the premium system, i.e., the standard one is quite good.  I don't think many people will be disappointed with it, contrary to all the postings on the net by people who have become accustomed to 3000W systems.  =)

The car I tried did not have the navigation system, but I've tried it on other cars.  Fact:  it's NOT as good as the Lexus or Acura DVD-based ones.  Period.  However, they recently changed the system, and now it's friendlier to use as well as using a much larger (6.5 inch) screen.  Check it out @ your local dealer...

---Technology---

Are you kidding me?!  Ok, I really can't list everything here for you (believe me I'm aware of it ALL but do yourself a favor and visit both www.bmwusa.com as well as www.bmwworld.com for a heck of a lot of info).  But I'll tell you a little anyhow.

In crash tests this car's been said to be the safest BMW in history, which says a heck of a lot.  The brake SYSTEM (people tend to think brakes systems are equal, just put a larger rotor and new pads and viola mine is as good as yours...err...no) is AWESOME.  Incredible thought went into it, and I'm sure the engineers did all that they could technology-wise for the brake system under the budget constraints.  There are a myriad of driving aids, from very efficient ABS, to CBC, to brake-assist, to automatic AWD, etc.  You can even get heated REAR seats.  There is so much you really should go to the web and check out the literature.  It's really an understatement to say the car is packed with features and technology.

---THE DRIVE---

This is the best SUV (or SUV variant) in the driving dynamics department, bar none.  The steering is nicely weighted (although admittedly it might be too much effort at low speed with those 19 inch tire contact patches on 90 lbs females for example).  The engines are fabulous. The 4.4 emits an awesome sound (well the exhaust system too) and thrusts you in the seat with an authority to always make you smile (boy, keep your foot nailed down after it shifts to 2nd gear from first and you'll see what I mean).  This V8 pulls strongly from as low as 800RPM!  It has no problem producing thrust even at 6000RPM, so you can see it has a wide spread of torque. TRANSLATION: KICK A$$.  The 3.0 inline six, equipped in the X5 3.0, which I test drove, is easily the best 6-cylinder in the world for the price.  It's extremely efficient, sounds AWESOME, has no problem moving the 4500 lbs of weight (the 4.4 is 4800 lbs approx, depending a little on options), and has a very broad torque curve.

The gearing chosen for the 4.4 is near perfect.  The automatic transmission, with sportronic feature, is the best of its kind in my opinion.  Unlike offerings from Audi, Acura, and others, it allows you to select first gear (thank the Lord) and reacts very quick, and holds on to the gear PROPERLY.  Again, you can tell teh engineers fought long and hard to get this right on the sports-end.

The ride is a little stiff for some, but guess what:  I found the X5's (along with any other BMW!) to be BARELY less comfy on rough roads with the sports package than without.  But w/ SP the handling ability is increased three-fold.  Therefore I wholeheartedly recommend the SP.

The X5 4.4 reaches 120, even 140 mph, faster than you would believe.  It is extremely sturdy, extremely stable, and extremely quiet even at triple digit speeds.  The xenon lights are excellent and really illuminate the path for you.  

The handling is fantastic for such a big vehicle.  So utterly composed it's almost unreal.  Those engineers really are wizards.  You can plow into turns at speeds unthinkable in other SUVs (save for maybe the AMG ML55, but even that doesn't feel quite as compliant).  The X5 4.4 with the SP can take the slalom at about 63mph!  That is incredible for a vehicle this heavy and with this high a Center of Gravity (actually it tells you that the COG isn't that high).
Oh, the brakes.  Words are hopelessly inadequate to explain how good they are (unless you drive a Porsche Turbo or something).  AWESOME ability, especially when you remind yourself how heavy the car is.  The feel of the brake pedal, just like on all BMWs, is pretty much the best in the business, save for maybe Porsche (actually I find BMWs better feeling, although the Porsche's are close in return for a little easier modulation of the brake force, essential for such a high perf. machine like a Porsche).  The rotors up front are ENORMOUS (13.1 inches people, only the M5 with 13.6 inches is bigger).  The brake system, which comprises the master brake cylinder, the lines, calipers, the whole SHABANG is just superior to anything else even close to this price range.  Fabulous.

Mileage:  Not that great, but what do you expect from a medium-sized V8 pushing 4800 lbs (plus you, so say 5000 w/o passengers)?  

I think that if you are lucky enough to be driving such a splendid machine, you really don't care if you are getting only 15mpg or whatever, around the city.

---RELIABILITY----

It's only been on the market for about 2.5 years, and the 3.0 X5 has been out for just 1 year, so give it a little more time.  Having said that, keep in mind that all the main parts come from Germany, and of course the engines and drivetrains are shared by other well-established models from BMW, so I wouldn't worry too much about anything.  Besides, you are covered bumper-bumper on EVERYTHING (BMW even covers brake rotors!  You can't find that elsewhere) for 3 years, in addition to FREE scheduled maintenance, which is something that costs people several hundreds of dollars per visit on most luxury cars.

Last, let me mention that when you think about it, you can get a 540i sedan, with the same transmission, the same engine.  The 540i is a lot lighter, better mileage, much better acceleration and cornering ability, and better braking performance.  Plus, a lower center of gravity.  So why get a "compromised" vehicle like the X5?  Well, it certainly isn't for going on the racetrack.  It's stylish in every way, it's roomier, can fit a lot more cargo, it's got AWD, it's got that great presence that people like SUVs for, it's got the latest technology, and it's to some people 2 cars for the price of one.
