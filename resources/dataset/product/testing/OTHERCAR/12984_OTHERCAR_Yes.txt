            I was in the market for a car and stopped by the Kia dealership in my area to look at the Rio. I drove off the lot owning one.

My first impression was that it looked like so many cars out on the road, and the interior is a basic as it gets, but after test driving the car, I was sold.

I've had this car for several months now with no problems. 

Coming out of first gear from a stop is great, and nice acceleration from second gear. The car hums along nicely in third, forth, and fifth gear. I've had the car up to 75 mph with no problems and outside noise isn't a problem.

The warranty is as good as it gets; 10 yr/100,000 mile bumper to bumper with an extension package available.

While it only get 96 horsepower, it has spunk and is a smooth ride. Very little outside noise, idles very quiet, though you can hear the engine as you shift gears. The clutch and stick shift are tight and work well. I'd recommend the power steering and breaks.

While the stereo is a factory model, the sound is clear and better than most factory models. I did upgrade my stereo system and think the car design where the speakers are placed make for a nice surround sound.

The biggest drawback is the backseat, which doesn't leave much leg room, but with small children, it's not a problem. And I found that the cloth interior can be made to look better with a little imagination (seat cover and a car blanket).

Included in my purchase price is a security system and a cd changer, which I traded in for a stereo system.

I'd recommend this car to anyone buying their first car. I get compliments on it all the time!
