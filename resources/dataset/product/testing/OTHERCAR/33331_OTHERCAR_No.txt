            I bought my 1993 Plymouth Grand Voyager in 1995 after it had been used for a mere 2 years.  My parents bought it actually, and I still wonder why they never decided to check up on what everyone else had said about that Minivan?  They probably didn't have a resource such as epinons.com to help them out.  We bought the car used from a friend who had been using it to transport people back and forth from the airport.  It ran fine and was a great relief on those long trips now that we each had a whole row of seats to sleep on.  That's about all I can say about it that's good.

Plain and simply put, I regret every minute that I've had this minivan.  Sure, it's nice and big and comfy, but what good is that when you're stranded on the freeway and your car won't start up?  More than once, the car has either just died on me or wouldn't start.  At first, I thought it was ignitions problems, so I took it to the dealer.  They didn't find anything wrong with it and they told me that there shouldn't be problems anymore.  So, with that peace of mind, I set out on a short 5 hour trip to Las Vegas.  Along the way the car just suddenly died and I was so fortunate that I was close to an exit that I got off and pulled the minivan over.  I gave it a few minutes and I tried starting it up again.  No luck.  I ended up having to leave it overnight at a shop before it would start up again the next morning.  

The minivan has been acting well for the past few months, but recently, it's been acting up again on my parents while I've been away at college.  Now, I'm scared to drive it because I'm sure one of these days, I'll be stranded and I'll have to call AAA to save my pathetic minivan -- once again. So, for all you guys out there looking for a used quality mini-van, this one isn't the right one to choose.  The money that I've spent in the last few years in repairs and maintenance has amounted to so much that I think I would've been better off if I had bought a new minivan.  I've heard many good things though about all the minivans from the Plymouth/Dodge/Chrysler, as long as they're made after 1997.  But after this experience, it's Toyota or Honda all the way in terms of reliability and peace of mind.  <br><br>
