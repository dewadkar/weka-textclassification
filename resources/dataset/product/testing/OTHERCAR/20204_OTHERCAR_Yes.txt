            I love this car.  It has a lot of get up and go and many extras for less than $20,000.  When driving this car you don't have a lot of hesitation, taking off from stoplights or stop signs you don't have to worry about getting into the road.  I also have a Chevrolet Blazer and the pickup in Malibu is much better and faster than the Blazer.

The gas mileage is just terrific also.  When you are scooting along in your Malibu it is like being in a foreign car, without the cost.  The leather interior is soft and you could just lay down in it.

For a good second car to get around in the Malibu cannot be beat.  The only draw back however is with 2 children it is a little cramped to use on road trips of more than 60 miles or so.<br><br>
