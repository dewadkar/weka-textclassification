            I mentioned to a co-worker that I wanted a new car, and my one and only criteria was that it be safe, oh and affordable.  He took me car shopping the next day - I wanted to check out the Ford showroom.  He drove into the Volvo dealership which was across the street from Ford. I thought this was rather odd but I assumed we'd walk across the street. My co-worker suggested I look at a few Volvo's first just for the heck of it.  

Well,I never did make it across the street. I fell in love with a 1996 850 Turbo, not only for it's appearance but I was/am convinced of the superior safety features in this car. Not a bad price either.  

My co-worker told me he knew a Volvo was the right vehicle for me.  He really didn't want to spend the entire day looking at cars so he took me there first. 

The car is very comfortable, solid and has great pickup.  I can, however, feel the road bumps more than I care to. I'd recommend this car to everyone, well, unless the roads they drive on are full of pot holes.  All in all, I love it and by the way, Volvo service is the BEST I've ever experienced.    <br><br>
