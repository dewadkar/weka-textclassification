            This is Chapter II of my Jeep Cherokee experience.  While we have owned three Jeep Cherokee Laredo vehicles, 1988, 1991 and this 1998 model, my husband drives the 1991 model.  He can write his own review if he wants to.  

We purchased this Jeep to replace my 1988 model, which I drove for 10 years and more than 100,000 miles.  Even though I had become weary of some of my old Jeep's mechanical problems, I attributed most of them to age rather than poor workmanship.  I was satisfied enough that I wanted a second Jeep, because I knew from experience that I would not be tired of it, and my love of Jeeps was more than just a passing fancy.

One thing that's very encouraging about this purchase is seeing advertisements for used 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokees that are still amazingly high, some more than $20,000 that have higher mileage than mine does.  The resale value is a wonderful bonus.

Having had prior Jeep buying experience, one decision my husband and I made was to purchase the Grand Cherokee, which has the more rounded lines and is a slightly roomier vehicle, than the boxier style we both enjoyed.

The 1998 Grand model, with the standard Laredo package, is definitely &quot;cushier&quot; than before.  The styling is more sophisticated, and you feel perfectly comfortable taking this vehicle to a formal function when you're decked out in a ball gown.  It's a great chameleon style, uptown or country.  But I felt that way about my old Jeep, too.

Option packages in the price range we wanted included four basic colors:  Deep Slate (I call it black), White, Red, and Gold.  Interior colors were tan and gray.  I chose gray, and the Deep Slate color.  Mine looks just like the picture on this site.  So do millions of others of the same year, but that's fine.

My Grand Cherokee has a 6-cylinder engine, which is what I had before and found more than sufficient for my driving and power needs.  It also has anti-lock brakes, which take some getting used to.  Air bags on the driver's side are standard.

Strangely missing in this model are power seats, while all other options like windows and keyless entry, are electrical.  That's fine with me, fewer things to go wrong.  Exterior mirrors are electrically controlled and easy to navigate, better than in the 1998.  Cruise control is situated on the steering wheel, which is handy and requires less concentration while driving.  

The overhead console has map lights, exterior temperature, compass, mileage efficiency display, and a compartment for sunglasses, still another for your garage door opener.  

There is an extra power outlet, which I use frequently.  The standard AM/FM radio has a cassette player and high-quality speakers of unknown origin that sound wonderful to me, although people in the back seat think they're loud while the driver thinks it's just right.

Gone is the retractable antenna, which is a real plus.  The antenna is up all the time, but attached so that it goes through the car wash easily.

Air conditioning works with speed, even on the hottest days.  The Grand Cherokee also heats quickly when it's cold.  I'm extremely pleased with the heating and cooling efficiency in all seasons.

If you're buying a Grand Cherokee for passenger room, you'll be disappointed.  Five people is the max, like most cars.  

The rear storage area is larger than in the past, and you can choose to fold down just one rear seat instead of the entire bench back for hauling larger loads.  It also has a retractable cover that attaches to the tailgate so you can hide your valuables.

To date, with 32,000 miles, this Jeep has not been back to the dealer for any repair.  It's still smooth as silk, and the paint remains shiny and bright as onyx, unlike the fast wear in the 1988 models.  Integrity of all interior hardware is as good as new.  

Trim packages in the 1998 are very attractive.  Mine has burled-wood looking plastic, and my cell phone casing even matches!  I love having lighted makeup mirrors on both the driver and passenger side.  

Gas mileage is very acceptable on the highway, probably better than 20 MPG.  In the city, it's still around 16 MPG.  The tank holds nearly 30 gallons, and the gas gauge is reliable enough that I've never run dry.

If you're considering buying a used 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, I'll be the first to encourage you to go ahead.  There's a very good chance that it's never needed a serious repair.

The seats are very comfortable, and the velour-like fabric seems to be holding up well and resisting soiling and wear.

You'll enjoy the sophisticated styling, and the fact that you don't have to pay more for some of the small luxuries and conveniences.  Except for the lack of power seats, you have them all here!
