                 I have hesitated to say anything nice about my vehicle in anything above a whisper, let alone put it in black and white in a public forum.  Not so long ago I was in the market for a different car.  My old car was, well, OLD and getting up in mileage.  So right away I was breaking my first law as pertains to anything mechanical:  DON'T GET RID OF WORKING ITEMS!  (i.e. refrigerator, washing machine, CAR)  I had the chance to buy a 1996 Kia Sportage.  It seemed perfect for me, everything I wanted, small car feel, standard trans., room for my kiddies.  I decided to get it.
  
   After this decision,  (mental only- no money had changed hands)  I decided to see what people had to say about them.  QUELLE NIGHTMARE!  Yikes- could they be that bad and still driving down the road?  Just punch in Kia Sportage while online and watch the ugly words flow.  Complaints galore about every aspect of the vehicle.  The only thing that remained unscathed were the "looks".  Enter stage 1) Disbelief.  Stage 2) Defiance.  I bought it anyway.
    
 WHY?  You may well wonder.  I don't know.  I just started thinking that I'm not an incredibly picky person.  To me, good car= starts, runs, arrives at destination.  So far I have not been disappointed and I've had (in a whisper) no mechanical problems.  But, for those more high maintenance than myself I offer the following laundry list of petty complaints.  For starters, the check engine light stays on all the time.  I don't know why and I really don't care.  One of the two latches on the spare tire doesn't work so it rattles all the way down the road.  Noisy!  Also this vehicle is home to the cheesiest cup holder I have ever seen.  It works (or not) by sliding out of the face plate underneath the stereo.  I've already broken mine, so that leaves me little place to store my Coke.  For that matter, there is little place to store anything, up to, and including, a ball point pen.  You'd have to have your hands on backwards to reach anything put in the door compartment.  At the gas station expect to be standing there with the gas cap in your hand as there is no place to put it.  C'mon, KIA , a little plastic attachment ring wouldn't have cut into profits THAT much.  Sounds like I'm complaining doesn't it?
    
 On the upside,  I am driving the type of car I couldn't have otherwise afforded.  It's much easier getting the children in and out of and is fun to drive.  I like the way it drives and handles and it doesn't really go much over 70 mph so I haven't been getting a whole lot of tickets.  The four wheel drive is nice to have and has been useful in heavy rains.  Also, this car burns no oil!  It has never left me stranded (=GOOD CAR) and I'm starting to feel confident in it.  Another plus is that I love having the privacy glass.  Gas mileage is what you'd expect from a small SUV, around 22 m.p.g.  The cargo area is plenty for what I need, and the back seats can fold down if the kiddies aren't sitting there.  I'm not sure I would be as pleased if I purchased this new, but used at $5700, I am pleased.
