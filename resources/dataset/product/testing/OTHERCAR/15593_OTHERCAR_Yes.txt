             I started out in photography when I was a kid with one of those $14.95 cameras that used 126mm film. From there I progressed to (cheap) 35mm, then to (expensive) 35mm and, with a modestly price Ricoh, digital photography.

The Ricoh didn't offer much, as it was one of the first of their models on the market. When Best Buy started carrying the Sony FD91, it was love at first sight.

It's not that this camera has everything. What I love the most about it is that it has the touch, feel and shape of a 35mm SLR. I feel like I am using a camera, not a throw-away party camera. It is feature rich, durable and flexible.

One of this camera's strongest assets is the optical zoom lens. The key word here is OPTICAL zoom. Digital zoom does nothing more than magnify the image you see electronically, interpolating the image and giving you results based upon an algorithm. What does this have to do with real photography? The optical zoom gives you what YOU see, only larger. Digital zoom has no business being associated with good photography.

This camera also features dual viewfinders. For those wishing to keep the camera at waist level, see yourself in the picture, etc., there is the LCD screen on the back. This screen flips out and up, rotating as much as 180 degrees. As it rotates past 90 degrees, the image automatically flips top-to-bottom, so that you don't have to view yourself upside down. The other viewfinder mimics the TTL (Through-the-Lens) viewfinders of SLR cameras and comes in handy in bright, sunny conditions. This mode is also a super battery saver, almost doubling the useful life of the Lithium Ion battery.

The one thing I don't like about this camera has to do with the thing I love most about it... the optical zoom. The location and operation of the zoom switch is wrong, wrong, wrong. First of all, I feel that the switch should be wired so that pushing it up zooms in, not out. Also, the switch is located on the lens barrel, making it awkward to activate.

The onboard flash is weak, as is the case of most every digital camera. But the low light sensitivity of the CCD chip makes pictures in dim light come out surprisingly well. Resolution does suffer, though. A hotshoe that would allow the use of third-party and/or off-camera flash units would be beneficial.

Another nice feature that will hopefully find it's way to the next generation FD camera is the ability to self-time MPEG movies.

Battery life is more than adequate, but I highly recommend getting the larger capacity battery and keeping the supplied original as a spare. The menus are intuitive, and all other functions and controls are easily manipulated.

A word to those considering buying ANY digital camera... buy a protector for the LCD screen FIRST THING, BEFORE you scratch it or impregnate it with oil from your hands or face. Also, a clear or UV Haze filter to protect your lens is a good idea if you plan on keeping the camera more than a couple of years
