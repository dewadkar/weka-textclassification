            ***UPDATED REPORT***

I bought a dark steel gray Z3 2.5 with steptronic transmission and premium package.  I got the Dinan cold-air intake and software upgrades.  I also got the matching hardtop for winter driving that I regret buying, but more on that later. Although I am very happy with this car, for reasons I will describe below, I now wish that I had looked more closely at Mercedes-Benz SLK and Audi TT Quattro.  

Engine Performance
The performance, even in the base 2.5 Z3, is wonderful.  There is nothing quite like the smooth sound and feel of BMW's superb inline six.  Although the base 2.5 provides more than sufficient power for most, I would recommend the 3.0 for those who can afford it because the increased power is very noticeable in this light car.  I got Dinan cold air intake and software upgrades that increased the horsepower to about 196.  In hindsight, however, buying the 225 hp 3.0 model would probably have been the better way to go.  After all, when it comes to sports car, you can't really have too much horsepower.

Handling
The steering and handling is typical BMW: linear, sharp and very limited body rolls on sharp turns.  The ride provides an almost magical balance between sporty stiffness and comfort but for full disclosure, I must also note that my wife finds the ride too harsh.  Overall, driving a Z3 on winding roads with the top down on a sunny, breezy day is almost a religious experience.

Transmission
The steptronic transmission works very well.  The manual mode works much better than expected in terms of giving a sporty feel to your driving experience.  It will hold the gears in place very well even during aggressive driving.  Of course, there is no substitute for a manual but my wife wanted the convenience of an automatic and refused to give in on this point.  If you want sportiness but need or want the convenience of an automatic, the BMW steptronic is one of the best manumatics out there.

Styling
The exterior styling of Z3 is still a head-turner and in my opinion, it is much sexier than any convertible in its class.  It definitely an attention-getter and people always tell me how great the car looks and ask questions about the car.  Every time I look at this car, I feel like driving it.  It is certainly much pleasant than the Bangle-mangled-odd-lines-everywhere styling of the upcoming Z4.

Safety
Z3 is one of the safest roadsters out there.  It has strong anti-roll bars behind each seat, electronic stability control system, traction control, ABS, front and side air bags for both seats. Also, the BMW safety-cell construction heritage is part of Z3 and I read numerous reports of Z3 owners surviving terrible crashes relatively unscathed.  However, it doesn't have side curtain head protection airbags that Volvo convertible and the upcoming Audi A4 have.  Also, at the end of the day, it is still a light, two-seat roadster.  The best way to be safe on this car is to drive alertly, carefully and defensively, especially when driving near SUVs, minivans and other trucks and vans.

Mechanical quality
Mechanical reliability has been superb so far (but see the interior quality problems below).

Interior quality
The design of the interior is generally classy but the interior quality does not match the price of the car. Also, I had plastic parts and wires that stuck out of place and heard unpleasant rattling sounds coming out of the passenger seat area.  These problems were minor trim problems and did not prevent me from driving the car but I was nonetheless disappointed given the premium that BMW charges for their cars.  Also, the wood trim from the premium package is impossibly shiny and the quality of the leather is not as high as it should be given the car's high price.  Generally, interior materials are not even close in terms of luxury and quality to those in an SLK or Audi TT.  

Space
This is a roadster, which means that space is generally a scarce commodity.  However, there is plenty of legroom and shoulder room for both the driver and the passenger.  Even the headroom with the top up is generous compared to some of the other convertibles out there.  The trunk space is adequate for luggage for two people but you can pretty much forget about large suitcases or regular-sized shopping carts.  Also the glove compartment is negligible (it won't even accommodate the leather ownership manual case that BMW gives you).  There is no armrest in the middle and the storage space in that area is laughably lacking.

Luxury and creature comforts
For a roadster, even the base Z3 is generally well equipped but compared to the competition, it isn't what it should be. The seats are very supportive and fairly comfortable but they are not designed for trips longer than a few hours and you will feel pretty tired after long trips. The standard CD player is fairly good but it doesn't have certain features such as memory playback and recently, I have been having an annoying problem with the subwoofer (it produces an unpleasant strong and noisy shaking on the passenger seat side that quickly becomes bothersome when the passenger seat is not used).  Also, there is no cassette player with the standard CD player system. Since even Mazda Miatas offer CD changer and cassette players as part of their premium packages, it is shameful that BMW doesn't do the same with their premium package.  Also, Navigation system is not even an option for Z3 owners even though it is offered to all others.  

Lack of Rear Glass Window: One major gripe that I have is that it is almost embarrassing that this car does not have rear glass window, even as an option.  Less expensive cars like Miata and S2000 have them and for a good reason: in bad weather or during humid days and nights, the plastic window quickly cuts down the car's rear visibility. On cold but humid mornings, the plastic window becomes a nightmare since it gets fogged up quickly and the only way to avoid it is by leaving your windows open or turning on the A/C.  Also, you can't use ice scrapers on the plastic, which means that on icy cold winter mornings, you simply have to wait for the heater to melt the ice accumulation.  The new Z4 will have rear glass windows. 

Winter driving
This car should not be used as a winter car in areas with heavy and frequent snowfalls unless you plan to invest in winter tires.  The combination of standard tires and rear wheel drive make driving in snow nearly impossible, despite the car's capable vehicle skid control system and traction control.  I have had no problems on wet and mild icy roads but I literally could not get this car to move in heavy snow.  I have heard that good winter tires make driving Z3 in heavy snow possible but I cannot confirm this personally.  Also, the front and side glass windows get fogged up very easily and the defogger is absolutely terrible because you need to carefully tweak the temperature setting to make the defogger work effectively.  For instance, in cold weather, there were numerous times when I had to keep the temperature of the defogger very low (to match the outside temperature) in order for the defogger to work.  This was not fun given the weather situation.

Hardtop
I bought the matching hardtop ($2,500 option) for winter driving but this is not a very elegant solution when compared to Mercedes SLK's hardtop because (1) you need two people to put and remove this thing unless you want to risk scratching the paint in the area around the base of the hardtop, (2) you need a significant amount of storage space to store the hardtop when you don't use it, (3) the wind noise actually increases with the hardtop, (4) it does not always fit perfectly (it took my dealer four attempts to fit it properly) and (5) you are stuck with the hardtop until you remove it, which means that you don't really have a convertible until then.  Unless you live in an area with heavy and frequent snowfalls, you shouldn't buy the hardtop.

Would I buy it again?
Despite the problems and inconveniences listed above, I must rate my overall experience with Z3 as very positive.  This is a true sports car in every sense of the word and  I truly enjoy driving this car.  However, I do wish that I had looked at Mercedes SLK a bit more closely.  I dismissed SLK at the time I purchased my Z3 because it was significantly more expensive and the base version did not offer the same level of performance as Z3. Also, I didn't think, and still don't think, that it looks as sexy as a Z3.  However, I now think that the benefits of a folding hardtop, rear glass window and better snow driving performance (a friend of mine has an SLK and it drives much better than a Z3 in the snow even without snow tires) make the investment of the additional $5,000 or so a much more compelling proposition, especially given the SLK's significantly higher resale value.  In fact, if you add the cost of the Z3 hardtop, the price difference become much less significant.  Also, I was much more impressed with the overall quality of the interior in a Mercedes SLK when compared to the interior of a Z3.  In fact, even an Audi TT Quattro would have been a better choice (rear glass window and better snow driving performance).  On the other hand, there is just something about BMW inline sixes and chassis...
