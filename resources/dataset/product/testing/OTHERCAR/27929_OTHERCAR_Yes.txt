            My 1997 540 was always in the shop. Dealer service and treatment was horrible. I never thought of Lexus or any other Asian manufacturer, but with Consumer Reports and JD Powers giving Lexus the #1 award for every single year and BMW always getting 7-13 place, I figure I would give it a try. I have not been dissappointed. Quicker than my BMW 540, much better braking, superb interior. The navigation is awesome. Has the whole US on it and has touch screen capability. Reliability is certainly "Lexus". No issues whatsoever. Not even the little nagging problems that BMW owners typically "deal" with. Get in, turn the key, and drive. No worries,ever.
This car is fast. Popular Science says the Lexus V8 is the best V8 in the world, and I cannot deny this.
The brakes are incredible. Stops shorter than 99.9% of all cars according to Car Driver and Road Track. Just plain awesome.
The HID headlights are trick. When turned on,they scan up,scan down and level off. Very very impressive to bystanders to watch your headlights level.
Do not buy if you do not like attention. I am still getting at least 5 "nice car" a month from strangers.
