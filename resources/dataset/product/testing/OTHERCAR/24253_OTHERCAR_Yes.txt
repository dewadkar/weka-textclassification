            	I have been driving a Mitsubishi Montero 2000 Limited 2WD since November 1999 and here's what I think.  I first got interested in the Montero when my boss let me drive his on the way home from a seminar.  Before this, I had a deep prejudice against SUV's with the mindset that they were just overpriced trucks with a shell and they drink gas like Michael Jordan drinks Gatorade.  But after driving one myself, I could understand why everyone and their moms are buying SUVs.  You get the high horse view of the road and there's a feeling of invincibility: &quot;there isn't any road or mountain I can't tackle&quot;.

  Inspired, I quickly did research on the latest SUVs.  I narrowed it down to the Montero and the 4Runner. The Montero is not as the popular as the Toyota 4Runner but I think it's a better value.  The Limited Montero has more horsepower than the 4Runner Limited (200hp vs. 183hp). Note: the other models of the Montero Sport have a 173 hp engine. They have basically the same dimensions in terms of overall size and interior room.  The big difference of the two is price.  Since the 4Runner has a higher profile and and a high resale value, its price is several thousand more than the Montero.  Since I did not want to drive something that everyone else is sporting and had no intention of selling my SUV once I got it, the Montero looked like a clear-cut winner.  I think the Montero Limited looked better than the 4Runner to boot.  But the cherry on top was the finance plan  that Mitsubishi is running on all their vehicles.  If you qualify, i.e. have very good credit, you don't have to pay a penny until January 2001.  In other words, you can drive around in a new car for free!

	There are two features that the 4Runner Limited has that I wish came in the Montero.  The AM/FM, cassette player/ CD all-in-one system and the rear window that rolls down.  The Infinity CD player (standard in the Limited) that I have sounds excellent but sometimes I yearn to listen to those old tapes.

	The ride is very quiet compared to other SUVs.  You can barely hear if the engine is on.  The handling is what you expect--truck-like.  The engine is fine but they could always add more horsepower (it would help on those steep grades).  This truck averages about 17 miles per gallon, outrageous for a car but standard for a SUV.

	The interior design is functional but rather vanilla. This goes for the instrumentation.  I do like the rear-view mirror that has the temperature and a digital compass display.  Great for those who have no sense of direction.  There are these storage compartments in the trunk that you can flip over and turn into a mini picnic table.  The leather seats feel good no matter what time of year especially in the winter since the front seats are heated.
	
	The exterior is eye catching.  Not too boxy (like a Land Rover)but not too round (like the Lexus RX 300).  For the Limited, the door handles and mirrors are color-keyed.  The truck is one solid color as opposed to other models of the Montero that have the two-tone scheme.

	The Montero Sport Limited is a smart choice for those who want the power to tackle any adventure and look good at the same time. It is not recommended for those who want that car-like feel and handling.  If you want that, get a car. If you want more room, take a look at the Durango or Montero 2001 (totally redesigned---it looks awesome!).  It is comparable to a 4Runner but a few thousand cheaper.<br><br>
