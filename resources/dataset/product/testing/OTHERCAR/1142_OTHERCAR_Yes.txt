            I used to rent cars for business in the 95-97 time period and they were always Dodge Neons. Then for a couple years the neon was scarce. I assume it was due to their poor reliability but for whatever reason they are back and at least they look better. 

Being in the market for a new 4 door car I scrutinized the dodge neon when I got it from Dollar Rent a car. Of course I was bringing back a Daewoo Nubira that I had rented a few hours before that was just horrible and was shaking unconrolably at 55 mph. So then they gave me the neon. What a difference. For the size this car is roomy. And I am 6'3&quot;. I fit in fine. And the seats are firm and comfortable.

Pickup is swift but noisy. This engine is fast but the automatic transmission will downshift alot at highway speeds and is very loud when it does! 

Ride is firm and tight. Handling is excellent. Radio is good and a/c is strong. The controls for the a/c on this car are pretty unique but easy to understand. Unlike most Chryslers where you get an a/c button. This uses the fan settings to the left for a/c air and the ones to the right for normal air. 

There were a few problems....  Noises, specifially rattles and wind noise at highway speeds like the windows were not completely sealed. 

Interior room is good but getting in and out is a chore with the small doors. Cup holders under dash are hard to access. 

All in all this is a very well designed car and for the price I think I would buy it. I passed it up however holding out for a mid size rather than a compact. <br><br>
