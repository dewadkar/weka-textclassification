            Coming from a family of six means having a vehicle large enough to hold at least that many. It helps to have a little bit of extra space just for comfort, especially on extended road trips. Be forewarned, however, if you don't have to carry several people in your car at once, this is definitely NOT the one for you.

We bought our 1993 Suburban used in 1996. It was just great to have a vehicle that would transport large numbers of people with a little class, not to mention a certain attitude that comes from having a larger machine than other patrons of the road. This was our upgrade from an old Chevrolet Station Wagon. 

The car is still running, but many aspects of the car are mediocre at best. The air conditioning unit has been replaced more than once since we bought it. The transmission has been worked on, and the brakes are not very reliable. It has about 170, 000 miles on it, so certain driving difficulties are expected. 

Despite these problems, if you are looking for a vehicle with plenty of room, then the Suburban is calling your name. Newer models are of course more stylish and in better condition, but they also cost about thirty thousand dollars more than a used 1993 model. It can seat seven people comfortably, and you could certainly squeeze in eight. Even with all these passengers, there is an enormous storage area behind the seats. If you don't have passengers, the back seats fold down to extend the storage all the way to the front. I would definitely recommend the Suburban over other eight seat SUVs simply because of the greater leg room. If you are looking for comfort and passenger room, then your best choices would be the Suburban or a School Bus.

Having room comes with a price. In the case of the Suburban you pay for comfort with acceleration, speed, and maneuverability. Do NOT parallel park this thing except in emergencies. It is hard to take tight turns and park in any situation. If you're a young guy that wants to fly off the mark at a red light, don't drive this. It's also good to break a LONG time before you get to stops.

If you don't mind conceding a few sporty features, and you need to carry lots of people, then  certainly recommend the 1993 Chevy Suburban.<br><br>
