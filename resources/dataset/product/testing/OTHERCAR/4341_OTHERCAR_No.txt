            GMC Savana G2500 is touted as a 3/4 ton cargo van.  It was sold to me as an upgrade from the half ton cargo van in order to meet the extra demands of a contractor.  This was my fifth GMC 3/4 ton van, I currently own four. The ergonomics of the van are quickly apparent with a comfortable and quiet ride.  GM has certainly improved the comfort level dramaticlly in the last 8 years.  The dash is convenient and all instruments are clear.  <br>The new vortec series engines are the real reason I bought my first brand new work van.  My friends at the GM plant here in St Catharines gave me the inside scoop on all the improvements made inside the engine.  The MPG and power are both big improvements from any engine previous to 1996.  I am very pleased with the engine performance.  <br>Previous models had a bad habit of needing new transmissions every 100,000 to 150,000 miles. Which was a bit premature.  I am assured I will get a longer life from this transmission, time will tell.  Currently I have 50,000 miles with no engine or transmission trouble at all.<br>However, my major complaint and the complaint of my peers is the reduction in contractor quality.  Specifically the brakes, body, and rear door.  <br>The front pads will need to be changed every 12,500 miles.  The rear shoes need adjustment every 6,000 miles.  Every Savana 3/4 ton owner I have talked to has the same problem.  The pads should last twice as long.  These are GM Ac Delco long life pads,  the longest life available.  Very poor.<br>The sheet metal on the body is very thin and a word of caution to contractors - make sure you line the interior in such a way so that nothing comes in contact with the interior wall of the exterior.  I personally had a pair of rubber boots hanging by a bungee cord.  From swinging and hitting the exterior wall, the boots have created &quot;pings&quot; in my body.  It looks as if I have taken a ball pein hammer and dented out my body from the inside.  I have seen the same on other vans.  <br>The rear door is a real problem.  The opening mechanism on the driver side rear door is subject to failure due to poor design.  I have talked to fifteen other owners with the same problem, all within the first two years of ownership.  When you first look at the van, the door mechanism seems like a great idea.  It certainly is more convenient than the previous design.  However, it breaks prematurely.  On the plus side, the doors open a full 180 which is very convenient.  <br>Overall, the Savana 2500 is a good van.  However, I would not buy one again, nor recommend one to a contractor.  I would say step up to the 1 ton.  This will improve towing capacity and the braking system.  The rear door and the thin sheet metal on the body will still have to be addressed.<br><br><br>
