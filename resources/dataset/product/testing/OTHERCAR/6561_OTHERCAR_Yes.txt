            I just purchased my 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan and already love it. The ride  is smooth and quiet both on the highway and on rough backcountry roads.  This van handles better than most cars I've driven - my wife says it could almost put her to sleep.

With 4 children there is plenty of room for carseats (2) and the kids are spread out. There is an enormous amount of room behind the rear seat.  The passenger middle seat easily leans way forward for putting kids in the back seat, however the seat behind the driver does not.

The Infinity stereo with CD changer has exceptional sound quality and the A/C is near freezing when you want it to be.

The gas mileage is about average for minivans - 25-27 mpg on the highway.

Anyone with a large family who isn't ready for the &quot;station wagon&quot; look should consider this vehicle.<br><br>
