            I bought this vehicle for 2 reasons:  1. my lease was up on my existing car, and 2. i've always wanted a blazer.  I enjoy driving this SUV especially for the ease of handling, and roominess of the driver area.  This SUV also came equipped with OnStar, the employees that I have talked to there are also very friendly and happy to assist with whatever questions or concerns you have.  This should be the vehicle of choice for first time buyers (the 0.0% was enough to convince me), as well as for a quality second vehicle, which I believe will soon become your primary vehicle.  The 2000 Blazer is a comfortable, quiet ride, with the speed compensated volume of the stereo to the peaceful tranquility of the sunroof.  <br><br>
