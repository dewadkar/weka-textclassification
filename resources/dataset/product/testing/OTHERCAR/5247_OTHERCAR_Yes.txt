            Jaguar S-Type 2002 

A Ford Product.... 

...And it is starting to show. Not that anything is terribly wrong with Ford cars, I have owned several and for the most part I have been very satisfied with them. 

It is just that once you have taken place behind the wheel of the S-type and that the amazement is starting to dissipate, you start noticing some little details that strangely looks like they belong in a Ford. 

Of course if it not were for this giant automobile manufacturer, maybe today there would not even be any Jaguars on the road. So lets turn the page and see 
what we have. 

My wife and I rented a Jaguar from Celebrity Car Rental for a romantic weekend in Las Vegas. We knew it was going to be one of our last trips in Sin City for a while and we wanted to spoil ourselves. 

The selection of exotic cars to rent at Celebrity is fantastic. You can select an Excalibur, or a Lamborghini, a Bentley, or an antique Rolls Royce and many other less exotic cars but still in the fantasia category are available. 

We wanted class and beauty, then what else than a Jag. 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

There were 2 to choose from, one was red and the other green, we both agreed to go for the green one, we felt that the color scheme with the tan interior was nicer than the red one. Beside that the red one was almost double the cost per day simply because it was a V-8 instead of V-6. 

Looking at this Jaguar you can not help but to notice well the elegant retro look mixes with the modern lines of the exterior. I believe that only Jaguar has mastered the ability to do this and make fit as if the modern and the retro belong together. 

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

The interior: 

First thing I noticed is one does not climb in a Jaguar, ones slides in. The seats a very low and they are also very narrow, if you are looking for seating comfort, you might have to look somewhere else especially if you are planning to use it on long trips. 

All weekend long I tried to find a seat position that I 
would be comfortable in and never did find one, I always felt I had to sit on the edge of the seat. 

Well after sliding in, I felt the amazement of this beautiful interior. As I was really impressed by the classy maple wood trims and the fine leather covering the dashboard and the door panels, something familiar caught my eyes. 

Hold on its impossible the last time I sat in a Jaguar, was in 1973, when as a police officer we arrested a teenager that was going for a joy ride in his neighbors Jaguar. 

Ah! Yes now I know it is the turn signal. The first Ford like accessory, the turn signal looks like the one you would find in a Ford Focus. 

Just a few days earlier, we had visited my daughter in San Diego and showed us her new Focus; of course she let her dad drive it around town. 

I wonder if I would have noticed if it had been more than a week since I sat in a Focus. Now I am not saying they are the same, but they sure look alike. 

The car we rented had a voice activated command computer, this system allows the driver to turn on accessories or adjust the air conditioning while driving and keeping your eyes on the road. 

Great idea, but in the car I rented it was not working well, some commands did not work properly. This could be to the fact that others who rented the car before us may have messed it up. 

As a whole once the excitement of sitting in a new Jag wears off, you may feel a bit disappointed, more so if you are looking for comfort. 

The exterior: 

It is the exterior of this luxurious automobile that is most striking. As I wrote in my introduction, very few car manufacturers can do as well as Jaguar when mixing the modern with the retro. 

Just by looking at the grill and the headlights of this car, it bring back souvenirs of long ago, but spend a little 
more time admiring the lines of the Jaguar and you will see that it is a sleek and modern silhouette. 

How they do it year after year, I guess this is trade secret that only Jag engineers know and I bet they keep this secret under lock and key. 

The only thing I did not like too much about the exterior of the Jaguar is the very small trunk space available. You have the option of lowering the back of the rear seats but to make more room in the trunk then you loose your Jag just 
became a two seater. 

I have also mentioned earlier that Ford is starting to leave its mark is this car. The next place I noticed a very close resemblance to a Ford is with the engine. The motor has some strong resemblance to a V-6 Ford Duratec engine. 

THE ROAD TEST 

I drove the Jaguar S-type for almost 21/2 days in and around Las Vegas. Most of my driving was within the city limit but I did have the opportunity to take it on the highway. 

A friend of ours from Dallas who had met us there is an old Jaguar connoisseur. He drove it several times during the weekend and is remark were. �This is a fine car, but it is not a Jaguar anymore.� 

Well I did not say this to him but I have heard the same lines from Jaguar owners ever since I met the first one. 

I enjoyed driving the S-type, maybe my expectations were not as high but I had a great time doing it. 

OK! So maybe because it was a V-6 I was not always the first one at the next red light, but then in Vegas who care anyway.
