            2nd review.

We got the ES 2 weeks ago as a replacement for a leased neon. The car is excellent. It has alot of interior space, one of the largest interiors in its class. nice acceleration and handling. I wanted to get the ES over the LX because of the engine and tires. I let my wife drive both cars (I drove both before and she only drove the LX on a previous drive). after testing the ES, the LX seemed slow by comparison to her. If you can get the ES, go for it...  below are some thoughts from a previous test drive I did on the ES. its still pretty much accurate.

Mazda Protege ES 
Interior. 
Front seats very supportive. Nice open feel to it. Nice views around looking out. Rear seats were more firm and
harder (than LX). The seat bottom isn't as molded to a person's &quot;behind&quot; than other cars and the seat back was more
straight up and firm. I like the layout of the dash and controls. the AC fan level was fairly small, but not enough to
make a difference. Sitting in the back with the front how I liked it, there was ample room. Knees barely touched the
front seat back, but then again, I am long legged. Nice interior fit.

Exterior. 
Nice Styling. nice tires big for a car its sized. 

Drive. 
Excellent acceleration. better than the LX. Not noisy at all if i ask for power. Emits a nice low throaty growl when I step on the gas and accelerates quickly. Good brakes, and nice control in corners with the tires. nice grip to them.<br><br>
