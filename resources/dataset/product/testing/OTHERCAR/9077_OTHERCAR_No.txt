            My husband and I just bought our first brand new car in July 1999.  We were so excited going out and shopping, looking for the best for the amount we could afford.  I've heard some good things about Kia and they're in a good price range.  Ours cost about 15.

  We went to the local Kia dealer in our area.  We took the car for a few days and it seemed to be ok.  We bought it (actually are financing).  We have had nothing but problems with this car since day one.  I'm talking a real lemon.  It's a soft top two door, cute little car. But if you have a family it's not very practical. 

 We've had to get new breaks already, it burns oil like you would not believe, surprisingly it stinks on gas.  We do a lot of long distance driving and have noticed it doesn't get very good pickup.  We've been left in the dust by some really old clunky cars.  

What else could I say?  The warranty pays for the problems, but still we buy a new car to avoid &quot;problems&quot;.  I would recommend to someone thinking of getting a sportage to  really think about what you could be getting.  Just really shop around first.  I know I'd never buy one again.<br><br>
