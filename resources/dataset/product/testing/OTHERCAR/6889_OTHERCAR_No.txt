            Around my 17th birthday, my parents decided that they would shell out $5500 to get me a car they thought would be dependable.  Our car of choice was a 1990 Toyota Corolla, only 7 years old at this point and sporting about 85,000, we figured it would be a good investment for the price.  I mean heck, it's a Toyota... right?  Wrong.

4 years and about 5,000 later, I am still the not-so-proud owner of a 1990 Toyota Corolla, complete with a brand new automatic transmission, 3 new axels, new brakes, struts, and just about every other part you can think of.  Not to mention the head gasket and all the belts are almost shot.  At this point, I am in the process of getting a new car, and thank god getting rid of this Gold Nightmare.  

I started to suspect problems when after the second yearly inspection, we were told a new axel was needed.  For some reason the one on the car was bent, and was causing transmission fluid to leak.  One thing let to another and we were faced with dropping a new transmission in the car, along with another new axel.  At the next inspection, the consensus was that one more ride in the car with the condition of the breaks would send me careening off a cliff somewhere.  So much for the "dependability" of a Toyota.  

I would at this point, care never to own, drive, or look at another Toyota in my life.  While this one got me by for 5 years, it has nickel-and-dimed me to death.  I don't know if is a fluke or what but my experience with this car has been less than pleasant.
