            My 1993 SL2 was my first new car.  When Saturn went into production, I said that I would buy one when I was able and I did.  I actually plunked down my $100 deposit to order my car before I ever even test-drove one.

I ordered mine with A/C, CD, 5 speed, cruise control, Teardrop wheels and foglamps.  it's blue-black with a blue interior.  It had 10 miles on the odometer when I drove it off the lot and as of today has 165,300 miles.  I bought it in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (where I grew up).

I bought a Saturn because I am very patriotic.  I vowed never to buy a foreign car (and I've been laughed at because of that, too).  Most of the people that laughed have already tired of their imports and traded them in.

I'll begin with what I hate about the car.  It'll take less time.  I hate not having cup holders.  But I've learned to improvise.  I hate the plastic dash pad.  It cracked about a year and a half ago.  I managed to find one online at a Saturn junk yard.  If you need parts for a Saturn, check them out at www.saturnusedparts.com.  They have good stuff at good prices.  They are located in South Florida.

What I love about the car is it's durability.  Sure, things have worn out on the car, but if you ever drove on the south Louisiana roads, you'd expect that of any car there.  I've had the alternator replaced twice, but it's never, EVER left me stranded.  After nearly 165k miles on it, the starter began to go sour recently.  I replaced that myself and the car keeps on going.  I love the way the car has become one with me.  I know it like the back of my hand.

I REALLY love the polymer panels on the car.  After my wife and I moved to Tennessee, we were backed into in a parking lot while driving along.  The paint suffered some light scratches, but the body still looks good.  Everything popped right back out into place.

Even after nearly 8 years, the shape of the car still looks wonderful to me.  I think it's prettier than later Saturns (1995-1999).  The new 2000 model is once again a sporty-looking car.

It pains me to say that I'll probably have to buy something besides a Saturn when we decide to get a bigger car.  My wife has an Accord (I'll take my SL2 over it any day) and wants something bigger.  The L-series doesn't fit that.  We'll probably look into a Chevrolet Impala.  I'm looking forward to the introduction of the Saturn sport-ute in October.  We might consider that.

Who should buy this vehicle?  Anyone who wants an inexpensive used car that's undervalued.  I bet we'd get more for my wife's Honda than for my Saturn even though the Saturn is in better shape.  I know this for a fact...I've worked on both cars.  And it's a shame that it's that way.  There is a misconception that all foreign cars are superior.

If you want to work on a car yourself to save money, the SL2 is fairly easy to work on.

You should not buy this vehicle if you have 2 or more kids.  NO room for their necessities.

I've been quite pleased with my SL2.  I know there will come a day when I have to part with it, but I will miss it when that day comes.<br><br>
