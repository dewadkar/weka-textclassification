            Bought my 2000 2.7L 4x4 new  without even a test drive. The reputation for reliability & durability sold me. I don't go off road much but  4WD is a must in the snow. The fit & finish inside & out is light years ahead of the domestics.It get's about 24 mpg. city, a little better on the highway. I have the standard 225/75/15 tires on alloy rims which I imagine offer lower rolling resistance than the larger,optional tires. I have an after-market tonneau cover as well as bed-liner. No complaints after 1 1/2 yrs. Oil changes are easy to do. I had no want nor need for a V6/V8. This truck is used primarily as a daily driver to & from work with the occasional load of  furniture,appliances,firewood,mulch,etc. The thing I appreciate as an enthusiast, who traded a 1990 Eagle Talon TSI AWD sports coupe for this truck is the practicality of it. No matter how hard  it  works, after I wash it ,the black paint job could put Cadillac to shame. I'm not a Cadillac basher, I have a restored 1967 Eldorado. I'm amazed at the state of compact pick-ups in 2000. PS,PB.PW,PL,CD,AC dual airbags ,etc. All of these were unheard of a few years ago in a truck. I know Toyota charges a premium price , but as with Mercedes you get it back at the other end. Look at the want ads, there are not many for sale as owners tend to hang on to them.  My friends say I could have bought a Chevy/Dodge/Ford with a V6 for about the same money. Maybe true, but I did'nt want a 40 yr.old pushrod engine in a truck with poor reliability.Been burned too many times by GM.Think the're listening? Nah. Have you seen the Pontiac Aztec? How about the Buick Rendezvous? Way to go GM. Try to compete w/Lexus& Acura in the newest fad, car-based SUV's. Except you go to battle with an ancient pushrod engine, a plasticy interior, and "unique" styling to say the least. Typical of GM, show up to a gunfight & pull out a knife!! Like the old saying goes: Nobody Sweats The Recalls Like GM.
