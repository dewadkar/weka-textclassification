            For several years now I have been taking pictures with my parents' Canon 35mm Camera, scanning them using a flatbed scanner, and posting them on my website. However, it takes ages to scan the lot, and the quality isn't good, not to mention the extortionate cost of film and developing. So, I knew I wanted digital. As we're not exactly rich and it was my 18th birthday, I was looking at something around the �200 mark. At first I was looking at a Kodak DC215 Zoom, but when I walked into the local camera shop, they had the Minolta Dimage 2300 on offer for �249. 

Compared to the Kodak it was a much better proposition, as it came with double the memory and a 2.3 megapixel resolution compared with a 1 megapixel for the Kodak. Due to a shop error (which I wasn't going to complain about!) I got two 8MB memory cards for free!

On the morning of my birthday, I unwrapped it (we are big on ceremony in our family! :-)) and put in four AA batteries of my sisters. Following the instructions, I switched it on, it flickered to life, and then died again. Obviously the cheap and nasty &quot;20 for �1&quot; batteries my sister had bought on the market were not good enough. Later that morning I bought some high-power ones, which worked fine and are still in use today, and today I bought a set of NIMH batteries and a charger. At the rate it eats batteries I'll need them!

Picture quality is good, even on Economy mode. I found you can fit more pictures onto a card if you half the size - for PC viewing the size of the pictures is not so important, so the 800x600 resolution at standard resolution lets me fit about 120 pictures on one 8MB compactflash card.

The camera itself is quite easy to use when you get the hang of it, although I can't fiddle around with the flash settings without the manual to hand. It's nice and light, and comes with a good quality case and strap, as well as all the cables you need to get started.

It doesn't have an optical zoom, which is a bit of a nuisance, but with such a high resolution you can zoom in quite well digitally, either using the camera itself or image editing software (I like PaintShop Pro)<br><br>
