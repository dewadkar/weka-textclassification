            We recently had the opportunity to take a Hyundai XG 350 on a 900-mile "test drive" up to Yellowstone National Park.    We were really just renting a car for four days, but since we ARE in the market for a new car, we were seriously considering Hyundais as a make we'd be interested in.  Several friends of ours have bought recent model Hyundais, and they've been impressed with their cars.  And so have we.  But when we found out we'd be driving a Hyundai, we were initially disappointed.  Our first thought when we saw the Hyundai logo on the key was "small, gutless, cramped, ghetto ride from the early 90's that's gonna break down somewhere in central Idaho."  As it turns out, all of the above first impressions were patently false.  

We were impressed with this vehicle.  Our then-current ride was a Mazda 626, and we were looking for something with a little more power, and a little more room to take some camping gear along with us and our baby boy on the trip from Salt Lake City to Yellowstone.  And if we could do that comfortably, even better!  The Hyundai XG 350 delivered on every count.  

The first thing that struck me was the interior...my wife said, "oh, MAN--it's VINYL!!!!"  No honey, that's LEATHER.  The car had 400 miles on it--we packed on another 900 in four days, which means we were in that car pretty much all the time.  And we were very comfortable.  I had back surgery a year ago to dig a vestigial tail out of my lower spine, and if I'm sitting in most chairs for more than an hour, I start to get very stiff.  Cars can be especially tortuous, and living in the middle of the West where we do, pretty much everything is at least seven hours away:  Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, are all a good day's journey away, and since we go to all of them on a semi-regular basis, I've learned to live with my misery.  On this trip, I was completely comfortable.  The seats' padding, positioning, and leg and head room were all perfect.  My wife and I are both six feet tall, and were both very comfortable.  There was ample room in the back seat for adults--we just had the boy in his car seat, but everything was very spacious for this class of car.  The seats are leather, the climate controls were intuitive and functioned excellently, and the factory stereo was more than adequate for our U2-marathon.

But there's more to this car than the unexpectedly classy interior.  What we were really after was a car with a V-6...traveling that far and over as many mountains as we were going to be, we wanted something with substantially more cajones than our 626.  And we got it.  The XG 350 has a V-6, and a powerful one at that.  We were able to pass every vehicle we needed to (a novelty for us), and had enough power to easily go over the mountain passes--even the formidable Targhee Pass from Jackson Hole down into Idaho.  This was like the ultimate test drive--not just tackling freeway speeds, but doing so at a 12 percent grade, and doing it without the temperature gauge going up, any undue engine noise, or any reduction in maneuverability.  

The trunk space was also impressive, and we were able to pile all of our camping supplies into the trunk, which, like Mary Poppins' carpetbag, is larger than it looks from the outside.  We crammed it full of everything we needed for two adults and The Cutest Boy Ever Made, and still had some room to spare.  

So, with all of these positives, would we buy it?  The answer is probably no.  The price range is right around $25,000, and after talking about it, we decided that, although we were impressed with most aspects of the car, with other companies we'd get more car for our money, and other companies have a more reliable track record.  Hyundai has made major strides with this car (and their other new models), but we're not ready to commit to a company that has only recently made the turn-around.  I have nothing but fond memories of this car and our 900-mile "test drive," but I think we'd pass on this one.
