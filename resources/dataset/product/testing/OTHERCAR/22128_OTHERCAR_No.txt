            A good friend has a Kodak 265 which is an incredible camera, so I've taken pictures with both the 265 and 215.  At the time, the 265 was close to $1000, but price drops have brought it to much less on the internet. 

I ended up buying a $300 Kodak 215 to save money.  It takes good pictures, unless there is any movement - e.g., photos at a football game are blurry, even the pregame standing around. But what I dislike the most about the 215 is the display.  On the 265, you see your picture in beautiful detail and you know that you've got it. That's the reason I wanted a digital camera!  With the 215, the display is average to poor.  Compare them at the store before you buy one.  Seems like Kodak saved money here.  The 215 is ok, don't get me wrong, but if I had it to do again, it's an easy choice.  

Save your money and get the 265 - you'll be <b>much</b> happier.  You have to buy a flash memory card, reader, rechargeable batteries, and a case anyway, so the relative price gets closer.  I'd love to trade up.  

By the way, both cameras work very well through the eyepiece of a microscope.<br><br>
