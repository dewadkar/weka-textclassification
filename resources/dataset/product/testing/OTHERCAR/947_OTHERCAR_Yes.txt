            My wife and I were in need of a cheap dependable car with more than standard equipment.  Not wanting to compromise quality for toys we bought our Kia LS, used, from some people that attended our church. We found the best of both worlds.  The car only had 28,000 miles on it, the physical appearance was exceptional, with the exception of the dash, and it had most of the goodies.  At the time we purchased our car we had taken it to our mechanic, got a clean bill of health and a suggested remedy for a warped dash.

We have owned the car for about a year now and have had no mechanical problems (as expected from our mechanic), however the dash continually got worse to the point of needing immediate repair.  The dash had warped so bad that it was impeding the defrost vents on top of the dash.  To put it simply the dash had curled up and was touching the windshield.  

After trying to contact various body shops and local parts stores for replacement dash covers, it was apparent that only a Kia dealership could help (same scenario as when we had to get keys made).  At a cost of $250.00 for the part itself and another $250.00 to have it fixed. I decided to see if I could glue it myself.  What a project and to no avail.  I sent it to a professional that charged a little less than Kia would have, but he still had to purchase the dash from Kia. 

To make a long story short, the glue that was used by Kia completely broke down and would no longer adhere the dash to the &quot;sub-dash&quot;.  Not only did it stop sticking but it ran onto all of the electrical components and broke down the plastic wiring and harnesses.

The Good - As long as nothing electrical goes wrong, the car will last a long time.   
The Bad - I would have a higher opinion about the car if I wasn't forced to pay dealer prices for parts and service.
The Ugly - If something does happen to go wrong, be ready to visit your local Kia dealership.<br><br>
