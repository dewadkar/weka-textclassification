            I bought my 95 del Sol SI brand new off the dealer's floor in 1995.

Main reasons I bought the car:  I needed a short vehicle but one with lots of leg and headroom (I'm 6'2").  delSol fit the bill exactly.  Essentially, Honda took a 4-seat Civic, got rid of the rear seats, and gave that space partly to a larger trunk and partly to incredible leg room.

Removable top was a bonus as far as I was concerned.

Trunk room is outstanding for a small car.  I regularly travel and have no problem fitting a couple bags plus my computer in the trunk, even if the roof is mounted in its handy rack.

The lockable storage bins behind the seats are very handy for holding all sorts of stuff.  Some people mount a CD changer in the one behind the driver.

Power is good to very good.  The Si model has a VTEC engine that can spin the drive wheels, though I don't ever do "burn outs" myself.  Cruising at 70 to 85 mph is effortless; above 90 the engine makes its presence known.

The manual transmission is outstanding.  The ratios are well chosen and the shift action is very smooth.  I usually use only one finger to shift gears.

I have had no problems in 78000 miles.  Change oil and filters.  Spark plugs at 65000 miles.  Tires as needed.

Brakes are still original.  The brake check guy insists they are in great shape and refuses to take my money!

As with many small cars, road noise is pronounced.  Tire choice, and especially road surface, greatly affect noise.  the body flexes noticeably when the roof is removed.  This is not a sports car, but rather a sporty small car.  The body flex makes handling a bit jittery, especially with the top removed.  On hot days, the roof sometimes creaks a little.  Some people have reported problems with water leakage around the front corners of the roof where it meets the window, but mine does not have this problem.

Handling overall is very good, if not quite up to sports car standards.  Some people add inexpensive aftermarket braces on the front and rear suspension towers to reduce flex and improve handling.  I never felt the need, though I can see the benefit.

The seats are very good.  Mine still look and feel like new.  A major consumer testing organization (you know the one) a few years ago tested cars for the protection their seats offered in rear end collisions.  Only the del Sol and one very expensive Mercedes rated at the top!

My del Sol is getting a little old, but it doesn't show its age.  Everything still works like new.  One common problem on all del Sols has shown up on mine:  The interior door panel skin partially separates from the underlying foundation in the armrest area.  This results in a rippled appearance.

I keep looking at new cars, but I don't see anything that offers the value and features that first attracted me to the del Sol.  So, why spend the money when I already have what I want?

Oh, and the mileage is great.  Keep air in the tires and expect 31-33 mpg.
