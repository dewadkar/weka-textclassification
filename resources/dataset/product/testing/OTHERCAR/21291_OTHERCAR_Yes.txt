            Toyota's Camry has been a reliable model for year, but since its original overhaul in 1992, it has been especially so.  Mine is a '92, and I have never had a problem with it, except for the power antenna.  This can be a problem for many cars, but many of my Camry-driving friends have also had the problem.  It's about 200 bucks to fix, so watch out.  Otherwise, it's an excellent buy.  It's a good size, four-cylinder sedan, with all the amenities.  A fine driving experience.  A V-6 is optional, but I have never felt that I lacked power under the hood, and I do a great deal of highway driving.  The trunk is spacious, and it comes with a real tire as a spare.  Power locks and windows have worked consistently.  The stereo sounds wonderful--a must for someone like me.  I couldn't recommend this car more.  As for the new models, I have driven them and they seem just as excellent, perhaps even better.
