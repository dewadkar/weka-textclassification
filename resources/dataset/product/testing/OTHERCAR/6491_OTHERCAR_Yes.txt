                 I have owned a Kodak DX3600 2.2 megapixel digital camera for about six months now and can't imagine living without it. It has survived a few accidental falls, trips of all kinds and continues to take great pictures of my newborn son. This is a great camera for someone looking for basic features and simplicity of use. I purchased mine online for $190 (without the dock which was purchased later).
     The DX3600 has all the standard stuff: LCD display, internal storage of up to 50 low resolution pictures, about 90 seconds of video, 2x optical and 6x digital zoom. It also includes both digital and optical zoom. Not all Kodaks include an optical zoom- make sure you get this feature. The internal camera software and controls are user friendly for the most part, but the title of the highlighted menu item is displayed in very small print at the top of the LCD screen and disappears after 2 seconds of display. This makes it confusing sometimes as to what option you're dealing with. The picture quality is a little better than what you would expect from a 2.2 Megapixel camera. The Hi Resolution mode will take pictures worthy of printing up to 5x7 while the low resolution mode is adequate for 4x6 and 3x5 prints. In video mode, the low resolution mode is quite poor and will yield about 90 seconds of continuous video. In Hi-Res mode, the camera will give about 30 seconds of adequate video- the kind of stuff I send to the grandparents to show first steps, smiles, etc. Bottom line: this is not a video camera. 
     Without the Kodak EasyShare docking station, the output for TV or computer interface is on the side of the camera under a folding rubber/plastic cover. This is one of the few definite weaknesses of the camera- the folding cover is a bit flimsy and did, over time, become worn and chipped. However, the TV cords were supplied with the camera as was a USB cable for computer downloading. Additionally, without the dock, the provided lithium battery drains quickly (1-2 weeks of regular use) and is expensive to replace.
     Now for the GOOD stuff. I am a big fan of the Kodak EasyShare docking station and the Kodak software for viewing and managing downloaded pictures on my computer. I opted for the EasyShare dock II after replacing the lithium batteries a few times. The dock cost me an extra $74 at WalMart (ouch!) but the rechargeable Ni-MH battery it includes is worth it. The battery recharges anytime the camera is docked and the EasyShare II dock has a battery level indicator on the front to show when the camera is ready for use. Downloading pictures is accomplished with a simple press of a button of the front of the dock and automatically starts the Kodak picture software on the computer. 
     Overall, for a 2.2 megapixel, new camera under $200, I have been very pleased and would recommend this for anyone interested in a recreational camera.
