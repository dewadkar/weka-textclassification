            This is a terrific digital camera.  I bought the camera about a month after it came out in London and was quite impressed with the fact that Nikon took steps to correct problems that were often found in the Coolpix 2500.  The Coolpix 3500 corrects the red-eye reduction problem found in the Coolpix 2500 digital camera and the camera also stores many more pictures than the 2500.  The Coolpix 3500 also has many more scenes in it to choose from.  This camera is great, light-weight and compact.  I also love how I don't have to look through the view lens to see my object and that the way it looks on the LCD is the way the picture comes out.  It makes is much more feasible to take pictures.  I brought it with me on my trip to Europe and it hasn't failed me yet!

Now, the cons of this camera is that it is quite a difficult camera to use for beginners.  I have to admit that I started with the Coolpix 2500 as my first digital camera and was completely overwhelmed by all the functions and options that the camera possessed.  I spent a few hours trying to figure out what buttons I should use and it greatly annoyed me.  But after getting through the basics, I was completely happy with this camera.  This camera also isn't worth the $300 or so that they're charging.  The Coolpix 2500 costs a bit more and the only completely noticable differences between the two cameras are that the Coolpix 3500 stores more pictures and that there is less of a red-eye reduction problem found in the Coolpix 3500. 

I would say not to buy the Coolpix 3500 unless you know you are going to be taking tons of pictures and the red-eye problem really does annoy you.  So unless you get a huge discount off of the Coolpix 3500, don't waste your money on it and go for the Coolpix 2500 instead.
