            I sold my 1996 B2300 today.  It was (still is most likely) red with an extended cab.  I loved that my 4 year old could ride in the back jump seat without a car seat and that my 2 year old's car seat fit in the other back jump seat.  I used the truck for a service business I owned and as I sold the business a year ago, I really had no reason for holding on to a pick-up (aside from the fact that they are the best vehicle out there (until you have kid number three and run out of seating capacity)).

I have mixed feelings about the truck.  The console in between the two front bucket seats broke the day after I bought it.  I bought it used,    so I don't know if this is how all the consoles are.  The mechanics at the CarMax I bought it at fixed the console (the problem was it was really loose and wobbled) and two days later it was broken again.  The mechanics told me to take it easy on it, but is this what you really want to hear about your truck???  Unfortunately, that console was a constant source of aggravation.  It was still wobblin' today when I sold it.

Another minor aggravation is the undercarriage (?) of the front driver seat.  I'm referring to the piece of plastic that hides the springs and gizmos under the seat.  After you step out of the truck a few times, you kick this piece off accidentally.  You can snap it back on, but it's in a place where you just keep kicking it off.  I finally kept it off and reattached it right before I sold it back to CarMax.

All in all, these are 2 minor grievances.  I had to replace the serpentine belt at 62,000 miles and I had a rear axle seal break.  It was also beginning to start &quot;rough&quot; when I sold it.  Apparently there was a problem with the &quot;pause&quot; apparatus.

I wouldn't tell someone not to buy one of these, but I probably would never buy another.
