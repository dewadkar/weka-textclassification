            I bought a 1998 CR-V for its overall size for I did not want a Ford Explorer size SUV.  In addition, I own a '87 Honda Prelude with over 220,000 miles and previously owned a 1978 Honda Accord Hatchback.  Due to my satisfaction with the Hatchback and Prelude, I decided on the CR-V.  I love my 87 Prelude so much I could not trade it in nor sell it, so I use it as my commute vehicle and use the CR-V for get aways (i.e., camping, hiking, fishing).

I like the size of the CR-V, from the driver's seat all the dashboard controls are easily accessible and readable.  My passengers like the fact that they can adjust the upper part of the back seats.

On long drives (probably over 2 hours) I have found the driver seat to be uncomfortable, making my legs fall alsleep.  The bottom cushion could be longer, for there is too much room between the end of the seat and my legs.  In addition, the slow truck lanes are meant for CR-Vs for the CR-V comes to a crawl climbing the hill.

The back cargo space is just right for me, although tight when others travel with me.  I even moved the front seats all the way up, folded down the back seats, through our gear in the front for my friend and I could sleep, at a tilt, in the back.  And I'm 6' 7&quot;.

I do not recommend buying the factory rack, because I have yet found a luggage cargo carrier (one to carry camping gear, fishing poles, etc.) for the rack.  I went to a Yakima dealer and in order to use any of the Yakima cargo carriers you have to by-pass the factory rack and buy the Yakima rack.  May be because the factory rack limit is 75 pounds and the Yakima cargo carrier weighs 35 lbs.  Allowing you to only carry 40 lbs of gear.<br><br>
