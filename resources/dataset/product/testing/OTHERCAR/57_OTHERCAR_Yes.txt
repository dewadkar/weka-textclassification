            i was in california for a car show (LA convention center)and i saw an E430 benz from Sprewell Racing and i thoungt this is one of the most beatiful car i ever seen.  Sprewell Racing is own by Latrell Sprewell who play basketball for the new york knicks.   About the car, Sprewell Racing put a set of 20 inch rims on the car and it look better than so many car at the show.  the car look more like a luxury and sport car that almost every american want to own one.  i highly recommend this car because i got one myself and i bought it for 59k.  it is very fast and a lot of american can afford it not like other benz for 100k.  <br><br>
