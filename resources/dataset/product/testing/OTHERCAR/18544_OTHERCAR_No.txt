            My very first car was an Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera.  I was estatic when I got the car.  I was 16 and worked a couple years to make enough to buy the car.  

It was a black, 1988 Cutlass Ciera.  It had a perfect body with no rust and the interior with every single power thing you could think of.  It had a 2.8L V-8 and an automatic transmission.  I spent $3800 to buy the car and about $1000 to fix it up (brakes, suspension, exhaust). 

My dad always told me that if you take care of your car, it will take care of you.  With that in mind, I always babied the car so it would last me.  I checked the oil once a week, along with other regular checks.  I did everything in my power to take car of the car.  

Well, that saying didn't hold up for me.  After about six months, I began having trouble.  The engine started running rough and would vibrate the whole car.  I could live with that, but I took it to the shop and they said everything was fine.  Well, I kept driving and it got worse.  Then, I had the scare of a lifetime.  I was driving down a highway and suddenly the engine died.  I lost my power brakes and steering.  I was able to get it off to the side of the road and it started up again.  Well, this kind of thing became common place.  It happened 17 more times before I got rid of the car.  I took the car in to the shop and had a few friends, who were mechanics, look at it.  Everyone had a different story.  Some said I had a bad head gasket, some said a bad cylinder, and some said bad spark plugs.

Well, I had had enough of that car.  After I had only had the car for 10 months, I traded it in for another car.  I only got $1200 trade for my Oldsmobile.  

Overall, it was a nice car on the outside, but on the inside was a piece of junk.  It was unsafe and a waste of money.  If you are looking to buy a car, stay away from Oldsmobile Cutlass Cieras.<br><br>
