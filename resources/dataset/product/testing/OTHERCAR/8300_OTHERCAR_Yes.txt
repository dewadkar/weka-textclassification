            My Toyota Corolla 2003 is just superb. I just can't help but appreciate its good build quality and the other refinements Toyota has put into it. Some examples - the super brightness of the Optitron speedometer (and choice of 3 colors), leather, the gate-shift type throttle (automatic), 16-inch wheels (instead of 15 in other cars), cavernous cargo hold, the good all around view, good front legroom and driver's head clearance (passenger space was alright), an excellent sound system (the great deep bass especially got my attention!), dashboard controls are easy to grab and turn, super strong a/c, collision/parking sensors, and did you know that the rear window also doubles as a radio antenna? Radical. This leads some people to call it a "Baby Lexus." Well, I can't argue with that. The ride is quite smooth, especially on the highway, although some wind noise is apparent. When you close the doors on a Corolla, the deep "thud" you hear sounds like you are closing the door on a Benz or BMW. You don't hear that with other cars (i.e., Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, etc.) which have thin aluminum can-type doors. Yep, these spell the difference in side-impact collisions.

If I have any qualms, they are minor: the front seats don't adjust as far back as I want (I'm 6'2"). Dead man's pedal beside gas pedal is awkward, but I can live with that. Cornering can be a dodgy. Suspension is somewhat soft (which explains why its great on highways, but so-so in the city). Power isn't so spectacular, but adequate and smooth. Civics and Lancers can do better in these two areas. But in other areas, the Toyota Corolla 2003 (also known as the "Corolla Altis" in other countries) is a class act to follow and hard to beat, too.

Yes, I'm quite satisfied with my Corolla and knowing that Toyota's famed reliability and the car's excellent safety record is backing it up makes me sleep better at night. I have only taken it in for regular checks since I bought it. All I usually do is just put in the gas and windshield wiper fluid and that's it -- no hassles, no worries. That's the kind of car it is. Another thing I considered before I bought the car was its great resale value. If in the future you wanted to sell your car, there will be takers who will pay good money for a Toyota.
