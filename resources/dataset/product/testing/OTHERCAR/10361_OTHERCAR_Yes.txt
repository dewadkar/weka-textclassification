            I've had my 2000 Tacoma PreRunner XtraCab TRD just over 2 weeks,
and I'm very pleased with it. Make sure you get the digital clock
thrown in with the deal, though. While washing the truck yesterday, I noticed that my front right mudguard has come loose. Upon closer inspection, the 3 screw holes in the mudguard had been torn. Anyways, they're to be replaced tomorrow. The V6 engine is silky smooth, and the
automatic transmission shifts wonderfully. I intend to keep this truck
at least 8-10 years, and have always been pleased with Toyota products. I bought this truck to eventually replace my 1972 Chevy C10 pickup, I do alot of hauling of yard debris, etc and really like the tall stance the Tacoma gives. I'm 6'2&quot;, 225# and I'm very comfortable in this truck, I get around 20mpg in the city.
