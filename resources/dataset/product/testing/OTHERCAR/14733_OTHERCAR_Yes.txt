            It did my heart wonders to own this <b>Honda CRXsi</b>. Just to think I wasn't even going to buy a car that day! Which is usually the way I end up being a  new car owner, <b>everytime</b>.

In 1986, my friend had ordered a white CRXsi, and needed a ride down to get her new car. So I volunteered to take her. It was taking a long time for her to get all the paperwork done, so I was browsing around the showroom. Here sat this snazzy little <b>Honda CRXsi</b>, begging me to get in!

Well, that's all it took! Talk about sports car feel! It was the closest I would get to having a REAL sports car (which by the way was what insurance considered it). I walked around it a dozen times, sat in both seats (it was a two-seater). When my friend was done with her car business, the salesguy came out and said, &quot;Hey, what do you think?&quot;

I said, &quot;I love it!&quot;  He said, &quot;You might as well get one too!&quot; I tried telling myself <b>NO</b>, but myself wasn't listening! He said this one is taken, but I can see what we can find around the area. I told him, I wanted one JUST like this one, or not at all!

He did, find one just like it, up north somewhere. A guy would drive it down in a few days....Did I <b>really</b> want it? Gulp!......<b>yes!</b>

Oh no, what did I do? Well, I was happy on one hand, but feeling utterly with no control of <b>wanting this car!</b> badly! I filled out some paperwork, and it was a done deal!

I changed one thing about the car. The one thing that was different was it didn't already have a radio in it (the one up north). So I got it without, and chose to go buy my own at a stereo shop. I chose a really good Kenwood.

Okay, what was so special about this little dynamite of a car? <b>First</b>, class...it was so sharp, the paint was metallic black! Glistened in the sun! The inside was all black too, really easy to sit in bucket seats, fit my body just right. The shape of it was aerodynamic for 1986, and a car everyone noticed on the road. I got looks everywhere I went. People would come up to me too if it was parked and I was near,and ask me all about it! <b>Second</b>, easy to handle.....I could zip into and out of spaces most cars would not even consider. Passing any car or truck on the highway was a breeze! I used the fifth gear alot, and it really was handy. <b>Third</b>, space to carry items was plenty. The hatchback interior was surprisingly spacious. Since there were only the front seats, the whole back was cargo space. I could get fairly large boxes, laundry baskets, and yes, even kids in there (if they weren't too tall). I know kids are NOT supposed to ride back there, but back then seat belt laws were not being enforced. I only had to make a child ride back there occasionally, and am sorry now I did, but it worked! I would <b>NEVER</b> do that again for sure!

I paid around $11,000 for this car new in 1986. I had it for seven wonderful years! When washed and waxed it was a classy, snazzy, zippy car. I even miss it! It was a fun ride to say the least. It even had a back glass windshield wiper, that was innovative then! Gas mileage was fabulous...about 33 in city, about 38 on highway. It was the more souped up engine than the regular CRX,so the gas mileage was a tiny bit less than the regular CRX had.

It had a sunroof (moonroof), this was a problem at times. It would stick in place and not return to the off position. After many years it began to leak in around the gasket seal, and no amount of fixing would solve the problem. I would recommend not having the sunroof if I had to buy one of these used. Another problem was I had to get muffler replaced three or four times, it would rust out, from condensation forming inside. Honda always replaced it though. It was just a problem they had I guess.

Why did I trade it in? Well, again, I went looking again at cars..and the rest is history. Why is it that every seven years I get car fever??? I did it again recently. But my <b>Honda CRXsi</b> will go down in MY history as being a very special car to me...it was my first and probably last sports car, my little midlife thrill I guess...lol
