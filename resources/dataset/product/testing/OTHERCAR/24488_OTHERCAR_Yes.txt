            This car has been great since the &quot;bugs&quot; finally left! When we purchased this vehicle, it was a program car that was 4 years old with considerable low mileage. There seemed to be a few problems at first, but with the 70,000 mile warranty, everything was taken care of in it's own sweet time.  The car drives great, especially on long trips.  We have taken many trips of 400 miles and one two week trip to Canada.  This car feels very safe.  Nice and heavy, anti-lock brakes, cruise control all work great.  I have a 45 mile commute and it has yet to leave me on the side of the road.  There are many reasons to buy a vehicle new, this would have been a wonderful &quot;new&quot; car.  From driving other cars when needing a rental, I have never felt as safe as when I am driving my car.  Even the large SUV's that have been out, my car still feels safe.  Now that my car is somewhat older, its showing a little wear and tear.  But all in all it has been a great car.<br><br>
