            I'm so sorry to have to write about this truck in the past tense.  Yes, that's right, the Toyota T-100 is no longer in production.  In case your in the market for a great used truck, take a look at this, because this truck is a champ!

The T-100 Extended Cab is a mid-sized truck with a nice 3.21 liter V6 engine.  I bought a 1995 used T-100 truck 85,000 miles on it. Yeah, I know, the mileage scared me a little too.  But, let me tell you that the the mileage did not effect the engine or performance of the truck one bit.  I can only think that a newer T100 would be even better!  The interior of the truck was well assembled and heavy duty. There were no junky plastic parts to break off and the cloth seats wore very well.  

ATTENTION BOAT OWNERS This T-100 had great pickup and was awesome for towing. The city and highway ride of this truck was very smooth due to the long wheel base and it handled just as well off road. 

I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone looking for a midsized reliable foreign truck.  I can attest that even if it has high mileage, it's worth the purchase.<br><br>
