            I just recently bought this camera after spending a few days surfing the web for reviews.  I like the traditional and sleek design of the Canon S100 but the option of avi offered from Fuji just bowl me over.  I had a Kodak DC265 at the moment and want a little more bells and whistles.
The image quality is more than adequate for me.  I used the camera mostly for sharing photos over the net.  Now and then I want a hard copy of the image ( at most at 5 x 7)and the result is no less pleasing.  
  
I do wish that the camera can do more.  Only if this camera can run scripts, image files(ones not taken with the camera itself) can be downloaded to the camera to take full advantage of the slide show capability, and the time span can be adjusted between slides. 
Maybe the camera does have these capabilities (my kodak does but it is too cumbersome to carry around) and hopefully someone can show me how to.
(I did not get much from the included manual).

After three days of trying to get support from the Fuji technical staff, I finally got to speak to a live person ( I told them of my experience and they advised me to try call them in the evening.  They are there until 8pm ET). My concerns were addressed as follow:

1.  can you download the photo to the camera?  no the software wont allow it (however if you buy a card reader/writer (sandisk) this problem is licked to the tune of $45)

2.  can you change the time delay between slides? see (1)

3.  can you change the length of video recording to more than 80 sec or 12 M (I have the 64M memory card)? see (1)

The technical staff was very helpful.  I wish I can say the same for the software developer for this camera.  If not for the hardware folks, this camera should belong in the $100's range.
