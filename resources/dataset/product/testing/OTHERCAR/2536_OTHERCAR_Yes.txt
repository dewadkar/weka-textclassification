            Actually, after owning a Dodge minivan (back in 85) I was kinda soured by these beasts because it was always breaking down.  Now we moved to a lake resort area and needed someway to haul visitors around for sightseeing.  So we decided to revisit the minivan scene.

What turned us to take a close look at the Montana was the styling.  It wasn't your typical boxy look.  Also, our local dealer is a gem and he only sold GM.  So we test drove and bought one.  So far, I have been very happy. 

We have the 7 seat configuration with captains chairs in the front and middle and the bench in the back.  This machine has come in very handy for hauling bowling teams, visitors to the lake, neighbors out to eat....you get the idea.  We have had it since Feb 99 and it has been very reliable so far (17,000 miles).  

Things I like:

1) The back two rows of seats are very easy to take out for hauling all kinds of stuff.  We even hauled a canoe (it did stick out the back a little, but we didn't have far to go).

2) It has handled very well in the snow.

3) Easy to get in and out of.  I especially like the power sliding door.

4) The electric tire pump has been very useful for pumping up stuff around the house.

5) Lots of little storage areas and cup holders

Things I don't like:

1) The doors are kinda flimsy.  When you slam the door shut, the metal on the side of the door flexes a lot - makes me think there is no reinforcement behind the metal.

2) Kind of noisy at high speeds.  Has a few squeaks and rattles.

3) Fit and finish could be a little better considering I paid $28K for it.

4) I got the higher end radio with better speakers, but I think the sound quality of the system is just average.  My Chevy Truck has much better sound for listening to music on the road.

Overall, it is a great car and I would buy it again.  It has come in very handy for hauling people around the lake.<br><br>
