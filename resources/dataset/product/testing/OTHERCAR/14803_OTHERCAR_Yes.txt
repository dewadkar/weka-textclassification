            My wife has always wanted the S80.  We had our S40 for about two years and we decided to see what we could get for it if we traded up to the S60...we never thought we would get into the S80.

The front seats are extremely comfortable.  The drivers seat has three different memory positions.  All I have to do is hold down one of the buttons on the side of the seat and it moves into the position that I set it at�..very convenient when your wife is shorter that you are.  The front seats area also heated�I know that will come in handy in the winter months!  
The separate climate control for driver and passenger is a nice option to have.  Using the radio controls was easy to learn.  
They have a dial that you turn to select if you want AM, FM, Cassette or CD.  Sound quality is excellent.  We�ve not had any sound distortion or local stations fading out like with the S40 radio.  
It has plenty of cup holders and the center console will hold all your CD�s and other junk.  They even have a roomy storage compartment next to the radio that you can store your mobile phone in.  
The back seat has a large amount of room.  I�m 6� tall and I am very comfortable riding in the back seat.  
A nice comfort feature is the air vents located between the front and rear doors.  
The trunk can hold a large stroller and months supply of groceries.  

The styling of the car makes it even more appealing.  The notched back end and the slopped front make the car very stylish.  

The engine is powerful and very responsive.  There was no delays or jerks when we when stepped hard on the accelerator.  There was a seamless transition between the engine and the transmission
Gas mileage is good for a car that has a 6-cylinder engine.  19 and 26
