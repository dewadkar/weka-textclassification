            I bought a Malibu about 8 mo ago, it has been in the shop 12 times for many different problems.  From water in the floorboard to having 3 set of rotors put on it.  I love Chevrolet products but would not recommend anyone to get a Malibu.  There are good points to the car it is a smooth ride (when everything works properly).  It was a good deal as far as money wise.  I am a young woman, this was my first car that i bought on my own with out anyone's help.  This was a good car for that reason, except for all of the trips to the shop.  I am currently trying to get this car Lemon Lawed.  So I dont really recommend anyone buying this car. <br><br>
