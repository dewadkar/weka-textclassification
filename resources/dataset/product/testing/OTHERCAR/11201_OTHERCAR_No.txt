                 I bought this vehicle because it looked good, and I thought I was getting a good deal for the price.  After I had it for a week I found out that it wasn't as good as I had thought.
     In less than a month I had it in the shop three times. They had to replace the ball joints, a trunk lock that had just been replaced at purchase, and now it needs other parts that are not covered by my extended warrantee.
     My cousin also bought this car and neither one of us can drive them in the winter.  They have low-profile, wide tires that just don't have enough traction in snow. 
     The only option I have with where i have to drive daily is to trade it in.  For a summer car it is okay, but if you live out in the country as we do, it is not a good choice.  
     I would recommend that when you are buying a car that you do it in the type of weather that you know will be the hardest to drive in, and then you know if you have a winter lemon or a good car.
     Now, don't think there is nothing good about this car.  I love driving it in the summer because you have room to be comfortable and the air conditioning works great.  It is a good car for long trips to the amusement parks with the kids because they are not all crammed in. 
     If i had a choice i would keep the cougar for the summer and buy a truck for the winter, but not everyone can afford that luxury.  But if you like the Cougar XR-7, and you can have something else to drive in the winter, it would be a good car for you.  On the other hand, if it is the only vehicle you can afford, look further because it is not the right one.
