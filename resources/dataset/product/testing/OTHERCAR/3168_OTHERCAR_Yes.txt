            A few months ago my older brother recently bought a used camaro.  After he bought it, I bought his older Mustang off of him.  Anyway, we are here to talk about the camaro.  It is sleek and stylish.  It has the power that most sports cars lack.  I've rode in it a few times when we came home for Christmas and other holiday's.  I must admit, the car rides great.  Although, there is one problem with it.  It doesn't ride good in the snow.  When you give it a little gas the back end just slides out.

Anyway, the car is a great everyday car.  It is comfortable and you can probably fall asleep if your the passenger.  It also has a great system in it.  I hate how most of the cars come with a bum stereo system.  That just kills me!!!  When I first seen it I said it has the looks, but the inside can't be as good as the outside.  I was wrong.  The car is probably half and half on the style with the inside and outside.  Not one is better than the other.  IF you find a flaw in one then there has to be one in the other also.  If you are thinking about purchasing this car I would recommend it.<br><br>
