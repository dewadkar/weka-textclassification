            I bought a new 1999 Mitsubishi Galant and had it for about 18 mos. when one night while driving home from work the transmission went out. I called Diamond care and they would arrange for the tow but because I had 36023 miles it was outside of the 36000 mile warranty and the tow would not be covered (60 miles from home-$149.00). No problem, my insurance co. will take care of it. I called the dealer to check if the transmission would be covered and was told no, it was not under warranty and would cost between 2000-2500 to replace. It was indeed under warranty after all and it was repaired, however, loaner cars are not given when it is a drivetrain problem, so I rented a car for a week while it was in the shop ($200). I picked up the car from the Mitsubishi dealer and drove directly to a Toyota dealer. I asked the salesman what the most reliable car they sold was and drove home in a 2001 Corolla. I am so happy with my decision. Although the Corolla is not nearly as stylish, it drives, and that is good enough for me.
