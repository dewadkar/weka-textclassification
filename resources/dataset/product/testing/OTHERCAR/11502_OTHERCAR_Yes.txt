            I have owned a 348 Ferrari, BMW M Roadster (European Version with 321 HP), and most recently a 2001 BMW M3.  After being less than satisfied with my BMW, I went back to the Porsche Dealer because I was curious what the same amount of money (I just ordered the car fully loaded for 2500 bucks less than I paid for the BMW), would get me.

He suggested I take the Boxster S out for a spin.  I was at first a little hesitant as I too thought the Boxster was half a 911.  I was completely wrong.

Let me say that there are three Boxsters:  the base model, with the 2.7 liter engine, the Boxster "S" and a Boxster "S" with the sport suspension, 18 inch wheels and the optional PSM.  If you drive the car with these options, you will experience handling that only Michael Schuhmacher experiences.  The grip is breathtaking and the fun factor is perfect.

If you look a little deeper, you see that the Build Quality is also exemplary.  Every detail, from the tachometer in the middle of your site, to the only 12 seconds it takes to put up or lower the roof.  Every detail, just right.

As for the acceleration....yes, could be faster, but it is at least as fast as the BMW M3, and much faster in the curves.  Add a little water to the picture and the BMW is sitting against a tree, while the Porsche zooms along.

The Porsche's BOSE sound system makes BMWs Harmon Kardon sound like a walkman.  

As for the braking.....step on that pedal, and feel what it is like to be a deceleration god.  Brake while in a turn....you will touch engineering grateness...the car behaves like it is on a train track.

Before you buy any other car....try the Boxster "S" with the beforementioned options....you won't be disappointed.
