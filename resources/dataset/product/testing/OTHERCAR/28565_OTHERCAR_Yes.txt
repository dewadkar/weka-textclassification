            Let's compare the Jeep to some other vehicles:
PT Cruiser versus Plymouth Prowler
VW Beetle versus VW Cabrio
In both cases, the convertible costs more than the equally trendy hard top, but not the case when you compare the Jeep Wrangler convertible to pricier sport utilities, all the way up to the overpriced Hummer, which shares the Wrangler's bold, utilitarian style at 10 times the price... who would waste that much money when they could have a car as great as the Jeep Wrangler for so much less? When the Mazda Miata was introduced, it was designed to compete with convertibles like the Geo Metro and Honda del Sol, and as it grew more popular, the price was raised more and more until today, when it competes with high priced convertibles like the BMW Z3. Why spend more than 20,000 for a convertible when you could have a convertible SUV as unique as the Wrangler? I hope I've made my point that the Wrangler really gives you a lot of style without costing you a lot of money, so if you're thinking about the Wrangler, go for it!<br><br>
