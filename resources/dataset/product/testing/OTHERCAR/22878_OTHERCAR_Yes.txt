            Well I got this car in the Fall of 2001 when I was entering my Freshmen year at the University of Rhode Island. I intended on commuting all four years, the ride isn't too bad, maybe 20 minutes. I needed a car that wouldn't break down every month and one that was somewhat good on gas. I found the perfect car for my situation: a gray 2-door Dodge Shadow. I am now in my Junior year and I still am commuting with this car! The best thing about this car is that you can drive it for months on end without even doing any maintenance on it. It's sad because you eventually just get use to this low maintenance and kind of start taking it for granted. Like I just went through a whole semester without touching it.......not even the oil! That's because this car is so durable; it can handle the grind of commuting day after day and yet it still holds up. It's a tiny little car so it's a cinch to drive! I recommend this car to any high schooler who is JUST starting out learning how to drive. Parents will feel extremely safe knowing their son or daughter is driving this car around because it is so easy to get around in. This isn't your typical high school junk car that explodes every week and is a hog to drive. No no, the Dodge Shadow is different because it is such a simple little car nothing is too complicated. It is also very easy to turn in tough spots because it is so small this car can fit anywhere. If you need to park in that tiny little spot, chances are you can make this car fit! The gas mileage I thought was kind of a problem, but after a few years I realized it's actually pretty good! I get around 32mpg. I will continue using this car until college ends in 2 more years then I will get a better one, but for now this car is just great for my situation. I recommend this to anybody who makes long commutes or drives a long way to work everyday.....this car WILL handle the toughest commutes! Great car!
