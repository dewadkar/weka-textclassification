            I bought my very first car (2000 Civic VP) December 1999 during my senior year of college. I had never had a car before so this was a big event for me. My roommate had (and still has) a 1986 Accord and it was awesome, never had problems. So, for me it was a really easy decision, plus I loved the look of the new Civic. I have put so many miles on it (almost at 15,000) and I love it.  The only thing I would have to say is that the pick up isn't like that of a V6 but that's to be expected. It's still a zippy car that is super reliable. It's a great first car (a great low price) and I plan on having it for a long time.. I definitely recommend this car to everyone.<br><br>
