            I bought the Casio Exilim EX-S2 Digital Camera from Ritz Camera. As usual, they delivered the product right on time with no problems (I also bought a Nikon F100 from them).

I saw this camera in WalMart recently, but they were sold out. And that's not surprising because this is ONE COOL CAMERA! It's got 2.0 Mega Pixels, so the picture quality is pretty good. I have taken about 100 pictures with it so far, both indoors and outside. Overall picture quality is better than I expected for such a diminutive machine. 

This thing is so small it's no problem to carry it around and have with you all the time. The menu options are very intutive, in fact, you probably won't even need to crack the instruction guide. It comes with several pre-set photo "modes," which are optimized for shooting under different conditions: indoors, portraits, night shots, b w, sepia ("old-fashioned"), etc.

The setup was easy, too. Install the USB driver and PhotoLoad software from the CD (included), then you're up and running. Total setup time was less than 10 mins. The camera includes a really cool "cradle" that sits on the desk next to your compter. Looks kind of like a little business card tray with cool see-thru green plastic supports. Camera "sits" right in the holder, which doubles as USB port and recharger. 

The camera also takes nice little movie clips, up to 30 secs. This may not sound like much, but you can create neat little movies in .AVI format; these are easily posted to the Web and also can be sent through e-mail. 

Overall, I'm very happy with this camera. In fact, I'm selling my [APS] Contax Tix because this is a much better choice for casual "point and shoot" photo opportunities...
