            We bought our Kia Sephia almost 2 years ago and its a 1997 model.  We initially were looking at much pricier cars and realized that it just wasn't in our budget.  We did alot of research through of course...the internet and saw that the Sephia was very comparable with the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Tercel, the Nova and some other well know cars.  Then we did our pricing and we ended up taking leftover with only about 900 miles on it and fully loaded for only about $9,900.  Its got everything we could have ever wanted.  Power everything, CD player, cruise control, alloy wheels, rear spoiler, some pin striping, and of course air conditioning.  

I'm so far very happy with the car.  It has about 38,000 miles on it and it needs tires now.  We did have to replace the battery recently, but other than that we have just put maintenance money into it.  I think it's a very good car for the money.

It handles and rides well.  It looks nice. It's comfortable and roomy.  The trunk space is huge compared to some other cars we checked out.  My two children ride comfortably in the back, in the car seats.  The CD player, radio and speakers sound great.  It gets very good mileage, except that I think the tank is rather small because it doesn't seem to go very far on  a full tank.

My only real complaint about my Sephia is I think the inside noise while driving is really loud compared to my other car, which is a Honda Accord.  I feel like I can hear all the pebbles I run over.  I also have to play the radio pretty loud to hear over the noise.  But, I would still recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable, safe, nice looking car, for a great price!<br><br>
