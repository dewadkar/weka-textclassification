            I bought the A70 after reading numerous positive reviews on various web sites.  I can add that my experience with the camera after 5 months of ownership has been excellent.  Of course it takes fantastic pictures.  The things that I think set it apart from some other digitals is:
1. Long battery life--I have been using costco kirkland alkaline batteries (it takes 4) and they last about a month.  I take about 50 photos and 4 to 5 minutes of 640 x480 video on the camera a month.  I'm sure if I got some decent batteries the life span would be much longer.
2. excellent flash--good coverage
3.  Very usable video mode-I love making videos with this camera--very easy  multiple shooting modes.  Great for archiving on your computer and having fun with..  You can play them back at full screen on your tv with included rca cable.
4. options galore...you can get different lenses for this thing, underwater camera case, records audio with pictures if you want, professional level exposure, aperture control.
5.  It's a steal...I paid 299 from a web seller and that included a 128 mb memory card.  Enough memory for 70 2.0 megapixel photos, 4 minutes of 320x240 video with sound,  and about 20 full 3.3 megapixel  resolution photos.
6.  I dropped it about 8 feet onto solid rock in Joshua Tree National park--it did a glancing blow on an angled section but it only suffered some minor scratches--works fine--so I got lucky but it must be stronger than it initially looks.
