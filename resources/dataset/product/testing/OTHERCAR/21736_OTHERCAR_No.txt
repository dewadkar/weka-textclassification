            It makes me grind my teeth when I think about all the trouble I had with this car! The absolute worst was when it would rain. The first time I realized this was when I was running late for work and when I got into the car I sat in a full-inch-deep puddle of water in my seat! When I took it in to get it fixed apparently there had been a recall on this model's weather-stripping, but it wasn't changed out before I bought it. &quot;OOPS, SORRY!&quot; The passenger side window wouldn't roll up one day, so I took it in to have it fixed and they had to give me a rental car for two days! Then three weeks later it wouldn't roll down. Yeah, thanks! I had also bought the sound system package, which included a c.d. player. When they supposedly had the car ready for me to pick up for the first time from the dealership, I got to work and was showing it to my friends when I realized there was no c.d player. The trunk rattled for the first three months of ownership because the realized that the 97 model's nuts and bolts that they used to keep the trunk closed on the 98 model was too big! I take it as a sign of GOD that after a  year of owning this one-way-ticket to GMAC's rental car lot,  this car was stolen and was never found by the police! 
I hear the 2000's are nice though:?}
Yes, this is a serious review. NO B.S.! 
Yes, it actually says in the car manual not to drive this car in the rain, b/c the roof WILL leak!

In light of a comment made about my review, which I appreciate greatly, I have decided to add a couple of qualities and features of the Cavalier.
The bucket seats in the back and front are actually really comfortable. I am an athletic guy, so I have a pretty big frame. The driver's side seat was actually very comfortable. I never actually sat in the passenger or back seats, but all passengers in front and back have agreed how roomy it was on the inside even though from the outside it looked very sleek and sporty. The only negative about the driver's side seat that I can think of was the mid console stuck out a little too much and after a long drive of your knee against this it can get really uncomfortable, but this DOES NOT affect day-to day driving. I was also very impressed with the stereo system that I upgraded to, after they put the right one in. The ride was also very quiet, except for the rattling trunk. F.Y.I.: The trunk can easily be fixed by buying some the correct size bolts form any auto parts store. The dealership told me that Chevy did not make the correct size bolts at the time, but were in the process of fixing this and they would send the new ones to me in the mail if requested. I just bought the correct size bolts from Ford. Can't remember part # though, sorry. 

I hope this is more helpful!<br><br>
