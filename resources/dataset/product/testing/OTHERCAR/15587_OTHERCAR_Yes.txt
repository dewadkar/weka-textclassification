            AUGUST 6TH, 2002 UPDATE: 
GREAT NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My complaint about my 1991 STS riding too low...well, all I did was rotate the height sensor arm (buy the 1991 Eldorado/Seville service manual off eBay) all the way up until the Electronic Level Control System inflated my air adjustable 'REGULAR' Sears-installed Monroe Sensatrac struts to my desired height. That's right, I said 'regular struts!!!!' For those who may not know: Cadillac no longer makes CCR struts, but I bet you that you won't know unless you go to a Cadillac dealership who has no CCR struts in stock. If they are in stock, they will insist that you put them on your 1991 STS or Seville. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!! Take your vehicle to Pep Boys, Sears, or whomever and have them put regular front and rear struts on your car. If you have a 1991 Eldorado (base, Biarritz, or ETC) or a Seville (or STS), you can use the same regular struts that are used on a 1990 model Eldorado or Seville. I had them installed yesterday on my 1991 STS and I feel great. I only paid $79.99 for each strut. Compared that to a CCR strut that cost about $300.00 for each rear and $200.00 for each front. I really wanted to try Gabriel Pro-Ryder with VST, but since I had the Sears card, I couldn't go wrong. As for the ride...well, I feel very comfortable going over speed bumps, dips, etc., without scraping my front valance panel, tail pipes, muffler, etc. The ride is a lil' bit harsh when traveling over rough roads (which I blame on my worn lower control arm bushings, brake reaction rod insulators, and front stabilizer link insulators)...otherwise, I have no complaints. BUY THE 1991 STS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!


ORIGINAL APRIL 4TH, 2002 REVIEW WITH <b>AUGUST 26th, 2002</b> ADDITIONAL INFO. AND CORRECTIONS:
The 1991 Seville STS has everything that there is to offer to compete against most late model luxury sedans. Best thing about it is that it's midsize. About the length equivalency of a 1996-2001 Cadillac Catera, but with a lower height. Bottom-line, the 1991 Seville STS is the smallest fully loaded Seville ever, but has the interior room equivalency of a 1998-2002 Seville STS (yes, I have compared them). Who needs a long (lengthy exterior) $55k Cadillac (with $600.00 monthly car notes) that depreciates 10k when you drive it off the lot (and another 20k when you put 30k miles on it) when you can have a midsize Cadillac with at least 92% of the features of a late model Cadillac STS for up to $8k. Price depends on mileage. All the following features are standard on the 1991 Seville STS (EXCEPT POWER MOON ROOF & FACTORY HANDSFREE CELLULAR MOBILE PHONE IN FRONT FLOOR CONSOLE): FACTORY CHROME TRIM, 140-amp alternator, V8, 4.9L Engine, 200 horses@4100 rpm, 275 lbs. of torque@3000 rpm, premium unleaded fuel (91 octane) with a capacity of 18.8 gallons, smooth 4-speed auto tranny with electronic shift control & overdrive (electronic tranny only available in 1991-2003 Cadillacs), factory handsfree cellular mobile phone, front-wheel drive, composite tusngsten-halogen headlamps (1998 STS model also uses 'tusngsten-halogen), gold-plated PASS keys with pellets in them for extra security, full <i>interior-matching</i> trunk carpet (this feature was only available on 1989-1991 STSs), <i>interior-matching</i> trunk mat with Cadillac logo in middle (only available on 1989-1991 STSs), <i>interior-matching</i> trunk lid lining (only available on 1989-1991 STSs), power release trunk, power trunk pull down (1998-2002 doesn't offer this feature), power fuel filler door release, lap/shoulder seat belts, auto load leveling system, heated outside power rearview mirrors, power door locks w/ central unlocking, automatic door locks, illuminated entry, factory keyless entry with Cadiilac-logo key fobs (not generic GM remotes like all other late model Cadillacs), power windows w/ express down driver's window & front side windows + rear window defogger, power 10 way adjustable front bucket leather seats with power lumbar, manually adjustable headrests, & seatback pockets, front and rear center armrests, rear leather seats with headrests, glossy ample burl woodgrain door panels (yes, there is a lot of glossy wood...nothing like the scattered wood you see in late model Cadillacs), power rack & pinion steering with a ratio of 15.6:1, power antenna, 4 wheel disc power abs brakes with auto & manual parking brake release, foot pedal parking brake, cruise control, center high-mounted stop lamp, premium clearcoat paint finish (glossy), waffle-like grille (similar to 1991 Eldorado), cadillac logos mounted on grille (not on hood like 1986-1991 base Seville),16" x 7" diamond finished alloy wheels with STS center caps (not wheel covers), driver information center (tells outside temp, trip odometer, date, time, fuel used, avg mpg, instantaneous mpg, coolant temp, instantaneous engine rpm, instantaneous battery voltage, etc.), onboard computer diagnostics (all you need is factory Cadillac service manual to interpret codes and service car yourself), digital clock display, floor shift (not on steering column), full floor console (with storage compartment, coin holder, and cup holder), illuminated entry, twilight sentinel (automatically turns headlamps on when the system senses that it's dark enough to do so), power windows, power front leather bucket seats with seatback pockets and <i>LATERAL SUPPORT</i> (not available on 1986-1991 base Sevilles and 1989-1990 STSs), power remote side view mirrors, interior 'exterior' lamp monitors, front seat dual visor sunshades with vanity mirrors and adjustable lights, courtesy & overhead lights, reading lights, trumpet horn, adjustable interior-matching leather-trimmed steering wheel, glove compartment latch and light with lock, front and dual rear cigarette lighters, climate control system, a/c, factory theft deterrent system, underhood lamp, trunk lamp, tire jack storage with compact spare tire & wheel, tire removal equipment, <i>dual trio-outlet</i> exhaust tailpipes (one muffler) (only available on 1990-1991 STSs), front/rear independent suspension, front/rear stabilizer bars, higher rate coil springs (only available on 1991 STS), audible reminders: headlights on, key left in ignition, seatbelts, turn signal, high engine temp., retained accessory power, great stereo, etc. Sounds like a great car, huh??? It is! However, the 1991 Cadillac Seville STS doesn't have traction control, heated leather seats, rear a/c vents, fog lamps, On-Star, navigation, CD changer in the front floor console storage compartment, 17" chrome wheels, side-impact and passenger air bags, 300 horses, 32 Valve Northstar Engine, Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist, Tire Pressure Monitoring, Analog instrument panel, programmable auto door locks, HID headlamps, or daytime running lamps, but most of the aforementioned features can be added for under $5k and the rest one can live without. 1991 Cadillac Seville STS comes in 6 colors: Royal Maroon, Sable Black, White Diamond (3-stage paint), Polo Green, Carmine Red, and Black Sapphire. They can be viewed on my webpage: http://www.geocities.com/sevillests1991/1991sts.html

1991 STS is also available with The Gold Emblem Package, vogue wheels and tires, vogue grille, vogue roof...just like late model Cadillacs. Sadly, the only interior color is beechwood. Not that it's a bad color because it's not, but it's the only interior color available for the 1991 Cadillac Seville STS. NOTE: This car is nothing like the base 1991 Seville!

On the downside, the rear power windows are only limited to being raised half way down. The same cheap-looking DIGITAL INSTRUMENT PANEL that was first introduced in 1986 was used in the 1991 STS! (It was later updated in 1992 and first used on the 1992 Eldo and Seville models!) If you live in a cold weather prone state, you'd better buy seat covers because the 1991 STS does not have heated leather seats! The leather seats in the STS does not have the traditional Cadillac wreath stitched in the front and rear seats (1989 and 1990 STS models have this feature). The factory keyless entry remote should have had a fuel door release button on it. The buttons on the keyless remote are: lock doors, unlock doors, activate interior lights, and trunk release. The optional 'PHAETON ROOF' of the Seville/Seville STS should not have covered up the rear vent glasses! Car didn't hold its value. Mine retailed brand new (in 1991) for $37k, but is currently worth about $5k and retails used for $4k-$8k. Compared that to those of a 1991 Lexus (which will go for about 10k), 1991 BMW, etc. In the event of an accident, your insurance company would probably pay you $3k-$3.5k to replace the car, but for some reason they charge you a higher premium than that of a newer sedan. 

Word of advice: Cadillac dealerships NOTORIOUSLY charge you an arm and a leg for repairs. Do yourself a favor and buy the 1991 Cadillac Eldorado/Seville service manual off of eBay...service your 1991 STS yourself.
