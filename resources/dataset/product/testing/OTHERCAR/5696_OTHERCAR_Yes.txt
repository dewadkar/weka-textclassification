            I actually bought this car as a favor for a friend who was going overseas. Although the Nissan Altima was off my radar at the time, I've been pleasantly surprised.

For the price category, the car handles well. It has a great style, and has not required any unexpected service in its first 50,000 miles.

For a mid size car, the Altima has ample room (I am 6' and feel the car is quite roomy). With the flip down back seat, i can put my skies in the trunk--which is great. I like the style, at work, everyone wants to ride in my car when we go to lunch.

The car get good gas mileage, I've averaged 31MPG in rush hour traffic. The car has great acceleration (I have the manual transmission). I have no problem keeping ahead of traffic.

I've been extremely impressed with the service I received from the different Nissan service team. This has been my best car ownership experience.
