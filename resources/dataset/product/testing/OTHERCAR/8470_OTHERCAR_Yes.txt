I had my digital camera �baptism of fire� during the summer of 1994 with one of the first Nikon/Kodak models, a very expensive and difficult to use monster based on the Nikon F4, with performance on par with models available today for less than one hundred dollars.  Since that time I have used, tested, and handled more than fifty different digital cameras ranging in price from the five grand Nikon D1X to the fifty dollar Polaroid JamCam. People often ask my advice about which digital camera will best meet their needs at the lowest price. Savvy consumers demand maximum value for their digital imaging dollars. 
 	
Intense competition between the major manufacturers for recession tight dollars has brought about the introduction of a whole new generation of digital cameras.  These new cameras are feature rich, simple to use, and very affordable. Features and performance that commanded prices in the one thousand dollar range just three years ago are available today for less than one third of that amount.  The most exciting battle in the ongoing digital camera wars is being fought on the two-megapixel point�n�shoot front.   Among the best of the new 2 megapixel digital picture taker�s are the Canon PowerShot A20, The Fuji Finepix 2600 Zoom, the Olympus Brio 150D Zoom, Sony�s DSC-P50, and the Toshiba PDR-M61.

If you are in the market for your first digital camera, there has never been a better time to buy, and the newest consumer level models will allow you to maximize your investment.  The best overall choice for first time buyers may be the Fuji FinePix 2600 Zoom, a value-packed entry-level 2 megapixel model with some surprising extras.  Unlike many of its competitors the 2600 features a 3X optical zoom lens, video mode, webcam capabilities, a 16Mb SmartMedia card (most entry level models provide only an 8Mb card) and rechargeable nickel-metal-hydride batteries and charger.  Fuji further sweetens an already great deal with image quality that�s on a par with higher-priced models and very simple operation. 

The Fuji 2600 Zoom provides very few traditional controls, instead users access the basic feature set through the LCD menu.  For point�n�shooters (Auto mode) using the menu is required only when changing flash settings, switching to macro focus, or selecting the picture quality settings. The 2600�s Manual mode provides exposure-compensation and white-balance controls, two very useful options for more advanced photographers, especially in tricky lighting situations. 

Menu navigation is relatively easy, although seasoned photographers generally prefer using buttons/dials to
control camera functions. The 2600 Zoom performs very well with quicker-than-average start-up/cycle times and comparatively short shutter lag.  The included AA nickel-metal-hydride rechargeable batteries are good for between 85 and 100 shots with moderate and 60-80 shots with constant LCD use. The 2600�s most glaring weakness is the LCD, which pumps up contrast and the color saturation, making it difficult to predict what the final image will actually look like.
 
Fortunately, the 2600�s image quality is quite impressive for a model in this price range. Skin tones are pleasing and colors are nicely (but not overly) saturated.  Overall the images tend to be just a bit on the warm side.  The built-in flash does yeoman work, but is a bit under-powered.  The 3X optical zoom does exhibit some barrel distortion (a noticeable curve in straight lines) at the widest setting.  This is a relatively common fault with digital camera lenses.   A much more important consideration is image detail and resolution which are very good.  First-rate white balance and a relatively low noise level further enhances image quality. 

The Fuji FinePix 2600 Zoom is a fine digital camera bargain at (street price) about 250 bucks.  Factor in an impressive feature set, not having to add re-chargeable batteries and charger to the final cost, and the included 16Mb SmartMedia card (good for approximately 20-24 high res images) and the Finepix 2600 begins to look very very good when measured against its more expensive competition. The menu-surfing required to make manual adjustments may frustrate some experienced photographers, but point�n�shooter�s who want a simple �auto everything� digital camera couldn't ask for an easier (right out of the box) camera to use.

<b>Appearance, Basic Operation, and Ergonomics</b>

The 2600 is an attractive silver colored compact all-plastic digital camera. Build quality is about average for units in this price range. This little Fuji is lightweight and will fit easily into most pockets or small purses. The camera is comfortable to hold and well designed for extended use. Operation is simple and all controls are logically placed.  The optical viewfinder is large, fairly bright, and easy to use.  There is no diopter adjustment. The simple viewfinder information display LED indicates autofocus and image processing status.  The 1.8� LCD is adequate and the 3X zoom does a commendable job (maximum aperture is f3.5 and focus range is 2.6 feet to infinity and as close as 3.9 inches in Macro mode) but isn�t threaded for supplement wide/telephoto adapters or filters.  

The built in flash (Fuji claims the maximum range is 3 meters---a bit more than 12 feet---between 9-10 feet is more accurate) like all point�n�shoot digital camera flashes is a little on the weak side. There is no AF illuminator. The 2600's playback mode provides thumbnail mode, DPOF print marking, and zoom and scroll. There is no image protection feature (so you can�t accidentally delete images you want to keep) and you can�t rotate images in-camera, both of which are puzzling omissions.

<b>A Few Concerns</b>

The FinePix 2600 doesn�t fare too well in low light situations because the lens is a bit slow, you can't set the shutter speeds manually, and the built-in flash is underpowered.  

<b>In the Field/Handling and Operation</b>

My friend and I managed to take the Fuji Finepix 2600 Zoom on a couple of photographic evaluation outings.  The weather here in Kentucky has been very changeable lately so we have had some gray rainy days and some bright windy days.  In gray overcast lighting the images from the 2600 look a little muddy, but in good outdoor lighting the images are surprisingly good.  We spent one afternoon looking around the Highlands neighborhood for signs of spring.  We found a beautiful dwarf iris in a small Baxter Avenue yard.  The flower was a stunning royal purple with bright yellow accents.  The 2600�s macro setting allowed us to capture some very good images of this tiny flower.  The detail was very good and the color balance was excellent.  Saturation was neutral with just a hint of warmth. 

On another outing we visited Louisville�s only arboretum, Cave Hill Cemetery, on an absolutely gorgeous day.  Cave Hill started out as a small heavily forested farm on the outskirts of the city.  The farm became Louisville�s primary burial ground in the mid 1840�s.  Since that time the area has been planted with thousands of trees, shrubs, and bushes.  Many of these plantings are rare flowering tree and shrubs that make Cave Hill absolutely gorgeous in the spring.  We were a little early for the dogwoods and redbuds, and most of the Japanese Magnolia blooms (that would normally be blooming all over the city) were killed by a late frost.  There were plenty of crocuses and daffodils to photograph and the Fuji did a great job on all of them.  

<b>Conclusion</b>

If you are in the market for your first digital camera or you need a point�n�shoot camera in the two megapixel range, the Fuji Finepix 2600 Zoom is worthy of serious consideration. I believe, that overall, the 2600 offers the best "bang for your buck" and it is an excellent first digital camera. The Fuji Finepix 2600 zoom offers an exceptional balance of features at an excellent price. Everything you need is included in the price, you won�t have buy rechargeable batteries (and charger) and the 16Mb SmartMedia card is big enough to get yiou started, and twice as large as the media cards provided by most of Fuji�s competitors

The FinePix 2600 Zoom is a very good "entry level" digital camera, especially for those who are looking for a simple and easy to use unit that delivers good image quality. It's compact enough to slip in a pocket or small purse and can be easily carried around all day without fatigue or discomfort. Under most lighting conditions the camera will deliver excellent image quality with well-saturated and properly exposed colors. The flash is adequate for normal situations and won�t over-expose close-up shots when using the macro mode. The 1600 x 1200 resolution will allow you to print good pictures up to 5X7 inch size. Excellent for email or web pages. If you're looking for a good first digital camera your options aren�t likely to get much better than this one.
