            i disagree with the other epinion almost completely.i own an&quot;01&quot;cavalier. i traded in my&quot;99&quot;cavalier for it.i chose to trade in while it still had high trade in value.because of the true bumper to bumper warranty for thirty six months it does not depreciate drastically until the warranty is done.unlike a mercury i had previously owned,which had a fifty dollar
service charge to use the warranty,this one is drive in and drive out.
  in both instances i chose the LS four door sedan.my wife and i hit the road for three to six weeks at least twice a year.we need the tilt wheel because we frequently change drivers.we need cruise control because of the
time behind the wheel.we need a good heater for our trip south in winter and a good air conditioner for cross country in summer.we find everything we want in a car is standard in the cavalier.dual airbags,antilock brakes,skid control etc.the only option we needed in the new one was a cassette player.the car came with a cd as standard equiptment.we listen to tapes as we travel.
  granted,the driver pushes his seat back because of the steering wheel and pedals but the passenger seat can be adjusted so both the front seat and back seat passenger can be reasonably comfortable.if there are usually four adults traveling together than no compact car will do.
  when comparing it to other compacts,i find it roomier and quieter than most.also the shoulder strap on both cavaliers that i owned were adjustable for height.maybe this is only in the sedan.
  the ninety nine gave us thirty one mpg for over the road and twenty six around town.so far the new one is slightly less.
  so, is the cavalier the best car on the road?i'm afraid not.the AAA gives that to the mercedes.is it the prettiest?probably not.but it is the best value for money spent.<br><br>
