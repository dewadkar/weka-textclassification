            I love my 1998 VW Jetta GLX.  This car is the first new car I ever bought.  I purchased it 3 months after graduating from college.  This car is ideal for recent college graduates because Volkswagen offers a great deal to recent graduates and also is more lenient on credit (they have their own credit corp.).  I wouldn't recommend it as a family car.  I purchased the model that has every amenity from leather, heated seats and power windows and door locks to an 8 speaker stereo system with a 6 disc changer.  The 178 horsepower engine offers incredible pick up and unbeatable speed (for the price of the automobile).  Also, I was in an extremely bad accident 7 months after buying my Jetta.  There was a total of four people in my car and we hit a concrete divider doing 80 miles an hour.  All four passengers had a seatbelt on, but there was $8000 worth of damage to the car and no one was hurt.  Everyone walked away from the accident.  I can honestly say that I do not have a bad thing to say about this automobile.  If I had the choice to make over again, I would buy the Jetta GLX in a heartbeat.<br><br>
