            Ever since I bought my first new car, I have wanted a Subaru. I frequently travel to Northern Michigan and needed a vehicle that would handle well on the ice and snow and also be a treat to drive. After much consideration, I decided to buy a Subaru Forester. When I first bought it I was very happy with it. It had its ideosyncracies like every car (the poorly placed cup holders, the shakes and rattles on the highway and the time it takes to start up in the cold weather) but all in all I was in love with the car. It handled beautifully in the snow, ice, rain - it didn't matter what the weather was like, I always felt safe in it. Then after about 59,000 miles I started to notice that the transmission was slipping more than usual after long trips. It always slipped a little when changing gears but never this bad. It wasn't until about 61,000 miles that it needed to be checked out. I took it to the Subaru dealership where I bought it and they said nothing was wrong with it. They said it was normal. I took it home and finally after about 62,000 miles the slipping became unbearable and I took it to the dealership again. This time they said something was wrong with it and it would need a new transmission. Of course I thought that since it had a powertrain warrantee until 60,000 miles it would be no problem. Wrong! They told me that if I had its 30,000 mile checkups done there that they could probably help me out but since I had them done somewhere else they wouldn't help me. I told them that I had the receipts for the 30,000 mile check-ups but they said that since I didn't have them done at a Subaru authorized dealership the warrantee is void and there is nothing they could do. I was livid. I only took the car somewhere else because I didn't want to pay the $300-400 charge for routine maintenance when I could get the same thing done somewhere else for $150. I asked to speak with the service manager's manager and he told me the same thing. Then I called Subaru and they told me the same thing. They said it is written in the warrantee part of the owner's manual and sure enough it was there. In the end I ended up trading the car in on a different car. Before all the trouble started I raved to people about how great the car was and that I would be buying Subaru's for the rest of my life. Now I'm driving something else and just raving mad at Subaru.
