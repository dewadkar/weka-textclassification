            I have leased a '98 Blazer for one year.  I was a prior owner of a '94 Ford Explorer.  
It is a sleek vehicle which is attractive to the female market.  Very easy to handle, park and drive.  The pros and cons are listed below, however  overall this is just an average SUV.  Not that I was thrilled with the Ford Explorer, but I think I would rather drive that than the Blazer.  Although the ride is smooth, the lack of room makes for an uncomfortable drive for more than 35 minutes or so.  The storage area in the back is not  too large and does not carry those oversize items that SUV's usually can fit.  The heating system is either too hot or too cold.  It is hard to get a comfortable temperature.  
My lease is up in 2001 and I think I will go for the Pathfinder this time.  I don't think the American manufacturers know how to combine the best of all worlds - comfort, driving ease and gas mileage.<br><br>
