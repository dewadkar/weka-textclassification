            I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, and I think it's great.  I have never had a major problem with it.  I just bring it in every so often to get checked up. I bring it to the Jeep dealership for service every time, and the staff is great.  They are very nice and they do a thorough and efficient job.  Actually, I think the greatest thing about owning this car is the service I receive.  It is always easy to get parts if you end up in a fender bender and oil changes are over before you can finish the coffee.  If you ever need to bring it in for overnight service, they'll even give you another Jeep to drive until yours is ready!

On the technical side, the Jeep drives well for a sport utility. I come from a long line of sport utilities too.  My family has owned Mercedes M classes, Izuzus, Ford Explorers, GMC Suburban, and Jeeps.   I must say that Jeep offers the most comfortable ride.  My Jeep has a 5.2 L V8 engine, and it has a great deal of power.  It's a little loud when starting up, but it drives great.  It is a quiet ride on the inside, so don't be worried.

My favorite aspect of the car is that it is extremely comfortable.  I have cushy leather seats that decline backwards until you are parallel with the ground.  If you are a passenger at night, say Good night! The seats also have lumbar support for those of you who have lower back problems. I hate sitting in the same place for long periods of time, but I can honestly say that I have never experience back pain in this car.

One issue of key importance to me when buying a car was the sound quality.  Jeeps come with Infinity Gold speakers.  I was a little skeptical about these at first, wanting Bose speakers myself, but they are great.  Sound is crisp and clear.  I also installed a CD player upon purchase; that's key.

I have put almost 40,000 miles on the car in two years, and I haven't had any major problems yet.  On long trips, it is really a pleasure to drive and there are sufficient cupholders! It is a durable, reliable car.<br><br>
