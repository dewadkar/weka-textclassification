            I bought this car back in the summer of '92, it had 18000 km on the odometer(11000miles). The V6 gives this car a lot of power for a car this size, although its a little heavy on gas now it seems. The rack and pinion steering seems a little stiff if your not used to it, but it allows for less wheel rotation when turning that with regular power steering.

The control console is driver centered making it easy to make music changes and air adjustments with losing focus on the road and the orange illuminated dash is easy to see at night without being harsh.

The engine compartment is well laid out, making oil changes a snap, it takes me about fifteen minutes, the oil filter is easy to reach without bending and twisting. The only real problem I've had so far is the alternator(I've gone through three), I've talked to other owners and they have had the same problem. For a car over nine years old repair cost have been pretty low compared to some horror stories I've heard and parts are always available cheap at your local scrap yard. 

I now have over 250000 km on the car (150000miles) and the motor is still running perfectly, regular maintenance helps. I had to have the air conditioning done this year but its to be expected in a car this old, overall I'd say for the price you can get this car for its well worth it. Take good care of it and it will last a long time. <br><br>
