             I have a 1995 two door 4 wheel drive tahoe. It is a 1995 and real sharp looking. (added nice wheels and large tires).  
After owning a landcruizer, a jeep pickup, I would say that with the added jet chip (about $200), adds about 25 horse and lots of torque. my tahoe will go anywhere and in comfort while listening to a cd. i recomend my tahoe to everyone. My 17 yr. old daughter say her friends think my tahoe is really cool. I bought it for $18,000 used and have had no problems. I took a one day cruize through the dessert and it did as well as anything out there( it was an organized trip with 20 vehicles)

   This SUV is wonderful on the road. We took it about 600 mile trip and it was like driving a cadillac. I would not drive anything else!
The only draw back is gas mileage, but it is worth the cost.
