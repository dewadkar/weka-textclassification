            Ever since <i>The Fast and the Furious</i>, lowered cars with modified body kits can be found everywhere.  Compact cars with loud exhausts and tricked-out tail lights are as popular today as airbrushed, shag-carpeted vans were in the '70s.  But what if you want your car to make a statement without having to be afraid of speed bumps or spend $2000 on stereo equipment?

The Corrado may just be your answer.  Make no mistake, the reason to buy this car is for it's style above all else.  There is nothing like it on the road, modified or no.  People will stare, unable to figure out what it is.  They'll ask you what it is, and then ask if it's "One of those new VW's?"  People behind you at stoplights will stare and gape as the rear spoiler raises and lowers - <i>by itself!</i>

The 1991 Corrado has a sleek, lucious body shape.  The front stance is low and agressive, and the waistline rises as it travels back, giving the rear a pleasing bulbous shape as the hatchback drops.  As a change from 1990, all 1991 models came standard with BBS alloy wheels, however many examples on the market will have other aftermarket wheels by now.  While it's hard to describe without seeing, one word can sum it up: beautiful.

I've been in the market for a Corrado for several months, and have done lots of resarch and asked lots of questions.  I've settled on the 1991 G60 for several reasons, beginning with the fact that the car was first introduced in 1990 and some minor bugs were ironed out by the second year.  In 1992, an additional model was added to the lineup, the 6-cylinder SLC, with slightly more agressive lines and a more powerful engine.  These models, hoever, are prohibitvely expensive.  A good condition Corrado SLC can fetch upwards of $10,000, and the prices on well-kept examples are actualy <b>rising</b>.  However, the G60 is comparatively cheap, running around $4000 for a 1991 model in excellent condition.

The G60 designation describes the engine, a unique powerplant for US Volkswagens.  It consists of a farily standard 1.8 liter 8 valve engine, similar to that found on Golfs and Jettas of the day.  However, the G in G60 stands for <b>G-lader</b>, the German term for the type of supercharger added to this engine.  The supercharger turns this ordinary 100 horsepower engine into a heavy-breathing, 158hp bahn burner.  Even better, it bumps torque up to a very healthy 165 lb-ft, giving the engine a healthy bottom end and making it a pleasure to drive around town or on the highway.

After having test-driven several examples of this car, I've come to a conclusion that will help anyone planning to buy one.  <b>Don't settle!</b>  Because they are hard to find, you may be eager to pick up the first one you see.  However, the Corrado's performance and reliability depends a great deal upon how it has been taken care of previously, and how you will take care of it in the future.  If you can find one being sold by the original owner, try to find one that has papers covering all of the major repairs done.  Also, prepare to put some extra time into preventative maintenance to keep it trouble-free.

The interior of the Corrado is much like the interior of the first generation Passat (which was also introduced in the US in 1990).  Seats are molded comfortably, and slide forward and tilt back with simple hand controls.  Some loaded Corrados have 6-way power seats, however this is more common on the later SLC models.  HVAC and other controls are large and easy to find without taking your eyes off the road.  The stereo is conveniently located directly above the HVAC, and the gauge cluster is intelligently laid out and well-lit as well.  Corrados are also equipped with an 'MFA' trip computer, which will read out on a digital display your current miles traveled, fuel mileage, oil temperature, and average speed, all on the fly.

The front seats are spacious and comfortable, with plenty of head and leg room.  However, the backseat is strictly for children or amputees; if the driver is taller than 5'10", there is no backseat legroom.  The hatchback opens wide, allowing access to a surprising amount of trunk space.  Luggage for two will easily fit with plenty of room left.

The Corrado is built relatively safely for it's time.  It comes with automatic seatbelts standard, four-wheel disc brakes with optional anti-lock brakes, however no airbags are avilable.  It is engineered with a reinforced safety cage and front crumple zones, which help to keep you safe in a hard impact.  However, compared to modern vehicles the Corrado is somewhat lacking in safety features.

What it lacks in safety, it makes up in fun.  The Corrado has a low stance and a sporty suspension, and this shows on the road.  Cornering is effortless, and the steering and acceleration feedback is excellent; you can feel exactly what is going on between your foot and the road.  While the G60's modest power is average compared to modern cars - 0-60mph comes up in just over 7 seconds - it's enough to make freeway driving feel effortless along with the comfortable interior.  The Corrado is more a 'sport luxury coupe' (what 'SLC' stands for, in fact), and while the suspension is geared toward sporty handling, it also provides a smooth, comfortable cruising ride.  And for an extra trick, the rear spoiler automatically raises itself at 35 mph and retracts again at low speeds.

Of couse, all this makes the Corrado sound like the perfect compact car, even on a budget.  Well, I mentioned above that reliability depends greatly on previous care.  If this car is abused, it will show it quickly.  The basic mechanics of the car will stand up for a long time - engine block, transmission, steering linkage.  However, there are some parts that don't take a beating well.  The supercharger in particular can take over 150,000 miles if cared for properly, but 50,000 or less othwerise.  The heater core is notorious for failing spectacularly, and should be examined, or better yet repaired before buying.  Minor mechanicals, like the sunroof and rear spoiler (which is mechanically activated) can also fail and require repair.  All minor mechanical parts should be thoroughly checked over, as well as all fuses and relays, before purchase.  However, if all of these are covered - supercharger, heater core, mechanicals, as well as a good once over and a tune up - the car will reward you greatly if you provide a bit of TLC.

The second downside is that finding someone who knows VW's is a neccessity for repairing these cars, and the dealers often can't help with older models.  Plus, parts are quite expensive, so try not to get any dents or dings. 

I frequent a mechanic who specializes in VW's, and has for over 20 years.  After many talks with him, my plan is to have him find a car in good condition for me, and then we have a list of items that will be worked on.  The supercharger will be rebuilt, the heater core replaced if it needs to be, all electric motors checked over, and any other repairs needed.  After lots of consideration, we've determined that all this, including the purchase of the car, can be done for around $5,500.  This is still a bargain any way you look at it.

Unfortunately, with all this car offers, I cannot recommend it to everyone even while I give it 4 stars.  This car is for someone who loves their vehicle, and doesn't mind spending a little extra time caring for it.  The Corrado, while an extremely rewarding coupe to own, does require a bit more maintenance from it's owner than the average car.  However, I do highly recommend it to anyone who wants something unique, something that will stand out among 'The Loud and the Lowered', and something that is uniquely fun to drive.
