            I�ve owned this car for about two months now, and I�m convinced I made the right decision. I�m stationed in Great Britain so I have the opportunity to take advantage of the loose traffic regulations�more about that later! I have a WS-6 Trans Am, Navy Blue, Ebony Interior, Hurst 6 spd Shift, w/Targa Tops and 12 Disk CD Changer.
	Performance: Aggressive, responsive, fast, reliable. The WS-6 option makes a difference not only for looks but for its meatier performance. A good mash on the throttle will, traction permitting, bolt you forward with an impressive American V-8 roar. Solid chirp into 2nd up to around 65mph, and row into 3rd with a lurch that will pull you just over 100mph, pull back into 4th and hold on to something as it effortlessly takes you up to 125mph. Shift on up to 5th and smoothly roll on up to 150, slightly nervously passing trucks and a few cars seeing those nostrils up front glaring behind them, pull it back into 6th for a quick coasting speed. At 155 your tach should be resting at around 4800 with a little room for improvement. I honestly have not tried to move it faster, I�m always where I�m going in a few minutes. Not to mention those cursed speed cameras over here (Get ready US, they�re coming).
	Handling: Dry pavement, watch me fly by. The tires, tuned suspension, and the spoiler (Yes, spoiler- Imagine that, a car that actually uses what it�s made for, not just a $50 bolt-on for a 180 horse station wagon) all work together to keep you firmly planted on the asphalt even at high speeds, and tight turns. Wet pavement, watch me drive like a cop is in the area. This car will spin you around quickly if you try to punch it going around a corner. Go ahead and go fast around it, the tires won�t break loose. The moment you step on it in a tight corner (Parking lots, sharp city turns), say �Hi� to the guy behind you for me, you�ll be looking right at him. Rough or gravel roads? You�ll by this car to drive it, take the longer route. The tight suspension will bounce you all over the road, and the wide tires will throw every rock they find.  
	Styling: I cannot really comment on this, you�ve seen the pictures. Is it too much? Does it look like something you want to take to the grocery store? Does your life-style put you in situations you don�t want everybody knowing where you are? Do you really want a car you have to wash everyday because people will most certainly be looking? It all works for me. This is a car that says �Shut up and look at me,� and it does it in a low demonic voice. 
	Interior: Leather seating and controls are great (never-mind it�s not the best leather). 17 pounds of plastic in the rest of the car though. Kind of disappointing actually. And if you thought the Monsoon 10 spkr system equaled performance, try again. I�ve already replaced the entire system with a quality one. The advertisement that it was a four passenger vehicle? I�ll apologize for Pontiac. It�s a 2 person up front and a 9 year old with a growing impediment in the back. The mandatory (darn environment) catalytic converter in the passenger side floorboard presents an issue for tall people. I didn�t buy it to cart around a family though. Neither should you. All that aside, I�ve never felt more comfortable. The driver�s side and most of the front passenger side is designed to keep you in sporty comfort and to hold you tight. It feels like a cockpit should.
         Weigh it smartly, it�s a great car for a person that either has two cars, or someone without a family who wants a vehicle, for looks, performance, modifications, or to hurt gas supplies. It�s not for everyone but it is most certainly the car for me.
