            I've had my 2000 Montero Sport LS for four months now, and am very happy with it.  This is an excellent vehicle.  Overall it does so very well in every category that it would be easiest just to point out the very minor shortcomings, nevertheless I will give fair attention to the &quot;goodness&quot; which is so readily apparent.

It handles well, brakes well, rides nicely, is quiet, the seats are comfortable, driving position is good, visibility is good.  Sticks to the road and requires very little effort to drive.  The wipers work well as do the headlights.  The engine and drive train perform well.  The horn is a wee bit tiny.  Gets reasonably good mileage.  Gives the sense that the mechanical components are supremely well designed. 

It has a very nicely appointed interior, which is tastefully designed and consists of high quality materials.  It just feels rather luxurious.  The six speaker sound system is surprisingly satisfying.  Good sized glove box.  Attractive exterior styling appears both elegant and poised maintaining a balance between smoothness and aggressive good looks.  

Now, the things I'd wish for...  Remember, these things should be considered minor enhancements.

* A more powerful engine.  It has adequate acceleration, sufficient and safe.  Step on it, and it fairly jumps forward but it feels like you're straining.  Regular pick up from stops in traffic just feels a little slow.  Not the boy racer I find myself craving, of course, it really is a large, solidly built truck after all.

* Less lean in turns and perhaps more lateral support in the seats.  There is a good strong tug on you when you turn corners.  That of course is largely due to the tall stance of the vehicle, but I wouldn't consider giving up sitting in the clouds.

* Maybe a more powerful stereo.  Don't get me wrong, it has a good stereo system... It's just not quite concert hall sound.

* Possibly a thermostatically controlled air conditioning system.  I live in a warm climate, and the A/C often seems to be either too much or too little.

Note that the XLS model comes with an upgraded sound system and a slightly larger engine (200hp)!  Could very well be worth the extra expense.

I purchased an SUV for the benefits of sitting higher and having a better view, as well as for the added safety garnered from increased size.  Along with that, the large cargo and seating capacity is a real positive.
In the end, I got just what I wanted.  So, anyone looking for a solid contender with a fine reliability record, should experience this one in person.
