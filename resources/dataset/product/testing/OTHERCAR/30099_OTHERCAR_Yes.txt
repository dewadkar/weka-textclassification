            This camera takes great pictures.  However, there are pro's and con's to this model.  

Pro's first: it takes a 2.3 mega-pixel picture, thus ensuring a great quality picture.  It has digital zoom, which is a plus when taking pictures.   The LCD display and menus are great and is a very user-friendly feature.  The ability to review pictures and either save or delete them on the spot (no need to plug it into the computer first) make it easy to keep open space on the memory card.  The removable memory card is another nifty feature because you can add extra cards, and the USB support if the fastest I've seen.

Cons: price!  This isn't a cheap little camera.  Also, it's bulky-much heavier than the regular 35mm.  Although the rechargeable batteries are nice, they are also a necessity because the camera drains them dry (quite quickly).  The LCD is a great feature, but is sometimes hard to read outdoors.
