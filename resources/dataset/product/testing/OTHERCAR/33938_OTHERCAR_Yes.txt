            Why did I buy this car?  
I am very impressed with the TDI New Beetle mainly because I am very concerned about saving my hard earned money, from an environmental standpoint, the engine burns clean, and the New Beetle is a very safe car to drive.  When I am driving around town I get very close to 45 miles per gallon, on the highway the fuel economy is about 55 miles per gallon.  I don't have a heavy foot.  So I get the most mpg that I can.  The mpg's will be a bit less in the winter months because the diesel fuel is conditioned.  All of the crash tests that I have read praise the New Beetle for it's saftey.  
Because this is a diesel engine and NOT a gasoline engine tune-ups as we know them to be, are very different.  A tune up for a diesel engine basically consists of changing the fuel filters and changing the oil. Very inexpensive to maintain.  Diesel fuel costs about the same as unleaded gasoline.
The TDI being a turbo diesel is very fast.  I like the fact that the TDI diesels do not smell or emit any soot like the old diesels did in the past.
At first I thought the car was small inside; but once I drove the car and had to carry some things, I realized how tremendous the trunk really is.
The back seats also fold down to augment the capacity of the trunks capacity.
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO DRIVE THIS CAR?
This car is so much fun to drive.  Everybody stares at you when your driving.  The car handles really nice.  It's almost like driving a sports car.  When your at a stop and go light and really have to accelerate.  The power is there!  Accessing onto the expressway is never a problem.  
I love all aspects of this vehicle.  The car gets excellent fuel economy, it's very safe to drive, and doesn't pollute the air like older diesels.
I call this a very efficient energy saving vehicle.  
WHO SHOULD BUY THIS CAR?
Everybody should buy this car.  Why do I say this?  I say this because this vehicle is very inexpensive to maintain.  The diesel engine has been totally redesigned.  Many people shy away from buying diesels engine cars because they are afraid that they will not be able to find diesel fuel.  I'd like to say that this is my 5th diesel engine car.  I never had any problem finding diesel fuel.  You learn where all the stations are.  All last winter I drove my NB thru the heavy snowfall and never got stuck.  I also never had any problems starting my diesel.  My car sits out in the cold all day long.  My TDI started up everyday in winter without any problems.  The tires that come with the car are Michelin.  I was amazed at how well the tires performed.

My only complaint.  
When I drive on a long trip of 300 plus miles.  I recommend a small pillow be placed at the small of the back.  I learned this from my friend who has a different make of car.  The seats are fairly similar.  He told me to buy a small pillow for long trips.  He was right.  That small pillow performed well.
