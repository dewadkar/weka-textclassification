            I bought this camera after my Agfa 780C LCD screen started freezing.  I returned that camera and bought the D-360L, which is a great camera.  The D-360L takes great photos.  I love the fact that you can change the camera settings depending on different situations you may encounter when shooting.  

The camera is pretty simple to use, although, I must warn you about the LCD on/off button.  To turn it on, press it gently, wait a second, and it will come on.  When I first tried to turn it on to view the pictures I had taken, I pressed it, seen nothing, pressed it again, and by the second press, it had came on and went back off.  Just be patient, and you will get used to it.  

That is about the only fault I can find with this camera.  Oh by the way, you have to close the shutter (turn the camera off) before you can view the pics you have taken on the LCD.  This is a little time consuming, but nothing major.

The macro mode is great, just view the flower from this link: http://images.ofoto.com/photos11/2/88/41/68/7/0/7684188203_0_ALB.jpg?v=0 and notice the detail on the flower.  The wind was blowing, so the whole flower didn't get photographed, but it shows the detail nicely.  The print quality is nice, digital zoom is helpful, features are great, size is nice, and price is really good--you can't go wrong with this camera.<br><br>
