            The odometer just turned 150, so in all reality I shouldn't be writing a review on this car yet, but what the heck.  I'll come back and let everyone know how it's doing in 3-4 months too.

This SUV is a hidden treasure.  It's amazing how few people have even heard of it, which makes me feel all the more lucky to have discovered it.   Let me go on a little SUV rant here:  Most fall into these categories:

1.  It's a station wagon with big tires.
2.  It's a pick up truck with a shell and the rear window knocked out.
3.  It's an armor personnel carrier.
4.  It's a full flung tank.

Having gotten that rant out.

1.  I didn't want a station wagon.  I want a car that I can take to the Home Depot and not worry about fitting everything.  It's got to be able to hold my hockey gear and my golf clubs AT THE SAME TIME.  When I head out camping it should hold everything I need without having to attach a trailer.

2.  I've owned a pick up.  Had one when I was 19.  It was fun - when I was 19.  My friends now aren't wild about riding in the back of a pick up.  I need something a little more grown up.  Leather seats, Climate controls, Bose stereos, you know - grown up things.

3.  Armor personnel carriers belong in the Army.  I'm a big guy.  6'3&quot; 250lb's  I need a car I'm comfortable in, which is hard to do.  But, I've never felt the need to have my car compensate for my anatomy, if you get my drift.  It needs to fit in the garage.  Why the hell would anyone pay $30k + for a car they have to leave outside all the time???

4.  This new urban tank thing really cracks me up.  You know the old joke about Volvos was that the only people who bought them were rich white guys who knew their wives were a danger on the road.  The logic being that at least when they crashed into something, they'd live.  Those guys don't buy Volvos now they buy Suburbans.  My wife drives just fine.  No need to buy her a tank.

So that leaves a small class of SUV I'm looking for.  Big enough to handle all the suburban warrior tasks I'll have for it, not so big I'm a driving a cliche.  Comfortable, grown up, with all the bells and whistles anyone could want.

Which is why the Envoy was the perfect fit.  It's not too small, but not too big.  It actually fits in the garage thanks to those cool flip down side mirrors.  It's got every little luxury and convenience item you could use, and even some you can't use (The heated seat thing is really cool).  It's as if you walked into the Chevy dealer and said &quot;Give me a Blazer with every option available&quot;.  No wait, it's not like that, it is that.

It's up against a small group at that point, Lexus (the big one, not the 4 wheel drive station wagon), M Class, BMW, Toyota Limited, Grand Cherokee and a few others.  For me it easily beat the imports.  It has everything they have for 20k less. So it really comes down to taste and style.  The two tone leather and wood trim make the inside, and I've always preferred GM's rounded exterior style to the more box like Toyota, Explorer or Jeep.

If you're down in your decision process to an Explorer, a Grand Cherokee, a Jimmy, a Lexus, or an M class, seek out the Envoy.  You won't have wasted your time.
