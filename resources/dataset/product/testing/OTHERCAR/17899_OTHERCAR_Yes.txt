            In March of 1998 I purchased my 22nd Cadillac DeVille, trading in the 1995 model.  The '98 model is by far the nicest car that I have ever owned and the local dealership always gives me excellent service.  I believe in taking the car in to the dealer from whom I purchased it for all types of service including oil changes.  This car has all the features that I could possibly ask for and it is a pleasure to drive it. I particularly enjoy the plush interior with the leather seats and I also always notice the mileage I am getting which is shown on the dashboard.  It is also nice to be able to see the outside and inside temperature at all times.  I have already looked at the new 2000 year models, which were recently introduced and the main improvement I can see in them, other than the styling changes, is that Cadillac has improved the engine to operate on regular gasoline which is another plus.  I am so pleased with the Cadillac cars I have had and the service that I have received from my local dealer that I would never even think of looking at another brand.<br><br>
