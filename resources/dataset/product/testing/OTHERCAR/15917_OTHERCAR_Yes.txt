            12,000 miles is approaching! AHH! "Do you think we should stop driving it?" says my Grandmother..."Um...no" says I.

First off, I have to honestly say that if you have a Mercury Sable that's in better condition, let me know! I'll also say that the car isn't personally mine, but in a way it is. My grandma just makes the payments. I have been with it since Day 1. Bought in early May of 2000, it is now January 20, 2002...and the car has roughly 11,500 miles on it. She babies the car and loves it more than nearly everything [except for ME of course ;) ]. This is by far the best car she has ever bought. I can honestly say that this car has had such a positive impact on my Grandmother, it helped pull her out of a depressive state she was in. Who knew a the car could do such a thing? Well, anyway, onto the car. At least 6 people have come up to us saying how nice of a car we have. It still looks like it's BRAND new. I personally spend 2 hours cleaning it quite frequently. We went to the dealership with my Grandma's heart set on a new black Taurus. I saw the Sable sitting there, and thought it actually looked better than the Taurus. Then I saw the sticker, and it was REALLY nicer than the Taurus. After 15 minutes of convincing, my Grandma took it out. She IMMEDIATELY said "WOW...I like this car." It rode awesome, handled very well, had awesome features, and was by far better looking than a lot of the BLAH we see around town these days. For a sticker price of less than $22,000, it's a steal. This one is done in bright silver with dark gray leather. It's a nice combination, makes the car look even nicer.

This car is the highest trim level (why get anything lower?), the LS Premium Touring Edition. I am VERY into cars, and take pride in the fact I could go on for hours about them. I am VERY picky when it comes to cars, and this one still makes me smile when I see it. 

Onto the features...leather, power moonroof, fully electronic climate control, power everything (mirrors, windows, locks, driver seat), heated outside mirrors, 16" rims, ABS w/ brake distribution, rear defog, 60/40 split folding rear seats, foglights, keyless entry/alarm/outside keypad, adjustable pedals (fun to play with), and even more I just can't think of. All for $21,915, who wouldn't go for that? Before this car my Grandma detested leather, now she won't have anything less. All the Sables in the lot (O.K. there were 3) were equipped the same. I would have liked to have had some of the other available options like the MACH stereo, traction control, side airbags, or dual power seats...but I'm not complaining.

The seats are comfortable, the ride is good, the car handles great, VERY quick and responsive, and the car loves to rev. Safety? 5 stars, all the way. I just hope I'll never find out first hand how safe the car really is. Also, I think it's a Ford thing again, unlike GM you can actually turn off the auto headlights! But if you have on the auto headlights, you can't have the foglights on? Anyway, I have VERY few complaints about this car. I personally drive it on a regular basis and get depressed when I have to drive something else. I must also say if you are not the biggest fan of the back end, put on a spoiler! I made my Grandma and she's had even more good comments. I must say I brag about the car 24/7 and when people ask me what it is they are astonished to hear what I say. Then I go into my 5 minute speech on why I love the car.

Alright, now mind you I can probably find something wrong with every car in the world. This car merely has a few tiny things that I would have changed had I engineered the car(maybe most will be gone if she buys a new one in 2003). The stock stereo is kind of sad. It's not the worst I've ever heard, but I'd honestly say go for the MACH. There's no standard CD, something that surprised me. The only option is the quite expensive MACH system w/ the CD changer in the trunk (her Taurus had it) which sounds pretty decent. We were actually steered away from it by the dealer, who lied and said we could have a changer installed later for cheaper. I want to hit them for that, now. I just find it quirky how Cavaliers and other tiny econo-box cars have standard CD's and this one doesn't, oh well. My second quirk must be a Ford thing, because in our Expedition it's the same way. The car has the auto shifter on the floor, but for some reason the turn signal lever houses about 10,000 functions. Thank God it's not like GM where the headlights and/or cruise control are on it too. I think I'd go insane. It also looks slightly odd with just one lever on the column, but I didn't even notice it until a few months ago. Just a tiny pet peeve only I would pick out. Another thing, where's the rear seat headrests? I know the older ones had them, I wonder why they took them away? Where you put your head is quite hard in the back, and screams "bring a pillow." Also a gripe my Grandma has is the HUGE front headrests, she says she can't see past them. I haven't had a problem with them personally. The rear brakes are drum, but the braking is still quite decent. Oh, and the older models had dual exhaust, where'd that go? I thought that was kind of cool, I mean, now-a-days they'll throw dual exhaust on a golf cart, why not this car? One last oddity that I'm sure the normal person could care less about...plain gauges. I like Pontiac's red backlighting and the different styles Nissan offers. But (another Ford thing) the Sable is contemporary, plane-jane green. They display the gauges nicely, but I guess not "sporty" enough, I feel, for the car.

Now that I've written a novel, I will say we have had NO problems with this car, except for one tiny thing. I was skeptical a bit at first because they totally re-designed the car and this was the first year, and I was afraid the car would be trouble, but it has proved me wrong. The problem, however, was explained by the dealer as "You pumped the brakes", but we don't know for sure. On the test drive, when she was stopping, the car came to about 10MPH and then started (apparently) shifting down, sending the car into a rodeo bucking contest. We were both quite surprised, and a bit scared. FINALLY, the car stopped...but about 6 inches from ramming into the car in front of us. It's only done that twice since then, and my Grandma says she indeed does think it was because she pumped the brakes.  (We just stop farther back...and another note, it has never done that when I have been driving it) The car also had 2 very minor recalls, fixed without a problem. One last thing was the power steering fluid tube was too small, causing the engine to "sing" (if you will) at idle. Don't ask me, haha, I didn't see the harm in it really. The oil is changed every 3,000 miles, and again I believe this is one of the nicest ones around. It even has a Teflon finish where the exterior is supposed to keep its glossy shine for 5 years. After the lease (why she leased it, don't ask me) I am going out of my way to get this car. (Also, a side note, while my Grandma was having the oil changed a worker at the dealership tried getting her to take his number so he could buy the car after the lease! But my loving Grandmother pulled through, and told him it was reserved for me.) I love this car, I'd recommend it to anyone!

Thanks for reading!
