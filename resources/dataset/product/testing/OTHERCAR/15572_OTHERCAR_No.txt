            While this is really an attractively styled, roomy SUV, it was not the SUV I bought after exhaustively researching the field, and driving each vehicle several times.

Strong points for the Montero Sport: Bold styling, roomy interior, high ride height, comfortable seats, lots of options.

Weak points: Weak base engine, base model lacks ABS brakes, difficult two-step process to fold down rear seats, pricey when optioned out.

The Sport uses the old-fashioned recirculating ball steering system, unlike almost all of its competition. It doesn't feel much different, but it is a bit less responsive than rack and pinion. The ride is soft, and there is some body roll, which is not surprising in a big long SUV like this.

While I liked the bold styling, I questioned whether it will still look good in 5 years. The SUV I bought has definitely aged well, and when you look at a 93 or 94, the styling still looks fresh. Older Mitsubishis look like... well, old Mitsubishis.

I liked the interior styling, which was more luxurious than many. But the rear seats have the two-tep system for folding the seats down, leaving the top of the seat bottom against the front seats. This feature makes it difficult to quickly put those seats down to accomodate big cargo or extra dogs.

In the end, I chose the Chevy Blazer base with a 5 speed, which was priced thousands less, and included such necessities as 4 wheel anti-lock brakes, aluminum road wheels, AM/FM cassette and roof rack. See my review of the Blazer under &quot;99 Blazer- great value&quot;<br><br>
