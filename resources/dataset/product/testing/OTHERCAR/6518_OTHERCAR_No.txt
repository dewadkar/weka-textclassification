            I have a new used 1995 Volvo 960 that I absolutely adore! Several of my friends have Volvos and have been very pleased. Volvo is one of the most durable safe vehicles on the road today. When a friend of mine was in a car wreck last summer, being in a Volvo is literally what saved their lives! I love the style that will never go out of date also. The luxury of the leather, all electrical, sunroof, and smooth steering sold my husband and myself on the overall purchase of our Volvo. The 960 series was recommended for the added size and power which we love! Since we bought our car used, we did not have to pay the high price for a luxury car, yet we drive in style! I am sold 100% on the trusted name of Volvo and will continue to purchase Volvos in the future.<br><br>
