            I got my Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-700 on sale for 250 dollars at Wal-Mart a few months ago. First off the quality is real good. I know it�s not a Mega pixel, but come on now, do you really need images that take forever to load and hard to transfer around. The great thing about this camera it is in the middle class, it is  not the low end 640x480 cameras and it is not the high end Mega pixel cameras. 

The quality is very good, it has a memory slot, comes with great software, and best of all its comes with all the cables you need. The bad things it�s slow. It takes like a minute for each picture to upload to the computer via serial port, and to the get LCD to come on you got to wait a few seconds. One thing I have noticed on mine is a hole that said USB but theirs nothing there. Maybe Polaroid has or had plans on a USB version. I have e-mail them a couple times about this and they never e-mailed me back. Well all in all a few months ago I would have highly recommended it. I still do only if you find  it cheaper then 250 bucks. Because I have seen Mega Pixel USB Cameras for about 299 dollars, and trust me that USB makes it worth the extra money.


Pros 
Great Camera, and Great quality
Good software package
Comes with every thing you need including name brand batteries.

Cons
A little to slow to transfer pictures 
Needs a USB connection. 
Newer cameras have past this one bye (sorry Polaroid) :(
