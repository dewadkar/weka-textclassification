            Recently, my Jeep Cherokee was in an auto accident. While it was being fixed, the insurance agency gave me a 1999 Chevy Suburban to drive. When I bought my Jeep, I didn't even look at the Suburban - I thought it was too big, but I've begun to change my mind. 

Although it is a huge vehicle, which makes it difficult to park and drive in some city situations, it spacious interior makes the best of the size. The third back seat is great when you have a couple of kids or you are entertaining family. I drove the car for several weeks and got used to parking and driving it in &quot;small car situations&quot;. 

The interior is excellent, both in features and size. Plenty of cup holders and areas to put general stuff you carry around with you. The heating/air conditioning system is split between a front seat and rear seat controller, which was beneficial. It had comfortable seats with a driver's seat that seemed to be just the right height - and the back was big enough to stretch out (unlike other SUV's).

Again, the main drawback is overall size, but this can also be a pro. My wife felt very safe in the vehicle and other drivers tend to be nicer when you're driving a car this size. We only got about 12 miles to the gallon, but we drove it in primarily city situations. And this one did not have 4 wheel drive.

Overall, I'd rate it high. Every car has a couple of drawbacks and I tend to think the interior space makes up for the size restraints.<br><br>
