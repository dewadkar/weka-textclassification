            What a terrific camera. It can really do just about everything. Great still shots, with or without sound, and those 15 second movie clips, terrific.
I fly radio control model planes, and one of the first things I did was to take movie clips of my fellow club members flying. When I get home I simply put the clips in my computer and email them to the 'pilots'.
One club member tells me that when the weather is bad and he can't go flying, he simply just watches some 'clips' and feels better about the day.
I can't say too much about the quality or IMPORTANCE of the sound this unit captures.....It is unreal.
A good friend of mine, after receiving several movie clips ran out and bought himself a digital. Spent almost as much money as I did, but made the serious mistake of getting a camera that takes terrific pictures &amp; movie clips, but forgot about SOUND!The dealer he was at sold him an Olympus and was such a good salesman that the sound wasn't mentioned until after the sale. If you think it isn't important, just go watch something on tv with the sound shut off!
I also bought a wide angle lens and some filters. The wide angle lens is a 'pip' I have never had so much fun with a camera before.














Want a great camera, get yourself a Sony S-70.<br><br>
