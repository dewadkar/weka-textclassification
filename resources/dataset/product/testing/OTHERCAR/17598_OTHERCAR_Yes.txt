            First and foremost, my husband and I bought this vehicle because it was within the price range we wanted to pay ($12,000). At first site, we were very skeptical because we live in Alaska and must travel on dark, snowy, icy roads for many months in the year and this is a pretty small car. Now, I have to say that it is the best economy car we have ever purchased. It holds the road very nicely on ice and snow(even without studded tires). It's front wheel drive, which is great in the winter. It is a lot like driving a sport car in its' handling and road hugging, yet is very comfortable inside. The car is quite spacious in both front and back and very comfortable for long trips. The interior is what we would consider on the plushier side, very comparable to the luxury cars. It has reclining bucket seats with soft fabric, tilt steering, cruise control, air conditioning, AM/FM Stereo with CD Player and gets 30 to 33 MPG. In fact, we are so impressed with this car, that we intend to pass it to our daughter when she turns 16 for her to use to go to and from school and work. That in itself says a lot about the car because no parent wants to send their child out on the highway on dark, icy roads (especially a daughter)in an unreliable vehicle. This car seems to attract all age groups to. We have seen everyone from senior citizens to teenagers driving them. I guess that's because they are a fun, yet easy to drive vehicle and they are comfortable and nice looking as well. I guess you could say &quot;Stylin'! As a final note I want to add: My husband asked what kind of 'rig' I want when we pass the Neon down to our daughter? Sport Utility? Luxury car? Truck? Well, to my surprise, I found myself telling him that I wanted another Neon :) This car may not be everyones' forte' but I highly recommend people at least check it out!<br><br>
