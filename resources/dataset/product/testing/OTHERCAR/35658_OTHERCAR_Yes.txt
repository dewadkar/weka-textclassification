            This is my third Japanese Sport coupe, going first with the Mitsu Starion, to a Subaru SVX, and now a 03 Accord coupe.
I went into the dealer with no intention of buying this car, the dealer was offering 50 bucks for a test drive.  The car had me in five minutes.  My last car, a Toyota Avalon was giving me terrible back pains in commute traffic, this little sports coupe has the best seats I have come across, an hour in traffic is no trouble at all.

I have never liked Hondas and the 03 Accord Sedan with its strange tail lights is a complete turn off.  The coupe looks completely different, part Mercedes in the rear, the sides of an Acura RSX, and a clean front.  I opted for the Cheap version, LX, but went for the V6 option.  My cheap version came with a 6 cd changer, power everything, traction control, ABS, V6, and 16" wheels with hubcaps.  I bought some RSX wheels on ebay for $200.00 and decided the car needs nothing else.

I am more impressed with this car every day.  The 240 HP moves the car with great power, and it handles like a dream.  The surprise is that this car is pretty big.  I have parked next to the Nissan 350Z and Acura RSX, and both look like they could fit in my trunk.  After a month I still have to be careful to keep my cruising speed below 90 MPH, the car makes very little noise, and the wind does not seem to touch it.  My first week with it in Miami was one of our famous floods, putting enough water on the road to make waves.  I plowed through the water with complete security, much more so than I had with my all wheel drive Subaru.  

The materials inside feel rich and the led dash lights up bright enough to give you a tan on a dark day.  The AC, which I like cold is usually on the second notch of 10.  The stereo which looks great, plays good, but could be better.  It is just so pretty I could not consider an after market upgrade.  Note that if you are cheap like me, and go for the LX, you lose the temp readout and digital AC.

As far as size I took the family to the tint shop, two kids in the back in big car seats, and we fit without a strain.  I would not want to have to put the kids back there everyday but if you have to it is no problem.  The seats also fold down which let me put a six foot long package through to the front seat with no problems.

The controls on the steering wheel do not light up.  After a few weeks I know where they are from touch, but the first few weeks were a bit of a pain.  The fit and finish of the car is incredible.  If you told me I was in a 50,000 car I could believe it.  I can honestly say, this is the finest car I have ever owned.  My SVX had twice the toys, and much more tech, but the Honda just feels better.  I have never owned a Honda, probably because the resale is too high, and I usually buy used.  This one got me to buy new.  What a wonderful car!!
