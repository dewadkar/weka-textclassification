            I have owned my Liberty Renegade for over four months and have over 12k trouble-free miles on it.  The vehicle has lived up to all my expectations.

I currently use the vehicle for a long commute everyday, (approximately 100 miles one way).  It has proven to be comfortable and smooth on the highways.  The gas mileage on the highway has been approximately 20.5 mpg with my city driving averaging 17 mpg. The engine is strong, handling is nimble because of the short wheel base, and the braking is quick due to the four wheel discs.  The part-time four wheel drive system has performed admirably during the heavy snows and ice here this past winter.  Slipping on wet/icy roads is minimal due to the excellent weight distribution between the front and rear.

Aside from commuting, I also use my Liberty to haul my 17 foot kayak on top with a bike mounted on the rear tire.  Meanwhile, all my gear is stored safely inside behind the backseat.  The storage area behind the rear seat has proven to be sufficient, and I appreciate the resultant shorter length when driving on fire roads or while parallel parking in town.

As of yet, I have not needed to use the off-road lights, but will be thankful for them someday soon while searching for a campground at night in the middle of the woods when I invariable arrive later than expected.  The fog lights have been effective during the couple of serious fogs I have driven through.

I trully admire the interior of the Renegade.  It has minimal metal trim which accentuates the dark gray (very close to black) interior nicely.  All of the gauges are easy to read and the controls easy to reach.  The Infinity sound system with the in-dash 6CD player is very good as well as convenient.

Of course there are some conditions which could use a little improvement - most of which are minor in severity.  The headlights are not as effective as I would expect.  Although the front seats are comfortable, I would prefer longer thigh coverage.  The rear seats do not fold flat, which can be a hindrance with some items.  Lastly, my biggest complaint would have to be the windshield which seem to get small chips from even the tiniest and slowest of normal roadway projectiles.

Overall, my Liberty Renegade is a great vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV to serve many purposes.
