            Recently my wife and I drove to Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  From where we live this is about 1800 mile round trip.  Our car is getting on the older side so we thought it would be nice to rent a car and not worry about it.  We originally wanted a full size car but when we went to pick up the car all they had was a <b>2001 Chevrolet Cavalier</b>.  We weren�t thrilled to say the least but we took it, as we had to leave that morning.  The car was fairly new, having only 9,000 miles, so we did hold on to some hope.

By the end of our 10 days with the car we came to one conclusion.  The <b>Cavalier</b> is great for city travel but not suited to long distance travel.

<b>Comfort</b>

For short trips the seats are very comfortable.  They are not as small as other cars I have been and the design of the car does not have everything shoved right in on the driver.  There is some room to stretch when at a red light and not having to worry about hitting anything.  

On a longer trip the problems begin to show up.  The first problem is that while the seats are bigger than most the padding is rather thin.  After a few hours sitting in them you begin to feel how hard the seat really is.  Second problem has to do with legroom.  On long trips your left leg can become sore.  No place exists where a person can put their leg without it hitting something hard.  This isn�t a problem on short trips because the leg will not be there as long.  The backseat is also a bit shy on the padding.

I would like to mention the fact that the air conditioner is the best I have ever used in a car before.  It is cold almost instantly and never seems to lose any intensity.

<b>Handling</b>

The <b>Cavalier</b> handles quite well for a compact car.  I never felt like it was going to go out of control no matter how sharp the turn or when I had to swerve unexpectedly.

Acceleration is a bit on the slow side but I did not expect anything but that from a small car.  The brakes work extremely well.  They respond with barely any pressure at all being applied to them.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>

Just a few things to know about the <b>Cavalier</b>.  

The radio will stay on until the door is opened when the car is turned off.  This confused me a bit when I first parked.

The car has daytime running lights.  I don�t care one way or another but some people do not like them.

The car will knock if you use 87-octane gas.

The trunk is not very large so do not take a lot unless you can pack some in the backseat.
