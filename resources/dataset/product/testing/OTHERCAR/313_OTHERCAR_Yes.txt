            I almost felt guilty buying an Xterra.  Having seen Nissan's unapologetic &quot;this-truck-will-turn-you-into-a-mountain-man&quot; brochures and commercials, I felt like I was being a sucker for jumping onto what seems to be the latest bandwagon of Generation-X trendiness.

But there really is a surprising amount of substance behind the Xterra's popularity.  I bought mine in June and since then have been beating it up pretty regularly, taking it off-road quite a few times and racking up 9,000 miles in only three months.  I've had literally no problems at all - everything is still sturdy and working perfectly.

The price was probably the biggest draw for me.  The upper-end SE model is a great deal, with A/C, power windows and doors, remote keyless entry, tilt-up sunroof, roof rack, 6-speaker stereo (with both CD and cassette), and a V6 for about $25,000.  This is about $10,000 less than a comparable Pathfinder, 4Runner, or Montero.  Granted you can't get leather seats or wood trim on an Xterra, but do you really need those?

Interior room is great, much more spacious than any of the other models I test-drove (especially the 4Runner), and surprising considering the truck's relatively small appearance from the outside.  You can take the rear seat cushions all the way out, allowing the rear seats to fold down completely flat for more cargo space.  I've slept pretty comfortably in the back several times when I've been on the road and arrived at a campsite too late at night to set up a tent easily.

The seats are very comfortable, even on really long driving days.  Controls on the dashboard are laid out simply and intuitively, and the sound from the stereo is great.  All the windows behind the driver are tinted dark enough to keep the contents of the trunk hard to see from the outside.  There are plenty of cup holders and map pockets - the only problems with the interior are that the glove compartment is too small (not even big enough to hold the manual Nissan gives you) and there isn't a little drawer or compartment for loose change.

The handling is responsive and car-like, and the 5-speed is far and away the easiest and smoothest manual transmission I've driven, car or truck.  The 4L gear is very strong in case you want to go off-road, and I would expect the 4H to be similarly strong though I haven't tried it myself.  The truck does admittedly get blown around quite a bit in high winds, and the rear leaf-spring suspension causes the back end to jump up a bit when you go over bumps.  But overall the Xterra doesn't feel topheavy enough to present an inordinate rollover risk.

My only major issues are with the engine, which is substantially underpowered (even the high-end V6), inefficient, and very messily laid out under the hood - a huge tangle of wires and hoses.  The bad gas mileage isn't a surprise, but it really should be better considering the truck's relatively modest size.  I especially notice the insufficient power when merging or passing on the highway, when I sometimes have to shift all the way down to third gear to muster enough acceleration.  Fortunately it's not much of a problem in city or suburban driving.  But overall, considering the sluggishness of even the V6, I <i>strongly</i> recommend against the 4-cylinder.

Despite the lackluster engine, the Xterra is solidly constructed and a great buy - a surprisingly genuine sport-utility vehicle in a back-to-the-basics sort of way.  It's a shame that most of the Xterras sold probably won't be used anywhere except the city, because cheesy as Nissan makes it sound, this model truly was made for use outdoors.  I'm looking forward to quite a few great years of dirt roads and dust on the back windshield.<br><br>
