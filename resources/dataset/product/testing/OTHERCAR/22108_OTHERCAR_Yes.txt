            I would like to sing my praises about this awesome little camera! It turns my computer
into my own &quot;dark room&quot; for &quot;instant developing of my pictures&quot;. I can instantly see the
picture I just took with the review option on the camera, so there are no more
disappointments when the pictures come back from the store. If for some reason I don't
like the picture, it is a quick little click to delete and start over, therefore always perfect
&quot;Kodak Moments&quot;.

Then the excitement comes when I upload the pictures onto my computer. The
possibilities are endless with each picture, I can size, trim, repair, change the file type for
web viewing or printing. It is like having my own photo album on my computer. No more
boxes full of pictures to &quot;someday&quot; organize. No more frantically looking for &quot;that
special picture&quot;. 

My camera has an adapter to save the batteries, it has rechargeable batteries for longer
life. I can take up to 28 photos with out deleting them off my camera. The freedom this
camera has given me is awesome.

Now Family and Friends ask, &quot;Did you bring the camera?&quot;, instead of &quot;Hi how are you?&quot;
when I come in. 

So often a moment happens that needs to be saved, and inevitably there is either no
camera or film. Now no more missing those precious moments.

Thankyou, Kodak !<br><br>
