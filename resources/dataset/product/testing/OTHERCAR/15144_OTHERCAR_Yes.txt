            I own a '96 Pontiac Grand Am SE Olympic Edition and am pretty pleased with the durability of the car.  But a few of my friends, along with myself have discovered that the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light appears after about 50,000 miles.  Also, the &quot;Check Oil&quot; light might appear after about 
70,000 miles.  The car has a very good factory sound system, roomy back seats, comfortable seats, and a nice sized trunk.  The gas mileage, with a 13-gallon tank, gets around 200-250 mpg in city, and get around 350 mpg on the highway.  The handling of the car is very fluid.  The first time a test drove the car, I was amazed by how smooth the car drove.  The type of
person who I would recommend to purchase the car is someone who like a sporty car, but yet the &quot;roominess&quot; of a small luxury car.  I like the car, and if I have no problems before I hit 100,000 miles (I now have 81,000), I'll keep it!!<br><br>
