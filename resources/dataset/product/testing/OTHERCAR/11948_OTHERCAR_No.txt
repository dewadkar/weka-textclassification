            The subject is the S10 chevy 4X4 truck to use 10on a mail route. I have had more troubles with this truck than any thing I have ever used. I bought the truck late in the evening,the next morning I noticed all the tires had bulge on the sidewalls so did other new S10&quot;s. I had to replace the tires at 12000 miles and the breaks at 14000. The next thing to go wrong was the fuel gauge which is connected to a $520 dollar fuel pump.Winter came it was snowing I pulled on the four wheel shifter and it came up thru the floor. The winter of 98-99 came,this could not happen again,it was snowing and again I pulled on the shifter it and the plastic chain came up thru the floor again. I could not believe the parts were held together by a plastic chain. In June of 2000 the $520 dollar fuel pump went bad,before the trouble was found I had to have the truck towed three times and three fuel pumps later the trouble was bad wiring,but I had paid for a fuel pump and labor. I am not the only person locally having trouble with model truck. Now for small things wrong,the gas pedal sticks,it leaks around the windows,the door on the drivers side drags,the seat broke down before 35000 miles,the plastic seat adjusters broke,it has a terrible AM-FM radio and the hollow mirror support fatigued and fell off. The 1997 Chevolet S10 4x4 in my 0pinion is poorly made,poorly engineered and dangerous at any speed.<br><br>
