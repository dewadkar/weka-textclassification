            I purchased a 1999 quest not long ago for my family.  I have to admit it was hard for us to give up the Pathfinder we so loved for the more family friendly vehicle.  My husband insists he looked much cooler in the Pathfinder.

But even though we bought it reluctantly we are sold on the idea now.  We have the TV/VCR option which so far has reduced the number of she's touching me, she's looking at me, her shadow is on my side fights that were driving us crazy.  

We have two children so there is even room for the dog to have her own seat although she still prefers my lap especially when I'm wearing dark clothing.  

It handles well, much like the Pathfinder with a smoother ride although I still haven't mastered backing up in tight spaces.  Sometimes I feel like I should have one of those beeps that the truck drivers use.

It's quite comfortable and has several nooks and crannies all around to hide our mess in.
