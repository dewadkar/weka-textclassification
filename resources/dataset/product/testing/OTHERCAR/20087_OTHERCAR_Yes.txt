            Bought mine for $3200 with 54k miles with automatic from a wholesale lot open to the public.  Car wasn't spiffed up by any means and the body has it's share of little dings and scratches.....but I could care less.  I put 4 new Yokohama Avid T4's on it, replaced the spark plugs and airfilter and this baby runs great! I've now got 62k on it and this is a great little car.  Feels bigger than it is and is composed on the highway and handles excellent.  Doesn't have much low end speed but I drive it 70-80 all day long on the highway and the car is as smooth as silk.

I had a 2000 Camaro Z28 boat that I just sold.  I enjoy driving this car more than I did that one.  It was fast as hell but handles like a bus and got about the same mpg as a bus.  Only thing the '95 Protege could use is a few more horses under the hood.  I'm averaging almost 30mpg and I drive pretty fast all the time.  If you're looking for a car that's very cheap to own, is very reliable, and is actually fun to drive........you can't go wrong with the Protege.
