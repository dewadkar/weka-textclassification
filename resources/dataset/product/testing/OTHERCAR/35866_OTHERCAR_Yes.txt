            My 1982 Volvo DL Wagon (Doris the Volvosaurus) is the most practical, reliable vehicle of the fifteen I've owned!  As I write this the odometer reads 221,988 miles.  I bought the car as a workhorse from it's original owner two years ago and have put 24,000 miles on it in that time.  Parts are available everywhere, as the 240 was made from 1976 until 1993 with few changes.  I read recently that there are still more than a million 82-93 240's on the road in the U.S. alone, so mechanics and support are easy to come by.  

As far as safety goes, in 1978 the 240 was named America's safest car by the Automobile Safety Institute and became their model for vehicle crash safety.  In fact, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON died in a Volvo 240 between 1978 and 1983 in the U.S.!  Volvo incorporated front and rear crumple zones, side impact beams, a drop-down engine design, and reinforced roofs in all 240 models.  These statistics are available online at vehicle safety websites - I'll add a link to some soon.  Another great source for "happy ending" Volvo accident stories is at http://langis.richard.tripod.com/accident.html  

Though slow, my wagon has paid for itself many times over in the course of helping people move or hitting garage sales on weekends.  I've put a couch, futon, hide-a-bed, bar, and other big, bulky items in the car with no problems.  The tailgate lifts high and the cargo area is long and wide (76 cubic feet of space!) when the rear seat is folded forward.  With a roofrack on top, I can transport bikes and skis while 5 people and all their gear fit inside.  I get the cargo room of an SUV without the poor mileage and danger to other drivers!

My repair history?  A timing belt at 105,000 and 190,000 miles, a fuel injection system replacement at 165,000 miles, and oil changed every 3,000 miles.  I change the belts and fluids by their periodic service intervals and have never been let down.  Reliability is legendary with the DL's 2.1 litre B21 engines, with several hundred thousand miles possible before a major rebuild is required.  Under the hood, everything is laid out where you can get to it.  A home mechanic could easily access the plugs, wires, belts, air filter, timing belt (it's on the outside of the engine), hoses, and oil filter with no difficulty.  It's not the fastest car out there but acceleration isn't as slow as you'd think.  I can still cruise at 75 mph with the car fully loaded down.  And the braking is quite good, as well, allowing easy control of the car even during panic stops.  I wouldn't hesitate to drive it across the country and back tomorrow if I had to - and I know the car would make it!  

Gas mileage is amazing for a big, 3,300 lb station wagon.  I average 35 mpg on the highway and about 28 in town,  about 400 miles on a full tank of gas.  (Since I first published this three people have e-mailed me to say they get far worse mileage and one person gets better mileage than this.  My car does have a few modifications that may result in better mpg, namely an aftermarket IPD front air dam, a fairing for the roofrack, 700 series alloy wheels, a K&N air filter, and SuperLube engine treatment that reduces friction.  A friend with an '89 240 DL wagon tells me she averages about 350 miles on a tank of gas) I've driven from Portland, Oregon to Vancouver, Canada without ever refilling!  My 4 speed w/overdrive manual transmission still shifts smooth and easily in all conditions despite never having been rebuilt or serviced.  All electric items are still working properly - amazing for a 21 year old car!  The seats are comfortable on long trips and offer a lot of leg room both front and rear.  Headroom is amazing, easily 5" above my head - and I'm 6'3" tall!  

Quality is excellent all around.  Factory Bosch engine components, though expensive when replaced, will last for years.  The rubber-covered bumpers can take a beating without showing it.  Even my paint is still shining like new and the interior vinyl is in great shape with the exception of the driver's seat, which has the usual wear tears.  The carpet shows no wear or fade, as do any of the plastic pieces.  The dashboard is sun cracked, something you'll see on all old 240's.  The long windows, thin roof pillars, and slotted headrest make it blind-spot free.  I have no air conditioning or power windows, though I hear those are trouble spots on 75-92 240's. 

My complaints about the car?  

1. No cruise control on long trips, though it was offered as a factory option.  

2. The stock radio height is far too low - down near the shifter where your eyes have to leave the road to adjust it.  I've had mine moved to the storage area near the dashboard, where Volvo moved it to after 1987.  You can get the kit online or from junkyards.  Plus when you're done, you get a much bigger storage area where your radio is now.

3. The brakes squeal pretty bad after they get hot, sometimes freaking out drivers in front of me.  I hear this on many older Volvos at stoplights so I think it's a common problem.

4. Hard to keep straight in the snow due to the rear-wheel-drive.  This could also be that I live in Portland, Oregon, where we're lucky to get snow more than one day a year and I'm bad at driving in it!  

5. No sunroof offered in the U.S. wagon models!  I had one installed and I love it, plus it looks great and doesn't interfere with the roof rack.

6. The fuel filter is located under the car near the gas tank and is a pain to replace each year.  Most cars have it under the hood where you can get to it easily.

7. A split-fold rear seat would have been nice, but Volvo didn't introduce those until the 7 series models.

8. When the rear seat is folded flat, the front seats have to be moved forward a few inches, compromising leg room.  It seems a rear seat positioned further back (like in a Subaru Legacy wagon) would have made more sense.  When I take long road trips I remove the bottom half of the seat and gain four or five inches of leg room.  This extra space also allows the cargo area to be turned into a pretty decent bed on camping trips!

And that's it!  Small gripes that are all petty!  I think I'll have this car forever...it's just too practical to give up!  I don't drive it every day, however, as it's pretty big and I feel guilty with over 90 cubic feet of empty space in my car as I'm going to work.  My daily driver is a tiny Geo Metro convertible that's great for hauling nothing but a friend and I at 54 miles per gallon.
