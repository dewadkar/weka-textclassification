            We bought our ISUZU trooper in 1995, new.  Although we have not had any dire problems, we have had some costly repairs.  The clutch and the transmission both went out, and were not cheap to fix.  We also had to have the windshield repaired twice, it seems to be prone to chipping.  The thing that is most inconvenient about the trooper, however, is the back seats. 

 Although spacious enough, the backseat makes a very uncomfortable ride, even for children.  The seat belts in the back are quite uncomfortable, every time you lean forward, it feels like a boa constrictor is tightening its grasp on you, you feel like you are going to be strangled to death.  If that weren't bad enough, you can feel every pebble on the road, making it a very unpleasant ride. 

I would not recommend the ISUZU trooper to anyone, it is not a good value for your money, the repairs are expensive and frequent, and it is not fun for passengers.<br><br>
