              I bought a Jeep in the summer of 1999. We needed a larger car, at the time I drove a 1992 Dodge Stealth,( that was the famly car ). We needed a change!!! This Jeep is a terrific car, the gas milage is a little on the steep side, but the computer system takes your attention away from everything, (even driving!) The front seats are some of the most comfortable leather things ever invented, but the back were like a board covered in cement. I drove this thing to Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, and made a wrong turn and found my self in Georgia. We were gone a week and a half in that car on this trip, it was me, my girlfriend, her son, my son, and my sister. 5 of us.But I still can't get over how stiff thoughs D#$% seats were, I felt like I got hit by a truck after sitting in them for 45 minutes! So needless to say I sat in the front the rest or the way. My Grand Cherokee has an inline 6cyc. engine and boy was it loud, I couldn't hardly sleep!
Then it began to pour rain, hail, and lots of wind (no sleeping there), I thought it was going to tip, but it held the road. I realy like my Jeep and I know I'm getting another when that one hits 150,000 miles.<br><br>
