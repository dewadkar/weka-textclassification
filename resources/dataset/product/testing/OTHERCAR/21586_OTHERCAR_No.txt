            I bought my 95 Intrepid ES in 1999 with 45,000 miles on it.  I took the car for several test-drives, checked everything, and was satisfied the car was worth the $9,995 price tag.  It now has 115,000 miles, and has caused more problems in two years than all the other cars I have owned � combined!  Because business requires me to travel, I always try to use dealerships for repairs because they should be the best qualified to work on my Dodge�

In my first Winter I found the car would flood and refuse to start in temps below 0.  A nearby Dodge dealer found that a recall correcting this malfunction had not been taken care of.  They reprogrammed the computer, patted me on the back, and sent me on my way.  When it happened again the next day, a second Dodge dealer worked on the car for 2 days and could not find anything wrong.  A third dealership near my home had the car for a week and could not find the problem.  I examined the car myself and found aftermarket �platinum� plugs installed, replaced them with stock plugs and have not had the problem since.

Soon thereafter the right tie rod failed while driving, launching the car to within inches of Lake Superior and damaging the front tires.  While replacing the broken tie rod, the local repair shop also replaced the left tie rod and found both lower ball joints worn, which can only be repaired by replacing the lower control arms.

In Summer 2001 the cooling system blew while driving on the highway.  A nearby Dodge dealer arranged for a tow and diagnosed the problem as a blown water pump.  Since they didn�t have a MOPAR pump in stock, they installed a rebuilt aftermarket pump.  Two days later it happened again, this time close to home, and the local Dodge dealership arranged for another tow.  They determined that the aftermarket pump was inadequate, replaced it with a MOPAR pump, and agreed to partially cover the repair.  I made it a mile before the car overheated again.  This time they diagnosed that the aftermarket pump had damaged the head gaskets, which now had to be replaced.  The two dealerships involved both blamed the other, and Dodge Corp. �regretfully� informed me that since each dealer is a separate enterprise, they were not able to help.

The aluminum wheels corrode and freeze to the hubs.  The right power door lock has stopped working.  The brakes must be replaced often, and the rotors warp quickly.  Windshield wiper blades wear out fast, and the washer nozzles plug and freeze easily.  I have replaced both front wheel bearings, both lower control arms, one CV joint (the other is coming due), and an A/C pressure switch.  I have repaired the radio twice.  Spark plugs must be replaced about twice a year, and DO NOT use anything other than stock!  I haven't found a Dodge/Chrysler dealer that I have been satisfied with.

I own two Pontiacs over 100,000 miles.  They always start, never leak, never squeak, require virtually no maintenance, and get better mileage than the Intrepid.
