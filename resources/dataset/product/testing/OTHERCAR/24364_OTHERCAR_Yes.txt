            The sony dsc is the best camera I have ever used,  It is just great.  My parents purchased the sony dsc about two and half weeks ago.  they told they got a new camera and I was like big deal just another stupid camera that I will struggle using, but this camera is different trust me.  This is one of the most easiest cameras to operate.  You could probably learn to operate this camera when your three years old.  This camera is really fun to use to, It has a thing on it called freeze frame.  You just push the btton and it freezes the picture, this can be really funny cause you can freeze people doing really silly things.  Also if you are person that tapes a lot of stuff like me, I am always taping my brothers football games, well with this camera it is really easy you don't have to worry about a thing you just move the camera towards the action and the camera does the rest.  Well I would definatly reccommend this camera to anyone it is well worth its price!!<br><br>
