            This is my first digital camera.

What sold me was the features. I liked the fact that the camera uses regular AA batteries, not a pricey proprietary battery like some cameras do. So in a pinch you can find batteries anywhere.

You can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride (DON'T use NiCads!) batteries and a charger inexpensively at Radio Shack. 

I also like the fact the camera uses Compact Flash memory cards. Again, widely available. This camera can use up to a 128 meg card.

Some cameras only have internal memory, which means when you fill up the memory, you can't take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and erase them from the camera's memory.

It also has a 3X optical zoom. A digital only zoom basically just crops the picture, so the resolution suffers. 

The camera also has a lot of settings that can be defined by the user. Flash, white balance, power settings, etc. It's got a lot of options....but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all.

It also comes with a USB cable so you can download the photos to your computer. And the Canon software is pretty decent. 

I thought that a 1.3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photos, but I was pleasantly surprised. At the highest resolution setting, this camera takes excellent, sharp pictures. A friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to 8x10, and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper.

The results were amazing.

I had always read that you couldn't enlarge pictures taken with a 1.3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6, and even that was stretching it.

Don't believe it!

The 8x10's he made were sharper than the 4x6 prints I usually get using 400 ASA film.

This camera will take pictures in near total darkness, but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grainy.

However, the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive. The results are crisp, clear, well exposed and have nicely saturated colors. 

The battery life is about average, and there is a fair amount of parallax error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the LCD. The LCD can be hard to see in bright light, also.

If you are looking for your first digital camera, you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these. It's loaded with features and won't cost an arm and a leg.

Canon has discontinued this model, and they can be had cheap, if you can find one.

I love this camera!
