            Nice little camera for the dollar!  Very easy to use (learned in a matter of seconds), clear shots, built in flash, and great software.

Pictures come out sharp and clear!  Instant picture gratification!!

Just two things. It's case is a little on the cheapy side (that grey plastic we all have been seeing lately) and no AC adaptor.  In a matter of fact you will not find the adaptor in the retail stores.  I looked all over (including small local electronics stores... I'm from Chicago) and because it requires 1.5 amps you won't find it.  It's proprietary (GOTCHA!).  When you call HP they will be happy to FedEx you one for $49.00 !!  

Wow... I nearly fell off my seat!  The HP rep. admitted to me that the great price point for the camera is because they did not include the adaptor.  So buy lots of batteries or a good recharging system.

All in all HP has a winner!  I have grown to trust their products and their name has a quality meaning and service.<br><br>
