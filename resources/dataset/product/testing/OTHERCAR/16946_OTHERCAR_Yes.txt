            I think the Subaru Outback is one of the most underrated cars on the market!  I recently traded my 1996 Outback in on the new 2000, and I have loved both cars.  Subaru makes a solid car.  I have had NO PROBLEMS at all with either car, and I drive them pretty hard.  I have not even had one of those annoying squeaks or rattles that most cars get!  I racked up 93,000 miles on my first car and never had any type of repair required other than routine maintenance.
I live in the Northeast, and the all wheel drive is an awesome feature for New England driving.  Not only does it make driving in the snow a piece of cake, but it also makes driving on a wet road like driving on a dry one!  The all wheel drive also improves handling for those twisty back roads.
Subaru also has lots of great safety features.  I already mentioned the all wheel drive (which you really have to experience to believe!), but the Outback also comes standard with ant-lock brakes, airbags and lots of collision protection built in.  My parents have an Outback as well, and got hit in the passenger side by a guy who ran a red light.  He was travelling really fast and mashed in the passenger side badly, but the inside was fine and neither of my parents got a scratch!  His car was totalled.  Their car still does not have a rattle or squeak after being repaired!  What a great car!!<br><br>
