            I have a '93 GS(5M). In 97, I also recommended my girlfriend to buy a Integra LS(4AT), she did. She loves this car so much. My sister is going to buy a new car, I also told her to buy a Integra 2000 GS, and she is going to buy it in next Jan. This car is so great, it only has 1.8 liter, but it produces 142 hp for my '93 GS, 140 '94 and up. I can beat almost every car at the similar level, even a Camaro(Top Speed). I've driven my '93 GS at 141 mph on a regular road! I swear to God that I really did. I'm going to graduate from college this coming May. After that, I will probably buy a new GS-R or a Type-R(if they still have in stock). 
It is an &quot;INTEGRA RULE!&quot;<br><br>
