            I purchased this car used. 4yrs old with a little more than 60,000 miles. I originally was looking for something affordable, roomy enough for kids and extra baggage with good gas mileage. I was impressed with how roomy it is for being a smaller car. The rear doors have child safety locks that prevent the doors from being opened from the inside when engaged, which is great with small children. A built in child seat also is a plus. Other things about the car that I like include; air conditioning, driver and passenger airbags, rear defrost and a good sized trunk.
Now on to the problems which is my main reason for writing this review. Shortly after I bought the car I noticed odd little "happenings". One day I had reverse lights, the next day I didn't. Then my lights were suddenly working again, but I had no defrost. After repeated visits to my mechanic and numerous electrical problems which were fixed one by one..I still have a few issues with dash lights going dim or off for no reason. The car had a faulty head gasket which caused a slow oil leak. My mechanic said he'd seen alot of these cars with this problem but no recall was ever issued. The automatic transmission failed after 80,000 miles. We decided that it would be too costly to get a new transmission on top of all the repairs to the car already so we set out to find a used one. We ended up with a transmission from a 1998 Neon (which will work just fine).
My last complaint is a cosmetic one. The paint peels. It started with a little "bubble" on the roof and one on the driver side door. The paint has since peeled and chipped off of the roof, hood, front and rear drivers side doors and trunk. Car washes are almost completely out of the question...unless you want to see the paint wash away with the water spray. On the upside, I've managed to make new friends. ;) Seems those of us with Neons have a "bond" with one another. When we see each other in parking lots we tend to discuss our mutual problems and solutions.
