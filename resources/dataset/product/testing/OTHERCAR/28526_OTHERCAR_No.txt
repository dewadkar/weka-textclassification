            You know my brother-in-law - or someone like him.  He's the guy that will use a huge golf umbrella on crowded city streets.  He's the guy who smoked cigars for the 3 year period when it was fashionable, and not a day after.  He's the guy that plays golf even though he's not good at it and doesn't enjoy it, because that's what the big shots do.  He's the guy that lives in New York City and bought an H2, even though he couldn't really afford it.

All that being said, I like the guy.  We recently drove up to Boston on business in his spanking new H2, and I have come to the conclusion that this vehicle is meant to be seen, not driven.  Let me work from the outside in.

Well, it's big.  Yup.  Those now-lame Navigator owners will shrivel with envy, their feelings of superiority gone flaccid as you drive by them.  The H2 may be more expensive than certain enhancement surgeries, but a lot less risky.  Unless you count the rollover factor, in which case it's more risky.  Oh well.  A few words about the design of the H2:  It's a box.  With wheels.  The front has a big bulbous chrome attachment to spice things up a little, and I notice that a lot of H2's are painted school bus yellow in order to divert attention from the basically uninspired design.  To his credit, my B.I.L. at least went with a relatively staid maroon color.  The typical crap that's pasted to SUV's these days is all there - various cow pushers, headlight guards and undersheilding all complete the fantasy that you might some day, some way drive off road.  Fit and finish is acceptable.

As a passenger, you'd best hope that you're in for a short ride.  Despite the overall "bigness" of the vehicle, the passenger compartment is, well, small.  My Altima is roomier, to say nothing of my 1971 Sport Fury.  After a couple hours, the ride became torture, and it wasn't much helped by the high noise and vibration levels in the passenger compartment.  Behind the wheel, however, matters are worse.  This baby handles like a cross between a 747 and a sponge, and despite the HEAVY fuel consumption, it feels strangely gutless.  I didn't take the H2 off road, so I can't comment about it's performance there, but don't worry - 99.1% of the people that purchase these things won't be doing any 4 wheelin' either.

Hey!  Here's something neat!  The dashboard and instrument panel are truly cool and well designed, sporting big guages and nice metal accents.  A pleasure to look at.

I can't comment on reliability, and I doubt many H2 owners can.  The car simply hasn't been out long enough to know how well it will hold up over the long term, but I have read that initial complaint levels are not encouraging.  That being said, the thing didn't break down on us.

So, what do we have here?  I'm going to go out on a limb and call this the Edsel of Sport Utility Vehicles.  I think SUV's finally reached the point where an auto maker decided take all the styling cues of an era, make them a little bigger and a little louder (make that a lot), throw them all into one dream car to end all other cars of the type, and wait for the green to roll in.  But maybe, just maybe, as with the Edsel, people will look at this car and say, "What the HELL have we been thinking?  This is a monstrosity!"

Then again, maybe not.
