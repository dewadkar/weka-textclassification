            The Honda Accord is one of the best compact cars out there. The styling is beautiful along with the interior of the car. The only complaint that Accord owners have is that they could use a little more power.

First and foremost, the owners with the VTEC engine will see the greatest benefits from following these words of advice. This is not to say that non-VTEC owners should stop reading, in fact I have a non-VTEC myself.

In making your Accord perform there are many companies out there willing to help you. (i.e. sell you their produce)

The first thing to do is exchange that restrictive air intake box under the hood for a open-air element, such as a K&amp;N or Foam air filter. This will be a cylinder element connected to a tube that connects to the intake manifold. There are many intakes out there, and if you live in a very very dry place, then I recommend getting a cold-air intake, as this sends better performing cold air into the engine. This will cost anywhere from $100-$250

Headers on an Accord make little difference, and the stock exhaust manifold is fine, unless you are making some major modifications to your engine. 

You exhaust on your Accord is the most restrictive part of your engine design. As one should know, restriction is bad. The stock exhaust is manufactured to be extremely quiet. If you can afford to sacrifice a little noise, then putting a larger free-flow exhaust on your Accord is a must. I recommend a cat-back system with at most a 3-inch diameter pipe. If you want to keep your car quiet, then speak with your local performance shop about this necessity before you put on your new exhaust. This will cost anywhere from $150-$600 depending on materials used in your piping and exhaust. 

The Accord has a great engine, just demanding to be explored and pushed. Enjoy your Accord.
