            I purchased my 98 Kia Sephia in February of 1998. The date of manufacture was Dec 1997. I drive about 36K per year and now have 145K on it, and it&#146s still not paid for yet. After reading a lot of reviews I felt it was time to add my two cents worth. I do all my own repairs to save money, except for the recalls and warranty items. First, I did have problems with adding fuel. If you tried to add it to fast it would shut off the nozzle to early so I relaxed and added fuel real slow and it almost would go to full each time. This was fixed with the recalled in-tank valve. The other recalls for the wipers and fuel pump wiring were also completed, but I didn&#146t experience problems with them any way. Now for the brakes, the dealer did replace my rotors early because they were warped, explanation was the two assembly line hold down screws didn&#146t allow them to expand evenly. This did make sense, and they replace the rotors and removed the screws. A word of caution, I never let anyone remove or mount wheels to my vehicles. The reason is they over tighten the lug nuts and this usually warps brake drums and rotors, I always use a torque wrench. The paint is thin and chips easy also the body panel thickness could have been better but this is why I get 36 highway from the weight savings. The car seemed to shake about 60mph, this was a mix of bad tires and the fact that the wheels aren&#146t true but try to get the dealer to believe this. With a good set of tires I have Michelin X ones I don&#146t notice the shaking any more.
My first scheduled major repair was the timing belt @ 70k, It took about 2 � hours out side on a chilly Saturday in February. The manual say&#146s 60k but if you live in California it&#146s 100K, like they put in a special belt just for California, NOT! Dealer wanted $500 to do this the belt was a $100. I did have some problems with my AC, the bearing in the compressor pulley froze. The dealer wanted $550 for the whole electromagnetic clutch assembly because they didn&#146t list the bearing as a separate part. So I pressed out the bearing and went to the Thomas register online and found a NSK bearing dealer that matched the number and they shipped it to a local distributor cost $22. Also a steel spike came up from the road and punctured my condenser, bought used online for $150. One setback was I did break a hose on the compressor while working on the pulley $90. With the two recharges because of the leak it cost about $500 total to fix, dealer cost would have been  $1500+. There were little things, I did have the glove box latch problems. The latch pin worked loose, unscrewed the latch and reseated. The door locks do tend to freeze so I leave the car unlocked so I can get in and warm it up. After that it was quite up till 135K, that&#146s when all the struts went bad, couldn&#146t get aftermarket parts so had to buy dealer ouch, about $550 total, saved a bundle on labor. At 142K the rear brake drum cylinders froze, It was Sunday so I figured I would just look for cylinders for cars that Kia made for Mazda or Ford. Finally found a good match with 91 Mazda Prot�g�. The Kia cylinders were flush mounted and the Mazda&#146s used a gasket so I just used silicon sealer to make one. The other problem was Kia uses a European style brake fitting so I had to modify it for the typical US flange style, total $35 including the flange tool. The driver side emergency break cable froze, it uses a plastic coated cable and it wore a hole in the jacket and the rust swelled it tight. Just pealed back the jacket and cleaned out the rust. At 144K I could hear a thunking sound just about when I stopped, this turned out to be the inner universal joint connected to the jackshaft on the passenger side. If you think yours is bad just rock the cup it should only move a little, mine moved about 45 deg. Bought the whole right side axle with the jackshaft for $75 also got the left for $75 from a local auto recycler for axles with only 2k on it. Boot was ripped so had to recycle my old one. Dealer wanted $440 just for the axle no jackshaft. Also found that annoying rattle in the dash, this had bugged me for a long time. When I pulled out my dash it turned out to be how they mount the top lip near the windshield. There are three pins that insert into three plastic cups. The cups are just snapped into the holes, the noise was the cups rattling so I smeared them with silicone sealer. My radio freaks out, the buttons change what there supposed to do, like if you want to turn it off the off button now cranks the volume up, I&#146m still working on this one. I have to say that this is the easiest car to work on except for the oil filter placement. The major plus is the fact that the motor is still going strong, that&#146s because it&#146s made by Mazda.Fixing the radio is relatively easy if you&#146re handy with a soldering iron, lot&#146s of cold joints. I installed my own remote starter, $39.99, I designed a safety interlock so if it&#146s in gear or moved out of neutral the car won&#146t run. Put in my third timing belt @ 156k, welded some cracks in the resonator @ 160k, Rep. alternator @ 170k, Rep rear parking break cables @ 173k. Up to 174k now and just made my last payment. Now have 206,000.
