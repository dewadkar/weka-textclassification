            Just a warning to other 2000 Odyssey owners.  Our van is 3-months old.  A few weeks ago, my wife went to the gas station to fill-up.  While unscrewing the gas cap, the escaping pressurized gas fumes burst into flames.  Luckily, only the hair on her arm &amp; face were scorched.  The station attendant got an extinguisher &amp; put out the fire.  The Fire Marshall filed a report &amp; the van got towed to the nearest Honda dealer.  Honda's remedy was to replace the gas cap &amp; buff out the burn marks.  They cited &quot;static electricity&quot; as the cause &amp; claimed they had no responsibility for what happened.  Of course, they couldn't explain 1) how a plastic gas cap could create a static shock, 2) why the shock didn't occur when the cap was initially touched instead of occurring after the cap was partially unscrewed, 3) how she could have retained any static electricity after touching the door &amp; body of the van before she ever got to the gas cap.  The dealership manager told me that this happens for every million vans sold (how comforting that they think this is an acceptable casualty rate for the general public).  Since my wife &amp; children are all deathly afraid of the van, it sits in front of our house collecting dust.  Honda refuses to replace the thing, so we have engaged the Better Business Bureau to assist us in a settlement.<br><br>
