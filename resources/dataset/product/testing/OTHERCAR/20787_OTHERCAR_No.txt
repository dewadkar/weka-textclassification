            After looking at my 93 Blazer in 1997, I fell in love. Only for a short time though. Mostly the blazer has been faithful, except for many repairs. I like the handling and the interior (especially the digital dash), but it has been a bit of a high maintenance vehicle. Shortly after purchasing I had to replace the intake manifold gasket. The engine has otherwise performed flawlessly.

Many other minor problems have persisted however such as a broken rear hatch lock mechanism, water pump, drive belt and idler pulley, air conditioning, battery, shocks (all four), front brakes (twice), abs light, blown remote oil filter mount gasket, blown transmission front seal, u-joints, all front ball joints, complete exhaust system, and several small interior failures as well. The worst repair I had to under take was having the transmission rebuilt twice, and having rust on both front doors.

I think Chevrolet has let us down on this model, and hopefully will improve the quality they put into the smaller vehicles. I wouldn't have mentioned so many items, some are regular maintenance (maybe), but I did expect more.<br><br>
