            Last spring my wife I needed a car. My junker blew up and we were in a hurry. We couldn't afford a new car,
so went looking for a good used car. Our Concord sat in the front row of the used lot and my wife said,
&quot;Wow, look at that one!&quot; A five mile test drive and we were sold. Handled great, plenty of room for our three growing children. Safety galore, comfort beyond anything we have experienced and a full sized spare tire. Style is
important and this car says look at me. We didn't expect great gas mileage but 26 mpg in town and 31 mpg
on the only real trip we've taken. Not to bad for this very strong 3.2L engine by Chrysler. A great family car. You feel safe inside because it's not a compact. Leg room front and back even if you're 6'6&quot;. A  huge trunk. Easy to reach controls from the driver seat and a stock stereo that sounds as good as any stock stereo I've ever heard,
not to mention very easy to program. I'll look for another one to buy! Everyone should a least test drive a
Chrysler concord. Oh yeah, one down side it won't fir in a compact car parking space. Oh well, I guess I'll
walk the extra 100' to the store.
