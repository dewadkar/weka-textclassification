            I bought my Pathfinder a couple of months ago and I absolutely love it.  I used to own a car and after being in the Pathfinder, being able to see better is great.  I love the four doors.  My kids are able to get in and out without me having to lift the seat forward or sliding it forward, they just open the door and get in or out.  It's great.  I bought it used and it's only had one other owner and only paid about $10,000 for it.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys nice drives to purchase a Pathfinder and enjoy the ride.  Or if you have kids or animals that you take places.  It has so much room.  I can pack a lot of stuff in my Pathfinder.  It has a lot of room.  And the gas mileage is good too.  I am paying the same in gas as I was in my little car.  It gets real good gas mileage.  I tell you, I haven't found anything wrong with my Pathfinder and I don't expect to.  It's everything I expected and more.<br><br>
