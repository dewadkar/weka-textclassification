            I had a Camry for 7 years. Was happy with it. So, another Toyota was a natural decision...
The Avalon 2000 *looked* good (look is deceiving), but, from the start:
1. When closing the rear door a little too hard, a plastic cover just falls off! Was fixed, but this is not a good sign (don't they test the doors in the factory?)
2. Rattles, rattles, rattles... The adjustable seat belt attachments rattle when the road is a little rough (everywhere in California). The attachments were replaced, but the rattles are still there. This is a design flaw or a cheap seat belt. The dash board had some maddening noises that kind of went away (for now)...
3. Car pulls to the left. All the time. Everywhere. The Toyota dealer said the alignment is 'within tolerance' and suggested that the roads are not truly flat... Sigh...
4. Rough transmission. When going from 1st to 2nd gear, depending on road conditions, you feel a shudder in best cases or a jolt in most cases. With a little practice, you can control the throttle to make the car shift at the ideal RPM (2600 to 2800 RPM are smoother). But I thought this was an *automatic* transmission... Dealer refused to acknowledge the problem, saying that, even if there is one, all this stuff is controlled by a computer and he cannot do anything about it. And I thought humans were smarter than computers...
5. Loud click when doing the following: go reverse, brake. Go forward, brake. What we all do every morning when pulling out of the driveway. The dealer said 'yeah, this is caused by the brake pads shifting, all cars do that'. No Sir, they don't.

I complained to Toyota. The customer service guys and gals are polite, but  they don't care. The dealers are (sometime) polite, but they obviously don't want to deal with problems.

All in all, this will be the last Toyota I will ever buy. It is not *that* bad, but not worth the money. If you plan to spend around $30K, I would advise to put the Avalon 2000 near the bottom of the list.<br><br>
