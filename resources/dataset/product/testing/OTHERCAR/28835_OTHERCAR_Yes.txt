            I purchased my Kodak DC-210+ digital camera approximately 1 year ago.  I looked into the facts of many digital cameras in the price range that I wanted to spend.  I decided on the DC-210+ because of price, pixels, accessories &amp; CompactFlash storage. I am really impressed with this camera and have no regrets about my decision to purchase it.  When I took my first photo and printed it on my HP Deskjet 722C I was so impressed.  I couldn't believe the quality that I got from the camera.

All of the accessories work well with the camera. The software installed properly and works very well for my needs.  Photo's download via serial port very well, but is slow.

I did have a PCMCIA card reader installed in my computer.  I put the CompactFlash card in the adapter and the photos are there instantly to view. Much quicker!<br><br>
