            I bought this little truck new in 1995.  I was driving a 1994 Dodge Dakota extended cab that I bought new in Dec. 1993 and was thoroughly dissatisfied with this very unreliable truck.  I had traded in a 1989 Nissan pickup on the Dodge was really regretting it.  I decided to get rid of the Dodge headache and started shopping for a new truck.  I looked at the S-10 and Ranger, wanting to stay in an American-made vehicle, but these 4-cyl. trucks did not have any power.  The Toyota was better but higher-priced.  The seat was a little low, though.  I went straight back to Nissan.  They have good power for a 4-cyl. and comparable interior room in the regular cab.  I had such good service from the 89 Nissan that I knew the Nissan would be more reliable.  My dad bought a 1986-1/2  Nissan truck new and has had several other Nissan trucks since then.  My mom is on her 3rd Altima.  

I found a dealer that sold both Nissan and Dodge (only a Dodge dealer would give me a decent trade-in; no one else wanted the Dakota, even though it only had 18,000 miles).  I walked in to the dealership and pointed out the little white Nissan on the lot.  I walked out with the keys and the title.

I put 90,000 miles on the truck and the only thing that ever went wrong on it was the speedometer quit working right before I sold it.  I bought a new speed sensor and gave it to the new owner when I sold it.  I kept the oil changed every 3,000 miles and rotated the tires every other oil change.  The original tires lasted 50,000 miles.  The second set were Michelins and they still looked new when I sold it.  They also improved the traction and handling.  This truck was 2WD but would go in any kind of weather.  I drove this truck on everything from interstates to tobacco fields and only got stuck once (in a big deep mudhole that high-centered the truck).  I put brakes on it one time.  Nothing else needed replaced while I owned it although the clutch was getting close.

I got decent mileage on the truck (23-25 mpg) and was satisfied with the ride quality.  It was a little cramped on long trips (I'm 6'1", 240 lbs) but not unbearable.  It would be nearly impossible for 3 adults to ride in this truck except for very short trips.  I would have been more satisfied with an extended cab.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  It never went to the service department so I can't comment on that.  Being a volunteer firefighter, this truck made more than a few high-speed runs on a curvy road.  I was very pleased with the handling although I wouldn't classify it as a sports car.  The second set of brakes faded easily, but they were cheap brakes.  I learned a good lesson there.  Don't skimp on brakes, you get what you pay for.   

I sold the truck to a friend and see it everyday.  I was in a car-pool and needed a car when another person joined.  I regret ever selling the truck and intend to buy another one in the future.  In my experience with nearly every major make of vehicle, nothing else compares with the reliablity of Nissan and Toyota trucks.  You will not go wrong buying one of these trucks, but the bigger person should consider an extended cab.
