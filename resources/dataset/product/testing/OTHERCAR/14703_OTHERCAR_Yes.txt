            I bought the 1999 forester because I was pregnant and wanted a safe, reliable vehicle with all-wheel-drive.

Forester was rated #1 in the Sports Utility Vehicle category and it ranked extremely high in crash tests.  I wanted a large enough vehicle that I could put our baby, dog and all our luggage in and still be comfortable on road trips.  The Forester provided this for us without the feeling that I was driving a monster truck.

I love being able to start my Forester on a hill after a heavy rain and know that the tires will never slip.  I love driving over the mountains in a snow storm and not having to put on chains.  I love the tight steering and the fast stoppage time.  I love that I'm driving an SUV yet I can park in small parking spots and don't need a step stool to get into my vehicle.

If you are looking for the feeling of a big truck, to tower over other cars and be &quot;king-of-the-road&quot;  the Forester is not for you.  If you want a reliable, non gas-guzzling, quick, tight, roomy, safe vehicle then look no further.  You have found your dream.
