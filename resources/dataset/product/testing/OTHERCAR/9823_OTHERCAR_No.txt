            I bought my Camaro used-$16,000 with 38,000 mi. It is a 30th anniversary edition Camaro RS Convertible, fully loaded. This car is quick and definitely turns heads whether the top is up or down. Great sound system (factory!). I can honestly say that I have not had any major mechanical problems in the two+ years I have owned it, just minor things such as spark plugs and an ABS problem covered under the extended warranty. 
   So why am I writing this? Well, maybe it is because I drove an SUV prior to my Camaro. Whatever the reason, here are my complaints. THE ROOF LEAKS! It leaks all over the drivers seat and I have ended up wet on numerous occasions! I even took the car in and paid $400 to have the doors and windows tightened, however this did not fix the problem. I was told that I could pay for new molding to be installed (est. $500)but that was no guaranteed fix. Did I mention that the top broke? A structural problem; two bolts popped out. It cost me about $300 to fix. The worst part was that it broke in the beginning of July and I was living at the beach for the summer. On a second note, beware of black leather seats; you end up getting burnt in the summer and the inside of the car heats to uncomfortable temperatures when the top is down.
   Driving a Camaro is similar to driving a go-kart. You are very low to the ground and are almost laying down in the car. The dashboard is so long that you cannot see the front of the car. The front of the car is very long, and it takes a while to become accustomed to parking and close turns. Any low bump at almost any speed will cause you to scrape the bottom of the car. Now that is an awful sound!
   Although I can say it has been fun driving a convertible sportscar, a Camaro in particular, I can honestly say that I am ready for a different car. I do not feel safe in this car, I am scared to drive it in the rain or snow, and I hate being so low to the ground. This car is strictly for looks and speed, however, I have had teenage racing enthusiasts blow me away with "souped up" Honda Civics.
