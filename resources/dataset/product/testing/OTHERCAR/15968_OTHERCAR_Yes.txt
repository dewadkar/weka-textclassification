            The 1998 E-class mercedes-benz is unique with its oval headlamps and new body style, being the mid-size sedan of all Mercedes. Has duel airbags and side airbags, bringing you home in one peice. The Mercedes E-class has 3 different models with different engines and features. The E300 has a 3.0 liter deisel engine. The E320 has a 3.2 liter v-6 engine, and the E430 has the 4.3 liter v-8 engine. All models have extremely comfortable seats in the front and the rear. The E-class has great brakes and a unique feature that allows you to turn off the passanger side airbag. I pesonally love this class but not as much as the SL-class. This is an extremely unique car that deserves a test drive.<br><br>
