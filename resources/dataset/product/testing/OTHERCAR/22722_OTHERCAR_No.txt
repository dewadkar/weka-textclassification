            I purchased this automobile on my lunch hour right off the showroom floor.  I now realize impulse buying is a big mistake.  

My 1995 Plymouth Neon Sport Coupe looked sharp on the showroom floor, but 3 years later it has been nothing but problems.  First, the head gasket went.  Come to find out Chrysler knows of the &quot;cheap&quot; plastic part, but did not issue a recall. Next came the paint job.  The roof of the car is blistering and peeling.  Of course, I have not had any success with this &quot;defect&quot; either.  The car has been on a recall three times for various other defects.  

My advice:  Do not buy a brand new car just being introduced for the first time.  You will only have headaches and go broke repairing.<br><br>
