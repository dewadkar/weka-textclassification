            I purchased my 1998 4-Runner for the same reason that the majority of people do - Toyota's reputation.  

Solid, dependable, and a feeling of safety when driving the vehicle are the main aspects that I truly enjoy about the 4-Runner.  However, with the feeling of being solid comes a sometimes abusive ride.  Abusive might be a strong word to use, but every single ripple in the road is felt while driving.  I have found that if you engage the ECT control, which makes the transmission shift faster and accelerate faster, the ride is more forgiving. Getting in and out of the vehicle is no easy task if you are not of at least 5'7.  My wife is 5'2 and she uses the running board and the interior pull-up handgrip every time she gets in or out of the vehicle. The interior is immaculate - with the Limited edition I purchased, you get all the bells and whistles.  It comes standard with a CD-player(that has not skipped once even with the rough ride), power leather seats with adjustable lumbar support, sunroof, etc.  

The 4-Runner is not for everyone.  Like I said previously, I purchased the 4-Runner for it's safety and reputation.  Those reasons far outweigh the &quot;stiff&quot; ride. I enjoy my 4-Runner and intend on keeping it for many years.  

I would not recommend this vehicle for anyone that has any physical limitations or the elderly, due to the height of the vehicle and the difficulties getting in and out of the vehicle. <br><br>
