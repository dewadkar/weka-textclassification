            Although this is one of the fastest cars I have ever driven, it is not the most fun. The inside of this car is so small that my head was bent to this side. In case you wanted to know, I bought this car about four weeks ago, but quickly realized my mistake when I drove it for a little while. In fact, I ended up giving it to my daughter as a graduation present, and now am driving her Volvo. The Mitsubishi is not for a big person. I am 6'2 and 180 pounds and it was one of the most uncomfortable cars I have ever been in. I am kicking myself for buying it. I guess I was overcome by the look and speed of the vehicle, that I overlooked the most important feature, my comfort.
And to top it all off Mitsubishi is not the greatest car company in the world. They do break down after the fist 100,000 miles so be careful! And you better be careful in this car, if you get into a high speed accident, it won't be good:)
