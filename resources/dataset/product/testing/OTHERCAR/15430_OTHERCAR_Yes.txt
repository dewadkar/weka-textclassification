            My best friend bought this car about a year ago. I got to drive it many times and it is a blast every single time. For a relatively small car, it has a lot of room inside, is very quiet and gives you a comfortable ride. On the freeway, it gets up to 45 miles to the gallon.
He bought this vehicle because he mainly wanted a reliable car. So far, he has had no trouble at all.
The steering is very direct and the engine strongly and smoothly accelerates with a sporty sound at higher rpm's.
The main drawback are the costs of parts once something has to be replaced.
If you want an economical car and it fits in your budget, get a VW GTI. If you are concerned about safety, get something bigger for the same price.<br><br>
