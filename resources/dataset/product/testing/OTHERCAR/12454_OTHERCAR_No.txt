            I've owned Volvos for years, and love the safety and reliability of the car, so that's where I headed first when I needed to re-up.  I bought the S40 about 10 weeks ago after spending the morning at a local dealer and making one extensive test-drive.  In retrospect, I should have driven it several more times under varying conditions. I'm moderately satisfied with it:  not enthusiastic, not negative.

On the plus side, the car does accelerate very well (a little turbo lag - not bad) and is extremely attractive, particularly in the brick red I bought.  The back seat is comfortable for 2 adults on short to medium drives - I wouldn't want to be back there cross- country.  The advertised mpgs seem to be holding up, although it's not exactly a penny-pincher.  Interior fittings - like the cup-holder - are for the most part well thought out.

The negatives:  first, the automatic transmission.  Part of it is me.  I'm a long time standard transmission driver, and the shift back to auto is quite a reality-check.  The road feel just isn't the same.  I should have waited for the standard model.

The steering is too mushy and over-responsive, and I noticed a bit of drift.  It's not tight and controlled, as you might expect from a European sedan.  As someone else noted in Consumer Reports, it's as if Ford's ownership interest in Volvo resulted in an Americanization of the car.  Ok if you like that kind of thing.  I don't, and didn't notice it in my too brief test drive.

The front seat area feels cramped.  This is aggravated by the location of the arm-rest, which sits over part of the window and lock control panel.  This means you either drive with the rest upright,or have to contort your hand into an awkward position to control windows when the rest is down.

The ride is a bit wash-boardy.  If you drive New England roads in the Spring, before the frost heaves have been smoothed over, you may need a kidney belt.

By no means is this a bad car.  I'd just suggest spending some time with it before you buy to make sure it's what you want.  If you simply assume it will handle and feel like other European cars (or even other Volvos), you'll be surprised.<br><br>
