            When General Motors released this body style back in 1973, who knew it would stand the test of time.  Although the design of the Suburban has remained relatively the same from 1973 to 1991, there have been many refinements. General Motors introduced the last revamped &quot;Square&quot; design of the Suburban in 1989.  Small changes were made to the interior, trim packages, and front grill, but the core of Chevrolet's Suburban remained the same; a 5.7L, 350 cubic inch powerhouse mated to a drive-line that rivals any bus. 

My Story:
Once the 1989 model was released, I was intrigued. This particular Chevrolet design was not only square and rugged looking, but also had a sleek sexiness about it. The 1991 model introduced slick black pod style mirrors, and completed the package nicely. I wanted one of these majestic road warriors for myself, but at the time, the sticker shock was a little too much for me to bare. 

I spent a good part of a year looking for the right combination of features, color scheme and prior upkeep.  Once I finally found the right match, I was in heaven.  What more could someone ask for?  I had a good looking, solid riding, haul anything I could imagine, pick up 7 of my closest friends kind of truck.

My 1991 Chevrolet Suburban is absolutely awesome! I can't think of a more versatile vehicle. Sure, there are other SUV's on the market that will give the 1991 Chevrolet a run for it's money, but the only truck that comes close to matching the size and power of the 1991 vintage Chevrolet is a Ford Excursion.  The last time I priced an Excursion out, I was looking at a sticker price of around $42,000. Now, when you compare this to the $8,800 I paid for my vehicle, you soon can imagine what you could do with the extra $33,000 in change that I saved. Don't get me wrong; The newer Suburbans are nice, but the increased price, and the slight reduction in size sway me to the older model. 

Drawbacks
There are a few drawbacks for owning a Suburban that is almost 10 years old.  There are a few more squeaks and chassis noises than when it was brand new.  Parts are a little harder to find at a moment's notice, and there always seems to be something little that needs to be tweaked or fixed as the car ages. Overall though, I have had no major problems, and the truck runs like a prize fighter battling it out in Round 3. 

Fuel Economy
The fuel economy on this vehicle is a little discouraging.  When you figure that you are spending enough in gas in a week to fuel a small country, your wallet tends to suffer a bit.  On average, I spend about $50.00 a week in fuel.  I can drive about 300 miles on a full tank, and get almost 10 miles to the gallon. This is definitely not a truck you would want to use as a commute vehicle daily.  

Cargo Room and Storage
Cargo room is a huge plus on this truck.  With the rear seat pulled out, and the 2nd row seats folded up, one could &quot;almost&quot; land a 747 in the cargo bay.  The storage/cargo room is incredible.  And with the various configuration of seats on this truck, almost any situation can be handled with the greatest of ease. 

Ride and Comfort:
The 1991 Chevrolet Suburban rides well considering it is a 4WD monster.  When sitting behind the wheel, you almost forget your are piloting a tour bus.  The steering is effortless, and the ride comfortable. There is something to be said about ride handling over sharp jarring bumps (Such as a railroad crossing). The chassis can sometimes be a little stiff, but I am thinking this is because of the &quot;stiffness&quot; of the Four Wheel Drive suspension. Beware of parking lots!  Although the Suburban is a joy to drive, it can be a bear to park.  I often find myself looking for an easy in/easy out parking spot so that I can avoid a 63 point positioning act. 

Who should buy this vehicle?
It would be easy for me to say that everyone should have one of these vehicles, but the truth of the matter is that unless you need this much space and versatility, you would probably be better off looking at a smaller vehicle.  The 1991 Chevrolet Suburban is a wonderful vehicle.  It looks great, rides well, can handle just about anything, can tow just about anything, and is fun to drive.  The drawbacks are that it requires a second job to pay for gas, is a little tricky when parking, and in general is a very heavy vehicle.  I can say this: I feel safe when driving this truck. Chances are that if I get into an accident with this truck, I will most probably walk away with minor injuries due to the size of the truck.
