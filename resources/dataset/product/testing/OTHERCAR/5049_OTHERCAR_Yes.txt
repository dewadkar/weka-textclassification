            I have to say this is an awesome car. I have a pearl white with tan leather seats and tan cloth roof, and she is quite a looker. I never thought I would enjoy a convertible so much, but I do, and I dont think I could ever go back to a sunroof. Its such a wonderful feeling of fun in the sun, and the safety I have come to expect from Mitsubishi. I like the fact that the rear seats sit very deep as I have two children, and their heads come no where near the top of the seat. My head doesnt even reach the top of the backseat. That was a big determining factor for me when I purchased this car, that in case it ever flipped their heads wouldnt touch the ground. Full shoulder seatbeats for all 4 seats. Great stereo system with side tweeters on the doors near the mirrows make for great clarity when the top is down. Large trunk area will fit a large size cooler, or a good size peice of luggage. Plenty of leg room in the back for the kids but not an adult. I only have a few cons regarding my car. My car has less than 20,000 miles and the roof has began leaking, had it repaired at the dealership several times, but have yet to get it to where it no longer leaks. I have since had to purchase a car cover, which has gotten to be a huge pain. I also have a metal gas tank cover instead of the cheap black plastic one, and it had began to rust after only 6 months, the dealership replaced it for free, and the second one is doing much better. The doors seem to come out of align easily and I have had those adjusted on about 8 ocassions. It only takes them 10 minutes to adjust, but it just an inconvinence.

Other than those few problems, I love my car!!!
