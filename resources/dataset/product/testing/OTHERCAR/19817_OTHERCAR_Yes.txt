            If you are the type of person who picks a car because it attracts attention, and you can't afford a Ferrari,  the Mercury Cougar is for you!  I was looking for a car in the $20,000 price range
and test drove several.  When I got in the Cougar, I fell in love!  It handles beautifully, looks great
and has everything I wanted in a car.  It comes standard with a lot of things most people want
so if you are looking for a stripped down car, you don't want this one.  On the &quot;too many gadgets&quot;
side of things, it tells me how many miles I have before I run out of gas, what the outside temperature is,
my average speed, and it even calculates my gas mileage for me.  I have had the car for 6 months,
and at least once a week, someone come up to me and tell me what a cool car I have.
The teenagers who work for me like it, and so do my co-workers.  My parents only have one complaint, it is 
difficult for them to get out of.  The other thing I noticed as I was driving my nephews, the back seats
sit so low, they couldn't see out the windows, which is important to a 6 year old.  The Cougar
comes only in a two door, so if you have children in a carseat, it is not too practical.  For those of us without children,
or those with older kids, the car gets good gas mileage, is styled beautifully, has lots of comfort features, and 
attracts a lot of attention.  <br><br>
