            The last few months I have been reading every review of medium priced digital camera's I could put my hands on and every time I thought I had found my camera there was something that prevented me from buying it: too small a zoom, too low a resolution etc. But I never considered Casio, after all who thinks of Casio as a camera manufacturer? Then I happened to read a review of the Casio QV-2800 UX and I knew I had found my camera at last. With a 8x optical zoom (equivalent to 40 to 320 mm), 1600 x 1200 or 800 x 600 pixel image size, 40 different automatic programs (maybe a bit too much, for who is going to use them all?), but also the possibility of manual control it leaves every photographer with enough freedom to make any picture the way he wants to.
The results are great!
Power consumption is something else. Especially in the beginning when you are learning how to operate your camera, your alkaline penlights won't last you three days. But when you buy two sets of NiMH rechargeable batteries things will improve.
The fact that you have no viewfinder (impossible with a lens that can turn 180 degrees) can also cause a problem, because in bright sunlight the LCD screen is very hard to see, especially for people, like I, who need reading glasses and you just have to hope the pictures will turn out alright. But these are minor problems compared to all the advantages this camera offers and the great picture quality for a very reasonable price.
