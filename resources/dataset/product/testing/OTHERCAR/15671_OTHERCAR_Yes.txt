            I purchased my 2002 Grand Prix from a car rental agency.  The car had 26,777 miles on it when purchased.  The car came with many options including power windows, power door locks, power driver seat, power mirrors, traction control, ABS brakes and a CD player.  The power seat comes in handy because it also has a four way power lumber driver's seat which helps if you are short and need to raise the seat.  

I had to find a car that was safe.  When I drive in this car I feel completly safe.  When driving in the rain I am in total control of the car.  The traction control works and makes it feel like it the roads aren't even wet.  The dashboard has a indicator light to inform you if you are ever driving and get into a situation with low traction, you can also turn the traction off if you wish.  

I now have about 35,000 miles on the car and have only had to do normal maintance like oil changes.  I have had one problem with the low fuel light.  The light keeps coming on when there is gas in the car.  I have had to bring in the car twice to a GM service center to have the problem fixed.  Everything was covered under the warranty, it was just a hassle to have to wait to have the car fixed twice.  The warranty is great because it covers everything on the car except the tires and brake pads.  

I take my car on long trips a lot and find that the car is reliable and good on gas.  The seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room in the front and back.  I have a 170 pound rottweiler who fits in the back with no problems.  

I have seen the new 2004 Grand Prix's and hope to get one in the near future.
