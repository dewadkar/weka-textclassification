            This is a great van.  I had a 93 Quest that we drove for 100K mi. until it hit a bridge abutment, the car was totalled, but the occupants were unscathed.  Went out to replace it and drove/looked at every van out there.  GM vans -- they just don't get it.  Caravan/Voyager - getting stale, the Windstar was an unimpressive boat.  Honda - nice van, fold down rear seat is good, but the seats aren't that comfortable,
it's boxy and the handling -- as my 8 year old daughter says "it floats". Plus there's a 6 week wait and you pay sticker price (or more).
The new Quest is much better than my old one. It has a larger engine (not as large as some of the other vans, but plenty of power), better handling, not that it wasn't always good.  I bought the SE with the tuned suspension and it really drives well.  That's the outstanding thing about this van - it drives like a car - even better than a lot of cars, cornering is tight and controlled with little body roll, the ride is smooth and the buckets are comfortable and keep you in place.  Add to this the 60 month powertrain warranty (Honda's is 36), the video entertainment system (included), the multi-position 3rd seat that folds flat and slides up - everybody else but Honda makes you remove the seat (try that by yourself or when you are out and have an unexpected large item to get in the car).   Inside cargo room is a little less, but ask yourself how many times you are going to transport 4x8 sheets of plywood in your minivan. 90% of the time you are driving around with people and groceries - and shouldn't that drive be enjoyable?
