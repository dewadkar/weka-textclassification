            I want to start off by saying that all of my husband's first cars were Nissans and they were all very reliable.  That was one fo the reasons that my husband chose this SUV instead of the many others out on the market.

Some of the advantages of having an SUV are that it handles better than a sub-compact car and flooding is no problem, even if you live in Seattle.  This baby can go over potholes like they are little dents in the dirt.  The inside is another thing I can brag about, with all the available room.  It can fit up to five people very comfortably in the back, with lots of trunk space to space.  You could even bring the back seats down to make it flat, which is good for that hiking trip in Georgia.  

One of the things that I did not like about this SUV was that the engine was noisy, but that is my ONLY compliant.  Everything else is great with this SUV.  I LOVE IT!<br><br>
