            In 3/95 I purchased a '91 Cavalier RS convertible.  It had 43000 miles on
it at that time.  I wanted a convertible, and was more familiar with
US cars, especially the 3.1 V6 that was in this one.  It had the 3 speed
automatic, and despite that it averaged 24 mpg, with one trip I took
averaging 31 mpg.  Driving style was a big factor in fuel economy.

These cars have historically been either very good, or very bad.  Keep in
mind that these were entry-level vehicles.  If purchased used, the prior
owner/maintenance history would be a predicator of what lies ahead.

I owned the car for two years, and put another 55000 miles on it.  Besides
the usual maintenance items such as brake pads &amp; a new battery, the only
thing that went wrong was that the power-steering hose ruptured on me.
By all accounts, a fluke.  I never thought twice about driving anywhere
with this car.

The convertible top was easy to operate, but as with all convertibles, the
plastic rear window got cloudy, and cowl-shake was noticeable with the
top down.  Driving thru a car wash did show a leak, but again, certain
things are to be expected with a ragtop.
