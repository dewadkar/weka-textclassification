            I have to admit, I've always been a foreign car owner.  So when I started researching mid-sized four doors to drive, the Accord, Camry, and Maxima were first on my list.  It wasn't until I received a free gift certificate to go drive the Intrigue, that I became &quot;intrigued&quot;. 

The styling is smooth and sophisticated, yet very sporty with the optional rear spoiler.  The cockpit is spacious for the driver with ample leg room in the rear.  All the controls are at your fingertips, and this American made mid-sized has all the gadgets of a high end luxury sedan--dual climate control, steering wheel radio controls, CD player, moon-roof, you name it.  Don't let me forget to mention that the 215hp engine and 3000lb frame make for a smooth yet powerful ride.  

My issue with the car's performance was the green light acceleration ability.  It didn't respond well from a dead stop; however, acceleration at passing speeds was no problem at all.  It's not quite as much fun to drive as the 2000 Maxima, but the $25,000 sticker saves you some money to have fun with.<br><br>
