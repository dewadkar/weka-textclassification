            Thinking about buying a newly designed 2000 Celica? You better first test drive the new 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse before making any decisions. The new Eclipse is a sports car with a touch of elegance, but don't worry the people at Mitsubishi didn't get soft on us. The Eclipse GT (6 cylinder series) packs a whole lot of punch. Its precise steering out-maneuvers the Celica and it wins the battle for torque. The Eclipse GT packs a cool 200 horses under its hood, compared to the 180 four cylinder Celica. For the body I can't help but see a little Ferarri Testarosa. If safety is a concern (which should be) the Eclipse out-does the Celica, taking a play from Volvo book it not only has reinforced doors but also side-impact airbags. You can drive out of the dealership with the new fully loaded Eclipse GT for about $24,000.<br><br>
