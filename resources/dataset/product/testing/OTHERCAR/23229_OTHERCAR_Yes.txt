            I bought my car because it gave me a lot of options and I didn't have to pay a lot for them. My car the only thing missing is the leather seats. I have everything else: Power mirrors windows and locks, Premium sound dual airbags, sport tuned suspension and other things. It's really quiet, you can hardly hear the engine down the highway. Besides this annoying noise in the suspension (which I have to get fixed) it's a great car. I have the 2.0, 4 cylinder, 16 valve engine wich I think is too small for that car. The Breeze should of never have come with that engine but that's my opinion. My car came with 30,000 miles and the money I payed for it with all the options I got, I thought i got a great deal. I plan to keep that car for a couple of years. I'm starting college soon so it's a great car for me because it's fuel economy is great too. I spend 15 dollars on gas and get a full tank of plus Gasoline at 1.45. It gives about 5-6 days if I push it. I love my Breeze. Whoever is looking for fuel efficient, family car, four door and low insurance cost should defenitly look into buying a Plymouth Breeze. Ever since I got it, it has never been to shop for anything. I change the oil every three thousand miles soon I will change the spark plugs and brakes and it will be good as new. It's very comfortable, even in the back seat. Very spacious. I just don't like it's very big dashboard because it takes away from it's engine compartment making all the parts in there too jumbled up together. It's like I said , my Breeze is a Breeze.<br><br>
