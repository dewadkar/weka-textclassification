            Ok, since I am now on my third Honda Civic...I thought I needed to tell you what makes me coming back to this car over and over....First of all let me tell you I have gone the gamut on Civics.  I had the low end DX Hatchback which was excellent...it really zipped around and was a great value.  

When I could finally afford more, I upgraded to the high end Civic, the EX model (2 dr coupe) which has been my last two cars....why have I had so many?  Well, I leased and then just yesterday I decided to buy a 2000 model.  

The 2000 Civic is something else...its sporty yet not a sportscar (which saves on insurance) and it looks good.  The EX model has all of the perks including: body colored mirrors and moldings, a moonroof, CD player/stereo with 6 speakers, power everything (windows, mirrors, doors), cruise control, a/c, keyless entry, etc...I might suggest for a few dollars more you add the factory alarm to protect your investment.

The Civic is a great value for the money, not only does it look good, it gets good gas mileage, requires minimal repair and has an EXCELLENT resale value (which means the depreciation is very low over time).

The only limitation that I can find with the Civic EX 2DR Coupe is the number of colors its available in which are: black, red, white, green and silver...(the four door is available in 2-4 additional colors).  

I highly recommmend this car for anyone looking for a sleek, sporty vehicle with great pricing and the ability to hold up over time!<br><br>
