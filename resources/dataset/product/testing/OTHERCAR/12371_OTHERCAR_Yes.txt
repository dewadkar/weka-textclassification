            When I was out looking for cars, I did not start out looking for a Grand Prix, or even a Pontiac for that matter.  This car caught my eye on the corner of the used car lot because I had never seen anything like it.  I had seen hundreds of the other Grand Prixs of this model, and to be honest, I hated the way they looked.  They were just so plain and inconspicuous.

But this 1996 white Grand Prix GTP Special Edition coupe was different.  It was well rounded and sleek looking with its fog lights, spoiler, high polished aluminum wheels, and hood vents.  I was impressed.  The 215hp V6 DOHC 3400 series engine is a wonderful engine.  It runs great and has had no problems at all.  I usually get about 22 mpg (I drive mostly city with a little bit of highway driving to college each day (with some quick take offs for fun)).  This car was just more that I was ever expecting that I could afford.  

I have only had one problem with this car.  After a while, it became a little difficult to get it started;  it would always start, but sometimes it would take a little while.  But, two weeks after this problem started occurring, I received a recall notice from my Pontiac dealer about the spark plug wires on this car.  I took it in to have the recall work done on it (for free), and have never had this problem again.

This is just a great all around car.  This is a car that is sporty, fun to drive, and also has room to take people around in.  I tend to think white is the best color to have on it -- my car really never looks dirty.  Looking at the car from about five feet away, any dirt that is there isn't really noticeable (except on the windows).

This car has a lot of features such as dual airbags,steering wheel radio controls, and in-dash CD player.  This model has a bunch of other available options such as a trip computer and a HUD that weren't on mine.  I have been so impressed with this car;  it's just unfortunate that Pontiac didn't get this model right until its last year in production.<br><br>
