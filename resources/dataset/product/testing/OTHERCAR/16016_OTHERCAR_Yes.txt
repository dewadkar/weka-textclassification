            I had a 1993 Toyota Camry and I absolutely loved that car! I never had one problem with it, it ran smoothly and never needed to go to the shop.  It was nice and roomy, held 5 passengers comfortably, and traveled well in all kinds of weather.  The seats were comfortable and the trunk was nice and big and held lots of groceries!
The stereo sounded good (though I didn't have a CD player) and the air conditioning worked extremely well in the Florida heat.  When I first got the car, we lived in Florida, and then we had it transported to Oregon. It went through the long trip very nicely! My car was light blue and I loved its sleek design.  Its brakes always worked really well and was easy to maneuver and turn.


What I really LOVED about the car, though, is its safety record.  It had one airbag at the time, crumple zones, and the engine drops down underneath you so you don't end up with an engine coming right at you if you are in an accident.  This is a good thing!!! Halloween day 1995 I was in a very bad head on collision and totaled my poor Camry.  I tell you what though, the car did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do and I walked away from a potentially fatal accident.  I hit a Ford F-150 extended cab pickup with a horse trailer on it.  I was wearing my seat belt (VERY IMPORTANT!! ALWAYS ALWAYS!!!!!) and the air bag went off just like it was supposed to.  My daughter was two at the time and was in the back in her car seat.  She also was fine, only having bitten her tongue.

The paramedics were amazed that I was as ok as I was.  I thoroughly believe that the Camry saved my life by being so well designed for safety. I really wanted to buy another Camry but I bought a Subaru instead because it had all wheel drive, which is needed driving in Oregon. If I still lived in Florida, though, I definitely would have purchased another Camry.  Toyota has made a great car in the Camry, I highly recommend it! I'm living proof of the car's safety!!!
