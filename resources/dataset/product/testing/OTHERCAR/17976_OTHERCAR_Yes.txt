            I was looking for a &quot;new Vehicle&quot; about two years ago and really couldn't find one that was worth the money that the dealers wanted to sell them at.  Then my friend said that I should look at Jeeps and see what they have for me, I just might like them.  Well, let me just say that he was right about one thing.  Not only did I like it, I loved it!!  At first, they look like they drive rough and wouldn't be a good &quot;daily commute&quot;.  Not only are they a great ride, but they don't get that bad gas.  I get about 17-20 miles per gallon.  That is not bad, because for what you get it is worth it.  I also was looking at the option for the hard top.  This is something that I recommend if you live in a colder climate.  The soft top will get you by, but the hard top keeps in the warmth and makes it a less noisy ride.  The only real problem that I had was the turning signal.  It sometimes wouldn't turn on.  That was taken care of with the warranty.  
  Now for all you off-roading buffs out there!  You got to get one to really know how it is to off-road.  There is nothing like driving where a car can't!  It is a great vehicle to take and go into the mountains, camp and then drive out knowing that if something happens (snow blizzard, rain, ect...) you will be able to make it to work on Monday.
