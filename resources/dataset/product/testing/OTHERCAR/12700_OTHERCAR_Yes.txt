            We bought this car new and were in love with it from the beginning.  It gets great gas mileage.  Easy to drive even on those long trips.  It runs great!  The heater and A/C will run you right out of it.  Works too well if you ask me.  Even as a 4 cylinder it has power to get up and go.  We bought the 2 door basic model.  Very inexpensive, well worth the money, and you get more than you pay for.  I would not recommend buying this car if you have children in car seats.  It is a bit of a pain to get them in and out of the back seat.  The trunk doesn't have much space left once you put a full size stroller in it.  Cup holders are located in awkward places.  And there are only 2 of them.  No enough for my liking.  This car would make a great car for a teenï¿½s first car or a young couple with no children and on a tight budget.<br><br>
