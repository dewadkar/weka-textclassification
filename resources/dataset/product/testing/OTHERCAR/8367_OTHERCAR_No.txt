            I purchased a beautiful 97 green/blue (changes color) back in May. Thinking this was the car of my dreams. I recently had my service engine soon light come on. If any of you have experienced this &quot;LIGHT&quot; before it means the start of trouble. I have very low miles on this vehicle, 19,689 to be exact. Too soon for this type of problems. I took it directly in to my Pontiac shop and they stated this is very common. I have a limited time left before my warranty expires, this last job would have cost around $500.00. I'm thinking about selling and purchasing a new SUV. So much for my DREAM CAR! And I really do love this car!<br><br>
