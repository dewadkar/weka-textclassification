            So you drool all over your neighbor's Lexus ES300, but you two college kids to support. What to do? The answer: buy a Camry V6. It's mechanically identical to the Lexus, minus 6 grand. What a deal. 

The car in question here is the Camry CE V6. Essentially, it's a stripper equipped with the V6 engine. The next trim level is the XLE V6, which has virtually all the goodies one might want. 

But make no mistake, the CE V6 is not a poorly equipped car. It has all the essential amenities such as ABS, power windows/locks, cruise control, air conditioning... All the essential things are here. 

The crown jewel of this car is the engine. The 3 litre V6 pumps out 193HP and 200lb-ft of torque. But the selling point here is not power, it's the smoothless over the four cylinder engine that is going to be the main draw for the V6 model. Regardless, I must point out that the engine has plenty of thrust on tap. Slam the gas, the driver is immediately rewarded with the sensation of being pushed back into the seats as the tachometer swings upward. Under 3000rpm, there isn't much going on. 4000rpm is where the party is. Once the engine speed passes that mark, it lets out a nice low growl, as the the car darts forward with authority. Very nice. 

Same level of praise can't be laid on the automatic transmission. Yes, it shifts smoothly and silently, but that's part of the problem. Most of the time, I just don't have a clue to what gear I am on. Because the transmission upshifts so readily, and the engine so quiet, any driver involvement is deleted from the equation. Having said that, I must admit that the transmission downshifts promptly when you press hard on the gas. But still, changing the shift point to a higher RPM level would make driving this car a more involving experience. 

The ride is smoother than a good bottle of X.O. brandy. Interior is so quiet at highway speed, you'd think it's a library. After having owned the car for three years, I still marvel at its level of refinement. 

Steering is slicker than a greased roulette wheel at intown speeds, but feels accurate nevertheless. At highway speed, steering still feels a tad on the light side, but acceptable. It's not hard at all to keep the car in a straight line. 

And in a straight line is where this car excels. Get it on a freeway and just let the miles roll by. Cruising at 120kph is effortless, and it can easily achieve comfortable crusing speed of 140kph. You simply can't get this kind of refinement for the money anywhere. 

Is there a downside? Oh yes. This car, despite all of its virtues, is about as sporty as your fax machine. The engineers made the compromise of sacrificing sportiness for ride comfort. The buyer must live with that compromise. 

The biggest complaint here is that the spring is too soft. Stomp on the brakes, the car dives. Slam on the gas, it squats. Turn into a corner aggresssively, and the car immediately pitches and rolls, while the tire howls like Babe in a slaughterhouse. 

This doesn't imply that the Camry is a ill handling car. Not at all. Even when you drive it hard, it complies with your request without complaining too loudly. But it does it in a way that is devoid of any stimuli and feedback. By its very nature, this car don't like o hustle. 

Oh yes, and the fuel economy is simply evil. It drinks premium gas, and it drinks lots of at. Or at least in city driving. On the highway, the gas milage is quite respectable. 28mpg is the norm. In the city, however, that number falls to 21. When I bought the car, prices in Canada was 55 cents for a litre of premium gas. Now, it's 85. Everytime I fill this thing up, I cringe. If you care about fuel economy, and you do a lot of city driving, buy the four cylinder model. 

So, in many respects, this is a perfect car. It's cheap, and it's refined, and it definitely give you more car for the money than most of the stuff on the market. But, despite all that, this is not a car that I love. It asks so little from the driver, it's almost as if I am not needed at all. To some people, this is a god thing. Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

At full throttle, my old Honda sounds like lawnmower, and when it rolls down the road, all kind of stranage noises crepts into the cabin. But you know what? I love that car. It wants to hustle, and it begs you to drive it hard. Whatever it lacks in power, it makes up for it in soul. 

And I just wish the Camry has some of that. 

Update (Feb, '01): The car developed a groaning noise on the front passenger side whenever it hits a bump. The dealer determined it was a faulty strut mount and fixed it under warranty. There are other problems, but they are minor. A burned-out bulb, loose handbrake..etc.After the strut mount was replaced, the car now handles much better. But still, it's no BMW.
