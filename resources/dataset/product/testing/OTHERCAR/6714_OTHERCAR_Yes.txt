            I purchased my 1992 Chevy Lumina Euro about 8 months ago. My first car, I took out my loan for 3500 and bought the car for $4500. This turned out to be a great investment.

     I didnt know it at the time, but now I am glad i got a 92. Apparently the 91's had some major brake trouble. My euro has 4 wheel discs with ABS, and they've always done what they're supposed to do: stopped the car. And not only that, they stop it well. Don't buy a 91 Lumina unless youre willing to pay a lot for brake repairs. 
   
     I love the looks of the EURO model lumina's. Maybe its just that red trim, the big 16" tires, and that huge spoiler, but believe it makes all the diference. If you buy a regular lumina, i definately recommend getting the spoiler off a euro. 
     The 3.1L V6 engine is a great one. Its one of chevy's finest engines; it is known for its reliability as well as its power. At 145 rated horsepower and 160 pounds of torque, it's quick too. Right off the  line is when it really stands out. Its great having the ability to lay down a little rubber whenever necessary.  Its midrange power is adequete, although somewhat lacking. The 4-speed OD makes a lot of noise in 3rd gear withought actually doing anything. Its not until it FINALLY shifts at the redline when it really kicks. The car has great passing ability and really goes when it finally shifts at about 60-70 MPH. It could be faster but I'm satisfied. It'll kill a taurus any day.

     Its not until you look inside when the car really shines. My euro came equipped with power locks windows, power trunk release, and my favorite feature: the power driver's seat. I love tilting it back and sliding it as far back as it goes. VERY comfortable, the perfect car for road trips. When i was looking for a car, i knew that i wanted something with 4 doors with a lot of room.  Maybe it's just me, but I hate small cars that sacrifice comfort for just a little more performance. Not worth it, I'd say.
People always compliment me on how comfortable the back seats are... and if you slide up the 2 front seats, you'll have room to do whatever you (and your girlfriend ;) want to do back there... 
 I love the simply designed dash...It's a work of art.  Chevrolet used very little plastic and minimized cluster. It's kind of soothing to get in my car after riding around in my friend's Pontiac. Pontiac does not know how to design the interior of their automobiles. My euro has fake woodgrain trim. I love it. It looks great. The big black leather wrapped steering wheel makes driving just that much better. The car has a great feel for the road, i love the handling; very smooth, and the 16" tires make taking corners at quicker speeds a lot more stable and tight.

     If there's one thing Chevy perfected on the Lumina, it's the exhaust system. The lumina (3.1 anyway) sounds like a musclecar. You'll think there are glasspacks for mufflers, but actually they're not. Hit the gas a few times and you'll scare off any Honda or Ford (Taurus) that thinks they have a chance. Stick on a few chrome exhaust pipe tips and It'll look even better.

     Mileage on my car isn't the best right now. I average about 220-250 miles on a full tank (about 17 gallons). I have close to 100,000 miles on her, however. When I hit 100k I'll put in new plugs and change the oxygen sensor, the sensor that tells your engine how much gas and oxygen to mix for the ideal fuel economy. As they get older, they tend to not mix the correct amount, therefore using more gas then necessary. Apparently they are supposed to be changed every 100k, although they are often neglected.

     As for the sound system, the factory Delco cassete/radio had to go. When I dropped in a new Pioneer GM-Sized CD player(DEH-P47DH, checkout my epinion on it), I was amazed at how much better the speakers sounded! The 6x9's pounded, with tons of bass. They did not have the greatest high's however. All in all, if you're not in really big on your car's sound system, than the factory speakers in this car will more than satisfy you. I dropped in some Alpine 4x6 & 6x9's, and suddenly my car has this top-of-the-line sound system. The 6x9's make having subs pointless and are often mistaken for them. Even if you purchase new 6x9's, you won't notice a huge difference in bass. If you have a lumina and want to buy new speakers, than I recommend getting new front's first. It'll give you the high's you need and you'll still get plenty of bass from those 6x9's.
     I have had no repairs on my car, and it now has 92K on it. The day I bought my car I fell in love with her. I become friends with people simply because they have the same type of car. I feel the lumina is the perfect car anyone looking for a comfortable, reliable, 4- door sedan with a little kick.
