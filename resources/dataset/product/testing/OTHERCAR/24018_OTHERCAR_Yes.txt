            There I go doing it again, putting the same word in the Pros and Cons list, that word being 'value' in this case. More on that later...:-)

Lest you're as confused as I am about models in the Impreza range, let me try to clarify:

The GX in Australia is the base model, which I believe is called the TS in the US. Standard 2 litre engine and lowest spec level, though you still get All Wheel Drive, ABS brakes and most of the essentials, just not the fancy stuff. Sedan or hatch.

The RX is the better specced 2 litre with all the kit, including CD player, decent enough stereo, electrics and so on. Once again, sedan or hatch.

The RS is almost the same, but has the 2.5 litre boxer 4 cylinder engine and the same racing seats as the WRX.

The WRX is the butt-kicking turbo version, but otherwise the same spec as the RS.

In Australia we also have a WRX STi which is the super-quick race tuned version of the WRX and is a seriously quick motor car.

Let me make some general comments about the whole Impreza range, and then talk about some of the specfic variants.

The external design is not to everyone&#146s liking. Cute, but ugly might be one way of looking at them.

The Impreza is All Wheel Drive (AWD) across the whole range, and as you'd expect that makes for some pretty decent handling. All the cars have a tendency to mild initial understeer then remain pretty evenly balanced through corners. They grip like leeches in the dry and even better in the wet. With the more powerful models (WRX, RS) you can kick the tail out into a little oversteer coming out of corners, but it's all very controllable.

These cars are all very well built, and give a feeling of rigidity and stability. The hatchbacks obviously have a little more body flex and are slightly less balanced in corners, but that&#146s only to be expected from the higher larger bodies and slightly greater weight.

Internally, the cars are generally functional, with good instruments, and everything falling nicely to hand. There&#146s a general feeling of dullness in the lower specced models. Even the most expensive seem a little bit equipment shy. For the money I was hankering for more gadgets, frankly.

Interior space is obviously much of a muchness in all models. Nice legroom in the front, and adequate armroom even though the car is on the narrow side. I am 6 foot and with my seat back there was still just enough legroom in the rear to fit the teenager without too many complaints. Rear seats are reasonably comfortable over long hauls. All in all, rear accommodation is better than I thought it would be in a small sedan.

It&#146s the front seats which are one of my bugbears. In the cheaper models they are reasonably comfortable. But in the RS and WRX, Subaru insisted on &#145upgrading&#146 them to those wretched racing-style sports seats. Plenty of people love them, I admit, but I think they are the spawn of Satan. I am 6 foot tall, slim and quite muscular, with fairly broad shoulders and lats. I&#146m not Arnold Schwatsisname, but I&#146m not Homer Simpson either. And I basically cannot fit in these seats. The huge side bolsters don&#146t hold me in place. Instead they stop me ever being comfortable because they are simply not wide enough for my lats/shoulders. The back support is also too flat and unsupportive. The seats are probably fine for people of smaller build, and I guess the typical Japanese buyer falls into that category.

Sound systems in the better models are good. The RS/WRX get the 6-stacker CD option in many markets. The system goes plenty loud with tight and articulate bass, and clean top end. If anything it&#146s a little bass heavy, and you&#146ll notice this with people talking on the radio, but if you&#146re into rock or rap you&#146ll love it.

But you&#146re never going to buy one of these cars for their lush and lavish interior refinements. They are all a little lacklustre in this department--even the RS and WRX with all the kit feel a little downmarket.

What you might buy them for is the engines. Forget the 2L--it won&#146t inspire you. It lacks low-down torque, idles a tad roughly and can be pretty noisy and harsh when pushed. It&#146s not a bad engine, but it&#146s unexciting.

The turbo version in the WRX is a different beast entirely. It&#146s smooth and torquey through the whole range, there is next to no turbo lag, and the power is fantastic! This car is a flyer, and the best bang for the buck you can get, in my opinion. Close to Supercar performance for the price of a family sedan.

But the problems with the WRX are threefold. Firstly, turbos are harder work to look after and maintain--for a long-term investment, the family man might consider the cost of servicing and potential reliability issues. Not that the WRX has a bad reputation in this regard, far from it.

Secondly, WRXs are often thrashed by their owners, and this affects resale value. And thirdly, at least in Australia, about 40% of WRXs get stolen at some stage. This is scary, frankly. And the Subaru security features, alarm and so on, seem not to be able to do much about this.

Did I mention the RS? This 2.5 litre boxer 4 is a tremendous engine. It is smooth and quiet, perhaps even more torquey than the WRX at very low revs, and with more than enough power to balance the car into and out of corners. It&#146s not a rocket like its more expensive sibling, but boy is it fun to drive, nonetheless, and it&#146s considerably cheaper.

So why do I put value as a Pro and a Con? Because it depends on your criteria. If you&#146re after the quickest sedan experience available, then the Scooby WRX is great value compared to equivalent performing vehicles. But then, so is a Kawasaki 1100 motorbike, which will blow the Scooby into the weeds for half the price. However, if performance is your primary criteria, the WRX is hard to beat.

Looking at the cheaper models, which do not have the standout performance, value is harder to find. I couldn&#146t shake the impression that one is paying a premium for All Wheel Drive and the Subaru name, when much better equipment and feature levels can be found at the same price-point.

Nevertheless, these are all very fine cars, and the RS and WRX are standouts in their different ways. I was all set to buy an RS, but the seats alone convinced me otherwise. I even asked the dealer to change the seats for those in the cheaper model, but they wouldn&#146t, so they lost a sale. I am pretty happy with the Peugeot 307 I bought instead, but I still miss the RS at times.
