              In July I purchased my first Brand New vehicle, a Chevy S-10. Let me say that I am quite impressed. The ride is smooth, and the engine is quiet, even at interstate speeds. The interior is very comfortable and roomy, especially for a small truck. The ergonomics of the instrument panel are impressive indeed. I also enjoy the extra room that the extended cab has to offer. The exterior is also quite impressive. It is very sporty looking for a pickup truck. The wheels look great!
  The features that this truck has to offer also continue to amaze me. It comes standard with daytime running lamps, and the headlights and taillights automatically come on when it gets dark. It also has 4 wheel anti-lock brakes, which kept me out of an accident once. The sound system is quite impressive for a factory system, and boasts 6 speakers(two of which are highs), and a new feature called Speed Compensated Volume, which automatically adjusts your volume at higher vehicle speeds, to make up for the extra noise one would expect while traveling at high speeds.
  Many people who own the S-10 claim that the four-cylinder is underpowered. I thought so to when I first drove my truck, but after I got used to driving my truck, and it was properly &quot;broken in&quot; it has proven otherwise. My truck will keep up with some of the best V-6 automobiles, and has great &quot;get up and go&quot;. The standard transmission helps the truck to gain speed faster. The Vortec engine has certainly proven itself to me.
  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants the convenience of a pickup truck, without sacrificing comfort or looks. It's an excellent automobile, and after 6,000 miles, I have no complaints at all.
