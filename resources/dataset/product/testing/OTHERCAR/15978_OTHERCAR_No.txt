            My husband and needed a car, size and price were our two priorities. We came across this Buick Skylark. It seemed ok to me and the price was right. I am so sorry that we bought this car. 
I do feel like I am riding on a large skateboard. We recently went on a trip, I didn't like the way it felt on the highway either. Yes it was in our price range and yes it is the right size for us, other than that, I don't like it at all!! Did you ever ride in a car and you could feel that it was a good, heavy sturdy car? Well no this one!! 
I would not recommend it to anyone. If I have anything to do with it, we will be trading it in soon!!<br><br>
