            The DC210 Plus camera is a medium priced camera that is user friendly. The
booklets that accompany it are very well written and easy to understand.
Because of the logical format of these instructions, you are able to 
pick up the camera, use it with confidence, connect it with your computer,
and download your pictures. The quality of the pictures are comparable with those of your load and shoot 35mm cameras. The software included with
the camera allows you to edit, enhance, modify, and print your pictures with minimal problems.
The LCD viewing allows you to retake the picture if you are not satisfied
with the original picture. You can simply delete the first picture if you are unhappy with the way it came out. You do not have to use up your memory with unwanted pictures.
The flash can be turned completely off which allows for close-ups without bounce back glare. It also has a Red Eye elimination feature built into the flash program. 
For the money, this camera comes with many built-in features that you used to get only with more expensive cameras.
