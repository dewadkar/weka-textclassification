            Hi,

   My name is Steve, and I am a computer science major in college. I work for a professional photography company part time.  I did not purchase this camera, but I did have a chance to use it extensively and compare it to a large number of other digital camera's.  This camera stuck out among the rest, which is why I am recommending it.  I am sure you have heard about all of the features, so I am just going to talk about what you really need to know.
  
Pro's:

Great pictures- 1.3 megapixel. These looked almost photo quality when printed on professional digital imaging equipment.  I noticed a big difference between the the Kodak DC215 (1 megapixel) and this one.

LCD- you have to see this one.  It is way brighter than my DC215, and after seeing this camera, it influenced me to sell my Kodak DC215. It resembles a sharp TFT screen on a laptop, and has a good refresh rate.

This camera is rugged.  It looks like it can take a beating.

Sliding door protects lens and flash from dust, fingerprints, ect.

Cons:

No optical zoom- digital zoom decreases image quality.

Flimsy smartmedia door, which may break off, but is not too big of a problem.

The green LCD on/off button is hard to press down if you have big fingers.

Overall:

    This is the best simple starter camera without zoom.  The smartmedia storage option enables you to use the very handy floppy disk adapter.  I can go to my friends house, take some pictures, and put them on his computer easily.  My coolpix 990 does not let me do this, because it uses the compact flash type memory.  If you can handle the lack of optical zoom, than this is your camera.  <br><br>
