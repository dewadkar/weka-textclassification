            My favorite little buddy graduated from college last December and got a real job, and she needed a new car. We were both vehicle shopping at the same time but with very different needs. She was going from a gas guzzling SUV that she puttered around in as student with few bills to a small car with better gas mileage, and I was upgrading from a Toyota Corolla I&#146d bought used and had driven into the ground after 8 years to a 4-wheel drive to haul little boys and gear around. 

Little Buddy decided to go with the <b>Kia Rio</b>. So, I&#146ve been bopping around with her for several months in her new little car and have had it for two weeks now on switch off as she travels across the state in my Xterra to move back home for another new and better job. I&#146m thrilled for her and can&#146t wait for her to move back though do miss my vehicle (-:

Since I had just come off driving a low-end small car, it wasn&#146t a big adjustment to get back in the full-time mini car groove. This one is rounded off enough that it&#146s impossible to see the front and rear while sitting in the car, so it feels smaller than it is. It doesn&#146t have much front and back out there, so that isn&#146t a problem. Certainly, it&#146s easy to find a parking space even in town where they have parallel park. Just don&#146t expect to haul a lot of stuff home in that trunk.

Inside, it&#146s tight. With the curvy shape, it simply wraps around and does not leave much room for heads or legs or pocketbooks. I&#146m 5ï¿½&#148, and I would guess that I&#146m near the far end of the size for comfort in this vehicle. My boys are still kid-sized at 10 and 13, and they are fine in the passenger seat and back but with little room for backpacks, lunch boxes and other assorted boy toys. I&#146m glad I don&#146t have to ride in the back though because the leg space is very minimal, and I have long legs.

When I get in, I throw my stuff in the back, because it won&#146t fit between the seats. They included the console there in the center, which has a drink holder. If you want to drink and drive (Pepsi&#151of course), then it&#146s rather complicated to grab the can. You have to put your elbow practically in the back seat to get your hand to where the drink sits. I don&#146t know who designed that, but it does not work well.

Over to the left of the wheel, they have a little compartment for change. It&#146s small. Don&#146t expect to round up enough money to buy a burger there. You&#146ll have to look under the seats for that. To the right and up on top of the dash, they have an indented section for items. That&#146s convenient and easy to reach, but things slide off that space. The door has an molded pocket for items, but that holds little things like a map or maybe two maps. The glove box is small as well, but it will hold the owner&#146s manual and a box of Altoids.

While I wouldn&#146t expect the interior to be plush given the price and size of the vehicle, the quality is not what it should be. The plastic pieces feel flimsy. That&#146s the same problem I had with my 1987 Mustang which had all manner of problems like door handles splitting off. The seat material and carpet materials are close to plastic though would be considered material. They are hard to clean and don&#146t really look like they&#146ve just been cleaned when they have been. While my friend&#146s car has not started to show this kind of wear, I suspect it will much sooner than it should. This one is just not built to handle any rough treatment.

The only real cosmetic (?) problem I&#146ve seen so far is that the driver&#146s door does not want to close and latch. It will look like it did close, but the light will come on and the beeper will go off. About half the time, I end up reclosing the door at the stop sign at the end of my road. It should be lining up better and closing better for a new car.

As far as driving, this one holds to the road and responds to the wheel just fine. It&#146s been rainy the last 2 weeks, and that has not been a problem with the driving. The shape does mean that it rains in the windows if you open them even a little crack wide.

Though I don&#146t expect a lot of power with 4 cyl, this one really does not have any get up and go. I&#146ve driven a number of little cars like my Corolla and some Pintos my dad favored when I was young, and the Kia is certainly not as strong when it comes to putting on the gas. It will rev like it is taking off, but it creeps slowly up on speed. I would not suggest trying to merge in quickly on the highway. 

With the low power, I would expect great gas mileage. That is not really the case. While it does get about 30 mpg, some of the new 6 cyl cars will do that much and with more power. The tank is small at under 12 gallons, so this car requires frequent fill ups. At least it only runs me about $13 every time if I get it close to E.

Of course, the price is the big thing with the Kia. It is the lowest around for a new car. The base is about $9K but will run higher than that with some options. If you&#146re pushing the $12K mark anyway, I would strongly suggest looking at the Corolla or Neon. For myself, I&#146d go with a used in those brands over new in the Kia. I paid $7K for my used Corolla and put 150,000 miles on it. That was one of the best purchases I&#146ve ever made.

The thing that sold my friend on the Kia was the 10-year/100,000 mile coverage on the vehicle. That is the best it gets. The only problem on that, which my brother who partly owns a used car lot notes, is that it&#146s only good if Kia stays in business. He said he&#146d promise the moon too as a start up. Of course, Kia could be the next Volkswagen Bug company. Goodness knows those little Beetle cars have kept going and going. 

Customer service was also important to my buddy, since she was moving away from friends and family (but coming back now). She has a number to call if she has any problems including running out of gas. If I run out of gas, then it&#146s my bad. If she does, she can call Kia to come out with a can of gas and get her started. That is a strange perk and one that I would not really need. I&#146d rather just keep some gas in my vehicle.

My guess is that my buddy will be shopping for a new car soon, and the Kia&#146s don&#146t sell back for much. 

If you&#146re thinking about the Kia Rio, then be sure to read up. If you put Kia Rio (or Kia Ria if you can't spell for beans) in Google search, you&#146ll see that a lot of folks have had a lot of problems with this little car. While it could work out for a single small person who needs a good price and pretty good mileage, I would say that there are other better choices out there. A car is a big investment no matter what you buy, so be sure before you sign that dotted line.
