            I purchased a first model year ('91) ES model and absolutely love it!  It's made by Mitsubishi in Japan so it's quality level is very high.  The 24 valve, six cylinder engine is quick and can spin the front tires quickly if you're not careful.  It's cornering ability is one of it's praises!  The large tires and wide stance grip the pavement with precision.  With the front wheel drive pulling you through the curves, it's very hard to loose the back end.  And yet, it has a comfortable ride on the freeway for long trips.  It is, however, fairly expensive to maintain and the technology is so advanced you can't do any work on it yourself other than oil changes and air filter.  I have had to replace first gear, but that was covered by the warranty.  Gas mileage is OK with a lead foot at about 20 mpg.  When calling for parts prices, make sure you call both Chrysler Corp and Mitsubishi because the same part may be cheaper at one compared to the other!  Also, the sports seats are hard on long trips - I recommend sheepskin seat covers.  Although it's listed as a four seater for insurance purposes, the rear seat is just for looks.  Enjoy!
