            I bought my Canon Powershot A70 about 2.5 months ago and I love it.  It cost me approx. $270 online, plus $15 for faster delivery.  I could not find this camera available locally at any of the major retail stores (it was always "sold out").  And, I really wanted it based on reviews I had read (both here and other places).

When I got the camera I was very pleased.  It is small, compact, and light weight.  However, it still seems sturdy.  The camera comes with batteries (AA), usb cord, 2 cds of software, and an a/v cord to connect it to a tv or vcr.  It can be used right out of the box, but the included memory card will only hold a handful of pictures and when you see how easy it is to use this camera you'll want to take plenty of photos and mini-movies.  I immediately bought an additional 256 memory card (the included 16 card is a joke), a card reader, and a universal camera bag. 

The camera takes very good photos, and has 3.2 megapixel resolution.  I am not an expert photographer, and I don't think that expert photographers are who Canon intended this camera for.  I take photos of my nieces and on vacation - and the quality of the photos is excellent for my use.  

The camera is probably typical of most digital cameras.  To take a picture you turn it on, select which mode you are using, aimed the camera, push the button half way to focus, then all the way to take the shot.  You can view the photos on the very adequate LCD screen and decide whether to keep them or send them to the trash can.  All of this is covered in the manual, which is thorough.

The camera has optical AND digital zoom modes.  The digital makes pictures a little grainy.  The camera takes AA batteries, which don't last forever but are easy to replace on the spur of the moment, if need be.  (I would suggest buying rechargeable batteries.)

I experienced a little trouble with photos of myself in front of a black curtain - I am very pale skinned and the contrast between me and the backdrop created a wash out of my entire face.  The manual does explain this in the troubleshooting section, which I suggest you read prior to taking photos because it does offer a lot of good advice.

The included software is easy to use.  I have yet to try photo stitching yet, although I did use the camera in photo stitching mode to take pictures of the panorama around Central Park (I just need to upload them and try out the software end of this).  If you are interest in storing your photos, organizing them, and doing minor changes than the included software is all that you need.  If you want to go crazy then you'll need actual photo editing software such as Photoshop. 

I have used the camera in several of its "modes", however, I have yet to tackle anything that isn't automatic.  I have some particular favorites:

Movie mode - I have taken several mini-movies of my nieces dancing around the pool or just being silly on vacation.  It is great fun to bring the camera back to the room, plug the cord into the tv and watch the play back almost immediately.  And the kids get a big kick out of it.  And, this camera also records sound, which it is my understanding many of the major manufactures do not include.  It seems like a necessity to me, and the quality of both sound and video on the tv screen seems pretty darn good.

Timer mode - you can set this camera to have a delay (either 2 or 10 seconds, I think).  I figured out that the camera easily locks on to my old videocamera tripod and the delay mode helped me to take some "self-portraits" which turned out kind of bad, but that's mostly because I don't find myself to be very photogenic!  But that's not the camera mode.

Repeat  mode - this is great.  You hold the button down and it takes repeated shots until you take your finger off the button.  Great for action shots when you don't want to have to time the picture just right.  Also, just kind of fun to use and makes you feel like you are a fashion photographer (all you need is music and one of those big fans).

Also, watching the pictures as a slide show on the tv is great.  The initial reason that I was drawn to this camera was because I wanted a digital camera that had a movie mode with sound AND because I wanted an a/v connection to a tv (which many cameras have, but don't do without it as it is a great feature).  On my most recent Contiki tour out West my roommate had a digital camera and half way through the point, in our Bass Lake chalet, we all sat down and watched a slide show of the past week.  It was a great way to relive the vacation we were still having.  An awesome feature that I use all the time.

The cost of this camera is reasonably low - especially for all of the features you get.  The quality seems excellent to me (but, remember, I'm not looking for professional level photography).  If you want to take it easy you can just use one of the "modes".  

There is also the potential to manually set everything (which I have not tried yet)...however, when I scroll through the onscreen menus I get a little overwhelmed by what looks a bit too complex.  However, I've used the menus a couple of times and the manual is well written and takes you through everything STEP by STEP.
