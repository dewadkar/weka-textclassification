            I bought this camera to replace a 2 year old Sony Mavica (which I adored, but then computers started coming without floppy drives and it was big and...and it was stolen).

I did a lot of research. I was really looking for the S20, and while waiting for it to come to the market, Canon announced the S100. I had the opportunity to see them both side by side at the Macworld Expo in New York city, and the S100 is so tiny that it was worth losing the megapixel. I don't print pictures anyway (but if I did, I could still print a 4x6 - standard - photo at 300 dpi which is very very good).

I hate to carry things. I carry a bag, grudgingly, when I have to. This camera is the size of a pack of cigarettes, and almost as light.

The image quality is superb. The color depth is magnificent and the color accuracy is close to true. There is very little blur even on fast action shots.

The flash is bright enough to go some little distance, and there is a light that goes on for a second or two before you shoot a flash photo which helps to avoid red eyes and also allows the camera to focus in the dark. The problem with this is that you cannot get a truly candid shot with the flash. Also, if you try to capture a moment, you may miss it, because with the flash there is a bit of a delay to adjust the focus and light.

In the daylight, the images are crisp and clean with very long focal length. In the dark (with flash) the darks are dark, which is kind of rare.

I use the camera at the 1024x768 which gives me images large enough to touch up and reduce to any size I want without losing anything.

The camera comes with a 16MB card, which is enough for about 16 photos at 1024x768, which is not enough for me. It uses type I cards, meaning you can't use the IBM superdrive, but I think that's ok. The cards are a little pricey, but if you realize that once you buy a digital camera, your expenses are finished. The rechargable battery is also fairly good, lasting about 2 hours. For a long day of shooting, I would buy a second battery and bigger card.

I am thrilled with my choice.
