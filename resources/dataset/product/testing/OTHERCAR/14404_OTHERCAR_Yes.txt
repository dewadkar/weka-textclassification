            I love this car. Let me repeat myself. I LOVE THIS CAR. 
Having been given the opportunity to ride in a Lamborghini for the first time ever this year, I fell completely in love with the to-die-for seats and the stunning color (candy-apple red). I'm a complete sucker for beautiful, expensive things - so,obviously, the moment that I opened the door I was hooked. I'm no die-hard car aficionado, but let me tell you one thing; I know a good car from a bad one, and the Lamborghini Diablo is superb.
The exterior of the car reminds me a bit of a shark. Slim but wide at the same time, the Lamborghini is the ultimate in simple yet still so amazingly compelling design. And the doors! I just adore the way that they swing UP instead of OUT (okay, okay, I know that I'm just a tad too excited. I'll calm down..:) )
On to the interior. Although things get a little cramped in the back of the car (luckily I was in the front seat), up front, there is plenty of leg room. The seating is so comfortable that I would be more than willing to sleep in one.
The ride was smooth and quiet, the engine making little or no sound whatsoever as we purred along the road. I felt none of the usual jars and bumps that passengers often experience when riding in a low-framed sports car. Every second of my ride was comfy.
Being a fan of good music, of course I had to try out the stereo system of the Lamborghini as well. Might as well make the experience complete, right? The sound quality and depth was magnificent, and the controls on the radio console were streamlined and easy to use. 
I can't wait to get one of these for myself. And I promise you, I will.<br><br>
