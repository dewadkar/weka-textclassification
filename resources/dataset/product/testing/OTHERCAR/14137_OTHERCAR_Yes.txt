            Getting tired of running out to buy film? or trying to find the time to drop off your pictures for developing? If so, then you would probably enjoy the advantages of owning a digital camera. The Fuji Finepix 1300 digital camera is by far the best camera for the price that you will pay. I purchased my camera when it first came out for $250, however, prices have come down significantly, and now you can find them for around $150-$200. 

The camera can be operated by 4 AA batteries (I would recommend rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries for this), or by a 5 volt ac adapter. 

One disadvantage to this camera is it takes a few seconds to turn it on, but once it is on, it is relatively easy to operate. You can set the camera for different size and quality pictures, the bigger and better the quality the picture is, the more amount of space it takes up. The camera comes with a 8MB memory card, and you can buy card that have more memory on them. The 8MB card can hold about 70-80 smaller pictures, and about 12 big pictures. 

When you are ready to take your picture, the camera has a nice display screen so you can see exactly what you are taking the picture of. After you take a picture, you can view it, along with any other pictures you have taken. When you are viewing them, you can zoom in and out, and move the picture around, so you can get a better view. If you don't like a particular picture then it is very simple to delete it off the camera.

This camera does have a zoom, but it is only a digital 2x zoom, and many times the picture will come out blurry when you use it, which I think it the biggest disadvantage to this camera. Though, it has many good features which make up for this. The camera has a timer, so no more of that trying to find someone to take your picture. You just set it on timer and it gives you 10 seconds. What is even better about the timer is that it will beep to warn you when the 10 seconds are almost up. It also has a setting were you can put it on continuous, meaning that it will keep taking pictures continuously. There are also a variety of different flash settings on the camera. You can set it on automatic, Flash on, Flash off, Red-Eye reduction, and synchronized flash, which in some types of lighting makes the picture look better.

When you finally take all of your pictures and are ready to upload them, you simply take the cable that comes with the camera and hook it up to your computer. You need to download the software that comes with the camera in order to upload the picture, which I found to be a little tricky, but it is relatively quick. You then turn the camera on and your pictures will pop up on your computer, were you can save them and share all the special moments you captured!
