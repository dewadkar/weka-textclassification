            My mom had to wait several months on a waiting list at her dealer to get her new Volkswagon, but she didn't seem to mind, and now she is so thrilled with her new little car!  She lets me drive it quite a bit, and I've found that it corners really well, and it's got a lot of &quot;get-up-and-go.&quot;  No problem picking up speed to get on a busy freeway, and this itty bitty car fits easily into the tight spaces, even in a crowded parking space where the folks next to you didn't leave you much room.  It gets great gas mileage too.

Even though it's a small car, I think a person up to 6'0&quot; might be able to fit in the driver's seat... and the seats scoot back quite a ways.  Also there's ample headroom in the back to keep passengers comfy, and it's not difficult to climb into the back seat, unlike some compacts.  The trunk also is pretty spacious for a small car.  When I first saw the new bugs, I thought &quot;that looks wierd!&quot;  But you know, leave it to Volkswagon to come up with a unique design that doesn't just look like every other car on the road, and they actually are kinda cute.

My Mom especially gets a kick out of all the compliments she gets on her car, and she's noticed that other people are often waving and honking at her on the road, especially people who are also driving a bug!  I guess new bug owners are being kind of like their own little club or family.  

We've only encountered 3 real drawbacks to the new VW:  you're in for a very long wait for the dealer to have a bug that you want and can buy, these bugs are rather expensive, and I don't like those round crank handles on the front seats for adjusting them to sit up or lie back.  Also, I think the knob (approx. 4+ inches diameter) would be very hard to turn for someone with small hands, arthritis, or an injured hand or wrist.

If these VW's are as durable as their predecessors, they'll keep going for another 40+ years before VW has to come up with a new version!  It's sure been fun to see how happy Mom is with her new silver &quot;baby!&quot;<br><br>
