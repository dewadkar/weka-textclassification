            Call it whatever you want.  Once you see a Chevy Siverado half ton crew cab, you will stop to to take a look at the pure brute power of this truck.  No wonder that most young guys and gals are attracted to it.  It's a truck with a tough presence on the roads.  The Ford dealers know that once for all Chevy dealers have something that can beat their bestseller, Ford 150 SuperCrew.  Chevy Silverados are made to work hard.  As far as work is concerned, I witnessed this truck's power during the recent Summer fruit harvest in the Central Valley of California.  I visited one of my farmer friends who happened to be hauling some large crates of peaches, nectarines from the fields.  <i>The 2002 Silverado 1500 Ext Cab was truly designed to meet this type of beefy challenge head on.  At the same time, it can be used as a regular work vehicle.</i>

<b>Lots of legroom, headroom and other features</b>

This brute truck, powered by a super V8 engine, can produce up to 300 horsepower at 4,400 rpm.  Towing trailers loaded with fruit was a breeze.  I did not even feel the potholes in the sandy grounds on the road to the company's headquarters in the city.  Basically, this truck gives you lots of freebies in that once it is linked to the right mode, it can tug up to 10,300 pounds.  The 1500 extended-cab can only reach 8,300-pound maximum towing.  It's the Chevy's reputation all the way!  This truck can sit 6 people comfortably, with lots of legroom and headroom.  And if you care about your cup holders, you will find them too.  In my mind, this truck is the right match for those who are working in hilly terrain and do a lot of towing.  It will serve well those who prospect for and work in oil fields.  Farmers such as my acquaintance make good use of its strength too.

<b>What to worry about:  Your Parking!!!</b>

As I mentioned above, this truck wants lots of space.  If used in the open fields, it won't pose any parking problems.  However, if you use this truck in town, then, you have to be concerned about parking this 237.3-inch-long crew cab.  For many owners, it remains a good challenge.

<b>How is the ride after all?</b>

Once you get aboard this truck, you will be taken by its spacious interior.  Sitting on the leather-clad front bucket seats, you will fall in love with its great, superb cushions.  I love these six-way, power-adjustable seats!  In fact, the rearseats are better.  And they come with their own cup holders too.  The seatbacks can also be reclined such a way to produce a nice, comfortable carpeted floor.  

If you are looking for power, durability, muscularity and improvement, Chevy Silverado has all that in the 2002 1500 Ext Cab.  You can decide to have yours in 2WD or 4WD.  It's a truck to be proud of on the road.  I highly recommend it to you!
