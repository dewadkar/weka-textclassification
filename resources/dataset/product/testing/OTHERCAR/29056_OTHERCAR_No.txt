            My first car was a 1992 Corsica LT.  I purchased it in 1995 with just under 40,000 miles.  It was still going strong when I wrecked it at 90,000 miles a few years later.

The Corsica was one good car.  At least, the V6 model was.  My wife had a 4 banger that sucked.  This car had a 3.1 V6 140 hp engine.  It wasn't the fastest car, but it had some pep.  Mine had power locks and AM/FM cassette.  That's it.  No cruise, no rear defrost, no power windows--nothing.  But it ran great.  The mileage was great--about 23 and 29.

I rarely had trouble with the car.  In the 50,000 miles I drove the car, I had to replace a few alternators, a gasket seal (under extended warranty), and a thermostat (which wasn't broken until I had the dealer flush the coolant system to get some new fluids in there).  The ABS light came on and kicked in whenever I entered a parking space.  I almost hit about 20 or so cars from that!  Still, it always started, it ran smooth and it ran quiet.

The car was rusting from the bottom up.  there was a hole in the floor runner that is exposed when you open the door.  I punched in this hole to discover that it was completely rusted underneath.  It was only a matter of time until the rust began to show through.

It handled like a typical small sedan; better than my 91 T-Bird though.  It was a relatively quiet ride.  There was no real wind noise and the interior held up well before it met the rear end of a conversion van.  The seats were comfortable and stiff.  The dashboard held up well, except for the fan knob, which came off and had to be glued on.

The speedometer went to 120 mph.  Go figure.  This 3.1 V6 Corsica had a speedometer that went 35 mph higher than my 5.0 V8 T-Bird.  I only had the Corsica up to 100 mph though.  I was too afraid of a ticket.

This car wasn't the roomiest car out there, but it was typical.  I had no problems driving it and I am 6' 4&quot;, although I might have only been 6' 3&quot; back then.  The trunk was slightly below average in size.  The back seat was unthinkable for adults.  I guess there was about as much room back there as my friend's Civic.  It was your typical compact sedan.

The Corsica is not an exciting car.  The styling, compared to today's standards, is ancient.  The 3.1 V6 is best described as adequate.  The fit and finish held up well, but the car was only 5 years old when I wrecked it.  Still, it didn't take much to wreck it.

FYI, I rear-ended a conversion van going 55 mph.  The van was going about 40 mph in the same direction.  It was dark and wet out, so my brakes were useless as I slid into it.  I wasn't hurt and neither were they.  I mashed their bumper and totaled my car.  The airbag deployed and the horn wouldn't shut off.  Serves me right for driving like an @ss.  I'm sitting there on the side of the road, embarrassed and scared as hell, and this freaking horn wouldn't shut off!  I just wanted to blend into the background but this horn kept announcing what I had foolishly done.  What I wouldn't have given for that stupid horn to just lay off!  Looking back, I can laugh at that stupid horn, but I digress...

If you are looking for a cheap used car (they quit making them in 1996), then the V6 Corsica LT is a good choice.  At 90,000 miles, mine was still rolling smooth and quiet.  This is a good first car.<br><br>
