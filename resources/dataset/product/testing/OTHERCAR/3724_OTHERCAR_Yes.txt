                     I was out looking for a  truck,and you know when you see something for the first time and you know you are in love with it,and you just have to have it?That is the felling i got when i saw the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado 1500.


         This is a good truck because it is high tech operated,and is one of the best off road trucks i have ever driven.It has 4WD so that you can go almost any were,and out here were i live in West Texas there is a lot of sand so if you don't have a 4WD you will get stuck.It has a lot of safety divices so that you are safer when you drive.If you are like me i like to feel safe when i drive.It is a very good looking truck.The thing about having a good looking truck is that you can attract alot of peoples attension.

          When you are driving the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado it is like driving a luxury car.It is smooth driving,and very comfortable.It has a  lot of power so that you can drive fast,go threw almost anything,and will help you with pretty much anything you need to do.

          If you are the kind of man or women who like to treat there truck rough it is the best on the market.It has the ability to do almost anything you will need to do with a truck.It doesn't get that good of gas mileage.So if you are a person who likes to just ride around and burn gas it is not the kind of truck you need.When you are looking for a truck take the 2000 Chevrolet into consideration.<br><br>
