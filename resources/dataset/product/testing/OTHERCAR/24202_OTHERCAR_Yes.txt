            I was searching around for a digital camera for a few months and I finally decided on the Sony DSC S30 rather than similarly priced cameras.

Reasons for buying the camera:
1.  Cool LCD screen
2.  USB port
3.  Ease of use
4.  Best zoom for the money

After using this camera at a recent wedding, I found that battery life was more than sufficient.  The zoom was real handy.  The ability to snap pictures on a whim with no worry of wasting film was great.  You can always pick and choose later.  The best thing about this camera is the ease of use.  Unlike other cameras I've tried, going through the menu was quick and easy.  Downloading the pictures into my PC using the USB port was a breeze.  The PC sees it a removal drive and behaves just like one.  You can even delete picture in the camera from the PC!!

The only thing that bothered me was the LCD screen in the reception hall.  When the light was dim, the screen would get dark to a point where it went black.  Raising the screen brightness helped.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and I would recommend this to anyone.  Oh yeah, you will have to upgrade the memory stick.  I got 32Mb.<br><br>
