            We bought this vehicle because of many reasons. One, was the affordable price. It fit into our budget at the time, so it was a deal. Another, was the roomy, spacious, luxurious inside. It has nice leather seats, with trendy patterns and a nice feel. 

I also personally liked the outer features of this car, it shows a tough and rebellious side of you, while keeping an ever so elegant appearance. The ride is perfect, smooth and in control. This car has the ability to go places that other cars can't. It has shocks that work like a charm, and wheels that are suited for mountain riding. 

I love the outer appearance of this car, and there is really nothing to hate about it. The drive of this car lets you be in control the whole time, with few problems, it is an all around good feel. 

Many different kinds of people can buy this vehicle. It doesn't take a genius to drive, and can make the stupidest person look apparently cool for however long they are in it. 

Great car for a great price,  that is all that I have to say. Good luck!<br><br>
