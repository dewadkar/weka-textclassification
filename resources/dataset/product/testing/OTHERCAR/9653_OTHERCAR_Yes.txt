            My husband and I was shopping for a new car a year after we married in 1996.  We did careful research to try and find the car we wanted . Here are a few basic things we were looking for -

we wanted a new car

we wanted a small car

we wanted a lot of space

we wanted an affordable car

we wanted a car that was good on gas

We had considered getting the Cavalier, but it really did not give us the space we wanted... then we found the neon... It had everything we wanted and more.  We bought a 1997 neon, and now we have had it for 3 and a half years... and we have not had to take it in for any repairs what so ever.. I would definately recommend this car.. If you are looking for
affordable, lots of inside room, good on gas, lots of trunk room, and reliability.<br><br>
