            This is the second Intrepid I have owned.  I had a 1995 that I traded in for my 2001.  At first, I really could not tell what the difference was in the handling and driving of each.  I have found out the blind spots on the 2001 are bigger than the 1995.  <i>(Backing into another car a week after I bought it) </i> 

<b>Interior</b>
The interior is a beige color and made much better than the 95.  The windows can be cracked if you are a smoker and it does not rain inside your car as the 95 did.  The glove compartment is much bigger and easier to get to also.  The bucket seats hug you snug and support your back.  The console is HUGE and has an extra outlet for Cell phone or CD player adapters.  The only problem I have with the console is it opens on the side instead of opening lengthwise for access to both passenger and driver.  The windshield is at such an angle you feel like you are taller than you really are.  <I> (especially if you are only 5�2� like me)</i>  I did notice the 2001 is noisier than the 1995 while driving on rough roads.

<b>Exterior</b>
Very sporty looking and sleek.  The trunk back is a bit big for my liking but the inside of the trunk makes up for that.  On the 1995 model the trunk had a problem closing at times if there was too much stuff in it.  The 2001's have hydraulic lifts so it does not take up room in the trunk.  <I>(although I am worried about those wearing out at some point)</I> The bumpers are made great.  As I mentioned before I have already tested the back bumper out and it left a sizable dent in the Honda Accord I backed into.  On the Intrepid, there is a little crease, which no one would notice unless I pointed it out.

<b>Engine and Performance</b>
I cannot say enough about the giddy up and go of this car.  I was amazed!  I have a SE 2.7 L with turbo.  Of course, I had to test out the turbo and see what this machine could do.  Going down the freeway at 60 MPH, step on the gas and I was actually pushed back into my seat and up to 85 MPH before I knew it.  I was to say the least IMPRESSED!  The only problem I see with the engine is that if you need to change the battery for any reason you had better know what you are doing.  The battery is not in its �normal� place.  It is located in a compartment in front of the tire in the right front fender and is accessible through the engine compartment.  I will just bring it in to the shop to get the battery changed if I need that.  

<b>In Closing</b>
We bought our 1995 Intrepid because the kids were turning into teens and getting taller.  We needed the room for traveling.  Now we own a 2001 Intrepid and drive rather than fly because we have more legroom than the airlines offer.
