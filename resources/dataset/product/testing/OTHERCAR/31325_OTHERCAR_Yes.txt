            Before I begin my objective review, I should probably add that I purchased this camera on ebay for around $400 (currently its MSRP is $700 or so). So, clearly for the price I paid this is a superior camera, so keep in that in mind when you make your choice (i.e. what you expect to get for your money.)

Just on a physical level this camera is very well designed. It has that matte aluminum & shiny aluminum combination which makes it an extremely attractive camera to look at. It is small also... about 1.5" x 2" x 5", or about the size of a largish bar of soap. I have fairly large hands and it fits into my hand comfortably, although my right thumb occasionally brushes over the extreme right hand side of the LCD screen which isn't a big deal. The battery cover and A/V computer output/DC input covers are well placed and not obtrusive. The memory card slides into the bottom rather neatly and the lens cover has what feels to be a spring-adjusted opening mechanism which is pretty cool. I like to just hold the camera without any batteries in it and play around with it :). Also, I haven't yet dropped the camera but it is actually covered with an aluminum casing and I read a review of another Sanyo camera which suggested it was a lot sturdier than other cameras.

The controls are very ergonomic and easy to learn. Where the right forefinger naturally rests (if you are right-handed) are the Play/Camera with LCD off/Camera with LCD on and Photo/Multi-Shot/Video/Tools switches and both are resilient enough to not be switched by accident but not "sticky" either. The right thumb rests on the "Mode" and "Set" controls which allow you to edit the resolution, quality, etc. of the media you record. The left thumb rests on a directional control pad to navigate around onscreen menus. There is also an "info" key but it is not really essential to the camera's operation and I honestly don't use it that much. Other high-end cameras that I have seen seem to have many more buttons on them, which in my opinion would be confusing. The controls on this camera are few, texturally distinct enough to learn their placement and settings quickly, and just make sense. Very elegant control of the camera.

Now, of course, performance. What I was looking for was a camera to take with me everywhere and record interesting things, in essence a photo/video/audio journal I guess. So volume of photos with reasonable quality was what I was looking for and this camera supplies that: 120 640x480 images on the included 8 mb memory card, just over 1 minute of video, about 15 minutes of audio are more than sufficient for my needs. The images are recorded in JPG or TIFF, for high-quality, the audio in WAV, and the video in Quicktime MOV which apparently is a first in digital cameras. The flash works well and the images are processed quickly allowing you to take another picture very soon which is a plus (not to mention the excellent "rapidfire" feature). Despite all this which has suited my needs perfectly, I would say the performance is the weakest part of the camera overall. The maximum resolution is 1360x1024 (1.3 megapixel I believe), which, while high, may be a little lower than what someone who is really into printing out large 8x10 photos or something. Another inescapable weakness would be that at the high resolutions and quality settings few images can be stored, but then again this camera is compatible with the IBM microdrive family of removable media storage, so for someone really looking for that, it is available. One final counterpoint is that there is only a 2x zoom, but this camera is once again compatible with a product that will correct that, so upgradeability is present. Battery life for the camera is about 15 minutes or so of LCD time or hours and hours of non-LCD time. Since it includes an extra set of batteries, I've had no problems with this, just recharge them overnight and it's ready for a day of photography.

I can't say if the included software is great, bad, or whatever having only used it (I mean the TWAIN driver and upload/download program) and no comparable software but it certainly gets the job done. Pictures take very little time to put on my computer from the camera (this is a hardware feature with your computer though, so performance may vary) and it is easy to save them, delete them, etc. I haven't used the included photo editing software because I use Photoshop, but I expect it will suffice, anyone really needing something more is likely to already have it. Hope this review helps you enter or delve deeper into the exciting realm of digital photography and video :).
