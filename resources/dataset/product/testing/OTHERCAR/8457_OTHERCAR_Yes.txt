            i just recently acquired this device and i think it's the bomb-diggy. i'm impressed. it takes excellent shots and performs quite well in low light conditions while capturing at a pretty fast rate. however, the design/usability factor is not so hot.

although it's nice that the lens body collapses and makes the camera much more compact, it takes a while to extend when you turn the camera on. it sucks that you have to wait til the thing fully expands. also, unless you use the CA-1 conversion lens adapter, the lens body, as extended, is one heck of a fragile thing to be exposed. it also sucks that you have to remember to remove the lens cap or else the lens body will not be able to extend when you turn the thing on. i've already done this once and luckily, i didn't ruin the extending lens. as a safeguard, you can get the conversion lens adapter. the adapter serves as a rigid housing for the extending lens and though it adds to the overall camera dimension, the lens is fully protected (when you put a UV filter on the adapter, that is). also, i hope to find a lens cap that will fit the adapter.

what also sucks is the color LCD viewfinder. it is another exposed and vulnerable surface that can easily get scratched or scuffed. so be careful with that. also, the many different image format/compression options are awesome, though all the settings reset if you take the battery out.

apart from these flaws, the camera is great and captures very good images with minimal fuss. just check out the images on my website and find out.<br><br>
