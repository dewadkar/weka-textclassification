            I ordered my 1995 Chevrolet Silverado when I was living in Japan.  This was my dream truck as a kid and it was to be my first new vehicle.  I've had many more vehicles before then, but Epinions doesn't ask for opinions on the 1975 Buick Electra 225.  I don't understand that.

When I ordered my truck I did so without checking any literature.  I ordered it with 5.0L (305 c.i.) V8.  When matched with the 5-speed manual transmission, it had ample pulling power for what I needed.  I also got the sliding rear glass.  That's was really all the options I could afford at the time.

Also, I couldn't see putting in a bunch of factory options when I planned on putting on even more after-market options.

When I picked up my truck in AZ, it was the first time I found out that they had changed the interior of the this model year.  Man, what an improvement.  Compared to the '94 model, this thing should have been wearing a Cadillac badge.

It seemed like Chevrolet really did their homework for this model year.  Of course, they have their good years, and their really bad years.  The gauges were much easier to read and the seats were a lot more comfy.

The whole interior was just more aesthetically pleasing all round, while the exterior, for the most part, stayed the same.  Personally, I think this was the best year for the C/K because you had the latest interior and you didn't have the second airbag.

Now, I agree that airbags are important (used a couple myself), but it seems to me that GM engineers were all sitting in a circle smoking pot (much like That '70s Show) and someone said, &quot;Hey, I got an idea we'll just put a plastic box where the cup holders are.&quot;  Then they all got the munchies and never came up with a better idea.

One thing that really upsets me about my truck though is that it is GM red.  For those of you who've never owned a GM red car you wouldn't notice that to save money, GM adds orange to it.  Therefore your car, after years of exposure to the elements, will look more orange especially when parked next to other red cars.  Fortunately, I have waxed mine every 3 months so it's a little better that other GM's.<br><br>
