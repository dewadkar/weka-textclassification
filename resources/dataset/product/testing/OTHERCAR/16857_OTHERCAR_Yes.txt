            Wow, WHAT CLASS....  A Digital Camera that not only take photographs but can also take 5,10 or 15 seconds (A full minute if you keep the shutter button depressed) of moving images (mpeg movies) complete with audio.

I booked this camera out of work for the week and read the instructions for about 15 minutes.  The instructions were clear, informative and complete with mini pictures to help you get to grips with the many features this digital camera has to offer.

I found the Sony MVC-FD90 easy to use and took brilliant quality pictures and excellent mpeg moving pictures.

I wanted to give an epinion that 'captures' (Joke - Get IT) the true value of this Digital Camera.  Having read other epinions, some of them (NOT ALL) seemed to lack any substance about exactly what this camera was truly capable of....

How do I describe the Sony MVC-FD90's impressive list of features and functions without sounding like a tech nerd..... Here goes.....


1.  This camera will save the day as far as the 'floppy disk' is concerned. This camera has a 4x, (4 speed - Will help save the recorded image quickly) 3.5&quot; Floppy Drive. You can go buy yourself a 3 or 4 boxes of 10 disks that will cost you less than 2/3 rolls of film and you can reuse your disks time and time again unlike ordinary films. (The same floppy disks as you use in your home computer).  

I was able to save on 1 disk in '1280x848 (3:2) image mode' 6 pictures complete with the same 6 images in  e-mail format of '320x240'. 

The e-mail images are great for sending as attachments.  They are small in size (approximately 12.5k). 

By my reckoning, 1 box of 10 disks will record 60 digital images in 1280x848 (3:2).  

Another useful feature of using the floppy drive is that Sony has a Memory Stick (8 / 16 / 32 and 64 Mb capacity) that you insert into a 3.5 Floppy Disk Adapter that will allow you to store 26 / 53 / 108 and 218 images respectively at 1280x848 (3:2).

You also have the ability to format disks and copy certain images from one disk to another.  (I will add that I had a problem formatting unformatted disks - the camera gave me a disk error, re-formatting pre-formatted disks posed no problems.)

2.  You can add a print mark to the images that you have taken and get them printed at any photographic shop that conforms to the DPOF (Digital Print Order Format)...  Just take the disks into the shop.

3.  When you have recorded an image you can then Digitally Zoom in on part of the image (In my test 5x was the highest Digital Zoom-in).  You can zoom in a particular part of the image and then trim / resize the image, or just trim an image to get rid of want you don't want.  

4.  There are 4 image effects that you can use.
    
    Solarize - Very nice illustration effect... Inspiring 
    B&amp;W      - A monochrome effect... Well...It's Black and White
    Sepia    - Make a modern image look like an old photograph... Nice
    Neg Art  - Negative effect.... looks like a film negative... Funny 

5.  Date Stamp.... Most modern camera's have this facility, so it's nothing special.  It can impose the Time and/or Date onto an image.

6.  You can view the images one at a time or view them 6 at a time with a scroll bar to scroll through them.

7.  All the images are displayed on a 2.5&quot; Solar Colour LCD screen.  So you can see what your getting before you record the image.  No more missing heads or feet.

8.  The Sony MVC-FD90 claims a 1.6 Mega Pixel Image (Interpolated) at it's maximum 1472x1104 Image Size.  They say the Higher the Pixels the better the image.

9.  One of my favourite features is the mpeg movie function.  You can as I said above record 5, 10 or 15 seconds of mpeg standard home movie's and if you keep the shutter button depressed a whole minute of mpeg movie, complete with AUDIO....

The possibilities are endless.... The first step.... The first fall....The first words.... Quick Message for the e-mail.... Saying 'I love you' to a loved one.... etc etc etc.

10. The menu facilities on the camera are all accessed by means of a joystick type flat button that will help you scroll through the options and then enter sub menu's and select exactly what you want.  Sounds very complicated BUT it isn't.  It's child's play as long as you read the instructions.

11. You can also output the images by directly connecting the camera to your TV (Lead Supplied)

12. You can alter Sharpness, White Balance, Flash Level and Exposure for the camera enthusiast.

13. This camera comes equipped with an InfoLITHIUM battery.  This gave me 100 minutes of use per charge and was displayed on the LCD screen so I knew exactly what charge I had left.  The use of Zoom / Format / Frequent Turning Off / On did shorten the charge to about 60 minutes of use.  Still not Bad.

14. Self-Timer, Great for taking snaps of yourself with the family and gives you 10 seconds to get in the frame.

There are many features that I have not gone into here, but they will keep you busy mastering all the functions.  

It's a fantastic camera and I am now rapidly saving so I may purchase one for myself and my family.

All-in-All, a MUST for the person who has everything and a compulsive snapper.  It's great fun. Loads of Features and Gadgets. Easy to use. Very clear instructions. I WANT ONE......

Get yourself to the nearest Sony Store or Camera Shop and BUY one today......  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.... I GUARANTEE IT.....
