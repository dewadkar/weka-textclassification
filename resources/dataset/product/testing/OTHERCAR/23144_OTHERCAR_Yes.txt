            In 2001, I began my search for a third vehicle. The two cars my wife and I owned became "hers" and "ours", but there was no "mine." I set out to find an inexpensive car that I could customize a bit to make it "mine" -- something with a convertible top and decent gas mileage would be nice, but unfortunately I only had about $4000 to spend.

The solution to my problem appeared in the form of a 1995 Geo Tracker. After driving the little thing I fell in love with it, and $3995 later, I had myself a fun little vehicle.

At first, I was a bit leary of its mileage. At 120,000 miles, I wondered how much life was left in this little vehicle. A quick ride around the block eased those fears. While it's not going to impress anyone at the drag strip, the Tracker I drove was as spunky and full of life as ever.

I have since spent a lot of money on this car, but before you freak out, it's all been upgrades. As far as maintenance goes, the only money I've spent has been on oil changes, and I'm currently at 135,000 miles. A few of the things I have purchased for my Tracker include a hardtop (to replace the ragtop), aftermarket tail lights, headlight covers, aftermarket wheels and tires, and an award winning stereo system.

Those looking for speed and horsepower should probably look elsewhere. My manual five-speed provides just enough speed to not get run over leaving stop lights or while cruising on the interstate, but not much more. At stop lights, I take off in first, shift into second midway through the intersection, and go into third just after leaving the intersection. First gear must really be geared for towing, as I routinely leave my Tracker in second when pulling up to stop signs. On the interstate, my boxy beauty has no problem burying the speedometer needle, but seeing as though it only goes up to 85mph, its chances of breaking the sound barrier are pretty slim. What the Tracker does provide, however, is enough gusto to go anywhere you want to go.

Besides, looking at the profile of a Geo Tracker doesn't say "fast," it shouts "FUN!" And fun it is. I've lowered mine slightly and put some low profile tires on mine to get rid of that "towering" feeling, but even before that it was a blast to drive. Whatever fun it lacks in "top speed thrills" it surely makes up for in the summertime, with the top down and the radio cranked up.

People often ask me about the safety of these vehicles. I honestly think that people who roll these cars over are either not driving very safely, or are driving places they shouldn't be. I am quite sure I could roll my Tracker over; that being said, I'm sure my other two cars would roll over just as easily. Again, you have to question yourself, why are you buying this vehicle? If it's to turn into a police pursuit vehicle or an off-road mudding monster, maybe think again. If you're looking for something cute, attractive, affordable, reliable, economical and (again) fun, then you're barking up the right tree.

The interior of the Tracker is user friendly and accessable -- however, it's pretty small. My Tracker is now a two seater, and while my wife and I (both large people) have no problem cruising around in my Tracker, the back seat definitely left room to be desired. The front seats, when slid all the way back, basically touch the front of the rear seat. Plenty of room for two, but awful cozy for four adults. While okay if just skipping across town (or with the top down), I wouldn't want to plan a cross-country (or state) roadtrip with four adults -- besides, where would you put everyone's luggage??

I like the sharp lines on the exterior of the mid 90's trackers, before they got so ... round. The crease around the rear quarter panel really sets the car off. The outside metal is pretty thin, so expect Trackers more than a couple of years old to have their share of door dings, but that thin metal is pretty easy to have repaired as well. There are lots of aftermarket add-ons available for Trackers, including ground effects, head/tail lights, tops, interiors, and more. The tires are a common 5 bolt pattern which my local wheel/tire store had no problem fitting.

Geo's 1.6 liter engine is comparable with the Honda Civic's, so that's about what to expect. People complaining about the lack of towing power or speed off the line are trying to make the Tracker into something it's not.

"Road noise" gets mentioned a lot when talking about these cars, and it's true, these things get pretty loud at highway speeds. One problem is the doors don't latch at the top, only the sides, eventually causing windy (and squeaky) doors. The aftermarket hardtop ($600, eBay) I installed made quite a bit of difference, but it's still no Lexus. 

All in all, I love my 8 year old Geo Tracker, and it looks like she still has many years left in her.
