            This is not my first Cadillac however, this vehicle was a disappointment.
Although I am pleased with the ability of the car to handle well in traffic and on the open road, I find that there have been too many visits to the service dept.. As wonderful as this dealer's shop has been for over 10 years, this car has been a challenge. The headlights have fogged up repeatedly and been replaced, the locks have not functioned properly and they too have been repaired/replaced. At a little over 30,000 miles this is the third set of brakes and the warning light flickered today. The beverage holder has broken, the trim has popped loose, the stereo needed to be repaired/replaced and the list goes on. Could this be problems to be expected in the first model year?  I would expect more from America's Premier Auto Maker.
