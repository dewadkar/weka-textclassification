            We took our first road trip this weekend.  We had not only the trailer and the bed filled but the cab has so much room.  Whether you are packing an extra person or cargo, you are sure to fit it all in this bad boy.  I thought my 1996 Mazda B4000 had plenty of power even while pulling a trailer through the mountains.  
My husband loves the fact that he doesn't have to get out of the truck to switch over to 4X4.  Just push in the clutch and flip a switch.
My only disappointment in purchasing the vehicle is that I did not want a Ford.  And I didn't realize how close the interior was until we pulled up next to a fullsize Ford truck. When we looked at, it we saw that it had the exact same dash.  I then went and compared it to my father's Ford Ranger.  There is so many things that were identical I thought I was going to be sick.  My dad even went and bought my husband a Ford key chain because they are so close.  Now we say that we bought not a Ford but a foriegn Ford.
