            Well, if you're of the epinion that the former is true, then please, by all means send me the title to your under-appreciated asset - I'll take care of any misgivings you may have about (TRULY) the most significant car of this century.  While pangs of nostalgia beckon me to a simpler architecture, the launch of the new 911 has revealed a tremendously appealing version of my lifelong friend.  My enthusiasm has not waned even with the move to a new water-cooled powerplant and active suspension enhancements designed to make the oversteering days of yesteryear a thing of the past.

No! I say to the silky smooth driveline and predictable handling - take me back to the 84-88 911s - at this point in our story we have quite a few engineering triumphs to report for the breed - galvanized body, 3.2 litre engine (with the carrera tensioners - available as an update on pre-84 models), the classic styling of the ageless body but with the exterior and interior amenities which were previously lacking.  Yes, these are the finest years in my opinion.

Overall, the 911s of this era are extremely reliable - check out any classified ad site to find most of these cars are well into the 100's of thousands of miles and still running strong.  With reasonably well delivered service of the horizontally-opposed flat-6 dry sump motor (oil changes will require 10 quarts of oil) including valve jobs every 30K miles or so, you'll be smiling from ear to ear in amongst a gaggle of giddy gawkers.  It's a devilishly good looking automobile with an unequivocal (and well deserved) distinction as a true &quot;Driver's Car&quot;.

And even better than the reliability of the motor you ask?  The resale value, my friend!  Look again at the classified ad sites to find 20 year old 911s fetching from the mid-teens to approaching $20K!  A justifiable investment (you might offer your life partner this angle when they ask you if you are nuts).   

Downsides include the lack of adequate financing available (try asking the bank for 20 grand for a 20-year old car), insurance costs, and well, it's hard to park it at the Walmart next to the 4x4 chevy truck and expect it to remain unmolested - (so get a commuter car).

I can say that my epinion is simply that the 911 represents the greatest motoring achievement in all of human history, and if you've got the chance just once in your life - GET ONE!
