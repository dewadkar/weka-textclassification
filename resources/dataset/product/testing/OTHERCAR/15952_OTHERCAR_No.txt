            So you think that you want to buy a digital camera.  Well have I got news for you.  These things are not at all as easy as they look.  I thought that all I would have to do is buy one of these cameras and take some pictures and in a dew minutes I would have pictures to send everyone through email.  That is not at all the case.

I went out and bought myself a nice digital camera that was not a lot of money but yet cost a pretty good penny.  When I got home I sat down and read the manual that was only about four hundred pages long and only took me all day to read.  Then I thought that I had it but this was only the start.  Once I took a picture which only took me about an hour to figure out how to do I tried to down load it to my computer.  This was one of the hardest things I have ever tried to do which is probably because I am not too good on the computer any ways.  After awhile I finally figured it all out.

I think that this probably is one of the best digital cameras because it has a great picture that comes out and is very clear.  I guess that I made a good choice when I bought this camera for my needs but feel that I should have just kept my money.

If I had to tell a friend if they should  buy a digital camera I think I would have to have them over and try to use mine and see if they would be able to handle one.<br><br>
