            Having had the misfortune to rent a brand new Grand Vitara (it had less than 100 miles on the odometer) for a few days, I'm not an expert.  But I can tell you: from my experience, I can't believe they're charging people money to buy and drive this thing.  Not that it broke down on me or anything like that-- it's just that I hated, *hated*, driving it.

There was no pickup at all-- which was odd, considering it was a V6.  The acceleration was poor, jerky, and loud.  The automatic transmission shifted competently, but it made the apparent lack of acceleration power even more obvious.  Braking was sluggish and mushy;  braking power was nonexistent.  I'd hate to drive it on a wet road.  Handling was terrible:    changing lanes was an exercise in body roll, and the steering was imprecise.  The interior was loud and uncomfortable;  the overall width and seats were all surprisingly narrow.

In all, it handled like a garbage truck:  loud, uncomfortable, and clumsy.

Now, these are just my opinions from a few days' rental, but let me at least advise you, if you're considering this SUV:  test drive it at length, and compare to other SUVs in this class before you make a final decision.  Don't assume that this is as good as it gets!
