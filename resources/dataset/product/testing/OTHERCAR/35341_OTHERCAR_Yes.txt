            Recently I had a minivan adVenture. Chevrolet has been my vehicle of choice for many years. Chevrolet sent me $40 to test drive one of their new vehicles. But today I am driving a 1996 Chrysler Town and Country.
   The town and country, although used, outperformed and out classed the chevy Venture. Although I realize a new t&amp;c is slightly higher then a venture the one I purchased was in the mid range when new. The t&amp;C rides smoother, handles better, is extremely more comfortable and much more luxurious then the Venture.
  The minivan adVenture started of course on the local Chevy lot. And keep in mind that I have driven Chevys for years. The Venture was a superb vehicle in comparison with our Astro van. I was impressed in many ways with the prgress GM had made in minivans. The Venture the Salesman steered me to was the top of the line model. It had everything imagineable in a quality minivan. Right down to stereo hookups and video game hookups in the back for the kids. But the Back. This is where the problems begin. The seats are too low. They would be fine for families with small children but mine are teenagers and the seating is not comfortable for older children and adults. enough said about the chevy.
  On to our local Saturn Dealership which is worth another review at another time. !996 T&amp;C. I now know why Chrysler-Plymouth_ Dodge has cornered the minivan market so long. They are the ruler and the yardstick. They are the original on everything you can think of to get on your new minivan and the best at it.Everything that was &quot;new&quot; on the 2000 Venture was already on the T&amp;C and like I said even after 4 years it was a much solider vehicle and a much greater value. It out manuevered out handled out rode out luxuried the Chevy Venture by miles. My wife had her heart set on a new Venture today she or I would either trade our used Chrysler Town &amp; Country for a whole fleet of new Ventures.<br><br>
