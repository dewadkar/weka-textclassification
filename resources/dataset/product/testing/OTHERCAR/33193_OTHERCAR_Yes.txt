            I purchased my 1993 Concorde as a second owner. The car is very comfortable and roomy. Mine has power seats, both driver and passenger sides. I live in Michigan so the car sees a lot of snow. The front wheel
drive has traction control which is similar to posi-traction. The ABS
braking system works flawlessly, I can't make the car skid while stopping.
The instrumentation includes electronic compass, fuel economy sensor
trip odometer, and even a miles remaining to destination feature.

Another nice feature is the climate control, the system actually works
like a thermostat in your home. The Infinity sound system is superior to our in home system. 

Even with all the comfort and full size, this car gives me 25 mpg on the freeway, and 17 mpg stop and go. My Concorde has 90,000 miles, uses zero oil, the leather interior still looks great, and the car will start in the coldest weather. 


The one thing I had to replace was both Motor Mounts. This cost $150.00 in parts. The labor I furnished. <br><br>
