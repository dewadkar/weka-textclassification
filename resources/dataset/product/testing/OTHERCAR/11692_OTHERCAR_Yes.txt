            I bought this truck ~3 years ago with the intent of using it off-road and, mainly, as my daily driver.  On-road it rides and handles like a truck.  Some people seem to think it is tippy around the corners, but it seems fine to me.  The seats are generally comfortable, and you have a comanding view of the road ahead.  The car is very open with lots of windows making it bigger than it seems.  The windshield is a bit short, so I often have to tilt my head to see tall traffic lights.  Head room is supurb as is foot and hip room.  Everything is well placed with the exception of the under seat CD changer and the window controls which seem to be reversed.   The jump seats in the back are usefull and can hold 6 footers with some comfort, but the truck feels really slow with 7 people in it.  Cargo room is also really good too especially with the back seats folded down.  Certainly the Discovery is a daily driver, if you don't drive it like a sports car.  But it is sort of costly to maintain.  I just passed 61000 miles (bought it with 42000), and have had the following parts replaced:
-gas tank and hose for leakage-$600
-something in the steering box for squeky steering-$200
-miscellaneous hoses for leakage-$100
-clutch master cylinder-$300
-brake rotors and pads-$300
-front CV joint-$250
-60000 mile service-$600
Now for the good stuff...off-road, one word can describe it...AWESOME!  With a super strong frame, solid axles, and a flexy suspension it will go just about anywhere you want it to.  It has a 3.27:1 low range which will pretty much dominate any hill you want it to.  The center diff lock is very useful too.  The narrow body and short wheelbase make it an easy car to navigate on narrow trails.  I have been on level 4 and above trails with close to no problems.  The main problem I have off-road is ground clearance, it rubs on the frame a lot.  But a lot of the parts down there are tucked in.  But lifting the vehicle would take care of this.  A word of caution, the stock axle shafts and driveshafts can't take much abuse once you push it hard off-road, so if you fit more than a 32" tire and/or take it off-road (stock is 29")...it would be wise to upgrade.  The aftermarket support on Discovery's is growing year by year, I have listed a few very reputable ones below.

A good and bad thing about all the Discovery's is that they all look the same a 1994 Discovery and a year 1999 model look almost exactly the same.  Also, they depreciate like non other.  My Disco was bought for almost $20000 ~3 years ago, now it's worth $10000.  A year 2000 Discovery 2 in good condition can be yours for $25000 or less.  This could be a good thing...it looks like you're driving a $40000 vehicle, but it can also be bad.
