            Oh, to be sixteen again.  Alright, maybe I don�t necessarily want that, but it was a fun, fun time.  Of course, growing up in a small Connecticut town, there was fun to be had, just not in the immediate vicinity.  I suppose it was an enviable position for some:  experience all four seasons, the beach is a daytrip away in the summer.  The mountains?  The best skiing in the East was a similar trip to the North.  But regardless of where I was going, my Nissan Sentra equaled freedom.

This review is in memory of Rodiem, a much loved and never-to-be-forgotten member of our community.  Although I couldn�t relate to his technical acumen of automobiles, I certainly can appreciate his warm, kind-heartedness, and my prayers are with his loved ones.

Some people buy particular cars for performance, some for looks, some for price.  It�s funny, however, that it always seems that you can tell a lot about someone by the car they drive.  I think the same is true for me: the Sentra is low maintenance, economical, and isn�t flashy, but gets the job done.  So I mentioned my absence of automobile knowledge.  When the blue stuff (windshield wiper fluid) gets low, you put more in.  That is about the extent of my automotive intellect.

<b>The Specs</b>
So I should give some specs, and please forgive my ignorance.  I had the 2-door, �88 variety.  Grey in color, the best part about her was her tremendously efficient gas mileage.  I could fill it up for about 12 bucks, and she�d run true for a week or more (I realize that this is not accurate as far as mpg goes, I apologize.  The gist is, it was good on gas).  I�d say I got 25 mpg or so.  Standard shift, front wheel drive, it was the perfect economy car.

<b>Service</b>
Service was also a breeze, mostly.  Like I said, she was an �88, so when I took her over she only had about 5,000 miles on her, and was about 3 years old- pretty new.  She ran like a charm for years, but when she approached 100,000 miles, she got a little cranky, which I could more than expect, I could empathize.  When I finally let her go, she still had her original clutch, shocks, transmission, and the like.  I did replace the brakes and exhaust.

Like I said, the Sentra was my very first car.  I went on my first date in it, countless fun nights with friends, headed off to college in it, and I loaded it up when I moved on to my first apartment, first job.  Sadly enough, the day came when I had to say goodbye.  I still miss her to this day, and I have yet to replace her.  Some of the best memories of my life are with that car.  It was with me through good times, rough times, but the important part is: it was always there, and I will always remember her.
