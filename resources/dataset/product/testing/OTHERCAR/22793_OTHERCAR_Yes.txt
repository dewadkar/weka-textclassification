            I figured seeings I was the owner of a 1999 Hyundai Accent I would write a little review of the car.  I owned the car for 6 months and was really pleased with it's overall performance and reliability during the time I had it.  It was my first vehicle and was the only vehicle that was reasonably new that was in my price range at the time.  I payed $8500 for a vehicle with 21000kms, so I payed a bit more for a vehicle that really had only had 4 oil changes.  I figured I would get a vehicle that would last me a couple years and that I wouldn't run into any major problems with it due to the low kms.

I mention that I was an owner because I had my car written off last month in a high speed accident.  I ended up t-boning a car that pulled out from a stop sign while I had the right of way.  I had little time to react and ended up hitting the car at about 70km/h.  The airbag deployed perfectly and I came out of the crash without a scratch.  The whole front end crumpled and left the drivers compartment intact, though the centre panel did pop back a bit.  So safe to say when I needed to replace the car I again looked at another Hyundai Accent and subsequently bought a 2001 Accent GSI model.

As you can tell it was pretty barebones model, but for the price and ridiculously low kilometers it made for a great first car.  The only major issues I had with the car was the interior space.  I am a lanky 6'2" guy with long legs, so I found the leg room was a bit of an issue.  I found that the foot rest on the left was a bit too big and cut into my legroom.  I normally had to tilt the seat back slightly to have a comfortable position with which to drive in.  Also the seats were a tad high, making it a little confined though I learned to deal within it.  If I spiked my hair it would touch the room, so there was little working room there.  It has the same amount of headroom as a Toyota Tercel, though the seats sit higher in the Accent.  It wasn't uncomfortable, but made things a bit tight at times.  Aside from myself, the size of the interior was adequate with passengers in the vehicle and was comfortable even when sitting in the back for someone of my height.  I found that this vehicle seemed to have more rear legroom then my friends Toyota Corolla

The standard transmission was my first experience driving manual, so I had to learn with it.  I found the shifting to be smooth and allowed alot of forgiveness with the clutch and not being perfectly timed with your shifting, which was handy for a learner like myself.  I've driven a couple of standards since and noticed that the stroke of the shifting is alot longer then in other standard vehicles, but when you do change gears you know what gear it is going into for sure.

I found that the fuel economy with quite good for the vehicle and was always a cheap fill.  I work close to home, so a tank of gas could often last 2 weeks with an average amount of driving into town and whatnot.  In 6 months I put on 9000kms, so I didn't drive the car a tonne.

One thing I liked was the centre console.  It was well layed out with a big button for the 4 way flashers for easy access, unlike alot of vehicles I've driven.

The rear seat folds down and gives you plenty of room should you need to transport things.  I fit a decent sized christmas tree in there no problem.
