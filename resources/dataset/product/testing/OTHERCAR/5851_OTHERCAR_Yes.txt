            The 2001 Seville is a stunningly handsome car. Although the design dates back to 1998 the exterior proportions are timeless.  Seventeen inch wheels are a worthy option giving the car a strong visual stance lacking on the sixteen inch wheel equipped Seville.  They also contribute to improved handling (a trait not appreciated by auto magazine reviewers who have tested previous model year Sevilles).  The 300 horsepower V-8 is as good as any high tech engine and the performance algorythm transmission is fun when driving the car aggressively.  It automatically holds the car in lower gears when the computer senses high g-forces (very fast turns).  The vehicle performance is sufficient to frustrate the ego's of most European luxury car drivers in stoplight challenges.  The Seville's trump card though is it's foul weather performance.  Front wheel drive, traction control, and stability control combine to make the car amazingly well poised in any weather.  Snow will never deter you.  
Inside the car you will appreciate the heated leather seats (front&rear) with individual driver, passenger and rear seat climate controls.  THE SCENT OF LEATHER- Never have I experienced a scent so wonderful in a leather trimmed car. Very nice. The Seville also has a feature that recognizes your key (and your spouses) and automatically sets your seat, mirrors, temperature controls, steering wheel, and radio presets to your preferences when you enter the car.  My only complaint was the time it took to set all these functions.  The quality of the wood and leather inside is first rate.  My only gripe with the interior is the use of a zipper on the top of the rear seat back which is visible through the rear view mirror.  The Seville has so many nice features I tend to forget some of them.  
Overall I am very pleased with this car and would recommend it highly.
