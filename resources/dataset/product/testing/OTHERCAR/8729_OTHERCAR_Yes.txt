            Two days ago, I purchased the Epson PhotoPC 850z Digital 2.1 Mega Pixel camera.  It includes an 8meg memory card which allows you to save or delete the pictures you have taken.  It also has a nice 1.5&quot;-2&quot; LCD that shows you the image you are about to capture.  

With this camera, I can take pictures and upload it to my computer, and print some nice high quality pictures.  I like to list auctions on ebay and yahoo every now and then, and with this camera, I can take some photos and place those photos along with the item description.  That is the main reason why I purchased this camera. 

I used to have to take pictures with my other camera, then run down to the 1 hour photo develop center.  I would spend around $10 to develop not knowing if the pictures turned out exactly the way I want them to.  With the Epson 850z, I can take the pictures and delete them if I didn't want them.  That is the great thing about this camera.  It saves time, money, and film.  Oh wait, the Epson 850z doesn't use film.  This Epson uses a 8mb memory card.  That will save you a ton of money from purchasing film.

I don't really know much about Digital cameras but I can tell you that the Epson 850z is one great camera.  <br><br>
