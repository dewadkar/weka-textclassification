            A four door sedan for under $3000. I needed a car since the tranny on my truck had eventually died. I looked around endlessly for a week. As I drove home I remembered about a small used car dealership, pretty much high mileage/low cost. As I passed the lot, I saw a black car sitting on the side of the road with a tag saying $2500. I pulled over and my girlfriend and i looked at the car. The interior was nice and clean, the bucket seats were firm but comfortable. Mileage was low also, only 120000 for a 1992 car. I looked underneath the hood, the engine was clean, nothing out of place, everything stock. 

I cranked the engine, no problems at all. No noises, no fumes, so i thought it safe to take for a test drive. The power shoulder belt was a awesome convenience, no more tickets for no seatbelt!. As i was out on the road driving, the suspension was smooth, it was a little like driving a minivan at first, but then i gave the engine a little gas. 

Now the engine in this car is the VG30E, the same as those used in the earlier Z cars. 3.0l V6, 160hp, 190ftlbs, SOHC. The horsepower for the car seems low, but for a car of this age, its actually a decent amount. It has a lot of available power, the transmission is good, but the Nissan automatic transmission needs a lot of work. However, with the available power/comfort switch that changes shift points, and a manual overdrive off switch, the car will get you up to speed quickly. If you can find a manual SE maxima, I strongly suggest you buy it. 

Never having bought a Nissan, or drove one, I was hesitant of the car. Since conquering my fears, I am glad I have done so. The Car now has close to 135000 since June at 120000. The only problem I have encountered is the anti-theft system. It activated the night that I bought the car, but has not since done so. I have made several trips of 200+ miles at a time, and the car has not had a problem, it drives like new.

For those of you who enjoy car modifying, and are on a low budjet, this is a great car. There are plenty of products available for the car from styling to performance. I am currently working on such mod's. 

Now to the interior,
The drivers and passenger seats in my GXE are powered, this was not standard on all GXE's. Mine was bought with an option package qhich gave the car powered seats, keypad entry system, Sunroof, Bose audio system, and Automatic Climate Control. These were all things I was not used to, it also comes standard with power windows, power locks, Cruise control, powered and heated mirrors, intermittent wipers, corner lights, remote trunk release, 4 spd auto with Power/comfort switch and overdrive, and a few other things. Plenty to keep you entertained. 

Suspension and Brakes,
The stock suspension is bulky, however it provides a comfortable grip on the road. Suspension mods are available from several sources. The brakes in the GXE are from disc with 12" rotors, and rear drums. The SE comes with stiffer suspension and discs all round. 

The difference between the GXE and SE are;

GXE
Chrome door sills, Chrome Grille, body colored mirrors and bumpers. All models come with 160hp VG30e.

SE
Available in 5spd, Black Mirrors, door sills, body colored grille and black accented bumpers, Rear Spoiler.
89-91 Models with VG30e, 92-94 with VE30DE, 190hp
