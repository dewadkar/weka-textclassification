            I think the new Golf is well designed but the engine is powerful, but a bit noisy.  With this price, I say it is a very good buy.  I also tried Audi A3, which shares the same platform and engine.  But what I love most about the new Golf is speedometer that lights blue.  These meters are very cool!  The Golf had a little more room, and had more features like easily foldable back seat, etc., and Audi is a lot more expensive.  <br><br>
