            The Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera is everything you want...and maybe more than you want!   It has many hot features including a great live display on both the back of the camera and in the viewfinder, swivel body, built in flash, macro capability, digital and optical zoom, and a 2+ megapixel resolution capability.  You pay dearly for this last feature as many 1.3 megapixel cameras are now under $300, street price.   If you really intend to print a lot of 5x7's and 8x10's from your digital photos, this is the camera.  If not, you are buying more than you need.

I bought the Coolpix 900 when it hit the street about 18 months ago, thinking I would take every shot in the FINE (1.3 megapixel) mode.  I quickly learned that at over 500 K per shot, my smart media card and computer hard disk filled up quickly.  I soon found myself shooting most shots in NORMAL mode at about half the resolution.  Great for screen displays, not a memory hog.  I now find the same on the Coolpix 950 as well, but I like the potential to take detailed printable shots whenever I choose.

A couple of things that bug me about both the 900 and 950:  First, there is a noticeable delay from depressing the shutter to the picture being taken (I have many photos of only the rear end of race cars and the like!) Also, the camera tends to go to sleep at just the wrong moment, so a habit must be formed of regularly depressing the shutter half way every few seconds to ensure that the camera is ready when you are.

Both of these bugs clearly apply to action photography more than stiil, and in the overall scope of things, can be endured for the opportunity to own a use such great machine!<br><br>
