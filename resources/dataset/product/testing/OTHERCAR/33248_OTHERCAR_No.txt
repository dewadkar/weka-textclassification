            I'm a 30 year professional and a General member of ASMP. I specialize in Architecture and Interiors. I bought a new E-10 as an entry for our studio into the digital realm as far as shooting goes. I was very attracted to the 4MP usable resolution and the described excellence of the lens.

Regretably, I have had to return the E-10 after our first attempt to use it to shoot some room interiors as a test. The lens (in this particular camera) proved to be only sharp in the center portions of the field of view at wide angle zoom at an aperture of f8. The lens &quot;fall-off&quot; at the perimeter was so bad as to render the camera unusable for our purposes.

I hope we just had a bad example and all are not like this, but I'm now leery of the optics and we are still looking for a contender with that resolution and price...with good optics!!
