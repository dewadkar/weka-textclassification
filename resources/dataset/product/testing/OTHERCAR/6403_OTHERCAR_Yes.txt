            Had to give up my 2-door manual transmission Celica GTS since the stick shift was too bestial for my wife and the back seats didn't transport friends well.  Determined that if I got an automatic 4-door sedan, it was going to be sporty, and I mean a car with some horses, torque, and tight handling. But oh, I also wanted this in a recent model year that was reasonably priced, which meant the Beemers, 'Cedes, and Saabs of the world couldn't stick around.  After preliminary research, thought for sure I was going to get a '97-'99 Maxima SE, or at the very least an Asian import.  So imagine my surprise when the '99 Olds Intrigue GL kept coming up in my research as a car that received strong reviews, was modestly priced, and that, on paper, met all of my particular requirements.  And wow did it look sleek, which also surprised me, since I had equated Olds autos with a &quot;stodgy&quot; appearance.  Had test driven a '99 Maxima SE Limited, and loved the power and handling, but disappointed that it didn't have ABS as a standard feature, and that heated side mirrors were only available with the leather package (and I am definitely a cloth upholstery man).  So when I read that ABS and heated side mirrors (with cloth upholstery!) were standard on the '99 Intrigue GL, I had to see this car for myself.  After the adrenaline rush of my test drive wore off, after relaxing in the incredibly comfortable seats, and after having fiddled with all the power controls and settings, I knew this was exactly the type of car I wanted.  Took some extra time to find the right color, condition, and mileage for the model year I wanted, but finally found one and bought it 6 months ago.  It is without question the best auto purchase I have ever made.  Got the 3.5L V6 model (recommended over the earlier '99 3800 V6 models), and with 215 HP/230 Torque under the hood, this car really moves while making a only a very low (and sexy) growl when fully engaged.  It has excellent steering and cornering, and is a very quiet ride.  Looks very sharp, especially with the spoiler.  Everyone who has seen and ridden in my car are similarly impressed, but most had no previous knowledge of this model -- the Intrigue is the best kept sporty sedan secret out there.<br><br>
