            I bought this car after I graduated college.  I was looking for a sedan that would be dependable, roomy, and inexpensive.  But, I got this instead.  Even though it is leased, I have spent $600 on the brakes (and there is still something wrong with them) and $200 for the radiator hose.  Pontiac covers nothing and despite my constant complaining, they refuse to pay for anything.  There customer service is like a brick wall.  I got in an accident with it.  I could see that I was going to be rear ended and floored the thing but it would not go anywhere and still got rammed.

Quality and Craftsmanship

When driving this car, it feels like the thing is going to fall apart at any given moment.  It rattles, shakes, and pushes me all over the road even when it is not windy.  The seats are so uncomfortable that I get a terrible backache every time I drive it.  I now make my boyfriend drive it and I drive a 93 Blazer-MUCH BETTER and much more dependable.  Either the seats are too low or the windshield is too slanted, but visibility is poor. I have to sit up really straight and cran my neck in a strange manner to see the front of the hood.  It is a terrible design.  The transmission has hesitation in it.  It feels like it shifts too late.  I drove my friend's Gallant and could not believe the difference.  I could see the road actually!  If you ever see a Sunfire blowing around the road, weaving like a drunk, you will understand why.
