            I am a new driver and this is the car that Warnock has donated to my school for teaching Behind the wheel.  Its a very smooth ride and the pick up is nice.  THe brakes should b a little easier to use and i dont reccomend this car for people over 6ft because it is pretty small. the back seat is pretty roomy for a small car and i reccomend this for your first car because from what i have heard its not too pricey.  It a compact car so its nice and easy to parallel park and its pretty zippy too!  over all its not that bad of a car.<br><br>
