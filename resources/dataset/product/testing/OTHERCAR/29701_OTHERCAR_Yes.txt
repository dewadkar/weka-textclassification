            This weekend my family was interested in an assortment of cars. After having a strict criteria for our home usage we narrowed the selection of cars down to the Ford 4Runner and the Infiniti QX4. As money was no object we decided to look at the features. As this article is about QX4 i will only discuss its amazing features

Features:

1. Black leather interior with awesome wood trim.
2. Reclining back seats
3. Generous leg room
4. Memory seats( THis records positions of your sitting position, to remember where you like to sit at in your car)
5. Easy design buttons for simple configuration of your stereo and other options of heather and a/c.
6. Large compartments for a lot of storage.
7. Large storage capacity that can handle any amount of luggage on a trip
8. Creamy ride that is so smooth it seems i forgot at times its still an SUV
9. Reasonably plriced due to our quote from carsdirect.com. We took the quote from the website and used it to make our final offer to the dealership $3,000 dollars cheaper. This worked out very good saving us so much money.

Overall the 4Runner was a good car as well. Though it reminded my family of a truck and the luxurious looking QX4 is incomparable in the aspect of outside looks and inside interior. For hauling cargo you may get a better job done with the 4Runner, but a Qx4 is a nice car. Last to note the cars 240 horses kicking with its v6.<br><br>
