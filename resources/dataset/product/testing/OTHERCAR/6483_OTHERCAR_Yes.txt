            I have a 2003 C320 and drove it for a year. 

First, the C class is the most reliable of all MB. This information is coming from the MB Service Manager of one the largest dealers in California. My car has been trouble free and runs well without any problems. So the recent quality control problems of MB does not apply to the C class.

The transmission is extremely smooth. In fact, the 5 speed automatic transmission of this car is just as responsive and quick as my old manual transmission Ford. The car downshifts and upshifts very quickly with very little lagtime. And the shift is hardly noticeable. It is almost as if the car doesn't have a transmission and runs on one gear.

It is becoming apparent to me that the midsize family sedans (Accord, Camry, and Altima) are catching up very quickly with the luxury segment. I test drove my coworkers new Accord V6 and I was extremely impressed. In fact, I liked the Accord's ride and smoothness even BETTER than my C320. If I had to choose which car is better, it would honestly be a coin toss.

One major gripe I have of this car is its audio system.  I It came with the Harmon Kardon 10 speaker system which is wired with fiber optics. If I want to switch my audio to a third party vendor like Sony, I have to pay $140 extra to completely rewire the stereo system. Also the standard 6 CD changer does not play CDR or MP3. The audio plays well and sounds good, but any attempts of upgrading it will cost you extra for the wiring.
