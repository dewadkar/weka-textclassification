            My husband and I stopped into a Saturn dealership on a whim one day.  We were thinking of trading off our gas hog Explorer, but had no immediate plans.  I had seen the VUE and loved how it looked.  We have heard such incredible things about Saturn cars and the dealerships, so we thought we would stop in.  Two hours later we walked out with the keys in our hand!

I have a long commute everyday to work, so I needed a car that was dependable, comfortable, and got great gas mileage.  Which I have gotten with my VUE.  I am very impressed with how smooth the VUE handles and rides. The V6 has plenty of power to handle the hilly Ozark roads.  

The interior isn't as plush as in my Explorer, but nice none the less.  I wish they had offered leather in the 2002 or that I had held out for the 2003.  

I purchased my VUE in June, and since I have had the molding on the back passenger door fixed twice, the AC was dripping into the floor on the driver's side, the driver's window doesn't always want to roll back up after using the express roll down (they claim they can't get it to do it, but it does it for me every time).  My brakes have started making a funny noise, and every now and then when I start to apply the brakes they go on really hard.  All of this and only 8,000 miles on it!

Also, the AC seems to have a hard time keeping up with Missouri summers.  I even had the windows tinted in order to keep the cabin cooler.  It helps, and even increased my fuel mileage from 22 to 23 mpg, but still isnt' as cool as I think it should be.
