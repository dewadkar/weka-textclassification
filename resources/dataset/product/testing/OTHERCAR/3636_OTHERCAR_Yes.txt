            I needed reliability at an affordable price. I wanted a mid size car so I could fit behind the wheel without feeling jammed in.  I looked for a car that would handle safely on long road trips and had room enough for my family. I found it in the 1999 Grand Prix we bought. It sells as a compact, but drives like a mid size in comfort and room.  I hate only have one and am planning to buy a 2000 soon.  It grabs the road, hugs corners, and looks sleek and elegant. I am averaging around 300+ miles per tank of gas in town. It is great for families, business, or as a first car. <br><br>
