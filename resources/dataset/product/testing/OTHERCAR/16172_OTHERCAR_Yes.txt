            Bought MX-2900 ten months ago as an advanced snapshhoter's , mainly to get grandbaby pictures.
After a little over 1000 pictures here are good and bad points from my personal point of view :

Pro: Very good pictures, as long as saved as 500K or so JPG's and minimal sharpening, reserving all image adjustment to a PhotoShop.
Capacity to use external flash with more power than buil-in, or bounce or multiple flash are great.
Manual settings very usefull in spite of limited choice f/ stops ( 4 and 8 ), being able to proof results on LCD allows adjustments to be optimized, better than blindly bracketing on film.
Good provision for front element accesories: Wide angle, macro even slide duplicator adaptors fit easily

Con : Variable but long delay between pressing shuter and recording picture makes accurate timing of image capture impossible.
Propietary battery a problem; prefer rechargable NiCad AA's.
