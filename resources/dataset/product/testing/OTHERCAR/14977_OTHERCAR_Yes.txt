            What a surprise.  A friend gave me a Sony Mavica FD73 for my birthday (Some nice friend!).  I've been using a snapshot camera for years, after my SLR died, so this is a big change for me.  I've always had an eye for photography, but have not, for many years, had the equipment to really do the kinds of things I'd like.

The FD73 is the middle range of Sony digital cameras and it's not without its shortcomings.  The LCD is almost impossible to see in bright sun, so taking pictures outside on a sunny day becomes guesswork, but with the purchase of an optional &quot;sun shade,&quot; that problem can be helped (it's not perfect but it's a vast improvement).  In low light, photos can be a bit grainy, but still better than I've been accustomed to.

The LCD screen is quite vulnerable, as the camera comes in the box, but the purchase of a protector screen to fit over the LCD screen easily solves that problem.  ($10 for the protector and $10 for the sun shade)

However, when it is good, it is very <i>very</i> good.  The 10x zoom allows for wonderful close ups, the photos, while not as crystal clear as you would get from some more expensive cameras, are nothing to sneeze at.  It's extremely easy to use.  And it allows you to take photos in full color, black and white, negative, sepia, or solorized (which produces some interesting color effects).  

I love the fact that all photos are stored on disk.  I've read reviews from folks who don't like this feature, but I love it.  I get 25-30 pictures on disk and it's so easy to just pop it into the computer to check the photos full size.  

The low end battery (330) will give you 120 minutes and the higher end (550) gives you 240 minutes.  Turning the camera off between shots prolongs the life significantly--one charge on the 330 will last me a week (and that's taking lots of photos).  There is also a plug-in battery available, if you're going to be doing a lot of photographing near a power source.

I have not yet used the camera on a trip, but will be going on vacation soon and looking forward to giving it a real workout.  For the first time I can take unlimited photos without worrying about cost of film or developing, or worrying about the time (and expense) of putting all those pictures in books when I get home!<br><br>
