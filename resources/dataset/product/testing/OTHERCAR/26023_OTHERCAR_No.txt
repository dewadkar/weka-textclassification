            When looking for a new car, I decided to test drive a 2000 Chevy Cavalier because I figured it is a nice sporty looking car for a person on a tighter budget. After driving it, I was not all that impressed. Unless you try out the souped up sporty model, the inside of the car is very basic and cheap looking. The car drove all right - but lacked power and was not too smooth of a ride. The seats were not real comfortable either. I've noticed that this car is quite popular around my college town, but this is probably because it is a cheaper car. This is a case of &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;<br><br>
