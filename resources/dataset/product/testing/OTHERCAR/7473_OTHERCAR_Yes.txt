            I have had this vehicle since 3/2003 and have to say that it is a very value packed vehicle. I haven't had any major repairs done yet at 45k miles. Warranty work included having the rotors resurfaced and leaking power steering line replaced. AC works great, very responsive steering and braking make you feel more like part of the driving experience rather than playing a video game. Looks great with the stock 16" chrome-techs (polished aluminum wheels very easy to clean). This particular model that I purchased was the GT1 sedan which includes leather seats, steering wheel mounted controls for radio and cruise control. Stereo has a 7 band equalizer, compact disc player and cassette deck, automatic headlights when it gets dark out.
