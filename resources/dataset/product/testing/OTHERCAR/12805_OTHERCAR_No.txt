            I was looking for a replacement for my Nikon 950 a long time ago and wanted to try something else.  The Canon S20 was the smallest 3.3Mpel camera I could find, and did not look as 'clunky' as the nikon coolpix 990.

There were a few signs of trouble from the beginning.  
1. I find the flash was even weaker than the old nikon950 which was itself not bright enough.  Taking pictures indoors or at night is not worth the effort if your room light is low.  Pictures always comes out bad.

2. It takes non std batteries that don't last as long.  The old nikon950 took AA's so I could get 1500mAH NiMH rechargeables cheaply and they last long enough for me to fill a 128MB CF outdoors if I switched off the monitor.  This one requires a $100 rechargeable battery that WILL not even fill half of a 128MB CF.   This means you really need two of them for a proper session (IE: we are talking $200 extra for batteries here instead of $25 for AA-NiMH and charger).

3. When viewed on a screen, the extra pixels did not make the pictures any better than my old Nikon coolpix 950.  In fact, when I took similar material in bright sunlight --- I saw that the pictures look either too blue or too red, but the color was definitely off here.

If I didn't already own a nikon coolpix 950, I would have thought this was a great camera, but I did, so this is not a good one to buy.  Spend a little more and get a better camera.

I was disappointed with this camera, and will probably get another brand when I upgrade, perhaps a higher res Nikon.
