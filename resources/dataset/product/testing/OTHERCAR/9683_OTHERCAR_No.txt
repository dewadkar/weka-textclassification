            My friend bought this car 3 years ago. Its a white Mitsubishi Gsx with 45,000 miles on it. He has the 5 speed and occasionally races it. He has had head gasket problems, turbo problems, and other engine problems. It might be due to the turbo boost of 14ft/lbs. Besides the engine problems this car rips. My friend put an exhaust system and an intake on it(blow off too) and he runs low 14's high 13's. The car pulls through every gear. Especially of the bottum with all the torque it has. In first gear will popping the clutch I can actually hear the tires grip while thrusting you back into your seat. The gears on the car are very close which means you'll be flying through the gears. Maybe its just me cause the car goes so quick its time to shift. I raced him with my 99 Honda Prelude and got beat by a good length. The start he flew out and by the time i hit third gear(The best gear in a Prelude) he was gone. i was slowely catching up to him in fourth gear but that is far after the 1/4 mile. We switched cars and drove them. Man its a torque monster compared to mine but flattens out after 3rd gear. I like the whisteling noise of the turbo. and the loud blow off valve pshhhhhhh when I shift. I didn't like the interior as much as of the Preludes but it might of been due to the couple years of difference between the two cars and that I am just used to mine. I liked his car but he has to many problems with it. Thats the main facter why I bought my Honda Prelude. Its fast and you'll beat a ton of corvette's, z28's, camero ss's, Firebirds but its not worth the repairs. I have video footage on my computer if anyone wants to see it of another buddy who owns a eagle talon modded pretty good. Its racing a firebird and whooped it. email me for it and I will gladly send it to you over aim or icq or email(don't know if it will fit).
later,
