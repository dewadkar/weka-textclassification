            I have not seen many reviews that refer to the resale value.  I traded in a 98 Voyager valued at $8250.00 in fair to good condition (transmission was going out, no warranty.) The same year Odyssey (98) resells between 14K and 20K depending on condition.  I was 5K upside down on the Voyager and figured the 02 Odyssey would help me here.

The 3.5L 240 horsepower engine (same engine as in the $45K Acura 3.5RL) and 5 speed transmission with improved grade logic is a bonus. The handling is tight and responsive for a van. I am very impressed.  It closer resembles my Acura TL than the Voyager van.  The breaking is great and hopefully with 4 wheel disk breaks they will last longer than past Odyssey models. 

I did some research on the power sliding doors for "02" and I believe Honda has worked out the bugs.  Our local dealer has a "Door Specialist" just for these power doors and he stated that the 02's are nearly "perfected" and less are coming in for repair.  Hopefully repairs will remain low even after all the 02's are on the street.

People have said the Honda is expensive but when I compared the Town & Country with heated leather getting as close to an "apples to apples" comparison I found in this town the Honda EX-L was 4K less.  I did have to wait 3 weeks and I did pay retail which again was still less expensive than other models with the same features.  

My only concern at this point is some noises I am already hearing coming from various areas of the interior.  It is mostly on rougher roads but I really hope it does not get any worse with age.  I may just be spoiled because the Acura TL is really tight and quiet.  Obviously the reliability factor on the 02 has yet to be seen, from other reviews it appears there are many lemons in previous model years running around out there.
