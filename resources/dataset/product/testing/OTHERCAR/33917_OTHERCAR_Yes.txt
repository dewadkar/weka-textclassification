            Other considered were the Honda CRV, Jeep Liberty, Suzuki Grand Vitara XL7, and the Ford/Mazda twins. 

   The Honda was fine, but the styling was on the bland side. I liked the manual transmission on the CRV, which is not available on the Highlander. It was less expensive and easier to find on the lots. But the relatively narrow top, on the chunky bottom makes it look like a station wagon. It was similar to the Subaru Forester. A very strong alternative,at a very good price.

   An odd thing about the Jeep Liberty was a surprisingly narrow driver's footwell. I measured it after the test drive, its two inches narrower than a Grand Cherokee. Which made a difference. I need to stretch out a little, I'm 6'3". Nix the Liberty on comfort(for me).The Suzuki had a fantastic lease deal, unuseable third row seat and a very trucklike ride.

   The Ford and Mazda utes were almost perfect. Good mileage, good room, great acceleration, good price. What kept me away was the recalls (5) and the bickering over who was responsible for the tire/rollover debacle on the larger Explorer. It tainted the brand, in my opinion. The model I test drove had Firestones, not on my list anymore.

  Back to the Highlander. It was considerably more expensive than the the others. I paid $26,600 for my four cylinder 4X4 with mudguards, roof rack, running lights, Tow package, quick order package and mats. Not what I would have ordered, but available. The option codes are MG/DL/TO/QO/CF.

  I like the dark tinted windows on the QO package, get this. The truck needs another a place to put a wallet, or palm etc. I don't want the center console, its convenient to walk through. I took the ashtray out and put my cell phone inside the dash. I drag it out by the cord. Since I don't smoke this was a nice place for the phone.

   The four cylinder, even with the four wheel drive is adequate. Much faster than my first drive, a 1973 Chevrolet Vega GT. The six is much faster, but I took the four for the lower purchase price and the slightly better mileage. Try the four before you get the six, if you don't need the speed, save some money. The four 4X4 is rated at 19 city and 24 highway. Read the torque numbers on the four, better than my old Mazda's six at the low end.

    The headroom is great, one of my co-workers is 6'8" and he has room to spare. The rear seat is very roomy, the best seat in the house. The seats fold almost flat. I compared same to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, this has more useable room, particularly for the passengers.

   The handling is fine, it feels slightly tippy, but I am coming out of a low slung Mazda Millenia. Visibility is superior, the high ride and real big mirrors (power, standard) help.

    Ok, its a sample of one, but my first tank was 20.2MPG, with a fair amount of light city driving. The mats were the best bargain, get them, they fit PERFECTLY. The powertrain warranty is 5 years or 60K miles, 3 years 36K on everything else except tires. Yes, even though its a Toyota it influenced me to buy. In the unlikely event I got a bad one, I want a security blanket.
     Update: November 24th 2001. The four wheel drive worked great on the beaches of Nags Head NC. I passed a Ford F150 and a Dodge Ram on two different days, stuck in the sand and the Highlander
rocked a little more than the pickups but the 4wd worked admirably.
