            I missed having my 4x4s. I wanted something durable that could take a beating, but not something that was abused. I've owned other full sized Chev trucks (one 74 full time four wheel drive and an 80 1/2 ton pick-up).

But I've also owned various Jeep models too, but am always being drawn back to General Motors products. The 84 Jimmy is no exception. I found this one is great shape for $1780 ($2400 Cdn). The body does have some rust, but not as much as there could be for a 19 year old truck. Heck I've seen newer cars/trucks with more rust. However I cannot attest this to owner pride, amount of use and care in a vehicle or GM quality?

The engine currently has 168080 miles (270500 km). Any work that has to be done on the engine is so amazingly simple as there is so much room under the hood. Try changing 8 spark plugs in under 15 minutes on a newer vehicle...

I have yet to take the old girl off-road anywhere, but looking forward to letting her stretch her legs.

Not sure what else I can say on a 19 year old truck. If you find one that was well taken care of at a reasonable price, I'd say go for it. They are hard on gas if this is a concern. Currently I'm getting around 9 mpg combined highway and in town driving, but there are a few things I have to do to it to help.

Of course it's going to ride like a truck. And having a short wheel base makes rough roads more noticeable.

Getting the kids in and out is a simple chore. The passenger seat is the only seat the allows rear access. A flip of the lever allows the whole seat to up and away. My wife stands about 5'2" and can get the kids belted in easier than in the minivan we own.

If there's anything else you would like to know, feel free to contact me. Overall, it's big, drinks gas, gives you a great view of the road, dependable pending amount of preventative maintenance preformed over it's life. Parking lot spaces are getting smaller, get used to the long walk to the door of the store but we all need to exercise. more anyway right? ;)
