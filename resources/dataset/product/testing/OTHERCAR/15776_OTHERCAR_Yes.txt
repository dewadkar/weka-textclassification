            When I finally decided to purchase a new car (this choice was made for me, when an SUV plowed into my 1990 Toyota Camry), I was looking for a few major things. Firstly, with gas prices fluctuating monthly and with relative instability in many, if not all, of the the world's most prominent oil-bearing regions, I needed a car that could give me the biggest bang for my buck. The Prius has been marketing as a money-saving automobile and let me tell you first hand that it delivers. I live in a hilly, surburban area where gas mileage has never been too great. However, I've discovered that by learning how to drive me Prius most effectively, I can dramatically increase the time it takes to empty my tank. Coasting down hills and braking at the correct times actually delivers power to the Prius' electric motor, saving gasoline. 
Not only do you feel the electric motor quietly kicking in, you also get to see exactly what's going on! In place of the standard dash board, is a colorful touch-screen monitor. Using this monitor, you can determine your gas mileage for trips or for the life of the car (mine now exceeds 52.5 miles/gallon). The radio is controlled by the touchscreen as well, although standard controls may be found below. The screen sometimes gets distracting, but it can always be turned off.
The car has ample foot/head space and trunk space. It runs more quietly than any car I've ever been in, thanks to the electric motor. The last thing I'll mention, is that the Prius does good acceleration. Its not for drag racing...

Anyways, I hope this was informative. The Prius is definately a good buy and I'm glad that I decided to purchase it.
