            After purchasing an earlier version of a digital camera and returning it I decided to wait for improvements.  The 2.1 megapixel Nikon takes pictures that have lots of pixels for excellent quality.  It is also feature rich.  The optical and electronic zoom is just one of dozens of bells and whistles that makes this camera useful in many situations. The ability to set two separate recording settings adds convenience and range of usefulness.  Handy buttons that speed selection of focus, quality, and flash settings add convenience.  
There are drawbacks though.  The memory storage is not convenient to use with a pc.  Additionally, to download pictures the Nikon requires the use of it's own browser called Nikon View.  This is not only inconvenient but the process can change configuration settings on your computer.  <br><br>
