            I purchased the Agfa 780 just before the birth of my daughter, thinking it would be a great way to send pictures to friends and family.  I have been very happy with the results.  Although I'm sure that more expensive cameras have more features, this one has just about everything I need (It only lacks a zoom).  I was pleasantly surprised at the battery consumption.  I had heard that digital cameras eat batteries like crazy, but after 7 months of heavy usage, I'm only on the 3rd set.  If you are looking for a good and inexpensive beginner camera, this could be the one for you.<br><br>
