            I have been using my sony MVC-FD83 since Christmas of 99 and I have to say that I absolutely love it.

I have a few friends with digital cameras and they are always complaining about how much their memory modules cost and how hard it is to use. If you dont know, most digital cameras have a little memory module which stores the pictures you take. You must then transfer your pictures to a computer if you want to see them. If you want to get them printed you then have to transfer the pictures back to some type of a disk. 

This solution from sony does away with costly memory modules and transfering your pictures back and forth. How does it do this? Easy. Your film is a floppy disk. Each floppy disk can hold a little over 30 nice sized pictures at a normal quality setting. Considering that you can buy a 50 pack of flopy disks for around 10 dollars, that means you can snap about 1500 pictures for the price of developing one role of film! 

You have several options when taking your pictures. You can adjust the quality which goes from low to normal and then high. If you take many pictures on high quality you will find that your disks do not hold as many pictures. You will need to use this setting if you plan on enlarging any of your photos. You can pick resolutions (the size) of your picture from e-mail friendly to very large. 320x240 - 1024x786. 

The Sony camera also has the ability to add effects to your pictures as you take them. You can do black and white, sepia, negative and solarized effects right from the camera. There are also several lighting and focus setings so you can be sure your photos will turn out even in low light, or extremely bright conditions. I find these settings to be very useful because I like to go from maco photos (extremely close up) to landscape photos in a hurry. 

The LCD display on the sony camera is very large and well lighted. It can become difficult to see if the sun is directly behind you, but you can usually shadow it quite eaisly. 

One of the really cool features of the camera is that it makes a little web page that indexes all of the files on the disk. It then puts this file on the disk so that you can just copy the disk and give it to your friends. If they havea web browser all they have to do is open that file (no matter what kind of computer they have) and they can browse the photos. 

I still think that probably the ultimate feature is that you can record short movies to send in e-mail. They, depending on quality, average 10 to 20 seconds in length before they fill up your floppy. This is plenty of time to say a quick hello to your family and zip it on its way across the internet. One of the added benefits of using the floppy disk is that the images are fairly small in data size so they will not take long at all to send over the internet. 

I recomend purchasing the accessory kit that matches the camera of your choice from this sony line. It comes with an extra battery that has a much longer life than the stock one. My stock battery will last for 90 minutes and the one form the accessory kit will last at least 160 minutes. I use my camera quite heavily and find that 160 minutes of on time equates into 5 days of picture taking. You will always want to remember and turn the camera off when your not in picture taking mode. Walking around with your camera on is not nessary because the camera powers up in about 5 seconds and is ready to shoot. 

The only drawback I can see with this camera is the fact that is is not well suited to action photos. I dont think there are many digital cameras that that can do this type of photography well as of yet. So if you are going to be taking action shots of your kids you may want to go with a higher end traditional camera and some 800-1000 speed film. 

The sony FD-83 is, in my mind, the perfect blend of price and performance for any digital camera on the market today. I am very happy with it, and I find my friends using it quite a bit too!  <br><br>
