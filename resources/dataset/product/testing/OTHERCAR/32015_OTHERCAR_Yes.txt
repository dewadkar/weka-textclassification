            My first thought when we purchased our Lexus ES 300 was that it is a &quot;girl's car&quot; and not particularly for men. This is OK. My wife loves the sporty little Lexus with its ability to scoot around in traffic - it is speedy and maneuverable. The CD stereo is second to none. The drink holders are great and the elecric seat warmer is really handy with the leather seats on cold days. 

I suggested it is not for men because of the low head room, pedal and steering distance, and small interior size. It really is too quiet to get a good feeling of the engine even though there is a tachometer and floor shifter. 

We have 30,000 miles on the car and have experienced no trouble with it. Buy this car for your wife and a pick up or Explorer for yourself and you will be happy.<br><br>
