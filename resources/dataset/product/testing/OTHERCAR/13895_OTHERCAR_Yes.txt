            In October 2000, I finally made the decision to start looking for a new car.  A friend was willing to buy my old one and I had been saving for three years, so I was ready.  I did research for about two months - I couldn't afford to make a mistake - and what it came down to was the Toyota Celica, the Honda Accord, and the Saturn SC2 3-door coupe.

The Toyota was my dream car, although I liked the '97 or '98 better than the newer model.  That put the car in my price range, so I searched the sale ads, but I wasn't sure I could find all the features I wanted on a vehicle with low mileage and a clean bill of health.  I kept it in mind though.

Interestingly enough, the Saturn dealer and the Honda dealer are right next to each other where I live.  It happened that we stopped at Saturn first, and did the usual test drive and review of the features.  They were having a special 1.9% financing, but it ended in the next two days, so we filled out an application right away and waited to see what happened.  We were far from a decision, but if we couldn't get the 1.9% that would be a factor.

So, while Saturn was processing our info, my husband went to work and I went to check out Honda.  I don't know if it was because I am a woman and I was on a car lot by myself or some other reason, but I got CRAPPY service - at TWO DIFFERENT dealerships!  I still test drove the Accord, and it was very similar to the Saturn, though not as sporty.  It was a little cheaper, and I knew Honda had a good reputation for reliability and safety, so I wasn't sure what to do.

My husband and I talked about it for a couple of days, and even went back to both Saturn and Honda to compare again.  We ended up getting approved for the 1.9% at Saturn, so that pushed us over the edge.  We went for it.

I have told you all this because buying a new car is a HUGE deal.  My guess is that there are lots of people out there going through the same things I went through, and it helps to know you're not the only one.

Anyway, we decided that since we were investing, we really should get all the features we wanted.  Even though the basic Saturn SC goes for $12-15K, our 3-door coupe with sun roof, AC, power everything, CD/cassette deck/radio, air bags, etc. came out to almost exactly $20K.  With the amount we put down and the 1.9%, however, we only end up paying $300 in finance charges over the next three years.  (That amount is included in the $20K, along with tax, title, license, and whatever else they charge you for in the fine print.)  We may have been able to squeeze a lower sale price out of Honda, but we may not have gotten such good financing.  (Just to compare, our friends are leasing a VW Jetta with similar features which will run them close to $24K in the end.)

I don't know exactly how insurance works, but I was really worried about my rates going through the roof with a brand new sporty car.  Not the case.  I have a good driving record, but I think that Saturn's reputation for safety helped keep the rates down.  I only pay about $100 more than I was paying on a '93 Toyota Tercel.

So, about the car itself....  I have now owned the car for 5 months and I am pretty satisfied.  There are lots of little features that are evidence of Saturn's effort to make the customer happy.  For example, there is an indicator on the fuel gauge that tells you what side the tank is on; you don't have to pay attention to mileage since a light comes on when you need to change the oil - no more guesswork; there are map lights on either side in the front so you can see when you pull over or your passenger can read.  And I LOVE the third door.  I find it perfect for me since I usually carry a lot of things back and forth to work and I always place them in the back seat.  This way, I don't have to constantly readjust my seat.

I feel very safe in my Saturn, and I am much more confident on the road than I used to be.  There is just enough power to make it feel like a sports car, but it doesn't guzzle gas like some sports cars.  I have been getting between 29 and 35 mpg, and one guy told me he was getting 40.  I suppose that if I could get the same gas mileage, I would opt for more ponies, but for the time being, it is a minor issue.  I still feel like a hotty driving around in my sweet wheels!

Customer service was great at Saturn, we felt informed without being pressured, and I have gone back several times to ask questions about the car and everyone has been extremely helpful.  I even went there one time when I found a few little chips in the paint on the front fender and was totally distraught.  They helped me work through it and realize that when you actually drive a car on the road, it is subject to that sort of thing.  (They were very supportive and didn't make fun of me at all :) )

Some things that I'm not crazy about are the small trunk and back seats.  Sometimes it is hard to get all of our groceries in the trunk.  The fold down back seats compensate for this a little bit, but are of little use when you are trying to take more than two people plus luggage to the airport.  The back seats are kind of stiff and don't allow much leg room, but it is not often that I have passengers, and the front seat is very comfortable with lumbar support, so I don't care that much.

The only other thing that bothers me a little bit is that the engine is loud in 2nd and 3rd gear.  I guess that is the nature of a sporty vehicle, but I find it obnoxious when I hear it on other cars, so I hope mine is not too loud to those on the outside.

Overall, I am very happy with my Saturn and expect to drive it for many years.  Perhaps some good advice for anyone looking at a new car is to remember that it is a give and take situation - there are only so many cars out there with the exact features you want and it is likely that you will have to settle for something slightly different than your ideal car.  In my case, I had to take dark green over black, pay a little extra for side air bags or give up the sun roof, and give in to the $500 it would cost to get my car here from Tennessee.

Some little notes about Saturn in particular:  Only buy the "Touch of Class" or other protective coatings if you park your car in direct sunlight a lot or if you have to park under trees all the time.  Otherwise, it is overpriced.  You can buy similar products that you apply yourself for less.  Also, the car is a little creaky when you first get it.  It seems as if it has to settle in to being used - like breaking the binding on a new book.  I'm hoping that's all it is anyway - if it turns out to be more, then I'll let you know!

By the way, they really did sing me a little song when I picked up my car.

Happy hunting!
