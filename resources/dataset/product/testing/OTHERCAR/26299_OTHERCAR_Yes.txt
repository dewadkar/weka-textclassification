            On January 30, 2000 I went to pick up my brand spanking new Honda Civic 2000 EX Coupe. I choose a Vogue Silver Metallic. I choose the automatic transmission. When I test-drove the Civic the first thing I notice was how smooth it run. For an economy car it was truly fast. Once I hit 5500 RPM the car kicks into VTEC mode, which gives it a little extra boost. It handles very well, turns like you never felt it. Its not a sport car but handles like one. You will get over 300miles with a full tank of gas, it doesn�t cost as much to fill up the tank too. The stereo system is excellent. It�s loud, clear and has bass. This is my first car and I think its great. Its made by a reliable manufactured and this car will last me for years. 
Some facts that the Civic EX has are:

1.6 liter 127 VTEC 4 cylinder
Power windows and power moon roof
CD/AM/FM 6 Speakers
Air Conditioner/ Heater
Power Door Locks
Keyless Entry
Driver Passenger Air Bags
