            I had my last car for 13 years and 140,000 miles. It was time to replace it since I need a very reliable commuter car and, on the weekends, a second family car. For reliability, my alternate choice was a used Honda Accord. But, for about the same price, I got a brand new 1999 Hyundai Elantra GL with a 5 year bumper-to-bumper warranty. You won't get that with a used Honda. I took a five year loan on this car instead of leasing. If at the end of five years I'm not ready for a change, the drive train warranty will continue for another 5 years.

The car was delivered in 2 hours from purchase time and had no defects. I've had it for 9 months now - no defects have appeared and it has required no repairs. The car was well equipped with automatic transmission with overdrive, A/C, am/fm/cassette, clock, intermittent wipers, tilt wheel, alarm, and a 140hp engine. I won't get into all the details that make this an outstanding value here, you can find that elsewhere. But some of the specific things I liked were the styling, the firm handling, the head and legroom (front and back) since I'm 6'1&quot;, the large trunk, and two full size child seats can fit in the back seat. The car is very comfortable for short or long trips. Many of the things this car won't offer you (or you should skip to keep the reliability up and the cost down) are things that tend to break over time and are costly to repair (like power windows, seats, locks, antenna, etc.).

The ONLY disappointment I have with this car is there is no glove box light - but I'll get over it.<br><br>
