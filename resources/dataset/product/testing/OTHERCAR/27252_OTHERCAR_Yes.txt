            I bought my 2000 'Bird in August at the behest of my wife and two young daughters.  (No, really, my wife brought it up and talked me into it.)  I had an '86 Firebird SE and absolutely loved it but I figured I'd had my fun and besides, the family needed a sedan so I was going to get a Grand Prix.  Thankfully, I listened to my wife, this time.  

First the positives.  The styling is incredible!  I opted for the base Firebird with the &quot;sport appearance package&quot; and, even though I would have loved to get the Ram Air hood I couldn't justify the extra expense and insurance that went with it.  But the lines are definitely head turning.  

The cockpit wraps itself around you and you become one with the car.  You sit just low enough, the seats support you perfectly, the console and door handles are at the perfect height for your arms and the gear shift and stereo controls (I never use the steering wheel controls.) are just the right distance away that a flick of the wrist sends the speakers screaming (I think Motley Crue's &quot;Wild Side&quot; was written to be blown out of a Firebird's speakers.)

The engine is adequate.  3.8 Liters gets you where your going, and quickly, but it won't snap your head back like it's big brothers.  Gas mileage is surprisingly good.  I get about 22 during normal driving.  I don't jump it but I don't baby it either.

Now for the negatives.  But first a qualifier.  Most of my complaints are based on comparisons with my '86.  If I hadn't owned that one my bad list probably would be quite short.

The gauges are difficult to read because they tend to get hidden by the steering wheel on which those insidious radio controls lie.  The seat belt clasp sits midway up on the belt which makes it difficult to reach while buckling up.  The rear deck is totally messed up from the older version.  There is less usable storage space and the t-top storage configuration is not as user friendly as before.  It can be difficult to judge distances while backing due to the spoiler.  

The biggest disappointment however has little to do with Pontiac and a bunch to do with Goodyear.  The Eagle GA's that came on the car are absolute garbage.  They feel like you're driving on balloons.  You touch the wheel and you feel the car respond.  A week later the tires get the message.  It really takes the fun right out of driving.  Thankfully this will pass.  

In conclusion, I light a candle to the shrine of my wife because she talked me into the 'Bird.  I had my first one for 9 years and 135,000 miles.  I plan on having this one for twice as long.  I wouldn't have any other car as my main car if you gave it to me.  Every second behind the wheel is pure joy and I would recommend this car to anyone with the ability to appreciate what a Firebird stands for. <br><br>
