            I never owed one but I WANT one so bad .... that is defenitely the car I am getting!!!  The Space, the build, the shape, the way it drives, EVERYTHING about it is awesome .... its a defenite yes in my book.  The handling on it is SOOO good, u can take sharp turns at 40 mph and even more no prob at all.  The sound system is booming ... it's GREAT .... try one, you have absolutely NOTHING to lose, and I do mean nothing .... So dont just take my word for it ... try one today, its the best deal you'll ever get :)
