            As Consumer Reports' top pick for a mini van in 2000, the Odyssey is one of the best buys in the market not only for its good reliability, but also because it is at a fair price. At $23,000 you can get the LX model, but I opted for the upgraded EX version for about $26,000 base price with no options.

Basically if you are going to buy a Odyssey, you should go for the EX version like I did. For the extra 3,000 you get a better seat material and you get power sliding doors. The power sliding doors come in handy if you have kids, because only with a small starting pull, the door then closes the rest of the way by itself. With the EX you also get the CD player, remote keyless entry and alloy wheels all standard. More power is also added from the LX 3.5 L V6.

If you live in areas where you get snow, the Odyssey is a good choice of van because the EX trim has a special traction control. However, the Odyssey is a 2 wheel drive only vehicle. On some of the Dodge vans, there is an optional 4 wheel drive.

If you buy the EX, you can get the optional Satellite Linked Navigational System.  I bought this item for $2,000 but I am realizing that I really don't need it. Just buy a $3.95 map or ask for directions if you can't find a specific place.

There is 210 horsepower at 5200 rpm and the fuel economy is an average of 18 city/ 25 hwy. The interior room was the biggest out of the Dodge Grand Caravan Sport AWD and Toyota Sienna CE.

The second row seats on all 2000 Odysseys can convert fairly easily from bucket seats to a bench. Also, the third row seats can be folded down beneath the rear load floor.

Some of the standard features included on the LX or EX trim include air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, tilt steering, and power windows to just name a few.

As with testing the performance of this vehicle, I bought it in April and it has not had any problems. But ofcourse there should not be any if it is only a few months old.

One thing that I thought was kind of bad was that you really could not haggle with the dealers like with other companies like Ford. Or maybe it is like that only in my town where there is only one Honda dealer and they sell at MSRP.<br><br>
