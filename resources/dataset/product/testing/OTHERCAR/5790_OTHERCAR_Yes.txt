                 I brought this product for my wife on her birthday , however I am
discovering that it is a present for both of us. I choose this product
after reading magazine reviews , epinions , and checking out the cameras
features first hand in the store. This camera has all the features I
(we) wanted . It has both an optical and LCD view finder. Mutiple flash
features, optical, and digital zoom lenses 3X optical and 2.5X telephoto.
It uses a smart media card , and comes with an 8MB card. I picked up a
64 Meg card for $55.00 which I recommend as it holds 64 high quality photos. Software is included that makes downloading onto your computer easy. The camera comes with an adaptor for a parallel port , which works
fine but is a little slow , so I recommend getting a smart card reader
or getting an adaptor for your floppy drive like I did. This saves time
and battery life. The card floppy adaptor cost about $50.00.Batteries
were also a concern of mine . This camera uses 4 AA batteries. It comes with 2 lithium double battery packs , but for about $30.00 you can get a charger and rechargable batteries for this camera. This is very inexpensive as far as digital cameras were concerned and could be a big expense.
     At first I considered a sony maciva because it uses floppys however
a floppy can only hold a few high quality photos so I reconsidered. I also checked out canon s-10 , and s-100 elph . they were nice but had no 
movie capabilities like the 490. I also liked the size of the camera as opposed to the sony (too big) canon (too small).Olympus 490 (just right).
     I found this camera easy to use , as did my wife who at first was a little intimidated by it. It can be used as a point and shoot , or you
can use more advanced options if you want to. The manual that comes with the camera is easy to use , and understand. The picture quality in most situations is great and can be enhanced with your computer for optimum
results. One area that it has a small problem with is dim yellow light
it is hard to get the colors just right without adjusting them in the computer.This camera also hooks up to a TV imput so it can be viewed on your television. You can also store your photos on floopy disc or CD if you have a CD writer.
     On the first day I used the camera I was able to E-mail photos put them on CD, on a floopy , and print out beautiful 8X10 photos on my Hewlett Packard Deskjet 12C this was on med. quality photo paper and
an inexpensive printer.
     What I love about the product is it ease of use to take great photos and the ability to use the photos in many ways. The 2.1 Megapixels is more
than enough to get great photos. Probably only pros really need more.
     One improvement that would help this camera would be to have a USB
connection, another would be to ship it with a large capacity memory card.
     I would recommend this camera to serious amateur photographers looking in the $500.00 price range.<br><br>
