            During the Spring Break, the family and I decided to go on a little vacation.  My child was having a time of her life.  So I decided to capture this image on a digital camera.  I went to the closest electricion's store and in my case it was &quot;The Wiz&quot;. My eyes were scanning around the room, from camera to camera.  Boom! then it hit me, my eyes lit up when saw I the Casio QV-2000UX. Right then and there I knew I was going to buy that one.  It was outstanding. This camera had the fastest, easy-to-use photographic capabilities as well as quick USB PC data exchange I ever seen.  Also it captured the quickest response of a camera that I seen.  The Casio QV-2000UX starts to capture images as soon as 2 seconds after you turn it on.  In my final statement, I would like to say that, If you would like a digital camera with all these high qualities and perfect for vacation, choose this one, the Casio QV-2000UX  I highly recommend it.
