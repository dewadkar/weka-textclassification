            Do you like monster SUVs with their gas hogging engines, hard to park bodies, and out-of-sight price tags? Or do you prefer the SUV wannabes? You know what I'm talking about...those small, squarish-looking mini Jeeps with no substance or personality. If you said &quot;yes&quot; to either question, then stay away from the Amigo, you'd hate it.

I had a 1989 Amigo for many years and finally after it survived two cross-country trips, numerous blizzards, two hail storms, and a fallen tree, I decided that was a sign to put him to rest. But it wasn't easy. Car makers tend to get overzealous these days and while making &quot;improvements&quot; to vehicles, sometimes forget the obvious. When I heard that Isuzu was bringing the Amigo back, I feared it wouldn't be enough of the same old model that I had grown to trust and enjoy. My apprehension was soon disbanded.

Isuzu added many good things: a more sculpted interior, more goodies such as two reading lights (effective yet concealed) under the rear view mirror, a fold down soft top, a rear door that opens without having to unzip the back window, padded roll bars all around, cup holders (one for big cups and one for regular cups, plus the same set-up on the two arm rests for the back seat), larger side mirrors, (two airbags and ABS, of course) and on-the-fly 4-wheel drive.

The new Amigo is solid, it gets decent gas mileage (in the 20s), easy to drive, easy to park, easy to load and unload. It's slightly narrower and a little shorter than the old model, but it still gives you a sense of security. If you have a family or taxi a lot of people around, you may not like the Amigo. While it isn't a chore to get in and out of the back, one does not look graceful while doing it. But for a single person or childless couples, it's nothing that should be a deterrent. 

The engine is so quiet that the first week I kept asking myself, while idling at stop lights, if it was actually running. Seriously. I have never heard such a silent engine, nor have I ever felt such a smooth ride on a 4-wheel drive car. 

I looked at Jeep Wranglers also. For the same price as the Amigo, if I went for the Wrangler I would've had to go without a back seat, a spare tire cover, full solid doors, carpeting, mats, sunroof, and door and rear seat compartments...to name but a few things.

New cars have less and less chrome and the Amigo is no exception, but it's still a head-turner. This is a fun, sharp-looking SUV at a good price. <br><br>
