            When I started looking for a digital camera in about June 2000, I researched and read many of the reviews that were written about the 'state of the art" digital cameras.   Even though I felt the QV3000Plus was a little pricey, I believed at the time that this would be the camera of choice.

I must admit that from the very start, I loved the capabilities this camera has.  The Pixel strength is great.  It stores an huge number of pictures. The 6:1 ratio is great.   The pictures are easy to download to a computer or e-mail.  You can shoot very short movies.  There are just alot of advantages to this camera.  

However, I don't know how long many of the other QV3000 Plus owners have had their cameras, but I discovered there is an issue with the 340 MB microdrive that comes with this camera.  After a very few hundred pictures (for me it took about 250 or so) the microdrive was done, caput, ready for the trash can.  I started receiving an error message that told me the microdrive needed to be formatted.  Then the microdrive died after the error message.  Thing is, Casio knows about the bad microdrive.

I looked up the website for Casio, called their Customer Service number in New Jersey, and told them what my problem was.  I was told that there was a problem with this microdrive, and that I should send it to a specific individual at their office in NJ, and that I should expect a new microdrive in about 2 weeks.  I waited for an eternity, and called again.  I was told my problem would have to be "elevated to the next level", but that someone would call me back the next day.  No one did.  I called back again, and was told the exact same thing.  I explained that I felt like I had spent almost $1000 on a piece of junk, and that this was wasting more of my money.  Finally, a couple of days later, someone told me that a new shipment of microdrives had been received from the manufacturer, and that I would receive another one by the next Monday.  And, I DID !!!

I put in new batteries with a full charge, and loaded that new Microdrive.  And did it take a picture??   Nope.  Can't even turn the camera on.   I receive an indication that the batteries are good, but then the camera goes dead.  

To date, I have not been able to obtain any help from Casio.  If I can get a good replacement from Casio, I'll take it.  
But would I buy another one ???  NO WAY, PERIOD.   From now on, I'll stick with someone that nows how to build a great camera - NIKON.
