                 I've read a lot of reviews on this vehicle from people expecting features of SUVs that are much bigger and twice as much money. This is not a sports car and its not a mini van. It is a small 4WD vehicle.
     Having said that, this is my favorite vehicle in my 20 year driving history. I bought the Sportage in the winter and discovered the 4WD makes far more difference in slippery conditions than I had realized. I live on a snow belt in Ontario and had to deal with a few nasty conditions. I constantly have to remind myself that many other vehicles on the road don't have 4WD or excellent tires that I do. Otherwise I'd lose my mind waiting for them.
     The sportage has already had to serve as my backup vehicle for work. I work in construction an have had the truck filled with tools and a considerable amount of weight in the form of drywall compound. I didn't experience that uncomfortable loss of handling that I would normally get with that much weight in a mini van. Most other vehicles in the same class as the Sportage would have already received substantial damage to the undercarriage in the conditions that I have driven this truck in. The Kia has a very clean underside, free of supension and exhaust parts that seem to hand down on most other small SUVs.
     I priced out four other trucks in the same class as the Sportage before I bought it. With the exact same features, the closest competitor was $6000 more when everything was added up. Everyone else seemed to find a way of adding costs like crazy. I was nervous about buying it because of some of the bad reviews. I'm a little upset now to realize that many of the poor reviews seem to are from people who shouldn't have bought or rented the truck in the first place. Like I wrote before, it's not a sports car. It has plenty of power for someone like me who doesn't have a heavy foot. I also have (and have always preferred) a manual transmission. Maybe if it was an automatic I would be a little more bothered by the power. 
     If I ever discover major flaws in this vehicle that need to be exposed, I'll be back here in a hurry. In the meantime, I hope someone with almost a million kilometers of driving experience now has given you some useful information.
