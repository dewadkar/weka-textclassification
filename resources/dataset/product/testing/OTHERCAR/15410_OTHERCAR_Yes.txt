            The Sony MCV-FD83 Mavica is not just any ordinary digital camera. And for under a $1000 , it comes packed with alot of features. Priced at $699 a consumer on a budget can start out with professional looking pictures without paying the profesional developing fee. I recently was able to review the Sony MCV-FD83 Mavica, and was very impressed. Several features caught my eye. Pictures on a floppy. Floppies are cheap and plenty. The ability to store 48 pictures on a floppy or 1 min and a half of video with sound. Very impressive for a sub-$1000 camera. Also the video-out plug and the ability to set up a slide show for your 48 pictures or video and project it right onto a monitor. Also several settings such as being able to take b/w photos,solarized photos and the list goes on. And the easy settings to optimize for best photos we a snap to navigate. <br><br>
