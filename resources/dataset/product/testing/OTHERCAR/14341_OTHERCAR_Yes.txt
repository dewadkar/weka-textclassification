            After reading about this car over the last several months I had to go and check it out the first weekend it arrived at the local dealer.

The new for 02 Altima is a HUGE improvement over last years "sock" styling.  The first thing that strikes you about the car is it's size.  Nissan is definatly moving upmarket with this years Altima.  Larger than the current Accord or Camry the Altima has smooth lines and breaks away from the sedated styling that plagues other auto manufacturers.  The look is fresh and new without being brash and should fit the lifestyle of those from their 20's-??  (While I was at the dealership a high school kid came in with his dad and remarked that this was better than the Civic they had just test drove.  My mother-in-law called me today saying she was at the dealership and had fallen in love with the car)

Here is where the BIG changes come in.  The Altima comes in 3 models; Base, S, and SE and with two engines - 

 2.4L 4cyl producing 190hp (not bad considering that the Camry produces the same horsepower using a V6)

3.5L 6cyl producing 240hp!!! (The same as last years BMW M3) This is the same engine that is in the 2002 Maxima that produces 255hp and the Infinity I30 @ 260hp.

The base 2.4L can be had for about $18,000 a top of the line 3.5L SE with all the bells and whistles will set you back about $26,000.

The car drives great and has a very tight road feel.  Road noise is extremely low for a car at this price.  The BOSE sound system is standard in the higer models and is worth the extra $$$.  A few options that are VERY nice.

Side impact airbags
Xenon Headlights (so white they look blue)
17" alloy wheels on the SE
16" alloys on the Base and S models
Speed sensitive stereo controls (the faster you drive or increase wind noise will automatically adjust stereo sound)
Huge Trunk!
Timing chain - NOT A BELT
Cool gear shifter
60/40 split rear seats

Cons - 
I personally did not like the layout of the instrument panel.  I thought it looked cheap and is one the one thing that could keep me from buying the car.  The controls for the heat and air look like they were taken from the design factory at Ford.  The sunroof is marginal at best - it does the job it is meant to do, but it could stand to be bigger.

All and all I think the new Altima is going to change the way Toyota and Honda look at Nissan.  My guess that the 260hp engine that you now see in the Acura(Honda)TL Type S will soon make its way down to the upper-end Accords.  Both Toyota and Honda will need some time in R&D to catch up with Nissan when it comes to cost and available options.

Personally I can't wait to test drive the 2002 SE Maxima with the new 6-speed tranny and 255hp that will be at the dealers in October.  (ps - If you like this review make sure you check back for that one!)
