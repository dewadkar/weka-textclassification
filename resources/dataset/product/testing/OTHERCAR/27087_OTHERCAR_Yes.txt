            The Dodge Viper is in a class all by itself. With its Michelin MXX3 performance tires, standard power mirrors and satin-finish aluminum interior trim it is a must have vehicle for anyone willing to part with over 76,000 dollars. The Dodge Viper comes in two different models, the RT/10 2 Dr Convertible and the GTS 2 Dr Coupe. Although the Coupe is a little more spendy (76,793) both models are state of the art. This vehicle will amaze the driver both in its handling and in its performance. The Viper is so smooth and so easy to drive that it practically drives itself. This car is guaranteed to turn the eyes of passers-by and spice up the love life of the lucky owner. If for no other reason I would buy this vehicle simply because of how well it performs and how exciting it is to drive. I would compare driving this vehicle with floating in space. The ride is that smooth. Unlike most cars that have a hard time taking rough corners or stop and go in a jerky manner, the Dodge Viper accelerates, turns, and stops in a remarkably smooth fashion. It literally defies the rules of physics. 
The negatives about the Dodge Viper besides the price is that it gets poor gas mileage and offers a limited amount of cargo room. The large increase in insurance that is bound to coincide with the purchase of this vehicle is another factor that should influence the buying decision of the consumer. All in all, the Dodge Viper is an amazing vehicle that is a must have for anyone searching for the ideal sports car.<br><br>
