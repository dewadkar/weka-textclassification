            The Land Rover Discovery Edition is definitely one fine automobile.  Before I say anything else, I will say that this one is worth the price.  This vehicle has basically any option available for any car.  I'm sure if you wanted to pay the price you could have this car fly with the push of a button.  It combines probably the best off road power with a quick acceleration.  It also has one of the best antitheft systems installed so you can protect your investment.  There's plenty of room to put anything and everything inside and for those things that wont fit inside, you can just drag them behind you on a trailer with this powerful engine.  In my opinion the Discovery even has one of the most appealing appearances that I've seen.  This car would definitely be on my recommendation list to those who have a good 30 or 40 grand to spend on a perfect automobile.<br><br>
