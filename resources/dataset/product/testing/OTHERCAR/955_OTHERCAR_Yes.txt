            If you are looking for the most bang for your buck, look no further...chevrolet corvette is IT!  The CORVETTE C5 is the most aerodynamic vehichle of any car in the world with the exception of the ev-1 gm's electric car.  The CORVETTE boasts a .29 coefficient of drag.  It is powered by a small block V8.  It delivers 345 hp, while also delivering exceptional gas mileage and low engine noise.  With it's new in the C5 generation transaxle design, it's weight ratio is 51/49.  This makes the vehichle an exceptional riding sports car, yet a very good handling one as well.  If you've ever been in a tru sports car, you know comfort is sacrificed for performance....not the CORVETTE!  I have been in the automobile industry for the better part of a decade.  I have sold all lines of General Motors products, as well as several other brands.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR DRIVEN A FINER CAR...EVER!!  The CORVETTE offers a hardtop coupe, a removable top coupe and a convertible.  All of the new C5's have a 4 inch lower kick panel, and over an inch in each direction addede room.  These features make CORVETTE much easier to get in and out of, and more comfortable when you are in.  Also, there is more room in the new C5 for &quot;baggage&quot;.  The new convertible has room for 2 sets of golf clubs.  That's important....now you don't have to leave your baby at home, just to play a round of golf with a friend!  This car is perfect.....no more bang for the buck anywhere in the world!<br><br>
