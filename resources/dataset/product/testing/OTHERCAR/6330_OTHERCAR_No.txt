            We bought our 1998 Sienna in June of 1998.  We put our trust in the Toyota name.  The first problem we noticed was when you turned left, the steering wheel skipped a little bit. The dealer replaced the Power Steering Gear (6,351 miles).  We also noticed the breaks squeaking.  The dealer ordered and replaced front pads and a shim kit(7,101 miles). We had the Green Service performed by the dealer at 22,608 miles. We noticed that the break pedal was clicking at this time.  The break pedal pivot point was lubricated and the problem was solved.  We then had the Blue Service done by the dealer at 27,775 miles.  At this time we also had a problem with the sliding door latches were sticking.  They were lubricated at this time.  The latches still were sticking and they were replaced 29,947 miles.  We then noticed a noise like rattle from the front right side.  Our right front strut support was replaced at 30,506 miles.  My wife was driving during work hours when she turned the Sienna and the steering shaft and the steering column separated leaving the steering wheel spinning in her hands.  Could have been a tragic accident, fortunately no one was injured.  The dealer then reattached the steering collar and replaced the SQUIP CO.  What do you ask is the SQUIB?  When the steering collar came apart, the air bag was detached.  Rendering the bags useless.  If she was hit when the steering wheel separated, no air bag would have deployed.  This repair was done at 34,559 miles.  What is next?  Only time will tell.<br><br>
