            My '92 Subaru Legacy was a great vehicle for bombing around town in, and occasionally taking to locations that would be &quot;taboo&quot; for other cars.  I found the car to have more than enough pickup for a 4 cyl. vehicle.  The Boxer engine has worked well for Porsche over the years, and Subaru puts it to good use in this car by providing more than adequate pep for a sub-$25K offering.  I live in Minneapolis, MN and commute frequently to Duluth, MN (aka Snow Country) to visit family and friends.  This vehicle is very surefooted on roads of any condition, but it especially excels on snow and ice, even in heavy stop-and-go traffic.  The All Wheel Drive system is something that I believe Subaru was right to include in all of it's cars.  For those unfamiliar with AWD -- and I've seen several reviews here that say the car is a 4X4, which is quite different -- All Wheel Drive transfers the engine power to the wheels that are getting the best traction.  This differs from 4X4 because the power is more or less distributed equally to all four wheels which will cause some to spin while others are holding the road.

<b>Interior</b>

The interior was comfortable and well-designed.  I'm 6'3&quot; and was quite comfy even on long trips.  Friends however told me that they didn't like being &quot;stuffed&quot; into the back seat for any longer than a trip to the coffee shop.  My vehicle had cruise control buttons on the steering wheel which was quite convenient for long trips.  The instrument cluster provided adequate information on the vehicle's demeanor and had enough well-placed &quot;idiot lights&quot; to let the driver know if something was wrong.  Handy features in this car included One-Touch Up AND Down front windows which were great if you wanted to adjust the window but keeps your hands on the wheel, and a system that automatically shut off the headlights when the key was turned off.  That feature caused me to leave the lights on permanently and let the car shut them off, but since I classified the lights then as daytime running lamps, I got a small insurance discount.

<b>Exterior</b>

Subarus in my book have never looked that extraordinary, but they appear very sound and stable from the outside.  The 2000 models look to be styled more aggressively, and I feel that to be a long-deserved improvement.  My '92 (even in Minnesota) was not showing any signs of rust when I sold it in May '99.  I was quite happy with that fact, and how well the car cleaned up with a simple car wash.  Manually scrubbing underneath bumpers or other places wasn't needed like on some of my other vehicles.

<b>Maintenance</b>

My Legacy only had one major problem and that was the right front CV-joint going out.  It cost about $175 to have it replaced at a local non-Subaru garage, and they had the part in stock to take care of it.  Total time was about two hours to repair.

<b>Off-Road Capabilites</b>

I know Subaru sells their cars as SUVs, and I agree with that to a point.  I've had my '92 Subaru off-road on a few occasions.  Granted I wasn't out beating on it hard-core, but I've had it in mud up over the front bumper with no trouble.  My apartment building also flash-flooded a couple of years back and I decided I was going to head into the underground parking lot anyway. (What can I say? I wanted to see what it would do.)  The water was up to the base of the windshield but the car never griped.  Most impressively, it started up the next morning just as easily as always.  One other random experience where it proved itself (and ticked off my truck owning friends) was on glare ice on a dirt road.  The guys I was out with made the mistake of stopping in their 4X4 trucks and they couldn't get moving again unless people were literally pushing the truck along from the outside.  The way we ended up getting underway again was my car giving them a push back to dry pavement. 

My examples aside though, the Subaru should not be bought with the intention of rock-climbing to some remote campsite in the Rockies.  The car's AWD capabilities allow it to go to a few other places that a normal car shouldn't try, but it IS still a sedan.  In my mind, the Subaru would be classified as a &quot;partial-SUV&quot; but nothing more.  If you really want an SUV, the only correct choice is a HUMVEE, not anything that you'll find in a local dealer's showroom.<br><br>
