            My Oldsmobile Achieva, Beulah, is a 1993 and has 125,000 miles on it. Now, I am not afraid of buying used cars usually... and seem to have a knack for finding models that suit my purposes well... until now.

Beulah is a great car gas mileage wise, which is why I traded my beloved Geo Tracker in on her. I was driving to Denver monthly (or more) which round trip was averaging over 500 miles and I really needed not only a comfortable ride but somewhat economical one as well. I quickly found that I could make the trip on a tank of gas (or just over one tank if the wind was blowing which is most of the time).

However, I noticed that at a little over 100,000 miles all the plastic features inside and outside of the car started breaking. Knobs, seat latches, heater vents, door panel parts, license plate holder, speaker covers...the list goes on and on. And while I purchased PVC glue to try and repair what I could... at least superficially... but in all honesty I have just become more and more disheartened and for the most part have given up trying to fix them.

Engine-wise, Beulah has had the usual problems you'd expect from a 7 year old car... belts, the alternator, etc. Nothing I wouldn't expect or can't handle having fixed. She does have a slight attitude about downshifting into second... basically lugging and dying (it's an automatic... so you can't blame the driver *wink*) but I've found that if I can slow down enough to get it into first, it'll upshift into second and I am fine. Beulah and I made peace with it.

I love the look of the body... it's sleek and a tad sporty but not hotrod looking. And I really think the car will last many more miles engine-wise but I am not sure what to do about all my breaking parts inside. I guess either live with them breaking or get rid of the car. But can I really get rid of my Beulah???  I guess we'll see.<br><br>
