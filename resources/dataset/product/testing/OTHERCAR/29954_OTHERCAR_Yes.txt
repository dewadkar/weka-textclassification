            When we first started talking about getting a mini van I thought, &quot;I know I am getting old if my dream car is a mini van&quot;, now I wonder what we waited for!

It is much easier to get the kids in and out. No more back ache bending down inside the back seat to get that car seat latched properly. My caravan has &quot;car seat friendly&quot; seat belts that do not need the extra hook my car did. That makes it much easier to take them in and out with out hassle. The extra room is amazing, I can take my girl friend and her 2 kids somewhere with out an extra car. When people come to visit we can all go places together. My Caravan is pretty standard, but one good feature it has is the grocery bag hooks in the back. I can now get &quot;plastic bags&quot; without everything ending up all over the car by the time I get home. My kids love all the drink holders. They even have some that are for juice boxes. Also there are several small storage containers that the kids can put small toys in. That's nice for the long hauls. The seats come out in the back so you can put larger things like bikes in the back with one seat still in. They are very easy to get out.

It is so nice to ride &quot;up high&quot;. I can see much more in front of me then I could with my small compact car. I feel safer. I thought since it is much bigger then what I used to drive I would have a problem getting used to it. It may be bigger but it drives like a small car. The only thing that is hard to get used to is parking. I can't seem to get it strait in the lines. I am sure that will come in time.

One down side is that it is a gas gussler. But I was surprised, its not as bad as it could be. I get about 350 miles to the fill up, for about $22. Also, if you get the extra's it can be very expensive. We bought it new, but if you buy a few years old it can be more affordable. The Caravan is one of the better priced new mini vans, but it still makes for a big monthly payment if you are on a tight budget.
