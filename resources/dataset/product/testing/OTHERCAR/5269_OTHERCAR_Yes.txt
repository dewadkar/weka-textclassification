            After getting into a car accident with a car that I had, I needed to get something new...something I would feel safe in. I picked the Toyota 4runner.  I'm a truck kind of girl. Every time I look at my 4runner, I get all excited.  IT's very powerful.  
I haven't run into any major problems with my 4runner yet, and my dad is a mechanic, so I'd know if something went wrong. I have only done routine maintenence, like oil changes, and a timing belt change, which should be done every 60,000 miles with a Toyota anyways.  
My truck is a v6 SR5.  I get compliments on it all the time. A few more perks about owning this truck: it has a sunroof! And the sunroof is pretty big. I have power locks and windows. And the coolest thing? The back window where the tailgate is goes down! My 4runner is very roomy.  Another good thing about it is that it has 4 wheel drive, so I haven't gotten stuck in the snow with it yet! As for the radio, my truck came with a factory tape and cd player in one! The gas mileage isn't bad. Of course I go through more gas than I did with my little 4 cylinder car, but that is expected.  
I definitely recommend buying a 1993 4runner, or any year 4runner for that matter. You will not be disappointed. I don't plan on purchasing another vehicle anytime soon, but when I do, it'll be another 4runner for sure!
