            I purchased my Safari van in 1997 it was 2 years old, low mileage, it is nice a roomy.It seats comfortably at least 8 people. I gets good gas mileage. The two-rear bench seats are removable, as well as fold-down.

 It has moved households of  furniture. It is great for traveling driving the highways across America. It handles very comfortable. 

Mine has a luggage rack, tinted windows, the air conditioner is great, it actually gets cold, which is great in the California desert heat. I plan on purchasing another one when this one runs out. 

It has over 100 thousand miles now and is still running great. The interior is still in great shape. It handles very good even in stormy windy weather.

The one thing I would request in a new one, would be that all the seats would lay-down for sleeping.

The only problem I have had with mine, is the brakes, they always squeak, I have had them to different brake-shops and they still squeak. But other than that I have had no problems, except the air compressor went out, but the GMC warranty replace that at no cost to me. And the passenger seat leg room is very cramped, leg room needs to be wider.<br><br>
