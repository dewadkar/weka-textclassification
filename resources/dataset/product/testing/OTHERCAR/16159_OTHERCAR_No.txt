            I bought this car a year ago and have had nothing but problems. Yes, it was 13 years old, yes it was a rare import, but it was found at auction by a friend's dad and in such unbelievably pristine condition with such low miles, it cast an aura of invincibility around itself that beguiled me. It is basically a competent, though heavy-feeling car. The problems have centered on repair costs. I am used to driving Volvos, which although more expensive to repair than, say, a Ford, are fairly easy to work on and pretty reliable to begin with. This car, instead of being rock-solid like my previous Volvos, has a fragile feel to it, and having any work done at all is like having to pamper a foreign exotic. The electric fuel pump was $500 to replace! Exorbitant for what is essentially a gussied up, leather-clad Volkswagen. The idle speed is controlled by another, separate electric motor, which has always been temperamental, causing the car to surge and occasionally stall at idle, but its repair is just too expensive to even contemplate, so I live with it. A host of other, fleeting problems (my grandfather called them 'gremlins') plague this car-- the alarm system is touchy, the driver information center works when it feels like it--  I could go on. This is a shame, because this car at its essence is not bad. The ride is its best feature- very solid, like a BMW, but well-damped and comfortable. It's roomy inside without being unnecessarily large, the interior materials are first-rate, the paint is otherworldly in its glossiness-- definitely a conversation starter. What I don't understand is why this car, with its barely adequate 5-cylinder engine, is saddled with a pathetic 3-speed automatic! No overdrive, no lockup torque converter, just a 3-speed granny-tranny. Why?? Was it an intentional fingers-up to us Americans with our draconian speed limits? The loud, discordant powerplant is turning at 3000 rpm at 65 mph. This makes for tense highway cruising and really, really mediocre gas mileage-- about 23 on a good day. Wow, it really feels good to vent my spleen about this.
