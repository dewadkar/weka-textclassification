            I wanted a digital camera which would make quality pictures, easily sent &amp; stored, and easy enough for an amateur like me to use.  This is it!  It has special setting for taking many different kinds of pictures, including sunsets and even holiday lights.  The zoom is easy to use too, and it self focuses nearly as soon as you change the setting.  The discs are the same standard size as you already use in your computer, and, you can re-use them too!  Don't like the last set of pictures you took?  No problem!  Just delete them and start out fresh using the same disc.  Works great for making photo cards and greetings too.  I have only had this camera for a couple of months so far, but I'm still finding more ways to improve my pictures by experimenting with the different settings as different lighting and distances pop up in the indoor and outdoor pictures I take. Took some great detailed shots of fall trees too, and the colors are amazingly realistic.  The detailed booklet  which comes with the camera explains all the settings in easy to understand language so you will soon be taking photos like a pro.  If you don't have enough in your piggy bank for this one yet, it's definitely worth hoarding back for.  <br><br>
