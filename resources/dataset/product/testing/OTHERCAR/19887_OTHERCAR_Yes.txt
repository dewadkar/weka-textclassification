            We wanted a good quality digital camera to take photos while we travel, we did not know much about this technology, so we searched the trade journals and some of the information on the internet.  
We found that this camera was highly recommended by several editors.  So we made the purchase and we are glad that we did.  We also bought extra &quot;compact flash memory card&quot; so that we could store more pictures while traveling.  We did not want to bring along a computer to download the pictures.  
We can choose from 3 different qualities of photos and we can preview and review each shot if we wish.  We really like being able to review the photos on the TV screen too, it helps us to select which photos to print or erase. 
The only down side for us was that the batteries did not last very long, so we would recommend taking extra batteries or using the power cord that came with the camera.  
We would recommend this camera to anyone who would like good pictures using a small camera.<br><br>
