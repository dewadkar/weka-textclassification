            This is my third Dodge Caravan. The first was a 1989 Caravan SE Turbo...GREAT VAN,,,lots of power. Retired it in 1998 for a 1998 Caravan short model. Loved it but soon relized that we need more room.Since we ski we decided on a 1999 Grand Caravan SE AWD best move we ever made. All Wheel Drive is something else ! Goes through snow like you wouldn't believe !! I would recommend this to anyone who has to drive in the snow..I love it. By the way I am a loyal Dodge person. We have a total of 4 new Dodge vehicles in our family as of now. <br><br>
