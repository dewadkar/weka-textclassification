            While getting the bumper of my 99 Mercury Sable Station-wagon repaired after a fender bender, the other guy's insurance company rented me a 2000 Toyota Camry.

The first thing I noticed about the car was that it was a Toyota.  I was a little bit disappointed but it didn't look that bad, so I just hoped it didn't drive like a toy.

I was actually surprised at how easy it was to go from driving my big-assed station-wagon to driving this car.  It took a minute to get the feel of the accelerator and brake, both of which were a LOT more responsive than my car's.  But soon I was out in Atlanta traffic doing just fine and only had difficulty when it came time to change automatic gears (Drive to Park, etc.) because I kept spraying my windshield with wiper fluid and turning the wipers on because I'm used to the gear shift being on the steering column.

Comedy aside, the car and I did great on the Atlanta Perimeter during rush hour traffic and this is what I was worried about.  Turn signals, steering control, braking quickly enough, and even air bags in case I really screwed up.

There are a couple complaints that I have with the car as a permanent one:  the center-console thing has always bugged me.  You have the console-wall against your right foot when it's on the accelerator.  I like to have some space to stretch and maneuver.  The radio layout is poor.  I also hate the gear selector in the middle instead of on the steering column, but I suppose I could get used to it.

I didn't expect it, but I totally respect this car now and recommend it to anyone who may need to switch cars quickly and go out into dangerous traffic.
