            Let me start out by saying that I have recently been traumatized in a car accident. I was rear-ended by a careless teenager at high speeds. It was physically harmful and it made me think about safety in automobiles.

I loved my Ford and thought that my driving world was going to end without it. I wanted to keep it, but the structural integrity was gone, therefore I needed a safe car to turn to. When my parents were going to stick me with the Kia (yuck) I made a wild dash at getting a loan for a car. 
Being the picky girl I am, I decided that safety and looks were the priorities, and features were rather unimportant. I needed a car of a certain price range of 9,000 dollars to 12,000 dollars. This narrowed it down to a few good cars and a lot of really bad ones. To narrow my options to the best choices, I did some investigating. I looked all over the internet, asked around, and watched what everyone else was driving. 
Consumer Reports said that the Chevy Prizm, the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla had been the highest rated in their tested criteria. One of them that stood out the most was the crash tests. The Corolla and the Civic tied above the Prizm, so I chose to exclude the Prizm from my list. Since my budget was strict, I needed to keep my options open for a used car. 
Finally, the Corolla became the secondary in my two choices due to price. The civic was about two thousand dollars cheaper and smaller(less gas). So, I went to the dealership and looked around. I thought the sporty appearance of the newer model Civics was and excellent bonus! I looked only at used cars because I don't make enough money to live on my own, much less pay for a beast of a new car. 
I looked and looked, and I couldn't find any cars I wanted and could afford. They either didn't have disc breaks or they had dents in the body, or they were blue (bad luck in my family)... Just when I was about to walk off the lot, the dealer to me to a secluded parking lot, and I met Vito. Yes, I named my car. Laugh if you wish, but this is the coolest little thing I have ever driven! 
I test drove it, making sure I didn't appear giddy to the dealer. I slammed on the brakes to test if the car would shimmy or pull to either side. It surprised me, being so used to the larger Tempo, that the car stopped so fast and effortlessly. I gave my all to turn tight corners at higher than average speeds, and found that the nimble handling and reflexive steering were comfortable and made for a more confident driving experience. Upon my father's suggestion, I hit the gas pedal and played a bit with the engine. The car met all of my standards without complaint and I bought it. 
It's a little black, '97 HX two door. I can get up to forty miles per gallon on the highway and it has forty thousand miles on it.
My Civic is significantly quieter than the Kia, and I don't feel threatened by trucks anymore. 
I drive about a hundred and forty miles a day on the interstate, and this car is saving me twenty five dollars a month in gas! The radio sound quality is excellent, the headlights are bright and safe, and the windshield is sloped at a comfortable degree, unlike the Chevy Cavalier. 
In short, I love my buddy Vito. I now feel safe and I am starting to feel more at ease with being on the road after my accident. 
Oh, but there are a few things I have discovered through ownership. The engine cavity is roomy in most parts... but try to get your hand behind the left headlight, and you're toast. I had to remove the power-steering reservoir to be able to get my slight hands in there to pull the bulbs. Another thing is that the rear defrost only heats the lower half of the window, making visibility a minimum unless you scrape the entire thing before taking off. Let's face it, that is a pain in the gear shift when it is cold. 
I urge you to buy a six cylinder or a turbo. The high speed horses are low in the four cylinder engine. 
Anyone who wants to drive like a frickin' maniac on the road and victimize others with their careless driving shouldn't buy this car. The Civic is made for those of us who drive safely, and care if we hurt others with our stupidity. 
Those people who are broke out of their minds, want a safe car that doesn't drive like a Pinto and looks cool too, should buy a Civic. 
I am a satisfied customer, and have frequently recommended this car to friends and colleagues.<br><br>
