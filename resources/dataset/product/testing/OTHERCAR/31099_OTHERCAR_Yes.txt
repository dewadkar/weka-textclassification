            I use my jeep for Search &amp; Rescue. I have been on a Search &amp; Rescue team here in Ohio since 1992. I have used it to get into hard to reach places for searches and once to haul a found subject out to civilization. My Jeep's have never failed me. I am driving my fifth Jeep Cherokee. I guess you could say I am hooked. I started with a used full size monster 1979 Cherokee with a 401 cubic inch motor. I really liked it, but I got gallons to the mile with that one. After that I started with the scaled down size Cherokees and my last three have been Sport models with the 4.0L six-cylinder engine. I haven't had any problems with power especially with my latest 1997 one that has fuel injection. 

They have served my needs well to haul what I want and to go where I want. If you have a large family I wouldn't really recommend it unless you like being really close. If you have to haul large items like building materials or a boat or canoe then you will need the roof rack. Also I highly recommend the rear window wiper/washer. The first downsized one I bought had a problem with the seat back breaking twice. However that hasn't been an issue in the last three. I haven't really had any other major problems and hope I don't. Murphy you aren't listening are you? Sorry, I couldn't resist.<br><br>
