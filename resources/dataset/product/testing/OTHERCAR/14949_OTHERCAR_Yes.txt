            For starters i bought my camera about 2 years ago when it was around seven hundred dollars.It was worth every penny then and i would pay that price now. 

After i went through 2 different polaroid digital cameras, I was fed up , so finaly I bit the bullet and bought a mavica. I tell you now, the picture quality is amazing , and it is convinient too, the battery lasts long, also you dont have to mess around with connecting wires to your computer because of the floppy disk drive, which, as far as I know, only comes with this camera.

I list alot of items for sale on ebay, I also make websites and use this camera to take picture for them, the quality is always great even though this thing is over 2 years old.

I've reccommended this camera to over 10 people who bought it even though they were reluctant based on price. Not one of them is dissatified with their purchase.

Along with being great for auction listings and web-related work, it is also a good way just to take &quot;fun&quot; pictures (eg: family outings, your kids,ect.). Because at about 10 cents a floppy disk, you can get around 25 pictures on each, with the capability to rewiew and delete and photo you want....I think that is alot better than 5 bucks for a roll of film that half the pictures usually have peoples heads cut off.

All in all this camera is a great investmant, and if you are using it for selling purpases such as ebay, this thing will pay for itself with the 1st month you own it.

Seriously , if your thinking about buying a digital camera , dont think that just because a camera is cheap that it will be good ... believe me ive been down that road ... get the mavica , if you dont , youll be sorry , if you do , im sure youll thank me for it .<br><br>
