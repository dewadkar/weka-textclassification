            while the nissan 240sx in general is very reliable as all nissan models, and while it also will go for many miles, I learnt recently from a friend who is a mechanic that the 240sx has a constructional flaw in the fuel injectors. This flaw showed up at a friend&quot;s 1991 model who had to replace them twice and cost her a lot of money so far - otherwise she is very happy with the car.
My friend, the mechanic, told her that he replaces the fuel injectors in 240sx models ALL THE TIME, even in the later models.
Otherwise: nice car!<br><br>
