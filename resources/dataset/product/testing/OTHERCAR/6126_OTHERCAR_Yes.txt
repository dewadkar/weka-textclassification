            I recently purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Impala and let me tell you, it was the best purchase that I have ever made.  The new Impala is all luxury!!  The inside is very roomy.  My fiance is 6'3&quot;, and he raves about the leg and head room. Let's talk about comfort.  The seating is very pleasing.  The seats have adjustable lumbar support and power controls that allow you to find the perfect distance and height, which is important when you are 5'2&quot; like me.  I chose the white exterior and have been very pleased because of it's ability to hide the dirt.  The interior that I went with was blue and keeps much better than grey.  I was a bit unhappy with the seatbelts.  They are very comfortable to where, but if you need to change positions on a long trip, you have to unfasten the belt because the lap portion locks once it is buckled.  However, the trunk is WONDERFUL.  There is room enough for three or four suitcases.  The radio/CD player has been a real luxury as well.  And with dual air controls, you and your passenger can select the perfect temperature for your side of the vehicle.  I would highly recommend the 2000 Chevrolet Impala to just about anyone.  I do not have any children and the car feels quite sporty to me, however, there are three shoulder seatbelts in the back seat that have adjustments to fit children AND there are THREE carseat anchors that are fairly new to vehicles.   With this in mind, the 2000 Chevrolet Impala makes for a great family of business car as well.  I do recommend shopping for deals.  I purchased a $23,000 car at $19,100 by waiting for a sale.  <br><br>
