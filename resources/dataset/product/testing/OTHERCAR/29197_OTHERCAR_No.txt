            When I moved to the States eight months ago I started looking for a reliable and affordable car. My first choice would have been a Honda Accord, but as a newbie in a foreign country you can't spend all your money to buy a car. That's why I decided to purchase a '99 Dodge Neon Highline 4 door (Sport Edition).Within the first week a brought the car back to the dealer to let them check the engine. They told me that the engine performs very well. I tested other models and yes, the engine performance is all the same - terrible.When I reach 50 mph the steering wheel starts shaking and rattling and sometimes when I start the engine there are weird sounds. When you turn on the A/C you will loose almost all engine power. The seats are build to comfort you for short trips, but turn into hell driving for hours or days.Also the transmission shifts very hard.The only advantage of this car is the interior, the stereo system and the low price.But quite frankly, next time I will spend more money and buy a real good car - a Honda.<br><br>
