              I bought my 1997 Camaro Z-28 used in 1999, with 50,000 miles on it.  I have previously owned 2 other Camaros, and a mustang, and will forever be a Camaro fan.  I think the Car has an aggressive styling, a very sporty passenger compartment, and the power to blow away other unsuspecting motorists.
  I traded in my 1994 Z-28 for the 1997 Z-28, which I currently own, for one reason, the options.  My 1994 had power windows and that was about it, the 1997 has T-tops, Leather interior, power seats and power windows, and a redesigned interior with 4 cup holders, 3 more than the 1993-1996 models.  
  I absolutely love the T-tops, even though they are not as convenient as the convertible top, I find no trouble taking them off quickly before I leave.  The power of the Camaro is impressive, when you pull up to the kid with the mustang, and you are down the street before he knows the light even turned green. The suspension is tight and handles nicely around turns, although making a sharp 90* right is sometimes difficult, but that is most likely just my driving style.
  There are a few problems I should address, and they would include rattling from the trunk/spare tire compartment.  This is not a car you would want to drive in snow, even though the weight seems to be more evenly distributed than the 1985 Z-28 I drove, it is still a rear wheel drive car, and the tires will slip despite the traction control.  Also be careful changing the engine coolant, there is a process which the owners manual outlines, and if it is not followed, you may end up with a burnt out water pump, and very bad fish smell.
  I recommend this car to any driver who seeks fun and excitement out of their vehicle.  The Camaro is a legend already and I hope that in the future it will only get better.  I will always be a customer.
