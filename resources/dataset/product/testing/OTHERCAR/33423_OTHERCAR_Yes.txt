            I purchased my Jetta at the end of October 1999, only a couple weeks after they had even been released.  I was nervious about buying a brand new model at first, but my fears were unfounded.

The car is sporty and fun to drive, though all trims, in 99, suffered from a soft suspention.  This makes it a dream to drive on the Interstate and though town, but if you drive more aggressivly (such as myself) the soft suspention leads to excessive body roll.

At 6 foot tall I find the Jetta one of the few smaller cars that I feel comfortable driving.  Though taller occupants may not be as comfortable.  My friend who is 6'4" has to push the passanger seat all the way back and even then it looks like he'll get his kneecaps blown off if the passanger airbag goes off.

The backseat isn't comfortable for adults for long drives.  Even going to lunch your buddies might give you grief for the cramped leg room.

The trunk is massive and you can fit a great deal in there.  The mouth of the trunk is pretty good sized though I have run into problems with it being too small a couple times.  Put it this way, you're never going to fit a new TV back there, even a small 19".  Though there would be room if you could get it in.

The 2.0L engine is sportier and more powerful than its 115HP spec. would seem to indicate.  The car can be driven hard and it responds with reasonable power.  After all this IS just a 4 cylinder engine, not a V8.

The five speed manual transmission seems inadiquate even for the 2.0L engine.  At 80MPH you'll be hitting 4000 rpm in 5th gear.  Of course most people won't be driving much faster than this. *guilty grin*

Maintainance has been reasonable and normal.  I use synthetic oil and premium fuel and the car has been very good to me.  46,000 mile so far with no major problems.
