     I live in southern Maine, USA.  I have a quarter-mile of dirt road to travel plus a long driveway before reaching my house.  We don't normally get as much snow as you may think, but our road can become impassible.  The plow can't always come when we want it to.  Having 4-wheel drive increases the chances we'll be able to get up and down our road and decreases our dependancy on the plow service a bit.  That's the biggest reason I have a 4x4 Tracker and not a mini-van.  Where do you live and what are your expectations for the next vehicle you're considering to buy or lease?

     At times I get a little tired of my Tracker's somewhat  bouncy truck-like ride when it's going over bumpy or uneven roads.  For this reason, I would Not recommend this vehicle to anyone that doesn't like trucks, jeeps, or that has no experience with them.  It is possible you could test drive a Tracker on good roads, love the smooth ride, and not realize what you're about to buy is closer to a jeep than a car.  On the contrary, if you are a truck or jeep lover, but hate the high cost of fueling the average truck or jeep then the Tracker may be perfect for you.  Further, the Tracker's handling at times can feel a bit sports car-ish but you have to remember that it's not a sports car and can be rolled over more easily than the average car.  

    I've seen statements made about a lack of power in the 4 cylinder Tracker.  My Tracker could "use" the "extra" power of a 6 cylinder engine.  But, when I think of the  money I'm saving by getting 23-25 mpg with my 4 cylinder I'm glad that's all I have.  Plus, sometimes I like to hear those 4 cylinders and 16 valves really working!  The transmission even offers a "power" mode that helps take  advantage of the power you can get from the engine's higher rpm range.  Normal mode is fine most of the time and probably saves a little gas.  The bottom line is, I'd "like" the added power of a 6 cylinder but unless they find a way to improve the gas mileage, my 4 cylinder will be fine.  I haven't towed anything yet but hope to in the future.  I wish I could tow more than the maximum 1,500 lbs but when I consider my budget I'm glad that's all it will let me tow!  

     I also wish I had a couple more inches of cargo space and an inch or two more knee room for the rear seat.  But, there is a lot of versatility as far as folding down seat backs and putting some cargo on the roof racks.  Plus when I get my tow hitch I could get a little trailer.  In general, seat comfort is very good.  I am thinking about trying to find a replacement for my headrest which I feel pushes forward slightly too much some times but it's not a major issue.

     **Update 4-10-01**, The interior and especially rear seat room are now bigger issues since our infant daughter needs her Evenflo Discovery Car seat installed in the back seat.  My wife and I are both nearly 6 feet tall and to make a long story short, we all just barely fit now, even with the car seat in the middle of the rear seat.  At this point we need to find a larger 4x4 to be our primary vehicle and the Tracker will be a second vehicle.

     One of these days I look forward to doing a little bit more off-roading with the Tracker but not much.  Due to the Tracker's small size and special low gear it is extra maneuverable but it's not made for the real yucky or rough stuff, at least not without buying or doing a few modifications.   
     
     Depending on my budget and how long I live here, I may keep this Tracker forever.. it all depends.  All in all, it's a Very good little truck.

     Update: Nov. '02.  Just a few months ago, we traded the Tracker in on a 2002 Blazer LS.  The increased room and power of the Blazer for a relatively small increase in monthly-payment was an opportunity we couldn't pass up.  Yes, I do miss the fuel economy of the Tracker and the Tracker was a little easier to park in tight spaces, but otherwise, the Blazer is better for us.
