            My wife and I shopped and researched for weeks, looking for a smaller car to replace our Mazda Protege. Our choice came down to either another 2000Protege or a Saturn. Lets just say after a bad trip to the local Mazda dealership we found our selves at the Saturn dealership and never regretted our decision. The dealership was everything they say they are...very clean, very professional and extremely helpful...not pushy. Instead of the smaller SL series, we chose the larger LS model.
We love it. Great styling, (it has the rear spoiler, very respectable performance and handling, nicely laid out interior and a very impressive audio system. We bought the LS1 with all the options, including the leather interior and premium sound system. The tan interior along with the gold exterior looks a lot more expensive and luxurious than what we paid for it,($22,000 or so). We will be recommending this car to any and everyone we see. <br><br>
