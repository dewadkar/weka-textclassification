            I bought my KIA in October of 2001 with only 60 miles on it. By the time the car had 3,000 or 4,000 miles on it the brakes started squealing rather loudly and have ever since. We were told that's just the way the KIA brakes do because of the materials from which they are made.

We've had them oiled a few times, but the horrible squealing returns.

The car is rather sluggish on take-off, especially after sitting for an hour or so, or overnight. Pulling out into traffic can be hazardous during busy times because the car wants to stall a bit before the gas finally kicks in and gets it going. I would not recommend this car to people who have children (for safety reasons) or to people who get in a hurry when driving in traffic. It doesn't have much pedal power when you're pulling out, so you want to make sure you have ample time. The dealership where we bought the car hooked it up to a diagnosis machine, but they can't find anything wrong with it that would cause the hesitation. For them to find the problem, the car would have to perform poorly for them at the time they drive it, and you know how that goes! It never does that when you take it in to them.

We've tried to trade the car in, but dealers don't seem to want to take it on a trade, including the dealership where we bought it. We were told by several dealers that the "KIAs take too much of a hit, so they depreciate between $4,000 and $6,000 once you drive them off the lot. Every dealer wanted us to give them between $4,000 and $6,000 to take it on a trade-in. I wouldn't recommend this car to the cost-conscious either. We've lost a lot of money buying that car.
