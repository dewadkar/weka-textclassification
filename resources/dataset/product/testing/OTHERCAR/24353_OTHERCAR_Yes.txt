            I had to learn about this way just as my title implies : my father was going through a midlife crisis at the age of 46, and he had somehow got his one track mind set on the fact that <i>&quot;I wanna get one of those little BMW's one day...I like the boxier ones, not so much the new ones..&quot; -- &quot;Right, dad&quot;</i>, I'd say, exiting the room as fast as humanly possible. For some reason the ole' 89 Toyota Pickup wasn't good enough for Dad. He wanted, as he would say, <i>&quot;Some balls under the hood&quot;</i>.

Contrary to my belief, I came home one night, and he had actually bought it. It was a 1989 Black BMW 325i, with a sunroof and a manual transmission. I couldn't wait to test drive this puppy. Before this car I had never driven a manual transmission V6, (only my four cylinder), and I had never driven a BMW at all, actually.

This thing crapped all over my 1986 Toyota Celica. I sat down to take it for a test drive one day (dad went out for the day with mom, and I found the spare keys...hehe), and it was amazing. The manual tranny shifts like butter, and the inline six under the hood was letting me do things that I had never dreamed possible in my go-kart of a car. If you wind out the gears to 4 or 5 thousand RPMs before shifting (with the exception of first gear), this baby takes off. The 167 horses under the hood helped me tear up the local highway, as well as embarrass some moron in a Mustang that tried to beat me off the line with his automatic.

As for the features on the inside, I really only have one complaint - the radio. The standard Anti-Theft BMW cassette/stereo that comes with this car doesn't get loud. At all. I like my cars fast, and my 311 music LOUD, and although this car hauled some serious @ss, not having the 311 pumping loud with the windows open was a minus. The sunroof is a manual crank sunroof, but it isn't hard to use. A couple turns and it's open, with really no strength needed. The air conditioning works great in the summer, and the fog lights will light up the night like you have never seen in any other car. (The high beams in this car are really really nice).

All in all, we have had this car for a little over a year now with no problems. We take it for oil every 3,000 miles as you should with any other car, we fill it with premium, and it runs like a dream. 

Having a mid-life crisis? Get a 325i and leave your problems far behind you on the road.<br><br>
