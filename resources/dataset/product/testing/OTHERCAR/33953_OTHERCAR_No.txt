It has been 3 and 1/2 years since I bought my New Beetle. While I still like the car a lot, it has given me more trouble than I ever thought it could.

Here's a mostly complete summary of the problems I've had:

In 1998:

- The shift diagram on the shifter fell off, and the center piece of one of the alloy wheels had cracked. The dealer replaced both, under warranty.

In 1999:

- The check engine light came on. It turned out to be the glow plug relay, which was a recall I knew about. Dealer replaced under warranty.

- At the 12 month checkup and oil change, the driver's side power window switch wouldn't go up or down automatically anymore. Dealer replaced the switch under warranty.

- The car almost overheated. The coolant fan thermal switch had to be replaced (under warranty).

- Replaced a blown low-beam headlight.

In 2000:

- Replaced plastic coating on the door runners, which was bubbling. Under warranty.

At this point, the bumper-to-bumper warranty expired. Unless noted, I had to pay for everything beyond this point.

- Driver's side window switch broke again. Had it replaced.

- Passenger side window fell off of its track. Had it repaired.

In 2001:

- Battery exploded. Had the engine compartment cleaned and the battery replaced.

- Both headlights went out within about a month. In one, the headlight was replaced, and in the other, wiring was repaired.

- Had the hood latch break.

In 2002:

- One headlight went out, again because of wiring

- The hood latch broke again.

In addition to the above issues, the biggest problem I've had with the car has been a reduction in power with the engine. It occurred gradually, so it took me some time before I was even sure there was a problem. I took it to an independent shop and two separate dealerships two separate times before I got the problem resolved. To fix the problem, I had to have:

- the turbo replaced (under warranty)
- the mass air flow sensor replaced
- the diesel intake manifold thoroughly cleaned. It was full of carbon.
- wiring on the ECU repaired.

All of the engine work cost me a total of over $1400, and I won't even go into the problems I had with one of the local dealerships.

Once I got it back from the last set of repairs, it ran like I first bought it. Now, three months later, I'm noticing a reduction in power again.

I love the design of the New Beetle, and I was originally very impressed with the engineering behind the TDI. But I have been very disappointed because of the numerous problems I've had.

Original Review

I first got on the waiting list for a New Beetle back in April of '98. I got my Cyber Green TDI in July of '98. Now that I've owned my Beetle for over a year, I still love the heck out of it!

The Engine:
I did a lot of research on the TDI before I bought it. It really is a revolutionary engine -- it provides excellent torque, great gas mileage, and very low emissions for a diesel. The TDI definitely has a lot of pep at low speeds. I've never had a problem tackling hills with it. It's also great on the highway for two reasons: 1) the engine is actually quite quiet on the highway, because the TDI is geared lower than the gas engine, so the RPM's are lower, and 2) the cruise control on this puppy is great! It holds your speed very accurately. In addition to all of that, the gas mileage is superior. I'm consistently getting around 45 mpg with a combination of city and highway driving.

The Exterior:
All of the Beetle colors are great. Some of them stick out for those that want to stick out, and some of them are more traditional but still great (like the white and the black). The styling speaks for itself.

The Interior:
I really like the way the interior lights up with blue and red at night. All of the interior controls (heating, AC, stereo) are easy to get to and intuitive. The seats are very comfortable -- I've had a few long raod trips in my Beetle (about 8 hours), and the seats have felt very supportive.

Little Stuff:
1) With the automatic windows, you can roll the windows up and down using your key in the outside door locks. I didn't know this before I bought my Beetle.
2) You can have your Beetle program to automatically lock the doors at about 10 mph.

I've had a few minor problems with my Beetle, but they've all been covered by the 2 year bumper-to-bumper warranty. Overall, I think I'll be very happy with my New Beetle for many years to come.
