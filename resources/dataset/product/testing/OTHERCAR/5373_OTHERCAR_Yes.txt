            I have been driving a Nissan Sentra ever since I got my driver's license.  I have also driven several other cars by other manufacturers and none of them come close to this car.

This car provides one of the smoothest rides I have ever taken.  It is compact, powerful, and has a very tight turn radius.  I can not say enough good things a bout this car.

Compared to other cars this car is definitely the best in its division.  It is reasonably priced and in my opinion can outperform any car that Ford or Toyota can put out with the same price-tag.  I would recommend this car to anybody who is looking for a good reliable car for themselves or their family.<br><br>
