            The name Corolla has lasted long and so do the cars but my Corolla is the 2000 Corolla CE 4-sp Automatic transmission. This is my car because its cheap. 125 hp makes it weak but 37 mpg makes up for that. This is a very quiet car and so is the ride. Don't ever attempt autocross in this car because the suspension is so soft that you'll notice that the car is never really level but always leaning to one side but the 2001 Corolla does have a new stabilizer bar in the rear which should help. 4-sp Automatic does the 1/4 mile in 17.9 seconds. Slow! Any guy would like the 5-sp manual which does the 1/4 mile in 16.6 second. Comparable to other more expensive cars. Faster than any Civic lower than the Si but cheaper. Also is faster than the 140 hp Integras. It has a great turning radius which really helps get out of jams and the small car itself gets through small openings.

No CD player on all models. No tachometer on automatic, cruise control, or ABS on the CE or VE. Not much room in the back seats unless everyone is small but there is a huge trunk. 

Runs like a luxury car. Steering gives some response but the wheel is not stiff. The soft suspension means super comfort ride. 

I recommend the car because its Toyota and every Toyota experience I've had is very good and long life. Though for cheap thrills get a Sentra SE. But... do you trust Nissian?<br><br>
