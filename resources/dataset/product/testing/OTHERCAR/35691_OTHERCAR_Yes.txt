               <b>R</b>eintroduced for 1992 and continued tell 1999 for that generation, the Bonneville SSEi is a member of GM's H-body full size family sedans, sharing its inner structure with the Oldsmobile 88 and Buick Lesabre and has the same powertrain as the Grand Prix GTP.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


      <b>The 1998 Bonneville SSEi</b>, despite being quite large, handles very well. With its relatively firm suspension, and wide 60 series tires, the Bonneville SSEi is fun to drive through the turns at high speeds, yet can get a bit scary if you don't respect this car's <b>handling</b> limitations. 
The big 60-series tires provide excellent grip, good damping, and accurate suspension geometry. The '98 Bonneville is no Ferrari, however for a full sized family sedan it is quite impressive. Even though handling is good, the strongest attribute of the Bonneville SSEi is 

<b>acceleration</b>. 
The Supercharged 3.8 liter OHV V6 makes this one of the quickest sedans offered from GM for the 1998 model year. With a 0-60 MPH estimated time of 6.9 seconds, this makes the 1998 Bonneville SSEi faster than the 1998 300M, the 1998 Taurus SHO, and the BMW 328i. Top gear acceleration is excellent too. 
Hills are a snap, the 4-speed automatic transmission hardly ever has to down-shift while climbing up steep grades at high speeds. 
The Bonneville is also very quiet. The only time this sedan makes any major noise is under hard acceleration. The supercharged engine can clearly be heard through the dual pipes. This husky, throaty noise from the exhaust is music to most SSEi's owner's ears.

<i>About the engine:</i> 

  Powering all Bonneville's are the 3800 series II 3.8 liter OHV V6's. Based on a Buick design, it may seem old fashioned, being a cast iron, pushrod unit with two valves per cylinder. However, with an Eaton supercharger, it gives the SSEi levels of performance that rival many V8s. With the blower, plus sequential electronic fuel injection, electronic spark control, and a coil for each cylinder, it pushes out 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. In naturally asperated (without the supercharger) forms, the Bonneville still produces a healthy 200 horsepower.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the Bonneville is very roomy. The dash looks a bit dated, but there is a plethora of useful gauges easily accessed by the driver. The seats are supportive and comfortable. My test car's leather seemed a bit cheap, with some wear already taking place at an odometer reading of 54,000 miles. Amenities include, power everything, including power antenna, and mirrors, there are automatic headlamps, fog lamps, passenger and driver airbags, 4 wheel disc brakes, and a meaty, leather wrapped steering wheel.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> looks huge, and is a 'love it, or hate it' design. I personally think it's quite the ugly ducking, but beauty is, of course, in the eyes of the beholder. The front grille is not too bad looking, it's actually the only part of this cars appearance that I like. The large fog lamps add an extra sporty touch. The side view design gives the Bonneville a 'boat like' appearance. The rear has curvaceous tail lamps, A little too curvaceous if you ask me. There is a modest spoiler, and 16" aluminum wheels.

<i>Price:</i>

 Although a controversial design, at $29,000 new, the 1998 Bonneville SSEi packs a tremendous value punch, and has decent levels of equipment. Today a 1998 Bonneville SSEi can be had for close to $15,000. The 3.8 powertrain set-up in this car has been very reliable for very many people. This review is based on only a 20 mile test drive, so I can not comment on reliability on a personal level. Like I mentioned before, the leather seats already showed wear at 3 years of age, so you might want to check with <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b> before buying this vehicle.
