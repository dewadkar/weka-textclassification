            Last year I was fortunate enough to acquire a Geo Prizm (blue/green).  I have not had a problem with it since, even though it was used.  Also, everyone always tells me what a good looking car it is, and I have to admit that they are right.  
It is very easy to drive (my husband had no trouble learning to drive standard on it), and gets great gas mileage, from 30 to 35 mpg.  It handles well in the rain and snow, making for a good year-round vehicle.  The trunk and back seats are roomy, allowing for lots of extra cargo. Also, it includes both driver and passenger airbags.
I enjoy every single mile that I drive in my prizm.
Anyone who wants a nice looking, economical car should buy one because they are so reliable.  I think that this would be the ideal car for a first driver, and also someone who is on the road a lot because it is so easy to drive and comfortable.  A must have for college students.
