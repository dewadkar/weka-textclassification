            My mother has purchased seven Volvo's in a row, starting back in her college days (she was smart).  This just shows you one families loyalty to the Swedish car maker, as many other safe families can attest.  You probably know that the only vehicle that is safer to be has to be the presidential limosine carrying that Bubba character from good ole Arky.  The Volvo is now in the ranks of Beamers, Mercedes, Lexuses, and Jags, all lines of luxury cars.  The thing that distinguishes Volvo is their impecable safety requirements.  They are light years ahead of the government regulations.  If safety is your first priority, the purchase of any Volvo should be a no brainer.  They are also getting sleaker designs every year.  The only drawback would be there exceleration from a stand still.  I am sure the Turbo models negate this problem.  Other than that minimal complaint, the Volvo is the ideal family car.  <br><br>
