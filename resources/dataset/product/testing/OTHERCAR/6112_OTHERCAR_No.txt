            I had the opportunity to test drive the new Impala  last weekend and was somewhat impressed with this vehicle. In fact, I liked it so much I ALMOST bought one.  However, ALMOST is as far as I got. Let me explain. This car is beautiful...until you climb inside!  True to Chevies of the past, the Impala's interior does NOT match the quality of the exterior (I'll ignore the AWFUL alloy rim design).  You basically have two options when choosing an interior on this car; bench or bucket seats. If you go with the buckets, the shifter is on the floor and you get a very nice console. However, the seats are not ergonomic, are very uncomfortable, and give the appearance of a 70's Chevy. On the other hand, the bench is designed nicely, but the shifter is on the column and you get NO console. Plus, the cup holders flip out of the armrest, are very flimsy, and the sweat from a drink drips on the seat. VERY poor design. The rest of the interior is plain and does nothing to excite me as a buyer. When will Chevy figure out that consumers want a nice interior to go with a nice exterior?!  Too bad; I would've loved to have driven one home. Instead, I opted for the smaller, but better apportioned, Olds Alero. Bottom line: If you don't care about the interior, this is a great car.<br><br>
