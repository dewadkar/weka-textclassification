            There are a few things to look for when you buy a digital camera. 
1. The memory it can handle for photos (i.e. number of photos) 
2. How many megapixels are the photos (i.e. quality of photos) 
3. The dimensions of the photos (i.e. sizing for enlargements) 
4. Zoom features 
5. Photo Snapshot Delay 
6. Bonus Features 
7. Print Quality of Photos 
8. Battery Drain 
9. Download features 

Features: 
3.34 megapixel resolution; 
340 mb microdrive; 
3x optical zoom 2x digital zoom 

Memory: 
The Casio QV-3000plus is great for that long vacation trip. It uses standard size flash cards that come in 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, and 64 mb. But the best part is that it can also use the IBM microdrive. It has so much memory, 340mb or so. You can take around 300 extremely high quality photos, and if you want to take more you can take over 1000 lower quality photos, which are still fantastic quality. You'll never have to buy memory again after this camera. This is by far the best feature of the camera. 

Megapixels: 
The camera will take photos at 3.34 megapixels. Most digital cameras will be around 2 megapixels. What this means is that the quality of the photos are higher. This allows you to enlarge your photos without losing as much quality as a 2 megapixel camera. Not only that but the camera takes in more color information. That in turns leads to more detail in your photos. 

Photo Dimensions: 
The photo dimensions range from 2048 x 1536 to 1024 x 768. With a larger photo dimension you can take photos and enlarge them without any notice of photo derogation. Most lower end cameras only reach 1024 x 768 

Zoom Features: 
The only problem with this camera is that it only offers standard zoom features. If you like taking pictures of the outdoors this is not a great camera. The pictures will look good, but you'll have to get close to your picture subject. It takes great outdoor photos but your subjects can't be any further then 50 yards if you want to see them at all. The nice thing is that since the photo quality of the camera is very high going into a digital zoom does little to degrade the quality of your photo. Most other cameras with a digital zoom will ruin the sharp quality of the optic zoom. 

Photo Snapshot Delay: 
The photo snapshot delay on the camera is not that bad. Most cameras need to take a ten second rest in between shots. This camera will only take a 5 second rest. 

Bonus Features: 
A great bonus feature of the cameras is creating panoramic photos. You can even turn these panoramic photos into 360-degree photos. The software provided allows you to create these photos with QuickTime, which is a wide standard in the multimedia community. This is a good camera if you're a real-estate dealer. The 360-degree photo gives a great online presence when trying to sell a house. Other features are making quick movies. If you like to fool around with small funny video clips this camera will help you do that. The camera also has other bonus features but to get them they are a bit more technical. 

Print Quality of Photos: 
The print quality is nothing short of amazing. We have a cheap Epson 860 color printer, which costs us 140 dollars. When we printout enlarged photos on the printer on photo quality paper, you can't tell that it��s a computer printout. Notice that I said enlarged photos. We print photos that are 11 x 8.5 and can't tell the different. 

Battery Drain: 
Battery Drain is a problem. You need to do one of two things. Get lithium batteries or rechargeable batteries. The camera has a normal life span compared to other cameras but if you wind up taking a few hundred photos by the end of the day you'll need those lithium batteries. You can take up to 1000 photos with flash before the batteries die. Lithium batteries are about two to three times as expensive as normal alkaline batteries but they last 5 times longer. The next solution is rechargeable batteries. This is good but only if you remember to recharge them. 

Download features: 
The camera has a USB port, which is very nice. Some high-end digital cameras don't even have this! To download the whole drive will take about 5 minutes. That's 340mb of info or over 300 photos. Plus the software that comes with the camera is great because all you have to do is plug it in and it'll auto sense the camera and start downloading (after the initial software install). 

Overall: 
This is a good overall camera. It has nice features that set it apart from the rest. But the only downside is the price. The microdrive is half the price. My advice is, if you like to take photos and send them to friends over email and such plus have the money get this camera.
