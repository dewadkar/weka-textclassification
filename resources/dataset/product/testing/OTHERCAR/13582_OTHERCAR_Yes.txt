            We bought this little car 5 months ago because we are moving out of the country in a couple weeks and needed a "throw-away" that we could pay cash for and sell or donate before we leave.  

I bought it off a young college kid for $500 and immediately put another $900 into it to make it safe enough to cart my three kids around in.  We didn't do anything to the engine but it needed all new brakes and axle rods.  It had 172000 miles when I bought it and has run like a champ for five months!  We have put over 3000 miles on it in that time and I have to say I am very impressed.  There are a couple bugs that if I were to keep it I would definitely fix...the struts are the main thing...its a very bumpy ride as it is now.  It is also burning oil but so far hasn't affected the overall engine performance.  She always starts right up and has never stalled on us (knocking on wood...I still have two and a half weeks to go!).  Also, I don't think that anything major has been done to the car because the kid that owned it had maintenance records for himself and the owner before him who was the original owner. The only thing that had been replaced was the muffler.

<b>The Details:</b>

<b>1988 Nissan Sentra E Wagon 4D</b>
<b>Engine:</b> 4-Cyl. 1.6 Liter
<b>Trans:</b> 5 Speed Manual
<b>Drive:</b> Front Wheel Drive
<b>Color:</b> Silver

<b>The exterior</b> of the car is decent looking.  I mean its 14 years old and still looks "cool" enough to not totally embarrass my kids to be seen in.

<b>The interior</b> is worn pretty bad in the front.  Rips in the seats but no coils or springs poking out and nothing that some cool looking seat covers couldn't hide.  The back seats are nice and roomy.  One of the back seats folds down for more hatch room.  Because this is a <i>wagon</i>, there is no trunk, but the hatch area is <b>HUGE</b>!  I can get our whole family of five, two weeks worth of groceries and a Radio Flyer wagon in this car no problem!  We had a 2000 Dodge Caravan right before this that didn't have half the room this little Nissan does.  Sometimes I feel like its one of those "Clown cars"...you know the tiny cars that like a dozen clowns magically fit inside.  It looks so tiny on the outside it must look strange to see my whole family go in and out of it. 

One thing that a person with children might consider is that the back seat belts are only lap belts and have no shoulder straps.  There are three seat belts though in the back which works out perfect for me.  The previous owner had a pull-out stereo that he took with him so I can't say anything about the original sound system except that there is a nice big hole where one ought to be.

<b>To Summarize</b>:

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone as an <i>"around town"</i> car but not as a long distance commuter as its just too old and has too many miles already.  It has served us well these five months and I am confidently passing it along to a friend of mine who will use it to get to school and back.  She will replace the struts and have the oil burning problems repaired as well as replace hoses and belts.  Our mechanic has said that another $600 would make the car <i>"right as rain"</i>.
