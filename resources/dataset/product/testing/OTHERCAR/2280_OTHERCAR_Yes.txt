            I was looking for a digital camera and after a considerate amount of time, I chose the PDR-M3.  I bought the camera quite cheap ($330 electrified.store.com) because it was refurbished, but I have yet to find any problems with it.  I wanted a digital camera because I'm a computer person, thus into digital pictures for webpages, and for my own digital gallery. I plan to make a and sort all my pictures on a CD-ROM.  I am not a big fan of prints, and I like editing pictures since I have reasonable knowledge doing so.

I'll talk about the camera first and then its image quality.  The camera is quite large and bulky. It has a lens cap that isn't that convenient but it doesn't bother me much.  It takes time to start up (5 secs) and to wait between shots.  The LCD screen is useless in bright sunlight, however there is a lens viewer which is pretty accurate and saves on battery.  The serial port transfer of files is painfully long.  However, I bought a USB smart media reader(must buy) which reads and transfers pictures from the memory cards in a flash.  This method also allows me to bypass using their terrible software(must not use).  No problem for me since I'm familiar with photoshop.

As for image quality, at first I was shocked with the bad quality, but after changing the default settings, pictures turned out great.  I now use the highest resolution and finest quality for all my shots.  I find it pointless to buy such a high quality and resolution camera if you're not going to take pictures at that quality and resolution.  Because pictures at higher quality and resolution take up more space, there is a need to buy extra smartmedia cards.  Pictures are real nice in most lighting situations.  I found pictures to be grainy and dark in cloudy outdoors, but I am pretty sure a force flash can correct that.  Most image problems I've had, I'd figured out a way to fix. I have yet to venture all the way into the manual mode which should allow you to take nice pictures in almost any environment.  The 3x optical zoom is awesome. This and the great-long-lasting-rechargeable-lithium-ion-battery made me choose this camera over the PDR-M1.

I feel that complete beginners of photography and electronics should stay away from this, but anyone with a little experience should have no problems using this camera.<br><br>
