Okay, there are two points I need to make before I rant about the Intrepid.

1) My father bought his '93 Intrepid two years ago.
2) He didn't let me drive it until this summer, after my own car (a Pontiac 6000 LE) died.

There are many things I like about the Intrepid. It is very responsive when you step on the accelerator or brake. It has power seats that are easy to adjust if different drivers are sharing the car. It has a great dash-- lots of gauges and lights so you know exactly what is going on temperature-wise, mileage-wise, etc.

There are more things, however, that I dislike about this car. Number one, the air conditioning belt makes a scary screeching noise whenever the climate control system is turned on. Secondly, the horn is not easy to find when you need to use it-- for instance, if one of my neighbor's dogs is in the road, I can't honk the horn in time to warn them... so I have to slam on the brakes instead. When the horn is found, finally, it makes a very wimpy noise that couldn't scare a butterfly. The other annoying thing is the dimness of the headlights-- if you want to be able to see at all, you should have your brights on, even on gray days. Unfortunately, at nighttime, you can't always do that, so you have to squint all the way to your destination.

In conclusion, there are more annoyances with the Intrepid than with any other car I've driven... Don't buy one.<br><br>
