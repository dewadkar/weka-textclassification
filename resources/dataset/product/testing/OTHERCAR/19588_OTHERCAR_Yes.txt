            My decision to purchase a 99 suburban was based solely on size and resale value. I had looked at every SUV.. Land Rover, Expedition, Land Cruiser to name a few and wasn't satisfied with amount of space in the middle seats as I was with the suburban.  I was able to sit comfortably and could even cross my legs. At 6'2&quot; I appreciated that. I was also impressed with the modular functions of the seats and being able to remove the back seats. 
The drive was very spongy at first but I have since put a suspension lift that has made it even more dreamy.
Kids and Suburbans go hand in hand! I have 2 kids and the extra space is loved!
