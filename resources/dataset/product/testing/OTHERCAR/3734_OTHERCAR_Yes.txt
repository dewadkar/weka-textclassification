            After extensive research of Ford, Dodge, Toyota and Chevy The Silverado won my choice of full size trucks. I had to take in account What I was using this truck for, Family travel, Work and Pleasure. Some of the factors that made my choice easy were as follows... 
The extended cab on the Chevy 4-door overall had more room than Ford or Dodge, With the split bench I can seat 6 people comfortably. The back seat can fold up for added cargo space. The MPG is better on the Chevy with the Vortec V-8 5.3L and 5.8L engines (15 mpg avg. city/highway) total highway was about 20mpg.

The New Vortec Engine provides a Longer torque curve for towing and off road applications. One feature I was not sure about is the Auto 4 Wheel drive and 2 high, 4 high and 4 low Push buttons. but after a off road excursion where I needed the momentum of the vehicle moving to get through a sticky situation, the auto 4 kicked in and got me through without a hitch. Another nice feature with Auto 4 on, it reduces the &quot;Pickup truck Tire Spin&quot; on wet pavement. The Z-71 package offers a stiffer suspension and skid Plates for the Engine, transfer case and transmission as well as a large capacity air cleaner and wiring for trailer.

The sound system has some upgrades, front speakers are 6 inch Round woofer with separate dome tweeters in the doors and 4X6 in the rear and CD is standard. The Dash is easy to read, with an added message center LCD display that is bright, includes all engine warning info and such information like &quot;cargo light on&quot;, &quot;Low Fuel&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; system Active. One feature you don't find on trucks is an Air filter for the A/C
This is great for people with allergies.

The ride is quit and is more like driving a car than a truck, The Z-71 has a stiffer suspension so you do get a rougher ride than other models. The Silverado Handles better than the Dodge or Ford on curves and rough terrain. The 4 wheel anti-lock breaks are a little sloppy on loose surfaces, this can give you the feeling like the ABS is not working.

One thing I did not like was the fact that GM does not warranty Paint over 3/36 (Remember the large recall a few years back) this hurt GM, so there not taking any chances. Chevy does offer a rust warranty 7/70. Ford and Dodge both warranty paint to 7/70 ( ford has added outer body rust through to it's warranty),(Remember fords rust Problem in the 70's and 80's).

Overall, I Love My Chevy Silverado &quot;Z-71 off-road&quot; 4-door, It's Performance and handling is much better than I expected from a truck, the body sits on the chassis lower than ford or dodge but the ground clearance is the same. this makes loading and unloading cargo in the bed easier.
