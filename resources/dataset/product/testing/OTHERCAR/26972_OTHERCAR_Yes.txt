            The Galant is a car with its good side and its bad side. First we will start with the bad. A lot of components in this car are made of cheap plastic. In my Galant the gear indicator fell of the gear shifter housing.Metal screws are put into plastic molds, the result the metal split the plastic! This also seemed to a problem with the center console, screws are screwed into a plastic console the result, the console cover is always loose so I have to carry a screw driver in the glove box. Now, its time for the good points. First and foremost the price is excellent, lease or buy this car is a steal! For a so called family sedan the Galants engine has some kick to it, this holds true for the four and six cylinder engines. This car also looks good if you dress it right, some tint, a factory spoiler and even the factory rims make this family sedan into a appealling car to all ages, not just the family man. It is a smooth riding vehicle, accelerates quietly, handles well, and is excellent on fuel consumption.The verdict: buy or lease this vehicle.<br><br>
