            It has a feature on it that allows you to adjust the edging. Normal, soft or hard. Hard makes the pictures come out especially crisp and sharp. Buy more smart media cards because the fine grain eats memory. The pictures that I have printed on an HP Deskjet 832C really do rival the prints that I get back from my photo finisher on my Cannon Elan IIE. And I'm not kidding about this. If price is an issue like it was for me. (I already have a great 35 mm slr camera) I would still say buy the Fuji mx-1200. The pictures rival my 35mm and the ease of use can't be beat. The camera also comes with Adobe Photodeluxe 3.0, In my opinion one of the best image manipulation packages on the market.<br><br>
