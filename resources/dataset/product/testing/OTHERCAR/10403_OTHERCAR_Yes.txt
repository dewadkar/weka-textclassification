            My 1991 Dodge dynasty was the first car I owned that I could say that I really loved.  I named her "Ming". (Ming Dynasty, ha ha..get it?)  My friends would tease me that it looked like a "granny car", but at 20 years old, I was comfortable and very happy.

I did not discover this until later on, when I owned other cars, but the dynasty has a quite a bit of power in it.  I owned it when it was several years old and it still wouldn't take very long to kick in on the highway.  I felt very safe in it and when going out with friends and family, I always offered to drive.

Another bonus that I appreciated later on was the cloth seats.  It may not seem like much, but the velvety softness was welcome in the summer when most other drivers were becoming one with their feiry hot seats.

Although it was several years old, it required very little maintenance.  It never broke down and I never had to replace anything that wasn't a part of regularly scheduled maintenance.  I considered myself lucky.

I expected the car to last many more years but unfortunetally, being rear ended by a big red truck devestated me. My poor Ming was totalled.  I feel confidant that I can say that the dynasty as a car will last a long time.  My mother-in-law still has her 1991 dynasty.

My only major dislike about the dynasty is the tape deck.  Any tape you put in, in any model of stereo will sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks.  Don't believe me?  Go try it out on a friend who owns one.  It's pretty funny.  After you've had the car for a couple of years, the regular radio will sound really slow to you.

My opinion that people who would benefit most from this car are: College students, people who are nervous driving, people who hate hot seats, and people who want a dependable car without too much investment.
