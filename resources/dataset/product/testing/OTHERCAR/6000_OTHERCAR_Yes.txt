                 ...Well, people can argue about the best performing, best value, best room, etc... until they are blue in the face, but the general public will unanimously vote that the Rolls Royce is the Ultimate status symbol.  This e-opinion is based on an 1987 Rolls Royce Silver Spirit.  While some of you may think an 1987 model is ancient, Rolls Royces are known for rather slow changes and keeping with tradition, so most of this things mentioned here will probably apply to even the newest Rolls Royce Silver Seraph.

     So, why would anyone plunk down all that cash for a Rolls Royce?  Some people may argue that it's the epitome of luxury.  After all, the leather in this car is the softest you'll ever feel.  After 13 years and 40K+ miles, it still smells great and hasn't even begun to crack.  Anything that's not covered by leather is covered by the best wood you'll find in a car.  (On a side note, a dealer told me that the wood in each Rolls is marked. That way, if anything happens, they can replace it with the same batch preventing the wood from the dash from clashing with the wood on the doors.)  In any case, this car has everything lined in either leather or wood.  Even the carpets in this car are worth mentioning.  We have 1 inch thick lambswool rugs that are so soft that you'll want to take off your shoes and run your feet through them.  Other amenities include footrests for the rear passengers.  Of course, they get the standard burled walnut tray rests that fold down from the front seats.  An available option is a crystal decanter and 4 crystal shot glasses in a nifty compartment in the trunk.  (I guess that it's okay in this car as it's meant to be driven by a chauffuer.)  Trust me, the interior appointments of this car make those employed by Mercedes and BMW's seem rather cheap.

     So, I started off with the bells and whistles because in this car, they are worth mentioning as they are far superior to anything else on the road.  The layout of this car can best be explained as simple and elegant.  The car has rather simplistic guages that are spread across a massive dashboard.  Of course it comes with heated seats, memory seats, and power everything.  HOwever, Rolls Royce isn't a trendsetter, so don't expect the latest technology that Mercedes and BMW provide.  (Although this might have changed with the new Silver Seraph.)

      The first time you drive this car, you'll notice its weight.  This car is massive and you can feel it.  While the engine is massive, the car is anything but quick.  Additionally, leave yourself extra time to brake because you'll need it.  It's most apparent when you need to brake while going downhill.  It corners as well as you can expect of a car this weight.  Don't expect this car to race through a slalom, but then again, that's not really for what it's built.  Look forward to 8-10 mile to the gallon.  I know that it probably doens't matter, but it's worth noting.  The ride in this car is exquisite.  You can't feel a bump in the road.  It's extremely smooth and you won't even hear the purr of the engine.  You have tons of room to enjoy it as you have more room that you could possibly imagine in this car.

      So, what are the downsides to owning this car?  Well, everything is expensive.  If anything at all breaks down, expect to pay an arm and a leg for a replacement.  For example, one hubcap costs $800.  Additionally, most places won't service these vehicles, so that requires going to the dealer.  If the dealer isn't that close by, this can be inconvenient.  If you experience any minor problems (which I would with a hand-built car), it can be inconvenient.  Also, this car makes people slightly nervous.  You think whether or not you should take it places because you don't want anything happening to it.  (The insurance in this car is remarkably low given that so few are stolen and they don't encourage high-speed driving.)

      Lastly, would I recommend this car to anyone?  Honestly, it depends. Quite frankly, the performance is not as good as a MB S-600 or a BMW 750, and those cars will have the latest technologies (i.e. parktronic), so if that's what you prefer, you might be a bit disappointed.  However, the luxury features in this car make it one of a kind, and if that's what you are looking for, or if you just the ability for people to turn their heads, or is you want to shout out that you are successful, then this is the perfect car for you.  It's the ultimate status symbol, and you'll definitely increase your with this car.<br><br>
