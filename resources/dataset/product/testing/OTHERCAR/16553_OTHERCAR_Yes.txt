            We bought a 1996 Safari new, and it has been a reliable van.  We had to replace the fuel pump at 50,000 miles, it is very hard to change the plugs.  I had to remove the front tires to get to the plugs.  
The doghouse access is inside the van, and is difficult to reach.  The fasteners for the doghouse break easily.
The tires have only lasted around 40,000 miles, and the service engine light comes on and then goes off after a day or so.  The shop says nothing is wrong with the engine.  The maroon color shows every scratch and ding.
To enter the third seat, it is very cramped if you are not a small child, but once in the seat, it is fine.  The third seat is very heavy and difficult to maneuver in and out.
On the positive side, this van is very roomy, it can pull a trailer well, and the interior has done well.  The rear A/C is great.  The dutch doors in the back are great.
Gas mileage does not seem to fluctuate when trailering the camper.  It has good width and the driver's area sits high.  Small leg room for the front passenger.<br><br>
