            Sony gets it right with their Mavica cameras.  The other's should take a lesson.  

Built in flash, automatic focus, hands free timer, light weight, and friendly feel -- these are the characteristics you'll find in the Mavica camera.  Sony's Mavica means you are only minutes from snapping a picture to emailing it to friends and family or posting it on the web.  

Standard pictures are made in jpeg format and stored on a 3 1/2 inch floppy disk that load right into the camera.  This is the biggest selling feature.  

Why bother with those fragile, expensive photo storage cards found on most digital cameras?  You've got to put out big bucks to have enough of those to take a lot of pictures, otherwise you'll have to stop everytime the photo storage card fills up to download your photos from your camera to your computer.  

Not a problem with the Sony Mavica.  Just pop in another inexpensive, readily available 3 1/2 inch standard computer disk and you are good to go.  What's more, there's no need to bother with troublesome downloads to your computer.  Just push the eject button and your photos are already stored in the universally recognized jpeg format for immediate mailing to family or use on your computer.  As a screen saver maybe?  Maybe you'll use it to make a card to send to Grandpa.  No matter, you'll be ready in a flash.  

For comfort and ease of use, the Sony Mavica is the right choice.<br><br>
