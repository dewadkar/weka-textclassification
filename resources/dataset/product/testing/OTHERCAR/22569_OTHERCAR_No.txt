            I owned another Saab before - an 87 900T.  I test drove BMW, and others at the time of purchase, and as the ad says, "People who test drive a Saab,..."  It pretty much stops there.

The car is high performance.  So are the repair bills.  I can't believe some of the crap I was hit with - like replacing exhaust at 51K.  Loose drivers seat requiring replacement with new for $1K at 95K miles?

Come on.  As I have progressed through a long list of repairs I have grown savvy to the fact that many of these repairs are common - and reflect poor engineering.  Is this the fated 1st year of the new model I am experiencing?  If you want the complete list try the NHTSA government website.

The dealerships I have been to leave alot to be desired.  I also owned two Mercedes.  MB knows you when you walk in, take care of you - every customer (not just the ones in the 2 MB family, or the new purchase coming in for oil), know the people at the other dealerships, etc,...  Saab is the reverse.  I feel like I am trying to cut a deal with fast talking car salesmen (can I say that?), who frequently are rude, late, or ignore requested work.  Finally, I started going through the service checklist AFTER service - and found that I started to get things for free after I started to point out that we had a contract, etc,... People were very apologetic.  I have felt like I could hide a camera for 60 minutes from time to time.

Obviously, I am sour on Saabs, as mine have been very expensive to maintain, and required more attention than any plain old car deserves.  After all, I am not a collector, looking for a finicky and well tuned thrill ride.  I am just a working stiff trying to go to work in a nice ride.  My 900SE has been a nice ride, but, it keeps me going to work.

Also, if you are looking: really examine the interior.  I find that if I am gawking around as I drive I must lean far forward to see around.  Peripheral vision is lousy in normal position - but the car is made to be more sporty, and it is.  Mirrors compensate if you are focused on the road ahead.

Also drink holder is awkward, no armrest for driver's right, etc,...
