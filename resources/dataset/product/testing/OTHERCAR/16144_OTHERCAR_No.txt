            My family has recently leased a year 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. What a mistake and a half that was!!! It was a great deal for what we were willing to spend but when we took time to actually look at the fine aspects of the SUV we felt we had gotten short changed. We had first considered another Chevrolet Blazer which we had a chance to own(an excellent car if i may say so myself), an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer, a SR5 Toyota 4Runner, and a Lexus RX300----All for about the price of 28000$
The Jeep had an MSRP of about 27500. (Which i felt is totally ridiculous)We came in with a two door Rav4 with 6 months left on the lease. This is what the deal looked like:
1000$ down
70$ extra a month to burn off the lease for the three year period we are leasing it 
and 310$ a month w/o license,tax,or tag included
This came out to a grand total of 380$ a month plus tax which put us over the 400 mark. The options came with the Jeep were ALL STRICTLY STANDARD, even the vanity mirrors did not come with lights. The CD player is 6cd player by Mopar is excellent excpet the stereo needs to be tuned to a special station to listen to it, not even a sunroof, the locking system would also give off shocks(very painful ones)at random times, this Jeep,,,,A JEEP!!! Did not even come with the trailer hitch!!!!! We had to add these options on for an additional total of 500 dollars. There are a FEW GOOD THINGS about the Jeep though.
The standard V-6 is rev happy, and the thermometer located on the roof comes with all sorts of gadgets to impress your friends, modern age styling, and a nice head turner<br><br>
