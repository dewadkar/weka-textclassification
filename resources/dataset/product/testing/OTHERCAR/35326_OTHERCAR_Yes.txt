            After wanting and looking for the right Tacoma for three years now, I finally bought my beautiful truck on January 6, 2001.

I started my day with the typical boyfriend arguement and decided to go out for a drive in my 1994 Chevy Cavalier convertible.  While cruising around Hollywood and West Hollywood with this annoying noise coming from my engine I figured I'd go check out the Toyota Tacomas they have at the dealership.

After searching the lot I decided to see what kind of deals they had on this beautiful white 2001 extended cab Tacoma.  I sat in this truck and immediately fell in love!  The color was the exact color I wanted. It had lots of options including power windows, locks and mirrors.  It also had a tape and CD player which is great for me, being the typical 80's tape collector I am.  It had extra room in the back which I didn't really want at the beginning but decided it was probably for the best especially if I decide to make any long road trips.  

The interior is quite nice.  The lights on the dashboard are this neon orange when on at nighttime.  The seats are very comfortable and are a gray color.  The truck consists of dual airbags, tilt, power steering-locks-windows-mirrors, cruise control, overdrive, automatic (because in L.A. you need to have an automatic in traffic), digital odometer, storage underneath the backseats, sliding rear window as well as side windows that open in the back, and it is a smooth ride.

So I was pretty confident with this truck and decided to go through all the typical dealership "lets make a deal" stuff! 

My sales man, Will, was a very pleasant person.  He went through all the new books with me and we came to an agreement on monthly payments.  I then spoke with a man by the name of Wayne who bent over backwards for me.  He got the payments around what I wanted, gave me a decent price on my trade in, and we made the deal.  I couldn't believe it!!!  I had been at the dealership for about 3 hours now so I was getting impatient.  I just wanted the truck!  

So I ended up getting my Toyota Tacoma 4X4 extended cab SR5, white, lots of options except a sunroof and bedliner (those will be added on in the near future) for a decent price with no hassles!  

So if you ever plan on getting a Toyota definitely check out this dealership.  It is located on Hollywood Blvd in Hollywood.  Ask for Will or Wayne.  I'm sure they'll make your experience a pleasant one!
