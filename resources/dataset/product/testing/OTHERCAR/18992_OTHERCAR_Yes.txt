            Had the car about 8 weeks now and it definitely turns heads. I bought the silver, and comments abound when getting in and out of the car at shopping malls and gas stations.

One major flaw is in the lane changes, you know shoulder checking...ya can't. The configuration of the low roof-line and high seats make merging and changing to the left lane entirely up to the side view mirror. Luckily enough it works, but....

Looks great especially with the 17" wheels and duel chrome tipped exhausts.

Interior is 95% black except for some chrome accents around the gages, shift knob, and speaker grills. I like the look, and the reddish-orange glow from the dash at night looks very BMW. Headroom is poor with a baseball hat on my head is like 1/2 inch from the roof. Leg room for the front seats is excellent. Back seats, well who cares I don't want no-one back there kicking the seat and dirtying up the nice black floor-mats anyway. By the way opt for the leather seats they are sweet and the smell is like nothing else. Cargo room is fair, I mean how much do you plan to carry anyway, it's not a minivan. The cup holders being in the center console are fine for small coffee cups, but larger drinks like Big Gulps and Super Size Cokes from MD's get in the way and you will find your arm always bumping them when shifting.

Outside is equally as sweet. Fit and finish is excellent and the projector style (not HID) headlights look coooool!! Once again 17" wheels rock. The hood is held up by 2 shocks and not the hurtin style prop rod, as is the same for the hatch. The door handles are the pull toward you and not the pull up style.

Handling and acceleration (keep in mind I purchased the 4 cylinder) are 8/6 that is 8 out 10 for handling, with the 17" Michelin Pilot Sport tires and without the sport tuned suspension this 4 wheel independent car handles very nice, I have yet to take it to it's limits. I keep thinking about when the time comes to replace the Michelin Pilot Sports; not a cheap day at the tire store. Feel around corners is solid and predictable so far, of coarse you can break it loose if you dive into corners to fast, but it's all about finesse. Acceleration is a 6 out of 10, this 4 banger is not gonna be eating much at the lights, but fuel economy was more important to me (average gas price in my area is 80cents/litre) this is not to say it doesn't pull; merging on the freeway and gettin going from a light is not a problem.

I'm still waiting for the after market products to catch up such as cold air intake, performance brake rotors maybe a chip....etc in the meantime this is a nice smooth running car. These aren't Cadillac tires, their 17" hi-performance tire so some freeway noise is cool and expected. Engine noise is fair, lets you know it's actually doing something when you tromp the gas.

I am totally satisfied with my purchase.
