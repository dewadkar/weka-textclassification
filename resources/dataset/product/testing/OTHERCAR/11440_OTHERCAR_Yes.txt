            I remember as a kid in the 70's, it was cool for a while (at least in my neighborhood) to have the newest camera. We all had some of the Kodak 110 cartridge cameras and would snap pictures of just about anything (of course the really cool kids had mom and dad's 35mm). We would have to wait forever for our parents to get the film developed so we could see (and remember!) what we took pictures of.

Not anymore!! Digital cameras have pretty much done away with going to the film developers for us! Though we still have our 35mm (it's only 2 or 3 years old), it has been shelved and forgotten. We finally broke down and caught ourselves up in the digital revolution. 

When looking for a digital camera, we really didn't know a whole lot about what we were after. I have a Sony Mavica FD73 at work that I had brought home a few times, so we had a basic idea about what digital cameras were all about, but pretty much just the basics. I did a little on-line research (reading some of your Epinions to start with), and learned a little more. But, not convinced that it was worth the expense, I held off buying. My wife and I have a dog and two cats that she absolutely loves taking pictures of, so when Christmas finally rolled around, it was time to get serious about a present for her. I finally decided a digital camera would win me big points and started looking again.

After looking at just about every digital camera on the internet and in the stores, I found the Sony Mavica MVC-CD200 - it was love at first sight! I was torn between still and video; both had their pros and cons. Still photo - well, my wife could take photos and send them to her family via email; video - she could capture those special (longer than one second) moments. The CD200 offered both - still images plus MPEG movies. What a deal!

<b>Body</b> The camera itself is somewhat bulkier than most of the "memory stick" cameras, but having used the FD73, I was used to that. It's well built though, it's solid in your hands, nothing rattles or jiggles inside the camera. It's a little heavier than I expected for it's size -about a pound and a half, but I suspect that's because they have managed to cram a mini (3") CD-RW, pop-up flash, computer and accessory ports and a whole lot of features into a (approximately) 6"x3.5"x3.5" body. For all it's weight and slightly bulky size though, it has a sleek profile.

<b>Exterior</b> The outside of the camera at first seems to have too many knobs, buttons, dust covers, and switches to be real. But once we started playing with them, they are really pretty basic, and multi-functional. It has a built in microphone, built in flash, an accessory shoe for another flash, a multi-function mode dial, power switch, buttons that control the flash, features, etc, some accessory ports, and of course, the LCD screen. It's all arranged neatly and functionally.

<b>Battery and Charger</b> The battery is an "InfoLITHIUM" battery that tells the camera approximately how many minutes of charge are left on the battery. It displays the info on the LCD so you always know when you need to recharge or switch to the power adapter. The great thing about this camera is that once the battery is in, it stays in. The charger (which also serves as the power adapter) plugs into the camera body to recharge the battery - no need to take the battery out and set it in a cradle to recharge. You'll only need to take it out if you're taking a lot of pictures and run the battery down and need to switch to a spare. As I said, the charger also serves as the power adapter, so plug it into the camera and an AC outlet and continue taking photos or movies. The charger/power adapter cord is long enough to be able to move around a little if you want to take pictures using it. According to the manual, the battery life is about 75 minutes for picture-taking, and 120 minutes for recording movies. I haven't tried to run the battery out yet, so can't attest to this. 

<b>Internal Features</b> Wow. There are way too many features to write here, so I'll cover mostly the basics. 

The CD200 uses a 3" CD-RW or CD-R disc to record on. Depending on the image size/quality you choose, you can record between 1300 (@ 640x480 standard quality) and 132 (@ 1600x1200 fine quality) still images. Still images can be recorded in TIFF, GIF, or JPEG format. You can also add voice and some special functions such as solarize, black and white, sepia, or negative, which will slightly vary the amount of stills that you can record on a CD.

In continuous record (movie) you can get between 355 minutes (@ 320HQ) and 5400 minutes (@ 160x112). Or, you can get a combination of both still and movie images. Each movie image will be between 15seconds and 4 minutes in length depending on the movie size you choose. The format for movies is either MPEG or clip motion, and of course, there is voice, sepia, black & white, etc.

Some of (but not all) of the features you can use to manipulate your photos are: recording date/time; adjusting exposure; playing back your images - both still and movies - using this feature you can view one, three, or nine photos at once; enlarge the image; slideshow; rotate an image; delete; protect; and select an image to print.

<b>Output</b> Again, there are many of these. The CD200 comes with a 3"CD-RW and a CD-R. It also comes with DirectCD software that allows you to transfer images directly to your computer or your CD-RW through the use of a USB cable. You don't even have to remove the CD from the camera - just hook up the USB cable (which I leave attached to the computer) to the camera, turn the camera on, and the DirectCD software automatically detects the camera and starts the program. This is an awesome and quick way of managing your image files. The only problem I found with DirectCD is that it won't run on a Windows NT machine, and unfortunately, I happen to have NT at work. No problem though, if I use the camera at work, I just bring it home, hook up to the computer and email the pics to myself. Another option is to "finalize" the CD in the camera, pop it out and run it on your CD-RW or CD-ROM.  I have tried it on a couple computers and have found that this runs about 50% of the time on CD-ROM's, and all of the time on CD-RW's. They also include a special tool to connect to your mini-CD to make it "normal" sized, but I haven't had any use for that - my computer runs the mini-CD's fine. Still another option is to hook the camera up to your TV and by using the camera controls, watch your pictures or movies on the "big screen".  

I'm sure that in the two months of owning and using this camera we haven't even come close to using all of the features, accessories and tools provided, but I'm pretty confident that we've used quite a few of them. The price is not cheap - I got ours at around $700, though I have seen them advertised at just over $500 in some places lately. But I consider it an awesome investment; this camera can do so much and the basic functions are so simple to use it is well worth the cost. I really don't see us buying another camera for the next 10 years or so, unless something much, much more advanced comes out.

The MVC-CD200, though it looks complicated, looks can be deceiving. If you're looking for a simple, "no-frills" digital camera, then this one is not for you.  But if you are looking for a camera that you can expand your proficiency and creativity with, you might consider this one. The basic functions are simple enough that a child could use it, but the advanced features will keep an adult well occupied.

The choice of media can't be beat. There are no special connectors, docking bays, memory sticks, or any of that other stuff to mess with. Finalize the CD, pop it out, pop it in your CD-RW and go. Or, if you're lazy like me, just hook it up to the USB and go.  What can be easier?

Overall, though I have limited experience with a lot of digital cameras, I'm confident that I made the right choice - a choice that will last us a long time. And, as a Christmas present to my wife (though we both use it a lot), I scored some major points!!
