            In August, 1997, my husband went to the Subaru dealership to look at the Legacy Station Wagon.  We were looking at a family car, but weren't interested in a mini-van.  We had owned a 1986 Subaru sedan and loved it so we'd though we'd look at what they had.  

What good timing -- Subaru had just come out with the Forester and on sight, my husband loved that car and brought me down to see it.  Lucky for us too, because the Legacy sticker price was a shock.

Not so the Forester, it was in our price range, big enough for tons of kid's &quot;junk,&quot; and with the Subaru reputation we figured we couldn't go wrong.  The only drawback was that it was new and untested.  We took a chance, and just after we bought the Forester, the New York Times came out with a rave review. 

Smooth ride, great handling, good pick-up, reliable in all weather, really good design --after 3+ years I love it as much as the day we got it.  We promised it to our 12-year old son when he goes off to college in 6 years --and we're sure it will be just as good then.<br><br>
