            I actually bought this vehicle on the spur of the moment (from Carpoint.com) and, for the most part, have LOVED it!  You almost get *too* much attention with this car -- hardly a drive goes by without someone commenting on the car (I also have mine in Sunburst Yellow, as shown in the picture).

Surprisingly good gas mileage (about 30 mpg on the highway), great pickup and speed, *wonderful* stereo system, and the convertible top is about as easy and quick as they come.  And, with the top up, you have a decent amount of trunk space.

Only downfalls?  It's a bit uncomfortable for above-average height people when the top is up -- I'm 5'11&quot; and my head touches the ceiling.  And, within the first month, my windshield started cracking from the bottom upward.  I thought this was something specific to my vehicle, but have talked to two other owners who had similar problems (caveat -- I mentioned this to my dealer, and they agreed to replace at no charge).

Would I buy again?  Most certainly ... and I feel the low-40s price tag is certainly within reason for a car of this incredible style and quality.<br><br>
