            I purchased a 2000 EX Kia Sportage 4X4 with 10,000 miles on it from a young couple. I purchased it because my wife liked the body styling. After driving it for 3000 miles I find that there is wind noise, slow acceleration and average gas mileage. What really upsets me is the fact that the front lower fender has a rubbery type paint that started peeling off about the first week in September,2001. I contacted my dealer. He contacted the Kia service rep. I could not get a clear-cut answer as to fixing this problem in the body shop at my local dealer. It is now October 19th and I called Kia, which in turn called the Kia rep. Kia called me back and said the warranty didn't cover this. My advice: never ever will I buy a Kia product again. The warranty means nothing!!!!!!!  I have spent two months just trying to get an answer and when I finally do, they say they can't cover the problem of the thin paint job!  It is my problem apparently. Live and Learn!!!!!! Please heed my advice, stay clear of KIA!!!!!!
