            Our new 2000 SL-2 is the best car we have ever owned.  It is peppy and economical.  The upgraded 125 Hp engine (only $400 extra) really gives it the get-up to go when you need it.  We ordered ours with a full range of options.  The CD player is clear and crisp and the controls are easy to use.  The air conditioner (A must in our area) is powerful and the controls are simple.  The security system is effective and simple.  It's remote handy and practical.  We got the floor and dash mats, the undercoating, and the over coating, as well as the extended warranty.

The design is attractive and practical.  The smooth roll of the dash front is designed to deflect the airbag away from your face.  The car has six cup holders.  The seats are adjustable in many directions and the built -in, adjustable lumbar support is a blessing for me.  The trunk is huge and the back seats fold down independently if you need something bigger (My golf bag is just a tad too tall with the wheels attached).  The valet locks provide extra security for valuables.  The child safety locks are not needed for us, but they are a standard feature

The back seats are a little tough for my stepsons (6'4&quot; 380 and 6'2&quot; 235), they knock knees and hit their heads on the roof as we go over speed bumps, but they do the same thing in my pickup truck.

The car has had a recall item already, the latch on the front center armrest may come loose in a crash and you could get hit with the contents (sounds like the least of your problems to me).  Other than that, the car has needed no unscheduled service.
