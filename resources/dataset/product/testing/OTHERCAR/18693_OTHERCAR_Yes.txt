            For Christmas, in 1994, a friend of mine was given a digital camera.  I remember thinking &quot;boy this is pretty cool!&quot;... until I saw the resulting images.  They were indistinct, blurry and the color didn't come close to what I had seen when I took the pictures.  He was happy though; it gave him more fodder for his growing photoshop obsession.

I didn't even think about digital cameras again until I went on a routine trip to fetch some coffee about three months back and, on a whim, stepped into a camera store next door to the coffee shop.  I asked the clerk what the latest in digital photography had to offer and without hesitation, he pulled the Olympus C-2000Z off the shelf and started showing me all it could do.  Not only was it packed with features, but had a very classy, old-style SLR look about it.  I walked out of there with camera in hand, one-thousand dollars poorer and braced for a month of top-ramen entrees.

I bought two 32 meg SmartMedia cards and two sets of rechargeable batteries (it takes 4 AAs) and a FlashPath floppy adapter (highly recommended!) within the first week.  My friends started to worry when all of my time was spent either walking around taking pictures, or copying them to my computer's harddrive.  

I'm certainly not a professional photographer, but I was lucky enough to have learned the basics of 35mm photography in my Graphic Design class, high-school, senior year.  I enjoyed taking pictures and seeing what came out, but couldn't bear the hassle of developing them.  Not to mention the frustration which I felt when the bulk of the roll was wasted on overexposed or blurry shots.  Paying good money for the same results was out of the question.  I stopped taking pictures at the end of the semester.

Since I bought the C-2000Z three months ago, I've taken over 6,000 pictures which fill 5 CDs.  I've had the freedom to experiment with different shutter speeds and aperture settings without fear of wasting precious film.  I've taken pictures of everything imaginable (a very small sampling available at http://www.nitropoweredfunnycar.com), and my camera has taken me to places in my hometown of Seattle which I never would have thought to go before.

My only complaints with this camera are: 1) there isn't an easy way to clean the SmartMedia contacts and 2) after leaving the camera on for some fairly long period of time, you actually have to remove the batteries and put them back in to &quot;reset&quot; it.  The latter is not mentioned anywhere in the manual, and it may just be a glitch peculiar to my camera, but efforts to determine if this is expected behavior have been fruitless at best; Olympus hasn't responded to either of two emails I sent to their customer service department.... and this has probably been the hardest part for me to swallow.

I heartily recommend this camera for professional &quot;wannabes&quot; or for amateurs who are only amateurs because they hate wasting film!<br><br>
