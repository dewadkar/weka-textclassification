            This camera was given to my husband and myself as a Christmas gift from my parents last year.  The Photo Max PDC 640 came in a Digital Creative Camera Kit.  

As digital cameras go, this one is appealing because of it's price range. It does have a reasonable price.  I would say that it is in the medium price range as there are many that are less expensive and certainly many that are more expensive.

The second most appealing thing is appealing about any digital camera.  It doesn't use film!  It makes sending pictures via e-mail and the web easy because you no longer have to bother with scanning pictures.  The thought of taking endless pictures without having to purchases film would be appealing to anyone.

The images taken with this camera are of good quality.  Taking pictures with this camera can be summed up in three easy steps.  First you just aim and shoot.  It's that easy.  You can either look through the regular viewfinder or the 1.8 inch LCD viewfinder when you take your shot.  Secondly, you can preview your picture.  You can then easily decide to keep it or delete it.  There is no more worrying if the shot was good enough or if a person's eyes were closed or not.  You can instantly see.  Then the third step would be to download your images to the computer and manipulate them.

Here are some specifics on the optics:
* Optical and LCD viewfinder: 1.8 inch LCD Monitor
* Lens aperture: F 4.0/1
* Lens focal range: 46 mm equivalent 35 mm camera
* Electronic shutter: 130 sec to 1/10,000 sec
* 640 X 480 CCD image sensor
* Speed: ISO 100 equivalent
* Flash: range is 3 - 10 ft (normal)

Here are some specifics on the images:
* Compression: JPEG
* Color : 24 bit (millions of colors) --- The images on this camera do not look &quot;washed out.&quot;  The color is highly satisfactory.
* There are four resolution modes, each with a specific number of images.
  SUPER HIGH RESOLUTION: 640 X 480 = 12 images / 2 MB memory card
  HIGH RESOLUTION: 640 X 480 = 24 images / 2 MB memory card
  MEDIUM RESOLUTION: 640 X 480 = 36 images / 2 MB memory card
  LOW RESOLUTION: 320 X 240 = 96 images / 2 MB memory card

I have tried each of these resolutions and have happy with the results of all of them.  I expected the pictures to have a very low quality when I used low resolution but found they did not.  I normally prefer to use high resolution if I'm just using the camera around the house because it's no problem for me to download them and start over.  However, on a trip where I would need more pictures, I would use either medium or low resolution.

This camera can be used with 4 AA alkaline, Nicad or NiMH batteries.  The life of batteries in this camera is not long.  Your battery indicator will begin to show low batteries after taking one full set of pictures.  The life of the batteries generally is for less than 100 pictures I have found.

The camera also came with an AC adapter which I use whenever possible to save the life of the batteries.  I always use this while I'm downloading pictures to the computer.

Some other features of the camera include recording the date and time, tripod mountable, auto flash, fill-in flash, flash-off, red-eye reduction, self timer (10 seconds), and a three mode focus range (macro, close-up, and normal).

It came with a limited one year warranty and help from an 800 number that's open 7 days a week 8 AM to 8 PM (EST). 

Installing the software that came with the computer was easy.  Once I plugged the cord into my computer, I just left it there and then plug it into the camera whenever I'm going to download.  Downloading a full set of pictures can be done in only a few minutes.  The software gets the job done but is very easy to use.  With the Polaroid Photo Max Image Maker Software that came with it you can edit your pictures in a variety of ways, publish, print, and produce them as well as manipulate them.  While editing you can crop, clone, paint, rotate, add text, cut/paste, or resize.  When you have the image like you want it, you can e-mail it via an electronic postcard, create a greeting card, sticker, or t-shirt with it or use it as your background or screensaver.  Manipulations allow the user to lighter, darken, or sharpen the image, airbrush, add colors, change backgrounds and produce special effects.

One important factor that makes this camera different from some that many people own is that it does not have the removable floppy disk.  It is very important to know that you must actually connect this camera to your computer by using the cable that comes with the camera to download images. This may not be convenient for everyone.  Many people prefer the ease of being able to simply remove a floppy disk, place it in their computer and look at the pictures.  I am satisfied with downloading pictures without the floppy disk as that feature is much more expensive. However, this could be an issue for some people.  Adapters are available as an option that would allow the use to use a floppy disk, however, I have not seen a price posted on these.  

Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera.  The pictures are of good quality and both the camera and software are easy to use.  I would recommend this camera to anyone thinking about purchasing a digital camera.
