            I now own my 3rd Jeep product and figured it was time to let the interested public know what I've known for the past 12 years.  Jeeps are truly everything they're meant to be.

My first Jeep was an 87 Commanche sport truck.  A perfect starter vehicle for a high schooler.  Not too much power and good gas mileage.  After that I moved on to my first real Jeep, a 1989 Wrangler Sahara.  I kept that Jeep for 9 years, and ended up with 6&quot; of suspension lift, 33&quot; swampers, lockers F&amp;R, etc.  I truly loved that Jeep.  I never had any problems I couldn't fix myself.  I rolled it into a swamp one day and after getting it wheels down, started it up in almost 4 feet of water until I killed the engine, and then drove it out on the starter.  After pulling the plugs and cranking it to force the water out of the engine, I drove it home.  65,000 miles later (145,000 total), I traded it in on a new 98 Wrangler Sahara (fully loaded).  

To anyone interested in buying a new or used Jeep, go with the 6 cylinder engine and a hard top.  A/C is really appreciated.  If you have a short significant other, get the auto tranny because the pedals might be hard to reach.  There are a ton of mail order companies that cater to Jeeps, use them, YOU WILL SAVE $$$$.  Avoid body lifts, they can be dangerous.  And remember the snowball effect of Jeep modifications,  anything you modify will require you to modify something down the line.

If you want a fun to drive vehicle that is extremely capable off road, and you don't mind having the wind in your hair and a turning radius that can't be matched, a Jeep might be what you're looking for.  If not, go buy a Ford or something!<br><br>
