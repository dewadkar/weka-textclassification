            The Lexus LS400 is in a class of its own. That is why it is Lexus's Flagship car. Lexus is renowned for making the finest cars in the world and the LS is a major reason why. When you step into the car, the first thing you will notice is the comfort of the seats. They are soft, flexible, and covered in high-quality leather. The second thing that stands out in the LS is the array of controls designed to comfort the passengers. Features like dual side air conditioning and lumbar make the ride a pleasure.

Although the Lexus is built for luxury, it also packs a large punch of speed. The two hundred ninety horsepower under the hood make the LS feel like itï¿½s taking off. Shock absorption is also a high point. Riding in the car feels like gliding on air and cannot be replicated in any other car. No BMW, Mercedes, or Audi is in the same class.

I would recommend this car to anyone looking into a luxury car. There is no other experience like it.
