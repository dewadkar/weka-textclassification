                  I recently got my farmers license and I needed a pickup truck to go along with it.  However, I didn't want an old beat up Chevy Silverado or Jeep Commanche, I wanted something that would be both styling and would meet the requirements of my farmers license.  After some extensive test driving of some s-10's and Rangers, I felt that they had enough power to meet my needs. 

 
      However, I wanted a pickup truck that would be styling as well and could get me a lot of ladies.  The styling of the regular S-10's and Ranger's were nothing to brag about and I didn't want to put an extra 2,000-3,000 dollars in detailing.  It was a few days later when the Chevy S-10 Xtreme caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was a performance truck that someone supped up and was putting on the lot to sell, however, when I saw several others that looked just like it, I knew it was all stock.  


      The Xtreme is the best looking stock pickup truck I have ever seen.  It's unique 16" aluminum wheels and it's low-riding stature make it look like it's been supped up.  It sits at about 4 to 6 inches off the ground making it look like a NASCAR truck.  The exterior looks may be dazzling, but you won't be disapointed on the inside.  In the LS model, the Xtreme is as comfortable as any passenger car.  It comes in bench or bucket seating and a CD player is almost standard on every model.  It comes with a 4.3 V6 putting out 190 horsepower which is more than enough to get this truck moving from 0 to 60 in about 6 seconds.  It also comes with a 2.2 4 cylinder engine that gives only 120 horsepower.  If these figures are not enough, it is rumored that Chevy is comming out with a 4.8 straight 6 giving 250 horsepower.  


      Once behind the wheel, the truck looks and feels like a regular car.  It's ZQ8 suspension lowers the entire car about 3 inches but also gives a stiffer ride which is one of the only downfalls to the Xtreme.  Otherwise, it takes corners real well and accelerates like my Dads Firebird.  The top speed of the vehicle is obviously limited but I'm guessing it's up in the 120's with the 4.3 V6 (ungoverned).  I'm not quite sure about the 2.2 because I've never driven one.  The truck comes standard with air conditioning and heating and all LS models have power windows, locks, and brakes.  There are disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the back but they are adequete for stopping this little truck.


      All in all, this is one of the best looking trucks I have ever seen.  Besides it looking so good, it also handles well and feels like a car.  And trust me on this one, it gets a lot of people to turn their heads and stare at your car getting them thinking, "what the hell kinda car is that?"  or "that kid musta put a lot of money detailing that car."  But the truth of the matter is, no money goes into detailing it, unless you want to.  The price of the Xtreme is rather low.  You can get a LS regular cab with almost everything in it for around $15,000 to $16,000.  The extended cab models that are fully loaded can get pretty pricy.  They start around $18,000 to $25,000.  If you buy an Xtreme or any other S-10 for that matter, and keep it in tip-top condition, the price does not depreciate that much at all.   You can sell your truck after 3 years and get almost what you paid for it (that is, if you don't wreck it).  So, if you're looking for a moderately inexpensive truck that gives both performance and looks, get the Chevy S-10 Xtreme.  As of now, I can't think of any other trucks made by Ford, GMC, or Toyota that can even compare.  So, if you need a truck to pick up the ladies, go with the S-10 Xtreme.
