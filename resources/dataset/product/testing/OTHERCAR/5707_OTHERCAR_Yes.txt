            I bought my '93 integra sedan as my first car in August 2000.  It instantly caught my eye, after I had looked at many cars on about 8-10 other lots.  After some bargaining, we reduced the purchase price to $9,200.  The car is in excellent condition and had only 40,300mi at the time, despite being 7 years old.  It also came with a 3-month warranty, as we bought at an Acura dealer.

The Integra is the entry-level model for the Acura lineup.  Acura came to the US in 1986 and this was when they introduced the first Integra.  The 1993 is a second-generation Integra.  The third-generation was released as 1994 model, with significant stylistic changes, but the same 1.8L 4-Cylinder in the RS/LS versions.  Acura released the 4th-generation of this line in the summer of 2001 as the 2002 Acura RSX.  The car was changed significantly for this redesign, but maintains a similiar spirit and caters to the same crowd as the Integra has since it was introduced, though you'll find more power, a sportier image, and greater comfort features.  Current RSXs sell for around $20,500 - $24,500.

<b>Pros</b>
<i>This car has many pros in my opinion, even after closely scrutinizing it.</i>  
1. Fun Factor - First and foremost is the fun factor.  Superb handling and very tight cornering allow the driver to always feel like he/she is in full control and make going around corners a fun experience.  Acceleration in non-GS models is generally slightly better than average, but very spirited and the high-revs of the engine make it quite fun.  It can go up to 140mph and the car looks sporty as well.
2. Reliability - is top-notch.  It is easy to overlook this fact when shopping and become overly carried away with looks and prices, but it is one of the most important characteristics of a car.  No one wants to drive a car that is prone to stall at any time, or requires that the owner constantly dole out monthly payments to fix one problem after another.  Acura has a superb reputation for reliability and this carries into all integra models.  My car has had only 1 minor problem from a leaky hose that was fixed under dealer warranty.  Their exceptional reliability lets their owners drive them for longer and at less expense, which means that you really get more worth out of the car.  
3. Value - The long term value in integras is great because they last for many miles and have few mechanical problems.  New models are not all that pricey ($22,000-24,000), and come with nice comfort features for this price range.  My '93 has an excellent Dolby Surround Stereo, Cruise control, and tilt/steering for starters.  Furthermore, when the time comes to resell it, you will often be able to get a good amount of money.  This is because the car is popular and in very high demand. And also because of its great reliability, which means that buyers know that it can go much longer than other cars.(often 200,000mi, sometimes 250,000mi!)
4. Fuel Efficiency - The integra is a smaller car with a 4 cylinder and is thus pretty fuel efficient.  You can expect about 26mi/gal in cities and 32-34mi/gal on the highway.  This is another long-term cost saving feature.
5. Versatility - For a smaller/sporty sedan the integra is actually quite versatile.  I have driven in ice and snow, and its solid handling certainly helps here.  But in terms of storage space, one can easily flip down the rear seat to have large cargo space.  The trunk itself is also not a bad size.     

<b>Cons</b>
<i>The few foibles that I found with the integra are for the most part not detrimental to the vehicle.</i>
1. Small Fuel Tank - The tank is about 13gal total. This is an anoying feature to me, but not too horrible, since you do not end up paying anymore.  It just means that despite great fuel efficiency, you end up having to still go to the gas station a normal amount.  
2. Wind Noise - Wind noise is definetely noticeable, especially at speeds of 60mph and up.  The engine is quite noisy as well, but I thoroughly enjoy this spirit at high speeds, and do not wish that Acura had toned it down. The noise doesn't include squeaks and rattles at all.
3. Cramped Rear Seat - The rear seat is adequate.  However, it is not of a generous size, and may be a difficult fit for large people.  This is not a problem for the front seats, and the seats are quite comfortable and supportive.
