            Bought the truck because it looks great and is more comfy than our old truck (1994 Mazda pickup).  First of all, got screwed on the interest rate and somehow managed to pay $460 per month for 6 years!  (Our own stupidity for not noticing it before signing papers.)  

The paint began chipping less than two months after purchase and out local Chevy dealer claims we just don't know how to take care of a vehicle.  This truck was 'babied' including frequent waxing, washing with the baby's cloth burp rags, etc.  

Now, just 6 months after purchase, the computer has gone out twice.  In fact, it's in the shop right now.  When it goes out, the ABS light comes on, the power brakes go out, and it gets between 6 and 8 miles to the gallon!  The light goes off and the braking capability returns when the engine cools down.  The dealership tried to tell us that the diagnostic computer says the light came on when it was going 106 miles per hour, but the truck shuts off at 92.  They called back to tell us that, when the computer says that, the computer isn't working.  

Also, the doors whistle, especially on the passenger-side.  We think the frame may be bent, but Chevy claims they can't hear it.  

If the computer goes out again, we'll be eligible for the lemon law here so we're just sitting and waiting.
