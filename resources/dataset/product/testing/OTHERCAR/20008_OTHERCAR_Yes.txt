            These is nothing to dislike about this car.  Very reliable - have had no issues with maintenance or otherwise.  Leased car for 3 years.  Cost was  $400 with $1000 down - which seemed to be an excellent deal.  Car performs very well on long distance trips.  Always enough power with V6 engine.  Very smooth.  Always draws positive comments from other riders.
Make sure you get Nakamichi stereo, it is one of the best in the industry.  One issue is that the front license plate does not come mounted which is required in CA.
