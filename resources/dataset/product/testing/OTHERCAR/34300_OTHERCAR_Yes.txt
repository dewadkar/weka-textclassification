            After owning sports cars for many years, the change to a pickup was a difficult decision. The sharp cornering and smooth handling of a Z-28 was going to be hard to replace, but this Dodge Ram Club Cab, with all the extras in their SLT package made it an easy sell. The powerful 5.9 litre V-8 Magnum delivers with smooth, quiet power when I need it and a ride like any full size car. It's luxurious interior and huge back seat, although not as convenient as the Quad Cab, provides ample room for 6 in the cab. It shifts smoothly, has little maintenance and the beautifully swept front and sides are easy on the eyes. This truck shouts &quot;POWER&quot; all over. This truck is for first time truck buyers who will never go back after driving a Dodge Truck! It isn't for the teenagers first car though, as a police officer, I'd recommend a smaller Dakota as a first time truck.I'll never own any other truck than a Dodge after this experience!<br><br>
