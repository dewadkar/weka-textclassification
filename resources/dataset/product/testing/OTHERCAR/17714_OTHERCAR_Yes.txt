            I began with a '98 SL1 and was absolutely delighted.  Some of the standard features were options on other cars:  trunk light; delayed interior light; keyless remote door and trunk entry.  At first I thought they were trying to be cheap by using plastic on the doors.  Now I see they're right to do so.

I lost the first one when my wife was in two accidents on two successive weekends.  Neither accident was her fault.  The first one, a rear-ender, almost collapsed the trunk deck but it was repairable.  The second totalled the car but we were still able to drive it until it was replaced.

We now have a '99 and love it just as much.  More because we prefer this deep red color to the silver plum we had.  A minor detail.  We've taken both cars on long trips and were amazed at the gas mileage: 35mpg+.  

We appreciated the one price policy used by all dealers.  I've bargained for cars before and no matter how much or how little I spent, I always felt I was getting screwed.  Not here.  In fact, the girl who sold us our car has become almost a member of the family.  She's getting married in May and we're invited.

I call for regular maintenance and they know my voice.  They know what kind of schedule I'm on and they accommodate themselves to me.  Service is fast, reliable and inexpensive.  One very nice touch:  the wash the car each time they service it.

Visibility in the car is excellent.  I know where my fenders are without having to guess.  It handles so very well in both heavy traffic and on the open road.  It's a light car and easy to handle.  I recently had a Dodge Stratus as a rental car after this one got hit in a parking lot.  The Dodge was a terrible experience.  It sucked up gas like a dry sponge in the desert.  When I finally got "my baby" back, I was ecstatic.

I drove a cab for over 16 years and I know how a car should behave.  Within 20 minutes of driving a car, I know what it will and won't do.  Same thing for this one.  It's got a four-cylinder engine, so I don't expect jackrabbit getaways from traffic lights.  Then again, those kinds of starts are terrible on gas mileage, tires and transmissions.

The instrument panel is very conveniently located and laid out so that I can reach everything without taking my eyes off the road.  Dials and gauges are very easily read and there are gauges on the dashboard, not "idiot lights" so you can see what's going on.

The sound system is much better than one would expect in a car this size and price--outstanding system.  Interior is thoughtfully laid out with the rear seat folding down in a 75%-25% split, making it easy to carry long things in a surprisingly spacious trunk.

The body is solidly built and the doors close with a very reassuring "chunk", signifying a well-built car.  There's just a tad less than the ideal amount of room in the front since the front seat doesn't go back very far and the steering wheel is a tilt wheel (standard) but locks in place once you've chosen your position.  This small room results in my rubbing my right thigh on the bottom of the wheel when I get into the car--a very minor inconvenience when you consider the rest of the car.

My wife is a late blooming driver, not getting her license until she was in her 40s.  She's not the most confident driver in the world but she feels very safe and comfortable in this car.  

The styling is very distinctive with the "raised rear end" appearance which is esthetically pleasing to me.  I've also been noticing more and more Saturns on the road since I got mine.  One becomes sensitized to seeing other cars like one's own--must be the need for reinforcement of one's opinion--but at first I didn't see that many.  Now I see so many of them that it reaffirms my own wise decision to get one.

The next one I get will be the L-Series--the next one up in style, comfort and price.  Although I love what I have, I've driven the L-Series and it's even better than mine.

Not only would I recommend this car to a friend, I did so, he bought one and is delighted.  My son and daughter-in-law are also looking at one.  I loved my two Toyotas but this is even better.  I'm sold on Saturn.
