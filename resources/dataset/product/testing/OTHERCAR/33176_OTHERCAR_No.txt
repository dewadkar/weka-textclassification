            My husband bought me a new car recently. I had never seen or heard of the car he purchased and due to an unfortunate death of my hard drive, we had no access to <b>Epinions</b>. Hopefully, if you are considering purchasing a <b>2001 Suzuki Esteem</b>, I can help you make a more informed decision than the one my husband made.

I suppose you might be thinking that I hate this car. I don�t. It beats walking I suppose. Would <b>I</b> have chosen this car myself? Probably not. Unfortunately, time and money were key issues and we needed an inexpensive vehicle fast. Had our computer not been down, I�d likely have consulted Epinions and even comparison shopped online. 

Having less than stellar credit, we found the local Suzuki dealer more willing to work with us than the local Chevrolet dealer. We had also visited a Hyundai dealer, the salesman there actually suggested the Suzuki dealer after discussing our needs with him. The Hyundai salesman also was great with our kids who certainly didn�t enjoy car shopping. Apparently, the owner of the Hyundai dealer also owned the Suzuki dealership.

Since the kids had their fill of car dealerships, I sent my husband to look at the Suzuki dealer. A few hours later he came home and told me he had purchased a brand new <b>Suzuki Esteem</b>.

<I>***Note to self: Never send husband car shopping alone and NEVER shop without researching online***</I>

I had been driving a 1996 <b>Saturn SL2</b> for the past 5 years and had grown used to the small sedan. Since my driving record is spotless and because I usually have the children with me, my husband suggested that he take the Saturn and that I would drive the new car. I reluctantly agreed, but here I am a few weeks later driving a shiny new <b>Suzuki Esteem GL</b> in <b>black pearl</b>.

<b><I>The boring yet important features portion of my review�</b></I>

I�m not a car expert; I am merely a mother looking for a comfy, dependable car to drive with my two children. If you are looking to spend $12,000 or so, you�ll need to know more than that the car seats five and accommodates carseats well.

That being said, here are some of the features of the <b>2001 Suzuki Esteem</b>

- 1.8-liter, 16-valve engine, DOHC engine with multi-point electronic fuel injection
- Ventilated front power disc brakes
- AM/FM stereo with in-dash CD player
- Dual retractable cup holders
- Daytime running lights
- A/C
- Second-generation dual airbags 
- Rear door child safety locks 
- Child seat tether anchors 
- Integrated front and rear crumple zones 
- Energy-absorbing steering column 
- Side-impact door beams
- Fuel efficient- estimated fuel economy (Automatic GL): 
Highway mpg 33
   City mpg 26 

<b><I>What isn�t included�</I></b>

We went with the bare minimum, only standard features for us. I am getting used to life without keyless entry and power locks, but am less than thrilled with the lack of a light in the trunk. Floor mats are not included either and the car was delivered with barely enough gas to get home.

I was also unimpressed with the salesman at the time of delivery. The car was delivered later than promised and he did not explain any of the features of the car. The car was somewhat clean, though we had to wait an additional half-hour for them to get it ready.

I have owned several different cars over the years and all of them featured rear defrosters that automatically shut off after a while. In this vehicle, if you forget to turn the defroster off it will remain on indefinitely. Even if you turn the car off, when you start it up again, the defroster will still be on. With a very small red dot to indicate the defroster is on, it is easy to have it on unintentionally.

<b><I>Warranty</b></I>

- All components of the vehicle as supplied by Suzuki for 36 months or 36,000 miles
- Battery is covered for 24 months or 24,000 miles.
- Repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship will be made with no charge for parts or labor. 
- No deductible.
- If original body sheet metal panels develop perforation due to corrosion, they're covered for 36 months, with no limit on mileage. 
- The tires are covered by a separate warranty from the tire manufacturer.

We purchased an extended warranty to increase coverage to 5 years/60,000 miles. In addition, a complementary <b>Roadside America Motor Club</b> membership is included. The membership provides 5 years of roadside assistance and other benefits. Considering I don�t know how to change a tire, I appreciate this.

<b><I>What this Mom thinks of the car�</b></I>

Since I only have two children and only one is still in a car seat, I am satisfied with the size of the car. The <b>Century SmartMove</b> car seat that we use fit securely in the rear middle seat. There are three attached tether anchors as well as child safety locks.

The car looks fairly sporty for a kid-friendly sedan. The trunk doesn�t look like much from the outside, but it is surprisingly roomy. I have actually fit TWO strollers and a week�s groceries in the trunk with room to spare. I couldn�t do that in my Saturn. I do wish the trunk had a light, but my husband said he would get some kind of light in there soon.

I wish we�d have sprung for power locks and keyless entry, it was a nice feature on my Saturn and made life easier. With a toddler in one arm and shopping bags in the other, fumbling for my keys is no fun.

The drink holders are not the greatest; a flimsy holder slides out and really doesn�t accommodate larger drinks. Don�t supersize your Coke and forget about getting a Big Gulp. The holder in the center armrest/console is a bit awkward to use. There are no front speakers for the stereo.

The car runs fairly smoothly when I�m not going over 50 MPH but I find the ride a bit shaky at higher speeds. I noticed that the steering wheel seems to vibrate when I am fully braking. At red lights the mirrors seem to vibrate as does the steering wheel. When using the expressway, the car seemed louder than other cars I�ve driven. This includes a few really old used cars like a 1985 Delta 88 I used to drive.

The <b>Bridgestone Potenza RE92</b> tires the car came equipped with leave something to be desired. One tire developed a slow leak which, when I took it to a tire shop, couldn't be patched. The warranty doesn't cover punctures (though I suspect the puncture occurred when the car was driven from one dealership to another) and the tire is next to impossible to find locally. I know, I tried. For hours.

I even called the dealership for advice on finding the tires and they were clueless. They didn't even know what tires I needed much less where the heck to find them.

Perhaps my least favorite aspect of owning a Suzuki is the insurance rate. When I removed my husband�s old Ford Aerostar from my policy and added the new car, my premium went up nearly 600.00 per year. My agent told me <b>Suzuki vehicles in general are expensive to insure</b>. No kidding. 

The car looks much more appealing on paper than it does behind the wheel. When my husband showed me all the information, brochures and such, I had high hopes. After several weeks, I'm very glad we purchased an extended warranty. I doubt this car would make it 5 years without many problems.

<b><I>What the kids think�</b></I>

My kids absolutely love the CD player, which is standard in this car. We only had a cassette player in the Saturn. The AM/FM stereo and CD player are easy to use. Unfortunately, my kids still argue over <I>which</I> CD to listen to.

The backseat allows adequate legroom for my six-year-old while the Saturn was a bit cramped. My daughter has also commented on the �soft seats.� The kids were hoping for a red car, I wanted green. We ended up with black. 

With the hot and humid summers ahead, the strong A/C is a bonus too. My kids can actually feel the cold air in the back seat, in the Saturn they couldn�t feel it well.

A comfortable, shiny car with a CD player is enough to please my little ones.

<I>�Too bad it isn�t red though�� ~Amanda (6)</i>


<b><I>Overall</b></I>

While the 2001 <b>Suzuki Esteem</b> is not my dream car, it meets my bare minimum needs. Had I had the time to really shop around and better credit, I highly doubt I�d have chosen this car.

I appreciate the ease of car seat installation and the tether anchors as well as the roomy trunk. So far, the car has performed fairly well around town but not so well on the highway. That is, of course, when all of the tires remain inflated.

Thankfully, I don�t know how the car holds up in a collision, I haven�t had to test the airbags or the side impact door beams. I hope I won�t be editing this review with that information either.

For the price, the <b>Suzuki Esteem</b> is a mediocre car, but not really the best value. Given the circumstances, we needed easy financing and an inexpensive family car, my husband made an impulse buy.

At first, the car seemed like a good buy with easy payments but the dealership has "forgotten" the payoff required on our trade-in. Apparently the easy financing has an additional price to pay.

If you frequent highways or regularly drive over 50 mph, you may want to choose another car. Other sedans will most  likely be less expensive to insure and other dealers offer more choices in my experience. I�ve driven Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles, Fords and my Saturn and found almost all to have smoother rides.

I would have to say I would only recommend the <b>Esteem</b> if your circumstances are like ours. If you have time to shop around though, you can probably find a similar car with more features at a comparable price. 

We didn�t get the courtesy or the quality we got at Saturn. We added no fancy features and received mediocre customer service, but my family and I do have a comfortable little car. 

If you need a fairly inexpensive sedan, don�t drive excessively, aren't very choosy about extras and don�t have perfect credit, a <b>Suzuki Esteem</b> may be what you�re looking for.

On the other hand, since you are obviously comparison shopping here at <b>Epinions</b>, do yourself a favor and consider other cars in this price range. Trust me. 

I have learned that I will never shop without
<b>Epinions</b> and that my husband won't be allowed to shop without <b>ME</b>. Unless of course he's buying me a present. So long as the present isn't a car. Or at least not a <b>Suzuki</b>.
