            I have been driving Maxima's since 1990, I gave the 90-SE to my daughter it now has 150,000 miles on it and still run's as good as it did the day I bought it. I also owned a 96 and a 98 Maxima SE.  I loved the 1990 but was not as happy with the 96 and 98 models.  I am very happy with the 2001 SE-AE, it handles, rides and looks so much better than the last two I owned.  This car is a awesume performer and very quite even at 80 miles per hour.  The looks and handling ability of the SE-AE make it well worth the higher price tag over the standard SE to me.  The only thing I am still adjusting to on this car is the Leather Seat's, I have never had a car with Leather before and find the seat back much firmer than the cloth.  This is a little personal feeling on my part and I am sure I will adjust as time goes on, as my wife loves the Leather and think's the seat's are by far more comfortable than cloth. Also I might add the Leather is much nicer looking.  If you are looking for a very nice looking fun to drive car with sport car handling and family sedan room you can't go wrong with this car.
