            It is not really my style.  I like a luxury sports car.  But this crazy car just won't go away.  I have 4 more payment on it and I have never had a major problem with it at all.  Mine has a double overhead CAM.  I accelerate fast all the time.  I do not baby this car in any way shape or form.  It has 108,000 miles.  At 100,000 miles, it started using about 1 qt of oil every 4,000 miles.  I change the oil around 5,000 miles (that is what Saturn recommends).  If you like the style of this car, you will fall in love with the way it handle and last and last and last.  Great gas mileage too.<br><br>
