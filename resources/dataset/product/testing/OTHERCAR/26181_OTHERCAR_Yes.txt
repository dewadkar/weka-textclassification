            It's time for an update on the reliable early 90's 4Runner.

I bought my 4-cylinder 4Runner in March 1990 and it's still running strong. Sure, it's a little loose in the engine but, after 212,000 miles, that's not unexpected. I suspect that my old, reliable workmate will still be with me as we pass through a quarter-million miles in a couple of years.

In my 12-1/2 years of ownership, I've had to replace the waterpump (about 7 years ago) and the radiator (last year). The only major repair I endured was replacing a gear in the manual transmission (about 6 years ago) which was ruined when the top to a plate covering the shifter entry came loose and dumped transmission fluid. This, it seems, was a fluke in the world of 4Runners. 

The finish on this car is amazing. After 12 years, it's still holding up well. No rust problems.

The 4WD has never given me problems.

The drop-down tailgate is nice. I prefer it to the hatch style because it's more useful for hauling big stuff.

I get about 19 miles to the gallon through mixed miles (highway   city); not that much off of what I got when it was new.

Good car....
