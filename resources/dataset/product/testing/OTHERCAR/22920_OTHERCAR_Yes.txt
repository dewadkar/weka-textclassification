            Living in Ohio I frequently find myself up to my tush in snow. I like to tell myself that's why I bought a Wrangler, but who am I kidding. I'm still a kid at heart and I love my Wrangler.

My Wrangler, a black '95, is your most basic transportation: 5 speed, 4x4, rag top with the half doors. It leaks air, is noisy, but, man is it fun. It's a Jeep, what did you expect. It's got a CD player that I couldn't hear without the sound bar. There's no AC, unless you consider the 4/80 AC that comes standard with the top down. But, who needs it. If you're looking for amenities, get a Grand Cherokee. If you want something you can hose down if it gets dirty, get the Wrangler. And, if you want something that's just plain fun to drive, the Wrangler's for you.

The Wrangler sits high - short people need a step or a hand to get in. At 6'2&quot; it's just my size. From where you sit, you can see everything: good visibility all around. If you don't like the wind blowing your new hairdo around, you're in the wrong car. If you love the sun in your face and the open feeling running around &quot;topless&quot; gives you, you can't beat the Wrangler.

The Wrangler has a short wheel base and &quot;stiff&quot; seats, but rides surprisingly good on long trips. It could be a little more stingy on gas, but it's still a whole lot better than some of your &quot;big&quot; SUV's or land yachts. The top's a little awkward, but this isn't a convertible. I put the top down and it stays there till November. The Wrangler's got a heater that puts out, even on the coldest days. Even the back seat passengers are comfortable. And, you don't have to drive for miles before you feel the heat. In my case, warm air's there inside of 2 blocks. The back seat is a little cumbersome to get into, but it's not like you're having a Chinese Fire Drill at every intersection. The Wrangler is well engineered and solidly built. But understand what you're buying the Wrangler for. The Wrangler is a car to buy just for the fun of it.<br><br>
