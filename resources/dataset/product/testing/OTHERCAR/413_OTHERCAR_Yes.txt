            Our old station wagon's transmission decided reverse was all it had to give.  Out of a need for a vehicle that could handle three teenagers and their friends,we kept an ear out for a used car.

I love the van.    
I really don't hate anything about the van,except if my husband drives it!

I never dreamed I'd be a &quot;Suburbia Mom&quot; driving around town in one of &quot;those&quot;!  It seemed that every mom in town had one,they all looked alike-yuch!  I have had two Suburbans in the past,this van sits up high as the Suburbans do.  I get a fabulous view of what is around me and in other,low sitting minivans.  She is easy on gas,with only a six cylinder,I can go for miles and miles!  I easily fit the kids and their gear,or my stuff and even can pack to camp for a week with room to spare.  My husband doesn't care for the lack of leg room-he's 6'3&quot;.  I don't have a problem with it at 5'5&quot;!   The ride is quiet and smooth,almost as if we're floating along!

This vehicle is fantastic for those with children or cargo.  It is a practical van for a practical person!
Sporty,this van is not.  I do not think a teenager would like this one very much!  They do like the stereo!
