            There is no doubt that GM has been trying to position itself into the middle of the profitable Sedan Market.  In fact, it is the same company that brought us Cadillac Deville and the flashy Pontiac Bonneville, Buick LeSabre etc.  In 1999, GM came out with the super sleek Alero that was available in coupe and sedans. The same could be said about the Intrigue. It won some battles in the fight against the 4-cylinder imports such as Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.  More and more, GM is delivering some hot vehicles to the market in an effort to get a share of the young crowd's market.

Smaller and lighter (165 pounds lighter as a V-8 and 285 pounds lighter as a V-6) the redesigned, flashy Aurora is poised to be a headturner.  GM is launching this light pounder against such luxury cars as the Lexus ES 300.  The 2001 Aurora is offered with a V-6 as well as the original V-8.  In this car the Oldsmobile addicts, older crowd as well as the young will see a pearl.  They will jump to it.  At least, that's the hope GM has nurtured!  It is fact that the entry-level midsize sedan market segments are populated by conservative folks.  It remains to see whether GM will create a real dent, forage into the younger import-oriented buyer category.  There is no doubt that the Intrigue has caused a lot of headturning too.

If you are interested in buying a 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora, you can have some options:  Chrome wheels, White metallic paint, and premium stereo system.

It is a smooth vehicle you will be pleased to drive.<br><br>
