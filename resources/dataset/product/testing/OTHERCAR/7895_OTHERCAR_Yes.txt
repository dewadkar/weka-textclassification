            I've been willing to buy a good digital camera for about a year, since I sold my Polaroid PDC 640 (0.3 megapixel). I've done a lot of research and came up to two models: the Fuji Finepix 2560 and the Canon Powershot a20. After visiting a few stores I found the Powershot for US$290 here in Brazil (I'm Brazilian). Of course I gave it no second thought and proudly took it home, and every cent I payed was worth it. I also bought an extra 64Mb CF card for US50.
The camera is extremely easy to use in Automatic mode, and the manual mode is rarely needed. The auto focus is really accurate, unless you are taking pictures with flash in complete darkness, giving the camera no references for focusing.
The flash performance is amazing. This camera flashes twice when taking a picture. The first flash serves as a reference so that the camera is able to accurately calculate the intensity of the second flash, when the picture is taken. As a result, the pictures never come out dark or overexposed, no matter how far you are from the subject (respecting the flash limits, of course).
The LCD is clear and the menus are easy to use once you get used to it, although the navigation may be a little confusing when you use it the first time.
The batteries life is very good if you are using NiMH cells (I payed US12 for a pack of four 1800 mAh). To be honest, I've taken about 250 pictures since I bought the camera and the batteries never ran short. It doesn't come with an AC adaptor, and the one that Canon sells might be a little too expensive. I've found that the "AIWA CD player" AC adaptor works perfectly with this camera (both voltage, polarity and plugs are the same), and a "generic" AIWA adaptor costs less than 5 dollars. Bear in mind that using a non-specific adaptor may damage your camera. Try it at your own risk!
The video out feature is interesting, but quite useless for me. You can show a picture fullscreen on your TV set, zoom it in, show 9 thumbnails at the same time... This camera even has a automatic slide show system.
The USB connection is easy, but requires software installation (unlike the Olympus Camedia series), which is bad when you are traveling and want to upload your pictures on somebody else's computer. The software is lousy, so I recommend installing only the drivers and using any other software for edition.
The zoom is a little noisy, but that seems ok to me. It's easy to use and gives crispy pictures.

<b>UPDATE</b>

The camera stopped working after 3 days. When I returned it, the retailer said he didn't have a new one to replace, so I got my money back. Now I'm looking for a A40.
