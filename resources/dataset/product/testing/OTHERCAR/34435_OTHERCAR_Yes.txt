            I just bought my first new car.  My last car was a 1986 Toyota Camery with 276,000 miles on it.  I started shopping around and thought I would end up getting a Toyota because of the lifespan of my last car.  I was all set to buy a new Corolla when a co-worker insisted I test drive his Saturn.  From the moment I pulled out of the parking lot, I was hooked.

I headed to my nearest Saturn dealer the next day and test drove the 2002 SL2.  I immediately loved driving this car and felt very comfortable both on the highway and on back roads.  I am impressed with the fuel efficiency as well as the user friendly engine lay out.  There is an oil life monitor which indicates when you should change your oil.

I added several extras to my car, including a 12 CD disk changer, fog lights and an automatic sun roof ( a must!).  My car is also automatic and I got the alloy wheels.  All in all the total cost ended up being $20,795.00..which I was in shock over for a Saturn.

There was one problem with the dealership which I was not impressed with.  I was told the total price was $19,795.00 and went to the dealership with a bankcheck in hand on the day I was to pick it up.  When it came time for the paperwork to be finished, I was informed there was a calculation error and that I would have to cough up another $1,000 dollars...oooops!  I was not very happy.  The worst poart, however was the big dog and pony show they put on to show me how sorry they were about the mistake.  The were running around blaming everyone for the mistake and assured me that whatever happened would be corrected.
