            I leased a 1999 Camry Solara in March of 1999.  I had previously leased a Toyota Celica and while I really liked the appearance and performance of the car, I was ready for something bigger and better.  The Solara is awesome!  My girlfriend owns a Lexus and my Solara looks exactly like her Lexus on the inside.  Of course, I'm not paying Lexus prices!  The Solara's ride is smooth and comfortable.  I feel like I'm driving a luxury car for an economy car price!  I always receive compliments on my Solara and would recommend this car to anyone looking for an affordable, luxury-comparable car.  In addition to looking good, this car gets decent gas mileage (400 miles to a tank of mostly city driving) and I have yet to find one thing about the car that I don't like.  The stereo system I got was the standard system and it ROCKS!  I can't imagine what the upgraded system must sound like!  The backseats fold down and VOILA! you can fit more than you could imagine into the car.  Without folding down the seats you could take a family of four on a vacation cross country and still have plenty of room for souvenirs!  As you can tell, I love the car and if you're thinking of buying/leasing one, I say &quot;GO FOR IT!&quot;<br><br>
