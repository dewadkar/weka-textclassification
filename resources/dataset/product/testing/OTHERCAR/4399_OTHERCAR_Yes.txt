            Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving, and the &quot;official&quot; start
of the Christmas buying season -- a day for all to get up at 5am to get the best <br>
prices on the equipment no one wants but everyone needs.
<p>There was me inside Wal-Mart waiting for the 6am bell standing in front of <br>
  a whole pallatte of a brand new camera from Kodak -- the EasyShare CX4300. <br>
  The bell sounded at exactly 6am and before the wrapping was off the cameras <br>
  I snatched as many as I could and raced towards the register. At $155 for a <br>
  3.2MP camera I KNEW I was getting a deal, and sure did I!&lt;/p&gt; <br>
&lt;
  p&gt;With no optical zoom, the camera did lack a very important feature that
  all <br>
  digital cameras should have but again the price drove me back to the camera. <br>
  The ability to synchronize the camera with the EasyShare Dock (sold seperately) <br>
  makes it incredibly easy to share pictures with friends and family, and the <br>
  use of the camera itself is insanely simple.&lt;/p&gt; 
<p><br>
  The camera boasts a resolution that will allow for prints of as large as 11&quot; X <br>
  14&quot; a 2X digital zoom, 16MB of internal memory (expandable with a smart <br>
  card), a crisp clear LCD display, and easy controls. The nice compact size <br>
  of the camera fits perfectly into my laptop bag but could also fit into a purse <br>
  or a large shirt pocket.&lt;/p&gt; 
<p><br>
  The camera only uses 2-AA batteries to operate (no extra battery power needed <br>
  because there isn't an optical zoom) and the life on those has been extraordinary. <br>
  I bought NIMH batteries and a charger with the camera, and with those four <br>
  batteries I have yet to run out of battery power.&lt;/p&gt; 
<p><br>
  Though not the most technologically innovative camera on the market, the CX4300 <br>
  meets the needs of the casual camera user as well as the more experienced user <br>
  who wants to use the camera for prints. The camera really shines when it comes <br>
  to sharing prints over the internet. With the docking station and one click <br>
  of the button, the camera loads the photos to the web with ease.&lt;/p&gt; 
<p><br>
  Downloading pictures onto your computer is also a snap. The camera comes with <br>
  a USB cable that connects to the computer and my machine (WinXP) recognized <br>
  it immediately <br>
  For those looking for a high-resolution digital camera without the frills (and <br>
  frustration) of the more advanced cameras out there, the CX4300 is the best <br>
  of the best out there today.
