              This car is priced right!  Three models to choose from: SE, GT and GTP. The SE model is a value model, standard 3100 V6 provides ample power and great gas mileage.  GT is an appearance package mainly, more aggressive front and back end style.  With a 3800 V6 standard, quick acceleration, smooth running, and fantastic gas mileage.  The GTP is a performance oriented car.  The real difference is a Supercharged 3800 V6 engine and a little button on the shift lever that allows for a performance shift, basically telling the engine to shift at a higher rpm.  All three models are attractive in all aspects, style, price, safety, equipment.  If you are in the market for a mid-size car, you owe it to yourself to check out this car.  You will not be disappointed!!!<br><br>
