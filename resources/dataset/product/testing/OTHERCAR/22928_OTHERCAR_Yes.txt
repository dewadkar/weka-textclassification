            I also had wanted a Jeep for a long time, and finally bought my used '95 Rio Grande a couple years ago.  Overall, it's everything I had wanted and expected, although now that the passion of our new marriage has passed, I have noticed a few, albeit minor, flaws:
  
1) Mine has developed a leak around the windshield channel, so when it rains, or gets washed, water comes in under the dashboard and drips onto the floorboards (or my feet as I'm driving), which has lead to rust forming under the carpet/floormats.
2) The 4cyl. isn't a highway powerhouse (duh), but it really isn't THAT bad.  My Jeep is my daily driver and I comfortably cruise at 65-75 on the highway without redlining.
3) I got the hardtop(that's what it came with), and no A/C.  It's my own fault, but MAN does it get hot.  This past summer was like driving around with a hair dryer blowing in my face.  I do have plans to get a soft top.

With all that being said, I still love my Jeep and drive it about 30 miles a day, on highway and nasty pothole-ridden city streets.  Sure it's bumpy, but you gotta know that before you buy it!  I've taken it hunting, and although it doesn't have the room a pick-up would, I managed to pack gear for a week-long trip, and even brought a nice deer home with me this past season, although I don't think he enjoyed the ride as much as I did.  My 3 year old daughter loves my Jeep and frequently asks to go for "Jeep rides", and when given a choice will often choose to ride with me instead of in Mom's Camry.  I haven't taken the time to really wring it out off-road, but the few occassions where I have put it in 4WD, it's performed superbly, leaving me longing to take a day off and head for the hills.  You can pick any vehicle apart if you're so inclined, and Jeeps aren't for everyone, but I ain't getting rid of mine.
