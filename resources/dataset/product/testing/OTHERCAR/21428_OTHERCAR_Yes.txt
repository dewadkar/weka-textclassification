            To start off, this is my second Hyundai. The first was a Santa Fe which is now resting in peace, which there is a seperate review. 

After my Santa Fe was written off, I decided that I should return to Hyundai and see what they have to offer this time around. Once again I hunted around and within 50 seconds a dealer came flying at me. I just happened to be sitting in front of an Elantra VE, which is the Canadian version of the GLS. The dealer grabbed a plate stuck it on the trunk and handed me the keys. She told me to go ahead and have fun.

So I get in while exteriorly pleasing, the interior seemd kind of boring. Right off the bat I noticed there was no armrest in between the driver and passenger which was sort of a let down however the interior is well built and very functional. It has all the toys, power everything, an automatic which is standard on this trim which was shocking, cd player, a/c. The stereo on these cars are a clarion which does stick out and the buttons are too small. It looks like it doesn't belong. The heater controls are also very boring but have their advantages, simplicity being the most popular one for me. On and off for the a/c recirculate and a knob to ajust the tempurature. 

So off I go. First things first the elantra handles beautifully, its power steering i quick and precise without being too overboosted, the acceleration is quick, comparable to a many sports cars like a cavalier z24, and its automatic shifted rather nicely. The cabin is fairly quiet all though when pushed you can definitally hear the engine and bumps on the road. You cant feel them but you know they are there. The seats are wll padded and very supportave. This model had an adjustable lumbar support, which for me while only being 19, feels good. Note as well I do have a very badly curved back. 

I brought it back and the dealer was happy to see me and we went over all the features both inside and out. Its trunk is rather large, and the seats do fold down, even though the call it a 60/40 I belive it is more like 70/30. The rear seat in the car is surprisinly bigger then it looks. Im 6"0 180 pounds and I fit comfortably back there, except the front seats seem to have more room. Outside the most striking feature is its styling, its rear end does look somewhat different, but its front end resembles a BMW with its circlular headlights. It looks beautiful.

So, after the second test drive, I bought it. $20,000 canadian, No money down. No problems with the credit board which is a problem with 19 year olds. I wanted floor mats and keyless entry which were extra and she said I could pick up the car tomorrow. 

Insurance for this car is a bit higher then was expected, but it is brand new, I dont have a solid gold driving record, and im only 19. Being a guy has higher insurance here. I rushed off, got my plated and picked it up. They had vaccumed it, installed everything, took 2 pictures and went off on my way. They also offered to wash my car any time. Just bring it in. Free of charge. I nice offer, but Ill do it myself. Im not that lazy. :)

Ill update this review as I go along. Overall Im very impressed with the service and the car itself. I have already had a few of my freinds ask me how I afford a BMW, and that they didnt know Honda made those. Im always forced to correct them on it and am considering sending email to Hyundai to change thier logo. Its too similar to Honda's :)

First update.
Well Im into the first week and no problems thus far. I recently just put 1400 kms on the car on a small road trip. Fuel economy is really good compared to other cars of its class. But one thing Im really starting to detest. The door chime. Unlike other chars which have a very soft "bing..... bing... " noise this car sounds like my doorbell. "DINGDONGDINDONG..." It sound so mechanical that it sounds like theres a little guy in my dashboard with a mallet and two cymbals! Also the stereo's bass is a bit too weak for my tastes, nothing a subwoofer cant fix. All In all the car is surviving me!
