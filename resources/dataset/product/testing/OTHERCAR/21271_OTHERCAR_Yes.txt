            Lots of reviews of Camrys out there, so I won't repeat general knowledge. However, here are a few thoughts

A used 95 LE, in good condition should

* run very smoothly
* be very quite at highway and stop-and-go speeds
* shift very smoothly
* have lots of acceleration

In general there are only a few problems with the Camry '95.  

* It's a little hard to see out of.  The windows are just not as tall as in some other cars, like the accord.
* The steering wheel is so smooth that it can be kind of tiring to hold.
* When using the cruise control on downhill highway driving, the car will sometimes go into a mildly distracting surging pattern. Not enough to make the spedomitor move, but enough to be annoying.

If you like boring, conservative cars, this is really one of the best out there. <br><br>
