            <b>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME FIRST:</b>       

I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for from the advisors here at epinions, and make your choice.

<b>YOUR SUBARU SUSPENSION &amp; STEERING SYSTEM:</b>


    I have nothing to say bad about the underneath of the Legacy/Loyale/Outback/Forester models, or most other newer Subaru vehicles for that matter. I have been working on cars for long enough to know when somebody gets it right in the suspension area, and subaru nailed it on this one ! <i>*SEE FOOTNOTE ON BOTTOM</i>

   First off, they allow alignment specialists to actually adjust the angles, which is a good thing. Most other foreign (and domestic cars for that matter) only allow for toe in/ toe out settings, but with the Subaru they allow for front camber adjustment. This is important in that when the coil springs weaken the camber angle will change, and if you can't adjust it back to factory spec., you will end up with excessive tire wear.

  The rear toe is also factory adjustable so there is no need to upset the rear suspension by needing to shim it, should it require adjustment, you just loosen the cam bolts and back in business. The camber, though not adjustable, can be altered with the bolt slop in the strut to knuckle mounting holes. While you won't get much, it may be enough to add enough to get it closer to where it should be.

  The tie rods and ball joints, though not factory greasable should hold up very well as evidenced by the fact that I don't really remember ever replacing any, and I've seen a few with over 200,000 miles on them, not newer models, but it is the same design since the legacy was introduced long ago, so obviously if it aint broke, don't fix it. The metal used in the construction of these parts is definitely of high standard.

   Ride quality in these vehicles is mostly plush and tight. You do get anti sway bars front and rear, but the size is nothing ro write home about, but since there is not a great deal of weight being thrown around it really doesn't require bars the size of larger SUV types. The ride height is more than the standard Legacy, adding to the SUV feel, but with the above mentioned anti sway system and relatively low weight, you won't get that top heavy-I'm-gonna tip over rush. 

   The four struts are gas charged units, but not of the highly charged variety that transfers to a bouncy or harsh road feel. Off road they also shine, soaking up all but the hugest bumps, leaving those for the biggest of monster trucks, and you don't wanna go there.

   I recieved an e-mail recently from an epinion member who was having a problem with the rear suspension bouncing a lot and didn't seem to be getting satisfaction from their dealer in handling the problem. The vehicle was used in towing circumstances, and so far this was the first problem I have encountered in the suspension system. So if this becomes a problem straight across the board with these under a towing load I'll keep you posted.

  <b>ONE WORD OF CAUTION:</b>

 For some reason the factory alignment settings seem to get upset in shipping or transport, because I have seen nearly new vehicles very far out of alignment. So if you decide to own one of these, make sure to take it to a reputable alignment shop and at least have them check the alignment so your first set of tires don't get ruined.

   Now get in your shiny new Subaru and have a ball. You won't need to worry about the suspension a bit. Read the reviews on the other aspects of this vehicle and make your choice, see if it's right for you, because the undercar view is a very strong one. The whole Subaru line is one of the best quality suspensions in design and execution I've ever come across. <b>You will not be disappointed.</b>


<b>Footnote:</b>

<i>The Legacy, Outback, and Forester are the best. The Loyale is only about 1/2 step down in quality with the 2wd version of any having a different rear alignment set-up.  Still excellent caliber all around nevertheless. The suspensions on these vehicles are nearly identicle. If not completely the same part by part, the design and engineering is a mirror image of each.</i>
