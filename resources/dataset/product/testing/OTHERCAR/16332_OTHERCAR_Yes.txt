            I am thrilled with my new Hp C200 Photo Smart Digital Camera.  It came as a package deal, because we also purchased the HP Photo Smart Printer with it.  As a package deal, we also got a $100 rebate so our total price was comparable to just one medium quality digital camera! 

 Anyhow, for a first-time owner of a digital camera, I am more than pleased with its performance and quality of photos it has taken so far!  Actually, it is better than I imagined. 

 I took the camera to a Christmas Party and everyone was so interested in it and I spent most of my time giving everyone information about it.  It's too bad I'm not in the business of selling them, as I could have made a killing that day! 

 The camera sells itself.  That is the one reason we purchased it in the first place.  When my husband and I were in Office Depot one afternoon, it was our intention to merely check prices, etc.  When a sales representative came up and took out photo and showed us the results, in as quick as a few minutes, we were amazed!  I was really surprised when my husband said he thought we should get it!!  And he doesn't even have an interest in computers, etc.

  I have gotten so much use from it already and it's not even a month old.  Digital cameras are the wave of the future and I know I will get my money's worth out of this one.  If anyone is even thinking of getting a digital camera, this would be my first pick!!!<br><br>
