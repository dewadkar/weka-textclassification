            ** Sorry this is soooo long**

We bought our 2001 Honda Odyssey in May 2001 when my 8 year old Ford Aerostar (my 2nd Aerostar, by the way) died a horrible, too expensive to repair death.  Taking on a car payment was not high on our list of things to do that year, but I needed good, reliable transportation.  So we set out to find the new van to park in our garage.  We read all the reviews we could get our hands on and decided on the Odyssey.  Honda has a great reputation for reliable vehicles with high resale value.  Wow - what a change from Ford!

So...we headed down to our local Honda dealer only to find they had NO Odysseys on the lot.  A shipment was expected from Canada within the week.  When those 3 vans arrived, we hurried over and crawled in and over and under the Odyssey.  Our kids got a big kick out of the power doors and I loved the "magic" 3rd row seat and the ease of removing the second row captain's seats.  We were bummed that leather wasn't available but the cloth wasn't too bad (it does stain ALOT easier, though - especially with 3 kids and a dog!)  I liked how spunky it was - I do have a "bit" of a lead foot!  And it seemed to have a nice package of basic features - keyless entry, climate control, rear a/c.  Being the curious thing that I am, I convinced my husband that we needed to at least look at some other models -just to compare.  Well, we ended up back at the Honda dealership.

Boy, Honda dealers sure think they are Gods!  Not only would they not even consider cutting any kind of deal with us, they upped the MSRP by $2000.  Then we found out that these Odysseys were considered "used" because they were purchased by the dealership in Canada!  They only had 10 miles on them!  Because they were not made for the US market, the Honda warrantee was void.  But the dealer would provide a warrantee that was the same (minus any recalls, etc.)  The controls/temp were in metric/celsius.  Something I "would get use to" the salesperson said.  Yea - so, we went a hunting and ended up 60 miles away where a brand new, American Odyssey was just waiting for us.  That dealer sold us the van for $26,000 (sticker was $27,300). We were thrilled!  A few weeks later, we took a 2 week driving trip (put on over 4000 miles!) and were still pretty pleased - but we started noticing a few annoying things about the Odyssey.....

1.  The folding center console tray - my purse strap always gets caught on the handle to fold the tray causing the tray to collapse, especially when the cup holders are loaded with coffee or Coca Cola! 

2.  The cup holders are way too shallow - I can't begin to tell you how many times I've arrived at work wearing my coffee because the cup tipped out on a curve.  I have even complained to Honda about this one.  I know cup holders are a silly,tiny part of car ownership, but jeez!  How hard could it be to design functional cup holders?

3.  The stereo is awful. Very poor quality.

4.  The Odyssey is one of the loudest newer cars I have ever rode in.  To hold a conversation with people in the backseats, you have to yell.  Not very pleasant!

5.  The seats are not particularly comfortable.

6.  No leather upholstery.

7.  This is the icing on the cake - I actually got STUCK in the power door today!  Stuck!  I have bruises down both arms from the door shutting on me.  It's suppose to "sense" an obstruction and reverse....RIGHT!  It wouldn't stop even with me putting all of my weight against the door.  Now imagine that happening to your toddler!  I'll be turning that feature off until Honda service fixes this problem!

8.  No power lift gate.

9.  The power port/lighter is in a hard to reach place, almost on the floor.

10. The controls are hard to see - blocked by the steering wheel, turn signal handle and shifter.

11. The gas mileage is not good at all.  I got better mileage in my Aerostar - go figure!!

12. There aren't enough color choices of this van - I don't like seeing "my" van everywhere I go.  I had to put an obnoxious antenna ball on it so I could pick it out in a parking lot.

13. Withing the first few months, a dashboard rattle started which the service dept can not locate!!!

It does have some good qualities.  I still love the 3rd row seat and the ease of removing the 2nd row.  It handles and brakes nice.  It's very roomy.  And when I trade it in or sell it in the next month or so, I'll get a good price for it.
