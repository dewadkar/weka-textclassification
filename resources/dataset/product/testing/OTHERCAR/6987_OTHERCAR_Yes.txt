             I got a blazer for my 16th birthday that my mom had bought me. I have been very pleased with the performance of this vehicle. When I first got it tho I had to have a new transfer case installed because the other wouldnt work. When we finally got that all taken care of we had to go and replace the Idler arm and one other thing not sure what it was called tho. It kept me from being able to get my car aligned. Although we thought we had the transfer case fixed last winter I tried to use the 4x4 and the 4-lo made an aweful noise. Not sure what it was but its still broken.

  Later on I started smelling a foul smell inside the car and started to investigate it. I found that the heater core had gone bad an cracked. There was anti-freeze leaking into my passenger side. IT was a mess. Let me tell you trying to change anything on this car is not easy. My dad and i had to take out the dash to get to it and then take it out and replace it. 

  We have also had to replace the radiator and the starter. My vehicle has only a little less than 92,000 mile on it. I guess i cant expect nothing to go wrong with it considering its age but that is alot. The car is running farely well now and have not had any major happenings with it for a while. 

  The steering is fairly tight. Its nothiong like driving a new car but its not like driving a tank. It is fairly responsive. I dont have a problem with it. The gas milage isnt all that great. I have never tested it to see what I actually am getting but need to. 

  The one thing i dont really car for is the place they have the jack stored. Its to hard to get to. You have to remove the spare tire off the side of the inside and then get to it and it males noise if not packed just right. I have no dislikes about this cars features other than that. This car performs excellent on ice and snow. We had some ice last year and the streets were like covered in a sheet of ice practically. I popped it into 4HI and I was off. I only side once that i can remember when i was turning a corner but didnt loose control at all. I think the reason it does so well is the weight the suv's have in the back.

  The car does make noise in the back window we think. Its either the latch on the glass and the door rubbing or the door it self but not real sure. The luggage rack does fade in color faster than the car. Also there the tiniest rust spots on the back roof by the outside brake light. All in all this is a great car despite all the things that have happened.
