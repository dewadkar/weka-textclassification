            I've had my LS for four months and 5K miles and have enjoyed driving it.  We've taken several trips and we're pleased with the ride and the mileage (31 mpg interstate).  We got a good deal on the price, as I'm sure everyone did this year, which sweetens the experience.  We love the large trunk which will accommodate luggage and golf bags for two with room to spare.  The dual temperature controls are a God send, too - I no longer have to suffer driving with my cold natured wife.  The only negative item I've noticed to date is that they engineered the heating - a/c controls such that in some positions (e.g. defog) the selector automatically sucks in outside air without the ability to switch to recirculate.  This has got to be less efficient in the winter when you're warming the car up and uncomfortable when driving past a paper mill or behind a livestock truck.  Chevrolet engineers - are you listening? The car also has a sporty appearance and is roomier inside than it appears.  Another negative, IMHO, is the manner in which a front license plate is mounted on this vehicle.  It is necessary to actually drill holes in the front bumper into which you directly screw the mounting screws.  I've always had a college plate on the front, but don't want to ruin the appearance of the car by drilling holes in the bumper.  They should have engineered a front plate mounting bracket of some sort.  Chevrolet engineers - yo-hoo......  Oh yeah, I'd like to have mud guards - or at least have them available for purchase from the dealer as an option.
