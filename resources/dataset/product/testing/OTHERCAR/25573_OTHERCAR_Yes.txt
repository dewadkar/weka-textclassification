            Okay, this is probably the only vehicle 007 drove that I will ever be able to afford in my lifetime. Mine even has the same 'Atlanta Blue' color. (light metallic blue) I'm pretty much driving the most inexpensive trim level that was ever offered in a Z3. It is the 4-cyl engine (M44), with leatherette seats and a manual transmission. It does come however with power seats and traction control.

But the image of the vehicle aside, let's get down to the basics. My review will be somewhat of a comparison, because I have also owned a 1997 Mazda Miata and a colleague of mine drives a 1997 Z3 with the 2.8L I6 (M52) engine.

I've purchased this vehicle in Feb. '01 as a replacement of my Miata, which I had sold prior to my move to California. I chose the Z3 partly because of it looks, but also of it's refined handling. It also helped that the 4-cyl. model is not very popular in the US, and I was able to buy it used at what I perceived to be a very good price.

<b>Engine</b>
The engine is lively, but refined. The exhaust note is very subdued compared to a Mazda Miata. It provides decent power under all normal driving conditions. But please, don't try to outrace anybody at a stoplight.

<b>Manual Transmission</b>
It is one of the big advantages of the vehicle. The shifter seems to know what gear you want to shift into. The throws are short, but one can clearly feel when the gear is engaged. The fifth and the reverse gear have a different feel to them, making it impossible you shift into the wrong gear.
The clutch engages/disengages early and very precise. The pedal travel is short, but requires some force. 

<b> Suspension and Handling </b>
This car handles well. There is no other way to put it. However, the suspension is softer than my Miata's. But I can comfortably drive the Z3 over long periods of time, which was not always the case in the Miata.
The brakes are fabulous. They engage early, modulate easily and stop the vehicle with authority. 

<b> Interior </b>
The interior is not fancy at all, but keep in mind that this is the base version of the Z3. Some interior parts feel a little too cheap, though. I had the BMW dealer fix the driver seat rails, the glovebox latch and the window seals under warranty.
But the ergonomics are practical, which the exception of the optional cupholders. (But hey, you don't eat or drink in a German car.)
The trunk is tiny. The golf clubs might fit, but that's about it. This is okay for most day trips, though.

I've also test driven the 2.8L version. I did not like the manual transmission nearly as much, but that might be a personal preference. The 2.8L just plain takes off at 3000 rpm, though. It also comes with a wider rear body and wider rear tires, giving the vehicle more of a muscle car look. The engine is also much heavier, which can be noticed during corner handling.
If your ego cannot handle your Bimmer being outraced by Ford Mustang, this is the engine configuration for you. But be prepared to pay much more for the car.

Overall, I cannot think of a better car to cruise down Highway 1 on a spring day. You probably won't feel the urge to race anybody, but you'll have lots of fun cruising.

And before I forget, this is a certified used vehicle. The service level I received from BMW was one par with any new car service I've received so far. A very positive experience.
