            We purchased a 96 Neon in November of '98. I loved the way the car handled and it was so cute. The Neon was comfortably in our price range and seemed to be the most car for our money and the one we purchased made me feel like we bought a safe car.  I was in heaven having my first car that was less than five years old.  But heaven isn�t where I stayed.

Now a year and a half later, I still like the car (now that it's fixed) but will never purchase another Chrysler product because of the deceptive way they do business. 

<i><b>What could they have done that was so wrong? </b></i>
We discovered (<i>the hard way</i>) there was a defect in the head gasket design in pre-99 models and Chrysler <i>knew about it</i>.  It was never recalled because it isn�t technically a safety issue, but as far as I am concerned it is a HUGE consumer fraud issue.

<i><b>What happened and what we did about it�</b></i>
After losing almost all my oil one day, we got it to our nearest Dodge dealer and were told that this was a very common problem for Neon�s.  The repair was expensive; about $800.00 to fix at the dealership we went to first. Now, if the service department manager had not made the comment that it was "common" for Neon�s to have this problem, I would have thought it was our own bad luck and would have left it at that, and we would have gotten it fixed. But this comment prompted me to look into this. I called other dealerships and to my surprise other mechanics said the same thing. I called Chrysler and they agreed to have a dealership look at it so we could "see" if there was anything they could do to help. 

Since my appointment was a few days away, I got online and was referred to check out the Traffic and Highway Safety Administration. (www.nhtsa.dot.gov) I was astounded to find over 25 pages of consumer complaints regarding the defective head gasket and how many consumers were left out in the cold by Chrysler and had to replace the defective part at their own expense. The recurring theme was how many people were told by their dealerships that it was such a common problem. I thought that was rather incriminating and that Chrysler should have to take responsibility if it was really this big of a problem. The Website www.neons.org suggests that 32% of Neon�s owners have replaced this part. Now if this is accurate, then that is a VERY high percentage. 

Armed with this info, I called Chrysler back and after going through countless departments and supervisors I got them to agree to pay for half the repair. 

I felt they were very dishonest and I would not recommend buying a pre-99 Neon unless you know for a fact that the head gasket has already been replaced with the newly designed part. For a car that has only been on the market about 5 years or so, there really should not be that many of them with enough miles to have this problem. I realize this can happen in any car at any time, but this seemed all too common for Neon.

It really is too bad that Chrysler didn�t stand up for their product right away by voluntarily issuing a recall or by at least fixing the cars that were affected before the part was redesigned.  

Neon really is a fun, cute little car to drive. The gas mileage is phenomenal (at least for me).  It is deceptively roomy and comfortable enough for me to drive it 3000 miles round trip a few times a year to visit my father.  Aside for the gasket problem the maintenance has been easy.  

But these things do not make up for the experience I had dealing with Dodge on a problem that was caused by poor design.  The fact that the head gasket was defective really is not what made me so mad; it was the reluctance of Chrysler to do the right thing that has turned me away forever.

<i>Update - May 2001</i>
After only 5 years (which, to me isn't that old) the air conditioning system has gone bad in spite of yearly maintenance checks. Not just one component either. First, the evaporator started leaking and just recently the compressor burned out.

<i>Update - August 2002</I>
Surprisingly, I still have this car.  And as I have always said, it's a fun car to drive and still gets really great gas mileage.  Aside from the head gasket repair and the A/C going out I have not had any significant problems with this car.

That is, untill the last few weeks when I discovered that I have begun once again, to <i> leak oil</i>.  I had a small oil leak last fall that wasn't related to the head gasket and had it fixed.  I was horrified today to be told that my head gasket is leaking oil.  I was told that my head gasket was replaced with the redesigned one when it was repaired last time.  I have started to doubt this, since the head gasket problems seem to end when the redesigned part is used.  So, once again I will have to face off with Chrysler.  This is the third head gasket leak.  This time I will insist that Chrysler step up and fix the repair. 

 

I really appreciate all the good feedback I have received from this review.  I am proud to say that I have helped six people get head gasket repairs from Chrysler; two for free and the others paid half as I did.

In case the question has crossed your mind....I do plan on getting rid of this car next spring.  I'm a glutton for punishment I guess....

<i><b>If you have had the same problem call Chrysler @ 1-800-992-1997!</b></i> If enough people complain perhaps Chrysler will be forced to take financial responsibility to avoid consumer fraud charges and reimburse Neon owners who have paid for this repair!

<i>Go to the Traffic and Highway Safety Administration if you want to complain or do research for any vehicle (especially Neon!). </i>
