            I purchased the DC-210 Plus Zoom camera a year and a half ago and I use it frequently. It has been quite enjoyable to use.  Before I bought this camera, I did a lot of comparison shopping and was deciding between the DC-210 and the Sony digital camera.  Basically, I was debating between using flash memory or 3 1/2&quot; floppies.  I came to the conclusion of getting the DC-210 because I did not want to lug 20 floppy disks around on my vacations.

I have used this camera to take pictures of my family's vacation and pictures for my website.  I haven't had to upgrade the flash memory from what I purchased, 2 MB.  I just download the photos after it is full.  My camera is still the spotlight of any party that I bring it too.  Everyone thinks that it is &quot;so cool&quot;.

When I bought this camera, I was using regular store-bought batteries, and my camera sucked them dry.  Now, I use nicad batteries and get a lot more like out of them AND keep money in my wallet.  The only thing you will still have to shell out bucks for is photo paper, if you plan on printing the photos.  I use an Epson Stylus Photo 800 for printing and I get very sharp results.  Make sure you use ink jet photo paper for the best results.

As for the synch-up to the computer, it does take a while to download the pictures, however if you get a used camera, make sure you visit Kodak's site (www.kodak.com) and download the recent flash update for the camera.  It will give you a slightly better download rate than the original software.

After a year and half with the camera, the quality is still there and I have never needed to have it serviced.  I have been very pleased with Kodak's DC-210 and hope to be for years to come.  I highly recommend it.<br><br>
