            This car, to me, competes against near-luxury cars, although it does not have quality of a Lexus or Acura. But after renting one, I decided to go ahead and buy one.

When I bought the car, I found the seats to be very comfortable, the engine smooth and powerful, and excellent attention to fit and finish.  I negotiated with the dealer, and picked one up for $21,500.  This included an extended warranty, which extends the 100,000 10 year powertrain warranty to be "bumper-to-bumper."

I could love the car, but I am disappointed.  First, the handling is way to soft for my tastes. Those who want handling in a car should avoid this.  That I could put up with for the price, but what really irks me is Hyundai's poor service.  

I've had a couple of minor problems, and in each case they first deny the problem exists.  Then I have to make another trip to the dealer, and then they attempt repair.  Then on the third or fourth trip they get it right.  To me, such hassle is just not worth ever buying a Hyundai again.

The problems have been discoloration in the dash cover (they have yet to fix it--I'm waiting to see the district service manager), the way the transmission shifts, the effectiveness of the air conditioning, and a few other problems.  They both still allow me to drive the car, although the transmission problem is the most serious.

For the price and features, I could handle a few problems.  But I've now been to two dealers their lack of attention to fixing it and the way I have been treated reminds me of GM in the '70's.  Perhaps I am more sensitive to service than most, but unless I see a marked change, I will never buy a Hyundai again.
