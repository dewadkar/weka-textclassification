            We have a 1994 Plymouth Voyager.  We really enjoy it.  The front seats are comfortable for medium to short trips.  On long trips it can get a little uncomfortable.  The second seat is very roomy.  The back seat is great for small children.  We have a 13 year old, a 7 year old, a 5 year old and a 2 year old.  The back seat is fine for the 5 and 2 year olds but the older two children are uncomfortable in the back seat.  The 13 year old will only fit in the side of the seat closest to the side door.  A wonderful plus in this vehicle is the sliding back seat.  The back seat folds down and has 3 different positions for the location along a slide bar.  The middle seat does not fold down or slide.<br><br>
