            I bought a used '94 Jetta GL in 1998. I have been very pleased with the car. The comfort level is above most other cars that I have driven. When they say that they make Volkswagen's for the driver's pleasure, I believe it. The car handles exceptionally well and has a lot of pick up for a 4 cylinder. I have had problems with the AC, but other than that, it has been a very reliable car. The sun roof adds a little touch of class to the car. The front seats are very roomy and comfortable, however, the back is a little cramped. The controls are very easy to use and easily accessible while driving. Overall, I would recommend a Jetta to anyone searching for a dependable used car.<br><br>
