            I bought my 1998 Chevy Malibu LS about a month ago.  So far, I think it is a great car (although, I have seen some opinions that would state otherwise).  Now, you never know, I may be on here in another year or so mourning the day I ever bought my Malibu, but hey, for the present I like everything about it except for the name.  Okay, I have to say this about it's name...it reminds me of that stupid Malibu Barbie doll.  I feel like I need to be a blonde with no brains to drive this car.  I mean, come on, I doubt there are too many men who own a Chevy Malibu who just love the name of their car.  Well, just because I have a girl car doesn't mean I want the name to sound like something off of a Barbie box...you know?!  Alright, forward with this bit of writing.

I paid about $10,500 for my '98 Malibu.  It is a four door burgundy car with V-6 engine, anti-lock brakes (which allow you to steer while you brake), a CD player, tape player, AM/FM radio (a nice little sound system), AC, heat, a huge trunk, plenty of room for your legs and anything else, daytime running lights, map lights on your rearview mirror, and pretty much power everything.  The only thing I do not like about having power everything is the fact that it is just more stuff to go wrong with the car.  I miss the days of manual everything, but then I guess people have enough to distract them while they drive that they don't need anything else.  Another thing is that this car is kind of a gas guzzler...I attribute that to the fact that it is a V-6 engine.  I will not complain about having a V-6 though, because when you need to stomp on it, it doesn't sound like you are killing the engine.  That always irritated me when I had my 1992 Plymouth Sundance (feel free to read that review as well, if you like).  A V-4 engine sounds like "dear God, what is this crazy driver trying to do to me, I'm not meant to go at speeds past 20 MPH, please stop or I'll scream!"  Yeah, one thing I do not miss about my old car...though it did take good care of me for a long time.

All in all, I'm very pleased with my new car.  If I have any problems with it, I'll be sure to edit this later on, but so far, I feel my new Malibu (arghhhh!!! that name) is well worth the buy.  It is a comfortable, affordable step up into a decent ride with some get up and go to it and plenty of space for passengers and groceries.  Now if only I could get the name changed...

Thank you for reading and good day to you all!
