            Until I moved to Vermont 10 years ago, I had never even been a passenger in, never mind driven, a truck.  Well, maybe once when I was hitchhiking... Anyway, if you live in our part of Vermont, you deal with a few things that are different from what folks deal with elsewhere: different snow conditions, different (usually less maintained, narrower) roads, different kinds of burdens to tote around, etc.
In particular, we live on a class 3 dirt road (graded and plowed OK, but not high on the towns priority list sometimes) with a class 4-1/2 driveway (1/3 mile, 45ï¿½ angle uphill, s-curve and rutted with a 20 foot drop along one side). For the first few years I had a 1991 2-wd Toyota truck (the little one, light and fuel efficient), but after one too many unplanned off-road experiences, I upgraded a year ago to a '98 Tacoma 4x4, extra cab, 5-speed.  I used to run studded snows on the old truck and still had problems in snow, ice and mud conditions. I have all-seasons (with 30K miles on 'em) now, and have yet to get stuck or go off the road.
I also have 2 teenage kids and a big dog.  The extra-cab means we can travel together, run errands as a family, go grocery shopping and fill up the back seat, whatever, and not have to plan too much in advance. The truck bed holds 17 bales of hay, which is crucial to the well-being of our horse, sheep and angora goats. It goes into the woods to my wood lot, out the pasture road to fix fences, up the hill to get the newspaper, and is just as good and comfortable on the highway at 65 mph.
Before I got my first truck, I drove a Ford Maverick, a Chevette, a Ford Fairmont station wagon, and a Subaru station wagon, all automatics.  I would never buy another of any of them.  My wife has a Rav4 now, so we are a convinced and confirmed Toyota family. They run, they start in the coldest weather we get in Vermont, they are comfortable and fun to drive (that's partly due to the 5-speed transmission). It is absolutely uncomplicated to lock the hubs and shift to 4-wheel.  The tape decks are even of very good quality. Any repairs we've had to make have either been under warranty or have been because of minor accidents. I am not at all competent at maintenance or mechanical stuff in general, but even I have been able to do some of my own service at home (replace headlight bulbs, oil and filter changes, etc.). Will I buy another Toyota truck? Absolutely.<br><br>
