            I researched thoroughly when recently trying to decide which digital camera to buy; they are still comparatively expensive items and I wanted to eke out every last drop of value for my money.  Initially I was going to buy the well-priced Minolta Dimage 7i on account of its flexible zoom, top quality lens, and 5MP resolution. However, on seeing the shots produced I felt that for the extra outlay the shots were not as good as examples from the Canon Powershot range that I'd seen. The Minolta suffers somewhat from excessive noise, even at lower ISO settings, whereas that is not an issue with the Canons.

I got the chance to borrow the Minolta and found that it was also a bit bulky for my needs and once more found all roads leading to Canon. After some more spec checks online, a going over of a friends Olympus, and a look at some Nikons, I narrowed my choice down to either the Canon Powershot G2 or its newer sibling the G3.
 
If money had been no object then I may well have gone with the G3, but as it was I found little in the specs to justify buying it over the consequently discounted G2 (great prices available right now). So I went for the G2 and I haven't been disappointed - the camera is everything I wanted and more.
 
If you're a beginner you'll appreciate a camera you can use immediately but can also grow with considerably, this camera positively encourages you to become creative. If you have any experience, you should find the SLR-type feature set can handle almost anything you throw at it - inspiring you to great photographs and allowing you to focus on the advantages digital brings rather than what you're giving up by moving from film. Rest assured that image quality is fantastic, especially in RAW mode. The controls are intuitive enough to negate needing recourse to the albeit comprehensive manuals.
 
Build is impeccable, it feels nice and solid, whilst the quality of the lens is as you would expect for a camera at this price. The degree of control is first-rate and the swivel LCD is one of the best available on any digicam full stop. You will find the results astound you. Add in one of the longest lasting batteries there is (you&#146ll be laughing in the faces of those other digicam users as they run out of juice and you&#146re still shooting!), with a fairly fast &#145drive&#146, wireless remote, and a capable flash, and you&#146re on to a winner. I have yet to find an unnecessary or gimmicky feature, even the panoramic stitch mode works well. The rest of the bundled software is pretty good too.
 
My only (minor) niggles are that the AF can sometimes be a trifle slow to lock onto low contrast subjects (although rarely an issue), the lack of threads on the lens (you need an adaptor for filters), and the tripod mount is out of position with the lens (bothersome for those panoramas). In addition, the manual focus is not really accurate or fast enough to totally rely on - you're really just looking for the highest degree of contrast through the LCD which can be hit and miss. I wish there was a ring on the lens barrel for manual focus, but alas&#133 I don&#146t find the somewhat slow start up time an issue (it is still quick enough), or the fact that the battery must be charged in the camera. If that is problem there are accessory chargers from Canon and third-parties widely available (and with car cigar lighter plugs).

I would add that if you are expecting modern SLR-type performance you might be disappointed as this is a very different beast. This relates in particular to auto-focus speed, tracking, and shots per second. There will be some captures that just aren't possible with this camera but that is no different to any competitor at this price. While the G2 is reasonably quick for a prosumer camera it is painfully slow if you're used to decent-spec film SLRs.  You either have to adapt as best you can as a photographer or (at least) double the amount you want to spend and buy a DSLR. Finally in this regard, DSLR cameras tend to have much larger sensors which manifest in less noisy images at higher ISO settings. The G2 is pretty much noise free at ISOs 50 and 100 but thereafter does get progressively noisy. Whether this is acceptable to you is subjective and there are various software solutions which will help (Neat Image is the best I think), as well as several usable workarounds. I would advise looking at the review here: http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canong2/default.asp for examples of image quality and so on.

The clinchers that swayed me towards the Canon Powershot range were that they can accept several converter lenses and a proper external TTL flash, meaning that ultimately I can get as much or even more flexibility than most competitors offer. There is also a vast amount of third-party software and several useful user communities available online, life as a G2 owner can extend much further than the camera you unpacked from the box.

[NB: The $ price I include is converted from the UK price I paid of ï¿½429. I notice that the usual dollar price is somewhat lower, pretty predictable as we are considerably ripped-off for most items on this side of the Atlantic.]
