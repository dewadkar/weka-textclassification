                 This is my first car and it is an absolute dream to drive. Before getting my own car I had had the experience of driving a Wrangler, a Lexus ES300 and a Mercedes S420. Of these cars the Wrangler made me feel unsafe, the Lexus had slow to no pickup and the Mercedes was a boat; granted it was a nice boat, but a boat none the less. On the contrary my new Jetta has amazing pickup, tight handling, a comfortable interior and stop-on-the-dime braking. I unfortunately had the experience of testing out the braking personally; trust me they work wonderfully! 

     I got just about every option that the Jetta GLS came with. I have black leather interior, a in-dash cd player, a killer sound system (which by the way came free of charge with the car), a romantic moon roof which turns into a fun summer sun roof, and the big V6 engine. (The engine is a must!). Merging onto highways was my biggest fear in driving before I got this car, I was never able to pick up speed fast enough. Now I have no trouble getting on because of this car's zippiness. 

     I've owned this car for over a year now and have had absolutely no problems with it. It is the perfect combination of a luxury car and a sports car, having comfort, style and speed all in one. Anyone who finds driving enjoyable should take a serious look at this car. The only problem that I have had with my car is that the ashtray in the back is located right on the footrest of the middle seat, and a passenger of mine accidently kicked it. It has been broken ever since. You may say this is a fluke, but the ashtray has been broken in every other Jetta I have been in.(3). Other than the ashtray the car has excellent engineering and is made from quality materials. And to top it all off is unbelievably safe too, having both front and side airbags.

    Can't step up to Lexus's new IS or BMW's 3 series? This car is a perfect substitute for those on a budget.
