            This is my first brand new car.  I have always resisted buying new, but with the 2003's on their way out, you can get really good deals right now (mine was at invoice, true cost of option package not the markup, 100k/10 year warranty and lifetime oil change) all for less than what the MSRP was.

After driving it for only 1,000 miles, the performance is excellent. 

Gas mileage is what was claimed on the sale sticker.  I can't stand when idiots complain about their MPG when it is plainly listed on the sticker.  Also MPG is calculated as an average.  AVERAGE get it?  Also, engines have a break in period and there are very specific ways that MPG is tested, documented and submitted to Uncle Sam.  

If you think that you can have a vehicle weighing 2 tons, with shift on the fly 4WD (HI and Lo), with a 3.7L engine and get 50 MPG, let me know the name and number of your crack dealer.

If you need 50MPG, by all means, go buy a Honda or Toyota Hybrid.  You'll never get it in an SUV.

So with that, let me also state that you have to be able to get 300 miles to a tank on average no matter what vehicle you drive.  It is the golden number they all have to hit.  I owned a Neon (that one almost turned me off from ever buying another Daimler product, thank god they haven't messed with the Jeep line too much).  The tank was 12 gallons and I got 300 miles.  They either have to increase the MPG or increase the tank.  You won't find a consumer vehicle in any class that won't make at least 300 miles to a tank.

Okay, on to the interior of the Jeep.  Very nice, roomy enough for my 6'3" frame up front and still enough room in back for tall teenagers.  Great dash location on all the controls.  Interior lighting is good.  Closing any of the doors results in a good solid sound, including the liftgate on the rear.

The location of the window control seems to upset some reviewers.  I would much rather have them where they are instead on having them on a door handle and having the door handle press into my leg.

The location also works really well since I tend to drive with my left hand and lean my right elbow on the console.  On my '87 Fifth Avenue, I always had the center seat thingy pulled down and did the same thing.  With the controls where they are, I can hit them as needed, and they have the "auto down" feature which if you press the switch really hard, the windows will go down without you having to hold them down.

Another thing about the windows I like, the rear windows GO DOWN ALL THE WAY.  Not like in cars where because some idiot didn't buckle his kid in right, we can have windows that go down any more than 50%.  

The only weird thing is that the glove box seems awfully small compared to what it could be.  I don't know what is lurking behind there that prevented a larger glove box.  My unit did not have a lock on the glove box or center console.

The center console stowage is adequate but nothing spectacular.  You can however, still fit a fifth of Jack Daniels and a 357 under the driver's seat.  This comes in handy in the Detroit area where I live.  Lock and Load baby...

But seriously, there is nothing major that I found with the interior that was not acceptable.  Lets move on to the engine.

Looking at Consumer Reports, you can see the reliability is excellent for this engine and transmission platform.  Friends of mine that work at Daimler's HQ in engineering have confirmed this.

The engine is not crammed into the engine compartment, and if and when things break, all major systems seem to be easy to get at, if you are a do-it-yourself person when it comes to auto repairs.

I know I only have 1k on this beast, but I have no complalints about it being underpowered, I can leave rubber on asphalt and concrete.  The engine has a nice "throaty" sound. The suspension is tight and jeep like.  If you want a vehicle that has no road noise and a very quiet drivetrain, then this puppy ain't for you.  In fact if that is what you want, I suggest you either buy a mid seventies Cadillac, or put a briggs and stratton on a couch.  This thing rides and sounds like a Jeep should.

If you buy one and then whine about it, that tells me you either didn't test drive it properly or you didn't test drive it at all.

I can whip around corners better than other SUV's in the same class.  While this thing won't flip like the CJ5, it still does come down to a simple formula that is driven by the specific center of gravity.  You won't get handling from a sports car in this thing so don't buy it if you think you can.

My unit came with aluminum wheels (always prone to problems) and standard tires, these will both be gone very soon.  No serious off roading can be done with aluminum rims.  Don't attempt this, you'll end up with rim leaks in no time.

The only exterior complaint I have on my unit is that it doesn't have a handle on the rear liftgate glass, which on dry conditions ain't no thang, but when the glass is wet, your hand tends to slip off the unit when you try to slam it.
