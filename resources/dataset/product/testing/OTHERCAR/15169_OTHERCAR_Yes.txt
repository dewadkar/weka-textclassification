            I've had two other digital cameras in the past.
Both with lower resolution.{800x600)Both were inadequate for my needs.
I was skeptical to try another digital camera.
I decided on one last shot and bought the PDR-M60 online.
The first plus was the fact I saved $100.00 buying online.
It comes with a 4meg memory card that will only hold about 6 full quality
pictures.I suggest purchasing at least a 16meg card from the start.
The 16meg holds around 15 full pics.Also you should consider getting some
ni-cad rechargeable batteries.And although the instructions/literature doesn't tell you,I contacted Toshiba and they say the AC adaptor will recharge these batteries in the camera.
The picture quality is fantastic.I print on a Canon 6000 using photo paper
and my family and friends can't tell the pictures didn't come from the photo lab.
Once,the camera started acting funny.All my pictures were dark and the display was doing weird stuff.I went online and downloaded the flash upgrade and this took care of the problem.Other than this,I've not had any problems at all.
