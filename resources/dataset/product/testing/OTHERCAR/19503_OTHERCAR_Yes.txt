            I have been a film only user for years.  However, since the birth of my new daughter, I found myself taking lots of pictures and using up lots of film on shots that just didn't work.  I started considering a digital after a friend (and also new father) let me borrow his digital that he had been very happy with.  The convenience of being able to shoot 10-20 pictures in a sitting, keep the 2-3 that turned out good, and publish them to the web that day proved too much to resist.

I did a fair bit of research with a high empahsis on image quality.  Reading that the Casio carried the same lens as the Canon G1 was a real plus for me. I could not find if for sale at any local retailer to hold in my hand.

However, the real kicker was the price:  I picked up a refurbished model with the full one year warranty from Casio off of Ubid for $320.  They had been running lots of these for weeks, so I went for it.  I'm glad I did.  I have taken over 1000 images with it, mostly of my daughter and of family gathering, and I have been stunned at the image quality.  I have had prints made as large as 8x10 and they command attention.  I've recently put the high image resolution to another use: genealogy.  Since the birth of my daughter, I've taken a interest in genealogy to find out more about my family to pass on.  I've used the camera's macro mode to get close up "scans" of documents and the inside covers of some very old family bibles to give me a digital archive.  The images are clear and the writing is very readable in the pictures.

Transfering the images to the camera is the easiest thing in the world.  The software setup was a snap.  When I plug the camera into the USB cable, it shows up as a removeable hard drive with directories corresponding to the dates of capture and sequencially named files.  I just grab the directories in Explorer and move them to my hard drive.  It is a beautiful thing.

Now, the cons.  The camera comes with set of nonrechargeable alkaline batteries, of which no one has anything good to say.  I immediately paid $10 for a set of NiMH rechargelables and they have worked extremely well.  I keep the alkalines around as a backup in case I run out of charge, but I haven't needed them yet.

The other downer, which seems true of all digital cameras, in the memory card size.  16MB just flat stinks.  However, I was able to pickup a 128MB card for $77 at newegg.com (It's gone even lower since them, forget about microdrives with memory as cheap as it is).  The 128MB card holds 89 images at the least compressed highest resolution (about 1.2MB per image).  So far, I've not used more that 50 w/o unloading to the PC, but the flexibility of going for a long weekend w/o having to worry about running out of room can't be beat.

The main thing that I'll be looking for when it comes time to replace this will be better autofocusing.  The autofocus is very slow, although I can't really compare this to other digitals, only to my Canon Elan IIe 35mm camera.  Also, the autofocus fails at light levels I would expect it to work at - although this appears to be a failure of digital cameras in general.

However, at this price, It will serve me well for the next two-three years, by which time, I'll expect these other aspects of the camera operation to catch up to the image quality, which is superb at 3.3 megapixels.
