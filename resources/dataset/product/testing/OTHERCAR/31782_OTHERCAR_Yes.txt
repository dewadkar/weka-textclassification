            After years of using my Yashica F109 35mm SLR (with a manual focus) for occasions such as parties, weddings, etc., I was ready for an upgrade. I initially intended to buy a fully automatic 35mm film camera, as prices are very competitive these days. My hesitation with a digital camera purchase was my belief that the pictures would not be comparable in quality with that of a good film camera. However, after looking at photos taken by a friend with a Fuji 3mp camera, I was convinced that I could be happy with a digital camera and jumped on the 'net to do some research. (Actually, epinions.com was one of the first places I visited. And yes, the three reviews above did help me make my decision)
   After realizing the obvious benefits of owning a digital camera, I made a short list of the cameras I could afford (since I only wanted to spend about 300.00) and headed to Circuit City. I chose the D550 because of it's price, size, and features.
   The camera comes with the "standard" 16 mb card, but hey, all of the cameras I looked at had the same thing. (I purchased a 64mb card for another $35.00) After bringing the camera home and opening the package, I discovered the first of only three issues I have with this camera to date - the manual provided inside the box is very small, and does not include all the info you want or need. Yes, there is a more detailed manual on the CD, but who wants to boot up a computer just to read about spot metering? Anyhow, I read the manual and immediately began taking pictures. The menus on the lcd screen are not complicated, and easy to navigate. You can also post thumbnail-type pics on the screen (9 at a time) to view what you have so far on disk. For a person with their first digital camera, that was a pleasant suprise. I was really impressed with the picture quality, after using the "zoom in" feature to take a closer look at the picture as it was displayed on the lcd. I took several pics in different settings - low light, daytime outdoors, and interior with artificial light.
   The real test, however, was how the pics would look after being printed out. I hooked it up to my computer which runs on win 98, and it took with no problems. The CD included has a detailed manual, along with the Camedia 4.0 software. After installing the camera's driver, however, I discovered the second issue - there is no ac adaptor included with the camera, so you have to use the battery power to transfer your pictures to the computer. and it doesn't seem that the batteries last long when you're doing so much with the camera taking pics, previewing them, and then transfering to the pc (yes, the camera must be "on" for you to transfer the pics). What I ended up doing was buying a $15.00 PNY smartmedia card reader/writer, (USB) and installed that instead. Now, I just take the card out of the camera, and isert it into the reader. I save my camera's batteries, and the reader/writer requires no power supply. The pics transfer at a good rate, and my problem is solved.
   I then tested the software, which I must say I'm happy with. Now I'm no professional photographer, and you probably aren't either, so I'd say that most people are like me and would be more than happy with the software. It allows you to preview the pics, crop, resize, rotate, add text or clean-up the pics, and lets you not only print out the pics in different packages, but has templates for greeting cards, post cards, calenders, etc. Yeah, the templates aren't endless, but what do you want for $300.00, photoshop 7 from Adobe? The software is more than adequate. 
   I printed out several pics using my Cannon S600, which only prints at 1200 X 1200, and I must say I'm very impressed. I printed out one 5 x 7, a calender with a good size pic on it, and 9 wallet-size pics on a single sheet. All of the pictures came out great, and I have absolutely no complaints about their quality. The drag-and-drop ease of the software makes it a breeze to use.
  So, although I have to insert the CD to read the more detailed instructions, I'm happy with my purchase choice. You won't go wrong with this camera. I can't speak about shutter speeds yet, because I haven't tested this camera'a ability to shoot moving targets (Personally, that's not what I bought the camera for). So far, though, this camera has not failed to impress me. It's exactly what I needed, and I am now officially  part of the digital camera enthusiasts' club. My next obsession will probably be a 12 megapixel digital SLR - Wow, what will that be like.....
