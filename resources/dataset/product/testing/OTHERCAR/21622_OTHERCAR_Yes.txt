            The reason we purchased this vehicle was to gain moe passenger space.  Unfortunately it only truly seats 5.  I love the all time 4 wheel drive.  My husband has a Cherokee sport and I don't like having to switch to 4 wheel drive when needed.  

The vehicle is smooth driving, after getting use to the height of an SUV from a sports sedan, I find it quite enjoyable.  

For the last year I have had my Jeep in the shop with transmission problems.  First it was $600 then $2300 and now it is totally gone.  The transmission shop is suppose to fix it under warrantee but the annoyance has been tremendous.
