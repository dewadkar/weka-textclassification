            Well I'm not actually sure which model number it was that I used but regardless my criticism covers all of the Mavica line.  I worked with a mavica for about 3 months while in Africa taking photos for various websites.  Mostly wildlife with a little hotel,art, travel stuff too.

Anyway here are my chief complaints:

1) the view finder screen makes focusing manually IMPOSSIBLE given the terrible resolution of the screen

2) in the dark you are completely screwed unless you have some sort of large light with which to light your subject...yes there is a flash but its no good unless your image is focused and YES the autofocus has no idea what to do with a dark subject

3) the battery life is pathetic

The good thigs about the mavica are:

1) the screen as it allows interested african to actually see there pictures and you can delete instantly

2) the disc combatability...although I'm not quite sure why they don't go all out to the memmory stick as sony keeps saying they want to do

Overall I guess the newer mavica's are better but they still rely on bad focusing technology which inevitably limits the Mavica's usefulness to the point of saying thanks but no thanks.<br><br>
