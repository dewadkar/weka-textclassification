               <b>T</b>here really isn't anything too exciting about the 2001 Mercury sable, it comes standard with an anemic 3.0 153 horsepower OHV V6, But also is available with the semi smooth 3.0 DOHC Duratec power-plant. Despite the 2001 Mercury sable, re-introduced in 2000, being much more refined over its predecessor it still lacks the driving involvement associated with cars like the Accord V6.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

 <b>E</b>ven with the optional 3.0 DOHC Duratec V6 engine, <b>performance</b> is  just adequate. 0-60 times run  around 9 seconds according to many specs. These 0-60 times  puts the 2001 Sable in the same category as a 1990 Chevy Corsica powered by a 3.1 OHV V6 when it comes to acceleration. The base engine should not even be part of the Sable's engine line-up. The last time I checked (and excuse me for being cocky) the Mercury Sable was family car, a family car that was meant to carry up to 6 large people, groceries, and its own weight. I'm sure, at times, with this car fully loaded; passengers and groceries, this 153 bhp Vulcan V6 engine is moving around 4,500 lbs. Perhaps FOMOCO could take this into consideration in the future. The Duratec V6 doesn't do much of a better job performing this task, but it does it with much less fuss. The Sable tips the scales at almost (without any passengers) 3,500 Lbs. The 2001 Mercury Sable would be much better off with a slightly larger engine, that would offer more torque and horse power. Even a refined OHV 3.8 V6, like the one found in the Grand Prix GT would be welcomed.


<i>Interior Innovation:</i>

   The <b>Interior</b> of this car is relatively refined in all trims, cheap, yet soft leather, good ergonomics, plenty of amenities, and I mean plenty! Especially in upscale 'premium' models. It is no mystery why this car weighs so much, it's loaded to the brim with goodies in 'LS' trim. Electric antenna, Ac, premium 6 speaker sound system, and much more are standard on LS trim lines. The interior is much more useful than the 1996-1999 models, and the materials just seem much less plasticy that its predecessor's, screws are no longer visible in the plastic trim.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

           The <b>exterior</b> is very 'rental car looking', not as bad as a Ford Taurus of the same year, but there really isn't anything about this car that says 'class'. I would especially like to see some dramatic styling in a sport model, but apparently Ford wants to keep this car a safe sale, as the previous generation was a flop compared to the 1st and 2nd generation models due to its dramatic/ugly styling.

<i>Pricing:</i> 

 The <b>Price</b> is right. This car can be bought fully loaded for under 23,000 dollars. But beware! Holding its value is not one of Ford Taurus'/Sable's strong points
