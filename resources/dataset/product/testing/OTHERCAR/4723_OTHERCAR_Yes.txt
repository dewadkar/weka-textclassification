            Having studied photography and pursued my interests in the art quite seriously for many years now, as a traditional photographer I was very particular about taking my first step into the digital world. With so many brands and models of digital cameras available today, I decided look closely into what Canon had to offer, it being a name I trusted for both quality and performance.  

Keeping in mind that I wanted to be able to create large (8x10"-9.5/11") prints, I decided on a 4 Megapixel minimum, which would allow for high quality images of that size.  Since photography is only my hobby, not my profession, I was not willing to spend more that $400 on my digital camera.  This narrowed my options down quite a bit and I happily discovered the Canon PowerShot A80.  

The A80, I learned, was the upgrade to the hugely popular and successful A70.  The A80 offers the 4 Megapixel resolution I demanded, and much, much more.  The camera functions in a variety of modes that allow the photographer to sit back and snap images with ease in a fully automatic mode, or for those with a deeper interest in the craft, the camera can be switched to partial or fully manual modes, allowing the photographer complete control over his subjects.  The LCD flips out and rotates, for more shooting versatility.  This really is a nice feature that sets the A80 apart from all other cameras in its class.  The A80 comes with very easy-to-set-up software, including a fun and useful editing program, a USB cable for easy connection to your Mac or PC (or printer if it is direct-print compatible), the AA batteries needed to run your camera, and audio-video cables to very easily broadcast your photos or videos (that&#146s right, the A80 records up to 3 minute quality digital videos) on your TV.  Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of the A80, apart from its very reasonable $399 price tag, is the ease that it can be used&#133effectively and beautifully.  I am confident that the complete novice can master this camera quite easily, and the experienced photographer will be amazed at what this high-performance digital camera has to offer.  The A80 is quite simply the best I have seen.
