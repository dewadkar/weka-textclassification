            Let me start by saying I have owned the PDR-M70 for about 6 months and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  It combines all the features I was looking for in a digital camera and does so at a very competitive price.  When you take the camera home from the store you have everything you need to really use the camera.  No rechargeable batteries to buy, no A/C adapter, it�s all included.  I�ll touch on the specifics that stand out in a while, but it is a truly easy to use camera that also offers the flexibility a more serious photographer looks for.

Image quality is the first thing that comes to my mind and the overriding factor that led me to choose the PDR-M70.  It�s 3.3 Mega Pixel CCD renders outstanding images at it�s highest setting and does a great job at the lower resolutions as well.  My photos have been sharp and suitable for enlargement to 8x10 and beyond.  If you use the lower size/quality settings the photos are great for auction listing or inclusion in Emails & Web Pages.

The other area that I really liked was the ease of use.  The camera does a great job in it�s point and shoot modes and has won my wife over, who initially did not want a digital camera because she thought it would be too complex.  The full auto does have limitations in challenging situations, especially backlight scenes, but does as well of a job as can be expected.  If you kick in to the various manual modes you can anticipate the metering limitations and come away with some outstanding photographs in very tough situations.  It�s this blend of ease of use and manual control that I really like.  Snapshots are quick and easy or you can slow things down and do serious photography with the same camera.

I�m not sure why some of the other reviewers faulted the ergonomics on the camera, as I find them quite good.  The steel case feels strong and looks great.  The various controls are close at hand and I have found the function of the camera much quieter than other digitals and a whisper compared to my SLR.  You can take great candid shots without drawing attention to your self and the Indigo type backlight display is easy to read regardless of light conditions.  I might have liked a bit more viewfinder information as I am frequently moving between the LCD and the viewfinder, but consider this a minor fault.

The image editing software is another standout in my book.  Simply plugging the camera in to the USB cable launches the software and can automatically download the images.  They are cataloged by date and stored on your hard drive.  I also like the basic image editing software that is included.  It allows you to do most of the image manipulation you want without un-needed complexity and avoids the excessive hand holding, that can frustrate you after the first or second use, of some of the other image editors.  

Other handy features that I have not explored in depth are the audio and video recording capability.  Both could be handy in the right situation, but I find myself reaching for a real video camera if I want to shoot movies.  The camera stands on it�s own without these extras, so just consider them a bonus.

While I love the camera there are a few areas that could use improvement.  As mentioned by almost all the other reviewers, the lens cap is dismal.   I am amazed I have not lost it yet and constantly worry it will fall off and never be seen again.  Battery life is good while shooting through the viewfinder, but if you use the LCD a lot they go south in a hurry.  Toshiba made a tradeoff between camera size and battery capacity and the PDR-M70 uses a purpose made lithium rechargeable battery pack that can be difficult to find locally.  They can be ordered online, but cost around $50, pretty steep for something just larger than a single AA cell. 

Best of all, with some savvy shopping you can pick this little beauty up for a good bit less than other comparable 3 mega pixel cameras.  It�s this combination of features, quality, control and price that I think make the Toshiba PDR-M70 a standout.
