            The Plymouth Prowler exemplifies Chrysler's passion in recapturing the
once youthful exuberance of &quot;cruising and hotrodding down the strip&quot;.
Once inside this 1950's retro-rod, you're enveloped in all the amenities
of a fine luxury automobile; crafted leather seating, air conditioning,
power steering, cruise control, a computerized auto dimming rear view
mirror which displays compass heading, ambient temperature, instant fuel
economy, elapse time and total distance before refueling. Include these
with a 320 watt, 7 speaker, am/fm cassette, cd changer with automatic
speed sensitive volume control and you will have one well designed motorcar
that rivals anything in its class. This roadster comes with a soft top
that is conveniently hidden beneath the reverse opening trunk, its presence is only betrayed by the two latch receptacles on the rear deck lid itself. The indy-styled suspension and rear mounted transaxle for
even weight distribution makes the Prowler one smooth and precise handling automobile. The Prowler experience is one of joy and merriment
and with its 253 horsepower, 24 valve engine, this hotrod provides a
welcomed diversion from the humdrum and routine of daily driving. <br><br>
