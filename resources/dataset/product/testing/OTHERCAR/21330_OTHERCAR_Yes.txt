            WHY DID I BUY THIS CAR?

Why did I buy a Camry?  My job requires about 150km of driving daily
commuting between two different cities.  This car is PERFECT for chewing
up road miles!!  Just set the cruise control, pop in a nice CD and enjoy the ride.  This is definitely one of the quietest cars I've ever driven.

ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION

The V6 is a very nice engine, and perfectly suited to the automatic transmission.  Flooring the throttle gives more than enough acceleration to see off most everyday traffic, and the transmission will eagerly kick down two gears for overtaking situations.  Overtake a semi on a two lane highway and you'll be seeing 140km/h before it's time to get back into your lane.  Again, the engine and transmission combine very well with the quiet cabin to give a very relaxing driving experience.

HANDLING

Flooring the throttle coming out of a tight corner WILL spin the inside front wheel quite vigorously, resulting in understeer that will tug at the steering wheel.  But then what else do you expect?  

The suspension is set up more for ride comfort than all-out handling, which is fine for my situation.  The car will soak up most bumps on the road easily without you noticing them.

STYLING

A lot of magazine reviews I've read describe the car's styling as boring
and dull.  All I can say is that it looks a lot better than many other
cars on the road.  The Camry has very clean, almost sleek (for a passenger
car) lines.  

SUMMARY

If you want Mercedes ride quality at a Toyota price, this should be near the top of your list!  Extremely comfortable, nice performance, quiet and good value.<br><br>
