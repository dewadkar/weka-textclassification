            I am only 20 years old, but I know a tough truck when I see one, and the Chevrolet S-10 ZR2 is one of the toughest around. I have had three trucks in my short life so far, the first being a 1995 2WD 5-speed S-10. Great little truck, but there was something missing...POWER! The second truck that I had was a 1998 4WD S-10. Again, another great truck, but I still didnt have the courage to go hardcore off-roading. Then I purchased my 1999 Extended cab ZR2. This truck is like a tank!!! There isnt much that will stop this truck. This is the perfect truck for anyone who likes to go camping, hunting, or anything else that might take you deep into the woods. Even without having the truck in 4WD, it has plenty of power to spare. The features that Chevy has crammed into this medium-duty truck is unbelievable. The cab features plenty of leg room for both driver and passenger. With the ZR2 offroad package, you get every avalible option there is. Cruise, tilt, air, cd w/am/fm, and cassette, heated side mears, third door on the driver side, sliding rear windows, and plenty of ponies under the hood! With a 4.3L V-6 Vortec engine in this little of a truck, you will be able to keep up with those big boys in the Silverados.(almost!)<br><br>
