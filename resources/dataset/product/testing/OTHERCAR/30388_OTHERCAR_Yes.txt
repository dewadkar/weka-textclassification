            Another update. I just returned from a long trip with the newer TEK (see below). Between Kokomo IN and St. Paul, MN it got 30.1 miles/gallons on the the highway. After owning this car for 8 months I have no problems to report.

I wrote the review below about a year ago. Not much to add except to say that based on our excellent experience that we have bought another 01 Aztek. This one is all wheel drive and  fully loaded with heated leather seats etc. It had been sitting on the Dealer lot all summer and I was able to get it new for below the suggested retail used price. Its a great car.

Like most folks my first impression was that this car is ugly and wanted nothing to do with it. However, my wife liked it. So I did a little researching on the net and found that most owners were very happy with the vehicle. In addition, very few vehicles in the small suv or minivan class can tow 3500 pounds and still get decent gas mileage. This month the opportunity to obtain 0% financing for 60 months motivated us to take a look. It was dark when we arrived at the dealer and up close under the lights the car seemed less ugly. Getting into the car yielded a good impression. The seats sit up high and after years of driving a minivan; I don't like squatting down into a car seat. The dash is lit up with bright red lights and is quite impressive. All the dials and controls are easy to read and reach. The light switch has an automatic setting so you don't have to worry about turning on or off the headlights. The engine is very quiet. On our test drive the most noticeable feature was how quiet the car was, even at 65 miles an hour. Acceleration was not great, but more than adequate. It easily absorbed bumps and the steering was tight. So after a little negotiation (buying an unpopular car made this a breeze), we signed on the line. 
That next weekend we took the thing (I still don't know what to call it) on a 1300 trip. Along the way we encountered dense fog and found that fog lights were great. I was a little concerned about the back with the slanted glass. Turns that it has two positive features. In a heavy rain the airflow coming off the top blows the water off the glass. So even in a heavy rain, without a wiper, the view was still clear out the back. Second, there is a black bar that separates the two sections of glass in the back. At first I thought that this would obstruct the view. However, at night when a car follows too closely, the bar blocks the car's blinding headlights. I don't know if that was the intended affect, but it is nice. I should add that on the first day we spent 15 hours on the road. The car never missed a beat, didn't rattle, and the seats were as comfortable as seats can be for such a long period of sitting. 
We have had it for over a week and now I like the looks and appreciate the engineering that makes it different.
