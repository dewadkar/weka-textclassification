            I have owned a Honda Accord since 1989 and absolutely love it, so when my wife and I decided to buy a minivan it made sense to look at Honda first.  We also decided to check out the Toyota Sienna, but it had just come out and was prohibitively expensive.  We have had poor experiences with American cars, so we didn't even bother with Dodge, Ford, or Chevy.  So we went ahead and purchased a two year old Honda Odyssey LX.

One thing that immediately attracted us to the Odyssey was the fact that three children's seats could be placed side by side on the second row of seats.  Many of the other minivans only have two seats on the second row, so that the third child must sit in back.  We needed to be able to travel with all three children and have the back seat folded down for cargo, so the fact that all three children fit in the second row is a huge plus for us.

Another great thing about the Odyssey is the way that the third seat folds down.  By simply twisting two dials the seat folds quickly and smoothly into the floor, and reversing the process brings the seat back to the upright and locked position.  It is absolutely fantastic, and my wife loves the convenience.  No taking seats out and putting them back in!

The Odyssey is a little underpowered, so it is an experience pulling onto a highway.  The engine is very loud, which is distracting and tiring on long rides.  The transmission shifts smoothly, except during hard acceleration.  It handles well, not like a heavy, pokey minivan.  The seats are moderately comfortable, but I tend to be a little sore after driving for more than two hours.  The gauges and controls are well laid out, so everything is easy to get to.  Field of vision is good, although I wish they made the wiper bigger on the rear window.  Storage space behind the back seat is tight when the seat is up, unfortunately, and we only seem to be able to fit one double stroller and one or two small grocery bags.  The ceiling-mounted air conditioner does a great job cooling down the back seat passengers.

One disappointment with our Odyssey has been the brakes.  The van currently has approximately 38,000 miles on it, and it will be needing new brakes within the next 5,000 miles or so.  I expected to get much more that 43,000 miles out of the brakes.  This is one car repair expense that will really tick me off.

Overall my wife and I have been satisfied with our Odyssey and we hope to keep it for years to come.<br><br>
