            Review of 2000 Chevy Monte Carlo

Rental Car Adventures IV:  Baby Got Back
I don&#146t think the era of the large performance coupe is dead- at least not for Chevy.  I&#146m combining three experiences for this review.  The 2000 Monte Carlo is pretty much the same as the &#14602 and &#14603 models, all of which I&#146ve driven.  But I don&#146t feel like writing three separate reviews for them as I found very little differences.

<b>Background</b>
Cities driven in:  Houston, TX; San Jose, CA; Portland, OR; Seattle, WA
Each session was at least a week long, however the &#14602 model I ended up with a few times in the Portland and Seattle areas.

The Monte Carlo is a predictable car- I mean that in a good way.  When you travel for a living the last thing you really want are unpleasant surprises.  The car is a smooth riding vehicle that is for the most part a joy to step out of a plane and into.

As the owner of a 2002 Saturn Coupe, it&#146s odd to drive this car at times because for a two door, it is very large.  This is not your European or Japanese hold the road (for dear life) kind of car.  The cabin is spacious and inviting.  The car is easy to get in and out of without being overly &#145Buick-ish&#146 or anything like that.
And the trunk!  Baby GOT Back.  Lots of it.  In fact the &#14603 model looks a bit odd, in that the back end looks even bigger than the front.  I&#146m sure it&#146s nothing more than a bigger spoiler or something, but the visual impression is that this car has got quite a caboose.
The back seat&#133 well&#133 it is a two door- I personally think that coupes need to knock it off with back seats and just do the truck thing- put shelves or something back there to hold your luggage and laptop, etc.  Maybe a fridge or something, jeez.  But let&#146s say for the sake of argument that it&#146s more spacious than I&#146ve usually seen in Coupes.

The doors are heavy and large, however- it requires a bit of effort to lean out, grab the handle and pull the lumbering steel beast in.

Though spacious, and improved in later years slightly, the interior leaves much to be desired.  Very similar to the Olds Alero- boring and not as functional as one would hope.  A car that screams give me wrap-around bucket seating has flat couch-like seats.  While not uncomfortable, I was hoping for more.

<b>Performance</b>
This car has got more than size- it&#146s got a beefy V-6 (I tested both the 3.4 L standard and 3.6 L SS edition).  Well, beefy is a relative term.  It seems to me that this car was built for comfort more than performance.  Punching the accelerator is not the muscle car scream you&#146d expect, rather a front-wheel drive pull (on certain spaces I did feel the steering jolt a bit under hard acceleration).
Why Chevy went with front wheel drive (on the Impala as well!) I&#146m not exactly sure- but when it started to rain, I didn&#146t mind so much at all.
Handling is very good for a car of its weight.  Almost excellent considering the size of the beast.
Where this car really shines, though, is your typical cruising adventure.  This car would be a joy on long trips.  In fact the last &#14603 I rented I took on a trip between Seattle and Olympia and I was very impressed with the car&#146s longetivity.

The ride is nearly flawless with ample acceleration even at speed (probably why it was a Nascar pace car a few years ago), but the car is quiet at 130, er, 75 mph and the feeling is slightly deceptive as far as your perceived speed.  Bumps in the road are barely felt, thanks to the very solid construction and sheer bulk of the car.  This may be one of the most solid feeling cars I&#146ve ever driven- even more &#145solid&#146 feeling than the decked out Lincoln Towncar I transported from New Orleans to Houston (another story altogether!).  I never heard a peep out of the body:  no squeaks or the typical at-speed rumble usually heard with coupes I&#146ve driven before.

I&#146ve outlined in several of my reviews some of the standard GM interior features (speed-sensitive radio, dash layout, etc) and this car is pretty much cookie-cutter GM as far as that goes.

<b>Summary</b>
I&#146d say that this car is pretty nice all around if you are the kind of person that takes lots of road trips with 3 or less people in the car.  The cavernous trunk is built around said road trip with what I would deem as additional space for two people to lay in the trunk itself.  I am not kidding- this car has GOT BACK.
I would not recommend this car for the person who doesn&#146t enjoy trips to the gas station, or anyone with weak arms.
All around, however, I am willing to bet this is one of the last cars Chevy builds like this, so grab it while you can.
Now, if you&#146re one of those people who loves to customize a car- this car is for you!  Room to grow and the internal and external features scream for it.
Have fun!  I did!
