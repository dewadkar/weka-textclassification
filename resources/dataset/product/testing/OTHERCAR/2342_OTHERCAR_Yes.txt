                 When I started shopping for my first digital camera a few months ago I first looked at the traditional camera brands suck as Kodak and Fuji, until that is I stumbled upon this Toshiba model.  It fit my size requirements, surpassed my resolution requirements, had the Toshiba name I've grown to trust, and had an attractive price tag.  Without too many second thoughts, I clicked on the 'process order' button and had the camera sent UPS ground the next day.

     When I received it I began to take pictures of just about everything.  One of the greatest advantages of a digital camera over a film camera is that one is not afraid to waste film and experiment; and experiment I did.  After an hour or two of experimentation I had mastered all but a couple of its features.  At this point I finally gave in and consulted the instruction manual for assistance.  Also by this time I had already dropped the camera twice, but luckily the camera bears no marks of my early mishaps.  

     One of the significant reasons that I chose Toshiba over other brands is my experience with them as a company.  I have been using laptops made by them since their very first line of 386 portable computers, and in all that time they have always been very attentive to my needs as a customer.  For instance, my new refurbished Toshiba laptop mysteriously had hard disk problems, and Toshiba not only fixed it in 1 day, but they paid for all the overnight shipping required to complete the job.  This kind of service from any electronics company is astounding.

     After a time of use I was only a bit unhappy when I discovered that spare batteries for this camera are expensive indeed.  After seeing a price tag of $86, I gave up all hope of buying a spare battery or two with which to fill up a large SmartMedia card.  To counter this I have found turning off the LCD display increases battery life by a full 1/4 or so.

     After the fact, I am very happy with my purchase, and have already recommended it to a few friends.
