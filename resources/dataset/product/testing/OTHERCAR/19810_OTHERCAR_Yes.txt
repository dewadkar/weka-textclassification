            Mercury has not had to heavily advertise the new Cougar.  The first time I saw the new 2000 Cougar, I knew I had to drive it.  And once I drove it, the car sold itself.  Being a larger guy, I have had trouble being comfortable in good looking sports cars.  The interior was always lacking, very tight, and uncomfortable.   The front seats of the Cougar not only were inviting, they were comfortable, including plenty of headroom, even with the optional sunroof.   The engine is smooth and quiet ï¿½ providing plenty of V-6 power, with a barley audible hum.  The quietness inside the cockpit, makes you appreciate the quality sound system even more.  With the optional CD player and trunk loaded CD changer, you know you can enjoy a long trip with the music of your choice and not become weary of road noise.  
The handling is very good, with tight responsive steering.  Gauges are handy and easily understood.   Not only does the Cougar make you look good driving it, but you feel good when driving it.  While the rear seats are inadequate for adults, the kids or the dog are happy to ride along.  But when you need to haul something large, or lots of stuff, the spacious trunk, even in the 3-door coupe; is amazing. Open the hatchback, and you can easily reach the rear seat buttons to fold them both down, almost flat. Then load up a number of boxes, up to 68 inches long, as I recently did, and off you go, with the lid closed.  
Young at heart professionals and students, will enjoy the 2000 Cougar, its value, and roominess and quality.  Mercury needs to make better use of the space in the center console and provide an armrest, but even now, they definitely have a winner!
