            When the time came to replace our 93 Mercury Villager, we'd owned a minivan of some sort for over 10 years. We'd always admired the sexy sport-utes, but from a practical standpoint the minivan configuration always seemed to do a better job of meeting our needs. 

We need extra seating... not all the time but it has to be there if we want it. Most sport-utes have no more seating than your basic 4 door sedan.

We need interior volume and headroom. In a minivan, if you have to you can get out of your seat and get back to the kids with reasonable ease. In the average sport-ute you're going over the seat. A minivan is typically a little wider than a sport-ute, which again tends to be more car-like in its ergonomics, so they can seem a little cramped despite their high road stance.

Finally, we like the unibody construction of a minivan for a quiet, smoother ride than the ladder frame based sport-utes deliver. 

Now the 2001 Montero comes along. Completely redesigned, the new Montero is a unibody vehicle, with all of the inherent benefits. So, despite it's rather large size and high stance, it drives like a minivan. A damn big minivan, for sure, but certainly not a truck.

You can look at the picture and see that it's a hell of a lot sexier than a minivan, so I won't go on about the exterior styling, which is probably the freshest treatment of the sport-ute concept to date. Inside, you'll find a nice, wide interior with a nicely designed center console. Buckets up front and a 60/40 bench in the second row that folds and flips and does all kinds of things that you'll have to read the manual to understand. But the coupe de gras has to be the little 3rd seat set that pops up out of the floor in the cargo area, creating a total seating capacity of 7.

The XLS gets a cloth treatment that's comfortable and looks sporty and functional rather than downscale. The LTD gets the leather-and-wood makeover and is downright plushy.

Our Mitsu dealer had a choice of two (count'em) both XLS, both white with pewter cladding. Now they've got one. But if they had the LTD I'd probably have sprung for the extra 3k. Ours stickered for $31,800. We passed on the $1000 sunroof option and chose to have an aftermarket LCD video screen and VCR installed instead. (The sunroof and it's mechanicals takes away the prime screen mounting location above and between the front seats)

If you're dreading that next minivan purchase and would rather drop the money into something a little more fun, drag your wife down to the Mitsubishi store and drive the new full size Montero.

Yikes! get ready for a reality check at the insurance agent. This beast was double what the minivan was to insure. I didn't even think to check before I bought it. Also, the thing gulps gas. Otherwise, still a nice machine, just budget for the extra ownership expense.

We got to use that little 3rd seat. Little's the word. Two six year olds were cramped in there, and access is very awkward through the rear gate.

The &quot;check engine&quot; light came on because the gas cap wasn't fully secure (something to do with air flow). It was no big deal to reset, except the dealer would only do it by appointment and it took an hour.<br><br>
