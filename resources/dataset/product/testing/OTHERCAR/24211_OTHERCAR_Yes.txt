            I recently sold my 1991 Z28.  After all the hassle I have gone through to get another reasonably nice vehicle, it might have been a mistake.  Let's not get into that though...

Let's start with the good points of this car.  First of all, let me say that I had the nicest z28 in my city of 85,000 people.  Bright red, black racing stripes, loaded with air, and T-tops, but no leather.  It had a 5-spd, which is really the only way to go for a true sports car enthusiast.  The 91 and 92 unique ground effects and huge stock rear spoiler really helped make this car stand out.  It got looks everywhere - so if you want to impress the younger set, this is a great car to pick up.  In fact, I must say that it looks nicer than the rather generic 93+ Camaros I've seen.  Granted, you can fix those up to look really nice too, but they don't come as aggressive-looking stock.  Chrome trim and tint really adds to it as well.  Mine was lowered, which presented a few issues on speed bumps and large dips in the road.  The tranny tended to scrape, but the worst part was the stock air deflector in the front - it scraped on EVERYTHING, and made a horrible noise.  I suspect a non-lowered car wouldn't be nearly as bad, but it is still something to consider.  Performance-wise, the handling made you realize this is quite a heavy car.  It has better handling than most cars out there, but for a sports car it was somewhat dissapointing.  With this said, fishtailing is easy and preditable.  You can look like a pro (or a reckless idiot - however you want to look at it) with this car.  Straight-line performance was very good however.  I matched or outran many 5.0 Mustangs.  Don't let anyone tell you the Mustang is faster - it isn't.  With that said, upgrading the 'stang is easy - there are performance parts everywhere.  Not so for the Camaro.  Although, if you are interested, all you have to do to put in a custom ram air is to cut ducts in the plastic front, on either side of the Camaro emblem, then bring hoses (I used vaccuum hoses, but you want something with no ribs so it is smooth), to the dual airboxes.  Did it help?  I think a little... and it also made the car look more custom, and it didn't cost much of anything.  Where the air came in was more dirty than the rest of the air filter, so I presume it was working, even if I didn't feel too much of a power difference.  This car will outrun most anything on the road, except the newer cars, or expensive older sports cars like Corvettes.  The '93 had much more power (a full second off 0-60 times), and doesn't cost a lot more.  Having the air conditioning on does suck some of the power, but not as much as you'd think.  One really cool feature of the Camaros is the hatch, which gets electronically sealed when closed.  Considering this is anything but an airtight car, it seems hopelessly overengineered, but it sure makes you feel special.  I was impressed with all the little lights you can flip on around the interior.  There is a rotating ball-like maplight which directs light where you need it.  It's a nice feature.  The seats, contrary to what I have heard, seemed quite comfortable.  I wish they'd have some sort of side bolsters to keep you in though, when you're flipping around corners.

Now, the negatives.  Of course, it squeaked.  The t-tops especially.  You expect this from an American-made sports car.  It didn't seem too reliable, but I drove the car very hard.  At least the parts were exceptionally reasonable, until you have to buy the parts that make it a performance vehicle, such as exhaust, or tires.  Even with the nice ground effects and spoiler, the car is getting dated.  Hell, they kept this body style for 10 years - what do you expect!  The interior is hopelessly outdated.... they really should have done something with it mid-way through this generation's production run.  While you sit low, the boxy dash and other interior parts seem boring and run-of-the-mill.  The only sporty part is the high transmission area with the gearshift.  But, it's still better than the Mustang in my opinion.  There is a really interesting dial setup on the roof which is supposed to help you remember appointments, etc.  It is not electronic - only cheap mechanical plastic parts.  It's useless.  Rain has a nasty habit of running through the trough between the t-top and roofline, then coming into the interior.  Not fun.
This car is NOT good in the snow, as you might expect.  But living in BC, Canada, we get pretty bad winters.  If you have lots of weight in the back, and are a good driver, you CAN drive this in the snow.  It isn't the best, but it IS do-able.  Snow tires obviously help.  Gas milage is as you would expect from a V8 performance car.  Around town it can get pricy, but it actually gets quite reasonable milage on the highway.
