            <b>Introduction</b>
What do I know about this car? I know lots, since I almost bought one a week ago. I have never driven one, nor have I even ridden in one, but I hope you find this article to be very informative. I did do one heckuva a lot of research on it.

<b>History</b>
John DeLorean is the manufacturer of this extraordinary vehicle. This man worked for General Motors for a while, as well as designing many different cars, all put under his name. The DMC-12 was the only vehicle that was mass produces, with a grand total just under 9,000 cars over three years, most built in 1981.

This car retailed for a measly $30,000, a completely reconditioned one will cost you that price also.

Obviously this car was publicized best in the Back to the Future Trilogy. And, surprisingly enough, there are replica's of that exact car.(Sorry, the Flux Capacitor doesn't work)

<b>Things I have decided are pros</b>
The engine is made by Volvo. It�s a 2.85-liter V6, 174 Cubic Inches. It puts out a disappointing 130 horse power and 203 foot pounds of torque.(It closely resembles my Blazer's engine, which is 173 CI) But, for those of you who understand power to weight ratios, this car really gets up and goes. Zero to sixty is just over 8 seconds, at 8.1 tested by Motor Trend in 1981.  Other magazines tested it and found the 0-60 times to be closer to 10, ranging from 9.5 to 9.8. Keep in mind that you can get a Turbo for these, which will put you in the six second range for 0-60. I always thought it took Marty a while to get to 88, especially with that van full of people keeping up. Guess I wasn't that off.

This engine is extremely reliable, often breaking the 200,000 mile mark without major repairs. Parts are just as easy to get as a Honda Accord(according to the DeLorean Website), although a little(not a lot, not unreasonable) more expensive.

Gas mileage is different in everyone's eyes, some people see 24 as a good number, others see it as bad. I see it as good. This number is achieved with either the 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.

Ever hear of the Ford Pinto? The one that explodes when rearended? You'll never have that problem in a DeLorean. Using space age technologies it sports a Fuel Cell. This Cell will not rupture under any circumstances. Your car will never explode.  If you do get rearended though, start looking for a new engine.

Everyone of these cars came with leather interior. Many owners put seat covers on to protect their investment.

The styling has to be the best thing about this car. Some say it resembles a Nissan Sentra, I would have thought that too after seeing pictures, but an in person account proved otherwise. This car is beautiful, everything from the quad headlights, to the gull wing doors, to the louver�s, to the rims.

Mine main concern with the Gull Wing doors was the room needed to open them, a measly 14 inches will give you complete access to the outside world. My Blazer requires 22 inches to the first stop, and 40 inches to wide open. You could find the most compacted spaces in the parking lot and be alright.

Trunk(or is that hood) space is adequate at 14 cubic feet. This isn't excellent space, but plenty for a sporty car. Behind the driver and passenger is a ledge to place items on, fairly large. The storage in this car is lacking, but at least its there.

Four wheel Anti-Lock disc brakes are standard,(according to three different websites I've visited) way before their time. Stop this baby on a dime.

<b>Neutral</b>
This is not a fact, please don't take it as one. Since the engine is in the back, there is no feasible way to get the power steering to the front of the car. But, since the bulk of the weight is in the rear, you won't need power steering. I am fairly certain this car doesn't have power steering, but you won't need it. My front engine Blazer doesn't have it, and I have no worries.

I found that Louver�s on the rear window decrease visibility, this vehicle will be worse if not the same.

<b>Cons</b>
Where the heck am I supposed to put my drink? Cup-holders were not an option.

The Stainless steel body is all these cars came in, making fender benders expensive. You can paint these things, and many people have, but it kills the resale.

Resale is phenomenal. Great for owners, bad for me. Average price for a 17 year old car is 1/2 of original, at $15,000, often more, rarely less.

Everyone wants a DeLorean, including car thieves, an alarm and satellite tracking system isn't that bad of an idea.(On any car come to think of it)

Fueling would be hard, since you have to pop the hood. On all 1981 and a few 1982 models, you'll have an access panel, but it was discontinued because of cost.

This car was originally designed with airbags. Now how is that before its time, unfortunately they were never implemented because of the cost involved.

Top speed is limited to 124 miles per hour.  Thats fine, I don't like top speed, but for people that do, it will be a disappointment.

This car was built in Ireland. Because of a new U.S. law, the front end was raised, making for an awkward look. The law was repealed before it was even put in effect, leaving the front end of DeLorean's looking odd. For $550 you can lower the front end using factory specific parts. It should have come that way in my eyes.

The British government(who funded the project) destroyed many of the important di's required for making these cars.(I haven't discovered why yet)

<b>Overall</b>
This is quite the car. I will own one someday, just not right now, I can't afford it, its not feasible, I can't find one in my price range that isn't all custom(I don't want a custom collectors car).

If you can afford one(or find one for a reasonable price), you'll love it, its not quite the sports car is should be, but its still nice.

I've heard rumors that Mr. DeLorean is attempting to design a new car that will follow suit with the DMC-12.  I can't wait.

<b>My plea to you</b>
If you plan on customizing this car, please find one that someone has already painted, enough of these vehicles have lost that factory finish, which is impossible to bring back.

<b>Edited July 15</b>
I found one of these for a reasonable price($8,000), already painted white, in the area surrounding Phoenix.  I am going to go test drive next weekend, hopefully no one else see's the ad(it was kind of hidden).  I will edit this epinion accordingly after this drive.<br><br>
