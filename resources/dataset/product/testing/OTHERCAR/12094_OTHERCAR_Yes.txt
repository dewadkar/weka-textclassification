            I love my Suzuki Grand Vitara.  I went looking for just this type of car when I needed a new vehicle to commute 130 miles per day in Colorado weather.  I researched and found the Suzuki had the largest V6 engine in its class, plus the shift on the fly 4 wheel drive.  I drive an average of 75mph,4 days a week, 130 miles round trip and my Suzuki just eats up the miles.  I get an average of 24 mpg and the car is extremely quiet, with over 10,000 miles already on the odometer.

Some downsides, though...because it is a brand new model, we have had some growing pains as my mechanics at the dealership learn along with me.  I had some front end vibration and finally, Suzuki recommended new lower control arm inner bushings, just before my third complaint. I also had an annoying rattle in the headliner...mechanic found a support rod for the headliner had been hot-glued down and had worked loose.  He reattached the rods and the headliner and my car is quiet once again.  The dealership has gone out of its way to make sure we love our car.

All in all, I am very happy with this purchase...the Grand Vitara gets me where I need to be, safely.  I am high enough up to avoid headlight glare, I have plenty of storage room in the back, and it's a fun, little SUV to drive!<br><br>
