                 I was fortunate enough on my vacation to pass by the fairgrounds where Chrysler was hosting &quot;Chrysler Proving Grounds.&quot;  At this free event, you were able to not only see various Chrysler automobiles, but test drive the one of your choice on their custom built drive course.  Most of the people chose, of course, to drive the elusive PT Cruiser.  Many had already &quot;purchased&quot; their very own several months back &amp; had not driven, nor some seen the unique, exciting car.

     It was very interesting to see all the features in person.  The adjustable rear cargo hold, the more than comfortable seats, the innovative design...  Even the tall can easily &amp; comfortably be accommodated in the PT Cruiser; if you're 6'3&quot;, it's been proven you can fit with room to spare.  The interior is as unique as is the exterior.  For example, how many other cars have power window controls in the center of the car?  None I'm aware of.

     At the proving grounds, we were given an orientation before the test drives could begin.  Featured that day were the LHS &quot;luxury sedan,&quot; the 300M &quot;European touring sedan,&quot; and the &quot;too cool to categorize&quot; PT Cruiser, among other Chrysler models.  It was interesting to know that the manufacturer's are even unwilling to classify this car with traditional descriptions.  For those of you trying to figure out what to call it, there you have it: &quot;too cool to categorize.&quot;

     It has quick acceleration, ease over simulated potholes in the road, and superb stopping capability.  The only difficulty experienced was maneuvering around corners; it has a rather wide turn radius.  The seats with their lumbar support could make even long trips comfortable.

     What can I say?  The PT Cruiser deserves all the hype!<br><br>
