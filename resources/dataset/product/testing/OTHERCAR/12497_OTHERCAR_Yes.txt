After owning a Land Rover Discovery Series I for a few years my wife chose a mini van as her next vehicle.  It took her about a year of a Pontiac Montana together with the phrase &#147I really miss my Land Rover&#148 said EVERY day for the realization that she was in the wrong car to sink in.  Some people are meant to drive Land Rovers.

To say I was worried about my purchase is an understatement, an expensive &#145British&#146 car was one thing but after the problems I had experienced with the Series I, I was pretty much terrified of buying another &#145money pit&#146 of a car.  

Since BMW owned Land Rover when the Series II was built, a lot of things changed.  The electrics of the Series I were provided by Lucas, affectionately known in car circles as the &#145prince of darkness&#146.  I have personally experienced the reliability of Lucas electrical parts in a 1960 Austin Healey that lights the road when it feels like it only to have its mind changed by a Henry Winkler type thump on the hood.  The Series II utilizes Bosch electrical components, need I say more?

A different engine was employed and the car is something like 80%+ different from the I, so anything derogatory you have heard about Discovery&#146s probably refers to the I and not the II.

After testing a Dodge Durango, a Ford Explorer Sport, a GMC Jimmy and a Lexus RX300 we eventually ended up at the Land Rover dealership (our last stop).  We had a look at the cars they had available and narrowed our choice down to a &#145loaner' Discovery II or a brand new Freelander.

Both of these cars are impressive, the Freelander has a very different driving position but still bears many of the Land Rover off road traits &#150 those are good by the way.

At the time of writing Land Rovers come (new) in 3 models in the US: -
Freelander - starting around 25K
Discovery - starting around 35K
Range Rover - starting around 65K (don't quote me on this one though as I just tend to drool longingly at them until my wife drags me away - at least until they released the latest one)

Within the models they come in different trim levels, starting with SD then SE then HSE.

In the Discovery there is also a suffix of a 7 for the seven-seat version of the car.

I purchased the Discovery II because it's a little bigger than the Freelander, had a driving position I liked and because it had 4500 miles on it I could get a better deal.

The car is the SD model but has a leather upgrade.
It comes with 16 inch alloy wheels, dual AC (driver and passenger) and a CD ready stereo (but no CD changer).

The SE adds dual sunroof, cold climate package, fog lamps, leather, active cornering, 18 inch wheels and a CD changer to name but a few.

Then there are options over an above those like wood finishes on the dash, running boards, a host of entertainment features and more.

So we have now driven the car for about 10,000 miles here&#146s the review.


Land Rover dealerships love their cars and they want you to want one, if you aren&#146t one of those people that were meant to drive a Land Rover then that&#146s fine too.  They don't pressure you into a purchase, they work with you to determine if this is the right car for you and they do their best to get you a reasonable trade in on you car. As they tend not to resell outside their 'brief' our so mini van would be sold on to another dealer somewhere, in my case they got me more than I was expecting.


The Dealership
These guys are just great, there is no other way to describe them.  They are so 'into' Land Rover it's unreal, I was talking to the service guy and he said "so what did you trade in?"  I replied "a Pontiac Montana".  Seriously, his reply was "what's one of those?"  The whole place is just relaxed, relaxed, relaxed.  You drop off your car and they hand you the keys to another, usually the same model if they have one.  If they don't have a Land Rover they rent you a car.  Just bring it back with the same amount of gas in it.  I once dropped off the Series I to these guys for some work and when I picked it up 'another' intermittent problem reared it's head, they handed me the keys to a brand new SE Series II and told me to go skiing as planned and they would call me Monday.  Whenever I take my car in for any service work they valet it, and I need you to be clear here, they don't run a shammy over it and give it a quick vacuum, it comes back really, really clean, in fact it looks like a $100 - $150 valet job. 
Most people hate buying cars or at least the experience of it and I am one of those people, and the dealerships I've dealt with in the past don't want to know you once you've bought the car, call them up and remind them about a problem they agreed to fix and see what they say - that&#146s what I thought.  
In my dealership the guys know me by name, they know my wife and daughter, they even called me to remind me they 'owed' me something that was missing off the car when I bought it and that the item was in ready to be fitted.
They love to show off the cars capability so they build ramps and all manner of obstacles at the dealership to show you what the car will do.  Do not try this terrain in another vehicle &#150 wannabe Land Rovers should stick to the drive-through at McDonalds.

The feeling when you drive the car
For people who like to blend in and those who don't like to feel superior - buy something else - this is not the car for you.  There is something special about sitting in a Land Rover, you are part of the club, automatically accepted for your purchase decision.  Try nodding at another Explorer driver - they'll think you're nuts. 
Recently a Pathfinder driver was going to pull someone out of ditch when I offered to help, when he found out what I was driving he handed the rope to me, no questions.  On the same trip we were driving back from the mountains in 2ft of snow (on the highway), when the road closed behind us we were chosen by everyone as the lead car.  When you see what these cars are capable of off road you know that on the road this is the car to be in.
The car looks top heavy but it isn't, I recently went on a Land Rover arranged off road trip and you can put the car on a 30 to 35 degree angle (sideways) and although I was sweating it wasn't, it hung on no problem.  When you take the car into tough terrain or even tough conditions, it's only then you realize what they can do compared to other wannabe 4 X 4 vehicles.  When the Series II was &#145ready&#146 Land Rover took it for a test drive &#150 round the world over 18,000 miles through South America, Asia, Australia.

What don&#146t I like?
You can&#146t retrofit extra rear seats into one that didn&#146t have them to begin with (at least not that I&#146ve found).  Gas mileage isn&#146t great, the pockets in the rear compartment feel a bit plastic.  It only just fits in to my garage height-wise, so check that out (the dealership won&#146t have a problem letting you test this).  I can&#146t fit a roof mounted ski rack because of the height.  As they are still somewhat rare compared to other SUV&#146s out there, non Land Rover stuff/parts (like stereo cables &#150 try the Blitz Safe LROV/ALPDMX and the Apline CHMS620 changer for a Series II) that work with the car aren&#146t easy to come by.

Some People are meant to drive Land Rovers, some are not.  

Whichever bracket you fall into is fine.
