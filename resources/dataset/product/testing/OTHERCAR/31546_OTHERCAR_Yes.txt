            When working I drive a 1986 Volvo 240 GL.  I would tell you how many miles this car has driven, if the odometer worked.  When I bought the car it had long ago stopped moving at 168,000 miles.  From the years before I bought this car I can tell you that I put around 35,000 miles on a car each year, almost all of it in the city.  

The only major problem I have with this car is that the previous owner or owners put a few impossible to remove bumper stickers on the back.  Now I like the Rocky Horror Picture Show as much as the next guy, but I've never felt inclined to advertise that fact.  Too, Anarchy in the UK had their place in my life at one time, but not on my bumper.

The Volvo ride had often been described as a cross between the luxury feel of a Mercedes and the stiff responsiveness of the BMW.  I've driven a Mercedes for years and agree that the large, comfortable leather seats in this Volvo do resemble those in the S Class.  As to the BMW side, I've owned two 6 series (a 1978 gray market 633csi and a 1984 635csi) and have never found any other car as road responsive as they were.  Perhaps it does feel like one of the larger sedans, I just don't have the experience to say.

The safety of Volvo is legendary.  The durability of the 240 has taken on a near mythic level, a cult like following.  If you have a teen approaching driving age and are looking for a car without frightening amounts of power and unparalleled safety, the price and value offered by the Volvo 240 is hard to beat.  For around $2,000.00 - $3,000.00 you can have a car that should take them all the way past college and be reasonable to insure.
