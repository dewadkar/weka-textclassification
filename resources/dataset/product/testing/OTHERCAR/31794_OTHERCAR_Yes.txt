            I looked at several cars and test drove most of them before buying a 2000 Honda Civic EX Sedan.

The Hyundai Elantra was too noisy The Nissan Sentra was too cheap and the engine and transmission were weak. The Ford Focus was ok but I was not optimistic about the reliability or it keeping its value. The Toyota Corola was better then all the others.

Then I drove the Honda, the ride is superior to any sedan under $20,000 and the engine is smooth and economic. The whole package is very well refined and tight. Everything is well designed and placed. The controls are intuitive and where you would expect them to be. The radio is placed higher so that you can see it and reach it without taking your attention off of the road too long. The center stick shift does not get in the way of the radio or climate controls like on a lot of other cars. 

It has almost all the features I wanted that were extra on other cars. My wife and son love the sun roof. The remote keyless entry and power doors and windows are also nice. This is the first car I have had with all of these options but I am not worried about them breaking because this is a Honda.

The only things this car was lacking were the tail fin my wife wanted and the alloy wheels I wanted. But with the large market of third party parts for customizing Hondas these are things we can do ourselves later.

The one complaint I have is that the small 4 cylinder engine is lacking in the torque department. It has plenty of horsepower for highway driving and accelerates well but has problems on the hills. I recently drove from Denver to Vail, Colorado and had to keep if floored in third and fourth gear to keep my speed up steep hills. This was not a problem with my 1995 Plymouth Neon.
