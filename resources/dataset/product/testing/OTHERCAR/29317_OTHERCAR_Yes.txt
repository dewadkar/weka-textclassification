             We used to have a little Ford Festiva and after selling that, we wanted another dependable little car.  Living in Colorado, a 4WD can be beneficial.  I tried a Hyundai and a RAV (a friend's).  All were nice cars. The Hyundai was a bit weak, but was comparable to the Tracker.  The RAV was really nice and the engine decent, but it was worthless in the mountains.  Without the low gear option, it repeatedly had to back down or go around and find easier routes to traverse.  The Tracker came with the 2000, 127HP engine and it really runs decently if the engine is rev'd high enough.  I tried it at our property in Twin Lakes, CO and was able to drop it into low and go where I pointed it, unlike the RAV.  I believe dependability might favor the RAV due to it inability to go where the Tracker can go (much tougher terrain).  The RAV is much better suited for the streets.  Of course, that's where most people drive.  I'm 6'3&quot; and fit in the Tracker's front seats without much problem.  The seats aren't bad, but could be a bit wider.  My wife really likes the Tracker and we really consider it one of our best cars yet.  It seems like a very dependable vehicle and we saved thousands over RAV and have peace of mind with a car built in North America.  Other notable features:  Spare tire sits real low; great looking; able to easily open the overhead top and back portion takes about five minutes with practice. 4WD on the fly is convenient, and the price is great!<br><br>
