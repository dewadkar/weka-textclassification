            First off, I know precious little about photography.  If you're looking to read about specs and the nuances of digital photography, read the reviews from people who know what they're talking about.  All I know is that this camera is durable, easy to use and results in beautiful color prints.  So if you, like me, just want to pick up a little camera and be able to successfully operate it, then the Powershot S230 is probably a wise choice.

The size is perfect.  Small enough to fit into a purse or pant pocket, I've hauled this camera across country and barely known it's there.  The battery life is decent.  With pretty regular use I seldom need to recharge it.  When it does need juicing up, the charge doesn't take but an hour or so.  Without using the manual I was able to figure out the general controls, battery port location and remove/replace the memory card.  So this may be a bad sign for someone who is looking for a camera loaded with features.  It does have an 'outdoor' setting and red-eye reduction, among other features, but basically I just turn it on, point and shoot.  There is a small button on the back of the camera to select 'movie' mode, the playback screen or adjust the setting to take regular pictures.  I rarely use the movie mode, as I'd prefer to use my old time-y video movie camera for that sort of thing, but it I have used it and the picture is decent.  I had a hard time adjusting to using it for the movie setting, as the camera is so tiny and it just felt strange for me to film that way after being used to lugging around a five pound VHS home movie camera. I prefer using it as a straight digital camera.  It is very simple to erase a picture you don't want, even though you won't be erasing much as just about every photo captured is worth saving.  

When I grow more confident with my skill, I plan to pursue the other settings this camera has to offer.  I do know that in the hands of a person FAR from being an expert, I was able to capture the moment and not miss a shot.  On a recent trip to the Oregon coast, I was tickled pink to see that the Canon perfectly captured the turquoise of the water without missing a beat.  Little old me was actually able to take those 'postcard' shots and have some bragging rights when I got home.  

Removing the memory card is super simple and it's a one step process to attach to my Mac.  Downloading was a snap and I didn't have to buy any extra software to view the photos on my desktop.

I realize this review isn't too helpful to people looking for thorough information, but if you just want to start with an affordable, yet quality camera I can't see the Canon letting you down.  In the hands of this idiot it did just what it SHOULD do.  It worked.  Beautifully.
