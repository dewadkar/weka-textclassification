            I had never even really researched digital cameras to purchase, when this one kind of fell into my lap. A cousin of mine sold it to me used for $80 US, as he had recently purchased a much more expensive one. I didn't know what to expect from this little camera! I was a bit disappointed that it had no zoom lens, but soon discovered that I would grow to love this camera! We just recently became parents, and have used this camera to document our daughter's life, and, more importantly, to share pictures of her with friends and family from afar. It really does take nice pictures, especially for our use of it. Our only complaint was that it uses batteries like crazy! We soon fixed this problem by buying rechargeables, and turning off the preview screen. I recommend this one to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced digital camera to use just for 'fun!'
