                  On May 5th, Fuji released it's newest consumer camera to the public, the FinePix 4700.  Critics marveled at it's 4.3 Megapixel resolution, new 3x optical lens, and the improved 80 second avi movie feature.  So when I saw the 4700 on display last weekend I couldn't resist the opportunity to check it out.  First, Let's take a look at the specifications:

<b> The features on the Fuji FinePix 4700 </b>

* 2.3 megapixel resolution with up to 4.3 megapixel from a fixed file
* 3x Optical and 3.7 Digitial lenses
* up to 80 seconds of movietime with audio
* Rapid frame shooting up to 3 shots a second
* 5 option modes: auto, portrait, scenic, night scene, and full manual
* 3 settings: 640 x 480, 1280 x 960, 2400 x 1800
* ISO settings of 200/400/800
* 16 MB meter card
* Nickel Hydrate batteries

    Now let's break this down some and explain what that's going to mean for you as a consumer.

    1.  The resolution:  Fuji markets this camera as having 4.3 megapixels of resolution. It doesn't.  Rather, certain stillframe shots overlap the resolution, thus creating the effect of 4.3 megapixels in certain situations.  Everyday shots normally take place at 2.3 megapixels. Still 2.3 megapixels will take beautiful, crisps photos.  8 x 11 shots come out looking good and it will meet all of your photo needs online.  True, their are certain point and click cameras that can take sharper photos but for the average consumer you won't be able to tell the difference.

    2.  The lenses: Fuji Finepix 4700 boasts both a high-quality digital and optical lens.  What that means is it's recognizing the fact that this will become your do all camera.  The Finepix takes wonderful pictures either indoors or out.  The three independent ISO settings allow you to manipulate the lighting to compensate for the outside.  The camera does struggle a bit in extreme low light, but most cameras do.

      If your an inexperienced photographer this camera will put your mind at ease.  The digital zoom does the work for you.  Buttons are clear and easy to navigate.  If your not happy with your results, clear out the photo and try again.  And with the Adobe Photoshop Deluxe software your prints come out looking masterful and ready for display.  

     3. The Movie features:  Here's one of the things that I really like about this camera, the ability to film up to 80 seconds of quicktime movies with sound.  Imagine being on vacation and then being able to film a real-time commentary of the Grand Canyon.  Then you save it, download it, and mail the video to 30 of your friends.  This camera makes this a reality.  Want to document a vacation? Now you can.  How bout creating an online interactive photo album?  The possibilities are really endless.

     4.  Extras and pertinent info:  One plus about the FinePix 4700 is that it comes with a 16mb storage cartridge.  The comparable Olympus models only offer 8mb cards with their cameras.  As you become more experienced with digital photography storage space will become very important.  With the FinePix 4700 you might only end up having to purchase and extra 16mb cartridge instead of a 32 mb card you would likely purchase with other models.  That's probably a savings of $60 dollars.  

     Your also going to have to purchase an adaptor for this camera and some extra rechargable batteries.  These batteries will drain power like you won't believe.  Better to have a second set recharging than to be out and about with no extra batteries.

     Finally, don't forget to buy yourself a Scandisk reader.  The USB port that comes with the camera is still too slow.  Spend the money on the reader and you won't waste an hour emptying out your camera.  Many retailers will be willing to cut you a break if you purchase your accessories in bulk.  Be smart about it and buy them at once.  Your going to need them.  

     Overall, this is a very impressive camera.  For $799 dollars your getting a 2.3 megapixel camera that's lightweight, has an optical and digital lens, quicktime movies with audio, and a reputable manufacturer in Fuji.  If your thinking of going digital than this is a camera you'll want to explore<br><br>
