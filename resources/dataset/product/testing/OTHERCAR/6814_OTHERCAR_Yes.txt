                    I purchased a 1998 mercury sable fully loaded for only 24,000 after tax.  I have just about all the options except a Cd player.  I have to honest and tell you  i have had no major problems with my car so far after 2 years almost.  The leather look great the sunroof was a great extra too.  I am very pleased with the engine it has a lot of power and has good pick up speed.  The brakes work like a charm, and stop on the button.  The only thing  i can say i do not like about the car is that the windshield wipers are not the best and neither in the rear defroster.  The wipers do no clear the window for the best possibility.  The defroster takes a little to long before you see it start to work.  Overall, i am very please with my mercury and definitely plan on buying another one in the future.    <br><br>
