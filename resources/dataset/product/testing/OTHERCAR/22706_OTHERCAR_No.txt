            When I bought my '95 Neon, I was very excited, it was my first new car.  Unfortunately, though, I don't think that they had worked all of the problems out of this car before they put it on the market.  In my first year of ownership, I had the car in twice for the air conditioner; it kept quitting.  In my second year of ownership, I had it in three times for the air conditioner and had to have my &quot;stainless&quot; steel muffler replaced because it rusted completely out.  In my third year of ownership, two more times for the air conditioner.  Finally, this past summer, I took the car to a non-dealership mechanic and found out the real problem with the air conditioner.  It has bad wiring and therefore leaks.  The cost to repair: $650.00.  Needless to say, no more air for me. In addition, over the past year, my windows have began to leak.  After a good rain, my back floors were soaking wet, leaving a wonderful smell of mildew throughout the car.  Currently, the car is in the shop for the fourth time for the &quot;check engine&quot; coming on.  The mechanic believes that I have a bad O2 sensor.  Although, he told me that the sensor was tripped 262 starts ago, but, my &quot;check engine&quot; just came on two days ago.  Hopefully, nothing serious ever happens if it is going to take 262 starts for me to find out about it.  If I was financially able, I would definitely sell my Neon and buy a different vehicle.<br><br>
