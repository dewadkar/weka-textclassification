            It took me over 6 months to shop for a new car.  About three months ago I literally fell in love with the Saturn SL1.  I did not want to purchase the vehicle until 4/2000, but as with life things happen that change  plans.  Last week our second car broke down and I was faced with the need to buy the car early.  I was very nervous that the sales department would use this situation to, &quot;Pull the wool over my eyes&quot;  This was far from the case.  I asked the sales manager to give me 300 for my old tired vehicle.  He agreed without a hassle, which is amazing because the vehicle was not worth it.  I also explained that I was rather nervous because I wanted to buy the car in April, as I did not want overlapping car payment, one at a time is enough for this house.  He said that he would see what he could do. (The payments are on our primary car, not the trade in)
The next day he called with a loan from an excellent bank in our area.  The loan included a 300 deposit as promised, and Saturn cut me a check for 180 to cover the overlapping month on the other car!!! (May I add that I got one of the best interest rates available....not one of those &quot;Through the Dealer sham deals at 5% above the going rate)
Now being of very suspicious mind I compared the paperwork with the figures from a few months back and they all added up....I did not find the 480 tacked onto the loan.  
I think that my treatment by Saturn was outstanding, and I may add that I have gotten comments EVERYWHERE I go about my beautiful car, and I have shared my experience over and over.
It was exciting to hear a knock on the front door, and upon answering it say, &quot; UH, did anyone order a Saturn?&quot;<br><br>
