            I'd been looking for a digital camera for months when I came across an ad in the paper for the Panasonic PV-SD4090 PalmCam. I got it at Frys Electronics for only $300 (retail price $999!), and I've been really satisfied at its performance.

The best thing about this camera is its storing capacities.  It utilizes 3.5 inch floppies (1.44 MB), but those only store about 10 superfine (1200x960 pixel) pictures.  But with the superdisk that comes with it is also 3.5 inch, but stores 120 MEGS!!! that's 500 superfine pictures, 1000 fine pictures (800x600) or 1500 normal pictures (640x480)!!!  The camera itself acts as a superdisk drive (the superdisk won't function in your floppy drive, although you can buy a superdisk drive to install into your computer), and you can easily trasfer files from the camera onto your PC or Mac.

The camera also features a 2.5 inch LCD picture viewer and viewfinder in the back, so it's easy to capture pictures.  The camera itself is much larger than traditional digital cameras, but that's because of its extra features.  What extra features? Why, video recording for up to 10 seconds(in quicktime format, including sound), and an option of including a 5-second sound clip with each photo.

The only problem with this camera is that the frame is easily scratched.  I heard the lcd is easily scratched too, but i've been careful with that so as of now it's still fine.  The only thing this camera needs is a case; it comes in a box and so you'll have to wear it aronud your neck or something.

Another problem exists in no the camera, but the battery. Each one only lasts about 100 shots (although they say 200), and the camera can't be left on very long, so if you're away from an outlet or charger, be frugal with camera use.  The camera only untilizes i think 2 batteries, both made by Panasonic for this camera and other of their electronics.  The batteries are from 90-100 dollars each, so they're quite expensive.

Besides that, this is a great camera, with features like no other.  I wouldn't buy it at it's suggested $1000...i paid $300 but would go for it as long as it's under $600.<br><br>
