            My family has owned our 2dr, 2wd Blazer since 1994.  Options on our truck include the 4.3 "Vortec" engine, All digital dash and a "tahoe" interior appointment group and the usual power features.  The exterior styling is very squared off on the corners so people who like traditional cars will not be disappointed.  The dash is so entertaining, the turn signals get progessivly bigger rather then just blink, you might forget to drive!  This Blazer was purchased to serve as a family car/truck to handle the day to day needs and hauler for our weekend cabin.  Over the years it has served quite well.

As I am writing this the truck has over 90,000 miles on it and still drives like the day we bought it.  First let me point out that being a two door model some of the other opinions on S-10 Blazers need to be clarified.  The ride of our Blazer is quite bouncy over poor roads and some some interior room is sacrificed.  Both of these can be directly tied to the shortend wheel-base as compared to the 4-door version.  Also note that the two door only seats four people including the driver while the 4 door can seat five.  I also wish the rear seat had a split-folding feature but it is very easy to fold flat with just the release of one lever.  The Blazer gives a good if not BMW like handling and it has helped move my friends from both houses and apartments.  A medium love seat can fit in the cargo area with the rear hatch closed.  The car itself fits into just about any parking space imaginable.  You know those "compact only" spaces in the garage at work??? No problem, this thing can turn on a dime.   

You might be saying: It's a chevy, and was originally designed in the early eighties, just how many parts have fallen off????  Well if you let me ignore the fact I can't keep hub covers on the aluminum wheels, not much. Sure we have gone through a  alternator, A/C system and fuel injector unit but nothing else major that I don't consider normal wear items for a eight year old truck.  I will also give some credit to skilled mechanics. I pulled in a few times expecting the worse and then getting it fixed for under $100.00.  A honest mechanic is worth his or her weight in gold!

I do need to devote a paragraph on brakes.  Overall the brakes have what is best described as a "mushy feel" from the pedal, and is harder to press than some other cars.  This takes some getting used to.  Second, the ABS system on this model of truck has its share problems. Stopping distances can be quite long once the ABS system engages.  this can be credited to the rather rudementary operation of the ABS system compared to newer models.  Often the ABS computer itself needs to be replaced.  The part cost alone is over $800.00  General motors has issued a "Service Campain" for this model Blazer where they will replace part of the ABS computer for free.  I don't know if this makes or Blazer more responsive but it does seem to shorten stopping distances while using ABS.  

The Blazer still looks great; paint and interior are free of fading  and other wear.  Four adults do fit comfortably and the front seat adjustable lumber support makes the seat very comfortable for longer drives.  Taller drivers may wish for more rearward front seat travel.  One problem that has surfaced is the engine putting out a puff of smoke when you start in the morning.  I am told not to worry as this is a common problem for this engine and that I can drive another 50,000 miles before needing a valve job.  Note that my last Company S-10 blazer of the same model year had over 200,000 miles on it.  Another concern is the transmission sticking in first gear after long periods of idleing in park,the Co. Blazer did this too.  Anyone know what this is about????  I do feel confident in the overall realiability of the Blazer to sell it to a friend. 

UPDATE

Well another year has passed and the Blazer has over 107,000 miles on it now.  A new set of tires rolled it over the 100,000 mile mark.  Since last report I have had another alternator put on along with a new water pump, brake master cylinder and heater coil.  (all separate repairs)  Two items I have not taken care of yet are a power window that grinds and a stuck tailgate latch.  Both of these can be credited to my living in a very tropical climate with lots of moisture which helps rust and other deterioration.  The other repairs were thankfully relatively inexpensive ranging from $120.00 to $190.00.  still not too bad for a nearly ten year old truck.  

When shopping for this vehicle check the service history of the fuel injector unit (they tend to only last about 75,000 miles) and ABS/Brake system.  If the car is hard to start or Brake/ABS dash lights are on this could be signs of expensive repairs!  Lastly do a hard stop too see how the ABS system works and see if it is acceptable.
