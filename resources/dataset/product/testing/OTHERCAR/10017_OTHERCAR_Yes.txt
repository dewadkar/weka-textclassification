            After recently finding out that we were to be stationed overseas my husband and I decided it was time to buy a new car.  In the five years we've be married we have owned a 1949 Jeep Willy's, a 1992 Geo Storm and a 1993 Chevy Mark III Van. All three are wonderful vehicles but of course after 2 kids the jeep and Storm were to small to go anywhere and the van was to large for German roadways and not enough power. 

 So car shopping began for a smaller car that was not only had power but was safe as well.  After going through many web sites dealing with autos we finally decided on a 2000 model Kia Sephia that was not only in our price range but was rated as one of the safest cars on the roadway.  Not only is it comfortable with plenty of leg room and dual airbags. It has a very spacious trunk, child door locks and child saftey seat anchors which was a major selling point for my husband and I.  The Sephia engine is 125-hp with 1.8 liter has the power to go where you need to go.  <br><br>
