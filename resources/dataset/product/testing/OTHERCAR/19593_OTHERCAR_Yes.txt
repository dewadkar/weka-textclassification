            <b>Update 2/2002</b>:

In the last couple of weeks I have had to have the passenger side seatbelt completely replaced.  Additionally, I had to have my car towed twice due to what seemed to be the wheel locking, but it turned out it was due to a defective ignition, which apparently is prevalent in the later model Saturns.

Most upsetting is that my car is now apparently no longer under warranty because I was misled when I purchased the car.   I was told when I last took it in that the warranties on Saturns go from the time the car is first inspected, not from the day of purchase.  I definitely was not told that when I purchased the car.

I still enjoy my car, but will think long and hard before buying another one.  I am fighting for reimbursement of the $60.00 I had to pay for the ignition, and fighting to get some more time on the warranty, as they were not open with me.

<b>Update 8/2002</b>:

Okay, things are better now.  I was reimbursed the $60.00 after writing a letter, and requesting it.  They also determined that my warranty will be covered for the full three years, as I was not advised of the policy.  I am considering getting a newer Saturn now, because even though a couple of little things have gone awry the good still outweighs the bad.

<b>Reason For Purchasing A Saturn</b>:
 
I was drawn to the <b>Saturn</b> dealership when I needed a new car, as I was frustrated with other dealerships (left a Honda dealership in tears, and I was tired of Toyota's aggressive, shark-like salespeople). It was just as they advertised. The salesman was warm, nice and relaxed, and I went in there with the attitude of I'll bite the bullet now if I can make a deal (even though they say they don't deal) and if not, I'll come back in a few months, just before my registration expires. 

While they say they don't deal, and for the most part they don't, you <b>CAN</b> deal as far as your <b>trade-in vehicle</b>. I was fortunate additionally because I was able to purchase what they call a "buy-back".  Perhaps you are familiar with that term, but I was not. What had happened is that it is so important to <b>Saturn</b> that the customers are kept happy, that when a buyer decided after 1300 miles that he didn't like the color of his <b>Saturn SC2</b>, (a dark blue) they took it back, and gave him the car in another color. That worked great for me. Blue is my favorite color, and while it shows dirt easily, hey I'm not complaining. They reduced the price by a couple of thousand dollars, and I got a fully loaded car. They were happy to get the car off the lot as it wasn't totally new (had the 1300 miles), and they were bringing in the <b>Saturn SC2</b> three door models. 

I bought the <b>SC2</b> fully loaded, including the lumbar support for comfort on long or short treks. The driver's lumbar support seat is wonderful for the support of the back, as it adheres perfectly. However, the <b>width</b> of the seats is too narrow.  If I allow myself to gain weight, the width of the seats would absolutely not be appropriate.

I do wish they provided the lumbar support for the passenger side also. The car is so comfy, I can drive for hours. . . except that the width of the seat takes away from that a little bit.  I love the sporty look of the car (minus the high insurance costs for sport cars). I love the way it drives, it has plenty of pick up and go.

Is <b>Saturn</b> as indestructible as they profess: 

At my place of employment, we have a huge underground parking lot for employees and patients, as well as members of a gym which is located next door. Frequently, these huge SUV's who mistakenly think they are Miatas, park in the compact spaces next to me. If I am over the line a little because of the SUV, the person on the other side will get mad, and key my car. The first time it happened I was so upset, but was very happy to find out it just rubbed off. This happened also when someone lightly backed into me, I rubbed away 98 per cent of the damage because of the way they make the <b>Saturns</b>. The customer service has been wonderful as advertised. 

<b>Pros</b>: 

I loved the <b>Saturn SC2</b> initially. I appreciate the remote keyless entry, and they gave me extra keys, in case I misplace a key or two. It has a smooth ride, accelerates well and quickly, and takes corners well. The gas mileage is very good; the lumbar support on the driver's seat is terrific but the seat is very <b>narrow</b> and the height of the car is not sufficient for taller people. There is ample room in the front; limited in the back. The insurance costs are very low due to the way the car is made. It can be repaired relatively inexpensively. 

<b>Cons</b>: 

This car is not meant for taller/broader people. I am only 5'3", average weight, so the height of the car and seating doesn't present a problem for me, though the narrow width is irritating over time. As far as the back seat, it is only good for children (smaller children).  The problems with the car are minimal but irritating, and I don't think should be occurring with a relatively new car.

<b>Saturn service:</b> 

Their prices for regular servicing are extremely reasonable unlike my previous experiences with dealers like Toyota. I was very dismayed to find several dings in my much loved car. When I brought it to <b>Saturn's</b> attention during a regular tune-up/servicing, they spent an hour smoothing it out, and painting necessary places, and now my car looks beautiful once again. I asked them what I owed them, and they said it was part of the service. 

<b>Problems:</b> 

A few months ago I was unable to open the driver's side window. I took it in and they immediately replaced it without any question at all. I was happy about that, but didn't think it should have been a problem to start with. 

Additionally, the a/c is somewhat weak. I brought it to 
their attention. They said they checked it, and it was 
fine. Well, maybe fine for them. . . not for me. I don't 
do well in hot weather. 

<b>Conclusions:</b> 

I really enjoy my <b>Saturn SC2</b>. Dealing with the sales people is a piece of cake, even for a woman alone. They won't take advantage of you. At least, that was my experience. It looks sharp and sporty, drives smoothly and safely. The gas mileage is very good particularly on the freeways here in Los Angeles. It is well made for the most part, and it takes a lot to ding it, and cause it to dent. 

The stereo sounds fantastic, and has theft deterrent. The service is excellent, repairing little problems if they occur, providing shuttle service, washing my car after servicing. 

The main glitches are the windows, the fact that the height of the car and width of the seats is made for smaller people, and the air conditioning could certainly be stronger and more effective. 

There are pros and cons to this vehicle, but for the looks, ride, price of car, and phenomenal service I am willing to accept the small problems. I am giving it a 3 1/2, rounding it up to a 4, out of a possible 5. I enjoy my car, but I'm a little concerned when my warranty runs out in a month or so. I've never had any of these problems in new Toyotas or Fords.


Thanks for reading.
