            My first child was on the way and I had to give up my 86 Pontiac Fiero, for something our (soon to be 3) family could fit into.
MY body, MY car, would the humility EVER end?   LOL
Being that I wasn't interested in a family type car I can't tell you how surprised I was to have found myself in love with the brand new 1990 Accord Ex we bought the year my daughter was born.
It handled like a small car and while I didn't have the horsepower I was used to, it did have what Honda calls a *sport feature that gave the car a little more oooompfh when you engaged that feature on it's gearshift.
I loved the *classic body style that reminded me of the BMW cars.   The gas mileage was great and we used the fold down back seat feature to extend the trunk space quite frequently to carry all the things new homeowners seem to need.
Long road trips weren't the most comfortable, as both my husband and I are tall, and it seems that Honda's seats fall short of where they need to be,for comfort.   The driver's seat had lumbar support and more adjustability than the passenger side.
In the 9 years we owned it, there were no major repairs.  The stereo conked out shortly after the warranty expired but the dealer took care of it at no charge! We added freon to the AC for two summers before the leak was located, but other than that it wasn't in the shop for anything but an oil change and tuneup.  Lastly, two years after driving the luxury foreign car of my husband's dreams, I STILL miss my ACCORD!  It's the perfect compromise between sporty and family at a price that doesn't cause sticker shock :)   
Haven't liked any of the recent Accord body styles enough to consider a newer Accord, but hope that will change someday.
Can't say enough about the car OR the company.
Honda does things right!<br><br>
