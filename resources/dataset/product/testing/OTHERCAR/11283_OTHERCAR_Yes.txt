            Looking for a replacement for a reliable car is sooo hard to do.  I went to my Saturn dealership - yawn.  I went to my Chevy dealership - groan.  I went to my Ford dealership and begged them to show me something I'd like - they failed.  I went to my VW dealership - Yikes! that much for THAT!?!  

So there I was, standing in the Don Miller Pontiac dealership after dropping off my boss to get his Grand Am back from repairs.  Nothing tripped my trigger.  I glanced over to the other Don Miller next door (Gasp! me? A sworn devotee to buying everything American (or German) looking at Japanese autos?  It can't be!) and spotted a Midnight Blue Mica Protege5.  Well, They're 20% or so owned by Ford so, what the hey....

I purchased my Mazda Protege5 on May 31st, 2002.  It came with only floor mats and moonroof as options.  Of course, Protege5's are loaded with standard features - Power locks & windows; Air Conditioning; Dual airbags; 4 wheel disc brakes; remote keyless entry; etc; etc. 

I was stepping up from a '95 Ford Escort Wagon.  I kinda thought I was buying my old car in new clothes.  After driving the Protege for a couple weeks, I had to drive the "Superscort" to it's new owners house.  Wow what a difference!  The ole Ford felt gutless after a week in the Mazda.  

The first day I brought it to work, a lot of people laughed at me (I work as a custom pesticide applicator and 99.9% of the people in my profession drive trucks).  After a week or so, they had ridden in and driven it enough to have a bit if respect for it.

Most of us guys are rather large - I'm 6' 200 lbs and the smallest guy at work - but we are all reasonably comfortable no matter which seat we are in.  Getting in and out is a bit problematical - and comical, depending on your point of view - for anyone larger than me.  

Anyhow, this car has plenty of power from its 2.0 liter engine for me.  115 you say?  I've been there.  I've read some of the other opinions on here about it being a bit underpowered and can only guess that all of them have automatics and that saps power.  Mine's a 5 speed and has plenty of zip.  What self respecting car lover buys an auto?

I tend to shift at 4 and a half grand and I've many more times than once been shocked at how fast I'm going when I check my speed  500 feet off a stop sign or light.  That 140 mph speedo is fine for some but It's gonna get me into trouble.  The venerable Escort had a 85 mph speedo and I was used to glancing down and knowing how fast I was going by the position of the needle.  That position is closer to 11 oclock than 2 oclock now.

My observed fuel economy thus far - even with my more aggressive driving - is 29 mpg.  Not quite as good as the "superscort" at 32 mpg but not bad by any standard.

I did have the air conditioner compressor bolts retightened under warranty but no other problems have arisen.  I used to change the oil on my Ford, but this one came with 3 years oil changes for 200 bucks (a dealer perk, not a Mazda perk) and the service guy caught the loose bolts before they became a problem.

The only things that I can complain about are little creature comforts.  I don't like the wiper options - no intermittent for drizzly weather.  I don't care for the rear defrost not automatically turning off.  I'm not a big fan of the low profile tires.  I dislike the position of the hazards switch.  The automatically locking rear hatch is not my favorite option (I never locked my Escort's hatch - that was my security against locking my keys in my car...).  Like I said, just creature comforts.  The whole of my dislikes does nothing to detract from my love of this car.

Let's put it simply - This car is a BLAST to drive, inexpensive to own, reliable, and GREAT looking.  

After 7000 miles on the tach, I know I've made the right decision.
