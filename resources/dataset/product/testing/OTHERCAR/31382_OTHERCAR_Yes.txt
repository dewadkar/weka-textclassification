            I am currently leasing a black 2000 alero..and I love it.  I always get looks from other motorists because my car turns their heads. When my brother suggested I get an oldsmobile Alero..my first reaction was &quot;ughhh..oldsmobile?? old people drive oldsmobiles!&quot; but then i saw the alero and i fell in love. It's awesome on the inside and outside. It's roomy for being a coupe (which is what i have) and it's just great. Only a few problems...one..is the gas mileage. I have a 4-cylinder..but it seems to suck up gas like crazy! I hardly drive anywhere...but somehow my gas just seems to disappear. Another thing is that if you are lookign for good acceleration..get a v-6 not the 4 cylinder. I'm going nuts because of the slow acceleration..but once it gets going....it's gone! Another thing are the seats..they are uncomfortable. They are just really hard and after sitting awhile your butt just starts hurting like crazy. My first few weeks after having my car..this may sound funny..but my butt was killing me and i never knew why. lol but after thinking it over it was because of the seats. now i'm used to it..but still..they need to make the seats a little more softer. Another thing is how they have the seat belts.  my passengers have to duck underneath the seat belt or remove it from the plastic holder to get into the back. Maybe they should've placed it in a better way.  All cars have their problems and these are just minor..comparing the fact that this car is a new model..and they haven't worked out all teh kinks. In my opinion, they did a pretty good job in taking care of the kinks before releasing it and frankly, i applaud them for it, just a few more to work out.<br><br>
