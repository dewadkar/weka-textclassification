            My purchase of the AGFA ePhoto Smile was a first attempt at a digital camera.  I plan to wait when digital cameras become more available for lens and filters.

My primary purpose of this purchase was to download to the computer rather than print copy.  From that perspective, the camera worked well with respect to price, resolution, etc.  

My biggest negative to this little unit was that the fact that when transmitting between the camera to the computer is that it literally inhales the battery power and therefore should include an A/C adapter because it is not easy to find a compatible one.  The only place that that I could find such a piece was to go to Radio Shack and purchase a universal adapter.<br><br>
