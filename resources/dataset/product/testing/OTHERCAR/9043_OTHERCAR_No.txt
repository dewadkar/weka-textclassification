            I was convinced early on that the Kia Sportage was for me! I liked the looks of the EX model my associate at work bought and the price tag was reasonable for an SUV.

However, there is NO FREE LUNCH--and the low price on this car should not consume you so much that you fail to test drive and compare options on other models such as the Suzuki Vitara or Grand Vitara.

First of all--my shopping experience and test driving the Kia and its competitors helped me overcome the &quot;buy low&quot; as I soon found out that it truly was not the lowest price in the class. I had a much better negotiation &quot;session&quot; with Suzuki than with Kia.  The Kia does not feel as sturdy, solid, or quiet as its counterpart-the Vitara.  

Opening the liftgate on the back of the car is cumbersome and obnoxious--particularly if you are carrying something and you want to put it in the trunk. You first have to undo the tire assemblage and then use a key to lift open the tailgate.  Very Very Awkward!

Gas Mileage is not as good as the Suzuki models.  The color choices are not as wide as the Vitaras.  The inventory available at dealerships is limited. The rebates are &quot;hype&quot; and there is little room for negotiation beyond them.  Deal with dealers from invoice costs and then subtract the incentives!

The Kia is cute and seemingly inexpensive--but beware of a wolf in sheeps clothing.  Choose Japanese made versus Korean made anyday!
