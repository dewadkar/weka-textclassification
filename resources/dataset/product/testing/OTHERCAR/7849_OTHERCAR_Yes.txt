            For 2001, they�ve fixed this problem. The 2.8 liter is stroked to yield 3.0 liters of displacement. This together with many other refinements adds 32 horsepower, substantially more than $5500 used to get you, for a total of 225. The new car is called the 330i. And, come fall, the 2.5 liter car will be called the 325i. Now that there�s a significant power and displacement difference between the two models (41 horsepower even after the 2.5 gets 14 more in the fall), there�s no need to cloud the issue. The ride is fluid and hushed. 

You feel the road a bit through your seat and the wheel, as you should in a driver's car, but the sensations are desirable communication. They are never harsh, at least not during my drive. The driving position may have played a part. While I usually set the power seats in the cars I drive on their lowest positions, this time I raised the seat about an inch. This made the cowl and beltline seem lower, and the cabin airier. 

These are things I like, so I enjoyed driving the car more. About that sogginess: programmed into the electronic throttle for emissions reasons, perhaps? The 3.0 liter meets ULEV (ultra low emission vehicle) emissions standards. I think it's the only BMW engine to do so. These standards are only met by a few engines currently, and likely require some tricky engine module programming. Engines hooked up to manual transmissions are especially hard to make clean, so this may affect shift quality. 

(The 2.5 even after it is upgraded will still only meet LEV standards, by the way, so it may do better here.) BMW has had a problem on its hands lately. For 2000, they offered two engines in the 3-Series, a 170 hp 2.5 liter and a 193 hp 2.8 liter. Now, 23 horsepower is nothing to sneeze at, but with BMW charging about $5500 more for the larger engine (after adjusting for additional standard equipment), it seemed a touch on the pricey side. To make the difference seem larger than it was, the 2.5 liter car was called the 323i, not the 325i.
