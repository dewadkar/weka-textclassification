            I purchased my 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier in 1996.  The color was my first love (it's Raspberry(pinkish-purple)) but after I drove it, I had to have it.  I came home and begged my husband to let me buy it.  When he saw it, he wasn't impressed.  That just made me want it more because I knew he would never want to drive it.  

It is a demo-model so there are no electric windows or locks, it is an automatic on the floor and it doesn't have cruise-control.  But, I've driven it to North Carolina and back to Indiana.  I didn't care about any of the extras, I just loved the car and still do.  I've not had any problems with it. It has both driver and passenger-side airbags, a very roomy trunk, it was priced right, and the gas mileage is excellent.  I can load up my husband and two children and go wherever we choose.  

I've had a few comments on how the car rides, but I question those passenger's on whether or not they've been the passenger in a Chevy Corvette.  Corvette's cost 3 times more and the ride is horrible, much worse than the Cavalier.  

I love my little car and I would recommend it to anyone.  <br><br>
