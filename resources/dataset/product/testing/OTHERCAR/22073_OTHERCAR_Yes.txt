            The first thing that struck me about this camera is the overall quality of the build. The metal case and rubber grips instill confidence that this is no throw-away camera. It's a bit heavy for a compact camera because of the metal case, but I actually really like it. It's easier to steady a camera with a little more weight and again, it feels good. This camera is actually made in Japan which is rare these days.

If you are looking for a nice easy way to get snapshots onto your computer, this is the way to go. Don't expect this particular model to replace a nice 35mm SLR. Do expect it to take excellent snapshot pictures that rival the nicest point-and-shoot. 

Digital photography is terrific because you can see the results immediately and you have the freedom to take lots of shots. If a shot looks bad just erase it. It changes the way you think about taking pictures.

One problem is that the camera does not come with a USB interface. Instead you must download images via your serial port (slooowwww). Also, the memory card included is a mere 4MB. That stores about 12 high-resolution images. There is a Millenium edition of the camera that comes with a USB card reader or you can buy one yourself (highly recommended). Check out Buy.com for good deals on card readers and smart cards. I found a reader for $35 and a 16MB smart card for about $25. 

Overall an excellent camera that you will be very happy with if you're looking for a digital replacement for your point-and-shoot.
