                     There is nothing quite like driving a car with a six cylinder engine. The maxima has the pickup of a school boy sitting on a hot, stone slab. This car handles better than any &quot;luxury&quot; car on the market. The best part is the price. Price ranges around 25000g's. Other models like the lexus can nail; you for up around thirtyfive or forty thousand if not more. The maxima is also very spacious inside. I t could be compared to driving your living room at an obsurd velocity. Surprisingly, the gas mileage is good. Anywhere from 26 to 33 mpg. For those of you out there that like fast fast cars, you have met your match. Having owned a maxima, I can say that this car can be alot of fun on the highway. Please be safe. Anyway, the maxima is worth every penny someone might pay for it. A smooth drive, fast ride, the maxima is definetly a good buy.<br><br>
