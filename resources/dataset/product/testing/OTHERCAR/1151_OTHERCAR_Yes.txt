            I needed a new car.  Mine had seen it's day.  I went on the 'net' and searched for a car that would fit my budget and my needs.  The Neon did it all.  I still went and test drove the comparable cars.  Once I got in the Neon and drove it.  I was sold!  

The Neon is sporty, and practical.  I went to the dealer and told them I needed a Neon and the only things that I required were both side mirrors and air conditioning.  We looked at what was available and I didn't have a big choice.  There were only 2 on the lot that were 5 speeds.  I told the salesman to figure out a lease on one of them, I didn't care which one, they both were close to the same price.  The next day he called and said I was approved and to come in the next day to get my car.   I didn't know which one I bought until I signed the papers!  It was the showroom car!  Silver with all the goodies.  CD player, dual heated mirrors, remote access door locks and factory alarm.   I love my car.  It is small so I don't have any trouble parking.  It has a lot of get up and go.  I have travelled on short trips and it handles great.  It came with 5 cup holders and lots of compartments in the doors and center console.  The seats are very comfortable.  They come in either sporty cloth covered or single color.

I also got the good rims on mine.  On the ES model they are standard.  I get a lot of compliments especially from young men! 

The only cons for the car is the back of it sits pretty high.  I am not used to that.  I take extra caution when backing out.  

I would recommend this car to a single person or a small family.  It seats 4 comfortably.<br><br>
