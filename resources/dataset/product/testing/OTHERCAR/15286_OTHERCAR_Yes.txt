            We have had our Sony Mavica for a year-and-a-half.  I have used a number of digital cameras and we tried out even more in the shops in Tokyo before we bought it.

The best feature has to be the disk drive - no need to worry about running out of some expensive little memory stick - just buy a new box of disks.  In fact we did run out of disks on our trip to the Grand Canyon but we figured we weren't far from somebody with a PC! We managed to persuade the Helicopter operator company to sell us a box of disks.

Get home and immediately stick the disk in and upload/view the images.  The camera creates a simple HTML file as an index to the images so it's easy to flick through them.

At a friends house?  No worries - they're bound to have a PC and of course it's got a floppy drive.  No problem showing your last few days of pics to them.

I have a friend back in the UK that actually takes his PC on his ski trips with him *just* so that he can download pictures from his digital camera! No need with the Mavica.

Another great feature is the big screen on the back of the camera.  It continuously updates when you are framing a shot.  This doesn't sound like much but it is so much easier to use than certain other cameras which only update every second or so.  I'm convinced that the screen display is the reason that our four-year-old can take perfect pictures with this camera.  It also means that you don't have to have one eye on the scene and another on the screen.

The image quality is superb in good light.  We have found it doesn't take the best night shots - there is a powerful flash but it can be a little overpowering sometimes.

If you are an SLR buff moving to digital, you would definitely want to move up the Mavica range from the FD81.  However for any vacation/family shots or taking pics for display on the web, selling on eBay etc, I'd recommend the FD81.

The battery life is very good. Better still, it always tells you how many minutes you've got left. On vacation, it usually lasts us a few days taking photos and movies every day.<br><br>
