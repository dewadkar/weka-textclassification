            We have had a 1995 Plymouth voyager now for almost 5 years. It has approximately 40,000 miles on it. The brakes went at 25,000 miles. My driving habits have not changed at all and I have not had to replace brakes prior to 50,000 miles before in my 16 years of owning cars. The cruise control required 3 separate visits to the shop (when it was brand new!) to fix. The interior hardware is all falling apart, and I have received 2 recall notices so far. I have a bad feeling about the transmission, it &quot;clunks&quot; about half the time when you switch gears.

Even if you have young children, I would recommend the 2 captain seats in the 2nd row. The car seats can easily go in the 3rd row, but if you get the bench in the second row, once the kids are a bit older it is quite uncomfortable to sit in.


Our other car is a Toyota Corrolla, it is our 2nd one and we are quite pleased w/ it. So next minivan will probably be a Toyota or Honda.<br><br>
