            We finally decided to get rid of the lemon Plymouth Voyager I was driving and get a car.  I hated the idea of giving up all of that room, but we just couldn't afford another mini-van.

I'd never even HEARD of an LSS before, but after endless test driving, this was the only car I thought that would even come close to compensating for the loss of room.

All of the gadgets, and there are a lot of them, still worked perfectly in this 4 year old car.  One feature about it I do not like, however, is the passenger side air-bag.  I can't allow my children to ride up front because of this, and it can't be de-activated.

We decided to call my husband's uncle before purchasing this car.  He has always favored Oldsmobile, and we wanted to find out what he liked about them.  His first comment was that they run forever.  He's had 2 now that ran well over 200,000 miles, including the one he is currently driving.  His second reason was the great gas mileage he has always gotten, and they do a LOT of traveling.  He also pointed out that the parts were GM and easy to get at reasonable prices. This was enough for me, we bought the car and have not been disappointed.

I recently took it to Michigan, about a 200 mile trip, and got 32 miles to the gallon gas mileage.  This was great, because it allowed me to fill up in Indiana (where gas is cheaper) and not have to fill up again until I got back across the state line again 2 days later.

The ride is VERY smooth in this car.  Anyone's whose ever driven across Michigan's roads will know this is a definite plus! Even at speeds over 75 it was smooth sailing. (Just SLIGHTLY over :-)

But, I guess the toughest test this car has passed has been when my 16 year old stepson who is adamant about getting a &quot;sports car&quot; to drive, said it was a cool car, and wouldn't mind driving a 4 door if it was like mine!  Who knew I had such cool taste!
