            I am a 25 year old female who has been in love w/this type of car since age 15. At this time I've owned 2, an 83' and an 85'(presently)  This is a great car for many reasons......of course one is because of how great it looks.  This is a beautiful car from inside to out!  It has a sleek body w/a hugging interior, great around corners, and oh did I mention, FAST!  This car is definitely an eye catcher!!!  I must admit, the oldest and newest body styles are my favorite, I'm not to fond of the middle body style- looks just don't compare to the others.  If you have a chance to drive this car, take it, once you do you will want to own one!  For my next purchase, it will most definitely be the last and best body style.
