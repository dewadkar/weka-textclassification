            It was the beginning of my Junior year in high school, and my parents decided it was time to buy me a car. We shopped around for a couple of days. I narrowed my choice down to three cars: a Cavalier, a Sunfire, and a Saturn. Once I saw the Saturn, I fell in love with it. I planned on getting a two door car to have a more sporty look. The appearance was not the only good thing about it. There were other features that caught my parents' eye. Considering it is the second safest car in the world, my parents thought this was great for their teenage daughter. The inside was very attractive and not to mention roomy. Saturns also have great gas mileage. My family likes Saturns so much that not only do I have one, but my two sisters drive Saturns too.<br><br>
