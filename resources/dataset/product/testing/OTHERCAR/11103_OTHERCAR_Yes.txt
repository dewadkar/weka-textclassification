            I have a Ricoh RDC-2 and I'm pretty thrilled with it.
Its not as great as the expensive high tech cameras I have used, but for a reletively inexpensive camera it works great.
I use it to take pictures of items for my ebay auctions primarily.
You really don't need a 2.3 megapixel camera for ebay auctions, those larger file sizes just slow down the load times of your auction pages.
The .4 Mpixel pics from this Ricoh give a clear pic while retaining a small file size.
People who don't want to spend alot of money, but need a camera to post pics online for websites or online auctions should consider the Richoh.
With all the bells and whistles it starts to get the price up, but mine came bare bones and is inexpensive that way. While the bare bones system doesn't have the conveniences of the led veiwscreen and remote, those extras are really not necesary if you are looking for something very useable and inexpensive <br><br>
