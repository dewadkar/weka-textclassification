            The 1999 Honda CR-V is much roomier that any of the other &quot;mini&quot; SUV's.  The only competitor that comes close is the Toyota Rav4.  The Suzuki and KIA are much smaller and less powerful than either. In comparing the two, the Toyota rides like a Toyota truck, where the Honda has more of a car feel. Both have reclining back seats.  The Honda has much more leg room in the back seat.  I put two average size adult men in the back of each and had to move the front seats forward to allow them to be comfortable in the Toyota.  The Honda has a two piece rear hatch as opposed to the Toyota's one piece.  Both have adequate storage areas. The Rav4 has some interesting options like removable tote bags that hang on the back door.  One of the things I noticed on the pricing was that the Rav4 has very little included in the invoice base vehicle.  Even A/C is not standard.  So in looking at base prices, the Rav4 was cheaper but with similar options it was significantly more expensive than the CR-V.  One of the standard features on the CR-V that blew me away is a built in small folding table and ice chest.  A great feature for concert and game goers.  The CR-V lags a little going up mountain highways compared to my 4 cylinder Toyota truck.  Toyota Rav4 has standard 4WD as an option to front wheel drive. CR-V has &quot;real-time 4WD&quot; standard.  Which means that it automatically goes to 4WD when the wheels slip without the driver doing anything.  The jury is still out on if this is preferrable to on-demand 4WD.  My impression is that if you want to go out rock climbing, the RAV4 would be preferable though the CR-V has a little more clearance.  You wouldn't know it from sitting in them. The Rav4 makes you feel like you are sitting higher than the CR-V.  But then I wouldn't look at mini SUV's if rock climbing was my goal. I purchased a 1999 CR-V with tinted windows, floor mats, and a roof rack added on for $18,400 through internet shopping.  All in all, no major complaints with the CR-V and if you want plenty of cargo room and comfort for more than 2 adults in a mini SUV, it is the best of the bunch.  <br><br>
