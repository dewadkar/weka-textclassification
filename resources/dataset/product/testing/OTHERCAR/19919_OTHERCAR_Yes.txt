            OK, it's a beautiful car.  And classy.  And drives like a dream.  So what's my problem with it?

Perhaps we should not have looked at the new Mercedes, then bought the Jag the very next day.  I keep thinking it has certain features, then remember that it was the Mercedes that had them.  Silly little features, I guess, but they're also fun ones.  A storage bin between the front seats that is cooled by the a/c system, for instance!

But some of the features I wish we had aren't so silly.  The Mercedes came with a communications system that connected you directly with a &quot;help!&quot; center.  Rather like -- exactly like, I suppose -- the Onstar system you see advertised.  (And which turns out to be only available for GM cars and Saabs.)

With the Jag you have to make a choice.  There's a spot on the console which can hold either a wired-in phone or a GPS system.  Not both.  We chose the GPS system, and will supplement it with a regular cellular phone.  So no one will know if our air bags go off or we encounter major problems unless we call them on the phone.  (There's a number you can call that will send you help to fix a flat, etc, -- all the same things you get from AAA, which we already had.)

But my main problem with this lovely car is that it's damn inconvenient in certain ways.  It's the lack of front seat storage that gets me down the most.  There's hardly any!  The glove compartment is aptly named -- there's room in it for one glove.  The rest is taken up by the CD player.  Oy.  (The Mercedes CD player is in the trunk, which I suppose would be a nuisance for some people.) The little map holders on the doors are so skimpy they won't even hold a pocket pack of Kleenex!  

I'm having a hard time with the GPS system, too, although I'm used to GPS on a boat.  The extra features such as a listing of restaurants, gas stations, etc. don't work most of the time.

I no longer smoke, but if I did, I'd be infuriated by the skimpy ashtray.

The passenger-side seatbelt is very hard to fasten, and unfastening it isn't much fun, either -- I've already broken one nail doing it.

It seems to me that for this amount of money, you shouldn't have any annoyances at all!

My previous car -- the one just before the Jag -- was a Prizm.  What a contrast?  Not really.  It was a truly nice car, and there are days I miss it a lot.  (The trade-in on it probably paid for one hubcap of the Jag...)

The strangest thing about having the Jag is the difference it's made in our relations with the world.  It is a car which attracts a lot of attention, and that can be fun.  But, for instance, there's a woman across the street with whom we had a friendly, waving relationship.  Now she glares at us!   And, incredibly, I have to find a new cleaning lady since the old one raised her price about 33 percent when we got the new car!
