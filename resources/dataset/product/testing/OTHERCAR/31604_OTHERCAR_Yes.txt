            I have had my CoolPix 800 for some months now and couldn't be more satisfied.  I had wanted a digital camera ever since the first one came out but I knew that waiting for better would be more practical for me.  Living on my budget doesn't allow for buy new now and buy better later.  I did my homework, and while the ease of storage on a floppy appealed to me, the low resolution didn't.  Neither did lugging around a disc drive all the time.  

My husband had introduced me to his 35mm Nikon camera post-Viet Nam and I had become an avid photographer.  He got me my own smaller Nikon so we could each have access to picture-taking at the same time.  When I saw that Nikon had gotten into the digital market, I knew the time had come for me to do some serious studying of the possibilities.  I held on and was patient until the 800 came along.  The multitude of features plus the affordable price did it for me and as soon as I had gotten my annual bonus, I was heading for the checkout.

I have taken pictures of EVERYTHING.  One day my food scraps were particularly colorful and I took a couple of shots.  Going digital is the best thing I have done for my photography hobby.  My granddaughter is very photogenic so I have lots of pictures of her.  I keep most of them--even the &quot;bad&quot; ones--simply because they are history.  I have a CD-writer which makes it very easy to store the large unresized files.  I have taken the bulk of my pictures in the Fine mode which makes for huge pictures but I would rather save them that way (I didn't at first) and be able to manipulate them from there than resize them and wish I hadn't.

The low-light situation is the one thing that needs improvement, in my opinion.  However, I can usually improve on a too-dark picture with one of my image programs.  

I bought a charger and two sets of rechargeable batteries so there is never a reason for me to quit taking pictures as far as power is concerned.  I also invested in a card reader for about $40 and it really simplifies the process of transferring the files from the compact flashcard to the computer.  It shows up as a removable disc drive and I can access it with any of my image programs.  I have the original 8 MB card that came with the camera, plus I got a 32 MB and a 64 MB as well.  I could take pictures all day long and not run out of space and all three plus the camera will fit into the little camera bag with room to spare.  Beats carrying around a box of floppies.

The quality of the pictures was emphasized recently when I had opportunity to see the side-by-side comparison.  Two of my relatives who own The Other Camera were at a family function where we all took pictures of a lot of the same things.  I received, via e-mail, their efforts and uploaded them all to the same site where family members could view them.  When my son saw the results, he was amazed.  He is in the market for a digital camera, too, and I THINK he will get a Nikon.<br><br>
