            After ten years with a Buick, we purchased a Dodge Caravan (1995) for our growing family.  Then the fun began.........The transmission has slipped since day one with numerous visits to the dealer.  The transmission control module malfunctioned on more than one occasion and had to be replaced (that part is necessary for the automatic transmission to automatically shift.)  The rear-side  window motors work when they want to and have been replaced at least twice.  The trim around the driver's door has been loose since the purchase (it's actually secured with Velcro-boy do I feel safe.) The oil light does not work (also checked by dealer) and has run completely dry due to the fact that it burns almost as much oil as gas.  I had my rear latch recalled and now have to worry about the air bag &quot;inadvertently&quot; deploying when I start the engine until I have time to donate the van to the dealership for several days for the latest recall.  Now, with one month left on a 60 month loan, the paint on the roof is simply cracking and peeling away.  There may be more, but my memory fails me.  What scent do I request at the car wash?  CITRUS - because Chrysler makes LEMONS and I got one!<br><br>
