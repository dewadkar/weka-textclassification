            The A6 is simply great !!! I love everything about this car... it has a beautiful exterior and interior, a perfect balance between comfort and handling, a lot of room and almost everything you would need in a car plus more.

When it comes to car design and technology Audi has always been ahead of its competition and this is just another example. The attention to detail is evident everywhere you look in the car and the quality of the materials are just first rate.

I had a tough choice choosing between the BMW 528 i, the Mercedes E 320 and the Audi A6 2.7t. However checking out these 3 cars carefully, the A6 became the best choice for me. Then i had to choose between the A6 2.8 and the 2.7t. I found that the 2.8 had more than enough power for me, even in the low gears(the transmission has been adjusted for the 2000 model year). If i really want some fun on the back roads, the &quot;tiptronic&quot; (Auto/manual transmission) feature is very useful and the quattro system provides very good handling. For really fast driving the A6 2.7t or the A6 4.2 maybe very good choices. I am very happy with my choice and have no complaints so far. The A6 is comfortable and has a lot of room even in the rear (more than both the rival 5 series and the e-class). I enjoy the bright red fiber optic interior lighting during night time and also the high quality plastic, polished aluminum, wood and leather interior.

The A6 as a range has already won several awards such as (Best Luxury car - Motorweek, 10 Best for 2000 - Car &amp; Driver, North American Car of the Year Finalist, Highest Rated $40k Luxury sedan - Consumer reports and was recently voted the best 40k luxury sedan by car and driver in the comparison test of the May '00 issue ... and the list could go on).
The A6 could easily be the best car in it's class and i have been very happy with it. I would definitely recommend it to any car enthusiast who is interested in fun to drive German luxury sport sedans.
