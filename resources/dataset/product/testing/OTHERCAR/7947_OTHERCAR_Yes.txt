            Albeit I am 18 years old.

Yes I have only been driving for two years.

Yes I have only owned one car.

But darn it if I dont love my jeep more than any other possession on this planet. Jeep's are funny, everyone I know who owns one loves it...I mean loves it. People are passionate about their jeeps, I think a large part of that has to do with the fact that they are so customizable. I've designed my jeep to reflect me, with a lift, fog lights, step bars, I've taken off the doors, taken off the top. Everything you do with your jeep is uniquely YOU. Now I would highly suggest a Wrangler for any parent searching for their child's car. Contrary to prior belief the Wrangler is NOT a death trap. 

Ever since it's redesign in '97 the Wrangler has crash tested EXTREMELY well. And to answer your question NO it is not as easy to flip as you think, I drive like a maniac and have never come close. The Wrangler also isn't exactly what I would call a speed demon, whenever mine goes past 90 it rattles like a every screw is about to pop loose (take that as you will ;). All in all everyone in the hunt for a new SUV should take a serious look at the Wrangler its fun, sporty and good looking. 

If you are looking at a higher priced vehicle why not save some money on the Wrangler and use the extra to customize it???<br><br>
