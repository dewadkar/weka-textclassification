            Even though I see a few others have already written excellent reviews of this camera, I'm still excited about purchasing mine - and thought I'd chime in.

After doing a considerable bit of price/feature comparisons for a digital camera in the $200 and under category, I ended up with the Kodak CX4300.  WalMart sells them for $179.95 (only $30 more than the price of the comparable 2.1 megapixel version!).

For the money, I think this camera covers all the important bases.  You get an LCD screen to preview your photos (which you're not going to have on the sub $100 dig. cameras as a rule), a glass lens instead of a lower-quality plastic one, a built-in flash with red-eye reduction (a key feature, IMO!) plus ability to use only "fill flash" (also key!), a timer (so you can get into your own photos), the best resolution in its class (at 3MP), and backed by a company that's been doing cameras and film for a LONG time.

Compared to some other digital cameras I've used (including a $700 or so Sony Mavica), I think this Kodak does an impressive job of properly capturing colors and handling indoor lighting.  (On the Mavica I used, I often had problems with indoor photos coming out too dark, and requiring some touch-up in Photoshop before they looked really good.)  As for colors, the cheaper digital cameras often don't capture darker shades of red/burgandy/maroon properly.  I had no such issue with this Kodak.

On the downside though, the camera does have a few small flaws and faults. My lens cap fits fine (unlike one reviewers', apparently), but I'm not really thrilled that it has one in the first place.  Their cheaper 2.1MP camera has a built-in lens cover that shutters over the lens whenever you switch off the power.  I'd prefer that so there's one less thing to lose or break.  I also ran into the problem of the directional toggle button accidently thinking I pushed a direction when I was trying to push down the middle of it to confirm a menu choice.  Some sort of true optical zoom would have been nice, too.  I think I would have paid an extra $20-25 for that, if it was available.

I also agree with the reviewer who complained that at $70, the optional "EasyShare dock" is a marketing ploy.  How hard is to push a USB cable into the side of the camera and have your PC auto-detect it and start transferring photos?  The camera simply doesn't *need* a dock to make this operation easier.  The charger built in the dock is great, but it should have come with the camera.
