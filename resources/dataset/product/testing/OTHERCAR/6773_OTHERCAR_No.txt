            People that buy a Plymouth Breeze or Plymouth Neon with the 2.0L engine should be aware of the 'known' oil leaks that this engine has.  My repair garage knew exactly what was leaking in 3 different places and that a new revised head gasket is available to fix one of the problems.  At 43k miles I require a head gasket, cam seals and oil sending switch.  I'm a mid fifties person and a very careful cautious driver.  I really do not expect these type of repairs at this mileage.  For some reason these problems surfaced in the very cold weather, zero degrees.  It started with the oil sending unit switch that I was lucky to catch because it leaked 2.5 quarts of oil in 5 days.  With that under control a few days later I discovered more oil leaking, this time on the drivers side of the car, camshaft seals.  A few days later oil was found on the other side of the cylinder head. This time it is the head gasket. This car has not overheated and I had changed the antifreeze 6 months ago.  The car is maintained with oil changes every three thousand miles, and whatever the book calls for on required maintenance. <br><br>
