              Purchased a flame red '99 durango slt brand new. Fit and finish is poor, plasticy interior ill fitting body seams. The a/c is the poorest I've ever had,took 4 friends to a meeting 80 miles away and they all said the air seemed weak. the dealership checked it out and said it was up to specs! It was in for a new transmission valve at 3500k, was in for 5 days. Also the front tires were being chewed up from the inside at only7k. Have been told the suspensions a arms are a major problem in durango and rams. Girl at work owns same year and we both had to laugh we have had the same problems. My truck was hit head on and recieved 7000.00 worth of damage, was fixed to perfection,so I traded it off. Now own a 2000 isuzu rodeo...much happier all the way around. Did I mention the power windows on all 4 doors were working spuratically? All 4 motors were replaced. Also had a small oil leak from day one.On a good note all was under warranty for free(as well it should be) and the dealership and service techs were excellent. Provided a cirrus rental with out asking. Still be advised and ask current owners of any problems.Lots of power
from a 5.3 ltr but averaged about 10-12 mpg.<br><br>
