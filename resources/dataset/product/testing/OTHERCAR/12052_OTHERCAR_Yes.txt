            The Honda S2000 is a great sports car and is one of the better cars Honda has made.  The S2000 features optimum 50/50 front to rear weight distribution, rigid body construction, and a double wishbone front and rear suspension.  Did I mention that the Honda S2000 is very fast? The engine is a rev-happy 2.0-liter/240hp inline-four that pairs with a six speed manual transmission to produce 5.8-second, 0-60mph. The engine is said to be very reliable.  The inside of the car is very comfortable, with leather seats.  There isn't a whole lot of room in the back but there is enough to fit two people in the back.  So take my word when I say that this car is AWESOME!! :)<br><br>
