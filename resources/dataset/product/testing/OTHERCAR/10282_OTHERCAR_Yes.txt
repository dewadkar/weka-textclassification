            I bought this car a few months back and find that it is dependable and gets very good gas mileage.  It gets 40 miles to one gallon of gas for highway driving, 30 miles in the city. It handles very well unlike some other compact cars. It is sporty and classy looking both at once. I bought this car so I could have a reliable car to drive on long trips. I highly recommend Nissan Sentra it has been nothing but good for me. Worth the money I paid. Customer service has been excellent.<br><br>
