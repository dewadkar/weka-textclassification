            I've owned and driven mostly sports cars and SUVs, but I was incredibly impressed with the smooth quiet ride and the comfort of the Suzuki Grand Vitara. My girlfriend just bought this car new at a dealership in Salt Lake City and we drove it from Salt Lake City, Utah to Virginia Beach, Virginia. Our deadline for reaching Virginia Beach was the arrival of an ABF shipment of furniture which was scheduled to arrive about a week from the time we left. Having a few days at our disposal, we decided to avoid the snow covered roads in the Rocky Mountains and head toward Zion National Park and the desert before heading East.

Since I enjoy driving and my girlfriend doesn't, I was at the wheel the majority of the time driving more than 8 hours per day. I've made lots of long road trips in my 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse; often driving for 20 or more hours straight. I think that I could easily have performed the same duration in comfort in the Grand Vitara. This car was able to handle the snow in Utah as well as the off highway driving of some rustic desert travel. It performed well when dodging rush hour traffic in cities and is an excellent car to take to the beach. 

The biggest factor that influenced our driving time, was my girlfriend's 2 year-old son. He doesn't yet have the patience for long drives. Parents will be glad to know that the Grand Vitara's interior will survive the onslaught of a child who kicks seat backs & attacks the dashboard like a great white shark after a seal. After a month of abuse by a child before its first major cleaning, the Grand Vitara was able to shed the french fries, ketchup stains, scuff marks and dirt and return to showroom condition within 2 hours.

The interior is incredibly user friendly. Seats are easily raised and lowered providing ample cargo space depending upon your needs. There are two spacious utility trays beneath the driver and passenger seats. The back seats form a couch that comfortably seats 3 with a center seatbelt. It is very easy to install child safety seats and get a child into the vehicle. Maximum passenger seating is 5. There is room for cargo behind the seats and also a roof rack. Also, the access to the jack is quick since it is located to the left of the rear door in the paneling. The jack removes and stows easily and the paneling is simple to remove and replace. 

The only thing I didn't like about the Grand Vitara is that you really feel like you could tip the SUV when cornering.  

She had previously owned a Montero and misses that SUV when compared to the Grand Vitara, but personally, I like the sporty stylish look of the Suzuki Grand Vitara much better. Since I had owned a Geo Tracker in college and my friends Mark and Will owned Suzuki Samurais, I found the Grand Vitara to be the ultimate in luxury compared to these smaller SUVs. The Grand Vitara won't out class SUVs like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but if you are searching for a comfortable, affordable and sporty SUV, the Grand Vitara is a solid choice.
