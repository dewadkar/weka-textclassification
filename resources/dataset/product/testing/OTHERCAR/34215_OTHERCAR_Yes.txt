            The A.M. General Hummer is an excellent piece of craftsmanship and a beast of a truck. I bought mine in July of 02' and am in love with it; personally I use it as mainly an off-road car ONLY since the gas mileage is very poor. Although with the Hummer I do enjoy the looks from people as I drive by.
     First off Why I personally like the hummer is its sheer ability to handle any situation you throw in front of it. I have gone through 40 inches of water and rode through inches of mud with no problem at all. I also have taken my Hummer sanding out by the lake which was a blast. Also I enjoy the Monsoon sound system that came equipped in it which was enough wattage to satisfy my needs. I have always wanted a hummer and finally was able to afford one without having to pay for the rest of my life.
      About the Hummer itself.
      -I purchased the 4 person 6 door wagon model since that best suited my needs.
      -Comes with a 190Hp engine that offers a large amount of torque which makes it able to handle the obstacles of off-roading.
      -I also added the tall snorkel so that I could go into deeper water since the Hummer is 99% water tight
      -The gas mileage I have found to be about 12MPG on the highway and about 10MPG elsewhere. 
      -One accessory you should definitely get is the winch. The 6 ton winch is a life saver for you and other off-roaders in a bind.
       ******One problem with the winch is that when you have one you cannot immediately go up an incline that is more than about 40degrees without the winch you are able to go at a 70 degree hill. This is normally not a problem but can be in some situations.
      -Over all you should check the hummer website at www.hummer.com for exact info.

I would only suggest this for someone who doesn't mind plopping down the $130,000 total for what is mainly a "toy" since it cannot be used as far as I think as a daily travel/commute car. The gas cost is much too high. It does run on diesel which in some areas makes it hard to find but normally is not a problem.
     It definitely lived up to my expectations and over. There is a lot of preventative maintenance when off-roading and allot of maintenance to repair damage when it occurs. Normally nothing to major for me yet. 
     Avoid this car if you aren't into off-roadng otherwise there is no use for it I feel. 
     I would recommend it for those that are not very economically minded but if you can afford it without paying for it with your soul I would definitely invest in one.
