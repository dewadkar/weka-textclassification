            The Toyota Celica's bulbous shape makes a distinctive design statement. The Celica's gently rounded, almost pudgy look speaks volumes to people who said the Toyota styling was as bland as a saucer of egg whites. But when the Toyota stylists redrew the Celica for open-air status, they had to give up one of the coupe's most distinctive features which was the swooping roof line and curvaceous rear window.

The standard features in this car includes a tilt wheel, power windows, a fold down rear seat with a pass to the trunk and a driver side airbag. These options are short but sweet you can also choose from a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic transmission and then add air conditioning, power lock, a rear spoiler, alloy wheels, fog lights and cruise control.

The Celica's driving ability is little to complain about, the front wheel drive, sixteen valve, 130-bhp has ample power to make any trip a exciting one.
