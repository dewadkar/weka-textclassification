            After deciding my C-5 Corvette was just getting too expensive to keep as a daily driver, I decided that a more practical car was what I really needed.  None of the current offerings of American iron seemed to fit the void left by the sportiness of the Vette coupled with the necessity of some practicality. I looked at the BMW 3-series and was surprised (read: shocked!) at the sticker price and the cost of any options I deemed necessary (sport package, upgraded radio, etc). Toyota and Honda had excellent, practical cars in their own right, but they still "missed the mark" for something with even a smidgen of "fun-factor" built in.

Then I stumbled onto the 2002 Nissan Maxima SE.

Let's see...4 door practicality, solid build, a "big" 6-cylinder engine, and.......OHMYGOD!!! a 6-spd transmission!!! A test drive was soon arranged and I was hooked.

The car exibits effortless power on the open road. Unless you are loafing along in high gear, a quick stab of the "go-fast" pedal soon sends 255 horsepower to assist you in quickly outpacing most of the traffic. The standard 6 speed transmission has well spaced gear ratios with the only complaint being the notchiness of the shifter. Some of that should go away when the characteristics of the slightly loose shift pattern become more familiar.

The interior is well laid out, with radio and climate controls falling easily to hand. Radio and cruise controls are positioned on the steering wheel. The seats are firm and supportive, with the driver's side having multiple power adjustments.  If you insist that cows must shed their skins for your driving comfort, the leather option adds the same touches to the passenger seat. A power sunroof is optional. If you get the sunroof, make sure you also get the optional wind screen. The trunk is adequate for a normal trip's worth of luggage. The rear seats fold down and opens up the trunk for bigger items such as skis or other longer items. Liftover access to the trunk is very good.  

Build quality and the fit and finish is on par with autos in the near-luxury class (Infiniti, Lexus, etc).  the materials, even in the standard interior, are of high quality. 

So, who should consider this car? Anyone needing a comfortable, practical automobile but still wanting to retain some driving enjoyment during that daily trek to work. 

This car satisfies the requirements of both sides of the human brain.
