            My husband and I traded our '99 Chevrolet Blazer in for two vehicles, one of them being a 2001 Cavalier LS.  I had to admit, that when we first got it, I never thought I would be able to get used to driving such a small car, after being spoiled with the Blazer for 2 years.  Now that we've had it, I absolutely adore it!  Let me tell you a few things that we discovered when doing some research on the Cavaliers.

We tested a couple Cavaliers when we were trying to decide exactly what we wanted.  One of the things we had read in previous reviews was that the engine was noisy.  I have to agree that the car is somewhat noisy, but the 2.2L engine is substantially more noisy than the 2.4L. 

We had also read that the 3 speed automatic didn't get as nearly as good gas mileage as the 4 speed.  So what we ended up purchasing happened to be the best combination: the 2.4L 4-speed engine.  I think that anyone looking to buy a Cavalier, should go with this combination if they can afford it.  I happen to get no less than 30mpg gas mileage, which is mostly highway.  Big difference from the 20mpg which we got with the Blazer!!!

Primarily, I am the only one who drives the Cavalier, but we have had guests (adults) sit in the back seat and have had no complaints on long trips as far as the ride being uncomfortable.  I have sat in the back seat (on the test drive, because we had read that people have complained of lack of space) and I HAVE sat in the back seat behind my husband, who isn't a small guy, and had no problems with being uncomfortable. By the way, this is the 4-door, I'm speaking of. 

We've had it for 6 months now, and from the very beginning it had a problem with the steering groaning on turns.  They had to replace a plate on the driver's side front wheel, because something was rubbing.  Things are fine now, it only took them a couple of hours to replace.

One of the best things about the Cavalier, is that it handles really well in the snow.  The traction control comes with the 4-speed transmission, which is another plus point.

You know how there's some little things that just "annoy" you, but don't actually affect how the car preforms?  Here's one of mine:  In the automatic (which what we got), the button to press to move the shifter is on TOP of the shifter, which is really un-natural, it should be on the side.  I have no idea why they did that.

I have read rave reviews about the trunk, and they're all true!  I was so surprised at the room that little car holds!
