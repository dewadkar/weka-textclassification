            My purchase of a Honda Insight was a result of extreme skepticism.  My experience in renting or driving econoboxes has not been good, and I knew that Insight had some peculiar qualities, such as terminating the A/C compressor and/or defroster at &quot;idle stop&quot;, which most people might not like.  When VP Gore called for a subsidy for vehicles like this, I recoiled with the angst that most people do when they hear him propose something.  So I wrote a column that appeared nationwide that dissed the Insight.

I felt guilty, having driven Honda cars for several hundred thousand miles with good results, and decided to finally find an Insight to drive.  I was more than pleasantly surprised, and realized that I might as well fess up to the error of my ways and buy one. Which I did.

It is a  spectacular automobile, once you begin to appreciate its technology and learn a bit about its slightly quirky driving habits (e.g. it gets better fuel economy if you boot it around a bit at low speed!). I would recommend the Insight to anyone who loves to see what the human mind can do when it is asked to do good, as the Insight does very well.  Breezing down the road at 70mph/70mpg, which Insight will do, with all of the usual pleasing Honda traits onboard, is clearly the best driving experience I have had in probably over 500,000 miles behind the wheel. This car is a steal at the 20K price, as it easily contains about 40K (after allowing for markup) worth of innovative technology. 

Think of it this way.  If you buy one, and it is the technology of the future, you have one of the first 5000 copies available in the US (currently about 2000 have been sold). If it completely fails and is dropped off the line,  you now have an Edsel.  Both are big-time collector items.  You can't lose at this price, and it is a magnificently charming automobile.  Go drive one (if you can find one)...I challenge you to disagree with my analysis of this brilliant product. It is the only car in my fairly long life that I have been truly proud to own. <br><br>
