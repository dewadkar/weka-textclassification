            I had a '97 Jeep Grand Cherokee and wanted a little bigger and more power.  I had looked at Expeditions, but they were a little out of range.  I started looking at the Durangos when Chrysler started its financing incentives on the 2000 models.  I purchased the vehicle at the end of November, 2000.

First off, let me say that this SUV has the smoothest ride of any I've ever been in.  One always expects a truck-like ride in these vehicles, but that's not what it is.  It's very car-like, very smooth, and doesn't have all the bouncing around that you can get in a truck.

Unfortunately, things drop off from there.  I realize that I settled for the "Sport" model, which is the low-end model; but, it's still quite expensive and has few included features.  I would think by now that auto manufacturers realized that CD players are almost a necessity, but this model doesn't come with one.  It also had a bench front seat, which I didn't think people even used anymore.  It does, however, have a huge center console, and when the console is down it makes it seem that the seats are bucket seats.  And, at least, the sides of the bench do adjust independently.  The comfort of the seats leaves something to be desired.  They feel, and even look, like nothing more than boxes with foam and upholstery -- a stadium seat with padding, if you will.  And the lack of an adjustable headrest is very noticeable.

I was disappointed with the tire size on this model.  Again, I realize it is the low-end model, but larger tires should be included.  A warning:  at least for me, the vehicle tends to "scoot" around when I hit rough spots on roads.  Especially when turning, if I hit a patch of road that has, say, a few small bumps (not holes), the back end of the vehicle tends to move around.  This even occurs at low speeds.  It's a little unsettling considering it moves the car considerably.  I intend to ask about this next time I take it in.

Roominess is great.  Plenty to stretch out.  I did opt for the third seat.  It was ok for me (I'm 6'1") but I wouldn't want to sit there for long.  It was put to use soon after getting the vehicle, hauling 6 family members around town during the holidays.  It did that just fine.  When the third seat is down there is plenty of room for hauling everything from groceries to bags of dirt.

The interior is quite spartan, and I still don't understand why automakers don't include floor mats!  It makes no sense to me.  The interior is at least very quiet when traveling.  Not too much outside noise makes it in.  The doors close with a nice, resounding thud.  I like that.

Configuring the interior to haul things is very easy and can be done by a lone individual.  The second row seats flip forward with only one lever, and you don't have to remove the seat headrests like on my last two vehicles.  That's a nice switch.  And when all seats are lowered, there's a nice flat surface to load and haul on.

The largest drawback is the mileage.  Horrible.  Since I've gotten the Durango, I've averaged 12.8 miles per gallon.  I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I had no idea I'd be that close to single-digit mileage!  I understand that technically I'm still in the "break-in" period; but, it's an expensive period.

I have to admit, with the great financing incentives automakers are offering, I've begun to look for something that's a little more affordable to maintain.
