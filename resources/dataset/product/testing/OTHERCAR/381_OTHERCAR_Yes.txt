            Okay, okay, I'll admit it.  I originally looked at the Xterra because of the great advertising and the &quot;integrated first aid kit&quot;.  It was geared toward youth, and I definitely wanted to feel youthful.  I was afraid that the ride would be rough (like some trucks), but one test drive proved that wrong.  It rode better than my 4-door economy car that was in great shape.  I fell in love.  I refused to leave the lot without my new toy, and that was a year ago this month.  I still love it and recommend it to everyone.  Great ride; fun, sporty look; power options---the works.  This sport utility has it all and doesn't drain the pocket book.  I would advise opting for the V-6 though.  No point in a 4-cylinder really.  The only thing I don't like is that the gas light comes on at a quarter of a tank and I can drive for quite a while with that annoying light on.  All-in-all, great buy; great buying experience!<br><br>
