            Upon purchasing a used vehicle, I was in serious need of reliable transportation.  After my '69 BEETLE had been rear-ended &amp; completely totaled in an accident, I decided it was time to stop fooling around with older automobiles &amp; get something newer.  Besides, I'd spent hours of time on installing an engine on that old Bug so I was pretty much through with wasting anymore time on restoring it any further after the new engine had been trashed two weeks after installation.

Since I like Fords &amp; pretty much anything from Ford Motors Co., I stopped by my local dealer &amp; checked out their selection of used cars &amp; trucks.  I'd recently read about the Mercury Sable in an auto magazine &amp; it sounded good, looked good aannd it had the V6 engine with 200 horses.
It had only 22,000 miles on it, so I took it for a test drive &amp; came back with the price I was willing to pay the next evening.  They took me up on my offer, &amp; I rode the car home.

Now after driving the '96 Sable LS for over three years, I have taken notice of two humungous flaws: one, the suspension is way too damn low for a sedan of this type.  I bought this vehicle as means of transportation for work &amp; when I take my family out.  I did not intend on buying a lowrider where the rear end smacks against the pavement everytime a go over a slanted bump or over a curb.  I bought what is supposed to be a sedan.  Second, the front seats are very uncomfortable.  You can't sit down over an hour without your back starting to ache.  If you want to go on a cross-country trip, forget it.  Leaning back on these seats for that amount of time will have you calling your favorite chiropractor as soon as you come home from your trip.


What I DO like about the Sable is that the exterior styling is very unique &amp; as soon as you see the it you know right off the bat that yep, that's a Sable, alright.  You get very good gas mileage on this car, about 27-28 mpg.  The JBL premium system is definitely worth the extra couple hundred dollars.  With those eight speakers &amp; the 6 cd changer, you'll have a good time singing along with your favorite tunes on your way to work.  With the optional V6 &amp; automatic transmission, you'll have a nice driving experience.  The back seats are very roomy, even a big guy like me can sit in the back comfortably.  And unlike the front seats, they won't give you a back ache.

Overall, the (96) Sable gives you a reliable source of transportation (the engine still purrs like a kitten) but it will not give you a comfortable driving experience.  I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this set of wheels to anyone in which comfort is a major issue.  I'll assume that it is an issue to almost everyone, but if it doesn't bother you, fine.  As for the brand new redesigned 2000 Mercury Sable, I find the exterior styling boring &amp; unnecessary to stray that far away from it's current design.<br><br>
