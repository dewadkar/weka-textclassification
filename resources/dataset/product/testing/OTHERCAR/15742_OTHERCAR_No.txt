            New breed? Well, Chrysler made something similar few decades ago and as we all know it didn't sell well. But when you think about it maybe people back then had different needs and different standards. In today's auto world people want something versatile, something that they can take to work everyday and something that they can take to the mountains for the ski trip. But is it a truly an allroad vehicle? 

I bought one six months ago and here is what I have to say.

First time I saw this car it grabbed my immediate attention. As I looked closer I noticed great craftsmanship, very comfortable seats, roomy interior (I think it is really designed for four not five as Audi claims) but then you see a lot of parts and features that you can get in VW Passat 4motion for about twenty thousand less. Why did I buy it? 
I got brain washed just like it always happens when you get in to the hands of a good salesman. Do you really need that variable suspension?  I think not, at least not for that price. If you are buying a car for everyday commute and a ski trip VW Passat 4motion or any of the Subaru or Volvo models will be plenty and a lot more affordable. If you are buying something for off road use look elsewhere, audi allroad will not do the trick, I know it from my personal experience when I buried my allroad on the beach and non of the gadgets that Audi put in there helped. And the most embarrassing part was when some surfer pulled me out of there on his 1986 beat up Jeep Cherokee in the matter of minutes, that 's when I really felt ripped off but it was too late.

Reliability.

Out of six months of my ownership this car spent about month and a half in the shop. At first there were minor problems such as; xenon lights would not ignite properly, couple of loose screws, sunroof that exploded while I was driving on the freeway, bad wheel alignment, play in the hood. But then at around 5,000 miles one of the turbochargers started to make a weird noise, once again I took it to the dealer and every time they told me that problem was fixed, it would appear again. Finally on my fourth trip to the dealer and one week of inspection they  found a leak in the turbocharger. They said the whole engine needs to be pulled out so that they can replace turbochargers. Boy, oh boy was I upset. Fifty thousand dollar vehicle with five thousand miles needs a major engine repair! as I found out later, Audi had this ongoing problem since they started production of their 2.7T engine, which they claimed they fixed, apparently they didn't. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is when Sonnen Motors (Audi dealership) told me that they need to replace turbochargers. I called Audi USA and asked them to buy back my car and sell me a new one, as I expected they said no, they said they will fix it. So I called Sonnen Motors to schedule an appointment and to my surprise found out that they are refusing to do the job and to justify that, their service manager said that it is not a problem and they shouldn't fix it (I guess he did not like the idea of me calling Audi). I called back Audi USA next morning and filed a complaint, but to my surprise Audi took dealerships position and basically blew me off. Never in my life I've seen such a lousy service and especially from manufacturer claiming to be second best in the world. Eventually turbochargers and headers were replaced at another dealership and Audi did pay for it, but you would expect much better service for the money you're paying.
