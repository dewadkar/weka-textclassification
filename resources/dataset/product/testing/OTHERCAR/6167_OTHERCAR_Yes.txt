            I recently borrowed a chevy venture and was very surprised.It handled great and was very accessible to the passengers. I had a couple of passengers that were not very agile, and getting in  and out proved very comfortable to them and me also. I was pleased with the gas mileage and the accessories were nice also. 
I had driven other vans before but this one with the extra door that opens allowing passengers to get in from both sides was the most agreeable feature, I have witnessed. It had good power for pickup which was a surprise to me. I didn't realize it was so smooth in doing so. I did notice the tent was mild as compared to some, but that's something I could live with.<br><br>
