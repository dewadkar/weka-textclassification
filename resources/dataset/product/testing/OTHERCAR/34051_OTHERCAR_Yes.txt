            In 1996 I was trying to make more of my life by going to college.  I had to commute to North Adams State College in Massachusetts daily with a 1984 Jetta that I obtained free of charge because it NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION (and a WHOLE lot of other things as you can well imagine.)  This story need not go any further:  my attendance at school was going badly because of my darned car.  

I turned to the classifieds, only to find that I could pay $500 for a BAD used car.  Or I could pay $7,000 and up for a GOOD used car.  At that time there just seemed to be no middle ground.  I looked through Consumer Guides and other circulars to come up with a good NEW car.  I figured a couple of thousand more and I'd be better off.  It came down to a Cavalier or a Neon.  Both had good track records for &quot;cheapy new cars,&quot; with good gas mileage and comfort, etc.  

I test drove a couple of Neons and they truly won me over; I never drove a Cavalier.  The first one was okay, but it was a used one and its track record included having been a rent-a-car.  The second one was the one I currently own; a fire engine red two-door, manual transmission, and the only options are rear defrost and the radio.  Period.  Amen.  I cheaped out.  I've never owned an automatic transmission, by the way, so that was no big sacrifice.  

I still have the same car to this day and have had only one problem with it.  RIGHT after the warranty expired (how typical!) I shut my door and found the &quot;door ajar&quot; warning illuminated in my dashboard, and the overhead light was on as if the door was open, but it wasn't.  There was something wrong with the button in the door (the &quot;what-cha-ma-call-it button.&quot;)  and I ended up having to disconnect my dome light and having to deal with the &quot;door ajar&quot; light.  Through my own cheapness it is still disconnected to this day.  

Aside from that I enjoy great gas mileage and low maintenance.  Furthermore, I'm 5'10&quot; and need a lot of room---in fact I'm a &quot;push the seat all the way back&quot; kind of lady---so its interior is sheer heaven to me.  The back seat leaves much to be desired, but I'm rarely back there and hardly ever have more than three people in my car (including myself).  

I live in western Massachusetts, too, where the winters can be harsh at times.  It has never buckled under the subzero temperatures we sometimes experience, and it always, always, always!  handles well in the ice and snow.

Another drawback you may find is the location of the vent on the dashboard.  Two weeks after my sale was final I ran into an old friend of mine.  He was happy I had the car, but he told me about how he test drove  a Neon.  He went on to say he never bought one because the vent was right in the middle of the dashboard and it always reflected in the middle of the windshield and it sort of distracted him.  So what do you think I noticed each and every time I fired up the car?  You got it!  That darned vent!!!  Glaring at me right in the middle of my windshield.  But I adapted.  Obviously.     

I finally graduated top of my class (epinion will not allow me to type the Latin name as it is &quot;objectionable&quot; or whatever.  Isn't that an interesting side fact?) from college, and as my degree was in Creative Writing, it may come as no surprise to you that I'm still a waitress.  On my waitress salary, my car payments have really been no problem.  Neons are both affordable, (economical in terms of gas and maintenance,) and pleasurable to own.  I wouldn't trade mine for anything (except maybe a 2000 Neon!)  

Post Script (one year later):  I have just now acquired the title from  the bank and still have had no problems.  I replaced two of the tires, and aside from normal maintenence, it has cost me very little to own this car.  After more than four years, I am still perfectly content with my Neon!  <br><br>
