            Most people wonder why/how the Canon PowerShot SD100 is preferable to the Canon PowerShot S230, since both cameras are so similar in terms of functionality.  This review will discuss the notable difference between the two cameras and explain why you should opt for the SD100, which is THE PERFECT CAMERA on the market today.

<b>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SD100 & THE S230</b>

<b>1. SIZE & WEIGHT.</b> The SD100 is smaller than the S230 (same height, but 1/4" less in width and 1/8" less in thickness). It also weighs 1/2 an ounce less (6.35 oz. vs. 5.82 oz.). These may not look like much, but it is noticeable in your pocket.

<b>2. MEDIA.</b> The SD100 uses the SecureDigital (SD) card whereas the S230 uses the CompactFlash (CF) card. The SD card is smaller in size (1/2 the width and 1/2 the thickness), about the size of a postage stamp. While the CF card is still more popular than the SD card, the SD card is quickly gaining popularity due to the smaller form factor. I bought a SanDisk 256MB SD card with a SD card reader for $60 from Amazon during a recent sale.

<b>3. AUDIO.</b> The SD100 has a speaker on the camera whereas the S230 does not. The speaker on the SD100 allows for different sound effects for different functions while the S230 merely beeps. For example, you can set the shutter sound so that when you take a picture, the speaker lets out a sound (one of the options is to make the sound just like a film camera's shutter). You can also get different sounds for self-timer. But BEST OF ALL, you can do movie playback and get sound from the camera (the S230 also captures audio in movie mode, audio playback is limited to the computer/TV only, not on the camera). You are also able to attach voice memos to each picture only on the SD100. The volume is adjustable for each of the functions.

<b>4. MANUAL MODE.</b> On the S230, to switch from Auto to Manual in camera mode, you had to click on Set -&gt; Switch from Auto to Manual -&gt; Set again. On the SD100, switching to Manual is a simple twist of a knob. This is much, much better because there are a few things that require you to be in Manual mode: white balance, infinity focus, continuous shooting, photo effect (vivid, neutral, low sharpening, sepia, b&w), ISO control, metering control, etc.

<b>5. EXTERNAL FINISH.</b> The S230 has an off-silver exterior finish (not quite a champagne color but it has a slight champagne tint). The SD100 has a brilliant silver finish. If you put the two side by side, then the S230 looks really champagne color. I suppose this is strictly personal preference, but I much prefer the more brilliant silver color of the SD100.

<b>BOTH CAMERAS ARE GREAT BECAUSE ...</b>
Both the SD100 and the S230 are small cameras, and they take excellent pictures. 3 megapixels is plenty for printing up to 8x10 pictures. The 640x480 movie mode provides very sharp videos (the S400 and many other cameras only have 320x240 which really isn't worth much). The buttons and the menu on the camera are very intuitive; even the first time digital camera users will be able to learn all the functions in just few minutes.

<b>BOTH CAMERAS CAN IMPROVE ON ...</b>
The flash. Being such small cameras, the flash is on the weak side (still better than most cameras that are this small). The flash will be a problem only if you take lots of pictures in total darkness or with very little light. The battery life isn't the best either. Canon rates this camera to take 180 pictures with the LCD on and the flash used on 45 of those. Given the tiny size of the battery and the camera, those are great numbers. Regardless of how great/awful the battery life is, you should still get a second battery (batterybarn.com sells one for $30; the battery number for the SD100 is NB-3L). I took a trip to the Zion National Park in Utah for a weekend in August 2003 and took a 256MB SD Card and two batteries.  I took 200+ pictures and filled the 256MB card before I ran out of power in both batteries.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
The differences in the two cameras was enough for me to spend an extra $50 to buy the SD100 instead of the S230. As far as portable point-and-shoot digital cameras go, the SD100 is THE PERFECT CAMERA. It has everything one needs.
