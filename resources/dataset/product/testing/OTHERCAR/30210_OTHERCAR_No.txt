            When I bought this truck, I expected it to be one of the best investment of my life. I was wrong, the first flaw that I noticed was that the drive wasn't at all smooth, in fact when I went over a speed bump one, it shook so much, my daughter started crying. I tried to tow my boat, but the hitch cables weren't working. The back seats also were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. 

On a positive note however, the radio sounded good and the Compact disc player worked great. Also it has a smooth sleek body and it can carry a lot of weight. 

I suggest you take a long test drive or get a lemon check, because I don't want anyone to have to go through the trouble that I did. <br><br>
