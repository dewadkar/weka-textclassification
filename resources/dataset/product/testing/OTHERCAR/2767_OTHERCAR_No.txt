            I bought my 1997 vw jetta two years ago, I purchased it as a used car, however the miles were low and it was very sporty looking.  I have the gls version so it has electric windows and locks and a power sunroof along with a tape player.
After only having the car for a few weeks I needed new brakes, following that new window wipers and then my transmission began to fail, although my problems with the car were typically minor the ride is a very rough one.  I continue to get a check engine light but yet no one can find anything wrong and I could probably fill a semi with the amount of gas it takes. 
The trunk space is very large but the cargo area is slightly on the small side.  The neat feature but not so practical feature is when unlocking the door you can also roll down the windows at the same time.  I can honestly say that I have never felt the need to stand there and roll down the windows from the outside when you can just get in the car and roll them down.
Overall the car is cute to look at but I am certain that I would never buy another one.  That is if I could ever sell this one because the book value has dropped drastically.<br><br>
