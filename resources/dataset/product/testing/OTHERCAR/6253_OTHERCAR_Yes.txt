            When I bought my first Nissan pickup in 1989, I was looking for basic transportation I could drive until the wheels fell off.  After 10 years and 130,000 miles, I ultimately came to the conclusion that nothing was going to kill this thing.  During that time, my only trip to the repair shop was to fix the air conditioning.  So when I needed something a little bigger, I couldn't rationally choose anything but another Nissan.  Fortunately, the Frontier Crew Cab had just hit the market.  After nearly a year of ownership, I'm happy to say the high quality and reliability of my '89 hasn't changed in my Frontier.  Smooth running, no oil usage, no mechanical problems to date.  The standard 3.3 liter V6 could be a little zippier, although it has plenty of torque in the low end.  Also, the cheap General tires are unworthy of the truck's tight suspension and cornering capabilities.  Buy it, buy it, buy it!<br><br>
