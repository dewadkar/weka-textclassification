            I don't own an FD-71, but I use one extensively at work.  I've never read the manual (don't know where it is) but I've been able to use every feature on the camera... it's that intuitive.  Overall, the camera is very easy to use, the battery seems to last for quite a long time even with the LCD screen running, and the resolution is okay... not the greatest, but okay for archival purposes.

Like other Sony Mavica digital cameras, the FD-71 uses a standard 1.4M floppy disk for 'film'.  You really can't beat the ease-of-use and compatibility that this provides.  Most of the features are menu driven and controlled by a nice little directional pad on the back of the camera.  The FD-71 does not have an optical viewfinder, which can seem strange at first.  Pictures are always composed using the backlit LCD screen.

For some reason, pictures always seem crisper on the LCD screen than they actually do once they are written to disk.  The resolution of the FD-71 is not professional quality on the normal setting (where you can put about 20+ pictures onto a disk).  There is a high quality setting, but this limits you to a single picture per disk.  

The focusing and zoom range of the FD-71 is astounding.  It can photograph objects in sharp focus about as close as one or two centimeters.  I have also found that indoor photos almost always require a flash in order to get a good picture.

Overall the FD-71 is probably a good choice for a company that needs to take pictures or products or other items that will be published on the web.  For web publication, the resolution of the FD-71 is more than adequate.  The FD-71 would also be a good choice for a home user that wants to take lots of photos and exchange them with friends via email or disk.<br><br>
