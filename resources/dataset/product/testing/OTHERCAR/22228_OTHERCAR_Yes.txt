            So, epinions is willing to pay me about $0.25 for telling you the inside story on the Z3.   OK, why not? Internally known as the &quot;e-36/7&quot; the Z-3 was the 7th iteration on the e-36 (pre 1999 3 series) cars.

You want to know about crash?  This is interesting: I saw one get dropped from about 8 feet, upside down, onto a cement floor.  The dummies inside suffered *no* head injuries and the windshield didn't even crack.  The violent rollover test was about the same: no injuries.

One interior conflict concerned the front bumpers.  BMW research has shown that most head-on crashes are offset: either the left or right side of your vehicle will strike an obstacle, but seldom will your vehicle actually plow head-on into an immovable object.  However, according to US crash tests, you have to ram into a wall at 90 degrees.  The problem is, that if you can easily pass the US tests, you have increased difficulty passing the real-world (offset) crashes.

About 24 of the million dollar + pre-production cars were killed to satisfy internal BMW goals of getting a gold star on the silly US tests while still passing the more rigid internal BMW standards.

The interior is too small for my frame, but the handling is sublime.  At first offered with the sorry 1.8 liter, now the minimum is the 170 hp 2.5 liter.  Fuel economy is good, reliability is good.  Slight wind noise after many miles and at high speeds.  The cabin is decent, but not overwhelmingly good.  Don't use a Z-3 as a primary driver unless you must.

The Z-3 is a great 4th car.  If you use it every day, it'll lose a bit of magic, but as an periodic driver, you will delight in its size, poise and responsiveness.  Only buy a model year 2000, because you get the better looking rear end, the wider track, improved headliner, cabin trim and motor selection.

Most people would probably be better off in a VW or Audi, but if you can use a great accessory car, the 2.8 Z3 is your partner.<br><br>
