            I needed to find a solution for a camera.  Traditional cameras were really expensive when you added in the film and developing costs.  We decided that a digital camera was in our future.  One thing that I didn't care for in digital cameras was this special cable that you had to use to connect it to your PC.  This wasn't really a convenient thing because you had to have this cable and special software to download the pictures into a computer.  In comes the Sony Mavica MVC-FD71!  It has no special cable.  You put floppy disks right into the camera!  This is the greatest film you could ever want!  Having the camera use floppy disks means this: 1) No need to buy extra memory cards, 2) When your camera fills up with pictures you just change the floppy disk, 3) The floppy disks fit into any PC or Mac.  This is a really great camera because you can just take a few floppy disks along with you and you can take a TON of pictures and not have to worry about wasting money.  Another very cool thing about this camera is that it has a little screen on back that you can view the pictures that you have taken, and lets you preview the picture that you are about to take.  Another thing that I was very impressed with was the battery.  Usually the batteries that come standard with things like this are pretty weak and you usually need to buy an upgraded battery to get any decent amount of time out of them.  The standard battery that comes with this camera lasts a long time!  I was pretty shocked!  We have never been out and had the battery become an issue with us.  When its charged up, it will last a whole weekend with normal camera usage.  I took it on a ski trip and took quite a few pictures and battery power never even got close to running out.  This camera also has some cool features that will allow you to take pictures in black &amp; white, sepia, solarize, and another one that I can't think of.  The black &amp; white and sepia settings are really nice to take serious pictures of people..  I have taken some pictures of some barns in the sepia mode and they came out really cool looking.  This camera takes pictures in 640x480 resolution.  I would recommend this camera for anyone that wants to have a digital camera for family use.  Its a great tool and I wouldn't trade it for another camera!
