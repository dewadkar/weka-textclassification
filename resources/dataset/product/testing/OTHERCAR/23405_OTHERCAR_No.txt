            <b>Throwing a needle in the haystack</b>

I normally don't like to add my epinion when a product already has a long list of reviews, but every now and then I feel that I must make an exception.  In all 43 epinions of the Intrigue, I found none that address the concerns that I have with this car.  So strong was my experience of the Intrigue that I find it necessary to cast an epinion into the crowd.

<b>Too much too much</b>

I rented an Oldsmobile Intrigue last week to get around the city of Chicago during a business trip.  In my travels, I had to drive on city streets, in the suburbs and out on the highways.  In none of these conditions did I feel safe driving the Intrigue.

In short, the Intrigue is simply too much.  I'm not a small man, but I'm no Andre the Giant either.  I felt like a dwarf in the Intrigue.  My legs were not comfortable on the pedals, and all I could find to adjust the driver's seat was a switch that rocked the chair back and forth.  A neat toy, but not one I need in a car.  Give me the old under-the-seat handle to slide forward and day.

The small feeling I got climbing into the Intrigue continued when I turned the key and drove out of the parking lot.  The engine anticipated me, moving the car forward too fast and too powerfully without me even stepping on the gas.  The weight of the car propelled me quickly down a slight incline so that I had to use my brakes just to maintain a safe speed.  Going up a hill, however, the weight of the Intrigue slowed me down so that I had little power.

Maneuvering in the Intrigue makes one feel like a pachyderm on a roller-skating rink.  The trunk stuck far out into traffic when I tried to back out of a parking spot.  At stop signs and red lights, I had to hold myself back so that the Intrigue's long hood didn't extend into the stream of traffic.  The resulting poor visibility sometimes made it necessary for me to make and educated guess as to whether a car was coming or not.

Worst, of all, the momentum of the weighty Intrigue out on the highway made driving the car a bore.  Frankly, the Intrigue is too smooth.  There's nothing to do on a four lane with this car except to force one's eyes to stay open.  The lack of interactivity required by the Intrigue makes it a dangerous car for long journeys.  I'd rather have something that reminds me that what I'm doing requires attention.

<b>In sum...</b>

The Oldsmobile Intrigue is anything but intriguing.  Rather, it is sedate and overweight, an old-fashioned barge that's too big for the modern driver.  The Intrigue is the valium of the road.<br><br>
