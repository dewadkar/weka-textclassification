            My Toyota was bought back in '94. It had 3 miles on it, so it was new.I traveled for a year back and forth from Atlanta to Columbus Ga. That's over 240miles a day. Now, in 2000, the truck has 150,000 miles on it, and the only thing I've changed on it is the brake pads and a fan belt. I'm now changing my clutch, but that's only because I've towed another car for about 2 hours riding my clutch. We've never taken the truck to the shop, for problems. The engine always starts, no troubles. I try to change the oil every 2500 miles instead of 3000 because afterall, oil is the blood of the engine. Many people have told me, that the transmition (5 speed) on this truck will last longer than the engine ever will, so you should not have problems with the transmition as long as you don't grind the gears every day. This pick-up truck handles great and it's got great pick-up in every gear.<br><br>
