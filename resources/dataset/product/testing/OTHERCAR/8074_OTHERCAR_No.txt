            Hummers are military vehicles and so they are very good on the off road. They shouldn't be driven on the streets. It is fun to look at when you see them at car shows, but I would never purchase one. They burn gas like an airplane, the shocks are so hard that every bump feels like a baseball bat to the head, they have EXTREMELY poor acceleration, and they are geared so high that the top speed is only like 78mph. All these characteristics are tolerable and accepted on the off road, but it is absolutely absurd for a normal person (not rich and not a superstar) to drive one on the road.
