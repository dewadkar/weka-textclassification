            My prime motivation for buying the 2000 Maxima GLE was the 2-door soul, 4 door body philosophy that this vehicle exudes. After analyzing the generic mid-size sedans, the enthusiast in me did not agree to buy a V6 version of these generic sedans since they lacked the sporty 'soul' essence. The 2000 Maxima boasts of horsepower improvements and refinements from its predecessor and makes it stand out in the sea of vanilla flavored sedans.

It's been three months since I purchased my GLE from Acme Nissan in South Brunswick, NJ and I just love this car! The dealership is nice, I had a pleasant car buying experience and to top it all I got a good deal :-)

My wife and I are extremely happy with the car and I find myself volunteering to run errands and chores for the household, just so that I enjoy the driving experience. I found the GLE to be extremely smooth and has a firm but cushioned ride. The best part about the car is that the power comes on seamlessly and relentlessly, its there when you need it the most, not a whimper, not a complaint, just steadfast and consistent in delivering torque. The steering is not over-assisted and helps the driver feel the road, sometimes it appears as if the steering has vision and the driver just needs to point the vehicle in the direction it has to go and the machine willingly follows. This eliminates the need for giving steering feedback/correction and is valuable asset at high speeds thereby fostering greater driver confidence when it comes to maneuvering tricky and fast corners or narrow construction lanes.

The controls in the car are fairly simple and there aren't too many buttons to confuse you. I personally like the sweeping center console, just what I was looking for. The Bose stereo system is awesome though I'd have liked a graphic equalizer for greater frequency control than just the bass and treble controls. The car is exceptionally quiet for a 3.0 liter V6 churning out 222 horses, the cabin is super quiet and the ride is plush which makes it even better to enjoy the high-fidelity music system. Imagine yourself in the driver's seat with the moonroof open on a starry night :-)

Enough of the accolades, now for the slight disappointments. First, I feel that the leather package is overpriced. My discerning eyes inspected the upholstery closely, while applying a leather conditioning cream, and I observed that the 'real leather' has been very 'judiciously' and 'carefully' used! Most of the upholstery is draped in 'faux leather' and only the 'seating surfaces' and by that I mean, the 'bare minimum' is covered in true, soft, supple Seton leather. I'm not sure if the other manufacturers drape their leather seats similarly, but I feel that Nissan is overcharging the consumer for the small patches of real leather. The quality of the materials is very good though, but over a $1000 for that amount of leather is a tad unsettling. I also feel that storage space inside is at a premium, especially in the rear. I'd also have appreciated Daytime running lights. The texture of the materials and buttons on the stereo and climate control are oddly different from one another and don't convey a uniform look and feel. The mode selection buttons on the climate control panel seem to be of a poorer quality than the other buttons. The windshield washer isnt effective and the washer fluid just trickles out unlike a jet spray. I'd have liked Liquid Crystal Displays(LCDs) to be used for the clock, Audio and Climate displays instead of the green LEDs.

At the end of the day, this is a lovely car worth treasuring and fun to drive. It is very dependable, safe and a joy to drive. As Nissan used to say .. &quot;Life is a journey, enjoy the drive&quot; ... Drive the 2000 Nissan Maxima and you'll know ..........

Cheers,
