            Our first digital camera is the Agfa 780.  We sell on ebay and got sick of taking pictures with a 35mm buying film, getting it devolped, scanning the pictures them throwing the pictures away.  So we started shopping for a camera.  WE ran across Agfa's 780.  We fell in love with it.  This camera has everything a beginer needs. 2MB removable memory card , 3 resolutoin settings, a timer, a LCD screen so that you can view your pictures as you are taking them, red eye pre-flash, uses 4 AA batteries, no need to buy expensive camera batteries, optional AC adapter. and many other setting and such.



The LCD to us is one of the best features. It allows us to view the pictures we have taken and if we do not like the way it turned out to deleat it then rather than wait till we downlaod it on to our computer. 


The 2MB removable memory card is also a great feature.  It give you opportunity to upgrade to a bigger card that will hold more pictures.  Perfect for vacations and family get togethers.  


We love our camera.  It is a great deal for our money, and it is perfect for takeing pictures for any occasion.  It is also VERY sipmle to use for anyone.


Thanks
Jennifer
