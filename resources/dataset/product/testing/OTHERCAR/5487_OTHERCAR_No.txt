<TEXT>
            We bought a Prizm because we needed an affordable ride to work and we needed it right then.  It has been a good car.  It gets us to work.  Other than that, though don't expect much.  

Comfort:  Terrible
The seats are hard and uncomfortable, not to mention cramped. 

The Drive:
Its acceleration is slow and laborious.  Better than the Toyota Tercel, but not by much.  Getting onto highways can be dangerous.  Lots of road noise.

Dependability:
Good dependability.  

Summary: 
The Prizm is a good vehicle, but not exciting.  I would not choose this to be my primary vehicle, but it is OK for short trips and will get you there.
