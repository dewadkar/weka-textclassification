            I wanted a truck but I wanted something small enough to get into a regular parking space. I suppose I should have assumed that a small truck inevitably means a light truck. I purchased a base model 4 wheel drive. The 4WD was excellent in the snow and the gas mileage was also pretty decent for a truck. The main problems I had were the room in the cab and the hauling capacity. I discovered very quickly that these trucks are not built for anyone over 5'10 to drive as the cab was not big enough to get the seat back far enough to not be cramped. The bench seat is designed for 2 people and only 2 people. Adding a 3rd person makes shifting impossible. This is not a problem I had with other mid-size to full size trucks. I also discovered the &quot;light&quot; nature of the truck when I tried to haul lumber. Nothing irritated me more than having to make 2 trips because even though all the lumber would have easily fit, the truck was resting on the axels and couldn't take the weight. I love Toyotas and would buy a toyota again, just in the regular truck size. Not the mini version.<br><br>
