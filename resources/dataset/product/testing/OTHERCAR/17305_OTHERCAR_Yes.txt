            I have for the last 10 years driven used Volvos.  When the time came to buy a new car, I decided to check out Chevy's because I drive a Corsica as a company car and love it.

I am glad I did.  We picked the Malibu because it was the "replacement" model for the Corsica and had a standard V-6 engine.  If anything, I was skeptical about buying an American car after having such wonderful experiences with Volvos and terrible past experiences with another GM car.  The Malibu has won me over easily!

The controls are wonderfully laid out, the heater is more than adequate for our Northeastern US winters, the ride is an absolute dream, the MPG is great for a V-6, it handles better than ANY car I've ever driven and I couldn't recommend it more highly for comfort for both large and small people.

Many of the reviews I've read which deride this model either cite issues I haven't encountered or blow out of proportion minor things that really don't impact the performance of this car or necessarily indicate future problems in my opinion.  Like me, I think many people went in to buying this car expecting problems.  I think I've just been a little more open minded in my analysis.
