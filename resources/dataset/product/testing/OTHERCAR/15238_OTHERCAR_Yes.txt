            Acura did the right thing by only offering this car with a manual transmission, you can really only appreciate an engine this incredible if you row through the gears yourself.  This also has the effect of making sure buyers of this car are serious drivers, not just people looking for a way to get around.  It's a wolf in sheep's clothing, a tiger waiting in the tall grass to pounce; all the cliches apply.  Though I was a little disappointed not to feel the V-TEC &quot;kick-in&quot; as some auto reviewers had claimed it does (the engine shifts to a different cam profile at 4400 RPM and then to a secondary intake tract at 5600 RPM)the effect is nevertheless powerful acceleration that only gets stronger as the Rev's increase, albeit you need to get the engine spinning pretty fast before it really starts to show off.  Combine with this mechanical magic Acura's (Honda's) sterling reputation for longevity, and you have a winner by any measure.  Just dump those factory-equipped Michelin XGT tires at the first chance you get, they are seriously dangerous in the wet!  <br><br>
