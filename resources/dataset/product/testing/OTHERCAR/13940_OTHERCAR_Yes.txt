            My only complaint about my Outback is the placement of the cup holders. If you have any drinks in the cup holders its tough to get at the climate controls and the radio. But that's it. I never understood how so many people could get so fanatical about a car until I bought one. The car handles amazingly well both on and off (yes it can go off road) the road. It has plenty of space for four people and all of their stuff. the gas mileage is great and I've had it for almost two years without a single maintenance problem. It struggles when going up hills with four folks and luggage but it makes it. When there are only one or two people in the car it's exceptionally quick. 
If you are a dog owner make sure you make the dealer throw in a dog gate as part of the deal or you'll have a hard time finding one. They're quite pricey too.  I sprung it on my dealer right before I was ready to sign the papers and he couldn't refuse.  I'm leasing the car right now and I'm still very happy with the purchase so I'll probably buy it when the lease is up. 
I've recommended the Outback to several friends and those that have purchased one have all been happy with it. Good luck in your new car search!<br><br>
