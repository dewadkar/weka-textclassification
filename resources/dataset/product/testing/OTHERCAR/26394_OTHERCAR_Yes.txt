            Meeting your family work or leisure needs, convenience, power and performance are probably important factors in your decision to purchase a truck.  After having a chance to test-drive this 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD Ext Cab, I know that I have found the right truck for me.  I have been making plans to get one even though my Jeep is still working fine.  To get my wife on my side, I have invited her to accompany me in my second test-drive.  My children came with us and fell in love with all the space and features that this truck comes equipped with.  

If I wanted to buy a truck right now, this 2002 Chevrolet Silverado would be it.  There is no doubt on my part. I would be joining thousands of truck enthusiasts who have made the Chevrolet Silverado a true American icon.  There is no doubt either that the Silverado has continued the Chevy tradition of long-lasting, sturdy vehicles.  That's all we need as consumers.  We need a product we can feel proud of, a product that won't break down soon and cost us so much money to repair it.  Chevrolet Silverado gives us a pick up for our hauling and heavy-duty needs.

<b>First let's look at some of the competitors of this truck</b>

While General Motors can go unchallenged for a long time by the competition, they are willing to take this pick up and try to come up with a much refined and better vehicle as the years go by.  It was in mid-2001 when the Silverado 1500 HD combines the best qualities of Chevrolet's popular half-ton pickup with the hauling power, the strength of its three-quarter-ton model frame.  When they added the convenience of the crew cab model, they came up with a product that can compete with anything on the market right now.  The 2002 Chevrolet Silverado comes in four models.  With so much power, at work, this truck can beat any of its competitors.  They are 2002 For F250 Superduty SuperCab, 2002 Sierra C2500 HD Extended Cab and 2001 Dodge RAm 2500 Truck.  Depending on the model you buy, you will find out that it is packaged differently.  After test-driving the SLE, I looked at the base model to find less options.  The more options you want, the more you will pay.  

<b>Some of the eye-catching and under-the-hood features</b>

The 2002 Chevy Silverado is in a class on its own in terms of its Vortec gasoline engine.  Depending on the model you pick, it can range from 4300 V6, 4800 V8, 5300 V8 and 6000 V8 with 200 to 200 hp.  It comes with all the features that any of its competitors are equipped with.  I can remember sitting behind the steering wheel with a lot of ease.  The leather seats were very comfortable.  Among the safety and security features, you will find the truck's antilock brakes, child restraint, the PASSLock II theft-deterrent system and steel side-door beams.  Also, you will appreciate that dual air bag (driver and passenger sides)which can be deactivated with the switch of a button.  For xample, on the LT model, you can find the OnStar system.  It's standard on it.  If you end up being stuck in the boondocks, out of nowhere, this system will be of great help to you in terms of automatic location.  

If you want to do some off-road driving, this truck will accommodate your needs too.  With gas-charged shock absorbers, off-road jounce bumpers, specific stabilizer bars, a skid plate package and other interesting features, the Silverado is ready to fill you with joy and satisfaction.

I would highly recommend it to anybody.
