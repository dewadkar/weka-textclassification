            I purchased this camera though AOL, swayed by the low price. My intention was to be able to easily upload pictures to eBay for auction sales.  The ease of use and unloading of the images to my PC is a snap, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the image. The pixel density is so low that fine details are impossible to discern when viewing from an eBay page.  Cost per pixel is an obvious consideration.  Better resolution costs more. Also, battery life is so limited, that by the time I unload the images, they (the batteries) have to be replaced. I would recommend a power adapter and not use batteries at all. As for my plans for a digital camera, I'll look for something better.
