            I bought the 2000 Volvo V40 as a demo in January of 2001.

With a baby on the way, I needed something with a little more space than my Japanese sedan.

Wanting a Wagon and after looking at the Subaru's and the Saturn's, I found the Volvo's fell into a similar price category.  

I was stunned...  A Volvo...

The test drive was uneventful.. not blown away, but it's a Volvo...  So we bought it...  Fully loaded and good to go.

After driving it for a year, I have zero complaints about the V40 mechanically, from a comfort point of view, or anything else...  I love it...  My Volvo dealer and service dept. have been great.

The issues are, trunk space - I found that once you have the baby carriage in the trunk, there is little room for much else...  especially if you have a big carriage.

Also, if you have multiple kids, they are packed in tight...  They are very comfortable, but tight.

Another issue is Volvo envy...

I am a Volvo owner and very happy...  But now I notice all the bigger, pretty Volvo's on the road.  I never see my V40 in commercials, ads, or in Movie's...  

Boo Hoo.....

I still love my V40 and highly recommend it.
