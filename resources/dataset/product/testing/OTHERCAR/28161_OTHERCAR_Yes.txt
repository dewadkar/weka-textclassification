            Go out, look at all the models available in this range, as a matter of fact look at higher priced models. I dare you to find a better overall value for quality and features than the Fuji s602Z. The best price/value around. No camera is perfect; they all have their pros and cons but look at all the pros and the few cons on this one and you will be sold. I know this sounds like an advertisement but the s602z is just that good. 

One of the fastest cameras you will ever find. The closest thing to an SLR without the size, weight and cost. 

The features are endless, just look at the list below for a few. Besides those, it just takes great pictures with no effort and fantastic pictures with a little effort. Look around the many Fuji Forums like the one at dpreview.com and you can find thousands of sample pics that show the quality this camera can give. It also just feels good in your hand; menu system and dual-function buttons (using a shift button) give you good quick control to most of the features. 

Try it; You'll like it. The value is incredible. 

Some of the feature that was important in my decision to buy it was: 

6x Zoom 

15sec to 1/10,000 sec shutter speeds 

5FPS mode 

Last 5Frames mode 

40 pic motor drive 

Auto Bracketing 

Shooting Priority Modes; Aperture, Shutter, Sports, Landscape, Portrait, Night, B&W, Full Manual or Full Auto 

Shift button menu functions 

Manual Focus with quick focus button 

Both Smartmedia and CF/Microdrive Memory Slots 

Uses 4 AA batteries (I use NiMH rechargeable) 

View last picture before saving incl. multiple frame modes 

Histogram view before saving 

640x480 30FPS Movie mode with sound (Can fill memory) 

VERY short lag time from shot to shot. 

You can add filters, Wide/Tele lenses 

The list just goes on and on. And on top of it all, great quality pictures with up to 6MP resolution (it is an interpolated 6MP but comparable to at least 4MP on other cameras) and has gorgeous printed pictures. 

Buy this camera and you will not be sorry... I'm not :)
