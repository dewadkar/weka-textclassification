            My husband and I bought our Mazda in '95 as a program car.  It had 8,000 miles on it.  We were expecting our first child and needed a four door car.  It worked out o.k. for that but when you put a rear facing infant seat in the back it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the seat in front of it.  Also, be prepared to use seat belt locks in order to install your child seats properly (not an easy task).  We've had one more child since we bought it and it's held up rather well (the interior) considering the abuse.  My biggest complaint is that the brackets holding the driver's seat (and passenger seat) in place are made of cheap metal and one has broken making my driver's seat a rocking chair.  This can't be a good thing to have during an accident but I can't afford to fix this now.  In order to fix it you have to replace the entire seat.  Of course this happened after our extended 100,000 mile warranty ran out.  Mechanically this has been a reliable car.  I believe there was a recall for CV joints (?) and we had those fixed as well as a recall for some electrical glitch involving headlights going off when you use your blinkers.  We had this fixed before the recall (it's not fun having your headlights turn off whenever you signal a right hand turn!!) so we're still trying to get reimbursed from Mazda.  No other mechanical problems other than a broken alternator belt.  By the way...if you like to repair your own car this car (as most Japanese cars) is difficult.  To fix the alternator belt you have to remove the timing belt and hope that your hands are small enough to get in there.  I'm not a mechanic by any means but I had to help my husband do this because his hands were too big.  Other people have mentioned the cup holder problem...it's too close to the radio which has resulted in my radio buttons hopelessly sticking due to coca-cola buildup.  With all those complaints aside I have enjoyed my Protege and would recommend it despite these small glitches.  It would make a great first car or just a back-up car for a family.  If we have another child we'll have to get a bigger car but, since we believe in driving a car until it's death, for now it's our four person family vehicle.  Oh...just one more glitch.  Mazda makes horrible keys (I have heard this from several people) so if you get a Mazda go out and have new keys made because if you don't you'll probably end up with a broken key in you door (like I have).
