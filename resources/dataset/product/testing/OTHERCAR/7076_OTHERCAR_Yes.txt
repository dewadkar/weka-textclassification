             I've had this camera for a few weeks now and am very pleased with it. I was a little hesitant at first because of mixed reviews about picture quality. I've printed some 8"x10"'s and they are beautiful! Other cameras I've had or used include the Sony dsc-P1 (3.3meg), Sony dsc-F55 (2.1 meg) and the Canon s100 (2.1 meg). I find the photo quality with the Fuji 4700 on par with the P1 and somewhat better than the dsc-F55 and way ahead of the Canon s100.
 The batteries seem to last about as long as the other cameras but they are cheap enough that I can carry spares.
 This camera is ready to take pictures in just a few seconds-very fast!
 It's small enough to take with me all the time too.
 I picked mine up for $469 and with the release of the 4800 I wouldn't be surprised to see prices fall further before it is discontinued. One advantage it will have over the 4800 is the batteries (the new 4800 will be not be using AA)
