            My mom owns the 1995 Hyundai Elantra 2 door. She bought this vehicle when her previous car broke down. She bought it mainly because of price.Shortly after buying it we found that it was definately not worth the price. One week after buying it she had to purchase a whole new battery for the car. Since then she has had to have numerous repairs done on it.Two of her power windows will not go up or down. Her power door locks no longer function properly. Her radio quit working. She has had to replace the brakes twice. She has had to replace 2 wheel bearings on it. The transmission is now staring to malfunction. And all of this in ONLY 1 YEAR OF OWNING THE CAR.She has been told that parts for the car are extremely hard to find. Most will have to ordered from the dealer which will up the price on them.This car is definately not worth your time or money in shopping for it. The lesson learned it research before you buy!<br><br>
