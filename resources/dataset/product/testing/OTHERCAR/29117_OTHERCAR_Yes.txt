            This is the first truck I've ever owned, and I would be hard pressed to buy anything excpet a Toyota in the future. They know how to make great trucks!
I went from a 97 Acura Integra GSR to my 99 Tacoma TRD V6 extended cab 4x4. I wanted something more practical, something that wasn't a target for thieves, and something that i could take to the snow and not have to put chains on.
I got it in November of 99 for 5% over invoice and have put 51000 miles on it. I have had NO problems with the truck at all, excpet for one burned-out taillight, which was replaced under warranty. It has been the picture of reliability.
I had to have two of the stock Goodyear Wrangler GSA tires replaced because they developed flatspots. This was kind of a hassle. I had to go back and forth between the Goodyear dealership and the Toyota dealership several times before the tires got replaced. BTW, the GSAs are TERRIBLE tires. I mean the worst. I replaced them at 20000 miles with some Michelin LTX ATs and am much happier. The Michelins are great tires.
The truck does very well in mud, snow, anything. I've never gotten it stuck. It goes anywhere, hauls anything, and is very comfortable.
There are only a couple of complaints I have:

1.  The stock tires SUCK.
2.  The V6 pings pretty badly under load. I always run 87 octane because it's cheaper and I drive a lot. The knock sensor kicks in pretty quickly and retard the timing to calm the pinging after a few seconds, but romp on it in 5th gear with the a/c on and get ready for some engine noise! The guy at the dealership I go to said his does the same thing. Not really a big deal, but it sounds bad.
3.  The rear end can get pretty loose when not weighted down. the TRD suspension is pretty firm, and the rear tires will have a hard time getting traction (lots of axle hop) without a couple hundred pounds in the bed. When there is a load in the bed, the truck rides GREAT. I've carried two motorcycles (900 lbs. total) in the truck and it was a piece of cake.

These are great trucks. If you are considering a compact truck get a Tacoma. You will be very happy.<br><br>
