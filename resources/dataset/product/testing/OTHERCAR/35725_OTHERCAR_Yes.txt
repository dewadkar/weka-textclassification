            there is so much room in the back seats that you could fit almost anything in there.  this is one of the best cars.  it has a V8 engine which pulls like a V12.  it is nice and big but not too big to look like a cadillac.  the trunk has so much room that i do not know what to do with it.  there are so many features on the BMW 7 series.  like special tinted windows that are shatter proof and are sensitive to rain so that if the rain gets harder the windshield wipers move faster.  the seats are warmed, there is a sunroof and optional moonroof.  the sound system in it is great.  it is produced by Harmon Kardon and contains about seven to ten speakers throughout the car.  there are airbags on both sides of the car, one on each side of each passenger and on the driver.  there is head airbags in the front for the front passenger and driver.  these are all standard.  the car never needs maintenace because it runs so smoothly.  it is plainly terrific.<br><br>
