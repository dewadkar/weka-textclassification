            When shopping for cars recently, my husband and I ventured upon many a car lot.  We found a few we liked, but weren't sure what would be the best investment of our money.  It was his idea to check out this &quot;certified, pre-owned Lexus&quot; deal, and I wasn't to keen on it.  But needless to say, I'm glad he convinced me to get my SC 400.  The idea of certifying their pre-owned cars is a stroke of Lexus genius.  Were it not for the 3 year and 100, 000 mile warranty, I never would have looked at a  used car.  Thank goodness I did.  I now own a GORGEOUS red luxury sports coupe - complete with chrome wheels, sunroof, spoiler, and window tinting - not to mention all the included luxuries a Lexus affords. Should my car break down, I have 24 hour roadside assistance.  I also have the luxury of a loaner Lexus anytime my car should need to be in the shop (which I seriously doubt will ever even happen).  The car has lifetime unlimited car washes at the dealership, and I am as happy as a clam.   My SC 400 sails around time with its V8 engine like it is floating on air.  If you haven't looked at a used Lexus - give it a try.  They are much more affordable than you might think, and you can't beat the service or the resale value.


Oh yeah, and if you go soon, they are financing the used cars the used cars the exact same way as the new ones.  Go and give them a look!
