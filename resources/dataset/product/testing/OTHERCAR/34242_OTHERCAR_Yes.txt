            The solara is an excellent car; it surpasses the quality of many other cars in its class.

Exterior:
The Solara features clean lines and forms a perfect combination between sport and luxury. The spoiler is a must, it is a nice touch to accent the rear.  The paint of the car is scratches easily and chips from rocks (a attribute of many cars on the road in Colorado). An enhanced clearcoat may prevent these problems.

Interior: 
The Interior resembles that of a Lexus. People are greeted with wood accents and soft leather.  Gauges are easily read and ergonomics are none other than perfect. Rear seat room is incredable, larger than many mid-size sedans.

Performance:
The performance of the this coupe is impeccable.  The automatic transmission is VERY responsive. Just a mere tap and it down shifts readily.  Tourque, rated @ 214 lb/ft, is quite impressive.  Acceleration is robust from the 200 hp engine, and runs a 0-60 time in just over 7 seconds.
The car is smooth, but suspension may need to be a little firmer for those with a sports oriented tastes.

Before purchasing this car I looked at an Accord V6 coupe, Mitsubishi Eclipse GT, and Acura CL. None of the cars I tested offered the value and sophistication of the Solara as well as the quality and luxury.
