                 The 2000 Infiniti I-30 has everything you would want in a luxury car without the high price!  From the plush leather interior to the simple, yet elegantly-styled exterior, this luxury sedan is a dream to drive!
     The 227-horsepower Q6 engine delivers plenty of zip and power right off the starting block and continues to deliver exceptional power and performance through each gear.  This is one of those cars that you must keep a close eye on the speedometer because of the feeling that you are gliding along at speeds much slower than the actual speed.  The interior is extremely quiet.  Road noise is almost non-existent, and you feel as though you are driving in your own world even in heavy traffic.  Not to mention the 200-watt Bose stereo system with 7 speakers as well as a sub-woofer.  It is easy to tune the rest of the world out with exceptional sound and a CD player that delivers extremely crisp sound.
     This car has many standard features such as power seats, power moon roof, power rear sunshade, and even a rear view mirror automatic dimmer (to dim out those obnoxious high beam headlights behind you at night that almost blind you).  There are nooks, crannies, and compartments all over to stash all those small items you take along in the car with you.
     I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to spend a little more than they would on a Camry or Accord, yet really feel like they want a luxury car.  I purchased this car after having two Camrys and just paid a little more than I would have paid for a 2000 Camry with all the bells and whistles.  I am really happy with my choice, because I believe there is no comparison between the two.
     One thing you will always get is compliments!  Everyone comments on the beauty of the car.  You can't go wrong with this car!
