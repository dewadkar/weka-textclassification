Now if you use the economy mode you can stretch out 2054 pictures in the 800 x 600 resolution and 943 pictures in the 1600 x 1200 resolution.

<b>What you get</b>

<b>Pros</b>
It comes with enough storage so you won't have to purchase another memory card. Included is the 340 MB IBM Microdrive.

<b>Cons</b>
It comes with four AA alkaline batteries, they should have included NiMH rechargeable batteries with a charger. I recommend getting at least an extra set so you will have a charged set on hand all the time.

One thing missing is an optical viewfinder, you have to take your pictures from the 1.8" color LCD.

There is no adjustment for backlight brightness on the 1.8" color LCD.

The zoom control is small and kind of awkward to operate.

One thing I don't like is having to view you pictures through a Java-enabled web browser like Explorer or Netscape.

<b>Overall</b>
This is a nice camera from Casio even though they did not include a viewfinder. It handles well and the picture quality is great. 

There are several little cons that I have listed, if you can live with them then this is an excellent camera.
