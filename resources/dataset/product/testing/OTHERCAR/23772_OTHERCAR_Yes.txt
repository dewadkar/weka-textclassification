            Bought this dark blue Saturn with the DOHC engine because my wife didn't think her Toyota had enough power.  This SL2 5-speed will run circles around the Camry.  It was later given to my son and now has 210,000 miles on it.  It doesn't sit still very often.  Have had it in the shop only two times for repair.  First time to replace a constant velocity joint in the drive train and the second to replace the alternator.  It is a joy to drive. Handles great, lots of power and still gets 35 mpg on the highway. Can't beat it.  It is using a little oil now (quart every 1500 miles), but otherwise, everything still works.  Plastic body parts finish is still like new.  He plans on 300,000 and I think it will make it. Would buy another one without hesitation.

Well, this is the end. The clutch (original) finally wore out and just couldn't justify the $700 repair bill. So after 250,000 miles, the Saturn was sold for $500. It was using more oil, but still ran great. Still would buy another!
