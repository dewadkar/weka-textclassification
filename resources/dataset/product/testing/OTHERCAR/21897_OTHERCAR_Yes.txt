                I have just purchased a BMW 528i. I needed a midsize sedan with plenty of room in the trunk and in the back seat. I looked at several vehicles, but when I test drove this, I was sold.
    First, I'll talk about the suspension. My car has the sports suspension, but not the sports package. It handles even better than I could have suspected out of any luxury car. It really hugs the road. The suspension is stiff enough to handle a tight turn at 30, but still give you a soft ride. 
    The brakes are even better. The response is very tight. As soon as you touch the brakes, you can expect braking. Not only that, but it has enough stopping power to bring your car to a complete stop faster than any car in front of you can. I don't know if 528i's come standard with ABS, but mine has it. It works great. After the recent snow we had in our area, it really came in handy.
    The engine is great, it has more power than you'd expect from a 2.8 liter six cylinder engine. It comes stock with 190 horsepower (I have added a triflo exhaust and a K&N filter which really give it a boost). 190 may not seem like much, but the car has great gear ratios, and has great acceleration. I recently brought it in to the dealer for a check up, and just to give you an idea of maintenance, the bill was just barely four digits including installation. (They replaced the front brake rotors and pads and the belts on the engine) 
    The interior is very plush, but it also has my greatest problems. I have the leather interior, regular sound system, CD changer, power windows, regular (non-xenon) lights, power locks, intermittant wipers, and a sunroof. The problems are with the cupholders and lights. The cupholders are really cheap. They are fold out things with no real size to them and they are so low that they just flip drinks into your lap. The lights are great except that I'd expect to get automatic lights on the car. It is annoying having to turn them on every night. (I have them in my camaro and just got used to them, so my opinion is biased.)
   Other than that, I really recommend getting one of these. If I were to buy this car again, the only change I would make would be getting xenon lights. I have been in my friends' car with them and they really make the difference.
