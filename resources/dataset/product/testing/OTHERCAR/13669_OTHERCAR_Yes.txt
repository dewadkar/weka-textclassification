            Having owned a 1999 Isuzu Trooper for a year now, all I can say is &quot;Great Job Isuzu!&quot;

My wife decided she was ready for a larger vehicle to carry stuff in since we both owned small sports cars.  She sold her 1996 Acura Integra GSR and we went looking for SUV's.

We initially looked at Nissan XTerra's and Pathfinders.  The XTerra's looked good, basic, and at a reasonable price.  However, demand was such that there were few to look at and they were selling for MSRP or more.  The Pathfinders were nice, but seemed underpowered.  

My wife and I, both used to driving small, zippy cars really were appalled at the sluggishness of all the mid-size SUV's.  XTerra, Pathfinder, Passport, 4Runner....all just seemed like driving a moving van.  

We had originally ruled out a Trooper because we still assumed they were the old boxy style.  Then I happened to see a new one in a parking lot one day, and we decided it really did look much more refined.

I did some web research and discovered some interesting stuff.  For one thing, the Trooper's interior cargo volume is just large enough that it usually gets grouped in with full-size SUV's like Suburban and Expedition.  However, since the Trooper comes with V6 insead of the V8 power of the larger vehicles, it usually didn't compare well, and is often overlooked.

The truth is that the Trooper is really a mid-size SUV with a whole lot of  cargo space.  The Trooper was the only SUV that seemed to have any initial acceleration.  Plenty of power to spare.

Things I like:

The Torque On Demand works well.  Just keep it on all the time as road conditions will change faster than you can engage 4WD.  Plenty of power and low end torque.  I pull around a 4200 lb load (boat + trailer) with seemingly little effort.  The Trooper was the only SUV that came standard with 4WD (all models) and with protective steel skid plates.  I feel confident in saying that (with the possible exception of the 4Runner) the Trooper is the only SUV you could drive directly off the dealer's lot and immediately go off-roading.  It just comes equipped for it right off the bat, standard.

Things I would like improved:

Fuel economy, as with most SUV's is paltry.  I've never gotten the EPA mileage of 19 mpg.  I can accept this except for one problem.  The fuel tank capacity is only 22.5 gallons.  I'd really like to see that increase to around 26 or 28 gallons just to get that extra range between refueling stops.  

Our Trooper is black and we live in the Southeast US.  It gets oppressively hot and humid for about 5 months every year.  The air conditioner, while more than adequate for climates above the Mason-Dixon line, is substandard in the southeast.  It will cool off the passengers, but takes about 30 minutes to completely cool the air to a comfortable temperature in that 90 cubic feet of volume.

The Trooper drives as well as any other van or SUV.  I do notice that it typically sits a bit higher than most mid-size SUV's and pickups.  I know there is the bad press regarding Consumer Reports &quot;tipover&quot; tests.  Let me state a few FACTS about this:

Consumer Reports reported no tipover problems on models prior to 1994 (I think that is the year).  In 1995, Isuzu made the wheel track wider, lowered the center of gravity, and stiffened the suspension.  All of these changes would make the Trooper less likely to tipover, yet this is precisely when Consumer Reports claims the problem starts.  They were fine with it before, but now they aren't, which seems a little fickle to me at least.

In March 2000, a court ruled that Consumer Union (Consumer Reports) had misrepresented the results of its testing on the Trooper.  However, the judge only imposed a fine of $1 against Consumer Union.  Take that however you will.

My personal opinion is that the Trooper doesn't seem any more or less &quot;tippy&quot; than other SUV's.  It does seem to roll a bit more in turns, which can be a bit unsettling, but I've never felt it was even remotely dangerous.  The bottom line is that if you drive like a maniac and are constantly swerving to avoid a moose in the road, then you might eventually get one to tip over.

If you want lots of cargo space, plenty of pulling power, and don't want to fork over the $35,000 to $40,000 for a full-size SUV, I highly recommend the Isuzu Trooper.  It comes with tons of options standard, including selectable full-time 4WD.  Any other SUV you look at, these will be add-ons.
