            Having been an owner of the Canon S100, S110 in the past, I eagerly snapped up the latest camera in the family! I have had Kodak Digital Cameras, Sony, and Fuji in the past, and I have to say that the Canon S series just continues to improve! I'll summarize only the newer features below.

First of all the S200 includes the same classic steel body that the other Elph S series had. It improves on the shape, with further refinements on the sides and the general "curves" on the body.

The biggest changes in the camera controls is two fold. First of all, the switch that toggles between photo taking and picture viewing, has an added MOVIE mode. This makes it alot simpler and faster when wanting to take an AVI movie without having to go thru a bunch of menus to reach that mode. The movie mode could be improved, as you can record only 10-30s clips, probably due to limitations in an internal memory buffer, not due to the size of the CF card you are using.

Second, the controls for the settings, and menus is now vastly improved with a new 4 button circular controller that is much more intuitive and saves time between clicks to update the various pixel settings, lighting, flash, etc...I found this format much more intuitive than the prior S100/S110.

Battery life is excellent with the included Rechargeable battery! I would avoid any battery that needs standard AA or AAA batteries, b/c you WILL burn through these quickly. I have found that the Canon Camera will last  a full day of shooting at Disneyworld (LCD viewfinder turned off).

The camera includes all the basics that you'd expect, self timer, macro function, 2x zoom that the older S110 has, but also includes a new feature that automatically will properly vertically orient photos taken in the "up-down" orientation when the photos are downloaded to your computer.I also found that the flash and the red-eye reduction flash was better than on the S110.

Speaking of downloading, Canon still provides one of the best packages for picture downloading, archiving of any camera manufacturer. The ZoomBrowser for PC is excellent, and the Mac Software is even native in OS X. (A big big plus!! Canon is the first camera maker to update their software for OS X. The S200 is also natively compatible plug-n-play with OS X.

I am still waiting for Canon to introduce a camera of simliar size that is 3+ MP, Sony has recently announced their P9 camera that is a simlilar size, but 4MP! 

The Canon camera still has a very skimpy included CF card, only 8MB. This seems very cheap, since the prices on CF cards have fallen dramatically in recent months. ( I remember that the 128MB card I bought cost $170! now can be had for around $40!!)

In summary, this is another terrific camera. The small size makes it even better, because you are more likely to carry it around, and get use out of it!
