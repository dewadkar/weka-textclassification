             This is the Best car my wife and I have ever owned. We have always purchased used cars by far the cavalier is the most reliable. It is now 4 years old and runs just as good as it did the day I brought it home. When I bought it, our other car was running short on life, and I was extremely tired of taking it to the repair shop. Not to mention we needed a bigger car. 
 The cavalier rides exceptionally smooth and is tremendous on gas mileage. As the repair shop goes I am able to do all the repairs myself. Keep in mind I am not the most mechanically gifted person in the world. 
 There are a few things that I could live without. First The color , Its white, now we can get it painted another color so this really isn't a major problem. The second is this annoying exhaust hole. I am not sure where its coming from, but I have spoken to other 96' Cavalier owners who are experiencing the same problem. It doesn't affect the drive of the car, but gets a few strange looks from people in other cars.
 I would recommend this car for anyone, a single person can get a 2 door convertible or the family person can get a 4 door sedan. Either way It is one of the most economical cars in the market.
