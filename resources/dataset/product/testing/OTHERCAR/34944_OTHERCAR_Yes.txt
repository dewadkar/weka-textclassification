            I just bought a 2000 Grand Prix GTP sedan.  I have always preferred sports cars, but as a family man I need to be able to use a car seat, so a 4 door was necessary.  The GTP sedan was the answer to my prayers!  It was a real pain finding one without leather seats or a moon-roof (options that are useless to me, therefore unwarranted expenses).  My last car was a 1993 Grand Prix sedan with a 200 hp 3.4 L engine.  I had fun driving that car, but the new one is a BLAST! It handles like a dream and, while it's not a Ferrari, the acceleration from the supercharged 3.8 L V6 is enough to elicit a grin from me!

The interior is certainly much nicer than in my old GP.  There are a lot of nice extras like a collapsible cup holder and a storage case for sunglasses.  It even has a holder for a garage remote designed so that you can use the remote without removing it.  One feature I find especially handy has to do with the door locks.  Press the lock button once and you hear 3 chimes.  You can then exit the car, close the door, and you have five seconds to open any other door.  Once the last door is closed, the locks engage after five seconds.  This is great if you have to get to a car seat in the back.  No more leaving the front door open until you have your child out of the car.  This may sound confusing , but those of you with kids know what I'm talking about.

Now, the HUD. The heads-up display shines the speedometer reading (along with some other stuff) up on the windshield.  It is adjustable in terms of position and brightness and can be removed completely.  I have found that I drive slower now since I always know how fast I'm going rather than driving at a comfortable speed (which is usually ten miles over the limit).  In any case it's a neat toy that gives a George Jetson feel to the car.

Negatives:  The rear-view mirror gives a much smaller view than I am used to, however the side mirrors are nice and big, which helps to make up for it.  I have bumped my head lightly a few times on the overhead console as I get into the car.  The glove box is rather small.  The GTP needs Premium gasoline - the price you pay for this kind of performance.  Other than these, I haven't found any negatives.

If you need a 4-door and crave sport car performance (and can't afford a BMW), this is the car for you!  If you don't need a 4-door, I'm not sure why you'd want a Grand Prix as opposed to a Firebird Formula, but that's all personal choice.

ONE YEAR LATER:  It's been a year since I got th Grand Prix and I still am very happy with it.  I have not yet had any warranty issues or any issues at all.
