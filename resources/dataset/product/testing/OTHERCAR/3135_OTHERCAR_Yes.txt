            I honestly thought that we were "settling" when my wife and I decided to get a Hyundai Elantra as our first new car.  But hey, the price was right and we certainly couldn't argue with the excellent warranty... so we pulled the trigger and went with a nice, shiny, silver Elantra GLS.

At first, it seemed to be a bad call-- the heater did not work in our brand new car, and it was freezing outside!  We took it back in and they realized that the people installing the security system had undone the wiring and then not hooked it back up.  Duh.

So... fast forward 9 months.  We now have 17K miles on the car, and it has been back to the shop three times... NO WAIT!  It's not the Hyundai's fault-- this is only because we have been hit TWICE by hit-and-run morons (great neighborhood), so the car has been in the body shop.  The other shop call was to install a flap of some sort to take care of a recall issue from Hyundai-- it had not adversely affected our vehicle.  

We have driven our Elantra all over New England and on several trips to NYC-- it is very comfortable, even on the longer road trips.  It has good pick-up, as long as we are not drag-racing a Porsche or anything, and it feels solid on the road.  

The true test for me, however, came when we took it in for its most recent body work... maybe two weeks ago.  The rental car that we got was a brand-spankin'-new Toyota Corolla, which was one of the cars I had in the back of my mind that maybe we should have purchased when we got the Elantra.  

Frankly, in my book, the Elantra kicked the Corolla's patoot.  I was shocked to note that the Hyundai handles better, is more comfortable, feels MUCH more solidly built, and has more power than the Toyota.  It wasn't even close.  After a few days with the rental car, I could not wait to get the Elantra back!  

The only real negatives I can mention about our Elantra would be that the interior fabric seems to wear rather quickly.  Also, some of the people at the dealership kind of bug me, but that isn't the car's fault.

With only my own experience to go on, I am convinced that Hyundai has turned the corner from their ickier days of yore.  They really seem to be making great cars!  We are very pleased with ours.
