            This was it...  the expected repair bill on my old '78 Ford LTD exceeded the actual value of the car.  And I was just sick of driving this gigantic old gas-guzzling unreliable land yacht.  I'd held on to it for too long, (15 years) partly due to procrastination, partly for sentimental reasons.  It was my first car, inherited when my father died back when I was 21.  In its younger days it was great, but now it was time to put it out to pasture.

Buying new was out of my budget, so I asked my mechanic for his recommendation for a good used car, thinking he would tell me to "buy American" as others had... but no, he said Japanese cars are more reliable, and to only buy American if I wanted to see a lot more of him. 
 
"Get yourself a little Corolla or a Honda Civic.."

So, being the obsessive researcher that I am I got the "Consumer Reports" guide to used cars, and found that my mechanic was right, Corollas and Civics are highly rated, and also read a little about a car that I'd never really heard much about, the Mazda Protege.   

I started my search, after determining that $10,000 was the absolute highest I could afford.  I looked in the paper and online, and found that Corollas and Civics under 10,000 tended to be older higher mileage vehicles, or "salvage titles".   The few Proteges I turned up seemed to sell for less, so I did a little more research on sites like Edmunds.com and read lots of good things about this little car, and learned that it is a good alternative to Toyota and Honda, especially if you want something a little different, and maybe a little more stylish looking. Even though some of the reviewers thought the car was underpowered and sluggish, the pros seemed to outweigh the cons, and I centered my search on the Protege.

After many test drives, I finally came across my dream car, a '98 Protege LX with only 16,000 miles, which had been driven by a suburban Mom, who was expecting another baby and had bought a mini-van.  After a little bit of haggling I purchased the car for $9700, and drove it home.

In the last three months of driving this car I've found it more than sufficient for my needs, which is primarily driving myself to work, and shopping with Mom on the weekends.

I find it reaches freeway speeds easily, and drives smoothly.  Its a very nimble little car, it brakes nicely and turns on a dime. To me it has a "sports car" feel.  (I wouldn't want to challenge a Porsche or a Viper in a race, but it has plenty of zip for my needs). And after driving that old dinosaur of mine, u-turns and parallel parking have been something of an epiphany for me.  It's a little noisy at high speeds on uneven roads, but not enough to really annoy me.
It can "chug" on hills, especially if its loaded with passengers (usually its just me though), but I can pop the Overdrive off with the flick of a button to get that extra power I need.

The interior is very attractive, and roomy. Roomier than the other cars in its class in fact.  My hubby is 6'1" and still has plenty of head and leg room. 
There is loads of trunk space, I can fit my groceries and my mother's in there easily. The rear seat folds down if I need to load a larger item.
It seats myself and 3 passengers comfortably.  I could wedge in a 4th if they wanted to sit on the "hump" in the back seat, but I haven't tried it yet.

It has a few extras that I didn't think I'd get in the price range I was looking in: power windows and door locks (the doors lock automatically when I start the engine, and unlock when I turn it off), keyless entry, power mirror adjustment, rear window defogger, an alarm, and a really nice sound system.  The CD player came as standard equipment, and a cassette player was added later.

I had my mechanic look at it shortly after I brought it home and he pronounced it an "nice little car", and said that it should last me for years to come!
