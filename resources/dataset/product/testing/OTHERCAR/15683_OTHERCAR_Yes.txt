            Hi Guys
 
I recently had a ride in my friends C-Class. Altough I have driven the earlier C-Class also but the New C-Class is just toooo good. I just loved this car. This car has all the attributes of a Mercedes and has many designing cues of the new S-Class and at the same time is very very affordable... 

This is really very nice and compact. It is very easy to take this to the crowded streets of New Delhi and also to te rough highways of India. The ride in this Mercedes is so smooth that after sitting in this I felt as if I was not being driven on the contrary I felt that I was just sitting in a car which was parked.

The C-Class has recently been launched by Mercedes Benz India Limited in India also and now I hope it will make all the other competitors run back to their design sheets because it is really had for all the other cars to compete with the C- Class.

Anyways I woudl just say this that if you want complete driving pleasure at an affordable cost then the C-Class is the best choice for you.

Bye for now more later....

Abhishek
