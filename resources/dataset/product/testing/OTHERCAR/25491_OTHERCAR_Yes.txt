 The Florida sun was scorching and the long bike rides to work were too much. We needed a car, I demanded a good price, good safety features, and of course reliability. After searching many dealerships, and dealing with many rude salesmen, we found our happiness. The people who work at Saturn are exactly the wonderful, caring people you see in the commercials. The safety features on the Saturn SL include a steel reinforced cage, child locks, dual front air bags, and the back seats curve so that a child cannot slip out of their seat belt. I love saving money on gas, the way it looks expensive, the good price and the overall sweet personality it seems to have. It drives so smoothly you'd swear you were driving a luxury vehicle. It does wonderfully in all kinds of weather, including snow! If you want a reliable, good looking car, that can save you money on gas, and possibly save your life, this car is for you. If you can only be happy spending an insane amount of money on a car, don't buy a Saturn.<br><br>
