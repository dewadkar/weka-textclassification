            I bought the Sony MVC-FD73 for job related activities.  I am an electrician for an electrical contractor.  Part of my job is to bid on new work and to coordinate work progress.  This camera fills the need nicely.  The feature that is most useful to me is the ability to quickly pull out the floppy and plug it into any computer and instantly show a customer or fellow electrician a picture. Printing pictures or putting the floppy into a job file makes for great information for the future.  The zoom feature works when I can't get close enough to see the problem, and the close-up shots provide an excellent picture for detail.<br><br>
