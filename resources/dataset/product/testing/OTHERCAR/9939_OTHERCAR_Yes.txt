            I admit, I come from a long time GM family.  So, what am I doing writing a review of a Chrysler?  Well, you see it is a company vehicle.  I had no say in the purchase of this vehicle. Without any prior Chrysler experience, I would have likely chosen the GM equivalent Buick LeSabre or Olds Eighty Eight.  I can now say that the Chrysler Concorde is a very competent car worth considering.

For being a full sized car, you'd never know it while driving it.  It handles just as well as any mid-sized car and offers excellent visibility.  It also has a surprisingly tight turning radius, which makes parking a breeze.  

One complaint I have is the lack of sound deadening material in the interior.  This car picks up alot more road and engine noise than I am otherwise used to.  Good thing it has a good stereo system to drown it out:-) The electronic climate controls can also be a bit confusing to get used to.  With the 50/50 front seat, you actually get two front armrests -one on each half of the seat.  Each contains a cupholder, but there is no storage area.  This has been upgraded in the new bodystyle Concorde so there is one wide center armrest with two cupholders and storage.  

The car now has over 120,000 mostly highway miles with no major problems, though after a visit to the dealer once for tire rotation, one of the wheels fell off.  The front passenger power lock stopped working with the remote for a while.  Ah, speaking of the locks, I almost forgot;
this car has automatic power locks that lock when the car exceeds 15mph.  If any of the doors are already locked it makes an odd grinding noise while attempting to lock them.  <br><br>
