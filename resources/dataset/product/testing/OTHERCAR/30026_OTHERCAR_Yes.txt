            I got this camera about a year ago for a present and to this date, have not had any real problems with it.

I was not a computer person at the time, so the thought of trying to figure out how to make this work on my computer was not something I was looking forward to.  After hooking up the camera and putting the CD into the CD reader, I found that the entire process was step by step and very simple so that I could understand what was going on.

I have used this camera for weddings, birthdays, and just taking pictures around the house and am very happy with it.

The pictures are sharp in detail, and the camera saves them in a jpg format so they do not take up huge amounts of space like some of the other camera's I have seen.

The camera has several controls and options on it, which at first, were a bit confusing, but after playing around with it a bit, it turns out it is actually very easy to use.

One of the nicest things I like about the camera is that to download the pictures to your computer, you just have to plug the camera in and turn it on and it starts the program automatically to do it for you.  I have found that sometimes the camera will give me an error that the computer can not find it, and to check my connections, however turning the camera off and right back on usually gets it to work right away.
One other problem that I had once was that the camera locked up and would not do anything.  After calling the service department, they were very friendly, and gave me step by step instructions over the phone on how to format the memory card, and I have not had a problem since.  Other than that the only other complaint I really have is that the viewer window is located right about where you have to put your nose when looking through the viewfinder, so it gets smudged up at times.


Overall, the camera is easy to use, and lets me take great pictures without many of the hassles that some of the other camera's I have looked at have done. The camera is a bit on the expensive side, at about $600 but you get what you pay for, and the customer service can't be beat.

I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera that is easy to use, takes great pictures, and has the backing of a company that has been around for a long time.<br><br>
