            Once you get over the price (list $999, discounted to about $750) and start using the DC265 you'll be amazed at the ease of use, and clarity of resultant pictures.  I've been printing 8&quot; x 10&quot; prints on my HP 850 deskjet printer with amazing results.  The camera is easy to use in just about all lighting conditions.  Although the camera comes with 16MB flashcard memory, plan on buying at least a 48MB flashcard in addition (but buy it on the Internet, about $102).  The 48MB flashcard allows you memory for about 96 snapshots.
The only negative is that the batteries don't last long, and you'll be constantly recharging them.  Buy a spare set of rechargeables, you'll need them.
Kodak maintains a web page where updates to the software on the camera is made available.  This is a very valuable service provided by Kodak.  The camera was designed to be upgraded as necessary by Kodak, which should keep the camera up-to-date for several years.... a distinctive feature not offered by some other digital cameras.<br><br>
