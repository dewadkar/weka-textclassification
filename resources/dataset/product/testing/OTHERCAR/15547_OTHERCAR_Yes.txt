            When I first noticed Oldsmobile marketing their cars towards the younger generation, I thought it would be difficult for them to shake their image of making vehicles for the Florida-bound retirees. With the Oldsmobile Alero, I've been proven wrong.

This vehicle is <b>not</b> your typical Olds. Not only is it much smaller than Oldsmobiles of years past (remember the Eighty Eight?), but it's surprisingly fun to drive! I drove the GLS model with all the options (leather seating, sunroof, rear spoiler, 3.4L V6), and out of the 4 vehicles I've owned previously (3 of which were sporty imports), this has been my favorite so far!

With electronically controlled steering that provides less assistance at higher speeds, the handling is tight and responsive. The Antilock brake system performs excellently, with minimal braking distance on a 60mph-0 panic stop (I took this car into the parking lot at my job for a little &quot;proving&quot;), and the acceleration on this vehicle is great for getting around those Sunday drivers who get out there during rush hour. The Alero GLS grips the road with Goodyear Eagle Performance Radials, and a sport suspension that makes potholes and speed bumps seem like minor blemishes in the road.

The comfort of the Alero is unparalleled by vehicles in its size class, especially in the GLS, which comes standard with leather seats/shift knob/steering wheel, a 6-way driver's power seat, and cruise control.

The only &quot;con&quot; I can think of on this vehicle is the stereo. I would appreciate it if the Alero had the option of having the 8-speaker Monsoon system available in the Pontiac Firebird, or the 450-watt Bose system available in the Cadillac Seville STS (imagine <i>that</i> power in this small of a car!). With powerful stereo systems being a &quot;selling point&quot; of a car for younger buyers, I don't know why Oldsmobile would market this vehicle to 18-30 year old buyers with the weak sound system that comes with it. Something I would consider a &quot;con&quot; if I were a smoker is the location of the cigarette lighter. Lodged in front of the gearshift, it's extremely hard to get to if the car is in park.

I would recommend this vehicle for anyone who wants comfort and power without the $30,000 price tag it so often comes with. Keep in mind that I'm only 5'8&quot;, so the comfort level might vary for some of you taller gentlemen out there, but the power remains impressive, especially for an Oldsmobile. 

P.S. - For those of you thinking about buying an Alero, you might want to wait until Oldsmobile releases its &quot;OSV&quot; (Oldsmobile Specialty Vehicle) line. Similar to Ford's &quot;SVT&quot; line of vehicle, Oldsmobile OSV's will be more powerful and have a wider range of options. The OSV line is currently touring the country at car shows. <br><br>
