                For this review, I am going to address the issue from the point of view of an average Joe. I'm not going to state the technical facts, I'm just going to give an honest opinion regarding what this car can do for you.
    First of all, for the price of this car, well equipped, it is definitely a performer. Outperforming Ford's Mustang and Pontiac's Firebird in many tests isn't a small feat, and that should be appreciated.
Another thing about the car is it's decent gas mileage. 19-21 miles to a gallon from an eight-cylinder engine is great compared to some other manufacturers,and the engine output is better than ever.

    The handling is great, the passenger compartment is first class, and the price makes these things seem even better.
    One more thing about it is the ease in which modifications are installed. The Chevrolet Camaro has long been a favorite of car enthusiasts and many after-market parts are available for it.Get this, with just a 90 dollar chip, you can increase the engine output by 20-30% with little or no change in gas mileage or other things. There are many other little things you can do to increase performance, such as exhaust mods, intake mods, transmission mods and electrical mods.

      So, if you are looking for a nice, smooth ride, or maybe something to blow all those Cobras and Ram Airs off the road with, look no further than the Chevrolet Camaro.
