            The S2000.  It's flashy and it's fast, but it's never really fit into any category.  If you're looking for something fast and powerful, you look towards Porsche and Audi.  If you want a family car, you head towards Honda and Volvo.  I would have thought that Honda's changes for the better would have formed the S2000 into a more economy type car.  Instead they have taken all the practability out of it, jazzed up it's look, and made it a lot more fun.  I test drived the S2000 at my local dealer, although I never really considered purchasing.  I was definitely impressed.  It was light and fast, and it seemed as though the handling fit like a glove.  I was making turns at 45 without a bit of hesitation, and you could really feel the strength that went through the Honda.  It does have a few problems though.  And actually, Honda has make it a bit awkward to drive.  

The console.  This is a quite important piece of the car, as it tells you some information vital to driving a car.  Honda took it and turned it into a video game.  They're seemed to be charts and graphs and features and whatever else they could think of to make it look goofy.  It hurt your head just looking at it.  I have heard that a lot of the more recent releases were equipped with standard consoles, and if you find one like that, it's gonna be a lot more easier on you than the one I test drove.  

Now for the family man.  This is a nice looking car, but merely a toy.  There is no possible way you could use this for a family, as it has only two seats (duh) and basically no storage room.  I mean none.  The trunk is small, and I'm really not even sure if it fits a spare tire.   Even the glove compartment has been shrunken down, as it now folds out vertically.  Although it looks like everything would fall out of it, it does work alright.  Yet, I'd definitely rather have a standard glove compartment.  Just like the console, this is one of Honda's other "fun little gizmos."  Gas mileage isn't that bad for a family car, but simply ranks up with other sports cars.  The dealer said it could get 26 miles to the gallon, but I'd really say it's more like 22.  If you wanted a practical car, turn around right now.  The game's up on the S2000.  

Price.  Well, I'm not really sure if it's good or bad.  Since I don't know if I'm judging a sports car or an economy car, I'll just say that it costs about $33k, but the dealers are getting up for $29k.  If you get it through to them that you know how much their paying, a lot of dealers will give you the car for 30k and change.  For a sports car 33 thousand isn't bad, but it's no Porsche.  But the S2000 does have 240 horses, so I'd say that for 30k, you're getting a pretty good deal.  (Once again, you're buying a toy.) This is the kind of decision you'd really want to think over before plunking down the cash.  At the rate they're going right now, in a year you should be able to get one used for 15 or 16k.  Then again, it would be used.

My conclusion is good for this car.  If you want a snappy sports car with a fairly good price and mediocre gas mileage, you've found your car.  It looks good on the road for all you chick magnets and it comes in quite a variety of colors.  There's a new blue color, but I still prefer the black.  You'll be getting a much better value if you can work your dealer down to $30k, and if you buy one now remember that it'll probably have the "video game" console and the annoying glove compartment.  You could surely get those things changed, but then you'd be putting more money down, and once you're talking in the $40k range, the S2000's simply overpriced.  Look over the options before you buy and test drive.  If you test drive it first, you might just simply fall in love.
