            I'm a single male, aged 27, and I bought this car when I was 24.  I can see this very car being used as a family car (at least to start).  I've owned my 1997 Chevy Monte Carlo (3.1L) since September 1996.  It's been very good with a few minor exceptions.  I love the shape of the body and the combination of sheet metal and plastic exterior.  Smooth contour lines give this body a little bit of sportiness.  It's very easy to wash and maintain (I've done most of the work myself).  I love the radio buttons on the steering wheel.  The warranty service was superb.  Great trunk space.  Long life fluids are a plus, stainless steel exhaust, 100000 mile tuneup, etc.

I hate the fact that the visor clips keep popping off- this seems small, but it's very irritating.  Also, there's only one cup holder- not a problem for driving solo, but it can be an issue.  I've only had warranty issues with the radio and the oxygen sensor.  It was disappointing that the warped rotors were not covered by the warranty after only 12,000 miles.

Driving the car feels like a combination of a sports car and an old man's luxury car.  The steering is tight, but it's a little bigger than midsize and has a smooth ride.

Having said all that, I think it's a perfect car for a single person between the ages of 20 and 30.  The fact that it's a two-door makes it less appealing to a parent, though the chassis is identical to that of the more family-oriented Lumina.<br><br>
