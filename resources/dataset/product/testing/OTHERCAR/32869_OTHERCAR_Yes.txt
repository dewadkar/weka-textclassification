            I'm new to the digital camera world but I've been researching it for months. After going through tons of pictures taken with all the top contenders the nikon coolpix series remains on top. What drove me towards the nikons where the macro abilities these things have! Crisp clear huge close-ups without having to spend $1,000 or more on just a macro lens. The colors are crisp and everything is sharp. The fully auto mode on the 880 can handle any situation your in without a problem. You can see some of the pix I've taken with it at www.zing.com member name xtwizx. I'm just starting and they are impressive. The one thing that bugs me about this camera, maybe I'm doing something wrong, is that when you unplug the serial connection the camera locks up sometimes. Anyone know why this happens? Oh and don't forget to take the lens cap off before you turn the camera on. You don't have to buy the AC adapter from Nikon at that crazy price either, I bought a 30.00 Digipower AC adapter for the Coolpix models that works just fine(Get them at Boscov's, Ritz, Staples, pretty much anywhere). All in all this camera is the best your going to do for the price period! I've tested it against other camera's of the same specs, olympus, sony, ect. and they couldn't hold a candle. Came nowhere close on indoor shots. You can never go wrong buying a Nikon.
