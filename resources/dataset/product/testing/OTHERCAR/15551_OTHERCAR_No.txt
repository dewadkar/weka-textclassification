            Overall, not impressed.  Currently the car is 26 months old and most 76K miles were highway miles cruise control 70 MPH 

Cons:  

Many little problems.  

Car can drive itself to the dealer it has been there so many times. (actually 2 different dealers)

Fog lights have burned out minimum of 4 times (not covered by the 60K protection plan and nothing wrong with the electrical).

Paint has chipped off 2 different radios and some interior buttons (not covered by protection plan)

Pads and rotors were replaced at 15K (warranty GM parts) and pads then wore out again at 46K.  Put aftermarket pads on and 30K later they still have over 50% left.  Rotors went again at 70K and were replaced. This is a highway driven vehicle, how can the pads burn out in 30K????

Fit and finish terrible.  Doors do not close the way they did when the car was new.

Grinding in the front area at low speeds, dealer has looked at it 5 times minimum and never found anything.

The leather seats are very uncomfortable.  I regularly do 4+ hour drives and 4 hours is about the absolute max you want to be sitting in those seats (lower back).  I have never had a seat comfort issue with any other car I have owned.

The plastic ground effects under the front have broke 3 times (and I have seen other Aleros with the same problem). I do not remember hitting any parking pylons to brake them. Of course this is not covered by either the warranty or the protection plan. The part is about $30.00 (each time) and is a pain to put on. 

I have lost the rubber insert for the cup holder because of its tendency to stick to large drink cups and I must have thrown it away accidentally. 

Also, really only one of the drink holders in the front is usable with a drink larger than a standard can due to the forward position of the second cup holder. Also, if you have anything plugged into the lighter socket it makes it very hard to maneuver a drink in and out of the forward cup holder. 

I have also replaced a wheel cover for the lug nuts that disappeared/fell off/ etc. That was a $25.00. 

Not counting maintenance, I figure to have spent about $250 in parts that I do not feel that I should have had to replace. This does not include my time to replace them (which is the bigger issue). 


That 5 year 60000 lime warranty is a joke!  After 36K (which I was at after 12 months) no trim work is covered and many other little things are not.  The dealers really do not explain this and in 2001 the commercials were misleading (5 year 60K warranty advertised not 3/36 +2/24 Protection Plan).  So I waited until about 50K to take it in for many small issues and was told that it wasn't covered in the PP.  My mistake... 

Pros:

Good tires!!  76K and easily have another 30K left on original tires!!

No major problems (yet, but I'm waiting for something bad to happen, now that it is totally out of warranty)

GM's engine oil system allows oil changes much less frequently then 3K (actually for me about 6-7K)

Good sound from the "Sun and Sound" package

I would say it is peppy and has good pickup. The power is proportional if not above average. 

The handling is very good.  On this car I did get the sport suspension so I can not speak on the standard suspension. 

The back seat is usable.  I am 5'10 and if you move the front seats up about an inch or 2 from the farthest back positions it is comfortable to sit for an adult. 

Average aspects...

The noise on the highway, I would say is average. It is not the quietest car but you do not have to scream to the passenger while on the freeway. 

Gas mileage is about 25-28 highway 

Overall....

The car does get you (in a very uncomfortable seat) from point A to B but it seems every time I turn around there is a trim panel/light/part that needs to be repaired/replaced. That is my major annoyance on the vehicle. I feel that a $21,000 car SHOULD be built not to have minor problems within 2 years and 76,000 highway miles. I was also very frustrated with the dealers response of "I have seen paint chip off many radios" and comments like that.  If I was using it for delivery or a downtown cab I would expect more issues.
