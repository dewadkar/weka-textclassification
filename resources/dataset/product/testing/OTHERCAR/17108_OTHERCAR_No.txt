            I dont like this car.  I know that it has the Mercedes name and all but it really isnt that good.  No wonder it is Mercedes' least expensive car.
  Everybody says that it is a luxury SUV, yeah right it is more like a 5 seated mini van.  I have to admit that the front interior of this car is nice, but the back seat is awefull.  The seats are crammed up into the back of the front seats and they are very uncomfortable. Then leaving an enormous trunk space that you will never use.
   The engine is only a v6 and with the size of the car, the engine is too small, all suv's should have a v8.  I would recomend a Land Rover because you get the added v8 engine for the same price. 

  The base price of the M-Class is $33,950, but if you want leather seats,sun roof, cd player, inhanced sound system ect. you will end up paying around the 40 thousand range.  
 
    A good point about this car is that it is very High tech, which it has an active handling system that will control the car automaticlly if it is loosing control. (i.e. if a tire is spinning the brake for that tire will ingadge and prevent an accident.)  The car also has a state of the art sucerty system, and dual front and side airbags.
