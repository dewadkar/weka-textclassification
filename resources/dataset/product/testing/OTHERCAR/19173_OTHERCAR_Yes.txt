            I bought a VW beetle back in the 60's when I was first married.  As the family grew, we outgrew the car.  I was very unimpressed with later VW entries until I saw the new Bug and the Passat.  I needed a new car and read many reviews.  The Passat kept coming to the top of the list of cars to consider.  Consider I did. A test drive proved that all my reading had been correct.  I purchased a 1999 Passat with 4 cylinder turbo.  This  car is solid and holds the road better than any vehicle I have driven for quite some time.  It has very few options because most of what a driver wants in a car is there.  There was little haggling about price because the car is popular and dealers are not anxious to cut price.  I can deal with that , I thought. The purchase was handled in a most professional way.  There were  none of the usual pressure tactics which make a visit to a dealer an unpleasant experience.  My salesman suggested that I go further and test drive other cars before I made a decision.  I had made a decision and it has proven to be a wise one.  I have and will continue to recommend VW Passat.  Incidentally, visits after the purchase have also been superbly handled.  Warranty check-ups have been done and follow up telephone calls made to ensure my satisfaction.  VW is a major player again.<br><br>
