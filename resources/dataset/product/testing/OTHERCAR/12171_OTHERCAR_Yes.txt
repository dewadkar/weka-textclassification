            Presently I drive a 1994 Oldsmobile Bravada and I love it.  It has over 115,000 miles on it and very little has gone wrong (other than the normal maintainence).  It has great pickup and is very comfortable to ride in.  The ride is superior to any other sport utility i have driven and those who ride in the car always remark on it's comfort and smooth ride.  I am graduating from college and looking to get a new car.  A few days ago I test drove the new Bravada and it was everything that I hoped it would be and more.  It is the same car that I have now with some additional features for the year 2000.  If you can afford to get this car over vehicles such as the Blazer and the Jimmy, I highly suggest that you check it out.  Happy shopping!!<br><br>
