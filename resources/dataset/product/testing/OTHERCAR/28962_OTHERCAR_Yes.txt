            I have owned a 2000 model Hyundai Sonata GLS with upgrades (leather, high end CD player) and am very pleased.  Externally, it is a very attractive vehicle, with 7 spoke alloy wheels that really shine.  The fit and finish rivals anything I have seen in its class (Camrys, Hondas), yet the car is several thousand dollars less expensive.  Inside, the leather is very comfortable and attractive, the radio/CD player performs flawlessly.  The car handling reminds me of my RX-7: tight, firm, but not harsh at all. It corners extremely well, and holds the road superbly.  I have inspected the car with virtually a magnifying glass, inside and out, and I have not found anything to criticize.  The little details amaze me..the ways the wiring are strapped together, the organization of the engine and components. The only complaint I have is that the center armrest is not long enough to be able to rest my right arm on it and hold the steering wheel.  
Basically, what you have here is a V-6 Camry clone at a far less price.  Who can argue with that?  And the warranty is the best in the industry. I highly recommend it.
In addition, I used an internet service to purchase the vehicle and finance it as well, and I saved even more than if I were to purchase it directly from a dealer.<br><br>
