            I bought my 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport a little more than a year ago.  First of all let me say that if you're going to buy a Jeep Wrangler then you need to know what you are buying!  You are not buying a car.  If you think that you are, you are sadly mistaken and will be one of those people who are giving Jeeps a bad rap.  They are noisy, hard riding, all terrain vehicles.  My Jeep is Navy with the Spice Top.  I would only buy a Jeep that had the "real" doors with glass.  I would never even think of having one with plastic windows in the doors. This cuts the noise about 1/3. I also opted for the V-6 with the 5 speed transmission. True this engine is a gas hog but the improved horsepower and torque is worth it. Another handy option is the sound bar this greatly improves sound quality.  Mine has the soft top and of course there is noise when you are running 70 miles an hour on the interstate.  I have also opted for larger tires and wheels.  I have the cloth seats(do not get vinyl seats).  Theft is a constant threat. I did have someone slash my top(insurance replaced it) after that ordeal I spent some money and put an alarm with led display on it and have not had any trouble since.  One option that I added was the matching spice tire cover for the spare on the rear.  I also bought and installed locking lug nuts on all four wheels and the spare.  I love mine and I have taken it off road.  I also have driven it in the snow and ice and it is a very capable four wheel drive vehicle. Storage what storage?  It's a Jeep and it is truly a "Jeep" thing.  There is also an unspoken kindred spirit between Jeep owners.  You hardly pass one on the road that the driver doesn't throw up his hand.  I own another vehicle and I don't drive my jeep every day.  My other vehicle is a 2000 Maxima SE.  So all I ask is that you please know what you are buying and try one out(ask owners).  They are one of the coolest recreational vehicles on the road today.
