            The VW Passat is a great drivers car.  I personally am a hard driver on vehicles and I love the Passat.  It has a stiff suspension to take corners hard, yet is smooth on straight roads.  The look of the Passat is also very great.  The smooth lines and the sleek shape is extremely eye catching.  The one I own is Colorado Red and that in itself is eye catching.  The interior is also very functional.  Everything is within reach and the controls are easy to work.  Also, I am an avid manual transmission guy and I love the feel and control that a manual transmission offers to the driver.  The Passat I own has an automatic transmission though.  Oh but wait!  It has a Tiptronic transmission system.  Tiptronic is a system in the Passat that allows you to drive the automatic normally, or switch it to a clutchless manual transmission, which I prefer.  This system is amazing because it still feels like you're driving a manual transmission.  You can feel the car and you can tell it exactly when to shift.  One downfall of the system is the small delay between when you tell it to shift and when it actually shifts, but it is a small delay.
  Another great part of this car is the steering wheel adjustment.  The wheel not only moves up and down, it also moves in and out.  It is a telescopic wheel which is really handy for shorter drivers or just for anyone who would like the wheel exactly where they need it.  Everyone who has ever driven the car, from my 5'2&quot; mother, to my 6'2&quot; father found the steering wheel was able to set PERFECTLY where they wanted it to, which is rare.
  The one major problem I have with the Passat occurred when I tried to get new rims for it.  The lug pattern in the Passat is a rare one and the only rims that we could find were very expensive.  They ended up to cost us about $2000 for all four, which was way more than we had ever planned on spending.  But again, this upgrade in rims made the car look even more incredible!  If you do buy rims for this car, go big.  Go to a 16 inch or a 17 inch chrome wheel.  The look is absolutely amazing.
  Overall I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a luxury car ride with a bit of sports car in it.<br><br>
