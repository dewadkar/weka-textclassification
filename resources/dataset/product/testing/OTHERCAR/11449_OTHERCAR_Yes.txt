            I've found the perfect P&S dig-cam. I've owned a Canon S330 (heavy with few custom image features and supersaturated color) and have used an Olympus Stylus (bad shutter lag). This Panasonic is a great little box, comes in colors (mine's silver), and is not the average kid on the block. I have no need for anything over 3MP and think that most P&S consumers don't either.

BUILD
The F1 is very well built. It is small enough to fit in a pocket, but big enough for average hands to click all buttons easily.  I'm impressed with the weight, as its about half as heavy as a Canon Elph without having a cheap plastic feel.  I like power-cycling the camera via the switch instead of other cams where you must hold down a button.

CHARGER
The battery charger is sturdy and solid.  While the Canon S330 charger plugs directly into the wall, this one connects via a power cable.  However, a great feature is that a cable is included to run the camera on DC power by connecting it to the charger.  USB and A/V cables are also included.

CUSTOM FEATURES
The F1 has some great features. There's an idiot-proof mode for those times when you hand it over for somebody else to take your photo.  An Auto-Bracketing feature snaps 3 shots with one shutter-click at +/- 1/3 EV stops.  Macro, landscape (infinite depth-of-field), portrait (small DOF) all work very well.  For enhancement, you can choose "warm" for smooth skintones, "cool" for shots outdoors with lots of blue and green, or "black/white".

PHOTO QUALITY is where it counts most. The shots from this camera are extremely crisp thanks to the Leica lens.  The color is very accurate and I appreciate that I can change the color options in the camera without having to upload the pics and use Photoshop.

SOFTWARE
The Upload/Viewer program launches quickly and is easy to use.  I use Win2000Pro and have had no problems.
