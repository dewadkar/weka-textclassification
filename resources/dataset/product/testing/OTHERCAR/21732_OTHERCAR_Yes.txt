            I used to work as a mechanic in the late 1980's to pay for my college expenses.  By the end of that experience I had resolved that I would never own a GM vehicle; they were unreliable and just not conducive to repair and maintenance work as the parts were hard to access under the hood (and often full of sharp edges).  Apparently GM has undergone a change in philosophy since then, or hired a new engineering staff.  No only has the car been reliable and high performing, but I'm not dreading doing my own maintenance!

I've owned my used '98 Cavalier for 6 months now, taken two 1,800 mile trips with it, and have zero mechanical concerns.  I own the four-door model with the 2.2 liter engine and 4-speed automatic transmission.  I typically cruise at 75 mph and it will hold that speed or even accelerate on the steepest of hills; the transmission downshifts smoothly at the optimum point and the tachometer needle stays comfortably out of the red.  The steering is smooth and easy to handle at highway speed.  (This is all while carrying a family of four and a trunk full of luggage.)  A bit of wind noise does come through the door seals.

Under the hood maintenance wise?  Well, it's an improvement from the 1980's, but I've seen better.  Changing the oil at home required that I raise the front of the car onto jack stands since it's so low to the ground, and the nose extends so far that I couldn't use ramps.  I had to use the Chevy's tire jack (which was small enough to get under the car) and then replace it with the tire jack from my pickup to get it high enough to get over the stands.  The oil filter is at the back of the engine and not easy to get at; which is probably why the old filter, which was on there when I bought it, was so loose.  

For a small car there is plenty of leg-room in both the front and the back.  I have to admit that after traveling in a minivan for the last several years it seems to be lacking in cargo space, but the difference in gas mileage was a nice surprise.  We got 29 mpg on the highway with the lowest grades/octanes of gasoline.  

Summary:  If you like to tinker with cars you'll probably never get the chance.  It's probably worth paying the charge at Billy's Lube Bay.  If you occasionally take long trips alone or with a partner, you'll enjoy this car.  If you take trips with a whole family, you'll need to pack carefully (you can't bring the kitchen sink).  <br><br>
