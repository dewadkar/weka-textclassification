            So my fiance wanted a new car. I'd had three Saturns before and she hadn't. She was looking at Jeep Liberty, Dodge Intrepid, Nissan Maxima. I suggested we take a look at Saturn.

The Saturn in-store and buying experiences are usually top-notch; they know their customers and they don't jerk them around. I haven't heard of anyone -- nor have I had myself -- having a better experience at any other new car dealership without dropping atleast $40 large (and for $40 large they better give me lunch.) So, Saturn wins here.

I've read some reviews of a little sloppy fit and finish, noisy cabin, awkward placed controls, cramped spaces, etc., and I have to disagree. Here's why:

The fit and finish looked fine; I didn't see any gaps between pieces and nothing that looked cheap and cheasy. Paint finish is even, body panels match the contour, doors and windows seal well. What are you other reviewers looking for?

A friend of mine recently bought an Infiniti I35. He won't say how much he paid (he's weird about money; likes to spend it, let people know he spends a lot, but won't really come clean on exact amounts) but I'm sure it was atleast $35,000 (but he's a sales guy too so, he knows how to haggle 'em down, right?)

Why do I mention this? Because for his over $10,000 more than we paid he got what? No sunroof, music system that sounds a little better (but he has not taste in music so it's not like the passengers get to enjoy it), a little more room in the back seat (but how often is anyone else really back there anyhow?) seats that are a little more comfortable, and an Infiniti nameplate.

Wow.. all that for only $10,000 more... what a bargain. But, he says, it will hold it's value better than our Saturn. Tell you what, you buy two Infinitis over ten years and well buy two Saturns over ten years and lets see who has spent more. But if you feel like you got your moneys worth hey... why not send your hard earned cash offshore anyhow... I hear the Japanese economy is down as well...

Anyhow...

Noisy cabin? Not much more noisier than most other cars in its price range but I guess I don't have that fine tuned an ear. And when I put the pedal to the metal I do hear the engine. But then, unless you are driving that I35, how often are you flooring it and then braking? Nevermind; I've seen some of you other drivers out there...

Ok, pretty much all the controls are in the middle except the side mirrors. Unless you plan on getting exercise by changing hands to operate controls frequently, who cares? I like having everything in the middle: My left hand stays on the wheel. My right hand is free to operate windows, adjust the stereo, open the sunroof, wave at passing cars with one finger... you get the idea. Besides, if you are doing one of those quick in-and-out stops, either passenger or driver (whoever gets left waiting) can open the far window to get a breeze or talk to the cop that says you can't park there.

I'm 5'11" and about 190 (a little thicker in the middle than I'd like) and my now-wife is 5'2" and pregnant. We seem to have plenty of room (she can still put her legs on the dash) and have made several 5 hour trips to see her family in this car. The only cramping you might have is in the back seat when the front seats are all the way back. Hey! This isn't a bus! My view on back seats is like an extra bed in our apartment for company; you want it to be comfortable for a short period of time so as to encourage people to move on. Besides, with the number of cars sold in the US, most people either have one or they live deep enough in a city where you don't want to use one anyhow.
Then again, I am not to fond of the I35 drivers method of driving... We'll take our car and follow you!

So, as you can plainly see, the Saturn is the best car (I embillish.)

Ok, maybe not the best car but, for under $25,000 you get almost 200HP, leather, heated seats and mirrors, powerwindows/locks/sunroof/driver seat, 6-cd indash Infiniti speakers, low maintenance, and no haggling.

I'm sure I left some other things out but, hey, I'm not paid to do this and I don't consider myself a professional.
My real goal was jsut to cover a couple of things that I keep finding in other reviews. Just like Saturn, this review was meant to be different.

Oh, and btw, go to http://www.onelapofamerica.com/ and see for yourself how a meager SC1 beat out a Trans Am, several 325i's, an M3, a bunch of 911's, a 930 and some 944's (I guess Porches aren't what they used to be). An ECONO class car beat SSGT1's, SSGT2's and MidPri Sedans?

Wow... I guess that extra $10,000 doesn't go as far as you thought...
