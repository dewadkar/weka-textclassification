            In August 1995, I purchased a 1995 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Edition.  It was the best investment that I have made.  The reason that I purchased the 1995 model over the newer model is simple. The 1995 is rugged and classic.  I don't worry if I get caught in the occasional summer rain storm.  The dash is slanted downward which allows the cassette deck to stay dry.  Also, the fluid gages are more reminiscent of the CJ7 Jeeps. The newer models have an interior which is similar to the Jeep Cherokees. Do not get me wrong, the Jeep Cherokee is a great vehicle but you would not want to get the interior wet.  Jeep Wranglers are made for just that.  They did make some important changes with the new models such as the round headlamps and moving the gas cap away from the tail light. This was the best innovation by far.  However, the newer models have paint jobs which are too trendy.  For instance, the new Jeep Wrangler Sahara edition comes in black.  Can you imagine driving a black Jeep through the Sahara desert? The Jeep Wrangler model that I own is classy enough to go an elegant event which has valet parking however sporty enough to take it mud hopping or through several inches of snow. I do not get that feeling with the newer Jeep models. However, compared to the other &quot;wanna be&quot; Jeep products on the market, it is still better.<br><br>
