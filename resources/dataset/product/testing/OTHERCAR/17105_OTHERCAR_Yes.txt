            I bought this car last summer and it has been great. The seats are very comfortable and the acceleration is great. The only complaint I have is that the cup holders only hold soda cans, other than that it is a fantastic car. It has a lot of room in the back seat for my three kids. They love to ride in it. It is also somewhat affordable at just under 50 grand. I never thought Mercedes would make an SUV, none the less a successful one! If your looking for a Sports Utility Vehicle this is the way to go. Thanks for reading my opinion and check out my other opinions!<br><br>
