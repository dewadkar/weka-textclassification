            This is my first opinion on this site, so please, pardon my errors.

I purchased the car brand new in May, 1996.  I also purchased a 100,000 mile, 7 year warranty for $600.00.  The company that backed the warranty paid out over $2,000.00 on my car before the warranty ran out last year.  I had problems with the seat belts.  They retract when I slow down for turns and will not loosen so I can look for oncoming traffic.  That was the first and smallest problem.

Problems that I have been told by the dealerships (yes, more than one) that do not exist or cannot be repaired:
1.  'Thunk' noise from passenger/rear of vehicle at turns, bumps and potholes.  My passengers have heard this, but the service departments are unable to recreate it.  This has occurred since day one, and gets louder as mileage increases.
2.   Brakes squeal.  I have been told that this is due to metallic pads.  Why is this not occurring with other makes and models?
3.   Engine noise.  Idles loudly.  Turn on heater and the engine gets loud enough to interfere with the radio.
4.   Driver side window.  This has always been loose.  If the window is cracked open, it will rattle with every bump or hole in the road.  This, too, gets worse with age.
5.   Engine knocking on start up.  If the car sits for any period of time (48 hours when this happened) the oil drains (???) or settles, causing the engine to knock on start up.  After a tow (AAA) and compression test, was told to let the engine warm up and the noise will vanish.
6.   Heater.  I work in Western New York.  It takes at least 15 minutes for the heater to actually heat if the outdoor temperature is below 30 Degrees Fahrenheit.  When the temperature nears the Zero mark, add another 5 - 10 minutes.  If you are considering this car, get a remote control starter.  They are available for standard transmissions.

Repairs that have been made on my car that cost over $100 include:
1.  Head Gasket.  I have done some research on this and I am lucky.  I have found a lot of owners who have had to replace this more than once.  My warranty covered it.  If you are persistent, Chrysler or the dealership might (and might not) help pay for this job that starts at $600.
2.  Radiator.  This is a base model Neon w/o air conditioning, therefore the radiator job cost $500.  I did a lot of research before authorizing this.  I was able to get it done cheaper, but the part is about $300 and not available at part store near me.  
3.  A valve and a couple other engine problems.  A compression test improved the gas mileage.  Do not know why.

There are more problems, but you should have an idea of what this car will actually cost you by now.  I have had to rent a car three times while my car was in the shop.  Read your warranty carefully.  The loaner car ploy  is what sells, it does not exist for many of us. 

THE PLUS SIDE (Does Exist!!)
Manual transmission - 115,000 miles and (knock on wood) not doing poorly.
For a four cylinder, the pickup is pretty good, usually.  May be due to the fact that it is a stick shift.
I can pack a lot of camping gear in the trunk.  The back seat is very roomy.  I do not have a problem with child seats or large coolers.
The original exhaust is still on the car.  Minor repairs hardly ever occur.
No rust, paint is in good condition.

My overall opinion is that someone living paycheck to paycheck and trying to better their life should stay away from this vehicle.  New drivers should avoid this car, in the driveway and on the road.  Neon drivers are surrounded by blind spots.  I am looking forward to the final payment (two more to go!!!!!!).
