            My wife and I recently bought a 2000 Honda Accord EX-V6 with all the bells and whistles (sunroof, home link, leather, CD player, automatic temperature control, AND NEW FOR 2000 SIDE IMPACT AIR BAGS).  I would recommend this car to anyone who would like a reliable, well built car. 

We were looking for a well made, reliable car.  The Honda Accord EX-V6 certainly fits that bill.  If you are looking for a midsize car I�m sure you also looked at the Passat and Camry.  My wife really liked the Passat until we got to the price $$$$$.  Now I can look back and see that I actually think the Honda Accord has more style to its shape than the Passat.  Another drawback of the Passat is it requires high-octane fuel while the Honda does not.  It saves you a few extra dollars a fill-up.  The Camry isn�t as large or attractive as either.

We also considered the Accura TL similar to the Accord, but about $5,000 more.  There were not any advantages to paying that premium so the Accord fit the bill perfectly.

Ease of buying:

Another Honda advantage is the ease of selection.  If you want the sunroof, as we did, it jumps you to the EX.  In fact for the EX-V6 there were exactly ZERO choices to make.  All you did was pick the color and you were done.  None of that messing around with choices of fabrics, do I want this or that.

Price:

Amazingly enough the fully loaded car CAN be bought for under $23,000.  The dealer invoice is $22,251 if I remember correctly and most dealers wanted anywhere from $24,000 to $28,000.  With a quick quote for carsdirect.com they were offering the car for $22,500.  With that leverage I was able to buy the car for $22,300.  

I laugh at my neighbors who paid upwards of $30,000 for �better named� cars, but didn�t receive any additional benefits for their car.

Summary:

All in all the Honda Accord has been a great purchase and with how well Honda keeps their value and works forever I expect to keep the car for a long time.
