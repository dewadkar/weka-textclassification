            Hello all you car fans. If you are looking to buy a used car then I would HIGHLY suggest a Chevrolet Cavalier. I have had my 1987 cavalier for two years and have not had to replace or repair one thing on it! It has got us through some good times and has started every morning whether it be snowing, pouring, below 0 or scalding hot. It has been so reliable to our family that I would not trade my car in for anything.
I know you all must be wondering why I called my title &quot;MY BEAST&quot; and I will tell you why I did that. It has stuck by me all this time and it is gonna end up out lasting any car on this planet. 
If I had to buy another car, I would buy another Cavalier cause it is my favorite car and they are so very reliable!<br><br>
