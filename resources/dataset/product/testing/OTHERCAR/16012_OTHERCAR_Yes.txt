            The 2001 Toyota Camry is a pretty well rounded car, for 20,000. My family just bought one a few months ago, its really nice. The ride is smooth and very comfortable. Although it looks like a regular car, the ride is great. 
The car has great space and interior features. Cd rom player, cup holders, the usual features. 
Toyota has been one of my top car companies. They usually last a long time. For some reason, our camry makes a wierd sound when braking, probably wet brakes or something, but all else is fine. Its not really fast when you accelerate, even when you step on the pedal, but considering it a family car, and its really good mileage per gallon, it'll save you a couple of bucks for gas. (This car will be good for the upcoming gas inflation prices) The car usually drives for a couple of weeks without refill, depending on how far you drive and how fast. Overall, the camry is a great car, economically speaking, and if you are looking for an affordable family car, you should try the camry out. Another option is the 2001 Honda Accord, but pretty much Honda's and Toyota's are great for Japanese car companies.
