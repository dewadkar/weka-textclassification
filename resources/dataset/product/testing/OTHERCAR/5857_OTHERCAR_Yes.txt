            ****************Updated 12/21/2001********************* 

Below is my original review followed by the update.

What else can I say that anyone hasn't? I'll try. I start with why I bought this car. I recommended this car in '99 to a friend, who bought one. I've been shopping this car since then but my '93 Acura Vigor was refusing to give me a reason for getting rid of it (see my post from last year). It was refusing until about a month ago when I inexplicably blew the tranny (it had 111,000 miles). Dealer wanted $3,200 for a remanufactured unit. My uncle is a mechanic and his cost to have it rebuilt was $1,400. We decided to just find a used transmission. We found one from a wrecked Vigor which only had 30K miles for about $750. My uncle didn't charge me for removal and installation. This is extremely rare for a Honda product, so I figured I was one of those rare statistics. Lucky me. I was also noticing rust was starting to take hold around the rear wheel wells which is typical of that model. I figured I would drive it another year, and save up for the down payment for a new TL next year, since my Vigor would be worth much less.

Then it happened. I was in a dealership waiting for an oil change and there it was, a White Diamond Pearl w/NAVI. Surprisingly, the dealer was willing to deal a little. They offered me a decent deal on my Vigor and knocked about $1,300 off the sticker on the TL. I thought I could do better and walked out. I quickly found out that the 2001 TLs were pretty much sold out of the Chicago area, and all there was to be had were 2002s, selling at sticker. Sticker and a waiting list for some of the 2002 Type-S models.  I called around and found only one other dealer in the Chicago area that had a White Diamond Pearl TL w/NAVI. Went to that dealer and told them I wanted them to knock at least $2K off the sticker and do a little better on my trade(never really believing they would), they said they couldn't, but relented after I started walking out the door, much to my amazement. There I was, I just bought a new car.

Now for the car. There is no way you can find another car that gives you all of the toys in this car and still stay under $30K (before taxes). There are even features that aren't covered in the manual, such as retained power for up to ten minutes after you shut the car off. Useful when you realize you didn't shut those rear windows or the sunroof isn't completely closed. I have only had this car for a week, but I am truly impressed. The engine is whisper quiet and will plant you back in the seat when you punch the "go" pedal. The Navigation system is truly amazing and ranks high in the electronics geek factor category. It's integrated well with the radio by lowering the volume as a turn comes up, gives you the directions, then restores your stereo to your previously set volume. For those who say they will never use it, I say you don't know what your missing until you have it. I was caught in a traffic jam, but didn't know if cutting through a subdivision would lead me to a dead end. I just flipped on the NAVI and instantly I had a map of the subdivision that was on my left and I quickly navigated my way out of the jam. Not to mention never having to get directions again. The updated DVD comes out once a year, but they're a little pricey ($150), but then again, I don't think you need to update it every year.

Fit and finish are flawless as we've come to expect in Honda/Acura products. Handling is exceptional, people comparing this to a BMW need to remember this is still a front-driver, and it's at least $10,000 less than a comparably equipped 3 series. I've also shopped the Lexus ES 300 and I must say that a comparably equipped model lists on the up side of $35K, and you still don't get a NAVI. Delete the NAVI and you're saving even more with the same features. The styling is a little bland, but that stealthiness could prove beneficial as your storming through traffic and your local law enforcement is prowling for BMWs and Audis. With two kids, the back seat is a little tight, but much better than my old Vigor. 

People have said that the Maxima is cheaper. Last I checked, a loaded Maxima SE was stickering for close to $30K, and a NAVI isn't available. Now Nissan may be knocking a bit off the price of a Maxima, but then your still in the same price range as a TL w/o a NAVI.

In summary, this car offers the best mix of luxury and sport, but absolutely blows the doors off of the competition when it comes to value and content. Especially when you consider that when I bought my Vigor in '93, it was stickering for $28K, although the discounts were quite a bit deeper for that car.

The 2002s offer a few more features, memory seats, fog lights, revised grill. But for now, you'll pay sticker. Want more? Buy the Type-S and you'll get 260HP (vs. 225), Vehicle stability control, firmer suspension, and bigger wheels. You'll also have to shell out a couple thousand bucks more, which begins to close the price gap between the 3 series Beemers and may make the TL less of a bargain.

Lastly, the TLs have an amazing ability at retaining their value. My friend's '99 TL w/only 10K miles is still values at $27K. 

I'm looking forward to at least another 111,000 miles in my TL.

Best of luck!

****************Update  12/21/2001**************************

After seven and a half months I figure I would give a quick update. I'm even more pleased with my purchase. The manual recommends not really pushing this car until you've put on 600 miles. Once I surpassed that mark, I started to test this car more. The acceleration is impressive, but the fact that it does it in such a refined manner is even more impressive. The ride is firm but not too firm with very little road noise. The climate control works flawlessly and the gas mileage is not out of the ordinary. I've gotten around 22-24mpg on a mix of highway city. You have to make sure the A/C is off in order to get into the mid to upper twenties range.

I haven't driven a 2002, but if there have been over "500 refinements made over the 2001", they've made a great car even better.

A few issues I have with complaints I read (not all necessarily on this site):

Gas mileage: Some have complained that gas consumption is too high. I've been driving a mix of city and highway and getting about 22 mpg. Not bad for an engine that hasn't even really been broken in yet. If you want more, go buy a Honda Civic. This car is in the same class as the Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30 and other "near-luxury" models. You rarely hear those owners complaining about gas mileage.

"Not as good as a BMW 3-Series": Again comparing the proverbial apples to oranges. This is a front wheel drive car that should be compared against the aformentioned ES300 and I30, in addition to cars like the Mitsubishi Diamanti. The TL may give the 3-Series a fight in straight-line acceleration (depending on the engine in the BMW), but that's where the comparison should end. A more accurate comparison for the BMW may be the Lexus IS300 - both rear wheel drive cars. If you're comparing the overall package (value, performance, space, content), the TL puts up a good fight on the BMW depending on which of those items is of higher priority to you. Remember a comparably equipped 3-Series will cost you close to $10k more and has less interior space than the TL.

It all comes down to your priorities. If you want flat out performance in a rear wheel drive car, look at the BMW 3-Series, Lexus IS-300, or maybe even a "stripped down" Lexus GS-300. If you want more room, more content, near comparable acceleration while sacrificing some extreme handling ability and saving close to $10K, then definitely take a look at this car.

Complaints after 9K miles. Slight steering wheel vibration when braking, this was a known TL problem in late '01/early '02 models. It was resolved at the first oil change by  resurfacing the rotors and replacing the front brake pads. I also had a problem early on with the wipers smudging really bad. It seems as though some TLs left the factory with washer fluid that had a high alchohol content. This caused the wipers and the winshield washer tubing to break down. This was resolved during the same trip that the brakes were fixed, it involved flushing the fluid and replacing the tubing and the wiper blades. Owners of newer models probably won't experience the problem with the brakes and wipers.

Other nit picking: The screen of the navigation system is difficult to see with the sunroof open on a sunny day. Wish it had a real parking brake (hand operated instead of foot operated). That's it.

After all this time I love my car even more than the day I bought it.
