            This camera is a sweet piece of hardware, capable of capturing still or moving images.  Controls are confusing at first, but after giving the manual a once over the camera becomes very user friendly.  This camera has many features for everyone.  One feature I like is taking a still picture while recording your voice, allowing the user to explain the situation you are capturing.  

People who send pictures through emails can switch the camera from normal picture taking to email picture taking.  This reduces the quality of the picture, but also decreases the amount of memory needed to save and send the picture.  This results in a faster send (some email hosts won't send files larger than a certain amount) and requires less space on your computer. Not that you need use the valuable memory on you computer, because the camera acts as one more CD-rom drive than you already have.  You can load images and movies directly from your camera without having to save anything but the camera's USB driver (a USB connection is required to connect to your computer and the cord is included).  

The MVC-CD200 can also be switched to the highest quality which is 1600 x 1200.  In this mode you can take approximately 237 standard quality photos or 132 fine quality photos.  As you lower the image size you can save more pictures (in 1024 x 768 you can get up to 500 standard quality photos).  Pictures are crystal clear, even in complete darkness, thanks to the pop-up flash and the AF illuminator.  

Two CD's are included in the box, one CD-R and one CD-RW which both hold 156 MB of memory.  The CD-R does not gain more memory after you delete images or movies, but the CD-RW does.  CD-Rs cost 19.95 for a 5 pack and each CD.  The 64 MB memory card I saw cost $119.00 and can't even hold as much memory as one CD-R.  Also in box was an AC adapter, a battery, a USB cord, shoulder strap, camera lens cover, and a cord that allows you to view images on your TV.  

The cost for the camera was steep, but I figured the savings of the memory card and film development cost would help pay for the camera.  I'm afraid your going to have to buy a digital photo printer to print photo-lab quality prints, but if you can settle for paper prints and you want to send pictures and movies through the internet, this digital camera is for you.
