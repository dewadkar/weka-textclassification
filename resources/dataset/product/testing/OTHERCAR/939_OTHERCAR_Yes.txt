            Toyota Sienna CE, 2001

Big Improvement

For 2002 consumers are offered the Sienna in 3 different trims. The CE, which is the basic model, then the upscale LE and the very upscale LXE.

Regardless of which trim you select, the people at Toyota have come up with two major improvement for the Sienna 2002. The first is variable valve timing with intelligence or VVT-i, this advanced system has been incorporated to the engine and it gives it a 1 horsepower boost over last year model.

The second one is Toyota vehicle skid control or VSC which when combined with the brakes anti-lock system will help prevent over and under steering.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The model I test drove was the basic CE trim. It comes equipped with very few standard comfort features.

Nevertheless the Toyota Sienna is a very stylish passenger van, it will give you comfortable drive within city streets but it is at its best on highway.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Even in the basic CE trim the interior of the Sienna is impeccable. All the material that Toyota uses is of first quality and the workmanship is superior.

Once behind the steering you will have an excellent front view and the side view mirrors are large enough to also give the driver a good vision of on coming traffic with a minimal blind spot. A word of caution if it is your first time driving a van be careful while backing up, it can be harder to estimate the distance than in a car.

From the driverï¿½s seat all the gauges are easy to see and the control buttons are also easy to see and reach. I did find the climate control system a little hard to understand at first but eventually I did catch on.

The front will give both the driver and passenger lots of head and legroom, while in the second row the headroom is the same as for the front but the legroom is at a premium, in the third row the legroom is very restricted.

The third row is a 50/50 slit arrangement and it will move forward by six inches to allow for more cargo space.

The CE trim comes with very few standard features, but more can be purchase by adding feature package. The Sienna I drove was very basic it had the following equipment: air conditioning, tilt steering, AM/FM radio cassette, CD changer and a rear window defroster.

The exterior:

I really do like the styling of the Sienna, of course this is a matter of personal taste but I think that as a whole this van is beautiful.

The cargo volume is at 17.9 cubic feet and can be increased by moving the third row seat assembly forward by a full six inches.

The standard towing capacity is at 3,500 pounds.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Toyota Sienna CE I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 3-liters, V-6 motor that will develop 210 horsepower at 5800 RPM.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: Front disc and rear drums with Abs.
Tires: 205/70R15
Safety: Dual front airbags.
           Child safety locks.
           Vehicle skid control system.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Toyota Sienna is a very comfortable van to drive, more so on the highway were it will give you a very smooth ride.

I think Toyota is going a little too far with their option package program, at the price the car and van are selling the base models should have more standard features.
