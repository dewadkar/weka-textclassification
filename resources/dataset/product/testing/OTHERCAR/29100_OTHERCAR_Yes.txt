            As a very picky consumer, I did some major research to decide what type of truck I wanted to spend my hard earned cash on and the Toyota Tocoma 4x4 is hands down the best!
I bought my Truck in July of 99 as a 1999 Model year.
Its a fully loaded Tacoma 4x4 ext. cab with the TRD package.
Its got everything that i wanted in a truck and more.
Here were I live (Michigan) we have some harsh winters and the 4x4 does wonders in the snow.  My version came with the 3.4 litre V6 with 190 HP and 220 ft/lbs of torque. It has a 5 speed manual transmission, Button operated locking rear differential, Auto engage front hubs, 31x10.5 goodyear all terrain tires, off road package with Bilsteen gas shocks, HD suspension. and so on...
THe cab is very quiet and roomy, The rear cab is adequate for kids but can be hard on adults in long distance travels.
The stock Stereo has nice features but I upgraded the Stereo system.
The ride can be harsh sometimes but hey! its a truck and not a SUV.
The instrumentation is easy to read and simple.
The Power from the 3.4 litre is awesome! Gas mileage is somewhat expected.
I usually get around 15-18 mpg.
From what I heard about Toyota's Quality and from my own experience in having Toyota vehicles, Its the best quality small truck you can get.
I have test driven many trucks to get my final conclusion and by far the Toyota has the best feel and quality to back it up in my book

After putting 52,000 miles on the truck, here is what I have to tell so far...

The gas mileage has improved with age on this truck.  I get around 20-22 mpg on the average.
The ride on my truck is still the same. For a truck, its expected. When I drive on very bad roads here in Michigan at high speeds, I get some wheel hop. With the TRD package, it includes heavy duty suspension (Bilsten shocks).
The HD suspension will be a plus when I take it off road.

The only problem I had with my truck is the passenger seat will not move forward when you pull on the seat lever to gain access to the rear cab. I haven't had the time to take it to the dealer to get it fixed or replaced but its not that much of a hassle to me.
The power of this 3.4 litre still keeps me impressed. It has more torque than my older 350 chevy V-8 Blazers that i owned in the past.

All in all, I am completely satisfied with my Toyota and will buy another one IF my truck dies.
