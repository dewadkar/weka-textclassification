            The one thing I can say about the Seville STS is that it is a great car for the money. My Seville is now 8 years old and it does not fail to attract great comments from friends and family. I was hesitant to buy the Seville because I always associated Cadillac being an old man's car but  my friends that are in the automotive business in their mid 20's recommended the STS. I was looking at Lexus and Acura instead but found that the Seville offers a lot of the same performance for a lot less money. The appearance is great and has a European look to it. The interior is the most comfortable that I have ever rode in. Passengers love the leg room both front and back. As for for the ride, it is a bit on the harsh side. The ride is not the usual ride on clouds as Cadillac is known for; however,the suspension does make up for it on its performance handling. The Seville handles through turns very smoothly and with good precision.  The car is making some weird sounds that are getting stronger with time. There is also an oil burning smell beginning to form that is coming from the engine compartment. The car only has 68K so these sounds and smells are beginning to worry me. Cadillac has had a reputation for being unreliable in the past;yet, it has been getting great reviews about its reliability improving over time but these sounds and smells does make me question the reliability of the Seville. Parts are very expensive especially suspension parts. Overall, I am well pleased with my car and enjoy it very much.<br><br>
