            When this car first came out, I was attracted by its beautiful lines and attractive features.  I test drove it with a V6 engine and was sold.  The handling is silky smooth and just melts into those tricky corners and though the V6 is not as smooth as the Japanese Imports in its class, it gives out a roar to let all know that this baby's got North American power to leave the pretenders behind in the dust. (Only the Beamers, Benz and Audis have whipped my butt so far). If you're thinking of a Honda or Toyota or Nissan or some import, check out the Alero. It's definitely sexier than most in its class, the V6 has got bite, and lots of value for the buck.  <br><br>
