            I bought the fuji mx-700 in July. I am a graphic designer and am tired of scanning and using someone elses images.  This camera has been nothing but wonderful. It sits in my car and is used almost everywhere I go, be it for work purposes or for pleasure. I bought an extra 8 mb flash card so i will never run out of memory for pictures. The resolution is excellent as is the printout of the pictures using a color printer.  Another great feature on this camera is its sequence shot capabilities. One can take a sequence shot of eight or sixteen pictures in two or four seconds. Its great for action shots. I have been taking these sequence shots and animating them in adobe image ready. (making little movies).

The camera is great, has lots of potential. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera. Battery lasts for a long time as well.<br><br>
