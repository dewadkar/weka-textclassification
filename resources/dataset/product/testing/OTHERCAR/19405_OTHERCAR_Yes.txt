            We start shopping around for cars last year after my husband's car broke down. I was using a Honda Civic at the time and was very pleased with the performance. When we were in the Honda dealer, we realized Honda CR-V was a nice looking car..We didnt think that we can afford it. We were wrong. The price was very reasonable for all that you get. OK. It is a little small looking compared to other SUV's but hey the price is so much smaller too. 

We have been using the car for almost a year now and absolutely love it. The price was very affordable, and inside of the car is quite roomy. The picnic table that it has to cover the spare tire came in soo handy many times.. (believe me, when we were buying the car, we had laughed to that idea! but it turned out to be a very good one)

We are having a baby now and the car definetly has enough room for all those baby stuff. We also used it a lot for carrying furniture without any problems. The back seats reclines all the way, allowing a larger trunk. This ability also makes the passengers sitting at the back very comfortable too. Driving the car is really smooth. It is not soo big that you get scared of driving the car (most women have that fear with big cars). 

If you are planning to have a family this car can serve you very well. It is easy to drive. ( I am 7 months pregnant, and I can only drive our CRV!!)
