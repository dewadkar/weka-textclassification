            In November of 1994 the time had come to replace the reliable yet extremely ugly 1984 Ford. Being 6'5&quot; tall any cars mid size and smaller were not acceptable for any driving other than a couple miles.

After looking at the Cadillac's and Mercury's I discovered the new 1994 Chrysler LHS. This car seemed to good to be true a luxury car with all the options stock.

My initial image was of a large car with sleek lines for 1994. The interior has leather seating capable of seating five with three across the spacious  back seat. The front bucket seats have electric adjustment and seemed very comfortable. The console has a leather covered automatic shift and CD storage compartment. The dash board is nicely laid out and provides eye contact with all the instrumentation and stereo components. The very large trunk easily holds baggage for a family of four and contains a FULL size spare tire. The six cylinder engine has plenty of pick-up considering the size of the car. After a test drive I felt I had found my dream car, luxury at an affordable price. 

When I bought the car I decided to buy an extended warranty. I knew it was most likely money poorly spent but I bought it anyway.

I have now owned the car for five years and while the car still looks nice on the exterior , I have since decided the extended warranty was the best purchase I made that day. 

Here is a list of issues I have had with this car. While this list may not be indicative of all Chrysler LHS models I have spoken with many and there seems to be a pattern, and not just with the LHS model.

1. Drivers side seat belt stopped retracting.
2. Moon roof did not seat tight allowing the wind to whistle through. The roof liner had to be removed to repair.
3. Lighter burned out.
4. At 40 k miles the transmission let go. Happened on the interstate in the middle of the night. 
5. Water pump replaces.
6. Oil pump replaced.
7. Front end has a rattle I have to have checked out.
8. Gas gauge does not work properly.
9. While this may be normal wear and tear the wiper blades wear out quicker than any car I have ever owned.
10. At 82K the transmission went for a second time!
11. The ABS system causes the steering wheel to shimmy. The actual brakes seem to work fine. 

There are probably some other things I chosen to forget but you can get the idea.

While the Chrysler's have nice looks the mechanics are lagging. I would be very careful in purchasing a used LHS.   <br><br>
