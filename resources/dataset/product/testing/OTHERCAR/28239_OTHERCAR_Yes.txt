            I couldn't do it.  I just couldn't bring myself to buy a mini van.  Not that mini vans aren't great, but they just say &quot;mom&quot; all over them, and even though I am a mom, I wanted something FUN to drive too.  My choice - a new flame red 1999 Dodge Durango SLT.

ROOMY

The Dodge Durango is fabulous when it comes to roominess in an easy to drive package.  I had never owned a truck before and was petrified to even test drive the SUV's; and I really did not want an SUV that would only seat 4 people. . .my sedan did that perfectly well and handled like a dream.  I needed BIG. The Dodge was not so big that I was afraid to drive it, but can seat 7 people.  Well, if the 7 people are little.  Realistically, it seats 5 adults and three children if everyone wants to be comfortable.  The fold away seat in the back is shorter as measured from your back to your knees so for some adults it just won't be comfortable.  

EASY TO CONFIGURE

The seating arrangements can be changed in a snap. Need more room.  Just flip a lever or pull a handle and the seats reconfigure.  It takes seconds to do this and no upper body strength whatsoever.

GAS MILEAGE BITES

Not much to say here. I probably average 14 MPG (very little highway driving).

PLASTICKY INTERIOR/MINOR REPAIR ISSUES

If I had to lodge one complaint is that I do get the feeling that this vehicle is not the all time highest quality item.  My basis of comparison is two Japanese cars which NEVER were in the shop for anything but service.  In a year, my Dodge Durango had a problem with the power window on the drivers side (it wouldn't roll down).  Then, one day I pulled on the parking brake release(kind of a plastic handle) and the whole handle snapped in half in my hand. Finally, the parking brake release sticks and must be released two times before you can drive.  

To be honest, these things have only diminished my enthusiasm a little bit.  I still really enjoy driving this puppy.

HANDLES WELL BUT NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO TAILGATE

I enjoy how the Dodge handles.  It corners well and has little body lean.  But, it does not &quot;stop on a dime&quot;.  You need to brake well in advance of your stop . . . unless you enjoy driving over the subcompact in front of you.

BAD WEATHER; NO PROBLEM

I live in the snowiest city in the U.S. (well this year anyway) - Rochester, NY.  This SUV handles even the snowiest roads very well. 10-12 inches of snow was no problem even before the roads were cleared.

LOVE THE LOOKS

Of course this part is personal.  I love the look of the Dodge.  Strong, spirited, and sleek - - definitely NOT a mini van.  Judging from the gazillion compliments and comments I have received on this vehicle, others agree. Particularly men seem to just love the look of this car.  It is a definite conversation starter.

SUMMARY

Great looks and roomy interior make this SUV a natural for anyone who needs a large vehicle. But watch out for nuisance repairs - - you need to love the positives to compensate for the minor annoyances.
