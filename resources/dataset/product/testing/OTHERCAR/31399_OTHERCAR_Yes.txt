            This is an all-around great car.  It replaced a 1996 VW Jetta, and it's safe to say the Alero is twice the car that thing was (for only a grand more!)

It's the perfect compromise between performance and class.  I shopped a wide variety of vehicles to replace the Jetta, and this car struck me as an incredible bargain.  Fun to drive, yet with luxury-car amenities.  

The only hints that the car cost less than $30,000 is some wind noise (un-noticeable if you have the radio on), and slightly dodgy inside door 'bar' you use to open and close the door.

If you're looking for a barcolounger on wheels, this is *not* your car, but I would suggest taking a serious look if you enjoy fast driving, want modern amenities, but don't want to spend $40,000 for a BMW.<br><br>
