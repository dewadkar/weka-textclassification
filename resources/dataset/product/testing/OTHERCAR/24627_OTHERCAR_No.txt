            I originally went with this car because of several reasons.  It has power, providing the driver with an 227hp engine, as well as a reasonable feeling of luxury and comfort.
In fact, when driving this car, you will not be disappointed with its stability and response on the road.  Its interior is of high quality and makes you feel at home.  However, neither will it surprise you.  After several weeks of driving this car I found myself wondering why one would opt for this more costly model instead of its nissan maxima cousin.  Based on the same platform, these two are very similar in power and handling, and I in fact felt that the maxima had better acceleration.  I also found that for something that is also supposed to be sporty, that you are sitting too high in the seat, and I am not really tall (5'11&quot;), and this feeling very much removes you from feeling the road.  I believe that you can only separate the two by choosing the I30t which provides you with a firmer more responsive suspension and a better road feel.
Overall, I think that when looking at this car you should also consider the Acura 3.2TL which is much more sporty while being just as (if not more luxurious) and faster, or the Lexus ES300, which is less sport and much more luxury-oriented, isolating you from the outside world and providing a very quite comfortable environment.<br><br>
