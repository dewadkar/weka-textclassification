            I bought my Subaru Legacy Wagon in the Summer of '98, and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's incredibly reliable, and probably one of the best decisions that me and my parents have made.  My Subaru is the first car that I've had, and I'm going to be very spoiled because of it...no other car will be able to compare.  Since we've had so much snow lately, my car is the one that everyone uses, because it drives the best in the snow.  It's awesome in bad weather.  The car may be 10 years old, but it drives like it's new, and I never feel safer than when I'm driving it.  We bought it used from a dealer, and we've haven't had any problems with it.  I would recommend this car to just about anyone.  Since it drives well in the snow, I would tell anyone that lives somewhere where there's a lot of snow or rain.  Also, it's safe, which makes it perfect for someone that has children, or is worried about feeling safe and in control while they're driving.  Since it's a wagon, anyone that travels often, or students that go back and forth to school would find it to be a good car.  The only people that I wouldn't recommend it to are those that want something more sporty, or that are in search of a small car.  The fact that it's a wagon means that it's pretty big, and not really the sportiest car in the world.<br><br>
