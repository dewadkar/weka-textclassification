            There was no listing for 2001 Models, so I posted here.  I bought a 2001 Accord EX 5-sp, and I can't say enough good things about it.  The ONLY negative thing I can say (so far) is that you can't get a 5-sp with the V6.  While the V-6 EX is more powerful, and the auto tranny is excellent, I wanted a 5-sp.  I like the way you simply choose your trim level (DX, LX, EX) for the options you want.  While some people may want to tailor the car to their individual needs (ie, I want a moonroof, but not a 6 CD changer), I felt that my minimizing the options, it was easier to deal with the saleperson.  Many times (Chrysler is famous for this), there are SO MANY options, and PACKAGES, the salesperson can easily confuse you and talk you into spending way more than you wanted.

So far I LOVE everything about this car (with the exception of no 5-sp/V-6).  If I had to list negatives they would be minor:

     1. No selection in interior color.  Interior color is based on exterior color.  I would have liked Black w/ivory interior.  NO GO.  If you want Black ext., you get Grey int.  If you want Ivory int., choose Green or Red ext.

     2. EX w/o Leather has a power up/down, but manual controls for all other seat adjustments.  Strange.  Why can't I get power cloth seats?

That's it.  Minor, but no car is perfect.  I traded in a 1996 Dodge Stratus ES with 62K miles which needed a new transmission (I had already repaired a fair number of other problems).  

This car is nice as a primary car for a single person, or married with no kids.  For us it is a secondary car.  With kids, there is probably not enough room for long trips.  We use a minivan (currently Dodge, soon to be Honda) for long trips, and hauling around lots of people.

With Honda's reliability &amp; build quality, anyone looking for a mid-size car should absolutely consider the Honda.  The Toyota Camry is very nice, but not as Sporty (IMO).  The VW Passat is very nice, but has had reliability issues, and rides kind of stiff.  The Honda is a nice compromise between German stiff ride, fantastic handling and American cushion ride, numb handling.

Lastly, resale value is supurb.  1-2 year old Accords on the used car dealer lots are only $1-3K less than new ones!  WOW!  My Dodge Stratus depreciated very quickly (as is the norm for most Chryslers, Fords &amp; GM's).  Hondas depreciate ver slowly, and you can still get a fair amount for 10 years old Hondas with high mileage beacuse they tend to hold up well.
