            I bought this CAMERA about a month ago and today I can only say that I love it. It is a camera for the home user with the most features in the best price.

The pictures are magnificent, and it is very fast. You can get pictures as fast as a regular film camera. As I said it has a lot of features: macro mode, 3x optical zoom, 2x digital telephoto, panorama, a lot of different flash modes such as for red eyes, and also you can change the ISO.

It comes with an 8MB smart media card and it can take up to 64 MB. 

Although it has some disadvantages but I can live with them. The serial connection is very slow and the menu is somewhat difficult to use so you have to read the manual very carefully to find out all of the features this little camera has. Also when you use the monitor a lot it &quot;eats&quot; batteries real fast. So its recommended to buy the optional rechargeable ones.
