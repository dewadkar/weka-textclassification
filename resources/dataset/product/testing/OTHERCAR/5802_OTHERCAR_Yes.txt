            I received this as a Christmas gift in Dec 2001 (thanks Dad!) I've been using it non-stop since receiving it and now have over 4,400 digital pics saved to my hard drive. I'm sure another 1,000 or so found their way into the electronic trash.

The camera is powered by Rayovak 1600mha NiMH rechargables and pictures are stored on an aftermarket 64MB Smart Media card.

There's a ton of reviews for this product so I'll skip the regular mumbo jumbo and list my pros and cons. 

<b>Pros</b>
* Outstanding photos! This is the FIRST camera I've ever owned that has produced EXCELLENT photos. I take all of my printable photos in the highest quality JPG mode and they turn out FANTASTIC. I even printed one in poster size from Ofoto.com and you'd be hard pressed to tell if it came from a digital camera or not... at poster size! Seriously, if I had some nice backdrops, props, and lighting like a the Picture People (or Sears, or wherever you get "professional" photos taken) I think the photos taken with this camera would be as good if not better. I'm always getting comments on the quality of the photos.
* Great close ups. 90% of my photos are of my son, now 17 months old. Skin tones are good, colors seem pretty accurate, details are excellent. My first test picture was a closeup TIFF of my cat. You could see every single little hair on her little kitty face. The picture still strikes awe into those that see it. It's truly a high quality close up.
* Easy to use! I've found this super easy to use. Commonly used controls are easily accessible via buttons instead of burying into menus.

<b>Cons</b>
* The camera is admittedly big and bulky. If there was a camera that took great pictures like this, cost the same or even a little bit more, but could easily fit in my pocket I'd pick the smaller one. But I wouldn't sacrifice quality for size.
* Flash eats batteries for lunch. I take all of my pictures with the LCD and get dozens and dozens and dozens of pictures with each charge. But the flash kills the batteries very, very fast...  though I suppose this isn't a real shocker.
* After a year of pulling it in and out of my case and swapping the batteries the battery door doesn't stay shut as well as it used to. Quite often when I pull the camera from it's bag the door pops open and my batteries spring out. Nothing a piece of duct tape won't fix!  8-)
* Though I gush about the quality of the pictures and the accurate colors it does tend to oversaturate the color red. Sometimes it makes it appear a tad "neon red" instead of the "bright red" it looks like with your eye.

<b>Conclusion</b>
This camera has provided me with over a years worth of AWESOME photos. Truly, this is the best camera I've ever owned.

I'm sure it's an outdated model by now but if the price is right I'd recommend this camera for sure. As stated above if I had to replace it I'd shop for one that's smaller in size, assuming the quality was as good as this camera.

I have no complaints with this product at all, something of a rarity for me as I always find a long list of significant faults with every product.
