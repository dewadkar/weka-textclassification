            And boy did I do some searching to find it!!!  This was a major purchase for me, once in a lifetime.  So I wanted the most bang for my buck.  I think I found it.

The camera takes great pictures and has tons of features that make it worth what I paid and more.  I love being able to delete the pics that don't quite work out but that's what any digital camera can do. What makes this one special is how I play them back.  I have a home daycare so I can snap a ton of pictures every day, and run the SLIDE SHOW from this camera right into my tv for all the parents to see what their kids have done that day.  After they're done looking at them, I delete off all but the best.

I've seen lots of reviews that complain about battery life but I don't see that with this camera.  I've used it quite a bit, used the zoom, used the play back.  All those things take battery life but mine is still going strong.  And with the recharger coming with the camera, I don't ever see a problem with this.

There are two problems that I see with this camera.  Once is that the 4 meg memory stick it comes with doesn't hold very much unless you compromise the picture quality.  The other is that the LCD screen, while it does swivel back to front, doesn't tilt or give you other display options. That would really help.

Overall though, I'm more than pleased with my purchase.<br><br>
