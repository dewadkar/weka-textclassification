             POWER!  POWER!  POWER!  The ability to travel where you please is an essential part off my job. With my dodge A.K.A. The Beast, I have traveled across many mile of rough terrain, going down paths that are not even roads. The Beast took every bump, jolt, and every climb with ease. with out it I could do my job repairing relay towers in the backwoods. I've Had my Dodge for 4 months and have traveled 15,000 miles without a hitch. I highly recommend this TRUCK!!!!!!!! The seats are comfortable position and build, surpassing Chevys I've owned. Its power is amazing. I haven't found an obstacle to stop it yet. I had to rescue several other trucks from unlucky positions. I would trade The Beast for anything!!!!!<br><br>
