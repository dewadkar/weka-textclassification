            The Jeep Cherokee Sport 4WD is an excellent buy. It is one of the few SUV's that is really equipped for off road use. Its simple heavy duty design  reminds one of the way they used to build them. of course, this car is equipped with all of the modern safety features that cars of the past didn't have. The Cherokee Sport with a 4.0 litre V6 is a powerful, responsive and very quick car. In fact, one has to be careful not to take corners too swiftly, as these vehicles as well as almost all SUV's can tip over. The pickup with the V6 is quite remarkable for a 6 cylinder engine and the engine burns absolutely no oil. I had the same car in 1991 and it also burned no oil. The engines in these cars are very well made. The styling  of the Cherokee Sport hasn't changed much for a number of years, which is probably why Chrysler can offer this car for little over $20,000.
The front seats are very comfortable, the airconditioning and heat controls are very simple and well laid out, and all the power controls are very convenient. The ONLY downside of this car is the back seats. They are too small and it is very difficult for anyone who is either overweight or tall to get in. This is the same problem that I noticed on my 1991 Cherokee Sport. Mileage isnt bad - 15 or 20 mpg and it takes regular gas. 
I actually leased this vehicle for 36 months 12000 mi/yr. I pay 313.month, and that includes all maintenance, sales and excise tax. So if you want a very useful, very well made SUV on a modest budget, this is the car for you.<br><br>
