            I have a 1995 Cavalier 2D automatic - the year after they changed the styling from a box to curves.  It's a great looking car I'd highly recommend it BUT for one reason:

The engine is horrible.
The 2.2L engine of Cavaliers have a defect in that they originally were meant to put out far less horsepower.  But in GM's relentless quest to get more bang for the R&D buck, each cylinder was bored a bit wider and therefore in all a bit closer together in the engine.  Unfortunately, this meant that the barely sufficient cooling system now could barely keep up with the heat from the increased combustion, and voila, you have what my car has -

88,000 miles and my *third* head gasket has blown.  They've gone at 30,000 miles (1997), 70,000 miles (1999), and 88,000 miles (2001).  

This Cavalier was my first car, and there's no way I'll choose another GM car in the near future.  Absolutely no way.  I feel sorry for those who have entered fluffy-bunny comments like "I love this car, it's fun like me" - I can't imagine being like this car unless I had a congenital heart defect predisposing me to a heart murmur.  It just makes me sad that GM loses entry-level customers this way by making poor-quality cars at its low price end. 

Fortunately, GM has this little butt-covering extended warranty (read: too cheap to recall) on the Cavalier's cooling systems that you can find by doing a Google search.  It extends the basic warranty to 100,000 miles on the cooling system only.   It doesn't cover, say, in my case, the piston rings that warped due to the engine overheating, and therefore requires a quart of oil after 300 highway miles.

End analysis: This is a VERY risky car to buy used.  If you have to do so, but it well under 100,000 miles, so that you can feel out any defects before you have to start paying for head gaskets.
