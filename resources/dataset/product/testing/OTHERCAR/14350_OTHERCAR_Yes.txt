            I just purchased a used one in Feb. 03 with 47,000 miles on it.  I was looking for lower mileage, but when I tested it at the dealer I realized the engine and everything else was as clean as can be.  The engine is very sturdy and doesn't shake at all.  

I had a 94 Mercury Sable before so this was a major upgrade.  You really can't compare the two.  The only downside the Altima has to the Sable is the leg-room.  I'm just not as comfortable sitting in the Altima as I was in the Sable, but then again I'm 6'6"!  For the average person this doesn't really come into consideration.

This Altima has some zip to it.  It's only a 2.4 liter engine but it doesn't lack power at all.  One of the reasons I got this car was because the insurance cost will be more moderate than the cars with the bigger engines.  So I get to save money on insurance, but I don't feel like I'm driving a weak car.  The only thing that slightly bothers me is the slight hesitation coming out of first gear, but all smaller engines do this.  The average driver won't realize it anyway.

I have the GXE model and it has everything inside I need.  It's not in the luxury class, but I don't need luxury right now.  Includes auto-transmission, cd player, AC, heat, power windows & locks, cup-holders, & sunglass compartment.  Trunk has plenty of room and includes a useful cargo net.  

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  If you want reliability then stick with the Nissan brands.  The 2000 Altima is one of the best looking and reliable cars available if you are in the used car market.  With a couple of minor modifications (new stereo, tints, spoiler, rims, altezza tail lights) I will have my own unique car that will turn heads.
