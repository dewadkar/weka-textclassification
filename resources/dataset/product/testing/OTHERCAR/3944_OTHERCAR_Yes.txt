            My lease was up on my Malibu, although
my Malibu was a great car my needs turned
towards a smaller car. Being that I am a Chevy loyalist it was either the Cavalier
or Prizm. The choice was clear- the Prizm
all the way. Based upon the Toyota Corolla
(as the Prizm has the Toyota engine) you
just can't go wrong. Sad fact is, that
the 2002 Prizm is the last model year for this car. I guess not too many people know
that this car is a clone to the Toyota
Corolla, as such the Corolla outsells this
car to a 4:1 ratio, strangely it is the
almost exact same car as the Corolla.
I really like this car and for some strange
reason I look forward to driving it each day.
It gets exceptional gas mileage, I do alot
of city driving and I'm averaging a whopping
25 mpg!!!! I know when I get into the car
it will take me from point A to B with
no problem. For a small car the ride is
very smooth and quite comfortable. The
cars has really nice looks, although
Japanese in nature the car looks like a mini-
Malibu. (This to give it Chevy looks.)
I have no real gripes except that I wish the
rear seat was a bit bigger. This is a small
solid car (I just love the thunk when you
close the doors) that I know will give me
many years of low cost, reliable motoring.
If your intrested in the 2002 Toyota Corolla
and can't find one due to the new 2003 model
or want the same car with a lower price go
for a Prizm.
Update 1/8/03 - Well after nearly a year of
ownership this car has not given me one ounce
of trouble! It truly is low cost motoring.
It is so nimble at times I forget it is an
economy car. It is a shame Chevy does not produce this car anymore. If you can find
a used one go for it!   
2nd Update 8/8/03 Now after a year and half of
ownership this great little car continues to impress! Reliabilty is extremely great, as the low
cost motoring continues - nothing but gas (as economy is stingy) and periodic oil changes. Highly
recommended!!!
3rd Update 1/1/04 Still NO Problems with this car. 
Due to my heavy brake foot I
recently at 15000mi had to put
new front brakes. (Normal Maintanence). I had the car checked from road to roof,bumper
to bumper and the car is like
practically new. Thumbs still
remain very high up!!!!!!!
