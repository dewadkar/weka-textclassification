            Over 15 years ago my husband bought "us" a 35 mm camera that only a rocket scientist could operate with ease.  I used it for about a couple of months and gave up on it and switched to disposable Kodak box cameras.  I promised myself "some day" I would own a real camera.

Well, that day came about a month ago when I purchased my Canon A20.  I absolutely love it!  The Canon A20 is easy to use; just point and shoot, it's that easy.  It has a zoom lens for close-up shots and can be easily switched to create a paramonic view.  The camera comes with software and two plug in adapters, one adapter for the computer the other to for a VCR so pictures can be downloaded/viewed on the computer or to create a slide show on your television (Pssst... The kids just love the TV slide show!).

The pic card which came with the camera is suppose to hold up to 8 shots (however I've gotten 14 pics on the card).  I invested $30 to purchase a larger pic card for the camera so I wouldn't be limited in the number of pictures I can take at a given time.  The pic card can be used to store pictures, but if you have the luxury of having a large hard drive or zip drive for your computer, I recommend downloading pictures onto the computer (or a floppy) for storage.

Downloading the pictures onto my computer is quick and easy.  Pictures can be easily cropped and you can instantly view them.

Although I've read about problems with red-eye reduction, I haven't had that problem myself.  However, the camera eats batteries like crazy because of the display feature.  I highly recommend the purchase of rechargable batteries and a battery recharger.

I paid $250 for the camera and basically it came with everything I needed.  But, when you buy a new toy you know there are going to be other things you're going to want... Accessories!!!!

My Canon A20 wish list:
Camera case
Additional software for playing (still investigating which software I'd want to buy)
HP Photo printer
