            The Mazda Protege is a reliable, stylish looking compact that handles well, and keeps the driver happy with its optional manual transmission. 

The Mazda Protege is, in my opinion, the best buy for the compact class. First of all, the Protege has great safety features. Secondly, the car is just simply fun to drive (if you have the manual transmission). With an optional v-6 engine, the Protege has good speed and acceleration. 

Another thing I like about the Mazda Protege is the stylish way it looks. The newly updated look turns heads from many different people. The Protege also handles extremely well. The Protege can handle curves with speeds up to 60 miles per hour. 

The Protege is also relatively inexpensive. For around $16,000, you get great safety features, a cd-player, and more. I personally enjoyed driving the Mazda Protege, and I was impressed by its excellent handling.

The Protege is a reliable, quality-built compact with great handling for an inexpensive price.<br><br>
