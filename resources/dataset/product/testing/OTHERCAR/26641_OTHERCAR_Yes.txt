            In 1993 my husband and I had foolishly purchased a 1994 Mazda pickup (that's another opinion).  After owning this vehicle for a little over a year and hating it profusely, I begged my husband to buy me a different car.  Well, you know after only owning a vehicle for such a short time, trading it in is almost impossible.  We tried to sell it outright with no luck.  

Finally, after searching for a long time, my husband brought me home a 1992 (yes we went backward in years) Buick Regal.  I insisted on driving the car for an entire weekend to know whether I would like it or not.  Especially since I knew we would have this car for a very long time because we would be buried into it.  I also was concerned about the fact that it has rear wheel disk brakes.  My husband assured me if we continuously set the emergency brake we shouldn't have a problem.  After a full weekend of driving this car I did not want to give it back.  What a great riding vehicle.  As the saying goes, it rides like a dream. 

We still have this car and it still rides just as nice as the day we bought it.  It is now paid off and I don't want to get rid of it.  If we did it would be for another Buick Regal.  This car now has 135,000 miles on it and we have had virtually no mechanical problems with this car, other than regular maintenance things. If you want a relatively maintenance free vehicle and love a nice riding car, this is the one for you.  <br><br>
