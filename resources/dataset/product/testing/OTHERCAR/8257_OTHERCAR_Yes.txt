            I was lucky enough to test drive the Mercedes Benz S-600 the other day.  This is by far the most amazing luxurious car I've ever seen! Let alone been in.  All the standard features any car has, not to mention a built in global positioning computer!  If I was lost, the car would tell me where to go, how to get there, and how long it should take.  You've got to test drive or at least look at one of these cars to see all the features.

A smooth ride - This car hugs corners, it can go extremely fast, and because of its nice engine, it can go fast quickly! =]

If you have a lot of money (I mean a lot of money!!) to spend on a car, definitely check this one out.

Mercedes Benz will be in my dreams tonight!
