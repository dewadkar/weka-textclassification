            This is my first digital camera, but I have decades of experience with film cameras, including plenty of darkroom work and even a bit of accessory engineering (I turned a monocular into a telephoto for my Rolleiflex in the early 1960s). When I saw my brother-in-law's vacation photos -- from a CD on my computer monitor -- I was impressed. Since he seemed to be getting plenty of resolution from a 2 megapixel camera, I decided it was time I owned a digital.

After shopping the 2 megapixel range, it was clear from the feature list and price that the relatively new Fuji 2650 was the winner if it could deliver. The reviews on Epinions seemed to bear this out, so I went for it.

<b>The pros</b>

I am delighted with the features and the performance. So far, I've taken family pictures, pet pictures, and technical pictures for a web article. Photographically, the camera is a dream. Everything is automated, but there is a manual override for many of the automatic controls; just the thing for me. Usually, I'm satisfied with the auto settings, but I can exercise some creative control when I wish. The sharpness and resolution is fine. I know the books say that you want 3-4 megapixels for an 8x10 print. But I've made some 5x7 prints from this camera with detail to spare; I can't imagine an 8x10 not being really good.

It took a little while to get the feel for the menus. But once I did, it was very natural and easy. My only complaint there is that the flash options are numerous (that's <i>good</i>) and represented by non-intuitive symbols (not so good). I'll have to memorize them sometime, or put them on a card in the camera bag. Apart from this, all those features are really quite accessible.

The optics seem to be just fine. There is plenty of detail; the first day I had it I snapped a picture of my wife that she <i>hates</i> because it shows so much detail and texture in the skin. And you can see every stitch in the apron she is wearing. BTW, it has a 3x optical zoom, which is easy to use and frame. It also has a macro-lens setting, which I used easily and successfully for some technical photography.

There are features I haven't used yet, but I'm impressed with them and will definitely have a need for them this year. One of these is the ability to take short videos (no sound). I hope to work on recording golf swings with this feature; after I do, I'll return and edit this review with my experiences.

In short, the Fuji 2650 has a lot of well-engineered features in a tiny package at a very reasonable price.

<b>The cons</b>

First the biggie: I worry that it is too delicate. In the first month I had it I took it on the plane for vacation. I carried it in my carry-on briefcase. When I arrived at my destination, it would not work. I lost the use of it on that vacation. When I returned, I brought it to Fuji for warrantee repairs. There was never any question, in my mind or Fuji's, that it was not my fault. They agreed to the repairs cheerfully and politely. It took nearly a month to get back to me, but the problem is fixed. If it endures the next few months with no problems, I will return and update this review. (Done! See update below.)

A couple of small but notable other problems:

(1) It is a little too thick. I'm used to a camera with a flatter aspect ratio. This makes it difficult to put in a pocket, and may have contributed to a little jostling when it was in the briefcase on the plane.

(2) The software that comes with it is useless for anything but USB uploads. No real editing capability that I could find. Fortunately, I have a couple of good photo-editors that work very well with the JPEGs produced by this camera. The best of the lot is the freeware IrfanView; download it if you do any photo processing at all.

<b>Update</b>

It has been a couple of months now since the camera was repaired and returned. I have not seen any problems with it. It has accompanied me on a few golf trips, and survived both the trips and some jostling in the golf bag as I played. The pictures were very good -- even one or two action pictures (though action requires good timing with <i>any</i> digital camera). The snapshots of people and groups (both daylight and indoor/nighttime flash) were good, as should be expected. The large-scale landscapes were quite dramatic blown up in hi-res, so I have no doubt that 2 megapixels is enough for me.

The crew I golf with frequently carry digital cameras and post their pictures to the web afterwards. I got several comments that my pictures were head and shoulders above the usual fare; a lot of the credit must go to the Fuji 2650.
