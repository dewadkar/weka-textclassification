            In a blatant step toward hurling myself into the 1990s, I purchased a Relisys 3500 digital camera off of e-bay for just over a hundred dollars. The camera offers reasonable quality photos that can be transferred directly from the camera to your computer via a serial cable. 

While the fine mode picture quality (640x480) is pretty good for everyday photos, I wouldn't use the standard mode, which is about half the quality for anything. Using fine mode, you can get about 10 pictures on the 2MB card that is normally provided with the camera.

I would recommend buying the AC adaptor that is available especially for the Relisys cameras, because the majority of battery power is used while transferring pictures from the camera to your computer. Otherwise, without the adaptor, you will eat up 3 volt batteries like there is no tomorrow.

Overall, I would say the Relisys 3500 is an excellent choice for recreational photographers or for those who want the ease of not waiting for film to be developed. It's great for sending pictures to family at far less than the cost of higher resolution cameras that are available. However, if you are extremely adamant about high resolution photos, the Relisys may not be for you, but is a good entry level digital camera on a poor college student's price level.<br><br>
