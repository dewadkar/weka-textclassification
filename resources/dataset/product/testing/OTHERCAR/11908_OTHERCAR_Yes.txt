            When my wife and I wanted to start a small online business, we needed an inexpensive way to get photographs onto the Internet.  We shopped around and finally settled on the Agfa ePhoto 780c.   We chose this model because we were on an extremely tight budget but wanted at least the following features:  removable memory, built in flash, LCD display, 1024x768 resolution and decent editing software.  The 780c comes with a 2MB smart media card but will take up to an 8MB card. 

We found the camera in stock at our local Micro Center for $239.  The sales person talked me into trying a UMAX camera that sold for $199 on the advice that we would be much happier with it.  I thought there must have been something to it for a sales guy to point me to a less expensive camera so I gave the UMAX a try.  The camera was really easy to use but the picture quality was definitely lacking.  I ended up returning the UMAX the next day.  I decided to trust my instincts and give the Agfa a try.  Doing some surfing, we found it online for $180 so we decided to purchase it.   

A few days later it arrived in the mail and we were up and running in 15 minutes.  We were very impressed at the quality of the first pictures we took.   The pictures were bright and clear.  The camera shoots in 4 modes: 640 x 480 high compression, 640 x 480 standard compression, 800 x 600, and 1024 x 768.  With the 2MB card that gives you 96, 36, 24, or 12 pictures respectively.  We are currently using a 4MB card that doubles this capacity.  

Like all digital cameras, the batteries tend to be eaten quickly, especially if you use the LCD viewer often.  Consider using high quality alkaline batteries instead of the off brand batteries.  We have personally found that we get more mileage by using the name brand batteries such as Duracell and Energizer.

This camera has all but replaced my 35mm SLR camera.  It�s so easy to snap off pictures of the kids and instantly see how they are going to turn out.  Our parents have been getting weekly photos in their e-mail so they can keep up on how the kids are doing from 1100 miles away.  We take this camera everywhere with us.  If we want to have a permanent print of a special photo we send them to either www.Photoloft.com or www.shutterfly.com and get surprisingly good quality prints.  They charge $.49 per print, which isn�t too bad considering you only process the ones you want to keep.

We did have one problem with the camera where the LCD stopped working.  We called Agfa and they sent us a replacement overnight mail with no questions asked.   The new camera has been working flawlessly for 4 months now. 

The only negatives are the lack of any kind of zoom and the limited resolution.  Then again if you are using the camera for WEB pages, you will never want to shoot anything larger than 640 x 480.   

If you want to give digital photography a try but don�t want to spend a lot of dough then this is the camera for you.  There are many more sophisticated cameras on the market but they will cost at least double what we paid for the Agfa.
