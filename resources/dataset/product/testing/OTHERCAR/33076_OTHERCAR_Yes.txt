            This is a truck for someone who doesn't want to feel like they're driving a truck.  It gives you the feel of a truck (you're up fairly high, you can take potholes, curbs, and bumpy roads pretty easily), but overall it drives more like a car.  The ride is extremely comfortable, and I would definitely recommend the extended cab, and the high backed bucket seats are extremely comfortable. Pick-up and braking are very good, but power is not that of a full-size. If you want that kind of power, you don't want this truck.  The front has plenty of leg room, and the extended cab is comfortable for kids, but you can only get one other person back there.  And if they're over 5'10&quot;, you probably won't even get that.<br><br>
