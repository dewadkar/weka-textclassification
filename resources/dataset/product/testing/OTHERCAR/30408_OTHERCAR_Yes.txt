            With the addition of twins 3 years ago, our family quickly grew out of our mini-van. When I was hit on the head by a stroller falling out of the hatchback, it was time to look for a vehicle that would accommodate all four of our children plus a double stroller, sports equipment and whatever else we brought along. When my husband came home with a Suburban for me to try out, I thought, &quot;No way can I drive something that large!&quot; Surprisingly, I found it to be very easy to maneuver.  It's no trouble to park, turns sharply, and I have only hit the mailbox once!  As far as interior room, with seating for 8, we have plenty of room to separate our twins' car seats (no more biting or slapping) take along a friend or two, and still fit in that stroller...even pile the groceries in and have room left over.  I highly recommend the Suburban for larger families.  It's not that bad on gas, either...I fill up about every 2-3 weeks.  I would suggest getting a model with the rear air-conditioning, makes it much more comfortable in the back.<br><br>
