            I bought the van in April 1999. At the time I despised vans. My wife wanted one , so we went out and started comparing various prices and models from the different manufacturers. At that time I found the Honda model to be the best driving van. I bought her the Plymouth because the dealer was willing to discount the van to a price that was a lot more palletable than the Honda. The Honda had a MSRP of $33000 CDN+tax and he would not budge a nickel. The Plymouth MSRP was $29000 CDN and I paid 25,500 CDN.
I really was worried about my purchase. I read horror stories about Chrysler quality and reliability prblems.

Over the last 3 years I have come to realy like this van. I have spent a lot of hot sunny days sitting behind the van with the hatch open, acting as a sunbrella, watching my son play baseball. The hatch has also been an umbrella at several of my daughters soccer matches.I knew it was a good people hauler but I did not realize at the time of purchase that it would transport people in such a smooth and comfortable fashion. The van now has 80,000 KMS. thats 50,000 miles for you Americans.The only money spent on it besides routine maintenance was $18.00 on one new wiper blade. Knock on wood,I hope the repair trend stays on plane.

The air conditioning system is powerful and cools the cabin easily. The engine warms up fast in the winter and the windows defrost quickly. The cabin has not developed any sqeaks or rattles as yet.The front window electric defrost is a great feature when snowing.

The van does not handle like a BMW but it handles better than a lot of family cars. Over all I find the van a great value compared to a regular sedan. 

Things that can be improved are miles per gallon. The fuel consumption is not worse than other vans but I would like better mileage. This van with a small good quality diesel engine would have competitors on the run.

I would like to trade it in for a 2002 model but the color choice of the new model with interior choices stink. The price has also increased by a substantial amount. The only justification for the higher price is a better warranty. basically the van is the same as the 99 model mechanically.

The resale of these vans don't seem to be very good. I will try and keep this one for as long as possible. I wonder how much mileage I will have on it in the year 2025?
