            I bought my 1991 Mazda Protege sometime around 1995 (hard to be specific - I honestly can't remember) and since then it has been more reliable than most used cars I've seen.  I took it to school (college) with me, and made the 540 mile trip back home(round-trip) over 20 times.  It thus gives me great pleasure to proclaim that I am quite happy with its performance in such conditions.

Over the years, there have been problems - the clutch needed replacing, as did the muffler, and I've gone through 2 batteries - but nothing drastic, like an engine overhaul or new transmission.  The Protege has surprising power for a 4 cylinder engine, with excellent pickup (I can beat most automatics off the line, hands down) and a surprising top speed (of well over 90).  It handles well, the seats are comfortable, and the gas mileage (28 mpg in the city, 25-40 mpg on highway) is superb.  

The downsides?  Well, there have been repairs (see above).  I just recently blew my alternator belt while driving on the interstate, and that was a pain since truck stop mechanics aren't all that well versed in Japanese automotive repair.  The engine and truck hoods are discoloring, too - oxidation or something, I suppose, but the end result is an ugly paint job when viewed in direct sunlight.  The clutch problem I mentioned above was the most expensive repair - it ran about $600 at the time, but everything else has been minimal.  

Overall, if you're looking at a used car, a Mazda Protege is a fairly reliable and worthwhile car to check out.  Later models (after 1991) will probably have better repair records, but I'm still driving my '91 and it still suits me fine.   
<b>3</b> stars, 1 off for repairs and 1 off for the cosmetic problems.<br><br>
