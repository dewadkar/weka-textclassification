            When I totaled my car and was car shopping. I wasn't expecting to get a new car. I was 18 on my own for the first time and had just started a new career. But since I was living with my friend and her parents (a long long story lol) I trusted them to go with me shopping. We stopped off at the Saturn lot to look at the used cars when I saw it.

The 1994 SL1 caught my eye. It was cool, compact and still had lots of room. I wasn't even going to try for it when my friends parent told me to test drive it. That was it. My friend and I went around the block and that was love at first sight. Next problem was that I was young. But I got the cosigners and the next day I had my baby. 

Some may think that it was unwise of me to buy a new car. But I was making good money, and I kept great care of that car. I got the maintenance when I was supposed to and everything. But 1 year after I bought it my love started to turn sour.

I don't know everything that went wrong with it cause I don't follow auto mechanics very well. I do know that the transmission was going and so were the brakes. It leaked oil and gas, also. It had a lot of other problems also which ended up they were going to cost more than it was worth. So in the end my first new car went bye bye.

I would not recommend this car to anyone, unless you are a mechanic and can fix the problems yourself. That way you would know what was wrong better than I could.
