            I owned one of the first 1984 Nissan 300z 2+2 bought in fall of 1983.  I held onto it for four years, living my dream.  Then I discovered snow and mountains.  I was living in Florida were life is day to day the same.  In 1986 I started traveling with my then young kids.  The 300z even with the two extra "seats" was not big enough.  I observed people driving around in SUV's and checked into if Nissan, a name I trust, made one.  They had just made the 1987 Pathfinder but waited till the 1988 to purchase one.  I test drove it and wondered how I would go from a sport car with top speed of 145 mph to an SUV.  After the test drive I wondered no longer.  My Pathfinder was white exterior with blue interior.  I named her Blue Angel, the ultimate party mobile.  I took her everywhere.  I moved to South Carolina two months later.  I drove many times on return trips to Florida and the trip was very comfortable for everyone. Even drove to Colorado and explored the Rockies. Exception was the Pathfinder was only two door.
The next year they made a four door, wonder if they took my suggestion?  I held onto my 1988 for ten years.  I bought another one in 1996, this one had all the toys.  Sun roof, CD-Player, six speakers, four doors, outside mounted spare tire, more ground clearance, stronger engine. It was black exterior with tan interior.  I named him Black Knight.  He has been my best car yet.  He took me all over the USA, from South Carolina to California up to Washington State, over to Illinois and back to South Carolina. Great gas mileage, lots of room for your stuff and people too.  I highly recommend the Pathfinder no matter what year.  For the money invested, it is a great vehicle.  I get routine oil changes, and use good grades of gasoline.  I only use Amoco gasoline.  In all the years with my Pathfinders, they have been dependable and highly reliable.  My most favorite thing to do other than traveling in my Pathfinder is going through the snow in 4WD.  My Australian husband in taking his driving test for America, had to parallel park the Pathfinder downtown.  He did it on his first attempt.  I think that speaks volumes on the ease of driving the Pathfinder. I want to get my 1996 paid off for awhile before I purchase another one.  I have over 120,000 miles on this one and had over 170,000 miles on the 1988 one which I sold in 1998 for $5,000.  Wish I still had it.  Nissan is the only car that I recommend.  You get your monies worth and they are low maintenance vehicles.  My dream car is a Hummer.....but only a dream.
