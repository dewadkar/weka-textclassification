            My,friend ED bought this car because it looked sporty,was at a good price
and his friend had just traded it in. He say his gas mileage is about 28
miles to the gallon. It has really good power and drives like a dream on
and off of the expressway. He took me to see some friends and check out
a road. The cars traction left me open mouthed. It went so well in the snow that I thought it was a four wheel drive.
   Now for the down side, he has had to put 3 clutches in this car,The dealership paid for the first two. Ed told me that he believes he felt
the clutch slip again.Which means more money but this guy still likes the car. He is more forgiving than I am. The dealers tell him that they
think their just getting the wrong clutch. While I may be a man of few words,you got the idea,right. <br><br>
