            I write this review after seven (7) years of ownership!

I bought my 93 Honda del Sol Si used at 30K miles for 11.5K-ish and got a helluva deal.

This summer, at 145,000 miles, I was bragging to friends, family, co-workers, basically anyone that would listen, about how trouble-free the car has been. Nothing major, just a few minor maintenance expenses like tires, brakes, belts, the usual. It starts in the deep freeze of winter and the engine doesn't leak a drop of anything.

Well, wouldn't you know, I jinxed myself because suddenly my transmission went south. Okay, I have to admit, I deserved it, I only had the transmission serviced once about three years and 50,000 miles ago. Not to mention that I drive it a little hard. Considering it lasted that long is probably a miracle.

Anyway, I faced a repair bill equal to the value of the car, but I did the repair anyway because I couldn't bear to part with my baby. I consider cars to be a necessary evil so my having a sentimental attachment to one says a lot. How I lament Honda's discontinuation of this Bad Boy!

Anyway, I join the ranks of goofy del Sol owners that just cannot let go!

p.s. I don't consider it's small size a "con" - it's a "pro" for me!

Other feedback:

Engine Size: 1.6 on the Si, not huge, but for it's size it has done very well; however, with age has come a little loss of power, to be expected. The same goes for gas mileage; in the earlier years of ownership I would get 32-33 mpg; these days I hover in the high 20s.

It's better suited for smaller people than bigger people; it rides low, so taller drivers/riders might find it confining; being a shorty, I never had a problem. 

The handling is great! Hugs the road on turns amazingly. Unless it's wet/icy/snowy; more care needs to be taken in rough weather, which is true for any car I guess.

The braking is not overly touchy, but serviced at regular intervals makes a difference. 

The trunk is surprisingly roomy, but it needs to be to fit the target top. Still, this is a small car so don't expect to haul huge loads. That's what pickups are for!
