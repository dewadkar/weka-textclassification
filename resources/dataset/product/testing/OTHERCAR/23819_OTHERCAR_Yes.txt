            I recently purchased a new 2001 Toyota Echo. The current price of gasoline dictated that mileage would be a top priority. The Echo's suggested gas mileage of 40 mpg city/ 51 highway is certainly an attractive feature of this car. When you sit in this car the first thing that will amaze you is the amount of interior head and legroom. The seats are comfortable and the back can seat three adults with relative ease. There are plenty of storage areas and the standard stereo sounds very good. 
The engine is quiet and quite powerful. The standard 5-speed transmission  shifts smoothly and makes driving  enjoyable. The car comes with a very good heater, excellent visibility, and both passenger and driver side air bags. 
The Echo looks different, nice looking to some and down right ugly to others. At first glance I thought it looked like a longer car that was put into a vice. Over time I must admit the look actually grows on you. 
The Echo drives very smoothly over city streets and is generally quiet on the highway. The only down side with highway driving is a strong gust of wind can cause the car to wander a bit. No doubt this is because of the high roof line and the light weight. The power of the engine will have you speeding without realizing you are in the ticket danger zone.
 Why is the speedometer in the middle of the dash? The reality is that you become used to the different location easily and over time come to prefer the location. The only con is that when I turn on the signal flasher to turn left for some reason I think I turned on the wrong one because the flasher is flashing to my right, making me think I turned on the right hand flasher.
The Echo could use a few more gauges; it does not have  heat or oil pressure gauges, nor does it have a tachometer. It does however have a good number of warning chimes. They include a warning for seatbelts (both driver and passenger) lights on, low on fuel, door ajar, gas cap not secured properly and low windshield washer fluid along with the standard engine lights.
There is plenty of trunk space and the rear seats fold down individually allowing you to put in longer items such as golf bags.(The one thing I enjoy putting in the trunk!)
The Echo may not be the be the &quot;coolest&quot; looking car on the road. However, given today's gas and insurance prices, it may be one of the smartest looking investments on the road. Buy this car if you want great gas mileage, reliability , and peace of mind at an affordable price.<br><br>
