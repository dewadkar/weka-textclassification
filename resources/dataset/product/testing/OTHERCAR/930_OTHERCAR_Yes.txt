            I now have 14,000 miles on my black XG 350L and Im still convinced I got the best car in its class.  Honda, Toyota, Nissan or any domestic car doesnt come close for value and quality.  
	
The only things I can think to complain about are the front cup holders, turning radius and the windshield wiper blades.  The cup holders are too close together and are of different size, two drinks from the drive through of medium size will tilt the cups towards the seats and if there is a loose lid, watch out.  You will also be doing a lot of 3 point turns in smaller intersections and not so wide roads due to the very large turning radius of the car.  The wiper blades should be changed as soon as you drive off the lot. 

But that is it for the bad.  The rest of the care is an example of what a quality car should be.  The interior quality is second to none.  From the door panels to the roof lining, its all quality.  I havent had any rattling or unusual cabin noise.  The engine runs smoothly and is only noticeable when putting a load on the gas pedal.  

The car is definitely a cruiser; the ride is smooth and comfortable.  The back seat is even more comfortable than the drivers seat with plenty of room for 3 full sized adults.

The cabin is spacious and well appointed with an attractive wood trim.  All of the controls are easy to use and reach.  Its also nice to have the option of manual or automatic shifting with the tectronic shifter.  The list of standard features is almost endless when compared to the other vehicles in its class.  The coolest feature that I thought wasnt that big a deal are the tilting side view mirrors, they are very handy when parallel parking or just backing up to the curb.

If you are looking for a car in this class, do yourself a favor and add the XG 350L to your list of must test drives.  You will be glad you did.  You will also be glad when you write your check every month for a lot less than you expected for a car of its quality.
