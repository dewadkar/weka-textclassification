            All I can say is GET YOU ONE! Sure, the car does'nt ride like a Cadillac, but the looks well make up for it. I have owned this car for quite a while now and have loved every minute of it. 

WHY I WANTED IT? 
Just the looks you get driving down the road is worth buying one alone! Heck, in my town, you would think it was a $300,000.000 Ferrari. The car is very attractive with Guards Red paint. It is equipped with Savannah Beige leather interior and aluminum accents. Of course its a manual, a Porsche is not a Porsche unless you have the stick! My car has the Sports Package which includes 18" Turbo style sport rims, tighter suspension, and overall greater performance (about a $3,000.00 option). It also has the Litronic headlamp system (xenons) that really make it stand out at night and dramatically increases visibility. Since I have owned the car, I have added Speedster-humps behind the roll-bars ($2,500) and stainless steel door sills with painted crest ($500.00). Also, I have added a titanium "PORSCHE" decal ($30.00) on the rear spoiler that rises at 75mph...I love watching people&#146s faces in my mirror when "Porsche" flashes its name in front of them! I have to admit...sometimes I can&#146t stand it...I have to manually raise it with the one-touch push button at red-lights (I can't help it). 

In my opinion the car was truly meant to be a weekend driver only. The car is quite comfortable (for a smaller person) and handles OUTSTANDING. I have to say though that after a couple of hours of driving, my back does have a slight pain...but that does'nt bother me one bit (what sports car doesn't hurt your back after non-stop driving?).  Just take a break, walk around, and get back into the car for more driving thrill!  In the Boxster, you might as well have a spotlight on you...every person around is looking at you! 

The car comes standard with a CD player...a must now a days. My car has the Factory upgraded Bose surround sound with a factory amp...this really helps the stereo out. However, the car is quite loud and minimizes stereo sound quality. I have been told NUMEROUS times that the car sounds like a jet engine inside when you&#146re starting off and slowing down (being the motor placed right behind the seats). The Porsche "roar" is quite loud, but once again...that&#146s what makes people think it&#146s a "Race-car".

The Porsche Boxster is powerful.  With the car being small in size and light, it starts very quickly and shifts extremely smoothly.  I'm not saying that you would blow a F-50 away at a red light, but you will most likely embarrass the average Vette, Mustang, BMW, or Firebird if you know how to shift correctly.  The cars brakes works wonderfully for a high performance sports car.  They have no noise and can stop on a dime.  The Boxster comes with two trunks, one in front and one in the back.  You can actually fit a full set of golf clubs in the rear trunk and groceries in the front (But hey...don't take a baby like this to a grocery store, those buggies are dangerous!).

The Boxster instrument panel design in quite simple, all you need and nothing you don't for a sports car of this caliber.  If you notice, its much like the other exotics such as Ferrari, Lambo, or Lotus.  The car has two gauges for speed, one dial and one digital.  Most everything on the car can be worked by the touch of a button.  The convertible top operates wonderfully by just the touch of a button (Now I can say one thing, lowering the top in a crowd is fun!).  With the top down, the car is impressively quite for a convertible...and likewise when its up.  At speeds of 80 mph, there is no buffeting within the car or any other annoying noise.  With the low windshield, the car resembles the traditional speedster and its aerodynamics makes it cut through the wind easily.  

GET READY FOR EXPENSIVE SERVICE!!! 
My car has a little over 14,000 miles on it and I have just had the "Inspection 1" service completed. Porsche recommends service every 15k miles, or once a year. The "Inspection 1" cost me right at $500.00 which covered everything (they really do a lot when they service it). So, to keep your warranty good and your car in top shape, I really recommend taking it to Porsche for a service even though it is quite expensive. 

SHOULD TEENS BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE IT? 
YOUR CALL! The Boxster is very fast and could be driven like a race car if the wrong person got behind the wheel. While I had my "Inspection 1" service completed, Porsche gave me their loaner car...another Boxster. While at home, I was asked by a 19 year old if he could drive the car. My first impulse was "YEA RIGHT", but then thought "Well, this is'nt *my* car, so why not?". So...I let him drive it. I was smart enough to go along for the ride. I knew something was up when I heard the engine roar up before pulling out of the driveway. When the coast was clear...all I heard was tire squeal. He was hanging curves at 80 mph on a back road and driving like we were on the Autobaun! He handled the car quite well, but WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN MY CAR. I have to say that I was quite impressed with the car, it was almost as if the car was glued to the road. 

PROBLEMS? ADVICE... 
I have had absolutely...NO... problems with the car whatsoever, that&#146s why I will continue the $500.00 Service inspections. The car is just wonderful. I owned a BMW Convertible before the Boxster, its Service was over $700.00 and I had multiple problems with it. The Porsche blows the BMW away in driving pleasure and quality (In my opinion). In addition, Porsche service is outstanding.  They treat you extremely well and are always on time (I guess thats what you deserve when you give $50,000  for one of their cars).  On the Boxster, the hood does slop down quite low and the front has no grill area (so there is ALOT of paint there waiting to be chipped by rocks and bugs). To help this...all I say is WAX WAX WAX! I can honestly say that my Boxster does'nt have one rock/bug chip! A great wax can be found at www.zainobros.com.  My only hassle with the car is the plastic rear window. You really have to wax it to keep it looking good.

CONCLUSION:
I have owned numerous cars in the past, and I have to say that the Boxster is my favorite one so far.  I will DEFINATELY be going back to Porsche later on should I decide to buy another car.  The cars sleek appearance is really an eye catcher whether your at red-light downtown or speeding past others on the highway.  If you are intending on buying a convertible any time soon, give BOXSTER the first opportunity to change your driving experience...now and forever.
