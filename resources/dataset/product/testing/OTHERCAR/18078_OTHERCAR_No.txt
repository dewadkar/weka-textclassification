            I got a brand new Dodge Neon when I was 17 years old.  I had a full time job, and my parents decided that I was responsible enough to take on the car payments as long as I could keep up my grades.  So, we went car shopping.  I test drove a new brilliant blue neon with only 32 miles on it.  Of course I wanted it.  It was BRAND NEW...needless to say I was young and dumb.  I could afford the car, but the bad thing about it was that after I had it for about 8 months, everything started to malfunction.  Most people would call it a &quot;lemon.&quot;  I traded the car because it became dangerous.  I don't just have bad things to say about the neon.  It is a cute car that got great gas mileage.  I hated to get rid of it, but I just got a bad one!  It was very comfortable, and it had a great stereo system in it.  I thought that I was lucky to be able to get a new car at such a young age, but I am just saying be sure to get extended warranties because you never know what kind of car you may be getting.<br><br>
