            I noticed I needed a camera when my old 35mm simply stopped, no reason why, it just stopped. My wife told me she would buy any camera I wanted, so I went shopping.
Holy Cow!!! There are a lot of digital cameras out there! 
But when I saw the Mavica I simply knew it would be the one I would get. Why? A couple reasons sold me. 
First, it seemed to be a lot easier to use than a lot of cameras I looked at. Just find what you want to shoot, point, click the button. Done. Then I noticed that it did have some options, different flash options, picture effects, a nice display and more. 
The second reason is that it uses 3.5" floppy disks as storage medium. To me this makes things much simpler, no downloading pictures to the hard drive, no separate hardware to take care of, simply slap the disk in and work with the pictures. Nice.
If you want the smaller, bigger storage mediums, there is an adapter to use memory cards. They sell a floppy adapter that you put the memory card into and bang! you have megabytes of room. Nice.
The only thing that I balked at was the price. It was $478 for the camera and a strap etc. I decided that it was worth it for what I was going to get, I don't regret it.
The photo quality was bad at first, but I am learning that a lot of that depends on how you use the camera, it just takes time to learn what zoom, lighting and the rest that you should use for the best picture quality. I have shown the pictures I take to friends, and they are impressed with the quality, I am too. As a matter of fact, once a friend saw the pictures and the camera, he decided to buy one, and also doesn't regret it.
I definitely recommend this camera to the average camera user.
