            Things I like about this car:
- Great looking, really sporty looks.
- Smooth and quiet engine.  The V6 has lot's of power.
- Honda's reliability.
- Very nice interior, with leather seat, moonroof, homelink, wood trim. The interior of the Accord looks much better than the Camry.
- The backseats are actually pretty roomy, for a coupe.
- Cornering and handling are pretty decent, thanks to the Double Wishbone suspension.
- Great value for this kind of quality.

Things I don't like about this car:
- The automatic transmission is not smooth, when your press the gas pedal hard.  The shift is too rough, especially compares to a Camry.
- Also thanks to the double wishbone suspension, road noise and vibration is more obvious than in a Camry.

Overall, this is an awesome car for its price.  However, if you are buying a fully loaded EX V6, you should consider shelling up extra $5000 to get an Acura 3.2 TL, because with TL, you got:
- a bigger engine, with 25 more horsepower than the Accord V6.
- sequential sport shift 5 speed transmission, which is cool looking, though not terribly practical.
- the Acura name, and you will find a lot less TL on the road than the Accord.
- one more year of warranty (or 12000 more miles).
- automatic climate control system<br><br>
