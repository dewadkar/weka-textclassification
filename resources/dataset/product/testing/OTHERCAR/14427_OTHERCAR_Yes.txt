            I purchased a '97 in '98 with 7,500 miles. It's V-6, 2WD, auto,A/C. I now have 27K on it.

The positives are similar to other comments I've seen here. It's car-like in handling and creature comforts, including ride. It seems a very tight truck. The V-6 has good power and torque, and the automatic is uncannily like a manual in choosing the correct gear, seamlessly. 

On the negative side, I've had significant reliability problems in my 27K. First, the battery died, then a fuel pump quit and left me stranded. Later, the rack and pinion were replaced, and recently some gunk in the fuel line stranded my wife. All repairs were under warranty, so they were time consuming but painless.

Quite frankly, in my case, it has been a troublesome vehicle, some what ameliorated by its excellent design. I don't use this car in a trade and treat it gently with most driving done on Xways, or on well maintained rural roads.<br><br>
