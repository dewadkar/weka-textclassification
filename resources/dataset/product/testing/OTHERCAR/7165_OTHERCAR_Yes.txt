            I was on a tight budget but needed a vehicle bigger than a car. I was down-sizing from a high top conversion van for gas mileage reasons. What I have found about this 1999 Dodge Caravan is that there is more seating room than a car but if you need more than that it just isn't quite big enough in this model.
 There is barely enough room in the back for folded lawn chairs or sports equipment. Anyone sitting on the back seat just about has to be a child or have knees pressed against the middle seat. The rear seat folds forward sandwich style only so it isn't much help in hauling anything substantial. One good thing though, is that the middle and rear seats DO come out and you are able to use the van somewhat like a truck that way. 
Since I coach and have to haul equipment a lot, I often have to take the middle seat out, move the back seat forward and simply get used to only being able to hold 5 total passengers during sports season.
  The model does drive well. It handles like a small compact car and is easily steered in and out of tight places. My model does not have cruise control so I have to be careful about speeding in it since it often &quot;flies&quot;. I am very disappointed though in my gas mileage. I had hoped for at least 20mpg but am only getting about 15mpg
