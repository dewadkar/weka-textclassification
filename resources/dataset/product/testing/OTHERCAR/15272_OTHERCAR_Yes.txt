            The moment I bought this camera, I knew I was buying something that was well made.  The Sony Mavica MD-81 came with the following in its retail box:

- Camera unit
- Lens cap
- Carrying strap
- Starter battery
- Battery charger and cord
- 3.5&quot; Floppy disk
- Users' manual
- CD with various software
- One-year membership for online photo album
- One-year manufacturer's warranty

Not only is their product sound, but their customer service was very sincere.  This camera was ready to use right out of the box.  With the resolution capability of 1024 X 768, you can produce quality pictures.  The other great feature of this camera is that it is capable of capturing MPEG motion picture.  In standard mode, you can capture 60 full seconds of MPEG video.  In fine mode, you can capture up to 15 seconds.  Since the price of 3.5&quot; floppies are beyond affordable, the Mavica is a great buy.  

A downfall of this camera is that it's very bulky.  It is not something that you put in your shirt pocket... unless it's a huge pocket!  Since the Mavica houses a full 2X 3.5&quot; floppy drive, it's pretty hard for Sony to create a compact Mavica camera.  The other missing feature of the Mavica MD-81 is that it does not offer a video/audio output.  Many digital cameras on the market today offer some type of video/audio output so that you can hook it up to your VCR or TV.  This model does not.  The rechargeable battery that comes with this unit is very weak.  I managed to drain the fully-charged battery in less than 30 minutes.  If you plan on buying this camera, make sure you buy an extra battery (about $50).
