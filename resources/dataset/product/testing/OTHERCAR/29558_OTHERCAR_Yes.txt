            I bought my Stealth one year ago from an individual I met over the internet.  He had several Stealth's for sale, but he had just received a Mystic Blue R/T in from Florida with all the options.  It was a one owner car with 59k original miles.  Well I had him send me more pictures of the car and I absolutely fell in love with it!  This car is an absolute blast to drive.  I'm a 45 year old male, and this car is exciting too drive.  I've had Cuda's, Challengers, GTO's, etc, and enjoyed each and every one of them.  This is the first "Japanese Muscle Car" I've ever owned.  I was a little squeamish with only 220 hp under the hood, but I'm not squeamish anymore.  This rocket get's up and moves out!  I have noticed that the lower RPM band isn't as quick as the higher band, but it doesn't take long to get into that "low flying missle" status!  This car ROCKS!  I just did a spark plug change on her, and it's quite a job to do for the first time.  It's not an easy car to work on.  I'm not exactly a mechanical genius, so it took me longer than most.  All in all, I'd buy another Stealth in a heart beat!  Speaking of heart beats, buy one and it'll get your driving heart beating again also!  Pontiac is driving excitement...I THINK NOT!  Mopar Rules!
