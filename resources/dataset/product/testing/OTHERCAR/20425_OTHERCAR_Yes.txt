            I am so pleased with my with my 5 speed, four door,black, camel color interior, GL Jetta.  I love getting into everyday for work and feeling the power of the car.  It has really comfortable front seating, plush interior, and a heavy pulling feel as you drive.  When you close the doors or trunk you know it is secure because they feel and are very solid.  They're not light to the touch like most compact cars are when shut closed.  I have to say I enjoy the heaviness the most with the Jetta.

  I also love the interior lights at night.   Instead of the neon greeny lights most cars possess, the Jetta has a pleasing pinky and purple combination which is much kinder to the eye.  And even know it's shallow to boast, they look cool too!  The Jetta gets awesome mileage.  My car gets about 42 miles per gallon.  And that's a huge plus  living in LA when the gas prices are being so insane right now.  I basically live in my car because LA requires a lot of driving and taxing traffic jams.  I never get uncomfortable in it, I just relax. The speaker system is wonderful too.  My Jetta came with 8 speakers which delivers fantastic sound quality.  You can adjust the sound system to your liking very easily and can store up to 12 radio channels. 

 Most people enjoy the smooth ride and the power the Jetta has.  When you shift from first gear to second you surely experience the force of the car.  The car comes with power locks that are controlled with your key.  It also makes a light beep sound to let you know that you have locked your door.  It's great when you have lot's of stuff to pile in your car and your hands are not  always free.  Yeah, it's fast.  I mean really fast.  I can go up steep hills without losing any power even if my A/C is on. VW also gave me an excellent warranty on my car.  So far I have had no technical problems to report on.  I have owned the car for almost a year without any difficulties.

The only drawbacks I have encountered is the small seating area in the back for adult passengers.  I sat in the rear myself and felt a little cramped in my legs.  Another strange thing my car does is leak a thick oil on the drivers side of the car.  It sticks to the outside of my car door and is very hard to clean off.  When I asked VW why it did that they said on hot days the lubricant leaks out but is completely normal for the car to experience that.  I find it annoying and a bit of an eye sore at times.  I have to use a credit card to scrape it off.
