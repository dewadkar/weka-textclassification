            After the birth of our son Brandon and the purchase of our new home My wife and I both realized we were going to need a larger vehicle then the current mid-sized sedans we had owned. 

We decided that if we were going to buy a minivan we were going to do it right the first time. We intended to spend a little more to get a van with proven quality i.e. the Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. What we didn't expect to find was such value for what we paid.

The fact that Honda was not discounting their Odyssey's &amp; we had a 5 month wait made the choice even simpler. We were able to buy our 2000 Sienna LE at a great price &amp; had it made at the factory and delivered in under 4 weeks!

The Sienna has a V6 Camry engine and it rides both smooth and quiet. The acceleration is outstanding and the handling is better than the Saturn SL1 I traded in. We added both the extra value package and the LE Upgrade package which gave us power rear quarter windows(a must!), captain's chairs in the 2nd row(instead of the bench) and most importantly a remote power sliding door on the passenger side(we use it constantly!) 

One of the best features of the Sienna is its flexibility; The 3rd row consist of a 50/50 split which makes it easy for even my wife to remove the chairs. I recently took out the right side 2nd &amp; 3rd row chairs to take in my lawnmower for servicing. It was both quick and easy to not only take them out but to also put them back in. You can also tumble up the 3rd row seats to expand the cargo area without having to remove them.

Another great feature is that you can control the AM/FM 6 speaker/cassette/CD player with controls on the steering wheel.I can switch modes, change stations and volume and even mute all without taking my eyes off the road. 

The Sienna comes standard with ABS and the LE offers power heated outside mirrors which will definately come in handy this winter. It also has a built in compartment where you can place and activate your garage door opener. It even comes with a full-size (that's right!) spare tire.

Last month we took a long road trip to Boston(over 7 hour trip) and it was one of the most comfortable rides I have had in a long time. I liked the experience so much I am taking the family down to Sesame Place in Pennsylvania this month. This is not a trip I would have planned if I didn't have the Sienna! 

For the price we paid we have received all the quality and performance that Toyota is known for. The flexibility and features are perfectly blended together making this a great van to go on a long trip or to the market on the corner! I recommend this car to anyone who either owns a home, has a family or both!
