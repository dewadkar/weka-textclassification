            <b>Sony Mavica takes CD-R technology on the road</b>

I've been a Nikon disciple for over 10 years, but the new CD-capable Sony Mavica lured me away from the digital Coolpix series. While planning a trip to Europe, I decided my venerable Nikon CP-900 just wasn't up to the vacation photo task anymore. I wanted more control than the 900 could offer-- precise aperture and shutter priorities, manual focusing, finer EV compensation, and external flash options.

The two latest Nikon offerings, the CP-990 and the professional D1 both fit the bill. We'd all be using the D1 if we could afford it... but after consulting the checkbook, my considerations came down to either updating my Nikon or braving the waters on a first generation product with the new Sony Mavica CD-1000. The destination for my digital work is primarily the web, so the difference between a 2 or 3 megapixel camera is negligible. If my final product is a print, there is still no substitute for film.


<b>Much better image quality than previous Mavicas</b>

In the past, I've been a snob for the &quot;Nikkor glass&quot; and that influenced my decision in the digital format as well. With the previous generations of Mavicas, the floppy file-size limitation put the image quality far below my standards, nevermind the quality of the glass. With a firm step forward, Sony has broken through that barrier by exchanging the floppies for CDs, increasing the capacity a hundredfold. Now that the new Mavica isn't crippled by disk size, the real quality of the photos can be seen without the overbearing JPG compression. While based on the same body and electronics, the CD-1000's normal file size is three times larger than it's sister Mavica FD-95... that means less lossy compression and cleaner originals. There's even the option to write totally uncompressed TIFFs, and this is the one camera that has the storage capacity to do it.

The new CD-1000 covered most of my wishlist, giving me much more manual control than the previous 900 I was used to. I'm still waiting for the day when I can match my favorite glass to a digital CCD, but until then, this new Sony will fit the bill. The new Mavica offers one important advantage over the Nikon as a vacation camera-- while traveling abroad, the CD-R capable Mavica has unchained me from the laptop. Instead of the hourly chore of moving all the images to a hard drive to clear up room, I can now simply swap in a new disc. ($6 for a pack of 5, each one holds 170 full resolution images.)


<b>Still camera in camcorder clothing</b>

The most unsuspecting feature I've found is the brilliant image stabilization technology. While using the long 10x telephoto or the macro mode, this jitter-reducing feature really gives you a tack sharp photo even with less-than-steady hands. You can now forget the tripod for quick macro shots! This still camera acts more like a modified video unit than a traditional SLR, and borrows heavily from Sony's camcorder expertise. It has a comfortable SLR feel with an ergonomic grip; in one way I admire the larger, more traditional pro-sumer look-- but I also miss the stealth possible from the small rotating Coolpix body. Add on the external flash, bracket, and a Lumiquest, and this Mavica will let you mix slyly in with any pro photographers. My standard film gear includes Nikon F3s and old heavy lenses, so the bulkiness and weight isn't a detraction to me, but be warned that this is one of the largest digicams you're likely to lift.

The lens paired with the CD-1000 is a 10x monster that gives you the 35mm equivalent of 39-390mm. For my shooting style, I'd much rather have something on the wider end and less telephoto. Necessary accessories include the wide-angle adapter ($50) and external flash unit ($100).
 
Luckily, this camera frees you from the Coolpix necessary accessories of batteries, charger, and a card reader. The Mavica includes Sony's smart Lithium Ion battery technology which recharges inside of the camera and also communicates with the body to let you know exactly how many minutes of life it has left. The battery recharges in 3 to 4 hours, lasts over two hours with LCD, and extras are $50 each. Another unique feature of the Sony is dual LCD screens-- a decent one on the back and another inside the viewfinder. Turning off the larger one saves battery power, and having the smaller one allows you to shoot just like an SLR.


<b>Great piece but too expensive</b>

Of course there are downsides with any first generation product... The durability of a portable CD writing mechanism is often questioned, but this Mavica has performed flawlessly so far, even while trying to make the laser skip when writing. This delay while the CD records brings up the biggest frustration with the new Mavica. The wait from pressing the shutter to the next available frame is still far too long. I understand this is a limit of the technology, but why not use a simple RAM buffer to allow a series of 5 photos before having to write to the disc?  The delay actually isn't as bad as I expected, often between 3 and 4 seconds-- about the same as my old Nikon which was simply writing to a SmartMedia card. 

Despite the long reaching telephoto and image stabilization, this camera is not capable of high-level sports photography. Anything above little league, and the action will be too fast for the camera to handle. (Of course, this can be said about any digital camera currently under $5000.) The manual focusing ring is too small and not precise enough for quick follow-focusing skills. While a digicam with manual focus might interest those wanting more control, trying to focus the small grainy LCD is nothing like using a bright SLR viewfinder.

The Mavica CD-1000 isn't the perfect digicam, but it may be the best yet in combining quality imaging with ease-of-use while still allowing enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of us. It is currently overpriced (you pay a $300 premium for the CD capability over the sister Mavica), but should be in the $1000 range soon enough. Sony put together a great package of features and finally produced a model that will get the attention of serious amateur photographers.
