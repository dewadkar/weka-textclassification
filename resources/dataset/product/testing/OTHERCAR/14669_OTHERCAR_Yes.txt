            I bought this vehicle because I wanted a mini-SUV and the Honda CRV felt like a wind-up toy and the RAV4 felt like it was made of plastic.

I live in SE Michigan and our winters totally suck, not tons of snow, but enough to make your commute and pain in the ass, and this car rocks in adverse conditions.  The AWD handling is totally idiot-proof and when I�m stopped at a stoplight during heavy rain or snow and all the other cars spin their wheels to get going, I�m two-tenths of a mile past them by the time they getting going.

The interior of the Forester S is very nice, however if you don�t get leather seats, the fabric seats have got to be the ugliest thing in a car I have ever seen.  I highly recommend the seat warmers and the upgraded stereo, as the standard factory one was a poor performer.

Handling regardless of the AWD is excellent, much better than the Jeep counterpart or the CRV/RAV4 clone.

The pickup from the four-banger is adequate but would really benefit from a V6.

Noise is much better than a Jeep Cherokee or a Chevy Blazer, but the boxy design means that the wind smacks right into the windshield and that can get loud at 50 mph.

The ride comfortable, the seats are a little light on the padding, but again much better than a Jeep, CRV/RAV4.

The storage is great and the back seats fold down with one hand!!! to give you extra room and the hatch lifts up with I find is easier in a garage than a left or right swinging hatch.

On the down side the front passengers have only one cup holder (tough for those five hour trips to the folks� house) and the luggage rack is kinda of hard to adjust for the bike/ski racks, but all in all a very decent mini-SUV.

If you have the extra 3-5 grand above a CRV to spend, I think it is definitely worth it to buy the Subaru Forester.
