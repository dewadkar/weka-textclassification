            I bought my second Grand Am in 1995. Why is a question I often ask myself. The first Grand Am I bought was a 1991 with a quad 4 engine, it was used. After only 6 months I started having problems with it. I traded it in and bought a 1995 Grand Am with the quad 4 engine (this was in October of 1995). This car had 3,000 miles on it, so it was lightly used. 
I have had so many problems with this vehicle. At 38,000 the timing chain broke, when it snapped it hit the valves...which damaged them. My engine flooded which caused all the spark plugs to go bad, and all the filters. This resulted in a $2500 repair bill.
At 55,000 I started having some kind of electrical problem that nobody could pinpoint because it was inconsistent. The dealership and various mechanics kept putting it on a diagnostic machine, to no avail. $1000 later and through process of elimination it all boiled down to one of the wires that connects to the engine itself...it was shorting causing my engine to seize.
Now I am looking at a $400 repair bill to replace the master seal, my mechanic cannot believe it. My vehicle only has 65,000 miles on it, he says this is unheard of...a master cylinder should not go this soon, especially on a 4 cylinder engine. Oh well...<br><br>
