            I just recently got a 2001 Toyota 4Runner SR5 4x4 and let me tell you it's a lot better than the '94 Ford Ranger I used to have. Ok, I'll elaborate further on things you don't already know...but the 4Runner is a really nice car and, I think, worth the $31K I paid for it. Read on.

Things that are exceptional about this car should be things that are important to all car drivers:
- Gas mileage isn't too bad
- I've received many compliments on the general looks of the car
- You know that with the Toyota name comes a car that will last a very long time

Things this car is definitely lacking:
- the stereo is horrendous. You would think that with a $31K car you would get a halfway decent stereo...it is not. The sound is pretty bad. I have determined weather it is because the stereo, speakers, or both are just plain crap. I'm going to replace my speakers soon and hope that is the problem.
- Power. This car doesn't have a whole lot. It's a good thing I don't need it, but I do feel a sense of lag in this area.
- The interior of the 4Runner could use a facelift. I would like a nice wraparound interior with control at the tip of my fingers. Instead I have something that's not even as nice as my old truck. That kinda sucks.

Overall, this is a good car. If you are expecting something perfect right off the lot, you aren't going to get it. But it is definitely a great car is you plan to stay with it for a long time and want a smooth ride that turns heads every now and again.
