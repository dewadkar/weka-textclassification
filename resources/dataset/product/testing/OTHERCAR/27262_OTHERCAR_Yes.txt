            Pontiac Firebird is the best car for speed loving muscle car drivers.  
When you upgrade to the Trans AM option package you end up with one of the fastest stock cars for under $35,000.  
Options avaible for the Trans Am Package:
1.  350cc LT1 engine
2.  Dual Exhaust
3.  Ram Air
4.  ABS
5.  Big Spoiler
6.  WS6 Sports suspension
7.  6 speed manual transmission
8.  Leather seats
9.  T-tops or convertable
10. Aluminum wheels
 
 Even though Ford's Mustang out sells both GM's Firebird and Camaro a Trans Am will always win in a race.  Pontiac Trans Am's are more eye-catching than Mustangs and they are better all around cars.  
  Ever since I could drive I have had my eyes on Firebirds.  My first Firebird was a 1988 Formula WS6.  It had a 305cc V8.  The gas mileage wasnt the best but I could race any car on the street.  My favorite feature was the t-tops.  They were great in the summer.  There wasnt as much wind as a convertible, which I liked, and it kept the car warmer in the winter better than a convertible could.  I never had any major problems with the car other than regular ware and tare.  It ran perfect all the way untill I sold it with 150,000 miles on it.  Now I am ready to purchase my first brand new car and I am ordering a 2000 Firebird Trans Am with all the extras.
  This car is not for the weak.  There are V6 Firebirds avaible for those who just like to look good and arent worried about breaking the land speed record.
