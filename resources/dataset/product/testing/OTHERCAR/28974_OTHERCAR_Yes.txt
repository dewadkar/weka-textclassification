               Introduced in 2001 the Hyundai Santa Fe has been selling like hot cakes. Good price, good looks, and an excellent warranty has helped the Santa Fe to be Catapulted into superstardom.

       <b>For 2002</b> the Hyundai Santa Fe comes in 5 trim lines; the base model, the GLS 2WD, LX 2WD, GLS 4WD, and the LX 4WD. Powertrains are carryovers from the '01 model year. The engines include a 2.4 liter 4-cylinder that is offered in the base model only, and a DOHC 2.7 liter V6 powers the rest of the trim lines. My test Santa Fe, that I still occasionally use for work dutys, was a GLS 2WD powered by the 2.7 liter DOHC V6 that pumps out an adequate 181 horsepower at 6,000 RPM, and 177 lb-ft of torque. This Engine is mated with a 'shiftronic' 4-speed automatic transmission, as are all the V6 powered Santa Fe's. 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is a little sluggish, but not too bad with the V6, I couldn't imagine driving this vehicle with the 4-cylinder. Even with the V6, at a green light you will find yourself almost flooring the gas pedal to keep the drivers behind you happy. The automatic transmission is really not what the doctor ordered for the Santa Fe. Not only does the transmission have a problem in town with slight hesitation between gears, it also makes hill climbing a little rough when down-shifting from 4th to 3rd gear. 
Hills are not too much of a problem for the Santa Fe, it will inevitably down-shift on steep inclines at high speeds, but recovers speed quite nicely. <b>Cruising</b> is pleasant. Bumps, wind noise, and engine noise are kept to a minimum at almost all speeds(75 MPH there is some slight wind and roadgrain noise). <b>Handling</b> is really not the Santa Fe's strong point. Hyundai claims it handles like a car, but I have yet to drive a car that handles as badly as the Santa Fe, maybe a 1956 Ford Fairlane? Anyway this SUV handles like the bulk of them, so don't expect Honda S2000 cornering. 
<b>Braking</b> on the other hand is quite impressive. 4-wheel disc brakes are standard, and optional 4 wheel ABS made for very sure stops, even at high speeds. I would give you an off-road report, but like most SUVs on the road, this one has never been driven off of concrete or asphalt. All-in-all the Hyundai Santa Fe V6 GLS 2WD is a adequate performer, but more power matched with an optional 5 or 6 speed manual would be appreciated.
<b> NOTE:</b> Expect to get around 27 mpg with the GLS 2WD. Also a 5-speed manual comes standard with the base model matched with the 4 cylinder.   

  The 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe sits on a 103" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 177.2." The Santa Fe's Platform is based on the Hyundai Sonata's which consists of an all independent <b>suspension</b>, which uses Macpherson struts all around and coil springs.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
   
The <b>interior</b> of the Santa Fe GLS is quite surprising, especially for a SUV in this price range. The Santa Fe is loaded with standard equipment, which includes AC, a Leather wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, a theft deterrent system, cup holders; both front and rear, tachometer, and a decent sounding; 6 speaker sound system which offers both a Cassette and CD player. Besides lots of plastic, the cabin of the Santa Fe is quite inviting. The cloth bucket Seats are a little hard, but are semi comfortable and offer good support. These seats unfortunately do not offer power adjustments. The drivers position is excellent, and ergonomics are almost perfect, with very easy-to-read instrumentation. The rear seats are of the 60/40 split variety, and also offer good support. These seats fold down offering loads of cargo space. Room is more than adequate up front, and the rear passengers, unless over 6'5" will not suffer from claustrophobia. The Santa Fe will accommodate 5 adults.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>  

   The <b>exterior</b> of the Hyundai Santa Fe is 'one of a kind.' Ever wonder what a car would look like if it went to the Gym? Ok, that was a stupid question, but the Santa Fe looks like it has been working out for years. Muscle everywhere, a Curvaceous body, with voluptuous accents make the Santa Fe one of the best looking SUV's on the market. The Santa Fe has a sloping hood to help with aerodynamics for a more wind cheating design that also helps gas mileage. The GLS comes standard with 16" alloy rims, and my test GLS has a Roof rack which I think adds some appeal. 

   <b>Price, Reliability, and Warranty</b>  The base price on this vehicle is around $17,000, but can run up to $24,000 with options. Compared to the competition this is quite a deal! Since this is a 2002 model, it's too early to report on reliability, but this vehicle has been driven 6,000 miles and still has not had any problems. If anything does happen to your Santa Fe, Hyundai backs all their vehicles with a 5 year, 60,000 mile bumper to bumper Warranty, and a 10 year, 100,000 mile warranty.  


<b>Conclusion:</b> Even though this SUV does not offer good out-right performance, it offers so many other solid attributes, that this SUV is recommended 100%.
