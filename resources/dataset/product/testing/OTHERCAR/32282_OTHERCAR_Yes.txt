            I just received my Coolpix 995 and WOW!!!!  I began taking photos right away.  The camera is easy to use out of the box.  Charge the Li-ion battery, load it, load your included 16MB Compact Flash Card, turn the lens and you're ready to shoot.  I began taking varius types of photos and I immediately could see the benefit of the 4X zoom.  Much closer than any other camera I've seen.  The autofocus is a little slow in a darker room but very quick under normal lighting conditions.  The camera has auto WHite Balance which works extremely well and the screen is very clear in most lighting conditions.  Outside it became washed out.  In addition to the 4X optical zoom, the camera also has a 4X digital zoom.  You can also use a 6X zoom to view your photos on the screen after they've been taken.  Now on to manual!  You have full manual control with this camera and while I am not a pro, the options are limitless.  The only complaint (not really a complaint, but a preference) is I wish the lens was quieter!  It makes a grinding sound when moving.  This means whenever you zoom or whenever the autofocus kicks in.  You can also feel a slight vibration when this occurs.  I still love the camera regardless and the feel in your hands is much better and more comfortable than any other camera I have tried.  One more thing, you MUST read the manual!  But be prepared to spend an entire evening reading it and another understanding it!  All in all it's worth the aggravation.
