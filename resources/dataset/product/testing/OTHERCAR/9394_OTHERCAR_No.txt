            I loved my Jetta for the first year I had it, and now I hate it!!!!  I bought it brand new, and it now only has 22,000 miles and I feel like it is falling apart! I have had repeated problems with the speakers, now my stereo volume goes up when I try and turn it down, the whole car vibrates, rattles, and the windows whistle as I drive at speeds over 30mph!!!  Going over bumps on the freeway feels like I have gone over a dumptruck.  For the amount of miles and age of my car I would think it should still be very new!!  Of course my warranty is now up since it has been 2 years, and all I want to do is sell the thing.  I had the front seats and side panels on the doors replaced after 1 year because they had faded and turned gray after 10,000 miles.  What a joke!  The car is very cute to look at, the amenities on the Wolfsburg are very nice but I think the car is poorly made.  I plan to sell my car immediately and plan on buying a Volvo wagon.  I had a Volvo before my Jetta and it had 245,000 miles and rode nicer than my Jetta now does!  DON'T DO IT!  I think you will be disappointed.  <br><br>
