            I recently bought the Casio EXILIM EX-S2 because I wanted a camera which I could literally slip in my pocket and yet have good enough pictures to print or view online.  I've got a decent SLR and so I wasn't looking for a very high resolution or optical zoom. 

Once the camera arrived it was clear that all my expectations had been met.  It's absolutely tiny, and I've found myself having to double check to see if I've actually got it in my pocket at times!  Despite being so small and lightweight the build quality is excellent, with a solid brushed metal case which I inadvertently tested when I dropped it by accident a few days ago.  It fell 4 feet onto concrete and survived with only a minor scratch, I won't be trying that again though.

It is also incredibly easy to use, and the initial set up takes minutes, and you can learn just about everything you need to know from the display screen on the camera.  Plus the startup time is very quick, taking about a second from switching it on to taking a photo, so it really is 'point and shoot'.  There are a number of options on the camera itself and you can choose from 6 'best settings' to adjust the cameras settings in a variety of conditions such as low lighting or outdoor scenery.  These are simple to apply, and can alter the effects significantly.

There is a 4X digital zoom, but like all digital zooms it's not really worth using as it simply reduces the quality of the picture.  The software provided enables easy and rapid transfer of pictures onto your computer for storing and editing.  Even if you plug in the cradle without the software it's still easy to download pictures as the computer recognises the camera as a separate drive, which is handy if you're traveling round and using other people's computers, also meaning there's no need to buy a separate card reader.

As for the picture quality, overall it's very good, considering the size of the camera.  I tend to use the highest setting and have been very impressed with the results.  The only things to watch are the focal length (there's no macro so you need to be several feet away from your subject) and the slow shutter speed which can mean shots can be blurry in low lighting.  It also struggles with bright natural light, and shots of the sky on an average day will often appear mostly white.  That said, the normal colours are bright and sharp and as long as you're not after professional pictures, this will more than suffice.  My advice is not to try and save on memory by lowering the picture quality, just buy more memory (it's getting cheaper all the time) and keep it on the higher resolution, that way you've always got the quality if you want to print the photo. 

The flash is small and won't fill a whole room, but is fine for taking the usual indoor snaps.  The camera also has a self timer as well as several flash functions including red eye reduction.

There is a movie mode (without sound) which records AVIs of up to 30 seconds.  The number of frames per second, and picture quality is understandably low, but it's a great little feature and I've used it surprisingly often.

The 12MB built in memory is generous for a camera of it's size, and with a decent sized SD card you should be well equipped for going away.  I currently use a 64MB SD card which stores around 75 pictures at the highest resolution, which is ample for most occasions.  The LCD screen is very bright and clear and allows you to view your photos, edit and delete them, as well as transferring from card to inbuilt memory or vice versa.

The lithium battery recharges very quickly and lasts an impressive amount of time, even with continuous use of the LCD screen (which you can also turn off).

Overall this camera is ideal for slipping in your pocket and forgetting about until you need it.  And when you do it's ready instantly to capture those memories.  However if you're looking for an all-rounder, and this will be your only camera, then consider investing in a 3 megapixel camera with optical zoom, such as the Casio EXILIM EX-Z3 or the Canon Ixus 400 (expect to add $200 to the price though!).  But if you already own a good camera for those occasions when you really need the best quality, and want something economical for everyday use then the EX-S2 is the perfect product.
