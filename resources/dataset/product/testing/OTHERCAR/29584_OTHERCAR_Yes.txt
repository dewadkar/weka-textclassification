            My family recently purchased the new 2000 Nissan Quest.  I absolutely love it! From the outside it doesn't even look like the typical frumpy mini van that i have seen so many times in the past.  It's pretty funky looking if you ask me.  It comes in all the newest colors, and makes any family the hit of the neighborhood.  

I also like the fact that ours has a television in it on which we can watch videos or play video games, which gives us all something to do on those long journeys! 

It also comes equipped with individual heating and air conditioning, so we all stay warm during the winter months and cool during the hot ones.  It has many wonderful new features, including a 5 cd disk changer as well as tape deck.  You can even change stations, and move to the next song right on your steering wheel, which allows the driver to control these features without taking their eyes off the road. 

I recommend this van to all families, especially those less reluctant to get a mini van in fear that they might look frumpy! This van is quite the opposite and will definitely make your neighbors talk...positively!!<br><br>
