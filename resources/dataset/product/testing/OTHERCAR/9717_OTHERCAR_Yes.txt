            The Infiniti G20 is a great car on paper, and it is even better while driving. Consumer Reports rates it as one of the most reliable cars on the road, and while it isn't as sporty as a BMW, it is still a very good ride. While this car looks fairly small from the outside, the interior is pretty large. It can easily seat four adults, but the two in the back may get a little uncomfortable after an hour or two. The interior is very simple and easy to understand. I have found that interior controls are one aspect of car building that Nissan can do right. 

Since this is a considered a luxury car, there is fake wood all over the place. It looks corny and is starting to peel, but if the Infiniti was new, it would look okay. The seats are comfortable, very similar to the Nissan Maxima. 

The best feature of this car is the engine. For a 2.0 four-cylinder, I haven't found anything with better acceleration. The car revs pretty high, and it is hard to not work the engine, but it does get going pretty fast. The engine gets loud because its being reved pretty high, but other than that, it is a fairly quiet car. The handling is not awesome, but it is a nimble car but again, it isn't as good as a Merc or BMW. 

I would recommend this car for college students and for young people that just got out of college. It is inexpensive, and is very, very reliable. if you are in the market for a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry, look at this car.
