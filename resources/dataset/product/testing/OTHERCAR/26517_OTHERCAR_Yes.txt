            It has been over one year since my wife and I leased our 2000 Chevrolet S-10 pickup.  I have to say that up to this point I have been pleased with the truck so far with very few complaints.  I am going to list for you some of the Hits and Misses for our truck, which hopefully will help you with your truck buying decision. Keep in mind that the model we have is the LS regular cab, short bed with a 2.2-liter inline four.  


Hit- Great Value.  We leased this truck for a song.  It was by far the best deal compared to what Ford and Dodge where offering for similar trucks.  Ford was actually asking for at least $100 more per month for the Ranger than what we pay on our S-10.  Keep your eyes out.  These trucks routinely lease for under $1500 down and payments in the low to mid $100 per month range.

Hit- Reliability.  So far our S-10 has avoided the repair shop all together.  There haven�t been any rattles or pings, and my fingers are still crossed.  

Miss- Cheap Build Quality.   Yeah, there are some spots inside and out that just don�t quite match up and the engine is a little loud, but if you wanted perfection, you�d by a Lexus.

Hit- Looks.   This truck is a good looker, and it�s sleek design seems to draw a lot of positive comments.  I                 personally believe that the black paint, silver stripe and brushed aluminum wheels do the trick.  Big exterior mirrors make sure you won�t miss a thing.

Miss- Speed.  Unfortunately this truck does not live up to it�s look.  The 2.2 liter inline four is adequate at best, that is until you encounter a hill (this has caused many spontaneous quotes of scripture).  Do yourself a favor and fork out the $1295 for the 4.3 liter V-6, especially if you want to tow.

Hit- Handling.  Still the most car like of all the small trucks.  The ride is solid and quite smooth for a small truck, but don�t get me wrong, no weight in the bed can make for a bumpy ride.  Overall this truck turns corners with minimal problems and is great for in the city diving.  Also this truck hasn�t been too bad in the snow.

Miss- Hauling.  This truck�s bed will barely hold a mattress, no really.  A twin will fit, but a queen is just a little two much.  Let�s face it; this is a light duty truck.  It will haul dressers, chairs and the occasional load of mulch.  It�s just can�t handle a full load of lumber.  As for towing, the 2.2 liter 4 isn�t up for much more than a jet ski.

Hit- Ergonomics.  The interior of this truck is well laid out.  The steering wheel hub is small, giving a much better view of all the gauges.  The Radio is in reach of both the driver and the passenger with large easy to see and push buttons.  The climate controls are also easily reached by all and have large easy to understand knobs.  Most dials and buttons can be manipulated even with thick gloves on.  The cup holders are somewhat shallow, so keep an eye on your slurpy.  The S-10 also has cool automatic headlights.

Hit/Miss- Seats.  The seats our S-10 came with are plenty comfy and are tastefully covered in gray cloth.  Unfortunately the regular cab keeps them from reclining.  This is bad for those who don�t like to sit upright all the time.

Miss- Speakers.  These wimpy speakers ruin the wonderful CD player that our S-10 came with.  Don�t play any Van Halen on this stereo.

Hit- Standard ABS.  This helps with insurance.

Miss- View.  Higher and better view then a car, but still not as good as Ranger or Dakota.  The bonus here is easy in, out seats and plenty of headroom.


Summary:  Overall this has been a great truck for the money.  My recommendation for this truck is that it�s great buy for the first time truck owner, or for anyone who needs cheep and reliable transportation.
