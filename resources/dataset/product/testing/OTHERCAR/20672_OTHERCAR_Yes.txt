            As I have said before I love Volvos. I loved the old boxy versions and I love the new, sleek, sexy ones. The Volvo S70 GLT is a dream to drive. It handle well, the ride is silent and smooth, and it looks great too. I have only driven the automatic model of this car (I am not sure if they have a standard option) and despite the fact that it is an automatic, it is still a lot of fun to drive. The transmission has three different driving options that you select with the push of a button. There is one for economy driving, on for winter driving and one for a more sporty feel to your drive. One of the things that I like about this car is the sound system. It has an in dash cassette/CD player with a six speaker system (it might be eight I am not sure) that sounds amazing. The seats are very comfortable, even for longer trips and it has a very easy to use climate control system. A with any Volvo it is EXTREMELY safe, reliable, and long lasting. The only drawback is that some parts are fairly expensive to replace. I highly recommend this car to anyone who has some cash to spend and who wants a good looking, performing, lasting car. Drive safely.<br><br>
