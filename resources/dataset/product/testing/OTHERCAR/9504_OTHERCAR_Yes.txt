            About 6 months ago we purchased a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 Sport with an extended cab. We were starting our own pressure washing business so we needed something that could pull a trailer of equipment weighing around 3500 pounds. Yet we also needed something that could also be our family vehicle. Something that was big enough for a 3 year old child and a weeks worth of groceries. We got it!!! This truck does it all. We love this truck!! It drives great, it's roomy, and not to mention it came with all the options... cd player, power everything, and it looks sporty. The only thing it doesn't have is 4 wheel drive. And for not having 4 wheel drive it still does a great job pulling, and drives really good on snow. We are very happy with this truck and I would recommend a Dodge truck to anyone looking to buy a new vehicle. It is very dependable and easy to handle. We give it 2 thumbs up!<br><br>
