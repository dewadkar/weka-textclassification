            The blazer is quite competent in most areas, I found a couple of options which made my Blazer more comfortable &amp; help to keep it in top shape:

Interior:
The seats are good (mine are the cloth covered bucket seats, power driver side), but didn't have the heating option like the Eldorado - ran across the Conair Body Benefits Heated Massaging Back System (model # 4502ST) at the local Ames dept. store (on sale for $30), thought I'd try one and lo and behold, it fits the Blazer seats quite nicely! (so I went back and bought another for the passenger side. Now I have Heat &amp; massaging seats (not to mention seat covers) that match pretty well. Good thing the Blazer has extra 12V power adapters...

Floor &amp; cargo mats - Two versions work very well:

Husky floor mats - these are heavy rubber-like mats with diamond tread pattern that cover the floor &amp; rear nicely, and collect all the slush and rain and dirt from whatever you might be hauling. They have a lip around the edge which keeps all the dirt on the mat and off the carpets. I use these in the Winter.

Catch-All floor mats - like the Husky product, these are custom fit, and offer the lip around the edge, these are carpet covered (washable) and look a little nicer, I use these from late Spring through Fall. Both were ordered through JC Whitney, with their ubiquitous 10% off deal, one was special ordered, but was still cheaper than most other places I found on the net.

Radar Detector - the Blazer isn't a Formula 1 racer, but for those who like to travel with a little less fear of tickets, the Valentine 1 is the best detector going. Reviewed &amp; highly recommended (see epinions for radar detectors).

CB - the Cobra 75WX ST is a nice little all-in the handset unit which fits nicely in the Blazer's console compartment, plus includes NOAA weather capability (wx should be in the radio - are you listening, GM?) - Bill's CB has good prices - cobraelec.com, bills2way.com

Exterior - as mentioned in Part 1, I wish my Blazer had the ZM5 shield package, will get this added by the dealer (lots cheaper if you buy the car with it installed)

Bug guard - yeah, everyone has 'em, Lund's Avenger is a little lower profile than others and fits my Blazer quite well, under $30 @ Whitney

Mud Flaps - buy the GM molded ones, they fit perfectly (unless you need to have Yosemite Sam telling everyone behind you to &quot;back off&quot; :)

Doorsill covers - I believe some Blazers come with these, mine didn't, so off to the Chevy dealer parts dept. - these balck molded plastic covers protect the doorsills from foot scrapes when getting in and out of the car. Easy to install (they go on with double-sided adhesive tape - no drilling)

Lots of other things are available to personalize your Blazer, but that's my short list, hope this helps, and if you have the choice, get the sunroof!

As mentioned in Part 1, the Blazer is an excellent vehicle for hauling things around (be they kids, camping gear or whatever), offers good drivability and excellent value.

happy trails!
