            The Bravada is the best handling vehicle I've ever owned....it's turning radius is phenomenal; I swear it turns on a dime.  We live in a back-woodsy mountainous area and I wanted a 4x4 to keep me out of mud holes and snow banks.  This vehicle does just that. Mountain roads can be treacherous and dangerous, but my SmarTrak is always there....I think I like this feature more than anything else about the Bravada, but I am quite satisfied with the vehicle as a whole.

There are a couple of things I wish Olds would remedy, however.  The brakes are not the best and I wonder if that is somehow linked to the all-wheel drive feature.  At one point CNN announced Bravada was among several SUV's that were being recalled because of the brake system, but when I called various dealers to check on it they said no....also called factory customer service and they confirmed the &quot;no&quot;.  Sure wish they would have. Also wish they would consider putting the dimmer switch back on the floor; this makes a whole lot more sense than having to remove one's grip on the steering wheel to flip the turn signal/dimmer switch.  Further, often when I dim my brights it knocks the cruise control off.<br><br>
