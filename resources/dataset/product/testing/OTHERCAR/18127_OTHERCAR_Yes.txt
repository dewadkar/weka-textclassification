            <b>Background:</b> My family needed a car that we could drive when there was more than 1" of snow on the ground. We have a Honda Odyssey minivan, and were looking for something that could seat 5 in comfort and had a lot of cargo room, but nothing too big and gas guzzling.

First impulse was to get a Toyota Sienna. The only problem with the car is that it doesn't have the ground clearance of an SUV, plus it's so in demand that the dealers weren't willing to discount it, especially the AWD model.

We needed an SUV. The two choices were either the 4Runner or the Highlander, but the Highlander won out due to it's better gas mileage, better handling, and more comfortable back seat.

<b>Noise:</b> As many people have stated, the car is very quiet. In most cases you can barely hear the engine; it's mostly audible above 2500rpm. The wind and road noise are more audible, but it's still very quiet. You can definitely carry on a normal conversation while driving on the interstate.

<b>Road performance:</b> The Highlander performs pretty well for being an SUV. Granted, it's built on a car chassis, but it holds the road surprisingly well. It's not a sports car, but it feels as good as the Honda Odyssey it's replacing, which was lower to the ground and lighter. The body does tend to roll a little, but it still feels like it has traction, unlike the 4Runner which doesn't lean, but feels like the tires are going to slide out.

<b>Powertrain:</b> The engine (the V6 in my particular vehicle) has more than enough power (~240 hp). While this is still not as good as other SUVs in its class, it's more than enough for non-aggressive driving. The car is still in its break-in period, so I was hesitant to push the car too hard. The transmission is a 5-speed automatic. It is very smooth, but too smooth for my taste; the first-second shift has more slippage than I would like. As for gas mileage, it's pretty decent, not as good as Toyota says, but not bad. On its first tank of gas, it was averaging about 18 mpg.

<b>Seating:</b> All the seats are quite firm; I personally like this, but others in my family prefer softer seats. Space in the front seats is quite ample. The second row seats have a good amount of room, but the legroom is slightly less than what was in my 1997 Odyssey minivan. The third row seat, however, is practically useless for anybody over the age of 8 or so. With the second row seats slid all the back towards the rear, there is practically no legroom. Sliding the second row seats up all the way provides enough legroom, but the floor is at a higher level, making sitting there uncomfortable for anybody over 4 foot. So if you were actually thinking of seating 7 adults in this car, think again. 

Another thing that should be mentioned is that the car is low enough that climbing in and out isn't a chore, as it is on some higher SUVs. (It doesn't need a running board, a la 4Runner.)

<b>Features:</b> The heating system is quick, but too loud if turned above the second position. It uses knobs which feel slightly tacky due to the plastic, but they feel solid. I would have liked the automatic climate control system, but it cost too much =(. For models with a third row seat, there is a vent that directs heat towards the floor in the back, with a separate control knob.

<b>Miscellaneous:</b> I would strongly recommend getting a 2004 model over a 2003 for the standard traction control (VSC). While 4-wheel drive will provide additional traction, it does no good if you can't control it. Contrary to some other opinions, I have not had it accidentally trigger on dry pavement. Another cool feature is the low tire pressure warning system. As for the low frequency effect others have mentioned, being that the temperature here hasn't climbed out of the 30's recently, I have not gotten to open the rear windows to see the effect myself.

<b>Summary:</b> So far, I am happy with the car. It does all one would hope for, with amazing build quality (the doors close with a nice "thump"). I'd suggest taking a serious look at it, and while it may not be for everybody, it's worthy of your consideration.

<b><i>Update (01/13/04)</i></b>: We took the Highlander on a 200 mile trip to drop off the kids at college. (400 miles round trip, about a 3.5 hour drive each way). Here are my thoughts from the experience. I found the pedal position very comfortable; there was very good spacing between the brake and accelerator. While I found the driver's seat comfortable, the passengers in the rear thought the seats were too hard and slightly uncomfortable to sit in for that period of time. (Our old Honda Odyssey minivan had more comfortable rear seats.) The car proved quiet with ample power, and the ride was still smooth with a full load, though bumps in the highway caused subdued jars. There was little road or wind noise. Driving at 80mph with crosswinds, the car felt a little unstable, but it was better than my old Ford Taurus station wagon. All in all, I'm happy with it.
