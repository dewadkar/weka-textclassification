            I purchased a Chevy Malibu sedan from Lucas' Chevrolet in Woodbridge NJ. We've always had good experiences with them. We narrowed down our choices to either a Malibu, Tracker, Cavalier, or Neon. The Neon was nicer than the others, but we had the cash rebate  for Chevy because we use the GM card. We ended up driving out of Lucas' with a new 2001 Chevy Malibu 3.1 liter V6.

Lets start with some cosmetics. This isn't the prettiest car ever. The paint and trim are good quality, but only time will tell what will happen. I do like the hubcaps though, they don't look fake.

Interior isn't the best around. It looks rather cheap. I like the fake carbon fiber trim, only because the alternative would have been fake wood trim and thats simply hideous. The car does have slot of headroom, and the front seats have alot of leg room. The back seat has average legroom. The back seat is stiff! Its like sitting on concrete. We took a 2.5 hour trip to Hartford and got out once during the trip, and my back and legs were killing me after we got out, as well as after we got home. The one thing I can't stand is the headrest in the back. That is not where my head is. Its where my upper back is, and causes me much pain whenever riding in the back. The trunk is absolutely immense, you wonder why they couldn't drop the back seats back a few inches and take some room off the trunk.

There is ABS on the car, which is great in the rain, but I've had better stopping from disc brakes in dry than the ABS in this car. Off the line acceleration is ok, while driving the acceleration is good up to about 50 mph, where it just hits a block. At 50-60 mph you can floor the accelerator and it'll take you about a minute to get to 70, even more time to get to 80. It feels like ages. I get better performance out of my 1992 Dodge Spirit. Handling is average, thought it is rather difficult to turn a tight corner with the car though. Handles more like an SUV than a car.

There have been several problems I've had with the car. First would be the lights, both front and back. Condensation is almost always present in one or more of the lights. I have to dismantle them every few months to drain the water collected in them. I've seen the dealer about this problem, they've attempted to fix it with no avail. Apparently this problem is not covered by warantee, which makes no sense at all to me.

Another problem I've had is with the turn signs. They work one day and don't work the next. Maybe its part of the condensation in the light problem. We also own a Chevy Lumina 97 which experiences the same problem. This could be potentially dangerous. I've contacted my dealer about fixing this problem, But with they work the car will probably be there for a week, and I dont have a week to give up my car for. It will hopefully be fixed soon, considering a family member is getting a new car (Toyota corolla) but doesn't have her liscence yet so she's letting me borrow it for the time being (the car is under my parents name).

The other problem I had is when I attempted to change the wiper blades. Not only are they difficult to remove, but when I removed them I discovered them to be two different sizes. I went to an auto store and showed them the blades but they said they only had one of them in stock, the other was an unusual size. My guess is that Chevy wants you to bring the car in to be services where they can charge you $30 or so for new wiper blades.

That's really all I have to say about this car. I was rather disappointed with the acceleration, considering it is a V6 engine. I've driven in Japanese cars with 4 cylinder engines that had better acceleration than this car. I'm buying Japanese next time.
