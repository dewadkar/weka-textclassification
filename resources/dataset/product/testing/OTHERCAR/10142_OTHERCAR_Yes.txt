            Looking for a smooth riding SUV under $30K? Look no further than the Nissan Pathfinder SE. Complete with CD player and Bose surround sound speakers, rear window wiper and fold-down back seat, you'll find yourself looking to go somewhere at anytime, just to get out and drive it. Driving in the NYC area can be hectic, but the sense of control and safety you feel behind the wheel make the ride that much more enjoyable. 

Complete with a six-cylinder engine, 4-wheel drive, and dual air bags, safety and power is what you want in a SUV on the roads today and you'll get that and much more in the Pathfinder. I happen to love the tan color of my Pathfinder, in fact it's pictured up top, but mine has tinted rear windows.<br><br>
