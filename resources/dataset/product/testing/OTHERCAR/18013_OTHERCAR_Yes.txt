            I bought the 1999 Solar Yellow Club Cab Dakota R/T in June of 1999 because of its performance and styling.  
I have never seen another vehicle turn more heads besides a Viper and I absolutely love the attention that it draws to itself. 
The only thing I do not like about this vehicle is it has been in the shop six times for various problems including engine, transmission repairs and exterior trim problems.  This has caused much dissatisfaction on my behalf, but I am happy the dealer has been able to fix everything with no questions asked.     

For someone looking for an exciting drive in a vehicle that accelerates from 0-60 in approximately 7 seconds, has a stock 1/4 mile time of 15.4 seconds and handles as good as a Corvette then this is the vehicle for you.  

If you are looking for something with a smooth, quiet ride then this is not the vehicle for you.  
If you are looking for an attention grabber with tons of performance and are willing to deal with the Dakota's quality problems then you should step on up.<br><br>
