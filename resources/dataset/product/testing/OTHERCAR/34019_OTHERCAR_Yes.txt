            This is my first digital camera. And I take pride in it.
It has sleek body like the point and shoot camera. And versatile in options. Great body and color. Using this for the last eight months.

Firstly, I bought this camera for its looks and size. Very compact and fits into your pockets very easily. I do not want to carry a big and protruding camera around my neck. This is great in that respect and matter of fact every respect.

Cost is little bit high. But I paid the premium. 

Coming to the technicals. There are so many options. you have options to shoot a moving object(like sports). The option I like most is the movie mode. Its great. We can shoot movies upto 120 sec per movie. I shot New Year 2002 fire works at the Navy Pier in Chicago. They were great. All my friends liked it and they took copies of it. Also you can record voice along with the movie. It was so cool with the fireworks. Even the sound of the blasts were recorded. Then you have options to alter aperture and other picture attributes which only profesionals do ( I never tried and never felt necessary but good to have in your camera. you never know when the high tech options will be usefull).

PowerShot S30 is equipped with a 1/1.8-inch 3.2 megapixel CCD &#151 the highest pixel count of any camera in its class. The S30 creates postcard-size images so densely detailed, the pixilation is invisible to the human eye. We can enjoy all the exciting options digital technology giving you, and get rich, radiant, film-like image quality. 
From close-up snaps to panoramic vistas, the S30's speedy, responsive zoom is right there to make your vision happen. A built-in digital tele-converter takes the 3x optical zoom lens (equivalent to 35 to 105mm in a 35mm camera) smoothly all the way up to 10x. Legendary Canon optics ensure a clear, brilliant shot every time. 

Fun capabilities like Movie Mode and Voice Memo make the PowerShot S30 portable entertainment. We can shoot vibrant, sound-and-motion digital movies  And now when we view your still images in replay mode, you can record up to one minute of commentary that will attach to the image &#151 making photographic memories even more memorable.
You can have vintage looking photos by choosing Black & White feature. Its really cool sometimes.
It has options to move from NTSC to PAL and vice-versa. and also we can charge it at 120v or 240v just by buying a attachment costing $1.50. 

Here another cool thing:
We can make our new PowerShot S30 all our own by choosing the look of the start-up screen and the sounds it makes for start-up, shutter, self-timer and more with the new My Camera function. I love Calvin and Hobbes comic characters and now using it as the startup image. 
All CDs are supplied with the camera and they are good enough.
The accessories are bit costly too (like battery). Which I did not invest yet. But adjusting with the accessories provided by Canon.


My Price:
~~~~~~~
I got this camera for $499.00+Free Shipping+free 340MB IBM Microdirve+free 16MB CFC. Its pretty good deal. The microdrive in itself cost you $130.00. If you buy with american express credit card(not blue), you can 'Price Match' it. If you do not understand this concept (Price Match), call the american express credit card(if you have one) customer service and they will explain it you in detail. it saves you lot of money. You buy this from a reputed dealer(like best buy) and compare it with the cheap internet stores.

Overall, I am enjoying my first digital camera. and I fully recommed it.
