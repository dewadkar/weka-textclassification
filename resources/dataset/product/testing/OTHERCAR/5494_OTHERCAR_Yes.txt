                 I bought my cavalier 2 years ago for $4,000. It rides smoothly and has pretty good gas mileage.  The thing that surprises me most about this car is, at 8 years old this car has no major problems. All I do is routine maintenance and she runs beautifully.  I've made several trips from VT. to GA. and have find the car enjoyable on long trips even. My car only Has one thing that I really don't like. the fan is real loud when the car gets hot,but that doesn't happen often. I will say that this is not a car for families( there to small for that),But this is a great car for someone who is buying reliable used transportation. 

     Another nice thing about my car is that its paid for. This is wonderful feeling I wouldn't have if I had bought a new car.<br><br>
