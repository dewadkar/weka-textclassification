            I bought the Kodak DC200 6 months ago so I could take pictures of my stained glass works.  I send pictures to customers via email so they know what they are getting.  For close up work this camera does a great job but I have found that items appear further away then they really are.  I have started taking more pictures with the digital camera at sporting events and there is a little delay from the time you press the shutter button until the pictures is actually takes so you have to anticipate the action a little. Over all I would buy this camera again but I would spend the extra money and get the zoom capabilities and unless you have a laptop I would buy an extra picture disk if you like to take lots of pictures.  The 4MB disk holds about 10 high resolution pictures. Some of our friends have digital cameras by different manufacturers and more expensive then ours and everyone has commented about the great quality of our pictures. Plus we have saved a lot of money on film processing almost enough to pay for the camera. Last but not least all digital cameras eat batteries. We invested in two sets of rechargables.  It seems like the cameras only use about 10% of battery and they need replacement.  It was that or buy a power cord.
