            The Saab 93 is an outstanding, all-around, multi-purpose vehicle.  I purchased this car to replace my Nissan Sentra SER, (another outstanding wolf-in-sheeps-clothing car), which was rear-ended on the German autobahn.  I love several things about this car.  

First and foremost, is the very large and capable trunk.  It has served us very well on numerous short trips and long vacations.  Next, is the very smooth and powerful 185 HP turbo-charged engine.  This car will get up and go.  

Third, is the smooth 5 speed transmission.  The clutch is light and the shifts are effortless.  Fourth, is the very comfortable interior and smart layout.  The leather seats are comfortable enough to stay the night in and the dash and switches are logically laid out.  

Yes, the ignition key is in between the seats, but this is very logical as it keeps the keys out of your way and would save your knee in the event of an accident.  The road-handling is admirable in grip and shock absorbtion.  The front wheel drive is great in foul weather, and with snow tires in inclement weather it is almost unstoppable.  

This vehicle is a great choice for families, single folks, or anybody who wants a sporty, safe, versatile vehicle.  Look at this vehicle prior to buying a imported European or Japanese sedan.  As an owner of a 1997 900S, the 93 is a vast improvement.  If you want to save money and have a great vacation look into the European delivery.  It is a first class vacation and you get your car close to invoice.<br><br>
