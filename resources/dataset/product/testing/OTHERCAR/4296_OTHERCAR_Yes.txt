            Want a fun little car?  You can do no better than Volkswagen Beetle.

This little car can do it all.  It's handling, while not exceptional, is still quite impressive.  It takes a hard turn to make these tires squeal!  Body roll is minimal, and the highway ride is suprisingly smooth.

Acceleration?  Yep -- got that too.  While the VW Beetle will never be confused with the Viper, its inline 4-cylinder engine gives the bantamweight Beetle suprising zip, while it still retains above-average fuel economy.  The Beetle has low gearing, so, while has plenty of get-up-and-go from 0-60 mph, it runs out of steam around 70 or 80.  But then, you don't buy the Beetle for the racetrack, do you?

Safety?  The Beetle has the same problems as any car in its class.  It's tiny, and that can be dangerous on a road crowded with land-yacht SUVs.  But the Beetle is consistently rated as among the safest in its class -- my local newspaper went so far as to declare it the only truly safe subcompact car.  Like other German-made cars, the Beetle has side-impact protection bars in the doors.  Its center of gravity is low -- rollover is unlikely.  The engine is in the hood of the new Beetles, and is designed to drop out onto the road in the event of a head-on collision (as opposed to coming through the dash and landing in your lap, which DOES happen in some cars).  This makes the hood a crush zone (which is a good thing) if you hit something head-on.

The car has German reliability.  The only problem we have had occurred when my mother bottomed the car out on a gravel road and ripped the oil pan cover off.  We have had no other problems.

Disadvantages?  One or two.  The car is tiny; there is precious little room in the back seat.  The trunk is also small.  But really -- who's going to buy a VW Beetle to haul the kids around?  Also, I hate the climate/raio controls.  I have not yet deciphered how to turn the air OFF.  It is also unclear just how you make the air hot/cold.  The radio isn't quite as hard to work, but it ain't easy.  Our Beetle has a 6-disc changer in the trunk -- I HATE that.  I prefer an in-dash CD player.  But that's just me.

Oh, yea -- Volkswagen built a flower vase into the dash for all you hippies.  Enjoy!<br><br>
