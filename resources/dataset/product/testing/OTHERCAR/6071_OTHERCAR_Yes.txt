                 The E-series is an exceptional car... then again, what else would you expect from Mercedes-Benz.  It's very luxurious and is a great way to travel.  Added features such as 4-matic make it practical in all conditions.  Most people end up choosing between this or the BMW, so I've included some brief comparisons.
    
     In the styling department, the E-series exterior looks distinctive.  You won't mistake this car for any other as it's bearing down on you.  Unfortunately, since it's so popular, you'll see alot of them bearing down on you.  the newer ones definitely loolk a bit cleaner and sportier, which I personally tend to like.

     The first thing that I noticed was this car is very comfortable.  Sitting in ANY seat, you'll never feel that the ceiling is encroaching upon your head, and there is tons of leg room as well.  Even tall people will find this car to be very accomodating.  Additionally, each seat, including the middle of the rear seat, is very comfortable for long journeys.  The driver will have an easy time   finding a comfortable position.  It easily has more room than the BMW 5-series, especially in the rear.
    
     The interior of this car is fantastic.  Most other cars in this class give you a little wood under the radio console, but this car has wood everywhere.  It's a tasteful color that makes the interior very luxurious.  The rest of the dash is fitted with nice plastics that blend well together.  Everything on the center console is well-placed and very accessible to the driver and the passenger.  It houses everything from the trunk release, door locks, hazard lights, radio, dual climate controls, to storage compartments.  Once you get used to the car, everything is in a very natural position.  This dash makes the BMW look rather dated and austere.
    
     As one would probably expect, this car has every concievable option available.  Unlike Acura's, you choose which ones to pick, but even the standard models have just about everything.  Dual Climate control, Memory seats + 
mirrors, sunroof, and rear vents are all standard.  Options include a the COMAND system, a trunk-mounted 6-disc changer, rear shades, and a few other things that most people live without, but are definitely nice touches.  Some nice touches that MB has are steering wheel controls, great cupholders, and the home-link system.  The COMAND system wasn't an option when we got our car, but it's gotten mixed reviews.
    
     The drive in this car is great.  There's no vibration or sound from the time you turn the car on to the time you are cruising 80+ MPH.  In fact, at high speeds, it's very difficult to tell how fast you are going.  The steering    communicates enough information to the driver to know what the road conditions are, yet passengers don't feel a thing.  Given the size of this car, the amount of body roll is quite impressive, although you won't mistake it for a Porsche.  Still, this car's rigidity allows it to be handle extremely well.  As an added bonus, the gas mileage is incredible.  We got about 25 MPG in the city and 30+ on the highway.  If you get the 4-matic, the car becomes great for the winter as well.  As good as the MB is, the BMW still feels a bit sportier and is a little better on curves, but this is truly nitpicking.
    
     The 3.2 L engine delivers enough horsepower to make it fun to drive.  The BMW 528 feels comparably sluggish.  You'll never feel that the E-series is struggling to accelerate.  Still, although there's ample power available to you, it's doesn't feel like a rocket taking off.  If that aspect is important to you, then the E430 would probably be the better choice for you.
    
     In terms of safety, the MB once again is a winner.  The car is solidly built and the chassis seems extremely strong.  I wouldn't worry about being hit in any direction.  In addition, it comes with the side airbags and entire airbag-like curtains for the front and rear passengers.  The brakes (w/ ABS) to a great job bringing this massive car to a full stop.  Traction control also    helps this car on slick surfaces.  The 4-matic system gives added security, and we have had no problems at all.  This was a major winning point over the BMW.  Lastly, if the car is ever in an accident, someone from MB calls you to make sure that everything is okay and will send out help if needed.  
    
     There are a few downsides to the E-series.  The most important is the extremely small trunk.  The rear seats have an incredible amount of room, which has come at the expense of the trunk.  It basically stops where the trunk lid stops.  You can easily fit 5 people in the car, but don't expect to carry all of their luggage.  The second gripe I have is that there's no in-dash CD player.  When Suburu's and Acura's are installing 6-disc changers in the dash, there's no reason why this E class doesn't have it.
    
     So, basically I think that this is a great car.  You will pay alot of $$$ for it, but you'll definitely feel like you are getting a well-built car that will last.  It is better than the 5-series in terms of space and overall luxury, but comes in a close second for driving pleasure.  Still, with so much competition out there, the question becomes whether the step up in quality is worth the extra price for either of these cars.  Ask someone that owns one, and they will tell you that it definitely is.
