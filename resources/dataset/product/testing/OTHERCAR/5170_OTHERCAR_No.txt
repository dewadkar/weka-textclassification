            I've never been a Chrysler fan, but their styling has made me look and re-look at most of their offerings in the past few years. I was well aware of the automatic transmission problems which have plagued Chrysler, but that beautiful new Dakota styling just kept luring me to stop each time I passed the local Dodge dealer. I finally succumbed to temptation and drove a new Dakota sport.

I was neutral on ride and unimpressed with comfort- but that styling seemed to make up for it. So... with mixed emotions I reasoned I couldn't have transmission problems with a 5-speed and the best match seemed to be the V6- reasonable power and better fuel economy. 

I brought the Solar Yellow beauty home with high hopes to a wife who was equally enchanted by the styling. Unfortunately, the Dakota's beauty was only skin deep. Within weeks it became apparent that fuel economy was going to be horrible- between 12 and 14 mpg with a 6 cylinder engine and 5-speed transmission. While power was adequate, this was no hot rod considering the engine's thirst for fuel.

The first time I took a high-speed freeway on-ramp with slight pavement irregularity I thought the rear axle had fallen out from under the truck. The truck &quot;hopped&quot; sideways in a VERY unnerving fashion. I soon discovered this was &quot;normal&quot; for the Dakota and have since talked to several other late-model Dakota owners who all complain about the &quot;twitchiness&quot; of the rear suspension on uneven pavement.

Then the reliability problems began... little things... and big things. At 6,000 miles, for instance, the catalytic converter failed completely, rumbling like a dump truck and strangling engine power. Dodge replaced the converter under warranty, but not before I was without vehicle for several days. 

The seats which seemed &quot;acceptable&quot; during a test drive became increasingly irritating. Without the club-cab the seats sat too upright and were too narrow for my 250 lb. frame. 

At about 8,000 miles, after several other problems we sold the truck to a friend who had admired the styling as much as we had. I was relieved to be rid of the poor economy, unpleasant ride, uncomfortable seats and the mechanical uncertainty.

The friend has since had a second complete catalytic converter failure at 12,000 miles- again doing without the truck for several days pending parts. Fuel economy has never improved and the &quot;nervous&quot; ride has gotten worse as suspension components have accumulated miles.

I replaced the truck with a Toyota and the difference is like night and day. The Toyota has never been back to the shop, is incredibly comfortable, has a solid, reliable ride and gets better fuel mileage with a much larger engine. 

I should have listened to my gut feelings rather than being swayed by a pretty face!<br><br>
