            We bought the SW2 based upon the fairly reasonable price, and the additional space provided by a wagon. Also, the advertised high-end dealer experience &amp; decent reliability was attractive. Unfortunately, these pros quickly turned into cons!

We ordered the car in one state to be picked-up in another -- no problem, said the dealer. After arriving in the new state, we waited a number of weeks past delivery date (with no other car available to use!), calling the dealer on a regular basis as to status. It turned out the local dealer had the car, but did not bother to inform us. When we went to pick up the car, the famous Saturn walk through did not occur -- just a &quot;here are your keys -- see ya!&quot;. 

The worse happened approximately 9 months after we took delivery. Approximately 1/2 mile before merging onto the Interstate, the SW2 died. Brakes; engine; lights; steering; everything! Had this occured on the freeway, we surely would have been injured (or worse!). But it continues to get worse!

The Saturn dealer COULD NOT DETERMINE the cause of the problem. Working on the car for over a week, they could net tell us why it happened, and that it would not happen again. In addition, the service department somehow did further damage -- while the engine was basically disassembled, one of their staff &quot;started&quot; the car, shooting a rod through the head! They basically had to rebuild the engine! So, Saturn could not tell us why such a dangerous problem might occur; they could not tell us it would not happen again; and they did further damage to the car!

Because of my lack of comfort driving a car that could die at any time, we told Saturn they would have to purchase the car back -- being fair, we only expected Blue Book wholesale -- yet they offered us thousands less, stating that the &quot;Blue Book was too high&quot;. Many discussions with the dealer (they were not polite or helpful) and with Saturn headquarters (they were polite, but not helpful) we had to take the hit. With a pregnant wife, I was unwilling to risk her or our baby's safety!

My sense is that we had a lemon. My primary issue was with Saturn NOT taking responsibility in any manner -- actually attempting to blame us for the problem -- and forcing us to pay for their lack of business ethics.

Who should buy this vehicle?? Anyone satisfied with a well priced, mediocre, potentially dangerous automobile. Everyone else, look elsewhere!<br><br>
