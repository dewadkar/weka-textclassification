            The Polaroid PDC-640 is the best electronic investment I have made in the last year!  It is affordable, easy to use, and takes great pictures.  I don't have the floppy disk adapter, but the serial cable only takes a few seconds to download each photo.  The LCD is very clear and I love the fact that this camera has a self-timer so I don't have to be excluded from being in the pictures.  No need to spend hundreds of dollars to get high quality; this one's got it.  If you do run into a problem ( I had a slight software conflict), Polaroid's tech support is great.  It's one downfall is that the batteries don't last very long, but you can save money by purchasing some rechargeable AA's.  Anyone interested in purchasing a digital camera should look at this one first!<br><br>
