            My first digital camera had two shortcomings that the Kodak DC 220 corrected:  no flash and no zoom.  I received the camera the day before a Christmas party, and didn't have time to read all the instructions.  The batteries came with the camera, so I was able to pop them in, turn on the camera, and get started.  Unless you change the setting, the flash is automatic, and works wonderfully.  My first pictures turned out perfectly, with just the right amount of light and no &quot;red eye&quot; effect, even without using the &quot;red eye&quot; feature.  The cycle time for taking the subsequent pictures is noticeably faster than my previous camera, and the LCD viewer has substantial brightness and clarity.  The zoom feature is a very nice touch - it has 2X optical and 2X digital - but I would prefer at least 3X optical.  Zoomed images turn out very clear, with rich color - even those taken at maximum optical and digital zooms.  Downloading the quality photographs is a slow process, so I purchased a separate flash card reader that connects to the parallel port of the computer.  It transfers the photos up to 20 times faster than downloading straight from the camera.  The included software is cumbersome to use; the image editing software from my previous digital camera is much better, so I use it instead.  The camera does have a tendency to consume batteries in short order, but a battery charger and rechargeable batteries solves that problem.  The camera has many advanced features, such as time lapse, quick succession photos, and other features that I have not had time to explore yet.  But, based on my early experience, this is an excellent camera.  I just returned from a trip to South America, where I took 220 photos in a variety of settings:  indoors; outside in the rain; from buses, trains, and airplanes.  All turned out exceptionally well, and I received many requests for electronic copies.  You will not be disappointed with the pictures it produces - I printed an 8X10 of a photo taken on the medium setting, and it turned out very well on my HP Deskjet 890 printer.  If you want a megapixel digital camera at a moderate price, you will do well with the Kodak DC 220. <br><br>
