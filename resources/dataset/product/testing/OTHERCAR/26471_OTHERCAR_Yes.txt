            I was looking for a very cheap digital camera to use as a  trainer before I spent $500 on one.  I got this one with a rebate deal and didn't expect much.  The 1st few pictures we took on Christmas morning using natural light looked really great.  The next few with the flash looked terrible. The faces were white-washed.  My first reaction was that the camera was junk, but then I read the manual.  I adjusted the exposure properties and I've been taking great pictures ever since.  

I would compare this camera to an inexpensive automatic 35mm with flash. It has a low shutter speed value so it would not be good for action shots.  I have several friends who bought high priced 2 megapixel cameras a year or two ago and the picture is not quite as good as those, but very close.  

It takes two AA batteries and I learned quickly that you should buy some rechargeables.  I also bought a 128mb SD card that will hold around 180 high res pics so I can take the camera on week long trips and not worry about changing cards.

One of the only bad points I can think of, if you are taking pictures in low light, the 1 inch lcd screen is unusable so you have to use the traditional viewfinder.  It is sort of like using one of those disposable camera viewfinders which makes it very difficult to frame a shot properly.  It really needs some frame etchings on the lens to help you line it up.  But it doesn't cost you a cent to keep trying till you get the shot. :)

One other thing, the camera doesn't like to share the memory card.  When I put the card in another camera and then swapped it back, the 2040 would not recognize it.  I had to use my pocketpc to erase the directory the second camera put on it. 

Bottom Line: If you are in the market for an inexpensive digital, this is a good camera.
