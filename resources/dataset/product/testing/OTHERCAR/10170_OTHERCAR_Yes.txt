            Becoming a new mom this past summer meant changing many aspects of my life, including the sporty Audi A4 2.8 I had been driving.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited we had was not for me.  I am petite and wanted a comfortable &quot;car&quot; with room to fit a stroller in the back.  We looked at the new Jeep and I was very disappointed.   One feature I wanted was vents for A/C and heat in the back for the baby.  After looking at the Ford Explorer, Jeep and Mercedes SUV I was disappointed in the features offered.  I originally was not interested in ever driving a Lexus..To me it always seemed to shout, glorified Toyota.  But when I went to see the 2000 Lexus RX 300 I was immediately enthralled!  It was designed with a petite woman in mind!  It is lower to the ground so lifting things in and out ws much easier.  It handles like a car, a great transition for someone used to driving small cars. It comes with many standard luxury features, including:
*auto window down and up
*electronic seat adjustments
*6-cd changer in the glove compartment
*auto climate control(the Mercedes did not offer this)
*seat warmers
*vents in the rear(the Jeep was either hot or cold back there)
*Adjustable rear seats(they move up and back)
*Auto-sun roof
*Leather/real wood interior
In addition the center console has excellent storage space(for spare diapers..etc...) and it was immediately comfortable and easy to handle.

The safety features include air bags and side -reinforced steel beams...I got the 4-wheel drive.  It has excellent steering control and pick-up.

I am not a car expert but I know what I like..and I love my new car.  Yes from the outside it does look like a big station wagon, but that is great for the person not ready to step up to the monster size SUV.  The 2001 model is basically the same..it may have the GPS system in it.
I did not buy this car for the &quot;L&quot; on it, in fact I never thought I would have even looked at the Lexus...but I am very glad I did!
