            My name is Jerry and my wife Kelly and I bought a new GMC Sonoma Extendcab in July of 1999. This is probably the best investment we have made since we have been married. The Sonoma Extendcab has a third door that makes shopping a breeze! No more chucking the groceries in the bed of the truck like we did with the old toyota we had....now we just open up the third door, conveniently located on the drivers side, and put them in the ample space behind the seats! And the room! Sitting in the toyota gave the impression that you were about to fly through the windshield at any moment....but on the Sonoma it seems they used a bit of that cab forward design like on a pontiac and you never feel cramped...and this is a small truck! We got it loaded wth the SLS package with CD player and suspension package..and after the rebates....we walked out the door satisfied that we got the best deal possible, and had a quality machine that will last a long time.The dual air bag system is a must and it comes with a shut off for the passenger side in the case that a child may be riding there....but to tell the truth...a child will fit comfortably on the rear fold down seat which is equipped with a shoulder harness in addition to the lap belt. As the years go by and the paint fades ...rest assured that ..as my body shop owner brother in law assured me, rust will be a minor problem. He tells me that GMC truck bodies are all galvanized.
A little paint in 10 years or so wont be a problem. Gas mileage is comparable to our four door sedan midsize, about 23 miles to the gallon in the city and 29 on the highway....i have checked it. It also has a theft deterrent on the cd/radio that is password protected to stop functioning if the power is interrupted...and will not come back on 'til the pass word is punched in so at least a thief will not get any use out of it. The styling is great and it is an overall wonderful truck...kudos for GMC on this one.<br><br>
