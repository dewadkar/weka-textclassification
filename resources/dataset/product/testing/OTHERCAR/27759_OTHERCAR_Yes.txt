            The Elph is a great APS camera.  It is small, comes in many different forms, and has lots of options.  I love it.  The Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph has all the same qualities packed into a digital camera that is small, light, and easy.

I bought the camera because I hate scanning images.  It just takes to long.  Since I have the Elph already, I bought the Digital Elph.  I am impressed with how it has handaled so far.

The Elph has 2.1 mega pixel quality, a nice zoom lens for the size, and a monitor that can be turned on or off.  You would not expect a camera the size of this one to have 2.1 mega pixel quality, but it does.  Some cameras have the montior turn off feature, and that is good because it saves battery life.  The zoom lens may not be the best compared to Sony's but it is good enough for a small camera.  The Elph is also really easy to use, everything happens at the touch of a button

There is only one thing that is not that great is the battery life.  The batteries last for maybe 40-50 pictures and then you have to replace them.

The digital Elph is on the lower end price range for this type of camera.  It only cost me 550 dollars.

The durability is average for a digital camera, I don't suggest throwing at a rock, off a cliff, or into a lake, river, or stream.  Maybe you could take it skydiving, but lets leave it at that.

This is a great, small, somewhat affordable camera that you can take anywhere as long as you carry extra batteries in your pocket.
