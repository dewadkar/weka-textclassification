            when you first see a type-r you'll notice the beautiful wing on the back that limits the view out the back,you'll notice the sweet front spoiler that scraps driveways,the white wheels that get dirty easily but its worth every penny.the type-r is nothing even close to the GS-R vtec model.
the type-r is lighter,more powerful,better handling &amp; looks,shorter gear ratois,higher redline,even carbon fiber on the dash,but you get no sunroof.the type-r reacts much better to modifications also.i've seen gs-r
integras with turbo's that cant match a type-r with a few bolt ons.a 
type-r with a cold intake,header,and a vtec controller with good tuning can put the R into the 13's,where i seen gsr's with turbo kits running 5-7
psi still in the low 14's.theres a night and day difference between being 
in the vtec range and being out of it.let the needle run up to 5800 rpm and the story changes.it literally screams louder and louder as rev keep climbing to its 9100 rpm redline(the dealer says 8600 but thats not true)
one drive in this car and you wont wanna park this car.this is another car thats got bang for the buck<br><br>
