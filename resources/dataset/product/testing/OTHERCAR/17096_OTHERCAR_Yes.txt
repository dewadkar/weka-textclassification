            Mercedes usually makes great cars that last forever, but this purchase was terrible.  I have a 1999 ML 430 and have had nothing but problems with it.  After taking it in for a regular service, the gas started to leak from the fuel line because someone forgot to tighten it.  After that more and more problems came about - the washer fluid line started leaking, the console went out, the odometer stopped working, and the fuel meter stopped working.  The latter was <b>quite</b> a disaster!  We had no idea when the fuel was going to run out - so we had to be constantly taking it to the station to refuel because we didn't know how much was left.  Not only that, but at the same time the trip meter stopped working, so we couldn't even tell by how many miles we had driven.  I must say that the M-Class is a huge disappointment.<br><br>
