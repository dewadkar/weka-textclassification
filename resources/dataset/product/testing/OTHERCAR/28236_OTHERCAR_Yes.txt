            There's no way to tell you, in 75 words, of my well planned Durango purchase.  However, I promise if you take the time to read this, you will be sold as was my husband, the anti-Dodger.  So read on.  You'll be glad you did.

Having six children (all boys) and much Boy Scout activity surrounding our lives, my husband and I decided to purchase a Ford Aerostar mini van in 1989. Which, might I add, accomplished what we sought after for the kids, trips, etc..  However, they grew up and in 1996, we decided to search for something for the two of us.  Something less bulky yet with adequate interior space (we were spoiled by the room in the mini-van).  We knew one thing in our search, due to technology, the car shopping experience had changed.  No longer were we destined to put on our boxing gloves in preparation for the Dealer's &quot;salesman of the year&quot; pitch. For now, we had the INTERNET to investigate, research and ponder, from a single sitting position, what automobile, would be best suited for us.

FIRST STEP
Gathering information from the sites of auto makers, various dealers, and automobile sites was an adventure but after diligent information internet search, one thing was evident, Edmund's home page was &quot;THE RESOURCE&quot; and offered a wealth of consumer automobile purchasing &quot;how to&quot; advise as well as automobile information and statistics.  We considered this invaluable information and a milestone in the auto seeking process. 

SECOND STEP
Finding an automobile (and we were in no hurry). Little by little, we narrowed our search and in 1998, we concluded that we liked the increasingly popular SUV.  This was just what we were looking for.  We further narrowed this search to the largest selling vehicle in the SUV market...the Ford Explorer.  Consumer Reports (1998), rated this car as the best priced vehicle in its class.  We did some internet searching and pricing and just as we were ready to make a decision, I saw it!  And I knew the minute I saw it, this would be MY choice in SUV's.  The style was without rival to any other in its class (Dodge has won awards on their style).  I admired the style on the Dodge Ram Truck but wasn't interested in the truck...now here it was, this awesome style slapped right onto an SUV .......the Durango.  I went onto the Edmund's home page day after day, researching and comparing room, torque, mileage, safety, options, height, width, price, you name it, I researched it.  One feature was definitely a PLUS and that was the third bench seat.  Six boys meant........
....grandchildren.  I needed that third bench seat! Only one problem remained, 1998 Dodge Durango came in 4 wheel drive only, an unnecessary option to have in Georgia (also an option notorious for being a gas hog!).  

THIRD STEP
I prayed this awesome looking vehicle performed as well in a test drive as it looked in appearance, so we took the plunge.  The plunge wasn't an easy one, for Dodge/Chrysler had not earned a great deal of respect from my spouse thus nearly having to drag him to the local dealer....until the moment of truth - the test drive.  My husband was sold!  Comfort, optimum interior space, third seat, roomy, comfortable seating, wide windows and the style I loved that only Dodge offered.  The vehicle choice was a done deal.  But wait...only available in 4 wheel drive?  The salesman advised 1999 would offer the Durango without 4 wheel drive!  YES! YES! YES!  Back to the internet for a great 1999 deal.

THE FINALE
In April, 1999 after more internet searching, we did it.  We found the right &quot;no haggle&quot; dealer, got a GREAT deal (thank you, Edmund's for making me an educated consumer!) on the ever so stylish Dodge Durango - with ALL the options.  A N D it is everything we bargained for and more.  Beside the overwhelming comments we get on the beauty of our Durango, people are amazed at the great price of such a gorgeous automobile.  My husband is so impressed with the product that he is buying one (different color of course) himself!  Imagine that?  This guy who was the Anti Dodge, loves my Dodge Durango. He's converted! 

But by far, one of the most impressive things about my SUV which was a surprise to him, was the gas mileage.  Besides requiring an 87 octane (he thinks this is cost effective) he recently took a trip to West Virginia and averaged 19 mpg.  Nuff said.  He's in love and I got one heck of an  awesome vehicle.<br><br>
