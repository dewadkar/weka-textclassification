            Unfortunately, I am a college student who needs a car and can't afford to spend much.  I bought my GMC Jimmy thinking that I was buying a safe, reliable, economical vehicle.  This was dead wrong.  First, the gas guzzler is back - in comparison to the 1986 Grand Am that I was previously driving - this Jimmy eats gas.  Be prepared to only get about 15-18 miles per gallon max.  This is estimating on the high side!  Numerous little things have gone wrong including problems with the brakes, alternator, tire gate, and little plastic pieces.  My car only has 21,000 miles and is a 1997 model.  To me - that is ridiculous.  The only thing covered under my bumper-to-bumper warranty was the alternator.  As far as safety, the car is crap.  I was rear-ended by someone going 5-10 miles per hour and there was $1500 worth of damage.  The entire passenger side of my car buckled in various places.  I would hate to see what happens with a worse accident.  Various other nuances include the gas gauge has gone out twice.  With as little miles as are on the car - I am still astonished.  Don't get me wrong, the car looks good, but only buy it if you stand all these little &quot;inconveniences.&quot;  I saved money all through school to buy a reliable car, I feel very disappointed in that I could have put the money into a new engine for the old '86 grand am and been better off.  Buyer, please beware.  <br><br>
