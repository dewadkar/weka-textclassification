            Hi, whenever we thinking about buying a new car , we want right price and worry free later on. My whole family, they all driving Honda, my sister got Honda Civil 91, and my brother in law got a Honda Civil 95, and my older brother got a Honda accord 96. When I was 18 and got enough money to purchase a car, all I want is Honda, I got a Honda accord 97 right now, I love it, because here are the things I like about it:

1: Reasonable prices
2: safe gas (full tang only $16, and last till 425 miles on HW and 390    miles  in City. )
3: Worry Free (All the Honda car I and my family driving it right now, never break down, even my sister Civil 91, she got 150000 miles on it, and trust me she doesn't know how to drive it or take care of it)
4: Lot better stereo speakers compare with other cars (I'm music lover, I need music while I drive)
5: extremely easy to add a cd changer into the cassette player. 
6: Really comfortable on low ,mid or even high speed driving.
7: If you are drag racer or like to modifying car, you will love Honda car, because they are so many performance parts for your engine or many styles body kits and wheels out there for you to choose.

Above is just some of things I like about it, if you want me to list them all they will be really long. I love the safe gas and worry free parts because gas now is expensive, if the car break down it's costly to repair it. 

there is one thing I don't like about Japanese made cars is that they easy to dent, beside that you know that Honda car is make to last and reasonable price for us. The people should buy this car are those you want a car that reasonable priced , last, worry free, know that the car will take them there and back home safely.<br><br>
