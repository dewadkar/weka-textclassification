               I purchased this camera 16 months ago while stationed in Afghanistan. The environment was very dusty, and I knew that whatever camera I bought would have to be able to withstand the dust and a few bangs and bumps here and there. I already had the original Canon Elph, the Advanced Photo System film version, and was very happy with the design and durability of that camera, but wanted to upgrade to digital. So the S200 seemed to fit the bill. I havn't been disappointed since.

   The first thing you notice about this camera is it's tiny size. Even after 16 months, this is one of the smallest zoom cameras on the market. Many other cameras look smaller from the front, but are very thick. Canon's design seems to be proportioned perfectly for pocketability. Other notable features are the use of a rechargable battery (some competitors use Lithium batteries that cost $5 each), and the use of a CompactFlash memory card, which is not as small as other formats, but seems more durable and is still very popular and inexpensive.

   Turn the S200 on and the bright LCD screen shines to life, and the camera is ready to take pictures in about a second. buttons are small, but spaced enough so that even larger fingers find their target easily. For simple snapshots, the camera's fully automatic shooting mode works great, taking clear, balanced pictures. If one chooses, however, many of the S200's options may be manually set to the user's liking. Also available are special effects like black&white or sepia tone (antique) photos, or a special mode for taking a long chain of pictures across a vertical plane which can be automatically stitched together upon uploading to computer (think 360-degree landscape shots).  The auto-focus system can be slow at times, taking as long as 2-3 seconds to find the perfect shot, but the great picture quality that results makes it all worthwhile. Some say that performance is dark situations is poor, but I strongly disagree with that, and have found my pictures turn out great in all sorts of conditions.

   It should be noted that I have never used the included software, opting instead to use a CompactFlash --&gt; PCMCIA card adapter to transfer images directly from the card to my laptop, no cords required. So I cannot comment on the quality of the included software.

   If you're looking for a stylish, small, go-anywhere camera that takes great snapshots with a few extra perks, look no further than the Canon S200 digital camera.
