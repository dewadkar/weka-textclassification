            I bought this van after shopping for another vehicle after my divorce.  I have 3 teen-age boys (growing rapidly) and a toddler around frequently.  I shopped for many different vehicles including Chevrolet Suburban, Expedition, Tahoe, etc.  After considerable shopping I fell in love with the Astro Van.  

This van has plenty of seating (fits 8 comfortably) and has plenty of room�even for growing teen-agers &amp; full-size adults.  I found it had a full frame under it (none of the mini-vans have this feature) and is still a rear-wheel drive vehicle (which again, none of the other mini-vans have).  I found it is classified as a mid-size van versus the full-size or �mini�-vans which are so popular.  

I�ve had this vehicle almost six months with NO problems mechanically &amp; only 1 minor problem � the overhead console has a button which keeps popping out every time I open it to get my sunglasses.  

The only drawback I�ve found when driving this van is the limited amount of footroom due to the fact that, as in all vans, the wheel wells come in on the front driver/ passenger compartment.  It still had more room than the other vans I drove.  There is plenty of room for the passengers in the 2nd and 3rd seats.  The 2nd seat folds forward for extra room and you can fold the 3rd seat forward or remove.  The drawback to this is the 3rd seat is extremely heavy &amp; hard for 1 person to put back (I had to have my teen-age son help me put it back).  

Seating is extremely comfortable, the front seats are high-back bucket seats with adjustable back positions and lumbar supports, and armrests.  The lumbar supports are easy to reach and adjust.  The driver�s seat is electronically adjusted (front/back/up/ down by switches that are easily reached on the lower right-hand side of the seat.  The second &amp; third bench seats both comfortably fit growing teen-age boys as well as the full-size adults who have sat in them.

The heat (front/rear) and air conditioning (front/rear) have done extremely well in their respective capacities and are quiet &amp; easily managed.  The rear-wiper works well.  The heat/air and wiper controls for all are easy to reach/manage.  The dash lighting is excellent and there is no problem with seeing any of the gauges.  

Side view mirrors are electronic and controlled easily by the driver with the flip of a knob.  

Gas mileage has been 16mpg in the city and 19-21mpg on the highway, which is what the dealer�s sticker stated when I bought it.  

I have and will continue to recommend this van to family and friends.  The price, compared to other vehicles in its class, was extremely reasonable.
