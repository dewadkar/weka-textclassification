            My husband and I were expecting a baby, so we traded in my little sports car for a 96 Mercury Sable GS.  I thought it was wonderful at first - power windows, locks, seats, etc.  It has a CD changer, tape deck, premium sound.  It had all the bells and whistles.  Within a week of buying it, the oxygen sensor went out.  After that, the transmission and overdrive went out.  This car was only 3 years old when I bought it!  
I did my research in Consumer Reports before buying it.  I had a few bad marks on it, but overall it was a good buy.  Thank goodness for an extended warranty.  
Now, my husband is always working on it.
The car rattles and vibrates everywhere.  The windshield whistles.  There is something wrong with the brakes, and it wasn't fixed last time it was in the shop.
I love the size of the car.  I love the features.  I love the color and design.  If only the mechanics of the car were better!  I don't recommend this year model of the car.  It was the first year for this particular body style and there are too many bugs to count.<br><br>
