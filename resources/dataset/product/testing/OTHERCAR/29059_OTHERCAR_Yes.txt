            My first car was a 1989 Ford Tempo. That was a miserable mistake of a purchase. After somehow surviving several months with that thoroughbred lemon, I bought my 1992 Chevy Corsica in February 1996: bright blue, with 77,000 miles on it. It cost $5800 at the time. 

Totally unable to depend on that Tempo, which broke down with major problems like clockwork every weekend, I had to get new transportation before I left home for college. My mother already had a '91 Corsica (which worked like a charm until we recently traded it in with 180,000 miles on it for a '98 Malibu), so I knew what I'd be getting.

This car is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Four years and 50,000 miles later, its 3.1 V6 still purrs like a kitten. I've always been thankful for so much power in a car this size--it's ready and willing to squeal the tires and leave people in your dust whenever you want to! It's fun to drive on curvy roads as well--its steering is easy and responsive. 

Now with 127,000 miles, it has had some growing pains, nothing too serious though. The a/c had to be recharged, the muffler had to be replaced, new brake rotors, and a new front wheel bearing. It's now just beginning to show some age in the paint department, with several small, barely noticeable areas beginning to rust--typical for a car its age. It's still a beauty though. Cars of its design are beginning to look older, but it still looks contemporary enough. If it didn't have such a fun, brilliant color, it would probably look less modern. It looks sporty and reasonably stylish still.

I attend college in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, and even on the coldest days of the winter, my car starts right up. Often, my Baby Blue is the only car in the lot that WILL start in the winter!

I'm going to cry like a baby if I ever have to get rid of it. It's like a dependable best friend.<br><br>
