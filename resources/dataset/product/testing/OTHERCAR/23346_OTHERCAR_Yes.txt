            Having only owned my 2000 ML430 SUV for a couple of months, I thought it was time for us to have some quality time together, a chance for us to bond.  So I called one of my best friends and suggested a road trip to Vegas, one of my favorite cities in the world.

So we left Dallas on a Tuesday and just started driving.  Neither one of us had ever been to Vegas via car before.  The entire trip was such the adventure.  The ML430 made the trip very comfortable.  In some of my previous vehicles the trip would have been a horrid time.  For example, I wouldn't have even considered making a cross-country spontaneous journey in my old Porsche Boxster, not a comfortable car.  But the Mercedes SUV was perfect for traveling.

The on-board navigational system really helped us get back on the road when we would decide to get off the highway and explore a small town along our trek to Sin City.  I highly recommend this feature.

My friend said he had a vision of us driving through the vast wastelands of nothingness of Arizona running out of gas or overheating, but it never happened.  We both decided that we felt so safe within the shield of Mercedes Benz.  Being not the great driver that I am, I can not even begin to count the number of times the wonderful braking system avoid a wreck. 

Not only did the ML430 handle fabulously on the interstates, but also on the city streets of Las Vegas it handled even more fabulously.

I am convinced this is the best car I have ever owned and would highly recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
