            We bought this car about six years ago. It was my family's only vehicle for over four years, and it works just fine. It has taken us from the central part of the country to a lot of places including California, Texas, and the summits of Colorado, putting on about 20,000 miles per year. We are currently trying to sell this car for about $3,000. Our Eagle Summit got around 40 miles per gallon on the highway and 25 miles in town, because of it's small size. This car is very dependable, but is not as smooth as our 1993 Eagle Vision, which is much nicer than a Summit. This car is probably for someone who does not want to pay all the money for a new car and lots of high-octane gas all the time<br><br>
