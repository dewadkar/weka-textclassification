            Last fall, my husband and I found ourselves needing to purchase a new car.  Since we couldn't afford a brand new car, we found ourselves at our towns many used car lots.  At a little lot, among many less attractive vehicles, we found our 1998 Mercury Tracer GS.  It's a very basic model - no bells and whistles, but on test driving it I enjoyed it quite a bit!

It's a zippy little car to drive.  It has lots of &quot;get up and go&quot; when you need it to.  The instrument panel is very easy to see - key elements are not blocked by the steering wheel.  The car we purchased is a 5 speed manual transmission, and shifting is very easy.

I am short-legged, and my husband is long-legged, so often we have a hard time finding a car that fit us both.  The Tracer did just that.  I have no problem reaching the pedals, and still have space between me and the steering wheel.  My husband is able to put the seat back as far as he needs to and there is still room in the backseat.

My daughter is a toddler, so we needed a car that fit her carseat as well.  No problem.  Both of our carseats fit in the car very well.  The fact that the car is a four-door was a definite necessity, as our former car had been a two-door.  Getting a kid out of a carseat in a 2-door is truly a headache/backache!  My daughter really likes having her &quot;own door&quot;.  Since she's our only child, we have her seat in the middle, but in transporting some of her little friends, we have had the opportunity to try it in the side seat with another carseat on the other side.  Both seats fit well.  It would be difficult to put a third carseat in the middle though.

This car gets terrific gas mileage.  I am getting 30 to 35 mpg in the city, and a little better on the road.  With gas prices these days, this is a must!  The car has been very dependable too.  When we purchased it, the car had just over 13,000 miles on it.  Over the course of the past year we have put 17,000 miles on it without any repairs!  Considering our history with used cars, this is a miracle!

The car isn't very fancy.  The upholstery is nice, but not plush.  Seats are adequately padded, but not as comfy as a higher priced vehicle.  The sound system is great for the basic user.  The cup holders in front aren't very big however, and frequently my drink won't fit in them.  I solve that by putting the cup on the emergency brake, which works fine.  There is a cup holder in the center in the backseat, which has proven to be very handy for my daughter's sippy cups.

The car has a 40/60 split rear seat, which has enabled us to transport larger items when necessary. I like this feature.

Overall, we've been very pleased with this car.  It's economical, easy to drive, and meets our needs.  I would recommend this car to a young family with a small child or children, or a college student.  <br><br>
