            After searching and searching for a vehicle, we decided on the Jeep Cherokee  and what a great choice it was.  We test drove it and fell in total love with it.  The ride is smooth, the cloth seats are very nice, it is a very roomy truck.We have a 1999 and it is loaded.  It is a 4X4 and in upstate NY with all the snow we get, you sure need it.  It has no problems going through the snow and getting into 4 wheel drive is very easy, you do this from inside the vehicle.  <br>I totally think this is a great truck to have.  We have taken it on long road trips and it was an enjoyable ride.  The back of the truck is roomy and has enough room for luggage, animals or whatever you need to bring along.  <br>We leased this and will buy it or lease another one when the lease is up.<br><br><br>
