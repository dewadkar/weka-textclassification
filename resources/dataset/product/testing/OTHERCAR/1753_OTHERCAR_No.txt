              About 5 years ago, my parents purchased this car in hopes of having something that could last them a good number of years without having too much work.  They figured that Mazda's were really good cars and that they had made an informed and well-educated choice.  But just a couple months after buying it, they realized it was going to be more work than it was worth.

  After about a month, things started to go wrong.  The engine began to make a lot of noise, the brakes started to squeak, and things just seemed to be getting worse and worse as the days progressed.  Over the first two years, they had to replace the brake system, get a new muffler, and even put in new shocks.  Luckily, the car had a two year warranty.  

  After all this was over, they thought that the car would be okay...wrong!  Pretty soon the same problems started to reoccur and new ones formed.  The computer system in the car failed and had to be replaced.  The air conditioner broke.  The steering had to be adjusted just about once a month.  Nothing seemed to go right.

  It's been five years and thousands of dollars of work, and the car is still having problems.  It is known in my family as "the lemon".  I guess we'll never really know if it was just this one car or the model, but from what we have seen, it is not a winner in our book.

  Even with all these problems, there are some nice features in the car.  One of the nicest things would have to be the good cornering and acceleration.  It is almost like a sporty car mixed in with a family sedan.  It also has a pretty smooth ride and a good feel when something isn't broken.  The car definitely isn't all bad.

  If you want to take a chance on a car, then go for this one.  Just be careful to check everything closely to make sure that there are no real problems.  Make sure that you don't make the same mistake that my parents made.
