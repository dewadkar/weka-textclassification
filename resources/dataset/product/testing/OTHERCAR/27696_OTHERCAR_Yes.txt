            Slick is the one word that comes to mind whenever I think of the 1996 Eclipse.  The one that I got has a CD player, turbo, sunroof, and nice leather interior.  

Fist I�ll tell you about the inside.  It�s amazing.  CD player works great with a little bass.  But my favorite part of the inside is the sunroof.  It can open half way, or you can slide it all the way back.  It�s also a stick shift.  At first that was my main trouble.  I hate driving them.  But after a few days I realized there are more good things about a stick then there is bad.  You get better gas mileage, and with the high prices of gas today, that a huge plus.  The car has power lock, power windows, and an alarm system.  

Second I�ll tell you about the outside.  The car is a major low rider.  Which has its good times and bad.  Low riders always look cool.  But going through dips and driving in the snow are a big pain.  But all you�ve got to do is drive slow when you come up to dips, and just drive more careful in the snow.  The low rider part isn�t too bad though.  All together it�s a sharp looking car; it�s very good looking.  I have a black one.  Which means I have to wash it more often, but it�s a good color for this type of car.   

I bought this car for 9,900.  The car dealer I got it at had this special deal where you trade in your car and it takes off $2,000 off the car you�re going to purchase.  This helped a lot since the car I originally had was a Nova and was worth around $100.  So with the $2,000 took off the car, it would be $12,000.  But I bargained my way down to 9,900.  And for a nice 1996 black Eclipse, that�s a good price.

This car is a very nice car.  It�s a smooth looking car and it drives nice.
