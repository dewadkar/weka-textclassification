            When my husband bought his 98 Jeep Wrangler SE, I basically disappeared for a couple of months. :)  It is his BABY....which is understandable - it's a great vehicle, for OFF roading.

We bought this vehicle because my husband liked the idea of being able to drive down the road, and if a proper trail was spied, have the ability to drive off the road.  We lived in the Sierra Nevada foothills at the time, so these opportunities came up often.  There really isn't anything like that freedom.  I remember one day in particular that found us in the middle of a green forest parked next to a babbling little stream, (we did stay on the original trail however.)  If I had tried that in my Honda Civic...I'd probably still be there.

This vehicle is a blast to cruise around in.  With the top off and the wind blowing, so much is exposed that you feel like you could almost fall out of the jeep.  It has a very tight wheel base, so twists and turns are very easily maneuvered, but that same tightness means you have to keep both hands on the wheel at all times, (the steering is very touchy.)  In the summer, this thing is F U N!  In the winter, it gets you through the harsh weather.

Now, on to the things that may prove irritating to a new and unsuspecting Jeep owner.  Like to pass people?  Like to maintain speeds over 40 going up hills?  Like a quiet ride?  DO NOT BUY A JEEP! (Not the SE anyway, I'm sure a Sport with a hard top is a different story.)  We have an SE with a soft top.  I'm going to list a few drawbacks here:

-No more rolling windows up and down.  Get used to zippers.

-Like to drive around with the top off?  Better make sure there is absolutely NO rain in the forecast, because once it's off - it's off.  the tops on these things are not particularly easy to take on and off.  (Although I hear they have improved greatly over the years.)  If you buy a hard top, the difficulty factor goes way up.  Evidently, you need some sort of hoist to take it on and off?  (I'm not sure on this.)

-The engine is under powered.  It's geared for off road driving, so you have to keep it in the high RPM's to maintain speeds up hills....or to accelerate at a decent rate.  Although it has plenty of torque for off road use, it is not geared for the street.

-There is little storage space unless you take the backseat out.  Not to mention the security factor on anything you put in the Jeep.  With a soft top, it's all out in the open.

Now, I'm not saying all of this because I don't like Jeeps.  I love my husbands Jeep, though I would never own one myself.  These are all things you have to take into consideration when shopping for one.  Also keep in mind that there are SO many after market modifications that can be done to your Jeep to accommodate a lot of the negative things.  You can purchase lockboxes for security purposes.  We bought a KN&amp;N Air Filter to boost horsepower a little bit.  We also purchased a sun shade to put over the top for our summer road trips.  With the addition of 30&quot; Pirelli Scorpion tires, we were able to give the jeep a bit of a lift without a lift kit, (not to mention they look awesome.)  And this is just the beginning.  Many people catch the bug and pour thousands of dollars into modifying and accessorizing their Jeeps for off road purposes.

A Jeep has character.  It says something about the person driving it...portrays a bit of a wild, rugged side.  It's like going on Safari every time you get in the thing.  But you have to respect it for what it is.  It was originally designed as a military off road vehicle and it still maintains that classification.  So, now that you're prepared - go out there and test drive one.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.

Oh, one more thing.  You know how motorcyclists wave at each other when they cruise by on the highway?  Jeep owners do the same thing - so look in the mirror and practice your best wave.<br><br>
