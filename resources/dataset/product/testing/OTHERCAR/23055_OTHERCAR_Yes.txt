            My husband gave me one of these cameras for a Christmas gift. I love it! It is so easy to use. The picture quality is great! He also got me an 8 megabyte memory card for it. Now, I can take lots of great pictures without worrying about emptying the camera when away from home. I simply insert another empty memory card when the first is full. A digital camera saves from paying for prints that you don't want. If you don't like the way a picture turns out, simply delete it and take the picture again. The software that comes with the camera allows retouching of photos and other alterations. 
Loading your pictures to your computer is done with cords that attach to the back of your computer and the other ends into the end of your camera. The process is quite simple. An accessory that allows you to use your floppy disk drive to dump the pictures into the computer can be purchased as well. This accessory would make putting your pictures in the computer a breeze. 
I don't have anything bad to say about this camera at all. It is a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
