            Refined. The 328Ci Coupe uses BMW's 2.8L I6 engine to power her into the next lane. The 328Ci hits 0 - 60 in 6.6 with the Manuel (Standard equipment) or 7.2 with the Steptronic transmission. The Steptronic has been flying around for a few years on cars. What makes it interesting is that you can put the car into Drive (Automatic) or you can shift with no clutch. This option is useful when driving in the city. Also the 328Ci comes with almost perfect weight distribution. 

The Exterior Styling on the 328Ci is quite impressive. From the front end you could almost mistake it for a 5 series (there are a few small differences). When you take a side view you see a totally different, much sportier looking coupe. Hit the Rear and you take a glimpse into another dimension. The Back of the Coupe is probably the best view. Nice styled Rear Lights, and a two piped single exhaust positioned on the left side make it. If you also have $3,495 you can add an Aerodynamic Kit. This adds new Front Underbody Spoiler, new Side Sills, new Read Underbody Spoiler and a Rear Spoiler. It adds a nice and can be installed as a Dealer option. The Standard wheels are 5-Spoke Cast Alloys (16 x 7.0) that are somewhat appealing and the beautifully styled M Double Spoked Cast Alloys (17 x 7.5 F, 17 x 8.5 R) are amazing and worth it. The M wheels come in your Sport package which also adds Z Rated Tires and nice Front Sport seats with higher Thigh Bolsters.

The Interior Styling is also impressive. What makes this interior different from the rest is placement of buttons. Everything is designed for ease of use and to keep you safe. Coming slapped on you 3 spoked Steering wheels is audio controls, a phone control (Phone is optional through your Dealer) and some others. Your window controls are placed next to the shifter. They are all(4) 1 touchers. A nice touch they added was rear power windows that push open about an inch for ventilation for the passengers or just nice to open when there are blue skies and a bright yellow ball in the sky. Going up a little higher are the Heated Seat buttons (If you ordered them). Climbing another step higher is you Climate Controls. Easy to use Digital Interface adds a nice touch. YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK TO MANUEL CLIMATE CONTROLS AGAIN! Still going higher comes our last step. Its either a AM/FM/Tape Player, AM/FM/CD Player or a GPS Navigation system that has a AM/FM/Tape Player. All very easy to use and sound great. I have tried out the GPS Navigation System on a friends car and at first I was in a state of confusion then became quite used to it and enjoyed playing with it. If you don't want a In-Dash CD Player go for the Navigation System. Although with the Navigation System you can add a Dealer Installed BMW 6 Dish Changer. Slide Left of you wheel you come to your standard controls and a Instrument Brightness Knob which is another nice touch. Change your Instruments for Orange to Red. As with almost all BMW's the Center Console of Controls is slightly Tilted towards yourself; the Driver which allows for easy viewing. The Cockpit Ergonomics are beautiful, Comfortable and simply breath-taking. Your front Seats are a little stiff without the Sport Seats. The Sport Seats add higher thigh bolsters and a much more comfortable ride. The Rear Seats are comfortable but if you have a 7-Foot Giant Don't try to fit him in. It is comfortable for kids and mid-sized adults. 

The Inline 6 Engine is terrific. Most people do not need any more power or speed than the 328Ci offers. Hit 5500 Revs and experience 193 Horsies thrusting you forward. If you are really into high speeds the electronic limiter is set at 128 MPH, yah I know your probably depressed. The Gas Mileage is decent at 18 - 40 MPG depending on driving style, conditions and type of roads driven. The Inline 6 is excellent. Although if you don't want all that power you can go down to the 323Ci and get a 2.5L instead of 2.8L's of displacement. 

If there are only 2-3 people in you family this car is perfect for you. Any more and you really pushing it. Over all the Engine performs well, the styling is excellent, the Interior is luxurious and comfortable and overall a great car. If you can afford the price tag get yourself one. Although you have to be flexible and be willing to pay almost or MSRP. The Dealer can try to find you one but you might not get your interior color, or a minor option. BE FLEXIBLE. If you want to have one built by BMW just for ya expect a 3-5 Month wait. Also trying to find one with Premium and Sport package with almost every option is a difficult task. Fortunately I have gotten one. Hopefully you will experience what I have with this car!
