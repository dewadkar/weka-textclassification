            The Olds Bravada is a great truck to own and operate. It moves in and out of traffic with ease and has great eye appeal. In my quest to purchase a SUV, I drove the Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, the Jeep versions (what a joke), the Chevy Blazer and Honda Passport. The one thing that caught my attention right away is that the Bravada has lots of room for a big guy. (I'm 6'5&quot; tall) I felt really cramped in the Explorer, Jeep, and Pathfinder. I was also impressed with the creature comforts that come standard with Bravada that are options on the others, including the sister truck Blazer. Those comforts are leather seats, lumbar supports, and excellent stereo system (even includes a 6 disc CD player), and heated power seats.
So far I have not found anything to dislike about my Bravada, for I find it a pure joy to drive. If a person is looking for a SUV with class, and performance this would be the one to buy. If you are following the crowd, you might overlook this good looking great vehicle.<br><br>
