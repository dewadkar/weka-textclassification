            I had trouble from dealer, on registration-Tennessee said &quot;can't help you&quot;.Recent repair-transmission slipped,engine uncontrollable,all lights came on (except alternator). Saturn repaired it, said it was alternator. car was in shop two other times for different problems, &amp; repairs sounded fishy. I am a aircraft tech.,former mechanic at a Ford dealer-I know of hidden tech. bulletins with&quot;for your eyes only&quot; classifications. I believe, from reading other opinions here, and from my experiences,Saturn has costly defects,they should pay for.I told Tennessee that this car has forced me to buy my first foreign car,that's sad with almost fifty years of buying cars-they must think we're all ignorant.  <br><br>
