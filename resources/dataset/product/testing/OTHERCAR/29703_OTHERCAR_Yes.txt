            Simply stated, I love my car. It is a 1995 Subaru Legacy and it has a few dents here and there, but I can tell you from first-hand experience that Subaru Legacies are well-built and very safe cars. I acquired my Legacy in November of 1997 and, because I was irresponsible in my youth, I was promptly involved in an accident with it 2 months later. The underside of the vehicle had to be completely redone, and the front end had to be worked on, (dents/scratches/etc) but all I had to show for the accident was a slight bruise where the seat belt restrained me and a rather large bill for repairs. 

You might think that 'normal-to-tall sized' people will not be able to fit in this car. This is not the case. I would like to point out that the front seats can be adjusted for rather tall people. While I happen to measure in at 5'2&quot;, my boyfriend who is 6'4&quot; is able to sit comfortably in the passenger seat and is also able to drive my car. While I cannot envision him sitting in the back seat (the only drawback to owning a compact car) some of my other friends who are 5'5&quot;, 5'8&quot;, and 5'9&quot; ARE able to sit there. 

Another thing that might be of note is this: when you drive the Legacy, you really don't realize how fast you're going. This easy, quiet, smooth-driving car is great when you have the cruise-control on, but always keep an eye on the speedometer if it is off. You might *think* you're going 55, and it might even *feel* like the car is moving slow, but in reality you're more than likely doing 80. (Something else I found out the hard way.)

Well, some other things you might want to know: When I acquired my car it had approximately 42,000 miles on it. Currently, I have a little over 87,000 miles on it and it still runs well. (Considering the accident and all.) I do have a little more wear and tear on it than some other people do, as I use it everyday and, for a little over a year, I made constant trips between Long Island and Boston, but these things are to be expected. All in all though, it is a great car and I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, reliable, SAFE car. 

(If I neglected something that interests/worries you about this car, feel free to ask about it! If I don't know the answer offhand, I'll be sure to find the answer for you later!)

Thank you.<br><br>
