            Our family bought the vehicle because our old car, a Mercury Grand Marquis. died. It needed quite a bit of work to get it right. So after much research we selected the Plymouth Voyager SE. It handles very well. Turns corners very quickly, much like a sports car. It has plenty of room. I can carry 6 singing teenagers and their costumes very comfortably. It seems to have plenty of power. It gets on to the highway easily. 
It does have an annoying problem. It leaks through the rear seatbelt openings. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with a family or who has a need to carry several people.  <br><br>
