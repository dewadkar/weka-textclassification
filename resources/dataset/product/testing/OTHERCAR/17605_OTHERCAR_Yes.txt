            I bought my '98 Plymouth Neon used in 99 from a now defunct AutoNation dealership for just under $9k (excluding TTL). Overall, I've been pretty happy with it, minus a couple setbacks.

My little 4-door accelerates quickly off the line, unless the A/C is on. Handles very well, brakes well too. Mileage leaves a little to be desired. On the highway, with the A/C off, I can squeeze 30-33 mpg out of the engine. Expect around 23-25 in the city, and as low as 20-22 running the A/C full blast (about 8 months of the year in Texas).

Within a year of purchase, I had to replace both the engine head gasket and fuel pump, both of which would have cost a pretty penny if they hadn't been covered by warranty. Since then, no major problems that weren't partially of my causing (in 2001, rebuilt transmission after hitting a bump in the road drained the trans fluid - note to readers, this car is fairly low to the ground).

Haven't had much rust to speak of - a tiny bit in a couple places where paint was chipped off.

Overall, at 110,000 miles and counting, this has been a pretty reliable little car. Mostly routine maintenance has kept it performing solidly. Decent bang for the buck.
