            Last summer, between my dependable old Volvo and my current Camry, I made the mistake of buying a Mazda 323.  This is a tiny little car that is no fun to drive.  This car is a disaster.  It rattles and shakes terribly.  It�s so lightweight that it blew all over the road with a strong gust of
wind.  The seats were extremely cramped and my knees were in my chest! I disliked driving even the smallest distance.  It had the most horrendous vinyl interior.  

Now, you may be asking, if I didn�t like it, why did I buy it?  The answer is simple: necessity.  My dependable Volvo was on its last leg and I needed a new car before it died.  I didn�t have any car credit, and I am a student, so I didn�t have a whole lot of money.  My Volvo was a present from my parents, so the notion of a car payment was completely foreign to me.  I went to a dealership that was willing to finance this poor student.  I stopped the salesman dead in his tracks when he tried to sell me a Pontiac Grand Am. I wanted to see the least expensive thing on the lot. And there it was: the Mazda 323 and a decrepit-looking Dodge Colt.  So, I opted for the lesser of two evils, and went against my better judgement.  (May I advise all of you to NEVER go against
your intuition...) 

Two days after I sign away my life for this raggedy car, the air conditioning quits.  Mind you, it�s August in Virginia.  No a/c is not an option.  That was my only requirement for a car.  The dealership and service center are about 40 minutes from my house.  That ride was like being in Hell.  Really.  Anways, I digress.  The service people fix my air conditioner, and I must say, it worked great in the tropical humidity of Virginia summers.  Another good point:  the gas mileage was unbeatable.  However, I was driving to the service people every other day to get something fixed: the console fell off, the lining of the trunk broke off, there were shorts in the electrical system, my steering system was all messed up.  I don�t know if this is representative of Mazda
quality or if I got a fluke, but I will never even consider another Mazda.  

The car dealership got so sick of hearing my voice on the telephone complaining about everything wrong with the car that they told me to bring it back and pick out another one.  I had no idea you could exchange a car, but I wasn�t complaining.  So I upgraded to my Camry (see
my Epinion on that, if you like.)

If you are broke and need a cheap car right away, then this ugly little 323  is perfect for you.  It was noisy, undependable, and unattractive. It barely got me where I needed to go, and for the two months I had it, I spent more time with it at the shop than in it!<br><br>
