            I bought a 1990 Chevrolet Z24 as my first car.  It initially cost me $2000 but that figure has since crept up to nearly $10000 due to my stupidity (I keep repairing it rather than dumping it in the nearest scrap yard).

The first thing that happened to the car was the roof leaked water whenever it rained.  I couldn't fix it, nor could the Chev dealer or the two-bit shop from where I bought it.  I tried to seal it up with silicone, now it only leaks a little, but it still leaks.  

Then, in the dead of winter, the heater core stopped working, and it cost $400 to have it replaced.  Since then, the heater core has failed again (just 25 days after the warranty on the other one expired).

The right front caliper seized on its own, wearing down the brake pads, and costing me $600 dollars to replace the entire brake assembly.  This happened three times (once on the left side)  but I only replaced the calipers twice.

Then the hose burst on the lower rad, then the alternator stopped working, the water pump began leaking, the CV boots were ripped on three different occasions (for no apparent reason) and one CV joint had to be replaced because of this.  My front struts needed replacing, the power steering pump failed, the A/C developed leaks, then it began to lose oil (and I couldn't figure out where because there were no leaks, or blue exhaust smoke).  Then the oil pressure sending unit broke and I replaced it ($200).  The fuel pump broke down one day, leaving me in the middle of the downtown core spewing dark grey clouds of smoke into the air, and barely able to drive (that one cost me $600 with towing).

Then one day I lost power, the shop claimed it was the clutch, so I replaced it ($800).  Later that day after the repair was done, the catalytic converter broke clean off on one side, so I had to fork out another $400 to replace the entire exhaust system from front to back including the muffler and all pipes (this was the second time I did this with this car).

Combine all these repairs with the cost of towing, and car rentals, high insurance rates, etc, etc, and you're much better off buying a newer and more reliable car in the first place!  (see my review of my '97 accord coupe).

As for performance, there are no complaints. The car handles like a dream, peels out from a dead stop, and overtakes trucks on the highways easily.  Powered by a V6, 3.1L engine in 5 spd, you really enjoy the drive (on those rare days when it actually works enough to drive it).  The trunk is huge, and the seats fold down making plenty of room for whatever you want to tow.  The seats are very comfortable, visibility is great (even from behind).  Everything in the car is large and sturdy, typical of Chevy cars.  

Simply put, this car would be amazing if it actually worked for any finite length of time.  Since it didn't, I am giving it a failing grade in my review.  My advice would be to buy this model while it is nearly new, and sell it at the first sign of trouble.  By the way, my car is rusting out right before my eyes!  The bottoms of the front doors are especially troublesome as these doors are nearly impossible to replace (due to the fact that there are no doors out there with no rust on them).<br><br>
