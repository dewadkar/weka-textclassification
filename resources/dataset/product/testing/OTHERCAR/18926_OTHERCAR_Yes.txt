Samsung 800K is by far one of the smallest digital camera (without a build-in LCD screen) out there in the market. The major reasons for me to purchase this camera was:

1. It is about the average price for an entry to middle level entrance. At a  
    price of $150 it comes with 2mb smart media card which soon being 
   replaced by a 16mb card which can hold up to 220 pictures (the most I 
   have taken picture with this camera is 220 I am sure it can store more 
   than that).

2. 800K is the only camera it in the sub $150 that users can put a lager  
    memory cards in.

3. It takes 2AA battery and should last about 20-30 shots (using NIMH  
    rechargeable battery.

The operation of this camera is exactly what I expecting for, processing time is a bit slow (10 secs per picture) and the recharge of the flash (15 secs). This camera offers no zooming capability and the macro do not work all the time.

I would recommend this camera to an entry-level-lets-wait-and-see-how-it-goes type. The actual 'real photo print' (from yahoo's photo printing service) came out PRETTY GOOD (I forgot what size I order but I believe it's one of the standard size). I was impressed with the quality of the picture (I guess the combination of the camera and the printing service).

This is a break down of why would one need a digital camera (just in case you need more reasons to convince yourself).

My theory:

Regular camera
1. Average 36 exposures film cost $6.00
2. Average 36 exposures film processing $6.50
3. Average 'GOOD' picture(s) from 36 exposures film 5 +/-

Digital Camera (Digimax 800K)

1. Camera $150
2. Memory card $29.99 (buy.com)
3. Cost of picture processing around $0.60 +/-
4. Digimax can store 200 +/- images 
5. Choose any 'GOOD' image(s) and then order what you want in the long
    run it will be CHEAPER than trails and errors
