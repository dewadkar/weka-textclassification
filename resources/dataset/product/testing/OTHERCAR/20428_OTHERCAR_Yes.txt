            <B>History</B>
I got a VW Jetta for the summer of 2000.  Since then it has taken me both through cities and on errands and even from Michigan to California.

<B>Pros</B>
This car clearly demonstrates solid German engineering and never rattles or shakes.  The interior instruments and controls are well placed and intuitive to use (at least for the basic interior).  I have a 5-speed stick-shift and it is a pleasure to use.  It handles well and has nice features, particularly concerning the rear seats.

<B>Cons</B>
Really the only thing that doesn't feel top of the line is the rear seat.  The backs are too straight and there isn't quite enough head-room (I'm a standard 5'10").  Also, in the front seats, unless you sit far enough back, you may find that the dashboard is disturbingly close to your knees, which is not a good thought in the case of an accident.

<B>Handling</B>
I love to use the engine as if I'm on a motorcycle and take it through high RPMs.  The Jetta has quite a bit of zip, and I'd even go so far as to say I wouldn't mind a sixth gear.  Though first gear can be a bit tricky from a standstill, the rest are smooth as butter and as much fun as a racecar.  The suspension is naturally tighter than you'd find in a cadillac, but this makes you feel that you're driving something much more sporty and gives good feedback, especially while taking turns at reasonably high-speed.  During the cross-country drive from Michigan to California I got up to 90 mph and the car took it in stride.  Needless to say I was quite impressed.  The brakes are pretty standard; I'm satisfied and wouldn't change them.

<B>Interior Layout and Features</B>
The console is layed out naturally (the radio is very nice) and if properly seated everything is just within reach.  Things that gave me a pleasant surprise include the adjustable angle of the arm-rest, the clever fold-down seats and trunk access, and even the cup-holders (though they aren't the most robust I've seen).  I was also impressed with how adjustable the front seats are, especially the height adjustment in addition to front-back adjustment and seatback lean.  The air conditioner is a bit weak but this can be countered by leaving it on a little longer.

<B>Reliability, Safety, and Maintenance</B>
Other than one worrisome mishap that turned out to be just a fuse that needed replacing, I've had no problems with the Jetta (at least, nothing caused by the car or it's manufacture).  As far as safety is concerned, you don't have take my word that it's safe, you con look it up elsewhere.  I will say that it did get five stars (the highest possible) for safety and comes with front and side impact airbags.  I'm not sure what it has for the rear seats but I will say that both the rear window seats and the rear middle seat have both shoulder and lap seat-belts, also known as 3-point harnesses.
