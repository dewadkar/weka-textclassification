            I have twins and another (yes I'm a lucky mother!) I needed room for all the car seats. I purchased a 1996 Dodge Caravan because I thought it was the sportiest model of all the vans I looked at. I got the Candy Apple Red - yes it is a cutie!!! The sticker price was $23,000 but I was able to get it for $16,900. It has cloth seats, gray in color, integrated car seats which are the biggest joke ever, am/fm radio cassette, ac, rear window wiper and defogger and that's about it on the extras. I had problems with the integrated car seats. The buckles kept jamming and I could not get my kids out. I brought the van to the dealer several times. I was told not to let the kids eat in the van. Crumbs can clog the buckle on the car seats. I never let my kids eat in the van because I worry about them choking while I am driving. I try to keep the buckles on the car seats very clean but they jam anyway. Eventually, someone's kid gets stuck in the car seat and has to be cut out. It's in all the newspapers and Dodge finally puts a recall out on them. Too little too late Dodge! Thanks for nothing! I also experience trouble with my brakes. They scream and grind something terrible. The dealer replaces them three times. Thank heavens the van is still under warranty and it doesn't cost me anything. I still worry about the brakes and don't feel safe driving the van. My next gripe is the paint job. It is horrible! It scratches easily and everything leaves marks and dents it. I worry about the resale value of the van.The conversion of the van is not easy to do. The rear seats can be removed but weigh a ton. One person can not do it alone. Although, I love the roominess of the interior, I do not think I will be purchasing another van from Dodge. The overall quality is very lacking and they do not stand behind their product.   <br><br>
