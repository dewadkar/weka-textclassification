            The 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 4x4 with the 5.2 litre Engine is a major sleeper. The only thing telling you this is the V8 is the Badge on the hatch and the rumble of the exhaust.  Watch out!  The power of this thing is great in such a small, meneuverable vehcile!  Also, the towing power is great too.

   The Jeep V8 can tow over 6,000 pounds without trouble for usch a small vehicle.  This car is all motor!  Just press the accelorator and you're off in a flash.  The transmission shifts smoothly and without hesiatation.

   The dissapointing parts of the Grand Cherokee is the interior storage/space.  It was dissapointing to find cargo space was significantly less than the 1991 Ford Explorer 4 door I used to have, but hey, that's what trailors are for :).  Other dissapointing parts are interior build quality and panel fit and  short term reliability.<br><br>
