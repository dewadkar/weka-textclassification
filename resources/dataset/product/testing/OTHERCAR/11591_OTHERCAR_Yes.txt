            Having been in a near fatal car accident recently, I researched safety quite a bit before deciding on my Rodeo.  A loyal Honda owner, I test drove the CRV first, but the Rodeo is an SUV, built on an SUV frame, unlike the CRV, which is built on the Civic chassey.  There is not a lot of call for a 4WD in North Carolina, but 5 days after I bought my Rodeo we got 16 inches of snow.  My new SUV had no problems.  As a matter of fact, when the weatherman ordered everyone inside, I loaded up the dogs and started pulling people out of the blizzard.  I couldn't be happier with the performance, the four-wheel drive, the winter-drive, towing power, and great looks and style of my new Rodeo.  To all of you out there trying to wade through all of the available SUV's, go for the Rodeo!!  Stylish, safe, durable, smooth running, affordable, and beautiful!!!
