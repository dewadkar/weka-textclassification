            I bought a midnight black 1998 Pontiac Firebird in June 1998, and it's been the smoothest ride I've owned. Mind you, I've owned the 1980 Silver Anniversary Edition MGB, a 1993 Nissan 280ZX, and the bomb of all bombs -- a 1990 Cutlass Ciera. I know you're asking yourself how that Ciera fell into the mix, but after driving in that tank for 4 years, I owed myself a treat. 

At $20,000, the base model, 2-door, rear-wheel drive hatchback totes a 3.8 V6 (200hp) engine with T-tops and hug-the-road tires. The interior is roomy and the 4-inches that Pontiac shaved off the length makes it an easy car to handle. The catalytic converter rests in the passenger side floor, which makes it uncomfortable for any passenger to stretch their feet.

Believe it or not, this muscle car has a back seat that can barely fit a 12-year old, and when you move the seats forward to accommodate the back seat passengers, your chest will be in the steering wheel.

The only problem I have faced thus far is the headlight motor blew after a year.

I've clocked the mileage around town at 19mpg, and on the highway about 23mpg. The dealer told me to fill it up with regular unleaded because he claimed it didn't run any different on premium fuel. So far, so good.

This vehicle hugs the road, looks sharp and gives you a cool, smooth ride. The Pontiac Firebird is a pleasure for anyone looking for an inexpensive, sporty car who doesn't need to worry about high-maintenance.
