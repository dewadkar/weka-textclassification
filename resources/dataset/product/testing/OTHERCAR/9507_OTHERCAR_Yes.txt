            We bought a used 1997 Dodge Ram Quad Cab designed by Custom Coaches.  It is the best looking, classiest vehicle on the road.  It handles great and is roomy and comfortable inside.  The gas mileage is not good on the 8 cylinder, but the pick up is great.  It has all the comforts of home and is priced reasonably for all the extras.

You feel very powerful driving this truck and looking good.  Everyone who has spirit should by this truck.  I have seen many types of people driving the Ram, from young to old and every age group.  My kids and grandkids love to ride in it.  My husband and myself are very proud owners.  Sport one around for awhile.  You'll never go back to driving a car.<br><br>
