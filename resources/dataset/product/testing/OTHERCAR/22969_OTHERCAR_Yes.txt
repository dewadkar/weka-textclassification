            I have always wanted a digital camera, but there were certain things that I wanted it to be able to do...and for those i found I really didn't want to pay the price.

just before last Christmas my son went out and spent over $1,200.00 on a digital camera. It's a beauty and does a little bit of everything that any camera should...but $1,200 +, that's a little much when I only want to be able to send pictures over the computer.

Our local Wal-Greens had a sale a few weeks back on their Polaroid Digitals. So I ran down the hill and bought one for $60.00. On the second day I returned it...and came home with a different brand that cost $120...returned that one on the same day. The problem with the first two were that the pictures they sent were distorted, and not at all clear.

While on a trip to Nevada to visit my brother, he took me to a camera store. here the sold everything;$35.00 to $3,500.00! They had one of these <b>Polaroid FotoMax PDC-640</b>. I figured &quot;what the hay&quot; and bought it...and now you know why I haven't been writing more of my &quot;Baja Reviews&quot;.

I have been playing!! This camera is wonderful!!

<b>A few it's good points are;</b>

1. It is very affordable.
2. the quality IS Polaroid!
3. All you do is point and shoot!
5. it has auto focus!
6. Best of all the pictures are as crisp &amp; clear as the ones from my son's $1,200 number!.

<b>And now a few of it's built in qualities;</b>

1. A 1.8&quot; LCD Monitor/ viewer.
2. Built in flash....which has 4 modes; auto, fill-in, red-eye, and off.
3. Built in timer....so the picture taker can get into the shot also.
4. Removable memory card.
5. Serial cable for transferring pictures from the camera to the computer.
6. Video cable for viewing pictures on the TV.
7. Storage capacity for up to 96 images.
....12 images = super fine clarity.
....24 images = high resolution 
....36 images = standard resolution.

<b>And another really fun feature;</b>

The Polaroid PDC640 comes with a &quot;&quot;CREATIVE KIT&quot;. This kit offers all that is needed to put your face on the body of a miner or a baby. Some really funny photos can come together with this feature. My grandson love's how I look as a 3 month old baby...mustache and all!

I would recommend this Digital Camera to anyone who doesn't want to ...or can't afford to...spend a small fortune on a digital camera, but still want a good quality camera. Three cheers for Polaroid!!
