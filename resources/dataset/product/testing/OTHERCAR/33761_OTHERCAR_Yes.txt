            Seats:
The SE model has leather seats which are pretty nice.  I'm about 5'7" with an average build and I find the seats very comfy, even for extended road trips (11 hrs a day).  Infinitely better than the '92-'94 Sable/Taurus where I'd start getting sore after 2 or 3 hours.  There is ample room in the back, and I noticed that most ppl seem to fall asleep instantaneously back there on road trips.  For headroom, it's fine for me, but people who are tall (6'3"ish) like to have the moonroof open so they can sit up straight.

Cargo Space:
The trunk is a decent size and the rear seat folds down for longer cargo.  However, the seat doesn't fold down as cleanly as I'd like so I'm a bit ansy about putting anything really heavy on top of the folded seat.  The opening between the two areas is fairly wide (3.5-4 feet?) but narrower than the rest of the trunk.  The doors on the coupe are also pretty wide, which makes getting some things into the car  bit easier.

Power:
The car has decent power...  considering it's a 4-cylinder engine and it's not a sports car.  It accelerates well enough in most situations, but lacks power when climbing some hills.  Popping it into 3rd gear generally solves that problem (by using D3 on the automatic).  The car also lacks adequate acceleration and braking when the car is fully loaded.  This happened when I was moving things to school and also when I had 7 people in the car.

Handling:
This is the best part about the car. Unlike other versions of the Accord, the 3rd gen Accords have a sports suspensions.  Not only does this let me fly around most curves at 1.5x the posted speed, but it's also nice to have when in case of emergencies.  At 60mph, this car can make an instant 45 degree turn (tires squeal a bit), something I had to do to avoid a car pulling out into my lane from a complete stop without thinking.  The only downside to this is that you'd never want to go back to a car without this feature.

Sound System:
The SE model features a Bose system with amp.  Decent sound, but no CD player.  Uses a retractable antennae that goes up even when playing tapes.  Needs some tweaking, but this is the best sound system I own.

Maintenance:
I've had this car a year and haven't had to do much work on it.  Mainly filters and such.  The oil filters cost about $4 each.  The air filters about $14?  The car does get squeaky when it's cold, but generally dead quiet when warm.  The car does idle a bit rough, but that's because I need to get a new oxygen sensor or something (it's about time...  the car is 9 years old).

Gas Mileage:
In Pittsburgh (lots of stops and lots of hills) I get around 18mpg.  In Cleveland I get a lot better...  I think 22mpg.  On the highway, I get about 28mpg.

Interior:
The interior is very well done and everything is easy to find.  I kind of wish there were radio controls by the steering wheel, but the dials and buttons on the radio are large enough to permit me to almost blindly reach down (way down).  There is a coin tray to the left of the steering wheel that is good for coins (surprise) and also parking cards.  The gauges (tach, speed, gas, temp) are easy to see and there is a gas light (unlike some cars).  The horn uses two buttons on the steering wheel.  Not as nice as hitting the center of the wheel, but at 1 inch square, they're sorta large enough.  The defroster and hazard lights are at the top of the center panel with the heating control underneath.  The heating system works using two dials for temp and fan speed with buttons for which vents to use.  The heat starts working after 5 minutes in the cold.  My AC is weak, but it starts working after about half a minute.  The cup holder sucks.  It's an inch off the bottom of the center console and the holes are about the size of a soda can.  There are some areas for you to put stuff on the dash, but it's not too useful since most things slide around while driving.  There are pockets on the back of the seats, on the doors, and there are also two compartments in the rear seat.
