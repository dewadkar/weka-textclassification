            This is my 4th digital camera. I bought it primarily because of the large telephoto zoom lens and because of the large array of manual features. The Olympus name helped too...

Let me start by saying that this is not the best point and shoot camera. This is a camera for people who enjoy manual control over their photos. I shoot a lot of sports and the ability to control shutter speed, aperture, exposure and a large telephoto lens is very important. In addition this camera feels right. It is large enough to allow for a proper grip and not heavy enough to be uncomfortable.

I would seriously recommend this for people who like to experiment and use manual settings or for people who like large telephoto capabilities. Not for people who are looking for a portable camera. 

I also bought an SR Electronics slave flash that I use for indoor shots and the indoor shots became absolutely spectacular.

I recommend you get an extra set of rechargeable batteries and some more digital film and you will be all set. You can shoot many photos with this camera before you have to worry about replacing the rechargeable batteries.

And now for the pros and cons.

<B>PROS:</B>

Large telephoto zoom lens,
Great quality photos,
Great array of settings and manual controls,
Easy interface and easy to use,
Great body,
Comfortable grip,
Looks like a regular film cam,
Does not chew up batteries too much,
Batteries and charger included.

<B>CONS:</B>

Slight purple hues at full zoom (perfect glass is very expensive so for this price I would consider this to be a minor con).
The ISO 400 setting has way too much noise. It is barely usable.
Other than that I like this camera very much.

<B>CONCLUSION:</B>

If this has the features you are looking for look no more. 
This is the camera for you.
