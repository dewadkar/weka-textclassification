            My step-dad recently purchased a brand new 2002 Toyota Camry.  We bought an top of the line XLE w/ leather with red exterior.


INTERIOR
The Camry's interior is very well laid out and comfortable.  Our leather interior seats provide great support and are comfortable for long trips.  Their is a good amount of leg and head room, although not as much as the Toyota Avalon.  The instrument panel is easy to read and organized quite nicely.  The stereo sounds good and has a in dash 6 disc CD changer which is a nice feature to have.  

EXTERIOR
Toyota continues to design the Camry with very neat, inoffensive styling.  The design certainly won't turn any heads, but it has a nice clean design, although I'm not crazy about the back end and tailights.  The XLE we purchased comes standard with 16 inch alloy wheels which make a big difference in the look of the car.  If you want more sport in your Camry, consider looking at the SE model.  It features dark headlights, a rear spolier, 5 spoke, 16 inch alloy wheels and a tuned sport supension.  Also, the dash and interior are designed to show a more sporty feel then the other models.

ENGINE/RIDE
We saved some money and went with the base 2.4, 4 cyl. engine.  The engine produces 157hp and as decent power throughout the rev range.  It also provides excellent fuel economy at 28 city and 35 highway.  If you want more power, consider the 3.0, V6 engine that puts on 192hp.  It is noticeable more powerful and smoother than the 4.  However, you will take a hit in fuel economy and it increase the cars price by $2000.  Our XLE rides very smooth, but only as average handling capalities.  The SE I talked about above handles much better, but the ride is also noticeably rougher, so you have to take a tradeoff and decide which is more important to you.  Also, you can get the SE with a manual transmisson if you are so inclined, but it can only be equiped with the 4cyl. engine.    

VALUE/PRICE
We got a great deal on our Camry, paying only a couple hundred over invoice at $23500.  Considering our car is fully loaded with exception of the V6 engine, we did pretty good.  We previously owned a 1993 Camry that had 165,000 miles on it and gave us no problems, so this car should last a good 10 years with no problems.  The Camry is routinely near the top of best selling cars in America each year.  I highly recommend it to those looking for a good, reliable sedan that will last for years without any problems.
