            I work for a website and we needed to buy a digital camera that would be suitable for capturing images around the office and around town and posting them on our site.  We went to CompUSA and came across the second cheapest camera there, the HP PhotoSmart 315 for $300.  The cheapest camera was $200, but was only 1.3 megapixels, had only a 4 MB storage card, and had a cheapish look and feel.  This camera sold with an 8 MB flash card and 2.1 megapixels.

We brought this camera back to the office and were instantly impressed.  It was very easy to set up and to start taking pictures right away.  The LCD screen is very clear and readable, but after some playing with it, we decided to converse battery life that we could use it sparingly.  We weren't disappointed with our decision, after a few weeks of moderate use the battery life still registers full.

This camera takes pictures exactly the same way as a 35 MM camera.  Just point and shoot.  When you are finished, you have the option of previewing your photos on the LCD screen and deleting them or editing them slightly.  It can hold 10 highest quality photos, 20 medium quality, 80 low quality, or a combination of the three.  We found that medium quality was much higher than we needed for our site, but since we regularly transfer pictures to our desktops, the 20 pictures we can store are more than enough.  Even at the lowest quality, picture quality is good.

The digital zoom quality, however, wasn't nearly as good, but this is to be expected.  We shy away from digital zoom, and just get closer to the subject if we need to.

I went to HP's store and was disappointed to find that the cost of accessories was very expensive.  For instance, an AC adapter, which would be very useful since we take most of the pictures indoors, is $60 and rechargable batteries are about that price as well.  I believe flash cards from other manufacturers are compatible, which is good because they too were very expensive at HP's store.

We are very pleased with this purchase, and will enjoy the use of this camera for years to come.  Even though I have really no use for this camera for personal use, I even considered buying one for myself because its just so darn cool.  No developing or film charges with a digital camera!
