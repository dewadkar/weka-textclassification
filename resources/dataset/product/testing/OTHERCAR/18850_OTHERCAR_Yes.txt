            I have recently turned the great age of 18, and I still have my very first car, a 1995 Monte Carlo Z34.  When I first got the car I wasn't disappointed with it, even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted.  It had a very sporty type look to it, and I could see my self driving it which was a big plus.  
During my first drive in it, I noticed it had good acceleration and had a very nice ride; it also handled very well.  The radio sounded great, but now I have modified it slightly.  There are many great things about this car, and it does make you feel proud while passing someone.  
I love the comfort, especially on long trips.  When I first got the car, it had 85,000 miles on it; now it has just over 120,000 and still going strong. 
The only major maintenance I have had to do is change the transmission fluid, new drive Belt, and replace the oxygen and coolant sensors.  The one thing that is particularly odd about the car is that it is extremely difficult to work on, due to the engineering and position of the engine. It seems that everything, no matter how minor, you have to change or replace it takes numerous steps to get to it. 
Despite its flaws, the car is an all around winner in my book.<br><br>
