            We decided to venture into the digital camera arena this Christmas.  I didn't know much about digital cameras but I knew I liked the versatility that comes with taking pictures digitally...  Here are the details:

Pictures:
The pictures that I have downloaded and printed on my printer have been excellent quality.  I even printed an 8X10 of my daughter and it turned out great.  The images were not grainy as I had suspected they would be.  I have read a lot of reviews that state the casual photographer should not need much more than a 2.0 mega-pixel camera.  After printing pictures and having some printed by online retailers, I must say I am NOT disappointed.  The colors seem true to life and I haven't seen much red-eye.

Features:
The ability to delete unwanted pictures and have printed only the pictures you like is a digital camera's main selling point.  All digital cameras basically allow this.
There is a screen-based menu that allows you to save pictures, mark them as your "favorite", erase the pictures on the camera, and adjust the picture settings.  I haven't had problems adjusting anything yet. 
 
The navigational tool is a concave button and you push the top, bottom, left or right of the circle to choose the menu item you want.  You also review your pictures with this button.

The delete button is set off to the top of the camera so there is not much chance you will accidentally erase all of your pictures.  The menu will ask you specifically if you want to delete as well so there should be no mistaking what you are doing.

There is also a "close-up" switch on the side of the camera to be used for taking pictures less than 12 inches from the subject.  Using this features seems to make a marked difference.

When taking the picture you can choose to view the subject through a standard view finder or through the video screen. I have noticed that the battery drains more quickly if you use the digital screen.  Also it is also harder to control whether your subject is centered in the frame using the screen.

This camera has a 2X zoom.  This means that when you are looking at the digital screen you can press to the right on the navigational button and it will zoom once to a set position. That's it.  If I could change anything it would be this.  Although I still enjoy the camera I would like to have a better zoom function.

Miscellaneous:
You can use AA batteries, but after having the camera for three weeks we had gone through 4 sets of AA batteries.  Albeit it was Christmas time and I took lots of pictures.  We got the dock that comes separate from the camera as a Christmas gift and all you need to do is set the camera in the dock and it recharges.  While it is in the dock you also only have to press a button on the dock to download the pictures into your computer.  I would say this accessory ($75) is a must-have since you will probably spend at least that much in batteries during the first year of ownership.

Durability:
It seems like a sturdy little camera.  I think the body is plastic.  It has been dropped on the kitchen floor once without any change in the way it operates.  So far so good!!!
