            I definitely consider myself a "car person" and always pay close attention to what people are driving. I can look at a car on the road and name the make and model. I go to car shows with my boyfriend and pore over the car literature endlessly upon returning. 

I rented a Dodge Neon for two weeks in May. Driving this car for this two weeks got me thinking (temporarily) that I needed to have a lower car payment and spend less money on gas each week. I even went and looked at the Neon on two car dealer lots and test drove one. If I hadn't gotten used to and weren't so comfortable in a mid-size car, I might have seriously considered this car.

<b>My Driving Experience With This Car:</b>

I was in a more-than-slight fender bender in May of this year. My car at the time (an Oldsmobile Intrigue) needed $2,000 of work done and needed to be in the repair shop for about two weeks.  I was then told by my insurance company that I could rent only a compact car while my Intrigue was being fixed. I was not looking forward to being in what I thought was going to be a tiny little bug of a car!

I picked up the silver, 4-door, Neon SXT on a rainy weekday morning. I had to drive approximately 20 miles to work in the car and was not looking forward to it. 

Upon getting into the car, I immediately noticed how roomy the interior was for a small car. (I once owned a Pontiac Sunbird, which was plagued by an annoying dashboard that came WAY out into the cabin of the car, particularly in the middle.) The Neon had a flat, compact dash and gave me plenty of arm room. 

The seats in the Neon were not power-operated, but were comfortable, and moved back and forth and up and down easily. I'm not a tiny person, so I appreciated the wider bucket seats as compared to other small cars.

On the way to work (of course I was running late), I found myself driving rather fast in the rain, and then realized that I shouldn't trust this car automatically..I needed to see how it handled in the rain. I had already driven over 10 miles in the rain, at about 10 miles over the speed limit with no problems at all. I slowed down but did pay attention to how the Neon handled in the rain - smoothly and with no slippage at all. The ride was smooth, and the car seemed to "take" bumps in the road very well for a smaller car.

I noticed when I was at stop signs and stoplights that the car did not idle smoothly. It seemed to have a "roughness" to it and a few times I got the impression that it would stall in a split second if I gave it the opportunity. 

This car is easy to pull into a parking spot because it is so small. I had forgotten how nice this was. I have had larger cars for about 5 years now and always seem to be pulling into a parking spot and then straightening the car out. With the Neon, I pulled right in and there was no need for straightening.


<b>Other Things I Noticed:</b>

The body and doors on this car seemed solid. The paint job was smooth, glossy and appeared to be very high quality. 
I felt fairly safe in this car, considering the fact that it is a small car. Airbags helped to make me feel more comfortable, of course! The windshield seemed large for a small car and was easy to see out of. The steering was solid and the steering wheel was easy to grip and maneuver. 

Braking was no problem in the Neon. I felt as though I could "stop on a dime" in this car. 

Last, but definitely NOT least, gas mileage in this car was fantastic. I found myself getting 28 miles per gallon. For me, this meant that the entire time I had the car, I filled the tank completely once and spent just $10, and then put just $5 in again...in two weeks! This is half of what my Impala costs me in two weeks! 


<b>So Why Didn't I Buy A Neon?</b>

I didn't buy a Neon after visiting two lots and test driving one because I am one of those people who would LIKE to save money by buying a smaller, less expensive car, but then would get mad at themselves and actually feel cheated for not buying a more luxurious car. I feel that a car is an expression of myself. I finally decided on a Chevrolet Impala, to the tune of $10,000 more than a Neon. Yes, sometimes I feel as though I made a bad decision financially!

In the future, if I am in the market for an inexpensive, 4-door car, I will most definitely consider the Neon. I was impressed with its handling, interior size and overall style during the two week period that I drove it. I would feel comfortable putting one or two children in the back seat of a Neon with no problem and with very little concern.
