            I needed a "practical" car.  4 doors.  Good trunk.  Good mileage.  Safety.  So I searched the internet for my options.  Camry...Accord...626..Taurus.   All of these are good cars, but yet they lack something; fun.  My last car was a lightly modified 1993 Honda Civic Coupe, which was very fun to drive.  So I came across the Jetta.  Looks good.  New 1.8t engine option.  Looking better.  Woflsburg package.  What????

The Wolfsburg package contains the following:
1.8t engine
5 Speed Manual
European GTI seats
Leather Wrapped 3 spoke steering wheel
Leather Wrapped Parking Brake Handle
16" BBS Wheels w/ 205/55/16 Goodyear tires
Special Badging
Sport Suspension

This package appealed to my fun factor.  So I test drove it.  Very impressed.  Also quite impressive is the value.  Packaged only $200 more than a standard 1.8t GLS, if sport is your thing, this car is your ticket.  A slightly firmer ride (yet better than the GLX with sport package & 17" wheels), with the responsive 150-hp engine really gave this car a little edge.  Practical features such as great trunk, split fold down seats, and 30mpg+ add to the enjoyment.  I added the 6 disc trunk mounted CD changer($500), Monsoon($395), and the power sunroof($915), and total this car came out just shy of $22,000.  Not a bad deal.

Some bad items include:
Only a 5 speed is available (bad on the Wife factor)
Limited color choice (black, red, white, blue)
No Standard CD
Blue interior lights hard to see at dawn/dusk
Back seat is slightly smaller than others in its class.
Only a 2yr/24000mi bumper to bumper warranty.

One small recent gripe.  I have only had the car 5 weeks, and only 1800 miles.  I have a problem with the EPC (Electronic Power Control) and check engine light.  The dealer service department cannot seem to fix the problem, and the car remains in "limp mode".  Supposedly a Factory Technician is coming to my dealer to try to resolve the issue.  This is going to take at least a week to fix.  I am not very encouraged about this car's reliability, but I am willing to give this the benefit of the doubt, and keep my hopes up.
