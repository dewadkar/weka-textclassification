            With the Canon Power Shot A50 you can do a day trip with out having to carry extra film, it is small and compact, very durable, and it also has built in zoom. Great for those on the go. It takes great pictures with out having to carry all the equipment, but if you are one who has to have the equipment the Power Shot A50 does have a lot of options for all of your needs. One of those extras is the rechargeable battery pack because the camera does use a lot of juice if you are using the digital screen. 

The camera does come with very good software. It also comes with adobe photo shop deluxe edition, which allows you to manipulate the pictures in any way you want or need (you can even make yourself slimmer).

The way I use the camera is for business purposes and I take good enough pictures that I can transfer the pictures onto T-Shirts or other fabric and not loose a lot of quality.

So in closing I would say go for the camera it takes great pictures and has great software and enhancements but I do have to say the batteries need improving.
