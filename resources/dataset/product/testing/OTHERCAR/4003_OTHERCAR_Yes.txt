            WHAT A CAR.... Need i say more?!?! This is the BEST car I have ever owned. It drives smooth, its quite, its fast! 

I had shopped for a lot of cars, (wanting to get rid of my NIGHTMARE CAR Kia) I think I test drove everything in that class out there. There was not one car on the road today (in this class) that could beat this car. From the moment I saw it I knew this would be the one. And the people at Saturn were WONDERFUL! Never in my life have I encountered a buying experience like that. I was comfortable and taken care of 100%.

When you first sit in the car you notice how the seats feel. And let me tell you, they are NICE. The drivers area is very driver friendly. Its like the people at Saturn sat and thought about even the little things. Your doors are plush, so when the sun is beating down on them and go to rest your arm you are not burned by hot plastic or leather. The seat can move forward, and back and also up and down. So if your short like me you can raise the seat. And the back seat is very roomy. A 6ft. person could have enough room back there. The standard CD player is awesome and it also comes with a kicking 8 speaker system. 

They even thought of your drinks, you are able to have it hold a 20oz. soda or if any of you know when you get a super size drink fat chance of putting it in your drink holder right, not with this car, it can hold 2!!

I have yet to this day found anything wrong with this car! I dont think I will ever own another car. Now I understand what they mean when they say once you own a Saturn you'll never own anything else. How true how true!<br><br>
