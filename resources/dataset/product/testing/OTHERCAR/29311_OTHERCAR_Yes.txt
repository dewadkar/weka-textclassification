            This is actually about an '88 Blazer K-Model (Yeah, the behemoth with the 350 engine) but since very little changed on it and it looks like the one in the picture I hope I can squeeze it into this category and the master computer at epinion HQ doesn't kick it out.

I DID buy this Blazer in 1990 though, so to me, anyway, it is a "'90". When I bought it it had 48,000 miles on it. Now (Jan., 2001) it has some 250,000 miles on it so I've put roughly (that is in both meanings of the term) 20K miles a years on it. Shortly after I bought it a guy I knew remarked, "Ed, I think it's great. You're a 'Blazer' kind of guy." I'm not sure what that means, but I have enjoyed the Blazer a lot.

Drawbacks: Its 350 c.i. engine with a four-wheel-drive drinks gas like you need to own a gasoline refinery. Especially after 250,000 miles. It gets an average of a wonderful 12 miles per gallon these days. So I don't drive it as much as I used to. And it's a little noisy inside as a truck will be after ten years. The Alpine cassette sound system in it isn't as good as it used to be because of the wind noise through the passenger compartment. It's on its third transmission, which now cost about $2,000 a pop. The big ol' knobby tires are like $100 apiece. Insurance on it runs high. It loves to go see the friendly mechanic. So it does have a few flaws.

The Pluses: On the other side of the ledger, simply stated, it is indispensible to me. 360 days out of the year it is an expensive piece of Detroit-Iron to run, but on those other MAGICAL 5 DAYS it is absolutely irreplacable. What are those other 5 days? (A) 2 days spent going up and down an ice-covered mountain road to go skiing. At least 2 days in skiing season the roads are going to be treacherous, and while 90% of all the other vehicles would find it difficult if not impossible to negotiate the glassy-slick roads, the Blazer handles them just fine, thank you, with a little judicious driving in 4WD. (B) At least 2 days in mountain climbing country in Colorado in the summer. Last summer I was on one of the roughest and most vexacious 4WD roads in continental America, which is the 4-mile-long road from near Westcliffe, Colorado to the South Colony Lakes  below the Crestone Peaks, to go mountain climbing. There were ruts 2 to 3 feet deep and boulders as big as bulls in the road. The Blazer bounced and tipped and groaned as we sloooowwwlllyyy made our way up the road (I use that term "road" only charitably because it was actually more like a dry stream-bed laden with pitfalls and gendarmes), but we did MAKE it, which, again, 90% of all other passenger vehicles in America would find a daunting if not impossible thing to do. So summer 4-wheeling and mountain-climbing make it a vehicle of not just choice but necessity. (C) Sometimes a monstrous, killer storm will sweep down on your area and the roads will become rain-swollen or wind-driven or iced-or-snowed over. It is then that a vehicle like the Blazer shines. We had a winter's day like that this year, and when we needed some groceries we could make it while it would have been problematic in our other vehicles. So again, the old invincible Blazer showed its (true) colors.

Most people don't live the more extreme lifestyle I've chosen. Oh, I'm not a gonzo, Rambo-type or anything like that, but I do need a vehicle that can do what others can't at times. So for that I'll pay the added bucks and keep the "Old" '88 Blazer in good running order. It's saved my bacon a few times. No reason why I shouldn't return the favor.
