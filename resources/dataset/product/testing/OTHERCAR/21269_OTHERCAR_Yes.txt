            O.K. - So it is my first new car.  I was driving a 1990 Ford Tempo, so to tell you the truth any new car would be an improvement.  Heck, a unicycle would have probably got me around better than my Tempo.  The fact is though, that I have been in several new cars the past year and as far as the drive - the Camry takes the Cake!!

The Camry CE (4-cyl) I bought is Black with the Gold Package.  I absolutely LOVE this car.  It is everything I had hoped it would be and more.  I bought it in November of '99 and today put my 5000th mile on it.  It has a CD player, auto windows, and cruise.  The sound system is EXCELLENT.  The car handles great, corners great, and for a 4-cyl it accelerates wonderfully.  The truck is HUGE - the seats fold down part way for more access.    

I have learned quickly though that I will never buy a Black car again.   The car gets dirty very quickly up North where I live.   I have a ding on the door already and a scuff mark on the front from God knows what.  Both show up much more than they would on another color.  Oh well, live and learn.

Test Drive the Camry if you are looking for a new car - it will be worth your time.<br><br>
