            I own a 1999 Kia Sportage 4x4.  I bought my Sportage in September 1999 because of the excellent rebates being run at the time.

When I bought my Sportage it was $7000 less than a comparably equipped CRV or RAV-4.

I have had my Sportage for almost 2 years now, and I have had a few minor problems.  I can't say that this is the most trouble free vehicle I have owned, but I do consider it to be reliable.  It has never left me stranded.

I have used this vehicle to move to a new home, and it performed admirably for only having a 4 cyl. engine.

I also get decent gas mileage for an SUV.  I average 21 mpg, and have seen 24 mpg with steady highway driving.

To those who have complaints about their Sportages, let me say that the dealership makes all the difference in the world!  A GOOD dealership will fix your vehicle right the first time, and they will go to bat for you to get the car fixed right.  Remember to shop the dealer for service, as all Sportages are the same.
