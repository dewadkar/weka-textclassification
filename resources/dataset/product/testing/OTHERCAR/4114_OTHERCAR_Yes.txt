            Bought the SUV brand new in 1998.  I needed a SUV for lugging around computer junk and golf clubs.  Test drove the Toyota 4Runner and the Toyota rav4.  The Pathfinder rode a lot nicer than the 4 Runner which handled and felt much like a truck, and the Rav4 just did not have any power behind it.  After two years, I still am very happy with this vehicle.  I'll tell you a little story which will both prove that I'm an idiot and that the Nissan is truly a durable vehicle.  I stopped in to have an oil change at some lube shop and the mechanics did'nt tighten the oil pan screw in well enough.  Well, needless to say, all the oil ran out of the engine, and even though the engine started sounding like a diesel truck, I continued to drive it for at least 5 more miles to the nearest gas station.  Any other engine, and I'm sure I would have blown the engine, but not here.  I bought a new oil cap, added oil, the pistons lubed up one by one, and I have not had a single problem since.  I even had it checked out, and nothing wrong.  Hope this never happens to you, but just food for thought.  Very happy with my Pathfinder.<br><br>
