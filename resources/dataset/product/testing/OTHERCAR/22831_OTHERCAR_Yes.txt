             The 2003 Lincoln Navigator, my mother recently bought one at a local lincoln dealership. When I first saw it I felt in love with it, but when I drove it I was just attach. It is the most exquisite vehicle in the world. So much space and quietness. Some of my favorite touches of the Navigator are the following.

  1) The avaible Navigation System, using a satellite base Global Positioning System, is conveniently situated for easy reach and viewing.
  2)The avaible Rear Seat Entertainment Sytem with DVD which also includes a ceiling mounted 7-inch LCD screen for watching videos, and it comes with ports to connect the video games. (Now I can play Gran Turismo while driving)

  3) The power running boards that deploy when you oplen the door and retract when you closed it. 
  4) The poweer adjustable Brake and accelerator pedals that can travel up to three inches to assume the most comfortable driving positions. 

  5)The power folding third row seats, which conviniently fold flat into the floor. This S.U.V was designed with trips to the supermarket in mind. I mean, the power gate opens while you hold the cart and then if you have to many bags just press a buttom and voila there is more space with out having to do anything.
  6) Now tis option is the one that make me want to run to the dealer and buy one for myself, I live in Texas so you would understand. The avaible climate-controlled driver and passenger seats. It allows both of them to regulate the temperature of their seats, sendig either cool or heated up air up through the seat cushions for additional comfort. Imagine the hot leather during the summer, with this no more leather burns.

  7)The avaible Extended Rear Park Assist. Ussing both radar and ultrasonic, an audible warning signal increases in intensity as certan objects are within 20 feet or the rear of the vehicle.

  8) Something new for the 2003 model year is the addition of the IRS and no this is not the one that wants your money. Independent Rear Suspension is what it stands for. It uses both Upper and Lower Control Arms with 4-corner load-leveling air springs over monotube dampers. It allows every wheel to reat to road conditions with minimal effects. This S.U.V. rides like a cadillac or even a town car yet it has better handling that in previous years.
  
 Now I know that from what you have read previously you would jump to your car and get one. That is ok, I stronly recommend it, but there is some things you may not like. 

  1) It carries over the 5.9 liter engine from the previous model. 

        DOHC 32 valve  InTech V8 
        5.4 liter/330 cu. in
        300hp@5000 rpm
        355lp-ft@2750rpm
        91 octane unleaded (minimum)
  2)The IRS suspension could be a little bit more firms, body roll is noticible while cornering. With the rar seat in the up right position the cargo volume is only 17.9 cubic feet.


   Safety and Crash Avoidance Features are:

    1) Advance Trac or Vehicle Stability Enhancement System.
    2) Antilock Braking System
    3) Electronic Brake Distribution
    4) Brake Assist
    5)Traction Control System
    6) Control Trac 4WD SystemHigh 
    7) High Intensity Discharge Headlamps. 
    8) Reverse Tilt Down rear view mirrors
    9) THe standard Rollover capable side impact airbag     
       curtains.
    10) Four wheel ventiladed disc brakes. 
    11 ) Tire pressure monitoring system. 

This is truly a very capable S.U.V with lots of luxury and well just about anything you can ask for an some more. It could use a little bit more power, since the caddilac Escalade uses a 6.0 Liter 345hp V8 engine and a is going to offer and Extended version for the 2003 year, lincoln should be thinking about getting and extended model for the next year.
