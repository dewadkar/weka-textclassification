            We've had our 2001 Nissan Maxima SE since late December '00, and we love it.  Its only competitor for us was the Audi A4 Quattro.  It's was the same price in the end, but the trunk was just too tiny (if we put our double stroller in it, that was all she wrote).

A TREMENDOUS improvement (albeit simple) for the '01 models was to change the rear lense covers to a smoked color.  The '00 have RED rear tailight covers, and to me it was horrendous looking.  In fact, if I had a '00, the first thing I'd do is run out and order a '01 pair of rear lense covers.

The gas mileage has been the only downside, however I must admit I'm sure I'm paying more attention to it now with these high prices.  We are extremely conservative drivers, and our car is an automatic.  The BEST mileage we have ever gotten was 24.  That was premium gas, solid highway, cruise control, no crazy accelerations, downhill (ha), no a/c....  in fact, it barely got over the 20 MPG mark until just in the last month (we now have 9,000 miles on the car).

The only other not-so-great thing is the Bose sound system.  The rear speakers are mounted on the doors instead of the back platform.  The subwoofer is mounted in the middle of the back platform.  To me, the sound is inferior that way.  If you are trying to hold a conversation with the people in the front seats, its nearly impossible without the radio turned completely down, as the speakers are between you and the front people.

One thing I recommend getting IMMEDIATELY is a custom-made rubber mat for the trunk with a 2 inch lip on the edges for any spills (jcwhitney.com has these for $100).  This makes for no smells, easy cleanups, etc.

We have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far.  This is my 3rd Maxima, and the best.
