            Bought new in 1995 a limited with a v-8 engine.My wife loves the car because it sits up high and makes for better visibility. She also says that it is easy to park.Those are the good points. The bad points are when we were close to 50K miles first the air cond. compressor went bad then at about 5000 miles more the transmission went out.Thank goodness we had bought an extended warranty just before these problems occured and it only cost $50.00 for each problem.I would suggest that anyone that buys one,get an extended warranty.
  Would we buy another one? yes. The exterior looks as good as new as does the interior and it is comfortable to drive.<br><br>
