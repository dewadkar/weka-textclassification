            I am on my 3rd Villager.  I had a 1993 Villager GS, 1997 Villager GS, and now a 1999 Estate. The 2nd door is a wonderful addition.  It handles easily, all controls easy to see and work with. I love the in cab 6 CD player, the shelf in the back with netting to keep packages in place, and the improved cupholder.  This one actually holds cups larger than a standard pop can, unlike previous years.  I especially appreciate the extra length for storage (about 4-6" from previous years)

The Driver's side floor mat is not anchored as well as previous years, and I eventually had to get rid of it, as it kept bunching up in the brake/accelerator area.  I replaced it with a heavy duty rubber mat, and that is okay.

The seat belt size is very generous.  I have a co-worker who used to be very very heavy.  She was able to use my Villager seatbelt as is.  Yet my husband must use an extender on his mom's Cadillac.  The villager definitely wins in this category too!

My Villagers have to do double duty:  Reasonably good mileage for my long commute, but plenty of room to haul my dogs to dog shows and earthdog trials.  The removable 2nd row seat ( in my case 2 captains chairs) and the sliding 3rd seat are great.  When we get to a destination and unpack, we can set up the third seat and go out to dinner with friends all in one vehicle.

I love the Villager and it just gets better every year!
