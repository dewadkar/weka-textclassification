            We bought our 95 Nissan Altima in 1997. It had 38,000 miles on it at the time and was a good bargain at the local used car dealer. We were looking to trade in a very troublesome GMC Jimmy, and we wanted a passenger car that had more room than our Honda Civic Hatchback. Now the car has 112,000 miles on it and has been an incredibly reliable machine. We have two small children (both new arrivals since the purchase of the car), and for families of our size it is a perfect vehicle. Recently we have had to replace the alternator and the mid-pipe on the muffler. These are the ONLY major repairs we have had to pay for in the last 70,000 miles. The car handles nicely in all sorts of weather (we live in the Northeast, although we bought the car while living in Wisconsin). It has many nice features, such as power locks and windows, passenger and driver side airbags, etc. Great car!<br><br>
