            When I graduated college and slid into a 'real' job, I decided I wanted a 'real' sports car.  In my searching, I couldn't believe the number of clean 300Z Twin Turbos that were on the market.  I ended up getting a pristine (albeit high mileage) model with all options for little more than half it's original mid $40k sticker, which was neatly folded in the glovebox, by the way.

My 1994 black on black 5 speed twin turbo represented a wonderful used sports car purchase, in my eyes.  The car handles very tightly (especially with the sport suspension setting on the cockpit adjustable shocks), the power is there when you need it with almost no turbo lag, the looks are second to none, and you also get a measure of exclusiveness you wouldn't normally find in other sports cars.

If you are into performing subtle changes to make your sports car go faster than stock, this is the car for you!  With some VERY simple modifications, this car raises to performance levels that match Viper R/T's, ZR1's, and supercharged muscle cars.

I performed 3 upgrades to my car a few weeks after its purchase:

1)  New intake system with K&amp;N filter
2)  New exhaust, freer flow
3)  Newly reprogrammed computer and more boost through modifying the wastegate setup

This 'package' was about $1500, plus $200 installation fee.  The newly found horses total 396 (96 more than stock!) according to the www.jimwolftechnology.com website and I proved that at the 1/4 mile drag strip by running 12.9 @ 110 mph with no other modifications!

With all of the used Z's around going for $10k to $25k, you are bound to find one that fits your budget and other requirements.  The feeling you get from driving a Twin Turbo Z is great - take the t tops off, spool the turbos up and ENJOY THE RIDE!!!<br><br>
