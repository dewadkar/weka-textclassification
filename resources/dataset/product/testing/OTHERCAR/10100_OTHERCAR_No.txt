            We owned a 96' Mercury Sable and let me tell you, it was built Ford Tough, baby.

We bought this car from Budget Rental Car, I guess they knew what this car was made of.  About a month or so after we bought this car, we started to notice that the tires were getting worn out quickly.  So, we bought new tires and that was the end of it, so we thought.  About two months later, those new 40,000 mile tires were already worn out, ummmmm?

We took it to a Sears and had the car checked out.  Guess what, our good friends at Ford forgot to drill the strut holes and that made the tires ware out quick.  Now, that is just not a simple mistake, that is a major problem.  So after we had that fixed we thought that we had a good ol' car that was built &quot;Ford Tough&quot;, yeah right, or pieces of junk cars is &quot;Ford Tough&quot;.  

The next problem that we had with this car was that we noticed that the temperature gauge was reading really high just in normal driving conditions.  We thought the the thermostat went out, so we had that changed.  That did not change anything, it still kept reading that the engine was overheating.  So, we went to the Ford dealer to have the radiator checked out and we found out that the radiator was recalled and Ford Motor Company did not send us a letter saying that the radiator was recalled.  Isn't that nice of them?  

Then we had this &quot;kit&quot; that the Ford dealer put in to stop the over heating problem.  Did that work? Nope.  Those good ol' guys at Ford put in the wrong kit, they put the kit in for a 97' car and ours was a 96'.  

We finally got that problem straightened out and we were off again in the troubles world.  The next thing to go, yep, the transmission.  We finally decided to heck with this car, we don't need this piece of Ford.  So, we traded it in on another Ford, thinking that our old one was just a lemon, nope, our new 99' Ford Contour is another &quot;Ford Tough&quot; car.

So, what I suggest is to stay away from those Fords.  Buy a GM or a foreign car.<br><br>
