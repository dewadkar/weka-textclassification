            I've got a &quot;Super Black&quot; one of these babies with all the options that they had a the time I got it.
The reason I can say this is because I got one of the 1st generation Nissan Frontier 4x4s before some of the options like the roof rack, and the tailgate extender had even been invented.
I bought my 2000 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab 4x4 SE with V6 and all the options in early June of 1999.
I did have a 1997 Red Cavalier Z24 with all the options, but my drivers license almost got revoked because I drove like an Indy car star.
I would powerbrake around corners and race every other sporty car on the road.  Well, it got me in trouble and I had to find something different.
I decided if I couldn't go fast, I would go hard.  I have taken my 4x4 off road several times and it handles like a charm in 4wd.  I did very well in the snow and ice this winter and I even got in some deep stuff that it got me out of.

By the way - I had to rip out all the crappy stereo equipment that came with it (even though I got the best they had) and install JL Audio 6 1/2&quot; components up front with 1&quot; tweeters and 6 1/2&quot; Eclipse mid-basses in the back with a Pioneer DH-7000 head unit and remote control.
Don't even think about taking it - my car is protected by Colt, Ruger, and Taurus - Handheld security systems.

Thanks
