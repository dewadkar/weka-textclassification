            For the last few years I've had a decent amount of feedback from Maxima owning friends, and it's been nothing but positive.  I've driven them, and loved the ride.
My girlfriend had wanted one as well, so when it was time for us to buy a couple new (semi-new) cars for the both of us to share, the Maxima was a must-have.

And it's been nothing but a joy to own since day one.
True to my past experiences, the ride and build of the car is superb.

No point in mentioning the looks.  IMO it's one of the nicest looking cars on the road, and got the smoky metalic gray color, you know the rest.

We bought the SE model, used with very low mileage.  It's got very nice power for its class.  Surprising acceleration, good breaking, and superb turning with little to no  body roll around corners.  Gas mileage is good considering its power.  Very low engine noise, all but inaudible at an idle or low RPM's.  Wind noise is low.

I have no reason to doubt this car's reliability;  my current experience and track record of the Maxima make me feel like the only things we'll have to put into this car are oil, air filters, and gas.  For a very long time.  Our other car (a Pontiac Grand Am GT) has already needed servicing on two occasions, and the two were purchased the same time, with the Grand Am being the far lower mileage car of the two (less than half)

The interior's more fun.  There's a sense of vastness in the mid-sized car, thanks to the slope of the dashboard and width of the car.
The Bose sound system's very nice.  Not mind-blowing, but a step up from standard fare.  The cassette and CD combo's very useful.  The heated seats may very well be my girlfriend's single favorite feature, and they do the job well.  The AC is not the strongest, but it'll drop your car to an acceptable 65 degrees, and keep it there without freezing you out or forcing you to change settings to maintain a comfort level.  The seats are firm yet comfortable.  Add the sunroof and you've got a car that's simply fun to be in.

As for simple owner servicing, things couldn't be more convenient.  Looking under the hood immediately gave me yet another reason to consider this a car done right on all fronts.  Translucency allows for easy gauging of common fluids, and everything's just plain neat and orderly.

The only negative thing I've witnessed regarding this car are *potentially* the seats.  The leather feels to be aging a bit, we'll have to look into some means of treating it without staining ourselves.  I won't jump the gun and declare the seats a problem, just yet.  They're just apparently harder and dryer than day one.  Not unpleasant or old looking.

Best car I've had the pleasure of owning.  It's a fun car to drive for a single person, a great family car and a superb blend of luxury, sportiness and practicality.  I'd love to see more American cars with this worksmanship and efficiency.
