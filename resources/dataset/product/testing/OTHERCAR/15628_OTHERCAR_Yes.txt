            The Sony Mavica FD91 is a great camera. The pros are that it is digital and pictures take on floppy disks, therefore needing no wires to the computer. It takes beautiful outdoor pictures in bmp or jpg form and you can also pick email format. It has a powerful Zoom lens. It can take the picture of scales on a lizard with the great macro. It also takes 60 second mpgs. The one drawback with this camera is that it does not do well in low light situations. Sometimes you can get it just right, but many times you cannot. I am going to add a slave flash to mine and that should make this a near perfect camera. If you don't mind the bulk, this is the camera for you.<br><br>
