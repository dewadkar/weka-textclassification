            I have to state first that I did not purchase this vehicle, but it was very high on the list of vehicles that I was considering. It wasn't that there was anything wrong with the Xterra, it just didn't fulfill as many of our wants and needs as another did (the Ford Explorer). 

I was quite impressed by the Xterra - certainly a lot more impressed than I thought I would be. The stadium seating in the rear was quite a novelty and made for some amazing leg-room and front view. The car salesperson who went with us was more than 6 feet tall, and he looked remarkably comfortable and stretched-out in the back. The vehicle drives quite well, although there was an interesting vibration in the lower back of the driver's seat which I felt would alternate between somewhat of a relaxing massage for a short drive and possibly an annoyance on long road-trips. The vehicle's seats weren't as cushy as compared to, say, a Ford Explorer, but for all basic SUV intents and purposes, it fares reasonably well.

The Xterra is utilitarian. There is no other word in my mind which fits it better. If you happen to be someone who is looking for a rugged, no-frills SUV, this would be it. Its price range is very reasonable. However, we were approaching our vehicle search as parents of a small child, and we were looking for some cargo space without sacrificing too much comfort, and as was mentioned, another vehicle fit our needs better so we dropped the Xterra from our list.

I didn't like the very limited choices offered on the option packages - some of the options I wanted came specifically with other things I didn't want at all, and there seemed to be no way around it. Bear in mind though, that the individuals intending the Xterra for more rugged use would probably find everything perfectly tailored to their needs!<br><br>
