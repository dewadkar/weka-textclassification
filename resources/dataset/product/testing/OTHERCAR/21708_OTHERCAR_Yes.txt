            <I> *Note: A long time ago, when I was new here, I wrote a review on this Cavalier. It wasn�t up to my new-found quality, so I decided to re-write it. It needed so much help that I just decided to re-write it all together, so here goes... </I> 


I bought my 1998 Chevy Cavalier LS new in December of 1997. It is a great looking car that was a much-needed upgrade from my (cute!) 1993 Geo Storm GSI. My car is a 4-door LS model with a 2.4L engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. Before I tell you my opinion however, here are the facts:



<b> Under The Hood </b>


The 1998 Chevy Cavalier Sedan came with either a 120 horsepower 2.2L or 150 horsepower 2.4L Engine.  Both engines are L4 type, and are fairly strong engines. The 2.4L I can vouch has a lot of zip off the line, but the 4-cylinder engine just doesn�t have enough strength to back the power up or to even handle the horsepower properly. 

You can get a couple of different transmissions:

*Automatic 3-speed
*Automatic 4-speed (which is one of those no-service for 100,000 miles transmissions)
*Manual 5-speed



<b> Interior </b>

A downfall of the 1998 Cavalier is its interior. The seat fabrics do not hold up as promised and the mass amounts of plastic parts are not only hard to clean, but rattle endlessly. The interior components include the dash, an ashtray, a cigarette lighter (which is near the ignition), sun visors, glove box, and center console, which opens for storage. The console is also where the power window controls can be found, and the cup holders (one outside and one inside the console).

There are two different dash panels you can get, one with your basic gauges and an optional cluster.
 
*Standard Cluster: fuel gauge, speedometer, temperature gauge, odometer, and warning indicators
* Optional Cluster: fuel gauge, speedometer, temperature gauge, tachometer, trip odometer, and warning indicators.  

The climate Control system is pretty easy to operate, with three knobs: fan speed, temperature, and mode. If you have air conditioning there is an additional A/C button.  The heater has ducts underneath the front seats to additionally heat the rear passengers, and the rear window defogger is quick working with a simple push of a small button.

You can get the sound system a couple of different ways:

*AM/FM Stereo, which has volume controls, time display, seek, scan, a manual tune knob, memory (to program stations), and sliding bass, treble, balance, and fade controls.

*AM/FM Stereo with Cassette, which has all the same features as the standard AM/FM Stereo, but with an added Cassette tape player. An option for this stereo is automatic tone control, which you can choose the style of music you are listening to and it adjusts the bass and treble to the �recommended� places.

*AM/FM Stereo with CD player and automatic tone control is the nicest looking system. It has all the features of the AM/FM stereo, but with added CD player and tone control. 

The trunk is disappointingly small, but the rear seat folds down to extend the trunks capacity.




<b> Safety Features </b>

The 1998 Cavalier comes standard with dual front air bags, safety belts with positioners, and height adjusters (on the 4 door models only). The 4-door models also have child safety locks on the back doors. All of the 1998 Cavaliers have daytime running lights that can only be turned off by turning the vehicle off, putting the vehicle in park, or setting the emergency brake. The Cavalier has illuminated entry and exit that fade off around 40 seconds after the doors are closed. The Caviler has antilock brakes, and you can get a traction control system as an option.

The 1998 Cavaliers ranked fairly high on front-impact crash tests, receiving 4 out of 5 stars (meaning that there is a 11-20% chance of receiving a serious injury). On side impact tests however, the front passenger safety got 1 star (a 46% or greater chance of getting a serious injury) and the rear passengers 3 stars (21-35%)



<b> Features </b>

Cavilers can be equipped with the following options:

Power door locks
Keyless entry system 
Remote trunk release (mine does not have this, and it�s horrible. I have to shut off the car and either use my key or the remote entry system to open the trunk)
Power windows (there is a lock button to prevent passengers from opening windows)
Rear spoiler (completely non-functional, but great looking)
Upgraded rims/wheels
Tilt wheel
Cruise control
Front reading lamps
Power side mirrors
Power sunroof
Traction control system
Air conditioning
Rear window defogger
Manual lumbar support
Easy Entry (on 2 door models, seat back swings forward)



<b> Economy </b> 

The 1998 Cavalier holds a little over 15 gallons of fuel. On a mixture of city and highway driving I can get anywhere between 290 to 360 miles per tank. My point being that the fuel economy changes so often that it is a bit un-reliable. I can get anywhere from 19 to 28 miles per gallon.

The Cavalier also is a fairly low maintenance car. If you get the 4-speed automatic transmission, you do not have to service or change fluids for 100,000 miles. Oil Changes are recommended every 3,000-4,000 miles, and that�s about the extent of what you need to regularly maintain.


<b> My personal Experiences </b>

My Caviler has had endless problems. With 60,000 miles, it has been in the shop at least 20 times, including once to receive a new engine. A bolt broke in my oil pump�s drive and no indicator lights lit up� needless to say the engine seized. I also have problems with the car hesitating and stalling, the transmission is jerky, and the car just rarely gives a smooth ride.  I also go through brakes and tires like you wouldn�t believe. Yes, I�ve been deemed a fast driver, but I have never gone through brakes or tires like this. 

A positive aspect is that the car handles great and is fun to drive. If you floor it from a stop, it�ll actually spin the tires ;o) but it also redlines every time you get on the freeway.  It is roomy enough to accommodate myself and my child, but small enough to be compact. 

The cargo space is big enough for groceries or my daughters large stroller, but with no room to spare, and the car seat fits well in the back seat, but no one over 5 foot 5 likes sitting back there due to the very limited leg room.

The front seats are fairly comfortable. I�m fairly tall for a woman, being 5�7� and have a good amount of legroom, but my knees still bump into the steering wheel here and there. 

The car payments are great. I have a 5-year loan, at 3.9% APR financing through GMAC. The payments are a little over $300 per month, which isn�t bad for a (bought) new, fully loaded car.

All in all, I say that if you are looking for a smaller, practical car, then the Cavalier might be an option for you. Once you get to know it and its capabilities, you will enjoy it. It�s not a 1969 Camaro, but it does the job :o)
