            I purchased my Dakota in the Spring of 2001.  I was originally shopping for a Chevy Silverado (I've always bought GM vehicles) when I ran into a wonderful deal on this Dodge Dakota.  I bought the pickup for most of the wrong reasons.  Basically, I'm a male who lives in the south and is expected to drive a pickup.  I do occasionally use it to haul things, but being in retail management doesn't usually require an exceptional degree of wear-and-tear on a vehicle.  I am also a student and found that $9500 for a used truck that looked new was an exceptional value.  Here are the main pros and cons I have for the Dakota:

I had hoped to purchase a more powerful vehicle.  Not that I exactly need one, but because I'd like one.  I figured that since I didn't need one the payoff would be much better fuel mileage.  Negative.  If you enjoy a vehicle with a lot of zip and acceleration, go find yourself a sports car.  If you're looking for pulling power and everyday durability, don't look here. Those tiny dents look really annoying against the smooth lines of the dakota.  If you need a car, but want a truck (like me), then you've found the perfect match.  

But be prepared to use the credit card for the gasoline.  I drive mostly in town and rarely see mileage greater than 15 mpg.  Even on the interstate, it only gets about 16.  The truck is in good working order, and all scheduled maintenance has been performed.

Asthetically, the dakota is very pleasing.  I love the instrument panel and the steering wheel.  The seats are very comfortable.  The only problem I is with the pull-type headlight switch and the push-on fog lamps.   The headlamp switch 'slips' as you pull it out.  Some days they come right on, other days it takes me 30 pulls to turn my lights on.  Also, the foglamp button's clips broke off and I had to epoxy the button back onto the instrument molding (better than paying for a new clip).  

Mechanically, the truck runs fairly.  When it idles, it runs somewhat smoothly.  The interior noise level is very quiet, and I'm very pleased that you cannot hear the exhaust from the interior.  On bad note--the transmission doesn't really like to go into third gear.  I have two friends who have earlier Dakotas and have already replaced their transmissions.  I haven't had this checked yet, but it slips when the transmission is cold.  Otherwise, there's plenty of room in the engine bay and everything is easy to get to.  I like working on the truck because it's easy to get to the engine and its parts without having to remove everything else that's in the way.  

Also, I live in Oklahoma and will never again buy a black vehicle.  They're impossible to keep clean.
