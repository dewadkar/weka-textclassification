            I would have to say this is the best investment we have ever made! My husband and I were nervous about buying a used vehicle. After all, all we have ever bought before were new cars. We were in need of a second vehicle so we began looking on Ebay, which was also a little scary. We came across our 1992 GMC Safari van. I loved the way it looked on the outside, and the interior looked pretty good for the year. Best of all, the price! We paid $2100 for it! It was the best ebay purchase ever, and that was two years ago. Since then, we have eliminated our new vehicle and have driven nothing but this van for about 7 months now. It gets a lot of miles on it! Currently it has over 200,000 and it drives wonderfully. We've never put any money into it really, only the repairs that are common: new brakes, wiper blades, etc. 
Our van has the 7 passenger seating, rear and front a/c, power windows, power door locks, cruise control, all the luxury features that were available with it new. There are wonderful trays in the center of all seats that can be pushed up to give more room. There are little cargo pouches everywhere. The cargo area in the back is much larger than a lot of other mini-vans. The seats can be removed and can be turned around, but are heavy. There are a great deal of windows for the children to look out. My kids love it and we have four children! It has a V6 motor that is super quiet. I believe all come with alloy wheels. It is much higher than the other mini-vans. I feel much safer in it with my children. It's very heavy. It's also good on gas. We've driven it several states away a few times, and there were no problems at all and it was good on gas. I highly recommend this van to anyone!
