            I had been wanting a VW Jetta for years, ever since I saw the new body style in 1994.  I had some specific criteria as to what I wanted to have on my car.  I bided my time and ran my trusty, rusty, Toyota Celica into the ground.  It was then time for me to go for it!  

Unfortunately I had a brief, 3 month stint with a 1994 Jetta that had been totaled, although this hadn't been told to me by the original owner.  A few months later and a few thousand in the hole I chose to lease a new one.  It was gorgeous.  A 1997, Black, VW Jetta Trek, 5 speed with a sunroof, AC, and a cool spoiler.

A few years later, the excitement has worn off and unfortunately I have not taken as good care of it as I should have.  There are a few dents and scratches that make me cringe - However!  I still enjoy my car for several reasons.

1)  It is a 4 door car, that doesn't look, feel, or drive like a 4 door car. But I really like the fact that it is 4 doors because of the convieniance for passengers.  Also for me to get in and out of my back seat for items, as I am an outside salesperson who constantly needs to carry &quot;stuff&quot; with her.

2) HUGE TRUNK!  (see above)

3) I love the way it looks, to me it is a beautiful car.  I like the body style better than the new body style.  Really, I do prefer it.

4)  Fairly reliable.

5)  Small enough to fit into compact parking spaces, but large enough for all of the things I need it to be large enough for.  Such as 3-4 passengers (4 passengers plus myself does get a little cozy), &quot;junk in the trunk&quot;, etc.

I have had a few problems with it.  I needed a new starter within the first 2 years.  The checkstraps on both rear doors needed to be replaced very early on due to obnoxious creaking (covered by warranty though).  One of the rear doors needed to be done twice.  Other than that there has been general maintenance, but nothing major. 

I would recommend this car to  a large group of people.  It seems to have been classed as a bit of a &quot;chick car&quot; but I think with the right detailing and color it could fit both genders.  I bought it when I was in my early 20s and it has lasted into my late 20s and I will probably have it for a few more good years.  It seems that it would be a good car for a family because of the room.  

I probably will not go with a VW next time around, as it was this particular body style that I liked.  So, I am not one of those die-hard loyal VW people.  But I have really enjoyed driving this car.

Go Jetta!
