            I needed a reliable vehicle with a good price.  We purchased a 99 Kia Sephia in Oct. 99 and have had it in the shop 6 times.  The car is cute and that's about as far as it goes.  I have had nothing but problems.  At 7,000 miles the brakes warped and again not even 3000 miles later they warped again.  Had to replace things in the clutch, fuel system, and several more, not so major things, on the this car.  I have been stranded 3 times and had to call a tow truck.  I am in the process of calling this car a lemon and getting Kia to give me my money back.  I have seen several reviews on bad brakes for this vehicle also.  Next time I buy a vehicle I will definitely check the internet for reviews and thoughts!  To say, my boyfriend purchased a 2000 Kia and has had no problems with it at all.  <br><br>
