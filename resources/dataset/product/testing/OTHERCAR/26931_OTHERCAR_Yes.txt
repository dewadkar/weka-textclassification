            I have a Toyota Camry 98 CE, V6 ,standard transmission  and I'm proud of it.I used to drive a Toyota RAV 4 before I got this car,the difference between the two is huge,the moment I stepped on the gas I automatically felt the love ,the power coming out of the V6 engine is so refreshing,not crisp but somehow aggressive.To get that crisp feeling I'm talking about the engine needs a Supercharger,that would add somewhere in the vicinity of 80 HP to an already powerful engine(193/4 HP),the move is costly though,around 3500 dollars.
The standard transmission it's a dream,shifting up and down is poetry,smooth and stylish and if the clutch is handled right there is nothing but fluent motion,superb.
The interior is roomy with plenty of room all around,the seats are comfortable ,I have driven the car for hours without feeling any discomfort or the need to stop ,easy to reach and turn on /off cruise control.
As far the handling goes it's an amazing machine,stays solid on the road at all speeds,driven up and down the mountain behaves like no other,the powerful engine never lets you guessing,stays like "glued" in curves at high speeds,the so called soft suspension responds adequately.
One of the biggest flaws is the front suspension,the struts are noisy when the car is being driven over bumps and cracks in the road ,the noise can be heard at low speeds.New tires seem to subdue the noise but not by much.
The steering wheel squeaks when turned all the way to the left or to the right.
I would do the following to make a Camry a better car:
-add a supercharger for extra power,that way the car would be able to compete against the best(BMW,Acura and so on)
-Get 17 or 18 inches wheels ,those would bring wider tires so consequently better control and better handling ,no need to change the struts.
-a high performance sound system.
-for its aesthetic value add new had lamps the present ones are to small,the ones on the 99 and 00 models look better.
