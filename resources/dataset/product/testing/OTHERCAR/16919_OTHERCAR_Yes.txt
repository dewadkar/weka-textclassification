            Our family purchased an OUTBACK wagon (loaded with leather seats, etc) after owning a &quot;plain&quot; wagon for 5 years.  I was impressed by the fact that for 5 years I owned my previous Suburu wagon, I needed only to take the car in for regular service intervals and had no other problems, except replacing the brakes.  When buying the car , we looked at the Lexus RS300 and several other SUVs.  We chose the Suburu OUTBACK as the best deal for our money, although the Lexus RS300 had a quieter ride, and more roomier feel. If I had an additional 15,000 dollars I might have been tempted by this one!
We have been extremely pleased by this car!  With the all wheel drive it handles great in bad weather, from snow  to rain.  You feel safe driving the car and it has responded beautifully on slick roads.   My wife loves the higher ground clearance of the car; it gives you some chance to see with the taller SUVs on the road.  It does great in our neighborhood, handling all those speed bumps with ease and comfort.  As a road car it made a great 3000 mile trip to the mountains and back at Thanksgiving.  It is an easy car to drive and very comfortable, even after sitting for 12 hours!  Your back does not hurt and you do not feel punished for driving like some of the cars I rented feel after only 2-3 hours in them!  And it gets close to 24 miles to the gallon on the road, something those SUVs cannot compete with. Oh, and the stereo is really good!
The only things disappointing to us is the road noise as compared to a more luxury car.  We had a few quirks with this new car, including the doors not shutting properly that were fixed under warranty.  Our kids have said that the back seat is roomy, but not as comfortable as the front seat.  We have never tried it out.
This is a car for the person who wants what an SUV can do and never does them, with the additional safety of all wheel drive and a car type ride.  The OUTBACK went up rough dirt roads in the mountains with no problem.  After renting an SUV on work assignments, I am impressed with the more car like ride and comfort of the OUTBACK.  It is not an SUV as far as steel content, size and roominess.   It will not substitute for those &quot;suburban warriors&quot; who want massive power and size and room.   But if you want a more nimble, comfortable car with enough cargo space for taking 2 kids around, this might be for you.  We are sure glad we have this all wheel drive car to help us maneuver around those big SUVs being driven sometimes  by those who think they are indestructable.  Not for me!
