            I have always loved Rivieras ever since I was first introduced to them.  They are pure examples of the true American Luxury Coupe.  They were built to fully satisfy the wants of their select clientel.  So, a month before my 15th birthday, I found a gorgeous Rivi at a local dealer.  It is two tone: Navy blue metallic on top, gray on bottom.  I convinced me parents to buy it for me as I had fallen in love with the car on the spot.  So, for over a year, we drove the car only once a week, putting only eight thousand miles on it (this put it at 75,000 mi).  I then recieved my permit and got to drive it myself.  I now have my liscense, and have decided that there are few cars in the world that would please me as much as my Buick Riviera.  After buying it, I recieved endless praises on its looks and comfort.  Because I feel these will become collectors items, I intend to keep it until I die.  <br><br>
