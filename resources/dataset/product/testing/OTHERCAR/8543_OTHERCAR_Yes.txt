            I leased my Jx model and have had no major problems.  I've owned lots of convertibles and this one has the biggest backseat, biggest trunkspace and is the 1st one that doesn't leak(yet)!  The driver side & passenger side door panels are frequent problems and never have been fixed correctly. They rattle constantly.  The cheesy wheel covers are a bone of contention also because they chatter if not tightened and attached properly. Definitely get the V6 version. As someone who always uses the dealer for all repairs & maintenance, Chrysler is off the mark in comparison to other makers like Cadillac,Toyota.
