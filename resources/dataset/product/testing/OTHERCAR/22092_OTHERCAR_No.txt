            Hi,
  
   The DC215 is very attractive, and would recommend it to novices.  I am a computer science major in college, and I work for a professional photography comany part time. I have to admit that this camera is one of the easiest to use.  Here are the pro's:

<b>2x optical zoom is beneficial for framing your shots
Compact, stlyish design
1 megapixel
Kodak quality written all over it</b>

<b>Cons:</b> (I am picky, these are the little things that bugged me, but may not bug you)

   They say it will print 5x7 photoquality prints, but I had some digital prints made professionaly (4x6's), and they were not photo quality. You can easily see the pixels.  Trust me on this- it will not replace your current 35mm or APS camera.
   The LCD is not bright or sharp.  It looks like a Dual scan screen on a laptop computer, not sharp and fast like a TFT screen
   Shots taken  by looking at the LCD are about 10% off center (I was suprised at this)
   Compared to the LCD screen on the olympus 340R($300), this screen is a serious con. 
   The tripod mount is placed very oddly, and looks weak.
   The compact flash eject button does not eject the card far enough.  My big fingers cannot reach in to pull it out, so I have to tap it.

<b>Overall:</b>

    This is a good digital camera, but do not plan to make photo-quality prints from this.  If you have the budget, get the coolpix 950 or the newer 990.  They will knock your socks off.  This camera will not satisfy a techie (like me), but if you can get it for a good price, you will have a good beginner camera that has  quality workmanship.<br><br>
