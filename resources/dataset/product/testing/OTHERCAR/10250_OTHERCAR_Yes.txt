            The speed, the looks, the power, the slick ride..its all here. The 3000GT, it's every mans dream. This car can beat out any car except a viper. With its 320 horses it can race against anything. This car is the most fastest and popular car on the market. Even though they stopped making these cars, they will continue to get popular. There is a limited amount of these cars on the market now and few people have them. But I tell you this, any owner who has one of these is proud of them. You can see them coming from 100's of feet away. With this speed demon you will own the road. If you take care of it, you will get maximum quality out of it. The Dodge Stealth is just as good also. They both look alike, and have the same engine. But the 3000gt is better in my opinion. This is because it is all foreign parts. I highly recommend this car to anyone that can afford a high insurrance car and loves to go fast and loves to show off his/her car.<br><br>
