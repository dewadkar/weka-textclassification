            I bought this camera about two months ago at sears. I must say I was a little nervous about spending so much on a camera, but I have three kids and wanted to get more pictures of them and wanted them to look good. I can tell you first of all I was amazed at the ease of use. The auto focus works very well. With the IBM microdrive included with the camera will hold over 850 pictures on the fine setting or 80 totally uncompressed which really makes a difference in quality. It will also take up to 50 minutes of quality video and audio at the rate of up to 30 frames per second. The LCD screen on the back is very clear. The camera comes complete with not only the microdrive, but an 8 meg compact flash card, two sets of ni-mh batteries, battery charger, and adapter for the microdrive or compact flash to fit in a pcmcia slot on a notebook computer. The last thing I want to cover is the Zoom. This camera has no optical zoom, but has a 2x digital zoom which is sufficient for great photos in most cases.
