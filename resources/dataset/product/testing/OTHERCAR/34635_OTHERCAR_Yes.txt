            I love my Montana!  (OK, I admit it wouldn't take much for me to fall in love with a vehicle after wrestling with two child car seats in my last car, a 2-door 1988 Mazda MX-6!)  Family friendly was my prime objective when purchasing my new minvan in January 2000.  I wanted a dependable vehicle that would easily accommodate car seats for my infant and toddler and would have room for a double stroller and lots of groceries in back.

The main reason I went with a GM product was I had accumulated $3500 thru the GM Mastercard rewards program, and there was a $2000 rebate at the time I purchased my Montana.  I choose the Pontiac Montana over the other 2 GM minivans (Chevy Venture and Olds Silhouette) out of appearance more than anything else.

I got everything I was looking for and more with my Montana.  Because space was an issue, I went with the extended version which has more room behind the back seat.  My seating configuration is the first two rows of captains chairs and a split bench seat in back which can seat 3 passengers, for a total possible seating load of 7.  We have had 4 car seats and 3 adults at one time, a little uncomfortable for the adult that's between the 2 car seats in the back but it can be done!  The split rear bench flips forward easily when you need to have space for a large load.

I went for one very pricey option (which I rationalized by thinking about my GM Mastercard earnings), MontanaVision, the tv/vcr option.  I haven't regretted that decision once, it has saved me from fussy, whining kids on numerous occasions, and I've often used it to lure my kids out of a store they didn't want to leave!  The tv folds down from the ceiling so you still have room between the two front seats unlike with some floor model tvs.

The Montana is easy and fun to drive.  I had driven another company's minivan and felt almost like I was driving a bus, but the Montana isn't that different from driving a car.  Parking takes a little getting used to, but otherwise it is fine.

The only minor problem I experienced with the van since I purchased it was the passenger side rear view mirror didn't work properly.  The dealer quickly replaced it for me free of charge.

If I could change one thing about the Montana I would want power sliding doors on both sides, rather than on just one side as it is now.

All in all, I am very satisfied and feel I got a good value for my money.  I would highly recommend the Montana.
