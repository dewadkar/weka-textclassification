            This has been a pretty good car so far.  GREAT gas mileage.  Tons of interior room, much more then any car this size!  Big trunk that can hold 2 ex girlfriends AND a chainsaw at the same time!

Factory radio is cheap.  Save your money and buy an aftermarket radio as the upgraded stereo is never worth the money charged when compared with aftermarket!

Held up well to very serious accident (I knew I shouldn't have let her drive it).  

The only major issue with this vehicle so far has been the extensive number of times it has been in to repair the electric windows which are barely even used.  It has 44K miles on it and has been in 9 or 10 times for the windows.  It hasn't been that major of an issue due to the extended warranty covering the rental each time but I wouldn't want to own it outside of the 100K extended warranty.  But then again I would never buy a new car without the extended warranty and have never had one yet where the warranty didn't pay for itself at least 5 times over!
