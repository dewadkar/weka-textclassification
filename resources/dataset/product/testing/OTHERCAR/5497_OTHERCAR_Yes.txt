            I own a 92-chevy Cavalier, and I love it. I bought it some 6 months ago, and before that I had been driving only Japanese makes. It was only after driving Cavalier, I came to know what driving pleasure was? Japanese cars are though economical and a bit stylish, but when it comes to luxury, power and driving pleasure, I found Cavalier the best so far. It also has the styling and that appealing outlook that will catch every passer-by's look. I remember driving my previous car (Toyota Corolla 90) on a windy day, on the highway, and all the time I was just worried to make home safely. And on a similar windy and rainy day, driving my Cavalier on a highway, I only enjoyed my drive, and unbelievably the weather. I simply love my Cavalier. <br><br>
