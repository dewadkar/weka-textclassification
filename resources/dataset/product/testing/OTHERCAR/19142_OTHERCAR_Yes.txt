              My brother and I were shopping for a car and decided to go for the Passat.  We got it at a very good deal- lower part of the range.  Of course, this is because its the 4 cyl. version, and stick, but it was also because we did lots of research on the net.  

THe good stuff:  great looking dash (it lights up in red and purple at night), great interior (ex. the seats are very firm,  good lumbar support, etc.), the ride is great too (handles bumps very well).

THe only complaint we have is that parts are a pain to get.  Dealing with foreign cars, esp. German manufacturers, is seemingly a pain.  Unfortunately, someone tried breaking in and it needed a new locking mechanism which took forever to get.  <br><br>
