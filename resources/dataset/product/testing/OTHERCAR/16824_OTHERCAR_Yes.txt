            I own a 94'Z28 and simply love it.  The car delivers the best performance for the money than any other.  I normally don't drive that hard, but when the road calls, the Z28 responds without hesitation.  In this car, you feel like you are part of the road, not just driving on it.  Acceleration is phenomenal and handling is silk smooth.  The car is heavy so if you like the light European style car, this is not for you.  For you Mustang fans, my father recently traded his 94' Mustang GT convertable for a 2000 Z28 and his first comment was &quot;the Camaro is much faster and more responsive than the Mustang ever was!&quot;  If you purchase a Camaro, don't bother with the 6 cylinder, the Z28 or the SS is the only way to go.  I have had this car for two years and have had no trouble whatsoever.  The only thing not stock is the K&amp;N filtercharger.  I don't have a good comparison of this product because it was installed prior to purchase.  However, to my knowledge it provide a considerable upgrade power.  The only mistake I made was purchasing the automatic transmission.  I feel the car would be much more fun to drive if I had the 6 speed option.  I also have the performance axle option which increases low end performance (like it needed it).  I love this car and wouldn't trade it for the world.<br><br>
