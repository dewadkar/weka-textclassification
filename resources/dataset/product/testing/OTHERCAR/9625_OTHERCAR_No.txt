            Don't try this at home. I mean driving this vehicle. This is very dangerous to your health. To drive this in the snow. Or to just drive this vehicle, it does slide very badly in inclement weather. When I bought this vehicle back in 1996, I thought I was getting a real deal. With the rebate that I was getting I felt pretty good about this deal. Well, as I found out a few hours later, this was not to be. If you have one of these be very careful, don't fall into the same trap that I fell into. I bought this for my daughter, thinking that it is safe for her to drive. Or try and get rid of it and trade it in. 

It all started out about 2 hours later, when I was involved in a rear-end accident, and the air bags did not activate. Then the engine spun a main bearing. Yes they did fix everything on this vehicle. Also we had a bad hail storm which put a lot of damage to this vehicle. But you should not have to go through all this. But wait, there is more! Two months ago I was involved in a deadly accident that almost killed me. The car flipped over three times and landed on top of me. I almost died. With all this I have to tell you that the car did not handle very well on damp pavement. It would slip all over the place.

Even though I had all these problems with this vehicle it did still start up when I wanted it to. Never had a problem with that. This particular one cost approximately 16,000$ Dollars. The whole time I had this vehicle it did not rust one little bit. There is another problem with this car that you need to know about and that is that it doesn't hold it's value at all. When I had been paying on this car for over three years and the car was a total loss. You would expect that the insurance company would be able to pay off the whole vehicle, but that was not to be. I still owed $2,400.00 and some change. 

There was nothing special about this car, no added features, just the basics. I bought this with the intention in mind for my kid to have safe vehicle to drive. But as I found out this is not true. This had a soft top that also had to be replaced cause it fell apart. Plus when it got real cold the back window that is supposed to not break, did. It cracked somehow.

Also every 16,000 miles we had to replace the front brakes. Other than that we didn't have any problems. As long as the road is dry and it is nice out side, it is a safe bet you should get to where you are going to. At the time I purchased this vehicle I bought this car as a convienence. But sometimes you need to take a couple of deep breaths so you don't make the same mistake that I did. Plus I would not recommend taking any long trips in this vehicle. The seats are not very comfortable for long periods. Plus not much room to stretch when you have a full load of people in the car.

Oh yes, the tires were still good when this car was was totaled, still had a lot of tread left on them. This did come with power steering, power brakes, AM/FM stereo radio cassette player. Which sounded ok. Power windows, only if you used your arms enough, and power locks if you hit them down hard enough. 

Like I said before, the only thing that I could find good after all this, is that it did always start up when I was able to drive it. But maybe it was a blessing that it was wrecked beyond repair. That way no one did get killed. Just hurt and still mending.

In my opinion they should stop selling these type of vehicles. I have always heard about these vehicle flipping over, but never seen one in action. Well, now I have found out first hand. Please don't let your loved ones drive this vehicle. I can't stop anyone from buying this car, but what I can do, is tell everyone about my experiences with this car. And it is not good. Don't really know if this car was jinxed from the start.

Sorry, but I usually write on things that I can Highly Recommend, but this is not the case here. This is not a good buy. Save your money and put it towards a vehicle that holds it's value. And that is safer to drive than this.
