            I don't own this car personally but my roommate does. I drive it now more than I drive my own cause to be honest, its a lot better to drive then my 1995 Neon. It looks good, drive pretty good, and is great on gas.

My roommate brought this car in early January of 2000. When she told me she was buying it, I really wasn't to sure about it cause of all the stories you hear about these types of vehicles having the problem with tipping over or that the chances of them tipping are greater then most vehicles.

After she brought it home I was able to take it out for a ride. When getting into it, I wasn't use to such a high sitting vehicle cause of having my Neon, which sits very low to the ground. In fact I never realized how low until I started driving the Kia Sportage. I noticed right off since it does sit so high, the viewing within the vehicle is much better. You are looking down on things, instead of up. As in when you come on to another vehicle. It's easier to see how much space you have between the two cars.

They also put a really good radio with CD player in this vehicle. The sound is clear and crisp. When driving and if you happen to hit a pot hole or something of the sort, your CD player does not skip. Living in the Dallas/Ft Worth area, this is a very good thing cause this area is really bad when it comes to having pot holes in the road. I have driven other vehicles and the CD player skip when hitting the slightest bump but not with this car.

After driving it for a while I have taken notice of some things I really don't like about this vehicles though. One is the fact that when it is really windy out side, the car feels like it is all over the road. At times I would go away from driving it with my palms hurting cause I was gripping so hard on the wheel to keep in on the road and in the lane. It seems to be lighter then my Neon, which I also have a hard time keeping it in the lane wind windy but no near as bad.

Another thing is when taking a tight corner, some times it feels like the car could either flip or skid. Not that it has, it just feels like it does. So I slow way down just to feel safe. Other cars behind me don't like it to much but my safety comes first. When taking those not so tight corners, like at lights and so on, it doesn't seem to take the corners as well as my Neon does. Not that my Neon is any better cause it really isn't but this is the only other car I have to compare it to at this time. The steering wheel on the Kia Sportage seems to be a bit stiff, which is what I feel makes the turns seem harder to take at times. It almost feels like turning a big truck, something like a big Ford or something.

On the other hand with the stiff steering wheel it is easy to drive all around. The Neon I have has a very lose wheel and tends to have a lot of lead way when driving. I don't like that a whole lot. I like the feel of having control over what my vehicle does and does not do. I don't want a lot of play in the wheel while driving in case some thing happens and I need at act quickly.

I have also noticed that with the Kia Sportage, the &quot;get up and go&quot; just is not there.In fact, my little 1995 Neon has more &quot;get up and go&quot; then this 2000 Kia Sportage. In the area I live in we have a lot of high ways and to be honest at times I just don't trust pulling out in traffic with this vehicle. It seems to take for ever to get up to at least 60mp. 

All around this vehicle is a quiet ride. The windows seem to leak a little air but not as much as my Neon. The gas mileage is great though. We can fill it up (yes I buy gas for it since I drive it so much. I don't think I have driven my Neon in a few weeks now) and from a full tank get a little over 260miles out of it. That includes the stop and go and traffic we have to deal with in the Big D.

In all I like this vehicle. It looks great and for long road trips is a great deal cause you can save money on the gas. The seat are comfy but after, I would say, about a 6-8 hour drive you will be glad to get out and give you butt a rest. And since the back seats can fold all the way up, you can fit loads of food in there after taking a visit to the store or if you are on a long trip you call the seats all the way up and let the kids play or take a nap and be comfy.

In closing, it's a good car to have, they just need to work and some of the small details I have pointed out to make it a better vehicle to drive. I feel safe and comfy for the most part in this car and like showing it off as if it were my own.
