            To Whom it may concern:
I recently purchase a Digital Camera, AGFA EPhoto Smile...... I do not like it, it takes horrible pictures, 
They are fuzzy, distorted, and just plain ugly color, I would like to return the camera, and get a refund.... I had an  expert camera man looking at it , and says its not a good camera.... and if he were ME , he would send it back too....  Please send to me the the Mailing address to return the Camera to you.....  I purchased this Camera under my old name 

My Daughter and i took pictures, and they came out horrible, she said if she were me, she would throw it away... My son in law also said the same thing... Now does it not tell you, the Camera is not one to be boosting about.... Thank you .... Unhappy Customer.  I would appreciate if you would please return my money to me at once..... i will send the camera back to you immediately .....<br><br>
