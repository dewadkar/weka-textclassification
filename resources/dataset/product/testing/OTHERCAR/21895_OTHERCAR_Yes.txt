            This car is pure enjoyment and a complete package, regardless of your driving style. But make no mistake, it is clearly a driver's car. If you enjoy driving - anywhere, anyplace, at any speed, you'll love this vehicle. If it's basic transportation you want, buy a Ford Focus. 
I have the 528i sport package and absolutely love it. The car is the perfect blending of sport and luxury. It has all the creature comforts you expect from a 40K+ car, yet it behaves like a performance vehicle when you need it. My only complaint, other than the fact that I'm jealous of the 540 and M5 owners', (since they get all the same amenities and MORE power!)is the cup holder. Yes, I know, it's a petty complaint to be sure. But hey, given the engineering marvel that the car represents, it seems like the only thing that was an afterthought.  <br><br>
