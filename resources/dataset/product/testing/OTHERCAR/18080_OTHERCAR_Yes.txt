            I bought a new 1996 Dodge Neon in April 1996.  This was my first new car, and I have been very pleased with the purchase.  I have what is called the &quot;baseline&quot; which means it has A/C and AM/FM cassette and that is about it.  It is also a 5-speed manual, which I love.  This car gets excellent gas mileage, around 27 mpg city, and 32 mpg highway.  It is quick off the line, and has good passing capabilities.  I have been pretty good (not great, I admit) at keeping the oil changed regularly.  I have had very little mechanical difficulty with this car.  I have had to replace a couple of oil seals, and understand this is a common problem on this model, but it wasn't an expensive repair.  I got its first tune-up recently, at around 110,000 miles.  I know, some of you shudder at this!  But I figure, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  (And I don't recommend others be as slack as me.)  The point of this is that the car has been very reliable and has consistently ran well.  One drawback is that if the wheels are even slightly out of alignment, you will go through tires very quickly.  Any aligment problems should be addressed as soon as noticed.  The Neon also doesn't have a ton of horsepower, so don't expect to be able to fly up steep inclines in fifth gear.  Fourth gear will work nicely for mountain driving.  Overall, I liked my 96 Neon so much, that my husband and I bought a second Neon: this one is a 2000 ES.<br><br>
