            As with all products, I did a lot of research before I bought the PowerShot A20.  I havent been disappointed.

<b>The nitty gritty</b>
The camera is a 2.1 megapixel camera.  This has allowed me to take pictures in 1280 x 960 resolution and get them developed into a great looking 5x7 photo.  The quality of the photos have been very good.  Other resolutions are 1024 x 768 and 640 x 480.  If you are taking pictures to e-mail to friends and family, you will want to go with the lower resolutions.

The camera also sports a 3x optical zoom with a 7.5x digital zoom.  The digital zoom works OK, but zoom in to far and your pictures will not come out clear.

<b>The photos</b>

This camera has taken some really good pictures in various lighting conditions.  The whole reason that I bought a digital camera is that I'm too lazy to take regular film somewhere to get it developed.  Also, I prefer pictures in a digital format rather than an actual photo.  They are easier to store when they are digital.

One cool feature of this camera is the stitch assist.  When shooting in this mode, the camera helps you take pictures that can later be combined into a panorama.

<b>Battery life</b>

My only complaint about this camera is battery life.  Like most digital cameras, the PowerShot A20 eats batteries in a relatively short period of time.  The cameras documentation states that you can take about 500 pictures with the LCD screen turned off.  I've been able to average about 300-400 pictures before the batteries die on me.  With the LCD turned on, I've averaged about 100-150.

<b>Summary</b>

This is an excellent camera for beginners and leisure picture takers.  It is easy to use and takes quality pictures that are suitable for 5x7 enlargements.
