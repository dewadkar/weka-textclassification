            I purchased this camera after the birth of my daughter.
Both my wife and I love it.  It is extremely simple to use in all function modes. For the money spent, this camera is a fantastic deal, and in my opinion, is comparable to many models that I have seen and use (as far as picture quality -the more expensive models do have more functions, but not anything that can't be added or edited after you download to your computer).
The camera has six different quality levels for picture taking - three in half mode and three in full mode. We have operated this camera in the full - two star mode for the most part. This has produced some very beautiful 8x10 pictures with very good colour and clarity. I use a 128 mb smart media card with the camera and I can get 207 images in this mode. In the half - one star mode you get 1248 pictures, which is fine for 4x6 images.
I have seen many reviews complaining about the battery life of this and other cameras. I have not found this to be a problem. On a recent trip, a freshly charged set of batteries last and entire 128mb card, allowed me to review the pictures and download them to my computer. From what I have seen, this is an above average performance measure.
The one draw back to this camera is the small view finder and picture monitor. It performs somewhat poorly in high light conditions, which has made it difficulty to use my telephoto and wide angle lens. That aside, when indoors, the view finder is more that functional for taking and reviewing pictures.  For the most part, we do not even use it.
All functions on the camera are easily displayed and very functional. Anyone can learn to use this camera without difficulty.
