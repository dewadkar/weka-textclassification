            Greetings to all, I currently own a 98 5spd Es. At first it was one of those 'settle' cars. You know the one you want you cant afford, and this is a compromise. Needless to say I was suprised at what I really had.  This little car has been with me for 50k miles with not a single problem. In the meantime I have gotten into the import racing scene and found there is a small fanatical following for this car. Several modifications have been made to make this car faster. The only problem I ever had was the incredible noise generated by the stock tires. This has been corrected by up-sizing to a 205/50/14 wheel size. The other problem was chassis flex in the front end. This has been corrected with a strut bar .Now this little car corners like its on rails. This is the perfect car to race around in as no one thinks a 'family' car should be noticed... Now many people are thanks to Sport compact Car magazine and my website http://www.geocities.com/lonestarrd... This car is Great , and only suffers from poor marketing strategy from Mazda. I'd buy another in a heartbeat.....<br><br>
