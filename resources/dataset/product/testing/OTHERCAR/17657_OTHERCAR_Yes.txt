            In 1998, I purchased a used 1996 Nissan XE pickup. It had 12,000 miles at the time. Today, it has 120,000. I replaced the alternator at about 95,000 miles ($70 installed myself), rear shocks at 100,000 ($30), and a clutch at about 110,000 miles ($450). 

I consistently get 27 miles per gallon. The transmission is smooth.  I've made 12 hour trips in the Nissan, but I'd prefer nicer seats. I have a bench seat and whether you're driving or a passenger, it feels like the seat makes you lean slightly toward the center.  The ride is quite noisy.  The truck simply isn't airtight enough to keep out the noise. 

The 2.4 liter motor does not put out a lot of power, especially when the a/c is on. I have never towed anything, but I've hauled a lot of things in the bed.  Payloads of 1,000 lbs make the truck handle boat-like, but power and braking are fine.  

Overall though, I have been so impressed with the Nissan that in 2001 I purchased a 1998 Nissan Altima for my wife. My Nissan truck still looks good and runs as well as ever. I plan to keep it till it dies, which I hope will be sometime after 200,000 miles.  

At around 30,000 miles, I was hit in the rear by a woman looking through her purse while driving.  The impact pushed in the bumper and made the truck bed shift very slightly.  Only by measuring the space on each side between the cab and the bed and comparing the measurements could I even be sure that it did shift.  That shift made me concerned, though, that the frame might have bent.  I took the truck to 3 auto-body shops and they all told me the same thing. No way. Each one said that a Nissan frame is extremely strong and would not have bent.  One even told me that had I been driving a Dodge, he'd bet it would have bent.  That's a pretty good recommendation for the Nissan, in my book. The total repair bill was $270 (including labor) to replace the rear bumper and its mounting hardware.  Contrast that with those plastic cars that have $2,000 in damage during a 5 mph crash test.

If you want a great, reliable truck at a pleasant price, get the Nissan. If you don't mind paying thousands more for things like a quieter ride and nicer seats, then you might go with a Toyota.

When this truck eventually does die, I will most likely buy another Nissan truck.
