            When I was test driving trucks to decide what I liked before I bought my Ranger I tried out a '93 S10 2.2 4 cylender. Here are some of the impressions i jotted down at the time as compared to the 4cyl., rwd, regular cab Ranger I also tried and eventually bought.

    Interior: The seats were flat and uncomfortable, with limited adjustment. There was no center console. I can't really comment on the radio, as it was a used truck with an aftermarket CD player. All controls were fairly easy to reach though. But not nearly as comfy as the Ranger I ended up deciding on. I would have liked a 60/40 split bench with folding center armrest and console like I later found in the Ranger instead of the solid cloth one in the S10. I felt like I was sitting way too low with my legs splayed out in front, whereas the seating position in the Ranger is more upright. My mother, who would sometimes be driving the truck, found it impossible to get comfortable in the driver's seat. In the Ranger it is much easier for more drivers to get comfortable. There is also more interior storage space. I felt like I had more head room, shoulder room, hip room, and legroom. 

   Driving impressions: The 2.2 liter 4 cyl. felt sluggish and way overworked. I did my best to get some kind of pickup out of it by working the 5 speed manual but the loose, ruberry feel and the touchy clutch didn't make matters easier. My Ranger's 4 cyl. is quite peppy with a 5speed though it is by no means a hot rod.

          You would think first would be a strong gear but in this truck it felt like I was starting out in 2nd or third. No matter how careful I was this truck would not shift smoothly. In my Ranger I have been able to get a good jump on quite a few surprised sedans and V6 SUV's. The 5speed manual shifter is tighter and the clutch is smoother.

Inside the bed: The S10 seemed to offer more tie downs and a slightly wider bed, but not by much. It sat a little lower and was easier to load.
          One thing I have to give the S10 is highway stability. It sat lower than the Ranger, and was a more stable vehicle at speeds of up to even 90 -95 mph. IT took much more to get the axle to hop around than it does in the Ranger.
Styling: An admittedly subjective category, but I like the styling on 2wd rangers better than that on S10's. The Ranger has a more upright, macho stance, whereas the Chevy slouches too much and looks kind of like a slug.
     
    I took the S10 on a nice 2 hour test drive and by the time I got it back the engine was running more roughly and making a wierd clicking sound. My Ranger's 2.3 still runs like new with  57,000 miles on the odometer.

   I can't say much about the more upscale V6 versions of these trucks as I haven't driven them. But If you're looking for a stripper with a few nice amenities the Ranger offers more comfort for the money and better performance.
