                Are you ready for this? I currently own a 1992 Mitsubishi 3000gt vr-4  Now let me give you some facts from my point of view.  First off, contrary to belief this car is in fact made for speed!  A certain kind of speed hardly no other car can duplicate.  This speed I speak of, is massive g-forces U N L E A S H E D  by the all wheel drive system, with limited slip differential.  Imagine being able to rip off a 0-30mph time in an amazing 1.7 seconds.  Now, ask yourself this, can a stock dodge viper with 400 some ponies do this?  Your answer is NO!  
    Here is where it gets even better.  Not only do these Mitsu's have an astonishing  quarter mile time of 13.5, but can you think of any car able to do this and be able to get up to 17 miles to the gallon in the city? Are you thinking of taking the adventure of owning one of these bad foreign monsters.  Well the list just got started!
    How about a car with a reliable electronic suspension to stabilize an every day driven car as well as the Porsche 911's? Well if so hop in the Mitsubishi 3000gt vr-4 top ten voted most likely to attract women in the US!  The vr-4's come standard with leather, cd player, and all options you could possibly want and more!  Now ask your self this &quot; DO I WANT A CAR THAT WILL GET THE CHICKS AND KILL ALMOST ANY CAR YOU SEE ON THE ROAD!&quot;
If yes, you won't regret it!  If no, i'm sorry but no fun for you this year!<br><br>
