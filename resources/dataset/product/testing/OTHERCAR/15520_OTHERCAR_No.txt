            This review is based on a 14-month ownership period, after which the car was traded in.

When the Z-car was announced to make a comeback in 2002, I was the first in line to jump on the bandwagon and put a deposit down at my local Nissan dealer.  In September of 2002, My Redline Performance 6MT 350Z had arrived!  Much to my joy, I started her up, and thought to myself, I'm going to have the time of my life!  Boy, was I wrong.  I've had numerous warranty issues, along with three transmission replacements, uneven tire wear issues, and other inherent 350Z problems that many suffer as I have.  

In the rare instances the car was actually in an operational state, the drive was quite fun on weekend getaway trips upstate, where I can really stretch her legs, and have a little fun.  The transmission could use some improvement, as the shifts are very notchy and could prove to be stressful in everyday driving.  (Nissan has supposedly redesigned the transmission for 2004, my experiences are based on the early build 2003 model) The car felt a bit twitchy when driven to its extremes, partially due to the horrible rubber that Nissan provides on all 350Z models.  Replacing the stock wheels with Volks TE37s and Bridgestone S03 tires alleviated the handling issues, but is hardly an acceptable solution to a 30k+ vehicle.  The car had more than enough power to hold its own against some pretty hefty competition at the local drag strip, with power output I estimate to be equivalent to the mid-90s Camaro Z28 LT1.  

The styling of the new Z Car is quite eye-catching, as it will turn heads everywhere you go.  The aluminum-finished door handles add a touch of eccentricity in the overall design of the car.  The 350Z takes styling cues from past Z cars and integrates them into a contemporary look.  The taillight design accentuates the aggressive exterior design of the 350Z.

A few of the other niggling issues that I had with this Z car was the lack of a sunroof option, an obnoxious rear strut tower brace which eliminates what small amount of cargo space there is, and if you plan on buying a 350Z as a daily driver, consider that there will be times that a certain amount of utility may be needed, and make your purchase decisions wisely.  

I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the 350Z, and this is after owning the car for 14 months.  The car has many issues (some lingering into the 04 models) some being significant, others being niggling annoyances that will start getting to you.  If you're in the market for a 350Z, I urge you to test drive an S2000 or RX-8 before you make your decision.  The 350Z, while impressive on paper, is not exactly a number-one choice for overall drivability.  Nissan may have created an "affordable sports car", but this car ain't no fun.  Try an S2000 or RX-8.  Then drive the 350Z.  You may be pleasantly surprised.  

-- I have since traded the 350Z in for a 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe 6MT.  I will post a review on this vehicle at a future date.
