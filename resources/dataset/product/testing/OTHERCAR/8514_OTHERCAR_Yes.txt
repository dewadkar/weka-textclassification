            I have to admit it, I wasn't exactly thrilled when my husband brought home the <b>2001 Dodge Ram 1500</b>. We were supposed to be looking at minivans, not trucks. I was the one driving kids and a dog around, running all the errands, grocery shopping- all those nice little hectic things a mom of two small children and a 65 pound, four legged fur face has to do every day. A truck didn't fit my needs. I had a ton of questions for him. <i>Where am I supposed to put the dog? What if it's raining when we go to the store? Am I supposed to cram myself, two kids and $200 worth of food into the cab? Surely you don't expect me to put our precious fur baby in the bed? To chance being struck by all manner of road debris that gets kicked up while driving? I don't think so! And you know how it can rain here. Sunny one minute, pouring the next. Grocery bags in the back will get ruined and I am not climbing in back there to cover them all up with a tarp.</i> Like I said, I wasn't thrilled with owning a truck. I felt more like looking for the nearest wall to bang my head against.

Our <b>Dodge Ram 1500 SLT</b> is loaded with an AM,FM cassette,cd stereo, very cold air conditioning, three cup holders up front, a pullout two cup holder in back, a 12v-20A power outlet, cloth seats, fold down front seat center console, driver and front passenger air bags, a cut off switch for the passenger side air bag, cruise control, tilt steering wheel and power doors, windows and mirrors. Our's has a small V8 manual transmission. If you're not used to driving a stick, there is a little arrow which lights up on the tachometer to indicate when you should shift gears. 

<b>The Interior</b>

<i>The Dash</i>

The instrument panel on the <b>Dodge Ram 1500 SLT</b> is well laid out and the tachometer, speedometer, battery, water, oil and fuel gages are easy to read. The back lighting is green, so scanning them at night is easy on the eyes. The cruise control buttons are located on the steering wheel and the parking brake release is located in the usual lower left spot. Instead of the usual little handle to grip, it is the same molded plastic as the dash and very easy to find without looking. The hood release is located directly under the steering column and is also easy to find and grip without looking. The light controls are in the upper left corner of the dash and the climate and stereo controls are to the driver's right. The fold down center console is spacious enough for our laptop, has a compartment for compact discs and quarter, nickel and dime holders. The latch to open it could be placed better but it's not totally unworkable. There are two small cubby type compartments in the dash. The smallest one to the right of the stereo is the perfect size for a cell phone and has a rubber bottom so it won't slide out. If you are going to use your cell phone when driving, please do so responsibly. The larger one under the stereo will easily fit a small box of tissues. Once you've driven the truck long enough to become familiar with where everything is, you can easily find all the buttons without taking your eyes off the road. 


<i>The Seats</i>

I like the cloth seats primarily because I've never been a big fan of leather or vinyl seats, especially during extreme cold or heat. We've already had one instance of a car sick toddler and the cloth seat in back cleaned up nicely with no stains. As a vertically challenged person, I really like the placement of the front seat belts. They are on the seat itself and not the truck's frame. Since I have to move the seat pretty far forward to drive, I don't get choked by the seat belt. As a shorter member of our society, this particular feature gets a big two thumbs up. In addition to moving forward and back, you can also adjust the incline of your seat to sit as straight or laid back as you'd like.
The back seat is not going to be comfortable for the vertically endowed. However, it does fit two car seats rather nicely and our children aren't cramped. You could probably even get a third car seat in without hearing the <i>I'm squished</i> complaints. Note though, this will not help with the <i>She's touching me! He touched me first!</i> volleying that goes on. When they finally outgrow the need for car seats, they should still be comfortable sitting back there for a few more years.

<i>The Doors</i>

I'm one of those people who like a solid sounding door. It should shut with a nice deep <i>thump</i>. The doors on the <b>Dodge Ram 1500 SLT</b> do exactly that. The doors are slightly rounded on the inside which adds to the roomy feel of the interior. Many moons ago we owned a Chevy truck and I didn't get that same feeling with the straight up and down doors. Both doors have a molded small compartment above the handle where you can put little things like a pack of gum or change for a toll booth and larger molded pocket type compartments at the bottom for maps and such.
The small doors on the quad cab each have a small molded compartment just under the window as well.

The interior also has overhead flip down compartments for a radar detector and a pair of sun glasses. I like to use the sun glass compartment to hold insurance and registration information. It makes it easily accessible should I ever get stopped by a fine, upstanding member of our local police force. 

<b>The Exterior</b>

Overall, I do like the looks of the <b>Dodge Ram 1500 SLT</b>. I like the rounded styling of the Dodge over the squarer Chevy. I won't mention F-O-R-D, since doing so would require a donation to the dirty word jar and I'm out of quarters at the moment. Our truck has what I can only describe as a regular size bed. There are four tie downs, which solves our fur baby transportation problem. Since I refuse to let her ride in the back unprotected, the tie downs allow us to secure her kennel in the truck bed so she can travel safely without a lot of slipping and sliding around. The bed also has four little indents so you can compartment the bed off with a piece of wood. My dear, sweet, thoughtful husband had a two by 12 cut in half and trimmed to fit. Now, I don't have to grunt and groan while I struggle to lift two and a half gallon jugs of water over the side. I only have to put the tailgate down and they are still where I put them when I loaded the groceries.
The outside door handles are surrounded by plastic which is another plus. It measurably cuts down on any scratches that can be made when fumbling with packages while trying to get the key in the lock.

<b>Overall</b>

Okay, so it's grown on me. It's still not my minivan but it will do nicely until we do purchase one in the next 12-18 months. The <b>Dodge Ram 1500 SLT</b> has a nice relatively smooth and quiet ride. It is a truck so you won't find the ride as smooth and quiet as a lot of similarly priced sedans or even a minivan. As for my grocery problem, well, I leave the kids at home with their dad and go alone. A <i>BIG</i> plus!
