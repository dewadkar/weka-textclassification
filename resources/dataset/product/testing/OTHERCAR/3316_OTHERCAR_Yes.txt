                 When I turned 16 I looked to get a car to get me to and from school and so forth, I had always seen Volvos to be pretty good cars and this one was no different.  It's roomy, handles well, has a tiny turning radius, and has plenty of high-end power.  Not to mention the fact that the interior is extremely nice and comfortable.  So, needless to say, I bought the car it has 193,000 miles on it and the only major work was about $750 for replacement of a transmission mount, an oil system workout, and other minor repairs.
     Driving the Volvo is great, the 740 sedan is a great base with good characteristics and the wagon takes those and does little to alter them.  The Volvo won't win any drag races, but it accelerates well, has excellent handling (not on ice or water however)and relatively good cargo carrying capability and a great interior that is roomy and comfortable.

What I love:
*It's a Volvo, and I love Volvos
*It holds a lot
*It is amazingly easy to park (the wheels angle when the turn //  //)
*Very comfortable for any length of time

What I don't so much love:
*It wears the front tires quickly (if you rotate normally it's no problem)
*It CANNOT be driven in heavy rain or snow (the back wheels really want to be in front of everything else)
*The AC is kind of weak (it is a Swedish car)

     This car is excellent, and although I am a teenager, I wouldn't recommend it for teenagers.  It is a great car for college students, families or anybody who wants a used car that doesn't look like a car from the eighties and needs the carrying capacity it affords.<br><br>
