            Ever since I lived with my old roommate Aaron, I wanted to get a Jeep.  He was in love with them, and was somehow able to infect me with his love of this rough and tumble vehicle.  So earlier this year (April to be exact) I bought a '97 Wrangler.  Ohhhh... it sure was purty (yes, I'm in the South) and the dang thing was awesome to take out in the woods, but the gas mileage was HORRIBLE!!!

I would spend hours on end washing and waxing and polishing and detailing this vehicle.  There was not another Jeep in Tallahassee that was as pretty as mine.  My first road trip was what began the slow process of me hating my Jeep.

My friends and I loaded up to go to the Itchatucknee River in Gainsville - a trip that's about 2 hours normally.  It took us more than 3 and a half hours to get down there.  My Jeep was a 4 cylinder, which translates into not being able to go more than 70 miles an hour downhill.  Uphill, you're lucky to get to 60 mph.  If we turned the air on, my gas mileage dropped to below 10 mpg.  

I started noticing that my gas mileage was really bad in town too, but I was so blinded by the fact that I was in love with my Jeep that I ignored this for a while.  Finally, I did a bit of research.  '97 is not a good year for the Wrangler.  Not only did Jeep decide to go back to the old CJ body style, with the round headlights (I was so happy about the body style revision), but the also changed the engine mounts and a fwe other things.  I was saddened when I sold my Jeep, but happy when I bought an old '86 CJ7 and a '93 Wrangler for what I got my '97 for.

All in all, my '97 was a good vehicle.  It handled extremely well, was mostly quiet (for a Jeep), and the top was very easy to get on and off.  The gas mileage was its only real downfall.  I would recommend this vehicle to someone who can afford the gas.
