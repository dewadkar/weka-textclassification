            I bought my 2001 VW Jetta 1.8T Wolfsburg about a week ago, and absolutely love it.  The look, feel and performance are equal (and in some cases greater) than more expensive German manufacturers; like BMW and Audi.  

<b> ENGINE </b>

The 1.8T engine is brilliant.  It is great for the family Dad (or Mom!) who commutes.  I drive about 40 miles a day, and wanted a sporty fun car to drive, but still able to throw my two kids in the back.  The engine is peppy and efficient.  The cars acceleration and handling is tight and clean.  The gas mileage is average (about 25 MPG for me) and you HAVE to run 92 octane or better.

<b> WOLFSBURG OR GLS? </b>

For anyone who is considering a 2001 Jetta, please take this into consideration.  If your dealership does NOT have a Wolfsburg Edition, WAIT and have them order one.  I know it might be hard if they have a regular 1.8T on the lot, but you will thank me!  The Wolfsburg is fantastic!  Just by LOOKING at it compared to the GLS, is night and day.  You get the upgraded 16" BBS limited edition wheels, which makes your little Jetta look like a BMW 325i.  Along with the great wheels, you get a chic leather steering wheel, and leather trimmed shifter.  You also get a sport suspension, which handles a lot "firmer" than the GLS.  The seats are also a bit different.  They are sportier and very European. And at only a few hundred dollars more it is an absolute steal!

<b> FINANCING </b>

I also financed through VW, and opted for the extended 6yr/100k bumper-to-bumper warrantee.  It only cost about four dollars more, and put me at ease.  Something to consider.  

<b> OPTIONS </b>

The only option that I got other than what was standard was the sunroof, which I love!  The monsoon sound system, to me, wasn't necessary; because I love to hear the engine and the turbo kick in!  I'm still a kid at heart and it sounds like a little jet engine taking off!  :)  I did, however, want the cold weather package, but I would have had to wait 30+ days for it.  I was restless at it was!

<b> SIZE </b>

I would also like to mention one other thing. I am 6' 3" and almost 300 lbs.  Call me fat and I'll pop you good!  :) But, my choices in cars are well.. limited!  I have to fit and be comfortable!  The sport seating in the Wolfsburg fit well, and have a ton of legroom.  I sat in the backseat once, and that was a huge mistake, because I almost got stuck.. heheh.  

<b> OVERALL </b>

So far I love the car, and it is a great balance between performance, family, economy and luxury.  Sure I want a BMW or even an Audi, but I also want a payment that fits my budget.  Hope my Epinion helps!  Good luck!


<B> **** UPDATE #1 **** </B>

Wow!  My first update!  I just put 2,500 miles on my car, and will be periodically updating this for you.  After driving the car for about a month, here are some more thoughts about the vee-dub.  I love it!  After a month of use, I couldn't be happier.  

I did notice ONE thing that was very obvious.  After I broke about 1,200 miles, the car ran even BETTER than it did prior!  Hard to believe, but the acceleration was speedier, and the engine was even quieter!  I am still thrilled with the car after a month, and still enjoy getting it and look forward to driving it.  

Consider this update as a "one month test drive".  I get tons of looks and compliments on it, and everyone wants to drive it.  There are a few things that did happen that you should be aware of.  The first being that I had what seemed to be some "road tar" along the sides of the car.  I cleaned the tar daily, and eventually took it to the dealer.  Basically, this was residue from the "shipping tape".  Once they cleaned it with a special product, it has been fine.  

On a side note about keeping the car clean.  The dash gets dirty very quick.  And is near IMPOSSIBLE to clean.  You will get small little white specks everywhere and it drives you nuts!  Don�t dare try a rag, or paper towel, because it will make it worse.  I recommend going to Walmart/Target and getting a "California Duster".  It's a little duster that you never have to wash or clean.  It cleans the dash in one small swipe, and also I clean my car daily to get the dust and pollen off of it.

So far the car is a sure winner!  Hope to write again in a few months!  GO TEST DRIVE A JETTA! :)

<B> **** UPDATE #2 **** </B>

Well, I have pulled 8,000 miles on my Wolfie.  My car is well worn in now.  You really no when a car is worn in when you see old french fries lying on the floor.

At 5,000 miles I had my car serviced.  If you are unaware, Volkswagen requires your car to be serviced every 5,000 miles until you hit 25,000 miles.  This is a free service, and they did all of the basics.

My car still runs perfectly.  Acceleration is still smoother than silk, and still catches everyone�s eye.  I have, however, noticed a few glitches along the way.  At highway speeds, I notice a good bit of road/car noise.  While, it is bothersome at times, I expect it to a degree.  Believe it or not, my '97 Hyundai Sonata was much quieter on the road.

Another imperfection is the back speakers.  The Jetta comes equipped with an 8-speaker setup.  Two tweeters near the top of the window, two at your feet, and two in the back doors by the locks and two all the way in the back.  I notice with certain songs, my back two tweeters will crackle at weird intervals.  You would think it would occur when there is "bassy" music being played, but it is more noticeable on softer music.  Very weird.  At my 10,000 mile service, I will point it out.

Other than that, I am still very pleased with my purchase, and <i> still </i> recommend test-driving a Jetta.

On a final note.  I received word from my VW dealer, that they just released their 2002 Jettas.  If you are in the market for a Jetta, listen up.  For the same price as a base 1.8T Jetta, they upgraded it tremendously.  First they upgraded to the Wolfsburg standard 16" tires.  They also made a CD player STANDARD now!  But, the most impressive part was that they took the 150 HP 1.8T engine and tweaked another 30 HP out of it; bringing it to a respectable 180 HP.

So, if you are in the market for a German car under $20k, the new 2002 1.8T would be a serious bargain!  

I'll keep the updates coming, so check back again.
