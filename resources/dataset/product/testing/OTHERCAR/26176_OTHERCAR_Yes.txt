            I am 6'2&quot; and 250 pounds and I can not stand small cars. I got this vehicle because my sister went on a mission to Las Vegas, Nevada so I know drive a 96' Subaru Legacy. I happen to be a big person and I fit into this car nicely. It's the most comfortable car I have been in. It sits low to the ground and has good pick-up. The best parts about this car is the TCS and the great space on the inside. It has got a pretty good sound system and my family is a big advocate of the Subaru brand. I  also drove a 87' Subaru station wagon and it has 220,000 miles on it and still runs. It has not had any major problems with it. The Subaru cars are so good and they do not break down. When I buy my first car it is going to be a Subaru. The only bad thing about my Legacy is that if you get a lot of snow or go on a bumpy road, it sit's so low that can create a problem. <br><br>
