            I have been saving for a digital camera for over a year, so I didn't have to skimp on features. Usually, I find it hard to justify spending 600.00 on anything, especially a camera.
This camera, after trying it at Best Buy, had me sold! The LCD is crystal clear, and the camera has the feel of being well built. If this was a car, it would be a Mercedes. The mpeg movie mode is great, and you can set it at 2 different resolutions. The still picture mode has 1600 x 1200, and a few lower resolutions. The manual was very easy to understand with lots of pictures. I would recommend purchasing a 32 mb memory stick right away. Also, the options available for this camera are unbelievable! Many different lenses, tripods, chargers etc...  The camera comes with  a ac adaptor/charger, usb wires to transfer pictures to computer, and av wires to watch pictures on your TV. I am very happy with this camera, and would recommend it to anyone.
