                 Okay, even the Camaro suffered prestige back during the gas crunch, those of you old enough to remember the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties.  In 1982, Chevrolet even put a four cylinder in my favorite car.  When the body changed in '82, I have to admit I did not like it at first.  But now I love the body style.
     And I like the new body style even more.  The car looks even more sleek and fast than ever.  The comfort level is a little better, but don't buy this car if you normally drive a Cadillac.  This car is made for you to feel the road.  This is a sports car, not a luxury car.
     If you are looking to buy a sports car, when you compare price, quality, performance, and driveability, it is hard to beat a Camaro.  I have a 1991 Camaro that I bought new.  It has 143,000 miles on it and all I really have done to the car is drive it, change the oil, every 3,000, regular tune-up, and put an alternator on it.  
     I have to fully recommend this car to anyone looking to buy a sports car.  Classic american muscle is hard to beat, and the new Camaro is no exception-it may not be classic yet, but it will, because the production of the car will be stopped soon.  Yes, one of the last rear wheel drives will soon to be extinct-I guess I will have to buy a truck next.<br><br>
