            There's a niche in the sport-ute market that Nissan hopes to tap with its new Xterra, a reasonably priced, midsize sport ute with rugged good looks matching its rugged capability. A bonus is all the extra stuff you can buy to tailor the Xterra for outdoor activities. 

Talk to any price-conscious sport-utility buyer and you'll hear how expensive the new SUVs are. So many, it seems, are priced well into the $20,000s, unless you compromise and look at smaller SUVs like the Toyota RAV-4 and Kia Sportage. 

Officials at Nissan North America Inc. remember earlier days, when their Nissan Pathfinder was something of a no-nonsense, rugged SUV with a much lower price than its starting $26,000-plus price tag today. 

So, they decided, why not build a new, affordable, 4-door, midsize SUV that doesn't force buyers to trade off size and roominess against style and true, off-road capability? 

For young active guys
The answer is the 2000 Xterra, a new, 5-passenger model based on Nissan's Frontier pickup truck. It's aimed at young, active buyers�up to 70 percent men�who want an SUV with a rugged look and cargo room for their outdoor and sports activities. 

&quot;Our advertisements will be for lifestyle, active individuals,&quot; said Andrew Polsinelli, model line planner for Xterra. The new name, &quot;Xterra,&quot; conveys a connection to the Earth, terrain and adventure, Nissan said. 

Based on a Nissan truck
You get real feedback on the terrain you're covering in the Xterra. The test Xterra XE 4x4 felt a bit truckish in its ride as it bobbed up and down on some road bumps and swayed through fast curves. 

It's no accident. The Xterra, both 2- and 4-wheel-drive models, is built on the same platform and has the same wheelbase as Nissan's Frontier 4x4 pickup. It also has a truck-style ladder frame chassis. In fact, on the outside, the Xterra's front�including hood, bumper, front doors and headlights�are common to Frontier. 

&quot;There are very distinct differences between the Xterra ride experience and the Pathfinder ride experience,&quot; Polsinelli said. &quot; . . . The Pathfinder is a little more city-sophisticated, as we call it. The Xterra, these buyers will be able to hose it off (after weekend activities) and take it to work the next day.&quot; 

Real take-me-to-the-woods personality
Underneath, the Xterra's double-wishbone front suspension and solid rear axle with leaf springs in back are truck-like, too. With 15-inch wheels, they do the job in rugged off-road terrain. The Xterra grabs tenaciously on steep hills, and rutted areas are not only passable, they're managed easily. 

Four-wheel drive is part-time in the Xterra, requiring the driver to manually shift a gear lever inside the vehicle. There is a 4-wheel-drive low gear for really rough going. 

Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball and felt a bit sluggish in quick, slalom-like maneuvers. 

Four-cylinder and V6 power
While the base 4x2 Xterra comes with a 2.4-liter 143-horsepower four cylinder, all 4-wheel-drive Xterras come with the up-level, 3.3-liter single overhead cam 12-valve V6 that's in the larger, more expensive Nissan Pathfinder SUV. Horsepower is the same for both vehicles at 170 at 4800 revolutions per minute. Torque also is the same at 200 lb-ft at 2800 rpm. 

The test Xterra seemed to tap out quickly in torque, forcing me to go through the gears in the 5-speed manual to flail out of the vehicle the quickest power for highway entrance ramps. Once up to speed, though, the Xterra handled traffic well. 

Fuel economy isn't the best. Even with the manual transmission, estimates for a 4x4 Xterra are for just 16 miles per gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. 

Roomy interior
The Xterra sits at least 7.9 inches above the ground, for those off-road treks. Overall, its height of at least 69.4 inches�even without a roof rack�makes it one of the taller SUVs on the market�a characteristic I noted as strong winds buffeted the vehicle during the test drive. 

The tall profile provides good headroom in front and rear seat is raised some to accommodate riders who sit in theatre-type seating back there. 

The Xterra has competitive front legroom of 41.4 inches. Rear legroom of 32.8 inches, however, is overshadowed by the 35.9 inches in the Suzuki Grand Vitara and even the 33.9 inches in the RAV-4 four-door. 

The Xterra's cargo room beats both of the shorter-length competitors, though, with a maximum 65.6 cubic feet. 

Made for gear
&quot;We discovered a whole generation of young buyers who use their vehicles like they use a good piece of sports equipment,&quot; said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International Inc. &quot;And most SUVs today are either too expensive or lacking the basic utility to meet their needs.&quot; 

Thus, the Xterra offers novel packaging. After watching young people fashion their own sports and activity gear holders in their sedans, vans and trucks, Nissan decided to make the Xterra a veritable lifestyle gear stower. 

An optional utility package adds a beefy, aluminum, tubular roof rack that includes a removable basket up front capable of holding up to 30 pounds of wet, dirty gear. The basket even has side cutouts so water from wet suits or snow gear can run off the vehicle. 

In addition, the vehicle &quot;will do up to 90 miles an hour with a kayak on top,&quot; said Bruce Robinson of Nissan's marketing group. 

That beefy, silver-colored rack helps make the Xterra distinctive, and Nissan officials expect 90 percent of Xterras to be sold with it. It does, however, bump up the starting price of the vehicle by some $1,000. 

Interior bike rack, too
Inside the cargo area, the utility package adds six ceiling tie clips to the traditional floor hooks so items can be secured in various ways. The ceiling clips also work with an accessory bike carrier, with an estimated retail price of about $200, that keeps bikes secure inside the vehicle, rather than outside on the tailgate. 

&quot;The fun in this vehicle lives in the details,&quot; Hirshberg said. &quot;It's literally designed to be a toolbox to help its owners attack their active lifestyles.&quot; 

Wide appeal
Nissan looks to sell between 50,000 and 60,000 Xterras a year. Half of the Xterras sold are expected to be 2-wheel-drive models, with many of them in the Sunbelt, an area that &quot;few manufacturers tap real well,&quot; according Polsinelli. 

&quot;It will be a magnet for the brand,&quot; he predicted. &quot;This is more SUV than you can buy . . . when compared with others in the price range.&quot; 

Example: The Xterra's starting manufacturer's suggested retail price plus destination charge of just under $18,000 for an XE model with 2-wheel drive and manual transmission is just $1,000 more than the smaller-sized 1999 Toyota RAV-4 4-door 4x2 with manual transmission. And it's nearly identical to the starting MSRP of a 1999 Jeep Cherokee, which has older, boxier styling. <br><br>
