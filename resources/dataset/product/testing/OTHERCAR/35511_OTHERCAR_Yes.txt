            On a cold winter morning my 1999 Honda Odyssey did not start. Found immediately the problem, loose contact on battery,  and was able to jump-start the van without problem ... except, the check-engine-light stayed on. As there was no explanation in the manual how to reset this indicator after the battery had been disconnected, I ask a Honda Service to reset the light. Now starts my negative experience, a true Odyssey (in Homer's original meaning, not Honda's):  Invoice $ 79 to reset the light. When I wasn't happy about this about (about the price of 2 new batteries!!! just to reset the light)  I was told that by design it is necessary to run a complete computer check to find out how to reset the light. I was able to get the invoice down to $49 + tax, which I think, is till an exorbitant price to reset an indicator light (which, one might think, should reset itself after cleaning and re-connecting the car battery contact).  

Another item: When you try to change the third brake light's light bulb, there's a fair chance you break the minute cover of the mounting screw. Of course Honda won't sell you the tiny cover (about the size of a Penny) but the complete brake light for $30+ (Don't remember exact price)

R�sum�: When you intend to buy a Honda Odyssey consider possible extreme high service costs for minor items.
