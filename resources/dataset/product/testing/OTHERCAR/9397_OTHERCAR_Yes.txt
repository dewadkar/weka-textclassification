            I have always been a fan of German-engineered cars, and also of getting good value for my money, so when I started looking for a new car one of the first places I looked was Volkswagen.  I went in with the expectation of finding pricing and value comparable to the other models I was considering, but what I found was so much more!  I was immediately struck by the Jetta's styling (including the cool purple and red dash lights!), and the attention to detail in the interior.  I was equally surprised by the variety of options that were included in the base price of the vehicle, such as the remote keyless entry and alarm system. This was only the most basic model I was considering!  The test drive only served to confirm my growing belief that this was the car I had been searching for. The car handled beautifully!  Very quick and responsive, with an upgrade in torque from the previous year, as well as larger tires, giving it a smoother, more solid ride.  To top it off, the price was well under $20,000, making it the best value for the money as well.  
Over the period that I have owned my Jetta, I have run across a few small design flaws.  The cup holders in the back seat are very flimsy, and one side broke loose after only a few uses.  Also, the seat back recliner, rather than being a lever, is a dial that you have to turn FOREVER to get the seat reclined to any real degree.  I consider these to be very minor, considering the wide variety of things that do work very well.  Also, I had a great deal of trouble getting in to the service department for my first oil change/maintenance visit, but that is an issue with the dealership, not the vehicle.  The sales process, on the other hand, was a breeze!  Volkswagen even gives a follow-up call to verify that you were completely satisfied with your experience.  Overall, I have to say that my experience with Volkswagen, and the product itself have both been excellent!<br><br>
