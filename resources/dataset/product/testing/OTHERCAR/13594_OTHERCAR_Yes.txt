            I had a 1991 Miata for over a year and fell in love with it.  Honestly it is the closest thing to driving a go-cart, and fairly close to the feel of riding a motorcycle.  The Miata is the closest car to having a perfect 50/50 ratio in weight, and close to 100% of possible value in enjoyment.  Even though this car seems like it would be very poor to drive in the winter(I owned one through a fairly bad New England winter as my only car), it had predictable performance in the snow with the small expense of rear snow tires.  With the combination of proven gas mileage averages in the high 20s, and the flow of open wind in your hair, I would recommend it to anyone with the ability of owning a two seater with limited storage room.  The only thing I do not recommend with this car is stiffening the suspension or adding a rollbar(like I did) if the car is taking long trips, it does rob some of the smoothness of the ride.<br><br>
