            Well yesterday I bid farewell to my 1994 Eagle Vision TSI. The only way to describe my feelings about this car is to say it was the classic love - hate relationship.

When I purchased this car back in 1994 it was may first new AMERICAN auto. Up to that point I had always owned import cars, but I figured lets give a chance to an American auto maker for a change. For the first 35,000 miles this car ran great. I loved the handling, power and all the room this car offered. Then the roof started to cave in. It all started with the cooling and air conditioner going then in no particular order all of the following either broke down or needed to be replaced: transmission, cooling system again, power antenna, cd tape player, front control arms, rear control arms, AC again, gas gauge and more recall notices than I care to count. All of these problems happened after the warranty had expired. Between 90,000 and 104,000 miles the care ran great again. I thought I was finally over the hump. Then came the bad news, I needed another new rear control arm (I don't think so).

So now she's gone off to a far better place as a trade-in at a local Nissan dealership where I just purchased a new 2000 Maxima SE.

Buy American? I don't think so.
