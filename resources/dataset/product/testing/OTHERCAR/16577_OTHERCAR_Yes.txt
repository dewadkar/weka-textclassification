            I bought this vehicle because I thought it was more practical than the little Z roadster.  I enjoy this car's handling, speed, and size.  It is sleek and low to the ground.  The interior is nice leather, you do not use Armor-All on this leather.  BMW has a special cleaning kit,for 20.00 you get cleaner, conditioner, and a cleaning mist. It has automatic sensors on the hood that automatically adjusts the regulator.  For instance, if you have it set on 70, and the inside temp is 70, under cloudy conditions, and then you hit a sunny area where the outside temperature is all of the sudden hotter, it automatically reads the temp difference, and cranks up the air. There is a button that you hit to circulate only the cabin air in case you hit a part of road with bad breathing conditions.  The seats in the back fold down so you can practically fit anything in there, as long as it's not too tall, for example, I brought home an 8 foot ladder the other day, just a small portion hung out of the back maybe four or five inches.  There are air bags driver and passenger.  It has autosensors to tell you if you're oil is due for a change.  It cruises at high speeds very quietly.
Suspension is great, the parts are easy to change, like a fuse or whatever, I who have never done this, got out my little handbook, and easily followed their instructions to change a fuse!  This is not a car for a teenager, it goes too fast.  I don't like about this vehicle, the cup holders are a wierd size.  I drove it from Texas to Manhatten and back this summer.
