            I researched and test drove minivans and SUVs for 2 months before choosing the XL-7.  The XL-7 definitely came out on top for fun, function, safety features and price.  I chose the LTD model, because the dealership had a demo with 2700 miles for a great price, plus I haven't owned leather since my 1974 BMW 2002.  The options are unbelievable for this price car... moonroof, front/rear air, CD/cassette/radio, daytime running lights, running boards, real spare tire, and great quality leather seats.  The ride is exciting.  The handling is exceptional.  The gas mileage is 17+ in town, 20-22 mpg on highway.  

This is a real, although somewhat luxurious (except for easily scratching plastic interior parts) SUV...not a fake one built on a car platform with an SUV body.  Suzuki's been in this market for a long time, and my mechanic (who owns a 1991 Suzuki) likes them.  One caveat... when the 36,000 mi. bumper to bumper and 7-year 100,000 powertrain fully transferable warranties run out, parts are generally more expensive than Honda and Toyota.

I drive carpool in the a.m. with 4, soon to be 5, elementary schoolers, and the somewhat compact space (that would cramp adults) is just fine for them.  They also can work the seat independently to exit and enter.  Four adults can sit very comfortably in this car, though.  All rear seating folds down and can provide plenty of cargo room.  My wife likes all the drink holders.  Crash tests are better in several aspects than BMW, Mercedes, and Nissan.  All-in-all, a great vehicle.  The 2003s have slightly higher quality interior.
