            I purchased my Pontiac Sunbird in May of 99, on a whim, just as a fun car to have because I was tired of driving my Jeep which didn't have air conditioning.  It had had 7 *gasp* previous owners, and had 103,000 miles, but was in pretty good shape.  I figured for $3000, I'll get me just a little car for some summer road trips.  

Well, it did serve me well.  We put about 5,000 miles on it last summer.  It got FANTASTIC gas mileage (hovering around 30 miles per gallon).  We had no problems with it, but had to get a CD player because only having a radio just wasn't cutting it.  Of course, two months into ownership, the timing belt broke.  But, that happens to any car.

Well, in December of 99, problems started to hit.  The car kept mysteriously overheating.  We tried everything; tried sealing the radiator, but it wasn't leaking.  We tried oil changes, checks of the coolant system, everything.  When we finally took it into the shop, we discovered that it had CRACKS IN BETWEEN EVERY CYLINDER IN THE BLOCK!!!
Cracks so big you could stick a screwdriver head in each crack. Apparently, every Sunbird with over 100,000 miles that this shop sees has this same problem.  The flimsy aluminum engine just breaks down after that many miles.  Strange was, the last day it broke down we were on the interstate.  We pulled off at an off-ramp to park to analyze the problem.  When we did, we could see THREE other Sunbirds broken down and abandoned within our view.  It was like a Sunbird graveyard.  Eerie.

So, $1000 and a new engine block later, I was back in it.  Everything was going great for months until one day I was driving down that same stretch of interstate when this horrible CLANK came from my engine; smoke flew into the car, sulphur smells, oil pressure dropped to zero.  I pulled over, and that was the end.  Without warning, a rod had been thrown right through the block and out the front of the car. Ouch.  Well, since the time I had had that car, it had been very well maintained.  Now it's in a junkyard, waiting for someone to salvage it.  It's a shame - it was a fun car; I got lots of usage out of it.  I miss the gas mileage.  But a warning, Sunbirds are notorious for breaking down in a BIG, SEVERE way after about 100,000 miles - so get those engines checked for cracks in between the cylinders, and be careful what you buy!<br><br>
