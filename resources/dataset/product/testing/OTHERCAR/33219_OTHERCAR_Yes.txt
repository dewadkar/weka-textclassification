            Being that my Honda was purchased in 1997 may not make me &quot;current&quot; as far as reviews go, but I just had to add my two cents here.

We purchased the four door V6 model and love it!

Here is a list of the features I (we) love the best:

Economical on gas (a plus for anyone!)
Extremely quiet on the inside (I could be driving next to a eighteen wheeler and hardly hear it!)
Comfortable (the seats have two controls that makes driving a pleasure!)
Child safety locks (standard!)
Easy handling (this car practically drives itself!)
Low Maintenance (no problems as of yet!)
Safety...the most important thing, and this car ranks right up at the top by Consumer Reports!

So, if your family is in the market for an excellent car that will stand the test of time and will make driving a pleasure...the Honda Accord is for you! <br><br>
