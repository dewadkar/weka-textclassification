            I leased this vehicle as my 94 Legend lease expired. Unfortunately Acura put me and many others in a position of either moving up to the $41,000 RL, or moving down to the piece of junk original TL.

While I am pleased with the RL's capabilities, my impressions of it in '97 was that it was too much money for the car. It's a nice car, but at that time, not that much improved over the '96 Legend, and therefore not worth the $5,000 - $7,000 price increase.

Today, 3 years later the RL is now experiencing transmission problems, which I understand from other auto web sites and the dealer service dept, is not uncommon for this model year. I do understand that the 2000's are much improved.

I must say the vehicle is very well engineered from a human interaction perspective. The drive, and cabin are superb. I suspect a new one is quite good, but again, the pricing is out of line. This is a $35-40K car not a $40-45K car. <br><br>
