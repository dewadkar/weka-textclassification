            Finally took delivery of my X5 December 1999 after being on the wait list for 4 months. And I am glad I waited to get the X5 vs another SUV. The X5 is everything it is marketed to be! A super class SAV for the active life style. Yes, I got the X5 because of the BMW name, but also because of the workmanship and quality of the vehicle.

Please note: I am reviewing the GPS along with the technology in the car b/c it's a given that BMW produces high quality performance vehicles. So I'm focusing on the features I care most about. Other reviews should suffice in the area of the vehicle itself.

I got my X5 loaded with the activity package along with the GPS on board computer system. I was impressed with the technology when I first took delivery of the X5. However, since then I have experienced other GPS systems in the Acura as well as the Mercedes. And I have concluded the BMW GPS is lacking significantly! The UI (user interface) is cumbersome and slow. It runs off a CD located in the trunk and provides round about ways to get to your destination. I've downloaded directions from MapQuest as well as Yahoo and it's comparable. I have suggested to BMW to upgrade the on board computer for the next release of the X5 to a DVD system which is currently available in the Acuras. I was blown away at the touch screen and faster system. Also, it contained more restaurants, golf course, sporting venues, and service needs than the BMW GPS.

It's been 14 months and 10k miles since I've had the X5. I've brought the car in for service about 5x for system failure on the on board computer system along with the eletrical failure that was draining the battery. As you can expect from BMW service, they were efficient and provided a loaner car for the day. TOP SERVICE!!!

Overall, I'm very pleased with the X5. I've already requested to be on the waiting list for the MX5, the M version of the X5, later in 2002. However, I could change my mind if the on board computer system is not improved.
