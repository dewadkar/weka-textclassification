            Bought new in 97', have logged 93K+ miles - some cross-country - some off road in chassis deep glutinous MUDD.  

This one is my everyday ride.  Cleans up nicely, decent highway manners, is on it's best pavement behavior at 50mph and under.  Gas mileage sucks unless you own or are heavily invested in an oil company.

Most repairs I have made myself - nothing major.  Soft-top will have to be replaced often.  I am on my third - will purchase my fourth this spring.  Be watchful of window studs - will rust in place and are a bear to remove.  Recommend stainless steel studs.  Lightly lube every 60-90 days as well as gaskets between window frame and door top.  If not, be prepared to loose some paint.

Striking good looks and definitely one of a kind.  In some regions of the country (this one) have gone for months and not seen another Defender.  When you do, it's all "thumbs-up" and smiles.

If you are a single woman, this is the truck to have - the D90 is a serious guy magnet.  Sucks for me; women stare quizzically, men leave their women to come over and talk truck and take a look under the hood.  

Bottom line, if you missed the boat in 97' and you're willing to spend the cash and you're willing to spend your kid's inheritance on gas and maintenance - go for it.  

Rumor mill says Defenders will reappear on our shores in 2006.  Ford owns Land Rover now; hopefully the D90 will remain true to form and not turned into another of the long line of vaginized mass-produced Expe-trucks.
