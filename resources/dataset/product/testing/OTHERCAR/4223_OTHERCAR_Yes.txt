            I've been a Caddy owner for over 20 years and never had a real problem with them until I got the &quot;Northstar&quot; engine in my 1994 Sedan Deville. At approximately 60000 miles I got a service engine soon light and took it to the dealer. I was told the oil pan gasket had to be replaced. Now on a regular auto replacing the oil plan gasket is a $100 job. On the Northstar the entire engine has to be pulled out of the car and the engine dismantled. Total cost: $2200.00  At approximately 72000 miles I got a service soon signal when the car seemed to drop out of gear. When to the dealer and was told the computer cable assembly between the &quot;Northstar&quot; engine and the tranmission had gone bad.  The entire transmission had to be pulled and the assembly replaced. Total cost: $1900.00. I've now spent on these two things over $4100 on an automobile that is supposed to go 100,000 before it needs regular maintainence. I call Cadillac about both problems and really got the run around from them. They would not give me a phone number to call them back at since they are on some type of &quot;rotary&quot; system. Could never talk to the same person about the problems. In the past Cadillac had been helpful when I had a transmission problem on a 1986 I had they paid half the repair cost even though the car had been out of warranty for 8500 miles. Anyway Im not big on this &quot;Northstar&quot; engine. Seems more problems with 2000 Northstar from what I hear and see on this board.<br><br>
