            The 1999 Chrysler LHS is a true head turner.  From the large stylish exterior to the spacious interior this car is true luxury at an affordable price.  There are very little extras in the LHS except maybe the optional 17 inch chrome wheels and a full size spare in the trunk.  

The all leather interior is soft and the heated seats are a plus in the winter.  All the gauges are laid out in an easy to read fashion and the center clock is a nice touch to the luxury cars of the past.  Heat and air-conditioning are more than enough to keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The LHS handles well for its size.  Although the extra length in the car makes high speed turns a little unstable.  However, this car was born to run.  The 253 hp 3.5 engine revs up smoothly and without hesitation.  On the highway the suspension absorbs all the bumps and makes the car feel as if its floating on air.  Lets not forget the stereo system.  Lots of power to listen to the radio, CDs or a tape. The only complaint that I have is that there are no radio controls on the steering wheel.  This would be a great advantage to have for channel surfing.

All in all, the Chrysler LHS isn't for everyone.  The size of the car is rather large but if you like space, this car has it.  Plenty of room in the interior and the trunk reminds me of the cars of the 50s.  The beautiful styling turns heads of all ages.  <br><br>
