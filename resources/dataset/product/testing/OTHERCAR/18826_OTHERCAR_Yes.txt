            I have bought my 1991 Mitsubishi Precis 5 speeds in 1996 with 90,000 miles and now it has more than 187,000. This car took me everywhere, from Georgia to Texas and Mexico back and forth. So I pushed it very badly but it is still doing fine. Of course I had to change some parts like the oil pan and the top oil gasket over the head of the engine but these are pretty normal stuff after almost 200K miles. The only BIG problem I had it was a bad heat sensor that on summer used to stop the car when the outside temperature was about 90F. During the night no problem. Several mechanics checked the car but nobody realized what the real problem was. After a while I decided to take it to a Mitsubishi dealer and they found the problem right away. This cost me more than 500$. After this event happened in 1997 the car always performed fine. The engine is a 1.5L/4-Cylinders with electronic injection. It is pretty compact and you really do bunch of miles with a few bucks of gas. At 60 mph it does about 3000 rpm. If you change the oil regularly and take care of the filters the car will perform great and will rarely give you problems. The seats are not the best (a little bit too hard for my standards) but for a city use they are comfortable.
I enjoy driving my little Precis. I became fond of it because it took me everywhere and gave me very little problems.<br><br>
