             Well, all I can say is I found that all those Brooklyn discount camera sites are not created equal. I have been researching to death which camera I wanted to buy and after a lot of reading decided on the canon G2. I remember reading about those Brooklyn camera discount sites and to stay away from them, so I ordered my camera, $849, from a more, supposedly, reputable recommended site. When I went to check on shipping status 2 days later I was told that the salesman made a mistake and that the camera was not in stock. I told them to cancel the order and e mail me the cancellation confirmation. To add insult to injury when they finally e mailed me a cancellation confirmation it came through with a virus in the e mail. Reluctantly I went to one of those Brooklyn sites I was warned against. I called by phone and asked the first and foremost questions on my mind "are these gray goods" the answer was a positive "no." I guess the tone of my voice must have indicated that I was an apprehensive buyer and the salesman must have picked this up and very nicely put my mind at ease, he said "we don't sell canon g2 gray goods they all come with American warranties and factory sealed boxes just the way any large retailer would get them. I have talked to others where the flash cards were missing and you had to pay extra for them, battery was extra, etc., etc. US1 Digital assured me that all the items that come with the camera from Canon is what I would get. Well, after receiving the camera I was more thrilled than ever over it's pictures, they are better than 35 MM film. As for the site I bought it from, US1 digital, I can't say too much. I needed some more things and went back to the site. Well, I now saw the canon g2 for $699, $35 less than I paid for it from the same source. I called them and with no hassles I was issued a credit for the $35. Not only were their prices the best but the salespeople were extremely well informed about the product. There knowledge really impressed me because most of those places only know product numbers and their attitude is "do you want it or not." At US 1 digital it was quite the opposite and they never tried pushing extended warranties or any other pressure tactics. I certainly would buy from them again and by the way this is (and I have it in my possession) not a gray goods piece all American warranties in the brand new sealed box, with everything that other stores are selling for close to $1000 for. I appreciate this forum and all the good advice I get so I am passing on what I feel is a great source for your camera needs, one that tells you the truth about stock condition and ships the same day. I didn't pay extra and got my camera the next day (but I do live near New York City) Good luck to all and I cannot say too much about my Canon G2.
