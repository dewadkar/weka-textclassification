            Since I do a lot of Web work, the digital camera I bought did not have to be the highest end model.  I don't print my pictures - I e-mail them and put them on web pages.  And for that use, the Olympus D 340-R is perfect.  It's compact and easy to carry around, so a great travel camera.  It's inexpensive, so a great way to start out in the Digital arena to see if you like it.  It comes with decent software for optimizing your pictures and adding effects (softening, red-eye reduction, etc.)  Since I bought the Flashpath Adapter, downloading my pictures is a snap (just don't format your Flashpath Adapter with the memory card inside it - bye bye vacation pics!)  Almost everywhere I go, people are entranced by this little camera, so it has also been a great conversation piece!  I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to explore digital photography - the D 340R is a great place to start.<br>
