                 I bought 2 of these cameras at Best Buy for $99 each the day after Thanksgiving. 

     One is for me and one is for a friend. This is my second "nice" digital camera and it is great! I have another small digital camera I got for free with a computer purchase and a pen cam, which is really small and actually a lot of fun to play with. However, neither of those cameras could provide me with the kind and quality pictures I wanted.

     This Kodak camera is easy and simple to use. I chose not to buy the docking station for myself, but bought it as a gift for a friend. Don't let anyone tell you that you MUST have to docking station! It is a lie!

Transferring the Pictures and Using the Software

     I use the USB adapter that plugs right into the camera. It is fast and really easy. After the software is installed, just connect the camera and turn it on. It asks how you want to transfer the pictures and if you would like to erase the memory after you transfer them to your computer. You can also give the pictures a naming scheme instead of just numbers. 

     My "other" digital camera is in closet because of its naming convention. Every time I took off the old pictures and put on the new, the same number would start over again at 000001 along with having the same folder name. I had to be so careful not to write over the other pictures, and I just didn't have time to rename all 300 pictures.

   With the Kodak software however, I can choose the naming scheme while the software worries about the picture numbers. I can name them something as simple a Picture01, Picture02 ...and so on, or I could name it something like DisneyTripDay1-01, DisneyTripDay1-02, and so on.  This is nice because you will never have to worry about writing over a picture accidentally. You can also tell the software to name them by date.  It is very simple for anyone to use, but it also has those "tweaks" that a more advanced user might like. It's definitely something the whole family can participate in.

   Another nice feature of the software is the "Auto Protect" that you can switch on or off. This feature will prevent anyone from writing over that file. It cannot be deleted, or messed up in any way. If you want to modify it, you can, but it will force you to name it differently.

    At first I found it a little annoying because I was in the process of editing all my photos. I was doing a lot of cropping, and I later realized I left out some good parts of the pictures. Thank goodness I still had the original. Parents can keep this feature on all the time, so there is no way a friend or little family member can delete pictures. But again, an advanced user can easily turn many of the features on and off at their convenience.

     The software that comes with it makes it easy to fix photos automatically. You can even email the pictures with the click of a button. Everything that most people want to do is built right into the software. Once you have the photos on the computer, all you have to do is check a little box next to each picture that you want to email. After that, you press the Email Tab and you out in a subject, a few lines of text if you want, and fill out the To and From fields. You don't have to open another email program and then try to attach the photos, and worry about if you did it right or not.


The Camera Itself - Why I think it&#146s cool.

     The camera has a built in orientation sensor. It can be turned off via the menu, but it is a great little feature. When you get the pictures on your computer, they will automatically be in the correct orientation. You never have to rotate your pictures to make the right way! The camera already knows! 

I did not purchase the docking station for myself because I already have and use rechargeable batteries. However, with the dock, you do not need extra batteries because the dock will also charge the batteries while the camera is on it. It also makes the photos transfer by the "touch of a button," but the USB adapter is really simple to use, and to make it transfer, all you have to do it plug it in, turn the camera on, and click transfer when the screen pops up. Personally, that's easy enough for me to not buy the docking station for another $100. But if you want it, then using this camera will be very similar to the Kodak commercial. Even without the dock, I could take a few pictures, plug the camera to the USB, transfer, auto fix, and even start to print in less than 60 seconds. If that's not easy, I don't know what is.

I already have a compact flash card reader and cards, so I decided not to buy any SD cards. Secure Digital (SD) is the type of card you can use in this camera to add more memory for more pictures. You can always buy more memory later and probably cheaper at a later time.

However, you can take about 72 great pictures with the 16 MG internal memory if the quality is set to &#147good&#148.   If you set the quality to &#147better,&#148 you can get about 34 pictures, and set at &#147best&#148 will get you 17 pictures of such high detail that they are perfect from printing out 8 by 10 photos.   Unless you plan to print all of your pictures at that size, you really don&#146t need to spend the extra money at first on more memory.


The time and date stamp are really great for the pictures too. When you transfer the pictures to your computer, all of that information goes with it, and you can sort your pictures chronologically. 

The flash is set to Auto, but can be changed easily via the menu, or if you just want it off for a few pictures, there is a small circle button above the LCD screen with a lighting bolt arrow on it that will turn on the flash for 1 picture.

The other buttons on the back of the camera includes a &#147share&#148 button, which basically is like a book mark of a good photo that the software will remind you of when you transfer it. There is also a &#147delete&#148 button, a &#147review&#148 button, and a &#147menu&#148 button. There is a large circular button with 4 arrows on it pointing in all directions and &#147OK&#148 on the middle of the button.

This button is used to scan through all the options quickly. You can set the LCD screen to be on &#147Live View&#148 all the time, or to only come on to show you the picture for a few seconds so you can see if you like it.

The menu is available in English, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and I think Chinese, but it was in Chinese, so don&#146t quote me on that.


There is a 2x digital zoom built in, but I found it not to be convenient to use, since you have to do it through the menu. It is not as simple as pressing a button.

On the left side, there is also a small switch that says on, or off, and there is a little flower next to it. This is meant for taking close up pictures of 12&#148 or less. I took a bunch of pictures only 3 or 4 inches away. Sometimes, the flash messed it up, but if you had the proper lighting, you might be able to get some great shots up close.

The camera fits in my hand and its pretty light weight with all things considered. It is about 4 inches long, a little over an inch in width, and has a height of about 2 and a half inches.

The camera is turned on via a switch in the front, which uncovers the lens, very much like a conventional 35 mm would turn on.  The lens however, says it is &#14739; mm.&#148

The camera came with a wrist strap, but did not come with a bag. That is my one complaint.  I had an old bag lying around, but it doesn&#146t fit well.

The nice thing is, when I opened the box, I put in the FREE batteries in the box, and I was off running around taking pictures. Once you get the packaging off, you can be taking pictures within a minute or two, it&#146s that simple. The camera also has some nice features such as exposure compensation, but most people won&#146t use this feature.


I would definitely recommend this camera for anyone looking to take pictures and share them with friends and family. It is not easy enough to give to a 5 year old to use, but not good enough for a photography student.

However, as long as you aren&#146t trying to do anything fancy, even a 5 year old can look at the LCD screen and click the button to take a picture.  This camera would be great for families and people looking to carry a camera around with them. For the price, I carry it around in my purse and would take it almost anywhere and get great pictures from it to boot.

The batteries are used up fast if you keep the LCD screen on, but can probably take over 100 pictures even while using it before needing to replace them.
 *2 AA and the owner's manual recommends Kodak brand batteries. I wonder why? :)*

Bottom line: This is a great little camera and a good price for a 2.0 mega pixel camera.


*New Info*
Someone left me a pointless comment about how he didn't like the camera for close up pictures. Because of that, he said my review was off topic. 

In my opnion, the close up pictures are pretty good. But, you should see for yourself. I don't know if this is ok to do, but I put 3 pictures that I took up close of my handwriting on my web page, and you are welcome to visit if you would like to.
