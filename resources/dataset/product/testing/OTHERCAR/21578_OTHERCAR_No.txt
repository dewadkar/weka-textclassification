            After countless and expensive repairs on our Dodge Caravan, we were desperate for a better car. So after much searching we purchased a Dodge Intrepid. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say, and why we bought another Dodge after the first two is beyond me now.

This Intrepid is roomy, and comfortable and when it's running it runs like a dream. It's powerful, quiet, a perfect family car...for a family with lots of money to throw down the drain.

It's famous for it's transmission problems (I wish I had known this BEFORE I bought it). And countless other &quot;smaller&quot; things fall apart and need repaired constantly. These things add up. Instead of being better off financially and feeling safer in my reliable car, I am scared I will be stranded in the cold on my way to my son's preschool.

We don't recommend this car to anyone. We are buying a NEW car (bought this one used) and it's going to be a HONDA, period. With a big fat extended warranty.

Happy Car Hunting and if you see one of these keep right on walking!<br><br>
