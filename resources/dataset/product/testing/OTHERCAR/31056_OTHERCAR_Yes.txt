            <b>Preamble</b>
For years I have been driving a clapped out Ford Falcon station wagon, its only virtue being that on the road everyone gets out of my way.  Each time I touched it something else dropped off or broke, and whenever the temperature climbed slightly, it would refuse to start.  Prior to the Ford, I had a Holden Commodore, another disaster, so after this experience I swore never again to buy an Australian-made car, especially when Japanese vehicles had a such a good reputation...

When I was paid out from my permanent job last year, I found myself in a position to buy another car, and after a few months of research, some advice from the RAC (Royal Auto Club), our mechanic and various others, I opted for a Toyota Echo.  Because these cars hold their value so well (a) there were few of them on the second-hand market and (b) those that were available were almost as expensive as new models.  Thus, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the first new car of my life - an awesome experience!

(Not being a car expert, my assessment will be a basic one, with any technical terms being 'borrowed' from rac.com.au and/or from the Toyota Echo manual.)

<b>My Echo Experience</b>
Essentially, I didn't care if it had a you-beaut stereo system (after 15 years of no radio, one gets used to driving in silence!) or any of the other bells and whistles that abound in late model cars.  What I <i>did</i> want, however, was a car as follows:

(a) affordable
(b) economical on petrol
(c) well-made and reliable
(d) comfortable, with sufficient head-room for taller people
(e) air conditioned 

So, how does the Echo shape up?

Affordable?  Well, I paid $16,500 Australian (which included an extra thousand for extended warranty of three years).  At the current exchange rate, this converts to USD12,500.

Economical?  The tank holds 45 litres and the car seems to run forever before we fill it up again.  (Once I have done an assessment of km/litre I shall update this review.)

Well-made and reliable?  I'll have to update this review in six or twelve months' time, since I've only had the car since early December 2003.

Comfortable?  Both my husband and I find the seats comfy, with good lumbar support.  We have yet to do a long trip in it and there again I'll update on that score.  As for head-room and leg-room, there is ample for my husband who is around 6' and the driver's seat can be raised or lowered according to a person's height.

Airconditioned?  Yes, and very effectively so, with little vents that can direct the air where you want it to go, as well as a dashboard controlled dial that sends it to specific parts of the car:  feet, upper body, etc.

<b>Apart From the Essentials...</b>
The standard <b>warranty</b> is for three years, 100,000 km, with three years on paint and three on perforation corrosion.  By paying another $1,000, I have extended this to six years.

<b>Standard features</b> include:  driver's airbag, driver's seat belt pretensioner, front seat belt pretensioners, side door anti-intrusion beams, high mount rear stop lamp, immobiliser, split fold rear seats, rear wash/wipe and rear window demister, central locking system.

The upholstery and interior trim are well finished and of a pleasant design and colour.  The dashboard has a futuristic aspect with the viewing panel for speed, fuel, etc set at a slight angle to the steering wheel.  It takes a little getting used to, but all the numbers and icons are magnified so that every fluctuation in speed, revs, gas level, etc. is clearly visible.

There's plenty of storage space in the front for things like handbags and boxes of tissues, and little nooks and crannies where one can stow CDs and mobile phones.

The back seating, however, is a different story.  One is jammed into a fairly small area and would only want to travel like that for a short distance.  If you were giving someone a lift, for example, it wouldn't be a big deal.  Because there are only two of us and unlikely to be transporting others, it isn't a problem.

The boot (or trunk) is minuscule.  With the back seats in the upright position, one can fit the equivalent of two medium-sized Eskis in the rear of the vehicle.  When the seat back are lowered, this increases the stowage area, but as yet we haven't used the back of the car for this purpose.

The car can tow 700 kg but we don't intend using it in that way.

There is a powerful, four-speaker stereo system with an antenna located in the middle of the roof.  (I unscrewed it so I could cover the car and even without it, reception is still quite good.)

The motor is almost silent when you switch on the ignition, so much so it's hard to believe it's running.

Handling is a dream, the car being very responsive to the slightest touch of the steering wheel and executing a three-point turn in a narrow laneway is no big deal.  On the road, the pick-up from being stationary to beating everyone at the lights is surprisingly powerful, despite the little 1.3 litre engine and the fact that the transmission is manual.

<b>On The Downside</b>
The Echo in Australia has a different shape from that in the US:  it is more boxy at the back and the front dips away from the windscreen into apparent nothingness.  When you've been used to seeing the top of the bonnet (or the hood, as the Yanks say) and gauging distance with it, it's hard to work out just where you are when you're driving or parking.

Another issue is that having driven larger vehicles before, I am now all too aware of the lack of a buffer zone between me and another car in a crash situation.  It has also been said that to have the car repaired - cost of spare parts, etc. - is more expensive compared to others on the road.

Because of budget limitations, I couldn't afford the automatic version (which I would have preferred) and the five-door model - both were more expensive than the two-door manual hatch.  Also, the windows are not power-operated, which is another drawback.  The reason for this, the salesman told me, was that it would make the car too expensive.

<b>Conclusion</b>
We'll see how the car pans out over the next few months, and whether Toyota lives up to its reputation.  Any other observations will be duly noted in an updated review.

At this point in time:
What I love about this car:  Good maneuverability, power steering
What I hate about it:  Nothing, but I am concerned about being in a collision.
