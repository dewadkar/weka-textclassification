            The full size Jimmy is listed as its own model in GM's brochures, but since there is no listing for a full size Jimmy on E-pinions I'm adding my entry here. It shouldn't matter much anyhow, the trucks are basically the same, except a Jimmy's chassis is shorter and it only has two doors. 

The Jimmy and its Chevrolet brother the Blazer are much more popular among young people than the huge, family sized Suburban. Although the models suffer some confusion with the S-15 Jimmy and S-10 Blazer, these are not compact trucks. 1991 was the last year of the old overly square body style was begun in 1973 and these trucks are clearly pre oil embargo designs. They have the aerodynamics of a brick, carry 35 gallon fuel tanks and get between 10-15 miles to the gallon. 

While GM changed the body designs on their pick-ups in 1988 they left the bodies of the Jimmy and Suburban untouched until 1992. In my opinion, these last few years of that old classic design are the best looking and the most desirable. Although the sheet metal was not updated, mechanically these vehicles benefited from improved technology and were equipped with fuel injection. My truck had a 350 cubic inch V-8 and it ran very well. 

Mechanical problems with my truck were few and almost all were symptoms of its advancing age and mileage. It required a water pump at 110,000 miles and later a muffler and tail pipe. Although my truck was at stock height, one recurrent problem was universal joints. A GM mechanic told me this was a common problem caused by the angle of the drive lines. He also said regular grease jobs could delay these onset of trouble. 

My Jimmy was an SLE model and came equipped with all the power options and an automatic transmission. Body colors were two tone gray and it had a light gray crushed velour interior. I thought the cloth interior held up well, but I did not get it muddy or dirty so cannot attest how easy it is to keep clean.  Some of the interior trim, all stainless steel accents, came unstuck and had to be re-glued.

The truck also featured a removable fiberglass hard top and aluminum wheels with an internal spare. It was very attractive truck and often got compliments despite its advancing age. 

I used it in the snow extensively and found that it was very capable. When the four wheel drive was engaged, the truck would go almost anywhere. Also, I used it to pull trailers over the Cascade mountains on several occasions and never had any problems with overheating or lack of power. It was 100 percent truck and performance was excellent. 

The only negative comments I can make about this truck are in regards to its terrible fuel mileage. If money is important, this is a vehicle to avoid.  Unless you are wealthy, I wouldn't recommend using it as a commuter car. 

Currently, these trucks can be had used at bargain prices, but as they age, they are coming into the hands of younger people. Many are receiving hard use and abuse so buyers must beware. Great adult owned examples are still around and fetch only moderately higher prices. Still, as fuel prices continue to rise, you have to ask yourself if you need to own one. If you really like dinosaurs, it might be worth it.
