            I own a 1997, and 1993 Maxima plus a 1993 Altima. Not one of them has been to the dealer for repairs other than normal maintenance. The ride on my 1997 is better than is indicated in reviews I've seen. The only drawbacks on the 1997 car are that the seats are on the hard side and the steering doesn't give you the feel of the road that my 1993 Altima has. Reliability on all three cars is perfect. I just gave my son in Rhode Island the Altima to commute back and forth with. The cars are also solid. There are no rattles. The altima takes regular gas and gets respectable gas mileage, my 1997 Maxima takes High test, but also gets good gas mileage, about 20 MPG. If reliability is your main concern then Nissan is the car for you.<br><br>
