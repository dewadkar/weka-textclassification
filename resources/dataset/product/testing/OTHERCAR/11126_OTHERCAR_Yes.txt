            Lincoln, Mercury, and Caddy aside the Toyota family of Sedans is everything the average family needs. The camry is a smooth operator and the transmission changes gears without you even noticing. The leather seats are extremely comfortable and soft. It brakes well and is secure when corning around sharp turns a little too fast. 

The styling of the Camry is very "Toyota" because its not really standoutish and is very conservative in its design(a toyota trademark). The car gets good gas mileage and can hold up to five passenger comfortably. The dash looks somewhat odd, but after some getting used to its very functional and easy to use. The sound system in this car is very good when compared to other factory systems out there. The sound is clear and can easily be understood without the kinda muffled sound that can be found coming out of Toyota truck systems. 

The trunk is very spacious and can allow for a nice vacation with the family. There are also plenty of nicks and crannies to store cd's or just whatever junk you want to put out of site. This car not only rides smooth, but it drives smooth too. It wisks around turns and emits just enough feel of the road as is necessary. 

The only complaints that I can think of for this car is its somewhat strange styling in the front, which I have gotten used to and actually consider this an attractive vehicle and the sluggish, yet smooth V6 engine.

Like it or not this car is the best selling family sedan on the market in the US right now and for a good reason, it does just about everything good. Yes, there are other cars out there that do exactly what the camry does and do some things better, but its hard to find a car that is as well rounded as this one. If you are considering buying a family sedan then make sure you visit you local Toyota dealer before you decide on anything.
