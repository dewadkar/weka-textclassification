            I purchased this camera at a cheap price of $130, which increased to $200 by adding mail and tax. I found that it is not so fancy, but it works ok.

There are many disadvantages which made me regret buying it, especially at that price. Every photo must be manually retouched in order to get reasonable quality. Also, the standard mode is useless; a STD. photo is not even worth the battery charge. The battery also dies too early, especially when transferring images heavily.

The flash doesn't work right sometimes, and the picture still appears dark in many cases. The lens should be larger to allow more light to enter. Also, fine mode allows only 7/8 pictures to store which aren't enough.


I think this camera suits only beginners who don't need excellent quality. Advanced users should look somewhere else.<br><br>
