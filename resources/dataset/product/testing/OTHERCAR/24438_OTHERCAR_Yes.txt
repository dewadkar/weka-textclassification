                 Before one attempts to purchase a digital camera many things must be considered. Price, Megapixels, picture quality, ease of use, brand name, features, etc. This can be a daunting task considering the wide array of choice available. However considering the Sony Cyber Shot DSC 50 is a leader in all of the above categories I recommend it above all other comparable models.

Personal reflections on:

Mega pixels/picture quality

    The DSC 50 offers 2.1 mega pixels of excellent picture quality, having taken many pictures of various subjects in many different lights I have yet to be disappointed. Furthermore I assert that the DSC 50's picture quality outperforms all others I have used in its class. 

Ease of use:

It did not take very long for me to become familiar with the camera. There are three basic modes play, still, movie. The on screen menus are easy to sift through; one can easily record, view, or delete a picture or mpeg. Charging the battery, changing the battery, and connecting to the computer via usb cable is also a cinch and not problematic.
It is for the most part no more difficult than a conventional point and shoot. 

Features:

Memory

The DSC 50 uses Sony memory stick media. This type of media is priced comparably to other brands and of similar quality. It is also convenient if you own other Sony products such as an mp3 player, they can be swapped. However I am not sure if Sony memory stick plugs into some of the newer printers that allow you to print directly from digital media.

MPEG capability

This is the feature that sold me on this camera. I absolutely love the fact that on my still camera I can record 5-second mpegs with sound. Only a few 2-mega-pixel cameras offer this invaluable feature.  

Software bundle

The editing software from MGI is a powerful tool for importing and then editing your stills and videos. 

Connections

The usb connection on the DSC 50 offers lightening fast transfer between camera and computer. It is worth noting that the Olympus 2 mega pixel camera (a close rival) does not offer an usb connection dramatically slowing its transfer rate and plug and play capabilities. The A/V out on the camera allows one to view their images on their TV or record them to VHS if they should desire. 

Also worth noting is that the 6x digital zoom outperforms all others in its class. 

Price:

Msrp $599, this is a steep price tag, and one would be hard pressed to find it for even slightly cheaper. While there are 2 mega pixel cameras for a little less none compare to the all around quality of the DSC 50. I strongly feel you get what you pay for here although I would have liked more memory, an extra battery, or case for this price. 

Brand Name:

Sony is a quality brand name with excellent customer support and easy accessibility. They offer a wide range of complementary products for the Dsc 50. Digital cameras may be hard and costly to repair but I suspect that more dealers will become competent in this area.
