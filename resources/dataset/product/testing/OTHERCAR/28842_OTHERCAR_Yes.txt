            Hi: We would like to tell you a little about our experience with our DC210 Plus. Before we purchased this camera we had no idea of just what a digital camera could do and the doors that it could open for us. Our very limited photographic experience was evident when we started making enquiries and hopefully intelligent questions to the sales department. We soon learned the variable qualities and prices and realized that the DC210 had the specs and price tag that we could comfortably afford to spend (all this time wondering if it was ever going to be mastered and used or sit and gather dust on a shelf because we could never in a million years master this intimidating little gadget). After having our purchase and warranty safely tucked under our arm we ventured home eager and anxious to capture the world on &quot;digital card&quot;. 
After a few unnerving moments and two calls to the Kodak Hot Line..which was exactly what we needed, we were set up and running and feeling quite like the pros. The software allowed us to edit and enhance and do all kinds of wonderful tricks like rotate our pictures. The camera is rugged and takes very acceptable photos. We are very pleased and after having used it many many times over the past year we are now acting like pros and even have a (card reader) which is a must if you plan on uploading pictures onto the computer and in record breaking speed. The only weakness we have encountered with our camera is that the side plug pins are delicate. We had to have ours repaired (at no expense to us) by Kodak and now show a little more respect for that connection. 
We would definitely purchase another DC210 Plus without hesitation. One of the most endearing features is the tremendous service and assistance we receive from Kodak. A pleasure to own and a definite way to turn a timid digital user into a wild and crazy camera clicking pro. :)<br><br>
