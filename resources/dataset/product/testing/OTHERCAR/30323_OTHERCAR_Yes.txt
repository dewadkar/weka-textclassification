            I received the Vivitar Digital camera as a gift before the birth of my last child.  I had no previous knowledge of experience with using digital cameras.  I must admit I was a bit intimidated by the camera at first but using this one has been a breeze.  It takes fairly good pictures, although sometimes they are a bit dark.  Nothing that a photo editing program can't fix though.  
This camera allows you to take close up and normal pictures.  You can view the pictures as soon as you take them with the LCD screen.  There is also a play back feature that allows you to view all the pictures you've taken.  
Included with the camera are the cables to hook to the computer or tv, the software you need to be able to download your pictures to your computer and batteries and charger.  The charger is a definite plus as digital cameras are notorious battery hogs.
The only thing I have had a problem with is the LCD screen is sometimes slow to turn on.  I also wish that an adapter had been included in the package.
In my opinion this is a good camera for someone just starting out or someone that wants something simple and easy to use.<br><br>
