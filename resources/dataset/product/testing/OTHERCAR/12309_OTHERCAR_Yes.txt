            My friend owns a Black Mitsubishi Eclipse GT and treats it like a little baby. He never pushes the car to the limit (not even close). What's the point in having the power if you don't use it?

Riding in the passenger seat gives a low to the ground view, a bit snug, but also very in style. The dash is completely re-designed, the AC vents are very futuristic, and the stock AM/FM/CD stereo system really kicks. The cockpit wraps around your body. The back seat is good for......well, not much. The hatchback is quite roomy for groceries. The back seat also folds forward if needed.  

I had to see what this car had. So I drove to the dealer and posed as a potential buyer. It's nice to mess with a salesman for once, since they always play with the consumer. We took a red, automatic GT for a spin (loaded with all options). The automatic transmission shifted rather smooth, and did respond when it was teased. You can also shift the transmission as if it were a stick with a side shift option (helps sport things up).

I prefer a stick shift for performance. So we dropped off the automatic and launched a stick. We left the lot @ full throttle. The salesman started to move his feet around the floor board looking for a passenger break (LOL). I took the RPM's to the RED ZONE up to third gear. Needless to say, we were beyond the speed limit (Oops).

I found the low end torque to suffer. It does not have the same punch that the 1991 Eagle Talon All-Wheel-Drive Turbo had. That car jumped off the road. The Mitsubishi Eclipse has decent punch, but lacks the same raw power the early turbo models had. 

The car handled very well into turns, and responded quick when breaking hard. I drove the car for about fifteen minutes and started getting focused on the seat. Perhaps it was the overall positioning of my legs, and the overall comfort. I don't think I'd make it on a short road trip in  this car.

When we got back from the test drive, the salesman did not talk numbers or offer his card. I think he may have soiled himself....(yikes). If I were to purchase the car, I would still have pushed the limit. I want to know what I'm paying for.

With power windows and door locks, an engine immobilizer and anti-theft system, microfiltered air conditioning, height-adjustable driver's seat, CD player, auto-off headlights, cruise control, power sunroof (optional), remote keyless entry, fog lamps, lumbar support and a split-folding rear seat.....you have a handful of niceties. Add a V6 engine, 17-inch wheels,  as well as a premium audio package with side airbags and a 4-disc CD changer, you have the GT fully loaded. 

I feel the car could be priced a tad better for the consumer, however....in comparison to other sports cars it's not that bad.  I recommend this car as a weekend car, not an everyday travel car (long distance). It shows nice (especially with a nice coat of polish, and Armour All on the wheels and tires). It rides nice. Test drive one and see for yourself (you may want to take it easy on the salesmen.. LOL).
