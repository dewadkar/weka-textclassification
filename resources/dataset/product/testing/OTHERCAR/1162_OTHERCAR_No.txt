            I bought my 2000 Dodge Neon ES back in September 1999; I purchased it because I really liked the looks and the affordability. Since, I have had numerous problems, one being vibration. I had the car in the service department last week to have it checked (8800 miles) It only happens when the RPM's go lower than usual and it vibrates like crazy!! . By the way the part for my car is on order- it turns out the motor mounts need to be replaced!!!!! They are supposedly going to be issuing a service bulletin about the replacement of the motor mounts. They have a lot of complaints!!! Strange how it seems a lot of people are having the same problems, just look in http://www.edmonds.com and read all about them in the town hall.
 
 My Dodge dealer I purchased the car from was such a jerk when I had to get other thing repaired prior to this last incident. I have had to have my tire replaced after 2,250 miles. I do understand this is an issue with Goodyear but it is worth mentioning. I dropped my car off at the dealer to have a new tire put on and when I picked up my car that evening I noticed an obvious dent on the driver�s side door. When I asked the service manager what had happened- he wanted to know if it was there before? (I had only had the car for three months and know that there were not any dents anywhere). He did have my dent fixed but I was a bit upset because he gave me the impression that he thought the dent was there prior to the tire blowing out and I was trying to get it fixed for free.
At the end of December I had another problem with my car (2,740 miles). I was driving and started hearing a very large noise coming from the engine. At the suggestion of the service manager had it towed to the dealer and I had recently started a new job so I asked for a loaner car while they repaired my car. The service manager said they did not have one to give me and that it really was not part of my warranty anyway, to be given a loaner, they just gave them if one was available. I put up a bit of a protest and his comment was something like, you know we took care of that tire and even fixed your door for you when it was dented. They should have fixed my door; after all they dented it not me, contrary to what I feel he was insinuating again! He did end up getting me a loaner car and as it turns out there was one in the back lot the whole time but it was totally covered in snow. Sorry I had to make someone brush of the snow but I could not afford to be without a car. My car was fixed and they replaced the timing cover and the tensioner. 

I decided not to go back to this dealer due to the shoddy service I received. I found a new dealer. This time my CD changer quit working and would not release any of my CD�s. I had the car in the beginning on February 2000 (3,425 miles). They took the CD player out and said they could not release two of the CD�s from the changer. When I went back at the end of February to have a brand new CD changer installed they explained the CD�s of mine had not come in but they would call me as soon as they, so I waited for someone to call. I called three to four times since February to see where my CD�s are and each time have been told to call back. When I called on Monday April 3, I talked with the parts manager and he said he would put a tracer on it and I should call him on Friday. When I called him on Friday he explained he had only called once and had not heard anything back. When I got home Friday evening he had left a message on my answering machine and said that the CD�s had been mailed bulk mail on March 22 from Mitsubishi. He said it sometime could take a while to receive things bulk mail and that sometimes people wait three or four months to get them back!

So today I talked with Chrysler in MI and they have told me they only have a record of one CD being sent by the dealer and they have a cap to how much they will give out on lost, yes, the CD's were lost!! They will only give me $25 for two CD's. One of the CD's that was lost was from a $45 box set and the other was about $15. So for $60 in lost CD's they are only going to give me $25, and the quote from DaimlerChrysler in Michigan was &quot;You take the $25 or leave it!!&quot; Very professional!!!

Now my back door windows are leaking!! That makes 5 things total that have had to be serviced on this car. I really liked my car at first but now I hate to think what may go wrong next!!
