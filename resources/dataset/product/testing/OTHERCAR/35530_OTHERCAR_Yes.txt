            I received this camera as a gift from my mother, and she did a lot of research to find the best product.  I also received the docking cradle, which is very simple and quick to use.  Drop the camera in it, push a button, and 'voila!' Your pictures are instantly loaded onto your PC.  The docking cradle also charges the battery simultaneously.
The software that comes with the camera is great, I loved it, until I upgraded to Windows XP, which needed a new version.  The XP version is not as good as the one that came with my camera.
The camera is very easy to use, the menus are very user friendly and easy to understand.  I started using this camera pretty proficiently without barely reading the directions.
It is light and comfortable to use, the casing is strong and the dials and buttons are easily identifiable.  The display on the back is high quality and you can view the pictures clearly on it, even zoom in on them 2x if you choose.
This camera has optional lenses which I also purchased, however the selection is rather limited and you need to buy Kodak's specific lenses.  In addition the adapter for the lenses is metal and it screws into the plastic casing of the camera so you have to be careful not to strip the plastic threading.  Also, when using the lenses, if you use the complete 6.0X zoom, you can see the outline of the lenses in your picture, it creates a round black "border" around your pic.  
Kodak does offer a great package deal on the lenses and camera bag with a couple accessories on their website for a very reasonable price.  I love the camera bag, there are pouches to hold everything.
The battery lasts a long time, even with someone like me who uses the display a lot.  I do sometimes run it out, but if you buy the cradle and the camera you end up with one regular battery and one rechargeable.  On the rare occasion that I run the battery out, I always have a spare in my camera bag.
The only thing I don't like about this camera is trying to make it's menu settings correspond with that of a conventional 35MM camera.  It is hard to figure out how F-Stop, Aperture, etc. come into play within the menu.
