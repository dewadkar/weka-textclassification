            Being a mom with 2 kids and needing a new car, I was drawn to the &quot;mommy&quot; car, a mini-van.  There are so many on the market and they basically all look and drive the same.  What sold me on the Nissan Quest was the free TV/VCR for the van.  I have had no troubles with the car as of yet.  It gets good mileage, the air is great (living in South Florida, it better be), it drives smoothly, very roomy inside and overall I am very pleased.  Coming from 3 Volvo's in a row, its quite a switch to such a roomy automobile. I love the fact that I can separate the children with their own rows and of course the TV/VCR with headphones is the best invention since sliced bread.  I recommend it highly.<br><br>
