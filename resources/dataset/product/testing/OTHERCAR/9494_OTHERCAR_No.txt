            I mainly buy cars and minivans but not too long ago I decided that I needed a pickup truck for transporting all sorts of different things. I looked around and chose the Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab SLT 4 wheel drive. Ever since then, this truck has been okay in performance but not worth the $28,000+ I paid for it.

The engine I got was a 5.2 liter V8. When I first looked at this number, I was surprised. Some of the competition like the Ford F-150 and the Chevy Silverado have only 4.6/4.3 liter V8's. Now even though my truck had a bigger engine, I felt that it was a bit slow, but that alone did not bother me too much.

Next is the inside. The front seats are fairly comfortable even for long drives but the rear bench is not as good. It gives very little knee room which is uncomfortable for even shorter rides.

Not everything in this truck is bad, however. There are 2 convenient map pockets, 2 cup holders, and 2 power sockets all located in the front of the vehicle. The rear has no covered storage bins.

The climate system on the Ram works well. If you want to create more space, you can fold up the rear bench. If the tailgate is lowered the bed can support loads over 8 feet long.

Overall, I do not think that this pickup was the worst vehicle ever made, but I do think that there are better choices. Especially if you are going to spend almost $30,000.
