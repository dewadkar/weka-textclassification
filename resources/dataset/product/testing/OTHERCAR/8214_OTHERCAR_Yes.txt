            After college graduation, I realized it was time to get rid of my old beater for something newer.  Not wanting to spend too much money and needing something dependable for everyday, I was allured by the Hyundai accent.  It was stylish, compact, and the price was right.  I ended up buying a program car with only 8k miles on it and 3 years later, have almost 70k miles.  

I have had a problem with the windows on both the driver and passenger sides - they have come off the track and had to go in for repairs, which were no charge cause I was on warantee until 36k miles.  My husband fears we are in for transmission problems by the way it has been driving lately.  Although we are certainly not experts in auto mechanics.   

Overall, this car has fared very well.  I was  even happier when a year ago my daughter was born.  The 4 DR style makes getting her in and out pretty easy and her carseat fits nicely in back now. We were a little cramped when it was rear facing because the front seat could only go back so far before hitting the back of her car seat.  This was only after we bought a larger car seat than the infant one.   On those overnight visits to Grandma's house, the trunk holds all the baby essentials as long as you don't go too crazy.  I had to put a new battery in this winter, but overall, you get what you pay for.  I didn't pay a lot for this car, but am finding it to be a decent little ride that gets me where I need to go and that is what's important.<br><br>
