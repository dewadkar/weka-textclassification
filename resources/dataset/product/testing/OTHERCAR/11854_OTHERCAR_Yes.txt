            You may notice that this is an update.  I've had the car a year and a half.  Here's my opinion of it after I've driven it for a while.

The good things are it does have reliability and the Honda name.  I haven't had one mechanical problem with it, though you wouldn't expect that for a few years when you buy a new car.  The car is somewhat slow to start (a second or two of "thinking"), and I attribute that to it having a key with a computer chip in it.  It has to engage the fuel, so there is a slight lag.  Not unduly long, but worthy of mentioning.  I like the design of the car.  It drives well and is comfortable.  The gas tank holds 13 gallons.

Though it is a very nice car, it isn't perfect.  Some things still annnoy me on this car:
1) Fuel efficiency.  I can't get more than 30 mpg.  Of course, I'm comparing it to my '93 Civic which still gets 45 mpg in the city after ten years.  My husband says it's because the '93 coupe is more aerodynamic, and the '02 sedan model weighs more and sits up higher.  All I know is that it's not as fuel efficient as my previous Civic.  It gets good mileage, but not great mileage.
2) The speedometer.  The speedometer goes up to 140, and it evenly distributes the numbers, so you only use half your speedometer.  I'm in a Civic, for goodness sakes. It's not a race car--can it even do 110?  Why I find it aggravating is that it's hard to distinguish how fast you're going in your peripheral vision when you only use half the speedometer versus 3/4 of the speedometer in most cars.  
3) The suspension.  I feel every bump on the road.  It handles tight curves well, but bumpy roads are challenging.  Road noise is very apparent.
4) The engine isn't very powerful.  Forget it if you start out at a red light at the bottom of a hill.  You're doomed.  It doesn't have a very powerful engine, and I'm pretty sure you can pay for a more powerful engine in an LX or EX model.

These are the only things that still bug me after 18 months of owning this car.  All I can deal with, but it would be very nice to have better gas mileage.  Don't some minivans almost get 30 mpg?  Overall, if I had to do it again, I'd probably make the same decision.  At the time I bought this car, I didn't know the '03 Corollas would be so good.  However, I needed a car in '02, and the newly designed Corollas wouldn't have been out for another six months.  All in all, I'm happy with my little Civic.
