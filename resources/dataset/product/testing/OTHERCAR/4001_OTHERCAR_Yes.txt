            I own a 92 SL1 (145,000 mi,), I considered buying a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord as a move up to midsize status. My experience with the 92 SL1 has been very favorable, but it was my policy to never buy the 1st model year of a new design. Researched, priced, and test drove both the Camry and Accord. 

To be fair, I checked out a Saturn LS2 just to see what was new. The car definitely does not look sexy, but I was impressed by the value you get for the price and the very high quality of the car. I looked at the mechanical design, engine layout, technical features, and brain picked the Saturn service people about the new design. The LS2 has a beefier space frame more rigidity than the SL, more side impact protection (the doors are as heavy as safe doors)and lots more sound insulation. 

Test drive showed the car to be very quiet, no creaks or rattles, 3.0L V6 engine lots of power, interior room comparable to Honda &amp; Camry but the trunk space is much bigger. The tuned suspension, 15&quot; alloy wheels w/ performance tires makes handling very good. So breaking with tradition, last month I bought a Green 2000 LS-2 with ABS/TRAC option. I have never had as much fun driving to work. I love the eight speaker CD/TAPE/Stero, cruise control, very comfortable seats, everything you could want is standard. 

Who should buy the LS-2?; anyone considering a Camry LE V6 or Accord LX V6, people moving up from Corolla, Civic or SL/SC class compacts. BTW, the LS-2 will be a little sexier if you buy the spoiler option like I did.<br><br>
