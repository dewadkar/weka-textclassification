            Okay, right up front, I have to admit that I am not a car guru, I've not had a LOT of cars, and I don't put a whole lot of my life's focus on cars ... to me they are a way to get from point A to point B ... 

BUT!!!!  I do LOVE this car!!!  It was a 1 year old trade in when I bought it ... new enough for me, but VERY reasonably priced ... I think it listed for around $16,000 new and I bought it (at a year old) for $8,650 or so!  

On the mechanical end of things ... we've had no MAJOR problems ... over 6 yrs, I can imagine there've been 3 or 4 times that I've had to take in in for something other than an oil change or brake pads/shoes(?) ... once was to have a hose replaced ... and in my opinion that was an expensive repair.  Apparently this particular hose is ONLY found on Buicks and maybe only on this model ... and therefore it has to be ordered from the company and costs more than most hoses.  And because of where it connects on the motor, the labor charge was fairly expensive as well.  But, other than a very few relatively minor repairs (no head gasket replacements, etc.) I've honestly felt that this is a very reliable car.

I like the 6 cylinder motor ... very good 'take off' for pulling into traffic .... good speed (a little too good actually) ... no problem with hills and I've even driven it on a few occasions in snow and ice and have had no problems controlling the car.

The body has held up through several minor fender benders and body repairs ... someone side swiped me, I hit a huge dog (devastating), a truck backed into my door in a parking lot, etc.  Each time, the car has come back looking as good as new!

When I first got the car it was in FANTASTIC shape ... like new ... pretty, clean, everything worked great.  Over the years, I've probably NOT taken care of it like I should have ... I've not vacuumed it as often, haven't fixed 'little' problems before they got bigger ... so a lot of my 'complaints' about the interior of the car may be my own fault ... but I'll mention them anyway! *lol*

First and foremost ... you can count on ANYTHING plastic breaking or coming apart by the time the car is 4 or 5 years old ... seat belt buckle covers, the airconditioner vents, the air/heat knob, the glove box latch, etc.  Some of these items I've replaced or repaired, others I've just let go to pot.  It's not so bad that the car looks awful when you get in, but if you really start looking you can notice that one of the airconditioner vents has no 'insides' ... just a plastic 'grill' that covers the front of the opening, but the little flaps that are supposed to adjust the airflow are gone.  When you buckle your seat belt, you can't help but notice that while the buckle works perfectly well, that the plastic cover which makes it look nice is missing, etc.

The tape player went out ages ago, but perhaps I didn't clean it often enough or used dirty tapes in it?  The radio works wonderfully and the speakers sound great for a 'stock' sound system.  At some point around 4 years old the driver's side electric window gradually stopped working.  All the other's work fine, but that one won't go down more than a couple of inches.

The seats are comfortable and wide enough for even a slightly oversized bottom ... I'm 5'8" and my hubby is over 6 ft tall and we both have plenty of leg room and head room in the front seat.  The seats also recline so a passenger can snooze on long trips!  The back seat is reasonably roomy ... fine for the kids, but adults might not be comfy back there for long trips.  The trunk is HUGE and easily holds all our lugage and coolers etc. when going on a trip.

Wow ... I seem to have mentioned more little 'problems' than I have good points ... but honestly I've enjoyed having this car.  I don't even know if they still make Skylarks, but when it comes time to purchase a new car (thought I plan to drive this one till it absolutely cannot be driven any longer, because I really DO NOT want a car payment) then I'll probably check into what kind of mid-sized family cars Buick has available.
