            The mercedes benz SL500 is the best of its class. After my 16th birthday i will own my fathers and it is an all around great car. The engine runs smooth and quiet without any strugling. The car has a unique body and great suspension. This car is a lot better than that crappy Mercedes SLK. The top is easy to but down just by the push and hold of a button. Easy to convert hard top as well. Car runs like a whistle. Goes for $126K. Visit your local mercedes-benz dealer and aquire information for your next mercedes. This car was given to me and i wouldnt want anything else. It is a great car and of course just a Rich boy toy. I love my Benz!!<br><br>
