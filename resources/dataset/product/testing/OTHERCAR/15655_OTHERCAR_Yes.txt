            Since I used my first digital camera in 1996, a lot has changed.  Cameras continue to evolve, but my choice for the very best isn't new.  The Sony FD91 is a terrific blend of power and usability.  With a 3.5&quot; floppy for storage, you have an unlimited capacity before you need to see a computer.  The storage media is cheap, the picture quality excellent.  The FD91 has a 14x zoom, built-in flash, and full control over exposure.  The LCD display is sharp and visible, or you can use a viewfinder for longer battery life.  With megapixel resolution, you get a good picture and it prints well up to even 8x10, though 5x7 is sharper.  You can store JPEGs, or if you don't mind the space, BMP's.  For special occasions, you can put up to 60 seconds of video on a floppy, with sound.  The only improvement I could suggest for the next generation would be a 120MB superdisk.
Battery life is the best part of the FD91.  Recharging is quick, and the battery will last for hundreds of pictures.  

Any of the Sony digitals are great, but the FD91 is definitely the best choice for serious digital photography.<br><br>
