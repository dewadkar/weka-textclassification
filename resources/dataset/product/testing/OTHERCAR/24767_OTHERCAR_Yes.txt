Alas, I dropped my Agfa 1280 digital camera and shattered the lens.   Checking Epinions led me in the right direction for my replacement, the Olympus Stylus 300.  Much smaller and more compact that my unwieldy Agfa [even though I really liked the camera], I couldn&#146t be more pleased with my new selection.

This will not be your typical techno geek review, well, maybe geek, but not techno.

<b> A few small details </b>
It measures approximately 3 � &#147 x 2&#148 x 1 � &#147, weighing around � pound with battery included.  My prior camera needed both hands to hold and operate, you can easily go one-handed with the Stylus 300.  It has 3.2 megapixel, which I admit I have no clue what that means.

It has viewfinder and LCD screen.  The LCD screen measures 1 � &#147.  You can view, edit, and select camera setup on this screen.  It offers &#145slide show&#146 feature, which allows you to view your shots with only the hit of one button.

Stylus 300 comes with battery and recharger.  It is not charged when you receive it, but takes a mere 2 hours to completely charge the battery.  The battery is Lithium and it appears to last for at least 50-60 photos before you need to think about recharging.  It does have a battery power indicator, letting you know the status of your battery while in use so you won&#146t have to worry about losing a shot.

You can use the camera with and without flash.  It has multiple settings:  portrait, landscape, interior, exterior, etc., to choose from, all accessed from the easy to use function keys on the back of the camera.  It also offers a movie option, less sound, that you can view through the camera or through your television [extra hook up required for this].  I haven&#146t ventured there yet but I can imagine it would quickly drain the battery for this feature.   

You can take your own picture with ease, with the remote control button that comes with the camera and the delayed setting on the camera itself.  Great for taking a family pic, especially at reunions, where it seems that one person is always missing from the group portrait.

Stylus 300 comes with the 16mb xD Picture card, rechargeable L1-10B Li-Lon battery with battery charger, USB & video cables, remote control button, wrist strap, CD with drivers & software and a quick reference manual.  It carries a one-year warranty.

It has a manual on the CD for operation and trouble shooting, but you can also visit their web site for information about the camera and its operation &#133&#133..

<b> Which I did </b>
After purchasing my Stylus 300 from Circuit City, I ran into a small problem with operation.  Knowing as little as I do about cameras, I quickly realized the staff at Circuit City knew even less when I had to tell them the battery & recharger CAME with the unit, inside the box.  I visited the Olympus web site and clicked on the link for the interactive support, one Professor Otto.  Unfortunately, the good Professsor could not find an answer to my problem.

I felt defeated.  It was last Saturday night, but I emailed Olympus anyway, stating the problem and hoped for the best.

First thing Monday morning I received a response from them.  I figured it was the usual &#145auto&#146 email, registering my concerns and telling me they would get back to me whenever they could.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the mail and found a complete resolution to the problem from Tom in customer service.  It appeared I had a defective battery, I returned the camera to the store, and received a replacement camera.

I emailed Tom and thanked him for his quick response and indicated I had followed his suggestions, to my satisfaction.  Again Tom responded, the same day, and also offered several &#145insider&#146 tips for the camera operation.  I cannot say enough good things about the Olympus staff and their customer service.


<b> I&#146m the dummy behind the camera </b>
I love photography, I think it is one of the most perfect visual mediums offered.  I wish I was more adept with my picture taking but I lack finesse.  This camera at least gives me an opportunity to pretend I know what I am doing.  The pictures have been sharp and clear.  Coupled with my Photo Impressions on my new computer, I can do almost anything I want with this baby.

Set up on my computer took less than 5 minutes, learning the ins and outs of the camera is still up for debate!  However, given time I am sure I can be a whole lot smarter than my sales person was, actually, I might already be &#150 grin &#150 at least I knew what came with the camera.

The Olympus Stylus300 is designed to be very user friendly.  If you have been thinking about a digital camera and aren&#146t sure where to start, this would be a great one to begin the fun.  I have a friend that owns this one, or rather did, and also the Olympus Camedia Zoom C-5050.  Her pictures, aerial shots of the city, were incredible.  You could read license plates on the cars!

As a point of note, the reason she no longer owns her Stylus 300, it is weatherproof &#150 not waterproof.  When she took a dip in the New River on a rafting trip, the camera unfortunately did not recover as well as she did.  You can use this baby outside in inclement weather, but don&#146t give it a dip in the pond.
