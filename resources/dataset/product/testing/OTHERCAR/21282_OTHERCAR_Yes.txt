            This is a great family car.  I bought a used '92 Camry LE about four years ago and absolutely love it.  It handles well and has a powerful engine for a four cylinder.  I average 24 miles per gallon.  Not bad for an 8 year old car!  The only drawback for this year's model: - the breaking system can grind a bit at times. I've had it checked out and my mechanic said it performs fine and not to worry about it.  However, I've read that this is typical for the early 90's Camry.  I would recommend this car or any Toyota for that matter.Enjoy.<br><br>
