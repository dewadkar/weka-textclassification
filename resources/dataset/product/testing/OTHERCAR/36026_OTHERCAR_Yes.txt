            In April of 2001, I traded in my 1996 Saab 900S five door automatic for my new 2001 VW Jetta GLX (see my epinion on that one, too).  I loved the Saab, but I wanted something a little more fun to drive, and I longed for a stick-shift again.  Never-the-less, if you are considering a used Saab, I think you could do worse than the 900, assuming you can afford the upkeep.

First, used Saabs are a great value.  Saab values plummet in the first few years, which is great for folks who want used ones at reasonable prices.  My 900 had leather, a sunroof, a great stereo, and the world's most comfortable seats (heated) and the car was thousands less than it's competitors when new and tens of thousands less when used.  The 900 is a hatchback, which means that you'll be amazed when you see SUV-like cargo space from a car the size of an A4 or a 323i.  I drove the car while I was a college student, and I could honestly fit all my worldly possessions in the hatch with the rear seats folded.  

Overall, Saabs are also very efficient, and the 900 is no exception.  Sure, the non-turbo 4 cyl. motor is a bit slow and harsh, but you'll get great gas mileage from it and it lasts a long while, even if it is pricey to maintain.  The layout is functional and attractive, and the car can be configured to fit lots of people and/or tons of stuff.  All this in a small and uniquely styled package.  Personally, I recommend only driving manual transmission Saabs with the Turbo engines, otherwise performance will be disappointing.

Driving the 900 was always a pleasure, but not always fun, if that makes sense.  The car is loud.  It's sluggish.  It handles well, but there is lots of body roll.  It takes bumps about as well as a Chevy truck.  Yet, those seats are indeed the world's finest and the overall quality of all materials is impressive.  

Saabs are fun to own because not everyone else does.  Owning a 900 makes you feel smart--you get a great car at a very good price, one which can take lots of folks and lots of junk just about anywhere and in comfort.  The cars are wonderful in the winter, and they last a long while if you are willing to put up with the excessive maintenance bills.  I had my 900 from 43,000 to 83,000 miles, and it was a great car overall.  For the money, a used 900 is a good buy.  And, when considering new Saabs, I personally recommend the 9-5, which is also a great value but also fun-to-drive and easier on the wallet over time.
