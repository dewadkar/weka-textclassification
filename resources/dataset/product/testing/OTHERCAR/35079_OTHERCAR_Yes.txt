            WE BOUGHT OUR 1994 DODGE CARAVAN USED WITH 4000 MILES ON IT; WE NOW HAVE 65000 MILES AND THE VAN RUNS GREAT, THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE TRANSMISSION WENT AT 32000 MILES AND AGAIN AT 63000 MILES THE SECOND JOB WAS DONE BECAUSE THE DEALER TRIED TO CUT CORNERS AND DID NOT REPLACE SOME PARTS,WHEN THEY REBUILT IT THE FIRST TIME. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT NEW VANS AND SUV'S BUT I JUST CAN'T SEE BUYING A NEW ONE WHEN OURS IS PRETTY MUCH TROUBLE FREE.WE ALSO HAVE A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LIMITED WHICH I LEAVE SIT 90% OF THE TIME BECAUSE THE VAN IS MORE COMFORTABLE AND SMOOTHER RIDING AND A LOT EASY WITH THE KIDS.YOU CAN NOT BEAT THE CONVENIENCE THE VAN GIVES. IF I BUY ANOTHER VAN IT WOULD BE A CARAVAN !! I THINK THE CARAVAN EVEN MAY 1994 HAS A BETTER RIDE THEN SOME OF THE OTHER VANS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE BRAND NEW 2000's.<br><br>
