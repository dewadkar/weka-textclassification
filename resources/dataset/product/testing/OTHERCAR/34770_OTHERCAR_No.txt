            This car has a lot going for it. Good power, good grip, eye-grabbing styling, great interior, good functionality around town as well as on the back roads. I came very close to buying one. The problem? I drove one back to back with a Porsche Boxster. As the saying goes: Porsche - there's no substitute. The Boxster simply blows the TT away in just about every category you could care to mention - for around the same price. The only thing the TT can claim as an advantage is its AWD system - but guess what, even that doesn't really add up to much when you compare the two cars in real-life situations. The Boxster is quicker, it has a better clutch/transmission linkage, much better throttle response, it's lighter, it handles better, it is assembled better, it has more trunk space. It sounds (exhaust, etc.) MUCH better! When I think back, the only place where the TT seemed to have an advantage was in the interior design - which in the TT is stunning. The seats were also a bit nicer than the Boxster's in my opinion -  but only just. Most other areas are pretty even (convertible top, sound system, etc.). The Porsche also feels hand-built. The TT is well made, but still has little things about it that make it feel mass-produced.

So, let me explain why I don't think the Audi AWD thing is such a big deal when comparing the TT vs. a Boxster. AWD is a great thing for bad weather driving - and even for dry pavement in certain situations! I'm actually a big AWD fan. However, in the TT it doesn't really make that big a difference. It adds a lot of weight to the car, first of all. Secondly, the tires on this car are high performance, wide, sticky tires - great for sporty driving on dry and wet pavement - but dangerously useless for snow/ice. So, if you're smart, you'll put winter tires on the TT for the winter season, or put it away in the garage. Guess what. The same applies to the Boxster. Even without AWD, the Boxster's perfect weight distribution, sticky performance tires and mid-engine design provides unbelievable grip and handling on dry and rainy days - far superior to the TT's actually. And, when the snow comes, you are better off putting the Boxster in the garage as well. AWD does not add up to a significant advantage for the Audi in a sports car the way it does for a performance sedan/wagon like the A4 or A6. 

These cars are 2-door sporty coupe/convertibles! When the road conditions get truly awful, you'll want to put them away and not expose them to salt, mud, etc.!! Don't bite on the AWD argument. It's a non-factor in this case.

My local Audi dealer is also a Porsche dealer. I went in looking for a TT. I was impressed when I drove the 225 hp model. However, then I drove a Boxster, and it completely ate the TT's lunch! Dont' get me wrong, the TT is a great car. Just not when you drive it back to back with a truly awesome car. It's a matter of perspective.

So, for just a little bit more than the price of a loaded TT, I'm going with a decently appointed Boxster.
