            Back in the summer of 2001, company business dictated that I commute 80 miles each way to a job site for 6 weeks.

My V10 engined F250 Super Duty was going to be expensive and impractical to run and so I rented a compact. I had never owned a Japanese car before, having bought mostly Ford products in the twenty five years that I have been driving. So when I was offered a selection of vehicles, I chose a new 2001 model Toyota Corolla.

I was so impressed by the car that I decided that when my pick-up truck lease was paid up at the end of the year, I would buy a compact as a general run-around �commuter� vehicle and buy something with a little more �sex-appeal� when I found something that caught my eye.

When the time came, I went to a local car rental company and rented a new model Ford Escort with 18,000 miles on the clock. If you are thinking of buying a car, I recommend that instead of testing only the brand new demonstration vehicle at the dealership, that as a more realistic test you try and rent the model that you want, so that you can experience what it will be like when it has a few thousand fairly hard miles under the hood. To say that I was horrified by the Escort would be an understatement! I rented another Corolla the same day with 12,000 miles on the clock and was reassured that my initial impression of the car had been accurate.  I had also driven a �98 Civic and had been pretty impressed by it. However, I could not get even close the deal that Toyota were offering me and so I did not bother to road test one of the new Civics.

Within a short period of time, I had acquired a 2002 model, white Corolla S with all the extras for an amazing $13,900 in San Diego. I purchased an extended warranty for it and a decent car alarm, which bought the figure with taxes to over $14,500.

I am extremely satisfied with the result. I get over 40mpg on a long sedate drive and rarely get less than the low 30s� even in town. The seats are acceptably comfortable and the interior room is more than adequate. The build quality is excellent and although a little plain, the interior trim for the most part, fits and functions well. The car feels solid and well constructed and there is an impressive absence of road or wind noise. Visibility is good and the brakes, although a little wooden in feel, are more than up to the job. Performance for a small mass produced four door sedan is adequate. I recently drove it from southern California to Colorado and back again without suffering any real discomfort or fatigue. At one point out in the Nevada desert, on an empty road, I was cruising at an effortless 100mph without experiencing any undue stability or noise problems. 

If I were to complain about anything, and these points are minor, the spacing between first and second main gears in the transmission is too wide and makes for a disappointingly large gap between the two gears leaving you somewhat �dead in the water� waiting for the revs to pick up when you nip out into traffic. Another more minor issue regards the flimsy dash mounted cup holder. If you have anything such as a phone cord plugged into the dash mounted power socket, cups will not fit correctly and could fall out. 

The center console storage is an odd shape which means that if you put more than one large item in there, it is very awkward to find anything. Another minor niggle that I have, and this is common to a lot of cars, concerns the ignition switch on the steering column which is positioned so that if you have any large keys on the key ring, they keep dragging across your leg which becomes irritating after a while. I would also like at least one more choice of intermittent wiper speed setting as the standard setting is too fast. Other than these minor observations, the car �rocks� for what I need it for. 

I am originally from England and so grew up with small sedans. I also raced them for a while when I was younger and a lot more reckless. When I read peoples� comments about the lack-luster performance of the Corolla I am, frankly, amazed by their total lack of perception! If it is performance that they are after, what on earth are they doing buying a Toyota Corolla in the first place? I have also come across several comments regarding the vehicles handling characteristics. I GUARANTEE that, given a closed course, I could force most of those people to change their minds long before I ran the Corolla off the edge of the track. If anyone out there reading this is even approaching the true limits of this vehicles handling capabilities then they need to be racing on a closed course as our lives are in danger. (also bear in mind that what some red light racers perceive as the vehicles limits are often way short of the true limits!)

If you want tight, �low roll� handling, go spend some more money and lower the suspension with up-rated struts; upgrade the sway bars and buy a set of high performance wheels and tires. The problem with that is, all of a sudden you no longer have a comfy shopping sedan and the lowered front end is all smashed up where you ran into the concrete curb in the Safeway parking lot! When I was seventeen, I would have given anything for a small shopping sedan with an 1800cc, twin overhead camshaft, fuel injected engine which had tubular exhaust headers as standard! Around two decades ago, Ford Europe produced a similar spec engine in an Escort (admittedly turning out a little more power) and won the World Rally Championship several years running.

I even read a review that remarked on the lack of interior room!! Now, call me psychic if you will, but the interior of the Corolla is not incredibly roomy because IT IS A SMALL VEHICLE! If it is room that you are after, buy a Crown Victoria!

If you want a reliable, economical, well built four door compact vehicle with good interior accommodation for four regular sized people (CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT IT IS A SMALL VEHICLE,) then the Corolla is for you. If you want something a little more �hip� with better all round performance and a little less of everything else, then consider the Honda Civic. A great car for a bit more money. If you read any reliable publication in the motoring section of your local Barnes & Noble, you will find the Corolla at or near the top of the reliability and economy chart.

I highly recommend it.
