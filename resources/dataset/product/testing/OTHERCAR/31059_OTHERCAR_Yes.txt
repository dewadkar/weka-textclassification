            Well, this review is gonna need to be updated. Paid $12745 for my 2 door manual transmision Echo today  December 23rd at 5:30 pm. At 11:15 pm of my first day of the purchase the accesories fuse was blown up. Very rare. Tomorrow will use my warranty service to fix it. 
The new design is really beautiful. A good deal of chrome in the correct places. Looks more expensive than really is. Like it's response, very agile. No power steering :-(...
My sister in law has an Echo of year 2000, it only needed repairs in the window knobs system and the gas of the air conditioning system. It works fine. 
The choice of colors is great. I chose charcoal gray and it looks very elegant. I also like a lot that it has plenty of spaces in the dash to put things.
Having 14" inches tires looks and feels better than before. 
A neighbor showed me his 2002 Echo and although I liked it I prefer the design of 2003. I promise I will update this review frequently to keep you informed of my experience.

Second day: (24 december 2002)
Accesories fuse is ok, it seems to be a problem with a loose connection in this area of the wiring. Failed a couple of times today but nothing serious. Will ask for warranty service soon. Today I had my first long trip on my new car. Terrific! Put 96 miles in it today. Excellent! Very little gas consumption, nice ride, although a little bit stiff. I forgot to mention, it has manual transmission, 5 speed, air conditioning, factory am/fm radio with cd player and six speakers, factory alarm anti theft system, carpets, rubber liner in the trunk over the carpet, 3 year 36k miles warranty bumper to bumper, 5 year 60k miles warranty on powertrain, road assistance paid for 3 years, 14 inches steel wheels with plastic anti theft covers, new design in front and back of vehicle, adjustable steering wheel, VVTI type engine with 1.5 liter displacement. I don't know if I have to mention it, but I really like this car!

Third day
Took my car to the dealer. Accesories problem fixed. Was a loose connection in the computer area. Works great now. I can't believe I have run almost 215 miles in 2 days since I bought it and haven't spend yet half tank. It's a real deal to drive a car so good with so little gas consumption. 

17 days later:
I love this car. I have put gas in it only 3 times, never let it run empty, never filled it completely since I bought it, and it has run 661 miles with this quantity of gas. It is super economic to run! People tell me they like more the new design of this car, so I think I made a good decision to buy this model.

2 months and one week later...
I get 330 miles from a gas tank, most of them in the city, with only about 100 miles on highways. Runs perfect. Will install tinted glass on it. I love this car... did I say this before? LOL!!! ;-)

2 months and a half later...
There is nothing I can complain about my Echo. I have found it very convenient to park in small places in crowded parking lots. And everything works fine. Soon I will make a test with it. I plan to drive around the island in one day, with a tank full of gas to see how many miles of mainly highway driving I get from it. It will be a nice experiment. Some people complain about body roll on highways or certain unstability of the car due to the design. Sometimes I have felt it, but it's not common. It usually happens on highways if I'm driving too fast and with certain conditions of weather or road. Mainly it is very stable and safe to drive. At 65 mph it usually runs ok. I don't drive too fast, so I can't give you a report based on high speed, I don't favor driving like that. I strongly recommend that you enjoy your car and drive safely. Will report soon to give you new my experiment results. And I also recommend you to visit this place: www.echofans.net and get any information you need. Open an account and see all the great photos and information they have there. Enjoy!!!

Installed tinted glass on my car on Saturday, March 22 2003. Looks great. Will publish photos soon.
In this days that oil is going to be more expensive than ever I have good news for you: My Echo gives me 356 miles per tank full of gas, mainly city driving and with air conditioning on at least two thirds of the time. I plan to make a long highway travel to test gas performance on highway driving.

Monday May 5 2003
I made a record, 360 miles from a tank full of gas! Very economic in these times... Still working perfect thanks to God!!!
