            I recently borrowed a friends jeep for the weekend and put it through its paces. This is a very strudy vehicle! With its 4-wheel drive capability and suspension system, it is almost indestructable. I took it off road and it handled very well. There wasn't much it wouldn't go over. I could not get it stuck, believe me i tried! In the summer time it has got to be a fun toy to have because everything is so easily removed. It can be made into a complete convertable in a matter of minutes. It is pretty noise on the highway, but it is well worth it if you are and off road person. I highly recommend this one.<br><br>
