            I bought my Jeep two weeks after the Blizzard of 1996.  One week after totaling my Hyundai on black ice.  Since day 1, my Jeep has been a blast.  I've changed the oil every three thousand miles religiously and have made sure that it's well maintained.  I have had VERY FEW problems with my Jeep and it's now four years old and running strong.  The only thing you might need to watch out for is the catalytic converter.  They tend to fall apart for some reason, but the warranty on them is 70,000 miles, so you should be ok.  other than that- it's been great- noisy, bumpy, and drafty- but great.  There really is no in between with jeeps- you either love them or hate them. But I'll tell you, there's nothing like cruising with the top down on a nice spring afternoon, or popping it into 4-wheel drive to get through a foot of snow.  And for the money, you can't beat the versatility.   <br><br>
