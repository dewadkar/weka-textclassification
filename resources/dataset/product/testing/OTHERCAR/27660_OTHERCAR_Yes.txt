            The 1995 Hyundai Accent is a good reliable car.  It was given to me by my father as a graduation present.  I took it to the snow for a year while I went to college.  It warmed up fast and the heater was AWESOME.  When it was time to come to California, my father had a job in Alaska and needed to use it.  He drove all the way to Alaska from California to and fro twice.  
This car has only needed work on the tires(because of traveling) and the Air Conditioning.  It also has a rattle that gets pretty annoying.  
It's a cute car and can be considered a family automobile.  The interior is very roomy, and the body style and colors are neat.  
This car is a little speedster.  It can get speed fast with no problem, so you might not want this car if you have a need for speed.
