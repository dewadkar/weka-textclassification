            I'm on my second Nissan Maxima SE.  I bought a 2001, then traded it in for a 2003 (more horsepower!).  I have owned over 9 cars in the last 14 years and I will never own anything but a Nissan for the rest of my life, specifically the Nissan Maxima SE.

The looks of this car had to grow on me when they remodeled it, as with any car changes.  Once it did, I was hooked.  The styling is sporty, refined, classy.  It's one of a very few select true sports sedans.  I can carry 5 people and still fly down the freeway and have get-up-and-go.

Once you slide behind the wheel, hear the purr of the engine and put the car in motion, you will instantly be hooked.  The 2003 Maxima has 255 hp.  It has both low end and high end torque so from the moment you touch the accelerator, you are off and running.  The power of this car is amazing.  Zero to 60 times range from 6.2 seconds to 6.8 seconds, depending on the transmission you choose.  For those who do their own "tweeking" I have many friends who have clocked less than 5.5 seconds in their Max's.

The interior is stylish, classy and comfortable.  Seats are very comfortable and don't hurt after long rides.  All controls needed are on the steering wheel so that the driver doesn't have to look away from the road.  In mine, I have auto climate control, which I recommend to everyone.  I set it at 77 degrees and it keeps me comfortable all the time, automatically increasing or decreasing the speed of the fan based on car temperature.

The 2003 edition Maxima's came with aluminim alloy wheels, which I love.  Clean, sassy and definately eye catchers for most people.  The SE automatically comes with 17 inch tires, also classy, but expensive to replace.  I had to replace one on my previous car to the tune of $244 for one tire.  Treadlife for the tires is between 40K - 50K, depending on how you drive.

The 2003 also has Xenon headlights, the other reason I traded.  I love them!  Everything looks much clearer and easier to see.  Unfortunately, only the headlights are Xenon.  The fog lights are regular colored.  You can purchase Halogen or white colored lights for the fog lights to keep the look the same, which I plan to do very soon.

Pricing is so different depending on area and what discount you may get it's hard to list a price.  I get Nissan Employee pricing due to work relations.  I purchased a fully loaded SE that listed for $32,500 for $26K even with my employee discount, then got $1,500 for the rebate being offered.  Nice catch for the horsepower and stlye of the car.

Insurance rates are the same as a standard sedan.  My insurance is no higher on my Maxima than it was on my pokey bland Toyota Camry (don't get me wrong, Camry's are great cars, just no pizazz!)

All in all, one of the best cars built.  Nissan has continued to win the best engine award and there is a reason for that.  More powerful that luxury low and mid range BMW's and Mercedes for alot less money.  More stlye and class on the interior than an Acura, for sure.
