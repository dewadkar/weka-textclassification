            I just purchased the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 and I can't believe it!  It is truly a great first camera.  My husband and I were completely new to digital cameras and really didn't know where to turn.  We went to our local Wal-mart and the boy wasn't much help either.  He kind of got smart with us and really that is what made us decide to purchase this particular camera.  I am so glad that we did. 

 I wanted a camera that was easy for beginners.  If you are also looking for that, then this is it.  It can with the necessary software and cable plugins as well.  It even has a super nice carrying case.  And for once, the batteries were actually included!  I got to reading the information that came with the camera and it was very user friendly. 

 However, there were sometimes that it left me hanging.  Low and behold, Polaroid has a great website with online support and help.  I some how got the language on my new camera set on Dutch.  For the life of me, I could not change it back to English.  I search the booklet over and over to find some help.  It was nowhere to be found in the book.  I did locate the web address and there it was right in front of me.  How to change the language mode.  I couldn't believe it!  Here I was once, upset that the instructions weren't complete, and I went to pleased as punch when I found what I was looking for within seconds on the web.

  What a great service Polaroid offers!  After I got that straightened out, I was ready to take pictures.  With a few clicks of the button, my new album began.  It was very easy to get the rest of the equipment required installed to get MY pictures on the web!

  I am having a blast with this new toy!  I have even learned within in minutes to send pictures to family far away.  Wow!  What technology!  This is definitely the beginners camera!  The price is reasonable, less than 200$.  I will never own another brand of camera again.  If I decide to upgrade, it would be nothing but a Polaroid for us.<br><br>
