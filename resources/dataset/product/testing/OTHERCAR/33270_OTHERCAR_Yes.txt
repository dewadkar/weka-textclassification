            My husband and I decided to buy our plymouth voyager because we had outgrown our 1986 mercury cougar.  We had had it for 12 years and knew we had gotten about all we could from it.  We have three children, therefore, we wanted something roomier.  
I love the room in this vehicle and the gas mileage is pretty good to.  It is a wonderful vehicle to drive in the rain, because you sit higher in it and are better able to see.  Other passing cars can't throw as much water onto you when in the van.  I didn't like the tires we had on this van.  They were goodyear and by the time we had put 25,000 miles on it, we were having to replace two of the original tires.  About 10,000 miles later, we replaced the third tire.
Driving this vehicle is a pleasure.  It has never let us down, and after two and a half years, we still find it dependable and roomy.
People who have small children or even older children would enjoy this van.  It's great for taking our girls and their friends places.  We can easily accomidate 3-4 of their friends at one time.  It is an easy and comfortable riding experience.  I can't think of anyone who should't buy the plymouth voyager.<br><br>
