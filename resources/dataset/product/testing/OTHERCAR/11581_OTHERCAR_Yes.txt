            The new 1999 rodeo purchased by a good friend recently is a beautiful vehicle and a real pleasure to drive. Sure, it doesn't get the mileage of a Civic, but you know that going in. It does seem to get the rated MPG, going around 19-20 on mostly highway (but frequently during rush hour)traffic.

It handles smoothly, has great acceleration, stops on a dime and is oh-so-quiet on the road. The factory sound system is decent and the amenities in the LS model are almost everything you get with the top-end LSE (no leather or moonroof standard on LS, everything else is).

On the negative side, one significant and one trivial (but why did they do that?); I'm only 5'10&quot; and need to put the driver's seat all the way back AND lean it back one notch to keep my hair from being brushed by the headliner. The headroom should be adjusted by design or by adjustable height seats. The trivial one, but surprising, is the lack of a lock gas cap included, or better yet, a locking cover (???Izuzu???).

My friend wisely got the model with the spare tire below, rather than on the tailgate, where a minor bump has been shown to cause SUVs (in general) to risk blowing out the rear window. It makes a much cleaner look anyway.

Below I say there were no visits to shop. There were actually 2 shop visits, but they had to do with the trailer hitch the dealer had put on.<br><br>
