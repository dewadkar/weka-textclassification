            I needed a reliable car when I was driving close to 100 miles a day to and from work. I wanted one that wasn't real big and got good gas mileage. I checked around and decided on a brand new 1996 Chevrolet Geo Metro, that was what it was called when I bought it. 

It has been a very reliable car ever since I bought it. The only thing it has needed has been the normal thing cars always need: oil changes, tires, brake pads, air filter, etc. I have never had a problem with it mechanically. The only time it has been to a mechanic has been to receive a state inspection. 

It does get a little difficult driving when the weather is extremely windy. It has done very well in the snow. I have a 2 door hatchback, so there isn't much of a trunk. This caused problems for my husband and I once our daughter was born because we can't take it on vacation. It is the perfect car though for a single person or even a couple. <br><br>
