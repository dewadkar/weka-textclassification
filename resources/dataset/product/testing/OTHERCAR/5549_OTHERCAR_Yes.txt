            Granted I have not driven allot of Suv's (except Isuzuo Amigo) but this Sidekick Sport edition looks fantastic (lots of people comment)and  feels good at less price then the Honda models .  Its like a trip to the amusement park but better. Why? You feel the bumps but its a still a comfortable controllable smooth ride and it gets you where you want to go and thats no small feat. I urge anyone who has an urge to feel something more then the next rolly polly air-ride to try this fun machine. This thing hugs your body, wraps you around the road and its totally responsive and it has lots of style. This is not like the majority of the suvs or cars for that matter that run  and you hardly know your on the road . Please note, I am talking the sports edition here.  This sport edition is sharp , better looking then regular model unlike what one reviewer wrote and its not that easy to find for 98,maybe for good reason and Suzuki added 500 lbs to the weight for the first time in 98 maybe because they were reacting to bad rollover review to one of their previous years models. Suzuki ended up suing the magazine (consumer reports) and while I am not sure how it turned out, this years model benefited.  If you like a small Suv, you probably can't help yourself from liking this. I  just got into this thing and I didn't want to get out, probably more for the young or like me young at heart (48). Make no mistake , this is not a Chevy blazer, or Ford Explorer,or Montego Suv, but rather the sporty lighter brother, like a toy or cycle you always wanted but couldn't afford until maybe now .The name of this thing describes it exactly : sidekick sport and while its not as big as some of the others, I just urge you to try this toy out.   Afraid of shakes or rollover or stability? I was very aware of past years models (small Samurai writeups) and drove 60mph with automatic overdrive (not sure if this is optional on all models)and had no fears - man what a blast and NO shakes or fears at ALL of rollover. My old van had more shakes then this. Close the windows and this thing is quiet, a real surprise. Gas consumption is really good in fact fantastic- I got 80 miles on a quarter of a gas tank and to me that was a real eye opener and surprise .What more can I say but so far so good but have not had it very long to talk about reliability. In addition to extra weight they added two inches to width on the sport . This is a four wheel drive model even though I have not used that part yet. Brakes,Air cond and power windows including back windows are good. I am  happy with it so far. You can fold down the back seats for nice room. I only hope the build stays strong because I would want an exact copy if it went bad.Of course there is a chance I just have not driven enough suvs to know what I am missing.Is this fun or what? 

Now compared to the Amigo: (I test drove two amigos for a long time) Amigo has slightly better engine.Realize I am not unhappy with the Suzuki, especially in overdrive . Amigo is way more unstable,a bit more smoother  but way more uncontrollable and scary  and well at times rigid , like it lays there . The air conditioning in amigo was not as good as the suzuki. The back window could not go down in the amigo . But for the  all important handling the suzuki has it all over the Amigo , at least for fun.- smooth yet very close to the road and responsive. I think this particular model just rocks , perfect size, style and weight. You want to rock ,try it.
