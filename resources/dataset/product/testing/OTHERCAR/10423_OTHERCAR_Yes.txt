            I recently purchased a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and I love it! It is has such a smooth ride, it's hard to believe I'm in a Sport Utility Vehicle.  The seats are extremely comfortable, making the ride that much more enjoyable.  The seats slide an extreme distance giving a multitude of drivers use the vehicle  It is very roomy, allowing you to spread out quite comfortably.  The steering wheel is leather wrapped providing a comfortable grip. The basic stereo system is far from basic.  It stores 12 radio stations and the 4 speakers mounted in the doors provide a smooth and clean sound.  The speakers have a very high distortion rate, thus allowing you to put the power windows down and still hear you stereo.  The power windows are controlled quite easily from the driver side door, including the auto-down feature for the driver.  With the windows up, the interior is mysteriously quiet eliminating almost all outside and engine noise.  The gauge cluster is well-spaced providing ease of readability.  The computer located overhead provides, temperature, compass, trip time, odometer, and two gas mileage features. The center console is roomy and contains slots for CD cases to fit in.  Overhead also is a garage door opener holder and a sunglass holder.  Both visors have lighted mirrors.  The rear seat splits 60/40 including the bench allowing for extra room to the already large cargo area and still allowing passengers in the rear.
The inline 6 cylinder engine provides plenty of power for ease of highway merging and everyday driving.  The 4-wheel drive system contains multiple settings.  There is 2-WD, part-time 4-WD, High-Range 4-WD, and Low-Range 4-WD, allowing driving in almost any condition.
The heating will cook anyone out of the car in a matter of seconds.  The air-conditioning will freeze you out even faster. The rear window flips up for easy access to the cargo area.  The intermittent windshield wipers take care of anything natuer can throw at you, including the rear wiper. The courtesy lights light up the night as you exit the car and the remote entry provide for easy access to the vehicle.
I love my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and would recommend one to anybody!
