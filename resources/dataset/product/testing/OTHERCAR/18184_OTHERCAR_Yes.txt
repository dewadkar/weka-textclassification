            I bought a 1996 Pathfinder LE used in 1999.  It only had 36k miles on it, and figured it was one of those 3 year lease deals that got turned in.  Was in great shape when I got it, and didn't seem like it had ever been taken off road (not seriously, anyway).  Has a lot of options - power windows/locks/steering, etc; 4wd; ABS brakes; alarm.  I chose it because I wanted a nice SUV, and the price was right.  

I go camping a lot where I need 4wd.  For general purpose, it works fine.  However, one of the very first times I was out on some really bad roads, it did something to the frame.  I thought it had merely knocked it out of alignment, but the repair place said they couldn't fix it because the frame was bent.  I didn't think I had gone over THAT rough of a road.  

I also tow a heavy trailer.  I've considered trading the Pathfinder in for something with a V8, however, it really doesn't do a bad job pulling the weight.  I've decided it's not worth it to trade it in, just to be able to go 10-15 miles faster up hills.  The V6 is peppy, and without the trailer it has some spunk.

The Pathfinder is fairly comfortable, although on long trips I do notice a slight back strain.  There is plenty of room inside for passengers and gear.  I like the rear split seat design, so I can fold one seat down for long items, and still keep one rear seat up for my son.  I've also used the roof rack quite a bit.  

Visibility is ok.  Again, not great when you're trying to look behind you to merge lanes, but generally it's ok.  I would like to sit a little higher, but that's just my preference.  

Other than the cd player jamming, there really hasn't been any unusual mechanical difficulties.  Just standard stuff, like brakes, etc.  

I'm not completely thrilled with the styling - to me it looks a little like a family sedan - whereas I prefer a more sporty look.  But again, that's personal preference.  

Although I like the Pathfinder and it has worked out pretty well for me, I might be tempted to buy a 4-Runner next time around.
