            I bought my new 2002 VW GTI 1.8T a few weeks ago.  Boy was I excited.  After my '98 Civic died on me (yup, a 4 year old Honda breaking down on me.  I still can't figure it out) I thought I'd try the fine German engineering I've been hearing so much about.  My GTI is a 1.8 turbo engine with automatic transmission.

First off, the engine.  The 1.8T has 1.8 liters while cranking out 180 horses, a step up from the 150 that the 2001 model had.  A VR6 model is available in manual only but a new 201 HP engine is due out in a few months.  The 1.8T is good enough for me though.  The ride is smooth and it takes off once you step on the gas.  There is a bit of lag noticeable when you push the engine, but still, the acceleration is great.  The automatic transmission comes with the tiptronic system, which is manual shifting without the clutch.  While it's a nice feature, I could do without it.  The feel is not the same as a real manual anyway.  However, if you want to learn manual driving, this might provide, somewhat of a general feel to it.  Steering is pretty good as well.  It has a soft suspension which some might like, and others might not.  Living in New York, I like the soft suspension with all the lovely potholes we have on the highways and such.  But unless you're a rally racer, looking to join the WRC, it shouldn't be a problem.

The exterior and interior styling is the same as the Golf.  However, the GTI comes available in only the 2 door version.  I would prefer a 4 door version but at least the easy entry system makes it easier for my friends to climb in and out of the rear.  Instead of the driver or passenger seats just sliding forward, the seat lifts up from behind and slides forward, giving a bit more room for your friends to hop in.  The rear seats provide 33.5 inches of leg room.  Supposedly 3 people can fit in the back, providing 3 headrests.  But lets not fool ourselves, unless you have really small friends or kids.  There's no way I can fit 3 of my friends in the back.  I'd be lucky to get in 2 without constant complaining.  The cargo space was surprising to me.  Being a hatchback, I didn't think it could hold all that much.  Rear cargo space, while I forget the exact numbers, can hold pretty much a big suit case with a few smaller pieces of luggage.  Of course, if I'm wrong, you can always fold down the rear seats which give you so much more space.

One of the great features of any Volkswagen is that it comes with a ton of standard features.  You could do without any options since there are so many standard features.  Daytime running lights, air conditioner, in dash cd player, driver and passenger air bags, side air bags, curtain air bags, cruise control, power windows, power side mirrors, defrost side mirrors, ABS, keyless entry system, and much more.  Of course, since they overload you with tons of standard features, the rest of the options come in packages.  I added the luxury package which includes tinted power sunroof with pinch protection, and the Monsoon sound system.  You can also get the leather package which gives you leather seats, 3 spoke leather padded steering wheel, and leather shift knob, heated seats, and so forth.  The individual options are auto transmission and 17 inch alloy wheels.  The GTI comes standard with 16 inch alloys.  

The Monsoon sound system is ok.  I don't know how it is, compared to the regular stereo but it's really nothing special.  You can also get a 6 CD trunk mounted changer through the dealer.  If you feel no need for the other options, base price for the GTI 1.8T runs about $18,800.  I think it's a great deal and you get a lot for your money.  Gas mileage is decent, but I guess I was a bit spoiled from driving a Honda Civic in that department.  Since I do a lot of highway driving, I'd say you can go about 250+ miles before you refuel.  VW also says that only premium unleaded fuel should be used for the GTI.

The interior bits seem to be well constructed.  Nothing inside feels cheap.  One gripe with the car is the cupholder.  It's right above the stereo, so when you put a drink in there, it's blocking the buttons.  Plus my friend who drives a '99 Jetta has had problem with the cupholder which is placed in the same area.  The springs inside broke and cost her about $300 to fix.  However, I hope VW has constructed it to be more durable.  One of my favorite features about the GTI or any VW for that matter are the dashboard lights.  The gauges are backlit with blue and the needles are red.  The buttons are all red also, like in an Audi or BMW.  It's a nice touch and looks great.

The car comes with a 5 year/60,000 mile powertrain warranty.  It also comes with a 12 year unlimited distance limited warranty against corrosion perforation.  All in all, I think the VW GTI is a great car for its price.  The drive is smooth and has very minimal engine noise.  Its sporty, hatchback look will turn some heads and almost all the time, it'll be a good thing.  With typical German engineering, and smooth steering and driving, the VW GTI is bringing the fun back to pocket rockets.
