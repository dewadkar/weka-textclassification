            My first car ever was an 85 Chevy Cavalier. I had never driven a 5 speed and of course this one was a 5 speed. We bought it used from a cousin who owned a used car lot. This was the best car ever! I really put it thru hard times just learning how to drive it...but it held up great! I decided that I wanted a new car right after I got married. I also wanted a four door (my 85 Cavalier was two door). I had no question though what car I would buy....a Chevy Cavalier! After all, mine had well over 140,000 miles and the only thing wrong was a minor oil leak from the oil pan (a result from my drive scrapping the underneath - long story!) Anyway....we set out and came home with my 97 red Cavalier (four door).  I still have it and have had very few problems.

I did have trouble with the parking break being too tight at first. It seemed like the dealership had it more than I did. But they were always polite and quick to work on it. They always had a free rental car for us. The only reason it took so long to fix it was because they didn't know what was causing it. After we filled out a survey form in our manual book we got a call from the manager at the plant my car was made in.  He called our dealership and told them just how to fix the brake problem....two days later it was fixed! I haven't had any trouble since.

The only complaint I have is some wind noise that comes from my windshield on the front passenger side.  We tried to get it fixed and it worked for a month or so but came back.  We just never did take it back to get it worked on. Other than that though.....this is a GREAT car!

I also had my battery die on me once while I was out...I got a ride home and after my husband came home we called the dealership down the road (not the one we bought it at). They sent a tow truck down to get my car and gave me a new battery.  I didn't have to pay a cent...thanks to my warranty.  They were very friendly and quick to get us on our way.  Thumbs up on the 1997 Chevy Cavalier!<br><br>
