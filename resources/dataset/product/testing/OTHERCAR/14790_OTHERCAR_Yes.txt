            I purchased this camera from my small business supplier on his recommendation that it would be quick to set up and easy to use partly due to the excellent manual that accompanies this camera.  The software went to work immediately after installation.  The camera operation was easy to follow and put to work quickly.  Adjustments for light, flash, picture quality were easy to set and change.  The camera connects quickly to the computers I use and the images can be reviewed and downloaded easily to any storage destination.  
Battery life is almost doubled when the LCD screen is OFF, but being able to review your photos in the field makes this playback feature essential.  The use of rechargable batteries has helped me keep my camera fully operational at all times at a low cost.
I am looking into purchasing more storage compact flash cards to expand the volume of photos taken in the field before I download to my notebook back at the car.  
After four months with this camera, I am sold on its ease of use and excellent quality. <br><br>
