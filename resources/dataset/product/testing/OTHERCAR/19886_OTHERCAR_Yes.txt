            I purchased this product from Ubid.com.  I have to say it is the best digital camera I have seen for the price.  I paid $269.  Its features are incredible for the money.  It has a 2X zoom and a LCD display on the back that is the perfect size for viewing.  The colors are unbeleivable.  They are vibrant and glowing.  When I upload the pictures onto the computer, they look beautiful.  The compactness and the weight are also really good features of this camera.  

I can't really say that there are many drawbacks about this camera.  And the ones that are present are menial.  The first thing is that the upload of the pictures to the computer is somewhat slow, but not bad.  And of course it's not a 2megapixel camera.  But again, for the money, it's great.  It comes with usually a 16 meg memory card.  And under the best setting, it can only take 20 pictures, but again on the lowest setting, it can take about 60 pictures.  In my honest opinion, I didnt see much of a difference between these settings.  

Overall, I would recommend this digital camera to anyone in the market for one.  No need to go out and spend $800 on a camera that works JUST as good for $269.<br><br>
