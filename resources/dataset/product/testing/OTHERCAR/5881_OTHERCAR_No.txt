            I recently had the opportunity to drive a '03 Outlander rental vehicle for a couple of days. I will make some allowances with this vehicle because it was a rental model, and probably the 8,000 miles that are on the odometer so far have been tougher than the average owner would typically made them. I'll give it a bonus star in attempt to compensate for rental abuse. 

That said, there was no indication that anything had been abused in this particular car. The paint was good and the interior untarnished in any way.
My initial impression of the interior was favorable for the most part. It <i>looks</i> nice. Tapping on the dash board will quickly ruin this presumption. It's extremely hollow and plastic-sounding, as if there is nothing but a thin shell of plastic between you and the engine compartment's firewall.

The seats are fairly comfortable, and I didn't notice them, which is good. The back seat, however, is unbelievably uncomfortable. I could find no way to "recline" the back of the seat, and the angle was actually acute! The back of the seat pushed my shoulders forward, forcing me to lean forward uncomfortably. If there is a "recline," it's so well-hidden that you'll need the owner's manual to figure it out.

The instrument gauge is the most unattractive part of the interior. The two little bumps that make up the MPH and RPM gauges feel squished and awkward. Unless I was going between 0 and 30 mph, I could not see how fast I was going without moving the steering wheel to an uncomfortable height. Even then it wasn't terribly visible. I guess I'm spoiled by my ION instrument panel, which is center-mounted if you didn't know, and it allows me to see how fast I'm going without doing any sort of adjusting. Because of its well-illuminated needles, I can see how fast I'm going without even looking directly at the gauge. 
But I guess most of you are used to moving your hand/wheel to see the speedo, so the Outlander won't disappoint on that standard.  :)

Engine power was acceptable but only just. I felt uncomfortable doing any sort of quick acceleration to merge into traffic, because when I did open up the throttle, I didn't get the response I expected. It seemed to be suffocating instead of charging forward confidently.

But being a 4-cylinder SUV, I guess that's to be expected.

The "manumatic" transmission that my unit was equipped with was acceptable, but gimmicky at best. Using the manual feature results in jarring gear changes, not unlike a 16-year-old learning to drive a manual transmission. At night, most things are illuminated well, with the noted exception of the gearbox. I had to blindly seek "reverse" with the shifter, because there is absolutely no light down there...not even a little LED to indicate that I'm in park or drive. In a vehicle where the power lock switches have lights, this seems quite an oversight.

I was also a bit perturbed by the not-so-noteworthy gas mileage. For the lack of power that this 4 cylinder engine provides, I expected to average over 24 mpg over 3 days of driving...I did not.

Another gripe: The clock is analog! Yes, I can read an analog clock, but it's in the center of the dash, and it's faintly illuminated at night, and stylized enough that you'll really have to look carefully to see what time it is. The fact that this "retro," "classy" little clock is set into a dash made of fake carbon fiber (that feels hollow, like i mentioned before) is too bad. Why not just an easy-to-read digital clock? 

Other thoughts: Why no trunk area light? When the trunk is open, the light above the dash turns on, which doesn't exactly help you see anything in the back of the car. 

If you like the "look" of this car, then that's well and good. I personally think it resembles too closely a tall Subaru Outback, minus the ruggedness.

In short, the Outlander is a decent vehicle, and a decent cargo hauler, for a starting price of just a hair under 20K, I would look elsewhere, specifically Honda, Toyota, or Saturn, which all have similar vehicles that do a better job of what this vehicle is trying to do.
