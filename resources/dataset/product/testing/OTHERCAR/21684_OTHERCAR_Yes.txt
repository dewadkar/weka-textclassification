            My husband and I bought our Prizm in 1998.  It was a manager's demo model with 6,000 miles on it, and because of that, the price was right and the vehicle was loaded.  We had planned to spend about 13,000 on a bare bones model originally, but when we saw (via the net) that our local dealer had a more souped up model available in our price range, we negotiated a deal through email and went to the dealership to test drive the car.  Boy, are we glad we did!  
Our number one priority was great reliability for the money. Consumer reports reccomended the LSI model over the basic one for a smoother ride and our test drives proved this to be worthy advice.  I love the fold down integrated child safety seat, as it is handy for occasionally hauling around my friend's 2 year old son. One seat also folds down in the back, to expand the trunk. Two other features that really gave us peace of mind were the front dual airbags and side impact airbags.  The car also has antilock brakes. 
As long as you don't need an especially spacious cab, this car is a good bargain for what you'll get.<br><br>
