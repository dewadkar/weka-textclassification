            ok - i've heard a lot of mixed reviews on eclipse's and now i've had one for over 2 1/2 years and i'll tell you that if you don't spend a good deal of time making sure that this kitten is purrin' right, she's gonna turn around and bite you in the wallet. I bought the car at 32k and shortly after that my clutch blew causing a kick-back to blow the hydraulics in the clutch-pedal to go as well (but i beat the hell out of her tho). had a 'friend of a friend' do the work to replace the parts needed and found out why you don't take the lowest bidder (not like i really had a choice tho) - he ended up not replacing the seals correctly (factory specs say when you do that type of work to replace all seals removed) so my transmission leaked till it was bone-dry (took it to the guy NUMEROUS times and he had no idea what the problem was - should tell ya something) and i killed my 3rd and 5th gears (highest on the pole - got no lube) so i had to have my entire transmission replaced - but i learned my lesson the first time and paid the big bucks to have the dealer do it ($2,500.00+tax) with a nice warranty (that will no doubt expire the day before it breaks again). can't say i've had TOO many problems with it except that the person who owned it before me obviously had it modified up and down - the interior accents were all painted purple - wtf?!.. - the rear tower-brace had obviously been removed recently - the muffler's tip was HACKED OFF and there was a particulearly UGLY *GOLD* tip screwed on to it for 'performance' i guess and had just about blown out the back left shock (i kindly finished the job...). just had new suspension put in and would enjoy the car driving like a dream if i hadn't bent one of the control arms for the steering running a curb like a moron. also - this has been the absolute most fun car to install a sterio in (4 12" subs fiberglass-molded box fit to striped down trunk/rubber-molded-lining/bolted down with all the power they need plus all the right wiring custom-ran and hidden // modified rear speaker containment for 6x9 infinity 3-ways // 5 1/4" clairion subs in doors // 2" titanium tipped clarion tweets custom installed into factory tweeter slots // kenwood flip-face // every single piece of the interior that wasn't welded to the frame was removed and insulated with about 100lbs of foam/rubber/latex sealent // all work done by yours truely thank you very much... :). one thing i actually enjoyed doing but shouldn't need to be done was the sunroof (yes, RS with a factory sunroof) stopped working right (slipping off the tracks - not closing all the way - not sliding smoothly) and because i refuse to let the dealership tell me i need an entirely new one, i took it completely out (you'd be suprised how easy this was) and took it completely apart / cleaned every last moving piece / stripped the 'lubricant' out of every crevice i could find and then re-lubricated the entire unit once put back together with heavy-duty engine grease - since then - it works like it was right out of the factory - no noises or bumps.

all in all, if you want to have this sporty-LOOKING car and not pay an arm and a leg you better be a do-it-yourselfer or you are looking at paying BIG BUCKS to keep it up.
