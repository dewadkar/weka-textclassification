            I have driven Volvos for many years and they have spoiled me for any other make of car.  I was loaned a Volvo S40 for two weeks and I have been most impressed. The build quality is better than most and the finish is, to my eye, flawless. One of the main reasons I came to like Volvos is the fact that the seats are truly ergonomic, after many hours driving one is not left with an uncomfortable back. The engine is smooth and powerful for a car of this size and in traffic, on the open road or poodling in town, I would be hard pressed to find fault.  I think this will probably be on my shopping list when I come to change my present Volvo, which will probably not be for some time as I rather like it.<br><br>
