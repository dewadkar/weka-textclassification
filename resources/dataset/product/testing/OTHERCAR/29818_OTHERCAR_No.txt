            I bought this camera on the basis of brand name and recommendation of a friend.

I was pleased with the quality of the pictures, but other factors made me less happy.  The camera format is chunky and inconvenient.  It doesn't easily fit into a coat pocket and it feels heavy, might not be any heavier than smaller cameras just feels it.

I also had to return the camera as the focus started to malfunction, in addition I got dust in the viewfinder that wouldn't go away.  These happened within 3 weeks of the warranty expiring.  I would have been very unhappy if this had happened 3 weeks later and Kodak had turned me down.

Photo quality was great.  Tho' it took the camera a long time to recover after taking two pictures in a row.  Not a camera for quick shots.

At this point the 260 has been replaced by better cameras.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
