            I own a 1996 Grand Prix, Hunter Green. 

I have owned 4 cars in the past 8yrs and 2 of them have been Pontiacs. My first car was a 1978 Yellow Firebird, my second which is my Grand Prix. I love the way the car handles and the way it looks. I truely believe that Pontiac has the best looking cars around.  

The only problem I have with my car is the power steering. Which has gone out once and It seems to be leaking fluid again.  

I have decided that my next purchase will be the  new Bonneville. (BEAUTIFUL)

I recommend the Pontiac Grand Prix to anyone.<br><br>
