            The 1995 Lincoln Continental is a tremendous upgrade from the previous models. The new V8 32 valve engine gives this car the power a full-size car needs to glide or zoom!
I Think every car on the road wishes it was a Lincoln Continental. Definitely not an Old mans car of the Geezer type. This is the dream car of the gadjeteer, Sports car fan and Comfort seeker. With its sleek design, wiz-bang Electronics, and Smooth ride. This is the greatest car I have ever owned. Lincoln, truly American Luxury. Mine now has 75K Miles and does not miss a beat. Great ride. I used to hate driving, now I know why those old men drive their Lincolns so slow... They never want to get out of them.
