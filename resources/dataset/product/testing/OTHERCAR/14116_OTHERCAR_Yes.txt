            Having recently driven a Dodge Viper ACR (American Club Racing), I am a new man. I realized that there are still cars which can lay out a strip of rubber from here to Timbucktoo when you side step the clutch and throw it into first. The Viper ACR is an incredible car that will do anything you ask of it at whatever speed.

The race-ready Dodge Viper ACR comes with five point safety harnesses that hold you on to your seat. Also for shorter rides and ones where you won't be going at such high speeds there is a normal three-point seat belt (this is a great feature and makes the car easier to ride in). When climbing into the car be careful of the side exhaust pipes which are hot even though no direct contact is made with them. Inside the car is pretty cramped, but who cares when you drop the pedal and are rocketed to 60 mph in a mere 4.2 seconds. Compared to anything for that price and even at much higher prices it blows the competition away. 

Visually of course the Viper is an attention getter. Before you stop anywhere be prepared to wait and talk to the wide eyed people that have stopped and gathered around the Viper. And, as you have to be willing to assume with such a car, the insurance and tickets you can get with this car are a lot.

Before you go and get a Viper remember that this is a race car. You can do crazy things with it but be sure to know your limits not the car's.

BHP- 460 (10 more than the GTS)
TORQUE- 500
0-60- 4.2 seconds
0-100- 10 seconds flat
LATERAL ACCELERATION- .98g (incredible)
