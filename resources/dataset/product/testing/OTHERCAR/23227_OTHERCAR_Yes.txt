            I purchased my Breeze in 1996, because the car I owned before that was giving me some problems.  I fell in love with the Breeze when I first saw it. I have 2 children and there was enough room that they could sit comfortably in the back and have plenty of room to play on long trips.  I also loved the truck space.  I have been able to take a week's vacation -- including kids stuff and not have to put anything in the back seat!  YEAH!  <br>I believe that anyone would be happy with this car.  I have not had any problems out of mine.  I get GREAT GAS mileage  ( and that means a lot today).<br>I usually make 2-3 600 mile trips per year (with the kids).  Cudos to Plymouth for making the seats comfy enough to withstand the long ride!!!<br><br><br>
