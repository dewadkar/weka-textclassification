            There's absolutely nothing majorly wrong with this vehicle that continues to provide safe, reliable transportation in adequate comfort for me the past five years and 60kmi.

You'll notice that "adequate" is used often in the review because this car doesn't shine in any one area nor does it fail miserably in any area neither. Okay, so it's kind of boring!

The interior is nicely laid out and relatively roomy.
The plastics are of the softtouch variety and the fit and finish is first-rate. The ride is nice and firm with no squeaks or rattle. The trunk is nice and roomy.

The reliability of this car is fantastic. The only things I had to fix outside of the normal wear and tear items were a lightbulb ($5) and a power window regulator ($150). That's it. Just oil it, gas it, and go!
