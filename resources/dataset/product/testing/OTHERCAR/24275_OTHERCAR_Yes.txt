            Tiffany and I own an ISP in northern Nevada. As part of our customer service we have a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee which is used to cover a local 6000 square mile service area. Our tech puts about 45 thousand miles a year in all conditions from High desert Heat to mountain Snow. Despite mediocre gas mileage the truck has been reliable and is a good candidate for a person or company looking for a quality truck at an affordable price. What our company does is find a good used Jeep with about 40 -50 thousand miles, buy it for about $15000 then run the truck until it has 100-115 thousand miles on it.
We then sell the unit and replace it with a year newer model. This procedure has given us the best bang for the buck by far in comparison with buying new. Gas mileage for the V8 versions runs about 16mpg with the 6 cylinder versions running about 18mpg.
As a whole the truck  and it's predecessors have been reliable companions for our techs. The only negative reports from the field we have are regarding the  ''on demand four wheel drive&quot;
system. After our experience this winter our next  Jeep will have the full time Quadratrac system to better handle unexpected road conditions.<br><br>
