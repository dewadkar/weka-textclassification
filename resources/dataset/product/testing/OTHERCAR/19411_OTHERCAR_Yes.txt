            My husband and I were interested in a SUV for quite sometime before we bought our CR-V.  We had shopped around at all the other dealers, but in the end, we came back to the CR-V by Honda.  It is roomier than the others and has a better looking exterior.  Honda also had less car maintenance complaints than others we looked into.
This SUV is great for us. We have a small baby, and the CR-V makes it so much easier to get him in and out of his car seat. It also has plenty of room.  We took a 12 hour road trip in ours, and we found it to be very comfortable.  It also held a lot of luggage and baby paraphernalia.  Our highway gas mileage was good, too.
The front window gives a better view of the road ahead than many other cars we test drove.  It takes awhile to get used to, but now I can't imagine not seeing as much.
Honestly, the only thing about the CR-V that I could complain about is city gas mileage.  I drive a very short distance to work in a lot of stop and go traffic.  My CR-V gets about 18 miles per gallon with my city driving.
This car is wonderful for couples just starting their family and for those who like to get up and go at a moment's notice.  It is not for larger families with more than two kids.<br><br>
