            I am not a big fan of minivans, but the Pontiac Montana is probably the best car that my family has ever owned.  It has plenty of room for just about anything, as well as many accessories including two electric seats, leather, an electric door, an air pump, and a very powerful V-6 engine.  

Driving the minivan is a great experience.  It's not as fun as a sports car, but it handles very nicely.  It has great traction in all kinds of weather.  In the snow, it has a traction control system combined with state-of-the-art ABS that make it very easy to accelerate or brake without skidding.  The engine is a lot stronger than other minivans.  The Montana was recently rear-ended and we were given a rental Ford Windstar, which accelerates much, much slower and is quite a pain when merging onto a highway.  It gets good gas mileage for a car that size, too: about 26mpg.

Inside the car, everything rocks.  One of my favorite features is that the lights come on automatically when it is dark out (there is some delay so they don't turn on when you go under a bridge, etc.)  The Windstar does not include this feature, so I often end up forgetting to turn on the lights when I start driving it.  The dashboard is illuminated with red light, which is used frequently by pilots, astronomers and military because it does not cause your pupils to contract, allowing better night vision.  Another great feature is the rear passenger sound system and climate control, although these are standard on most minivans now.  The radio is one of the first to feature an "info" button, which displays information about current and upcoming songs on various radio stations.  Not many stations support Info yet, but they probably will soon.

The only problems we have had were that once the heated seats stopped working and at another time the rear air conditioning broke.  Both were fixed.  There is also the problem intrinsic to all minivans, that they are such a "mom" car and are "totally uncool, man."  If you don't care about that, though, a minivan is quite a practical vehicle.
