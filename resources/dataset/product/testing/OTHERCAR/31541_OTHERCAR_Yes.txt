             I was given this camera for a Christmas present, so I did not have any choice of what camera I got.  I received the Fuji MX - 1700, and I love it.  

  The picture quality is great and I can take it to party's e.t.c and take good quality pictures.  I also went to look round a castle for my sisters school project and we took some pictures with it.  When I got home the pictures were amazing.  

  The design is very compact with lots of nice little features.  The little lcd screen is really neat and at first I thought if you tough it I might break it or something, but I soon found out that there was a protective plastic cover over it.

  I like the little feature for example you can do special effects on the camera, you can do some continuous shooting for a little while.  It is very easy to view the picture and if you do not like it you can take it again.  This is especially useful if at a party someone wasn't looking.  With a normal camera you go home with half a film of rubbish.<br><br>
