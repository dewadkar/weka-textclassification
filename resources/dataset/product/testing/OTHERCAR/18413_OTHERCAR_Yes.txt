            Hewlett-Packard Photosmart 320 Digital Camera

My husband and I bought this camera because we have a baby on the way and just want something around the house to capture those special moments.  I am a graduate of an AAS in Photography so it&#146s far from the type of digital camera that I would like but it does the job for now.  But whether or not it will work for you is the question? 

Some of the features to get you acquainted with the HP Photosmart 320 are as follows:

2.1 megapixel resolution 
This works well for snapshots and printing 5x7&#146s or smaller, any larger than that and the quality decreases.

8 MB of memory
This is equivalent to probably a roll of film if you are shooting medium quality.  It also comes with an upgradeable memory card for a good price which I do recommend.

Video clip feature 
This is a cute feature that allows you to take short video clips.  You can then download them on a computer and send a hello to grandparents or whomever.  It works best in bright light.

USB connect plug with slot for optional dock

Digital zoom:
Zoom up to 4X--but because the zoom function is digital and not optical the picture quality suffers a great bit.  I don&#146t really like this feature but it can be useful in some instances.

HP Instant Share technology:
This feature allows you to send your photos automatically via e-mail.  I haven&#146t used this feature yet because I like to edit my pictures on the computer first but it is nice to have if it is a feature that you would use.

Auto-flash and red-eye reduction 

3 levels of quality:
You can set the camera to take three different types of quality photo depending on the use. 1-is the lowest quality, but allows you to store up to 76 images. 2-is a medium quality and size, storing up to 13 images. 3-is the best but the camera can only hold about 7 images so if you are going to be away from a computer taking pics then I recommend a memory card.

Photo Editing Software:
The software that comes with the camera is easy to use.  Photos are saved in JPEG format, making them easily transferable to many other editing programs if you wish.  I prefer Adobe Photoshop but for beginners this software will do the trick.

I enjoy this camera for snapshots but it does have a few flaws, don&#146t we all??

This camera eats up AA batteries so as I did, I recommend getting a charger and using rechargeable batteries, especially if you like using the LCD viewfinder.  Or you can put the extra money into the dock for recharging.

The manual viewfinder is not an accurate shot composition, if I remember correctly it cuts off more on the right hand side so if you like accurate composition then this is a bit of a problem.  I just compensate for the difference although it is a nuisance.

This camera suits my needs for baby snapshots and those quick &#147wish I had a camera moments&#148 but for anything close to a professional level, I don&#146t recommend this camera.
