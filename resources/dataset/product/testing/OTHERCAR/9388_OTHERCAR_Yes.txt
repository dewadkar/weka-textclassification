            After owning several Japanese sedans in the previous years, I was ready for more than another &quot;cookie cutter&quot; type of vehicle. I started looking at German made vehicles because of their reputation. I looked at Audi, BMW. The Audi and BMW's are fine cars but I just couldn't justify the cost for what I would have received. I never really gave a thought to the Volkswagon line since the name Volkswagon made me think of the old Beetles. One day while passing the Volkswagon dealership I noticed the line-up of cars they had on the lot. I decided to take a closer look since I was in the market for another car. The first car I looked at was a Passat. The salesman offered me a test drive so I figured what the heck. That was all it took. I was so impressed by the way this car drove and looked that I started to research everything I could find on the internet. This led me to the Jetta. I returned to the dealership and started looking at the Jetta's. The salesman showed me several different ones then showed me the only Wolfsberg Edition he had. There were so many options that were standard on this version for about $200.00 more than the GLS model. I asked what the trade off was. There was no trade off. I settled on a 1999 tornado red one with the upgraded 5 spoke chrome wheels. This car demands attention with it's bright color and special wheels. I have never owned a vehicle that so many people have inquired about.

This car is so fun to drive that I hate to get out of it. It's not the fastest car on the road but it sticks to the pavement like glue. The instrumentation is well laid out. The sport seats hold you in place no matter how hard you steer. The trunk is huge. You can't tell by the outside of the car, but when you open the lid it seems to go forever. The interior is a little cramped in the rear. It is a little snug for 4 adults. The back seats are more suited for children. Overall this is a very fine vehicle. I will buy another Volkswagon for sure. But next time I will move up to the Passat.<br><br>
