            Please see my other epinion under "Plymouth Colt", which is the other name this car was marketed under.

IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD SAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF MITSUBISHI ABOUT THIS CAR, IT WOULD BE... PLEASE STICK TO MAKING TUNA FISH. YOUR CARS STINK!

Let's see... what wonderful thing can I say about my 1988 Colt/Mirage??? How'z about... my good car is a Ford Fiesta.  

Oddly enough, what we have here is the best and worst in cars. 

The Ford Fiesta= Simply one of the best, most intelligently built cars EVER produced to this day. Fast, fun, reliable, and cheap to maintain.

The Mitsubishi Colt/Mirage= 100% SWILL!

Okay, I'll give the Colt/Mirage kudos for being somewhat reliable and good on gas. But it gets NO awards for; comfort, handling, power, instilling driver confidence, inexpensiveness to maintain, intelligent design, quality... the list goes on.  The things that have simply broken on this car are from down-right manufacturing cost-cutting greed. Things like rear door hinge welds all breaking off, thus having the door just fall off, rear bumper mounts that ROT off while there is not one spec of rust or rot anywhere else on the car. How about the dash, door vinyl, and plastic consul either cracking horribly or discoloring. How about the shiny reflective material in both headlamps oxidizing. Or how about the vent louvers just breaking into pieces just from adjusting the air flow direction.  

Want more fun??? Try doing an oil change. If you're lucky enough to get the under-body plastic trim piece off without breaking it in order to gain access to the very- hard-to-reach oil filter, then you'll love getting the new filter to screw onto the threaded filter plate. You won't have much luck, though. You must hold (and turn) the filter in a very strange position in order to start the threads to catch. WHAT A PAIN!  Did I mention that my gas pedal sticks? Did I mention that the passenger side door has loud wind noise and shakes a lot at highway speeds? Did I mention the automatic transmission shifts at the wrong speeds? Did I forget to mention how the engine no power, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd? Did I mention that the intermittent wipers don't have a long enough delay for drizzle-type rain? UGH!!! This car is AWFUL. It doesn't even handle well in the rain or snow with new tires. 

DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE CARS!!!!

ps. The factory paint job stinks and the front door locks work in a strange manner.
