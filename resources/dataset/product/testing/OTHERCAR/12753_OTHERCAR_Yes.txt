            This past December my dad bought a FujiFilm MX-2700 Digital Camera.  Immediately i took it under my wing and played with it as much as i could.  The very first test was inside the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena for North Carolina State University's Fall 1999 Graduation Commencement.  My sister was Valedictorian out of 7000 people in her class and she was up on stage with all the important people.......so i didnt want to miss this opportunity to use the new digital camera.  The pictures came out great.  The next test was just me playing with it for all possible experiences.  Anything and everything i took pictures of.  All my friends were like &quot;that thing is dope...is your dad a spy or something?&quot;  I just laughed all the way to the computer where I put the paper thin 32 MB SmartMedia card into the External USB Card Reader and then pictures came up onto the screen with speed you wont believe.  I prefer to take my pictures with the highest resolution possible....and even with the 1800x1200 resolution, i could fit 30 or so images on one 32 MB card.  And if you dont require that resolution and fineness, you can fit over 300 images on there.  You can also hook this thing up to your tv with an s-video and video input connection that is provided.  Plus there is an 180,000 pixel screen on the camera that you can view everything on.  Really people......this camera is sweet.<br><br>
