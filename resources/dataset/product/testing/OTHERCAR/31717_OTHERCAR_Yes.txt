            Last week, after months and months of checking out car lots, and newspapers, we found the perfect car. Not only was it the perfect color, white, it also had all the features we wanted on it as well. Its pearl white with a spoiler on the back. It has alloy wheels and keyless entry. These were the 3 things we were hoping to find. It also has a security system in it, called the silencer. We were disappointed when we got out and took a closer look and noticed that it was a 2000. We were hoping not to spend as much money, so we were looking for a nice used 98, or 99. Well after dealing with the sales man about it we got it for over 18,000. I believe we could not have went wrong here. We had looked at 99's with all the features we wanted and they were asking 16,000 for them. We then got in the car kept it overnight, and FELL IN LOVE. It's got enough room in it for a family and rides very well in bad weather. WE signed papers on the day when it was icy here, (which never happens here) and it handled the road well! I highly recommend you to check out the Intrepid before you consider bulling otherwise. I always said, &quot;You will NEVER catch me riding in a Dodge much less BUYING one&quot; well let's just say I have pretty much ate those words. <br><br>
