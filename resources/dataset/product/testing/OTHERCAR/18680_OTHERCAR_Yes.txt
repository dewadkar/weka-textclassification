            The Sony MVC-FD92 is an excellent digital camera.  I purchased the camera to capture pictures of my newborn.  After spending more than $45 at Wal-mart for one photo shoot and another $60 at Sears for the next photo shoot just three months later,  I decided that I may use those funds more wisely if I created my own photos at home.  I researched all the digital cameras available at that time and decided to wait until the MVC-FD92 was available.  By shopping online I was able to find it at a reduced price from that which is published in stores and on Sony's website.  From the first minute that I removed the camera from the box and charged the battery, I was taking photos and showing them to everyone immediately after taking them.  I was experimenting with using the various settings on the camera to take photos in black and white, sepia, etc.  Everyone loved the instant gratification that came with seeing their photo on the LCD.  After taking pictures of my cousin's 1 year birthday party, I was able to copy some of the best pictures from the memory stick to a floppy disk and give it to the mother before I left the party.  That was an extra special gift! She loved it.  The FD92 also allows the user to upload pictures to the computer directly from the camera; however, I found this process to be slow.   I purchased a memory stick reader that is USB compatible and was off to the races uploading 100s of photos quickly.  The larger size and fine settings on this camera allow you to take pictures that cannot be easily distinguished from film images.  Warning, the larger size photos are memory hogs and greatly limit the number of photos that may be taken at the larger settings.  I invested in a 16mb memory stick, but will purchase at least another 32mb to satisfy my appetite for finer photos.  I love this camera. It is the only camera that I take on vacation and use around the house.  I  use this camera for everything from photographing the items for my pictorial shopping list to making photo charms for jewelry.  It was an excellent investment and I have not spent one dime in photo studios since I purchased my Sony MVC-FD92
