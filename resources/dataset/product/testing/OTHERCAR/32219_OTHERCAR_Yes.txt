            The 93 Acura Vigor is a machine with a purpose.  It's purpose is to haul balls and look good doing it.  This car has an inline 5-cylinder engine that puts out 176 HP at 6800rpms and 170 ftlbs of torque.  The car itself looks like a low-profile luxury car with all the little trim things you would expect to see on an expensive car.  It has some sexy leather seats and wood paneling on the inside, and comes with an extremely nice sounding 'DSP' am/fm/tape player and 8 speaker stereo, with 2 sets of tweeters in the front, 1 set above your head and 1 in the corners of the dash.  I personally don't have the tweeters hooked up as I have about $3000 worth of high-end stereo equipment in mine that just plain sounds better than any stock tweeters could hope to :)

I bought my car for $8500 in pretty much mint condition except for one or two tiny dings in the doors, and got it from the only previous owners of the car.  It was well-maintained and I had a pre-buyer inspection done on it.  They found nothing wrong with the car at all.  I drove it for a month, and impressed the pants off all my friends, and then bad luck hit me and the reverse fork in my transmission broke.  There wasn't any way to see that it was weak before I bought the car so I'm not too angry about it, except for the fact that it cost me about $2170 to fix!!

Other than the transmission, the car drives wonderfully, you can barely even feel potholes in the road, much less casual bumps, and with the windows all shut you can barely hear the road, even when you're going 90 mph.  Everything on the car is power (sunroof, mirrors, door locks, antenna, drivers seat) and it even has some things I've never seen in a car before.  There is a third sun-visor that folds down directly over your rearview mirror and blocks the sun that always gets in through there when you turn a corner.  There is a little light on each side of the back seat that shines down in the back and you don't even notice it in front while driving in the dark, each light has a button on it to turn it on.  

However there are also some things that aren't so great.  The back seats can fit 2 people comfortably.  But only if they're 3 feet tall.  There is virtually no leg room at all in the back seats if you don't have the front seats quite far forward.  I am 6'0" and it is uncomfortable for me to drive with anyone behind me who isnt really small.  Without anyone in the back you have plenty of room though, in fact it feels like you're swimming in leather.  Or laying in a bed of it anyways.  You feel like you're sitting almost on the ground and you're part of the car while driving it.  Another drawback to the car is that there is NO CUPHOLDER!!!  Have you ever heard of ANY sort of a car without a cupholder?  Much less a luxury (or near-luxury if you want to be technical) car with no cupholder.  Anyways there is an aftermarket cupholder somewhere that fits right in front of the shifter in the car, but if you have a manual vigor you're SOL.  

The car gets about 20 miles a gallon, though I've gotten as low as 11-12 (had a leaky tire) and as high as 24.  Unfortunately you have to put premium gas in it.  Expect to pay about as much for gas as if you had a nice big v6 truck getting 14-15 mpg on normal gas.  It's not terribly cheap.  However you have to know what to expect when you're buying a car that was $30,000 new.

Generally the car is thought of as a very reliable car, there are reports of the cars lasting upwards of 200,000 miles, but there are a few things known to go out on vigors.  For one, the antenna stops going down all the way on some cars.  It usually happens because it is dirty and there is stuff getting in the mechanism.  Acura says that you shouldn't put WD40 or other lubrication on it if this happens.  Also, the display of the DSP am/fm/tape player in 92 and 93 models goes out quite often (mine was out when I got it) and you can only see what station you're playing some of the time.  A few people have had their fan blower motor go out and it is something like $800 to get to it and fix it.
