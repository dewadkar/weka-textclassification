            If you are shopping for a digital camera, take a good close look at the Sony Mavica FD-83.  When we were trying to decide which brand to buy, we did alot of internet investigation, reading reveiws, and checking prices vs. quality.  When we came to the Mavica FD-83, we did not find a single review that wasn't 100% pro buying it. So, we ordered one.

One of the biggest features in making our choice was the fact that instead of a memory card, it uses floppy disks.  CHEAP floppy disks!  And, you don't have to plug the camera into your computer to download, you simply pop in the disks to remove the photos, leaving the camera free to continue to shoot. We were taking great photos with this camera as soon as we got the battery charged--I had my first photos on line within 3 hours of receiving it.  Using the highest resolution you get about 4 photos to a disk, but it's no problem, you just pop in a new disk and keep shooting-no plugging it into the computer to download, on low setting we get about 6-8 photos generally to a disk.

 The camera feels good in the hands, the instructions are easy to understand, but for most functions you won't need to read them.   When a disk is full, you simply use your floppy drive to download the photos to whatever editing software you like best, they even include one in the package.  No hooking up your camera to cables to download, tying it up for hours while you download photos, and no buying expensive extra memory packs.  If you travel like we do, this is a BIG feature, you don't have to cart along a laptop to store photos while you take more, simply load up on re-usable floppies!  Then, unless you want to save them indeffinatly, you can re-format the flopy and use it over and over again.  Since we use most of our photos for our website, we don't need to keep them, so just re-use our disks over and over again.

Another feature which may or may not be important to you (depending on the type of photos you take) is that it has both automatic as well as through the lens focusing.  This means that if you are taking a photo of something really small (it has fantastic zoom capabilities), you can MAKE the camera focus on the small item, rather than the large background, which it would tend to do if you had it set to auto-focus. (you know, like when you are taking pictures of someone, and the HUGE tree behind them is in focus, and they are blurred?)

This camera has abilities that we haven't even tried out yet, but it's nice to know they are there--like micro focusing for little things, special settings for light, special affects like sepia tone, b &amp; w, haze, etc.  You could spend hours playing around with all the extras it offers. The lcd screen on the back for setting up your photo is clear and large, even on sunny days you have a clear image of your shot.

Recently, we were at a local Best Buy shoping for phone equipment, and I stopped to ask the salesperson in the camera/phone department where we would find them. A customer was shopping for a digital, and I recommended the Mavica.  The salesperson tried to talk him out of it, (and into a cheaper one, if you can beleive that-a salesperson trying to talk a buyer DOWN in price?)stating that the photo quality from the disk cameras was not nearly as high as that of the memory card cameras, and that if he wanted photo quality pictures, he needed to go to another brand.  Well, let me tell you, we have printed out many of the images from our Mavica, on photo-quality paper from our Cannon BJC-6000 printer, and they look just as good as any photo taken with a regular camera. I can't spot any difference. If you want samples of the photos, visit our website at www.designsbydeb.com, most of the photos of my jewelry(amulet bags and beadwork) were taken with this camera.

  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, solid, easy to use digital!  One note--invest in the longer-life battery, while the one that comes with it is fine, on a trip you would really want more time before you had to re-charge.  The one we found at Fry's Electronics ran about $50.  It may also get more photos onto a disk at the lowest resoluton settings--I don't know, we are so happy with the quality at the higher resolutions, and floppies are so inexpensive (and once you download the photos you simply re-format-which you can do with the camera, or your computer- and shoot the disk again)--why settle for poor quality?  At highest resolution they are as crisp and clean as any images I have gotten from my Nikon 35mm SLR.<br><br>
