            I've had the opportunity to own a '91 Ford Explorer, a '94 Chevy Suburban, a '98 Toyota 4Runner and a '98 Lexus LX450.  The 4Runner is far and away the best SUV I've ever owned or driven.  It has superior handling, a teriffic suspension and gets great mileage.  I'd recommend it to anyone who needs the power and space of an SUV with the reliability of a time-tested vehicle.

For reference, I own a '98 4Runner SR5 2WD with the upgraded engine option.


PROS
----

Great Handling
--The 4Runner has great handling and steering control.  The wheel is easy to handle, and it provides for a great driving experience.

Good Mileage
--Even in the city, in Houston, I typically got around 15 miles to the gallon, on regular unleaded.  This was pretty nice, considering I used to do a lot of driving.

Cleans up Easily
--I've taken my 4Runner camping many a time, and the darn thing refuses to stay dirty.  I've had a nasty, muddy tent thrown in the backseat.  I have cloth seats, and a vacuum took the dried mud right out.  It's great, and it cuts down on the expenses even more.

Large Cargo Area
--The Cargo Area in the back is large enough to fit large boxes, or other unwieldy items.  The roof rack also has multiple supports and ribs to make it capable of storage as well.

CONS
----

I thought about this for almost an hour.  I honestly can't think of one thing that I don't like about my 4Runner.  I love it that much.


OVERALL
-------

It's a great SUV for all-around usage.  It's good for city use, as well as backwoods hauling.  Either way, I'd recommend it to anyone who requires the services of a reliable SUV in a mid-size package.<br><br>
