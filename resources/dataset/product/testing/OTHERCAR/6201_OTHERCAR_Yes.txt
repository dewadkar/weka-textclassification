            <b>My Use</b>
I purchased this camera fall of 2003.  I have taken a couple thousand pictures printed out hundreds of them.  I have printed anything from 4x6 - 8.5x11 photos.
<p>
<b>My Experience</b>
The digital Zoom tends to create blurry pictures, don't use it.  The included memory card is only 16M, I replaced mine with a 128M and it seems adequate holding about 100  4MP photos.  I never found the bundled software useful (I don't have the easy dock option) so I wouldn't recommend using it.  I recommend buying a USB Compact Flash reader that will map the memory card as its own drive.  For the most part, this camera auto senses settings (ISO Speed/etc) correctly.
<p>
<b>My Results</b>
Most of my pictures have come about very nice looking and very printable.  The pictures were clear the color bright an accurate.  It is like any 35mm/film camera, the better the conditions (light/motion) the better the results.
<p>
<b>Usable Features</b>
The problem with most cameras is they are too complicated to use.  They have too many complex features that makes the camera unusable.  Here are some of the features this camera makes easy to use
 - Composite video out cable to view pictures on most TVs
 - Slide Show
 - Adding/Removing pictures from camera
 - Copy pictures from camera flash to computer
 - Maintain camera, add/remove memory battery
<p>
<b>I recommend this camera for anyone converting from 35mm to digital.</b>  When using this camera, the conversion couldn't be made easier.
