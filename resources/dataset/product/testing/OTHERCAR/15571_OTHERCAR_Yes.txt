            When looking for an SUV last year we compared dollar to dollar all the current models and makes at that time.  We went out and physically checked them all out and test drove all the models that compared price wise.  When we did this we already were leasing a 96 Chevy Tahoe and definitely knew that we didn't need or want another one of those at that time. 

 The Montero Sport luxury model came so well equipped for the money that it warranted a second look and when we took that look we were amazed at the fit and finish of the vehicle.  It was made very well compared to the fit and finish that we saw on all the other vehicles in it's price range.  The vehicle also had more  conveniences built in for both the driver and the passengers than any of the others. 

 It handles much better than some of the rest and for a 6 cylinder it has plenty of power on the open road.  It still has a little bit of a rocky ride, but not as much as some of the others.  In it's size group it is very roomy and we are large people. 

 We traveled to the Carolina's for a week and found this to be both economical on gas along with very comfortable to travel with.  We are leasing this vehicle and after this first year we have not had one mechanical problem with it.  The warranty package that comes with the vehicle has no competition from any of the American models.

  All of the options that are on the others were standard equipment on this vehicle. We had nothing to add as far as options, because at that time I don't believe there was any left to consider.  We intend to keep this vehicle and would highly recommend this to anyone as both a luxury vehicle along with the benefits of the extra carrying and for the 4 wheel drive.   <br><br>
