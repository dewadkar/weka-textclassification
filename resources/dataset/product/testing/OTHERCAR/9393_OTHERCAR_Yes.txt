            I purchased my 1999 VW Jetta nearly a year ago and I absolutely love it.  I purchased the 4 cylinder GL, and, while I also test drove the 6 cylinder, I felt that the 4 was plenty.  I have excellent pick up and I'm glad I went with 4 given the price of gas today!!  The bumper to bumper warranty is only 2 years/24,000, but I paid a little extra to extend it to 80,000...I would highly recommend doing this.  I believe it cost me an additional $1100.  The car is very fun to drive and comes with many outstanding standard features...alarm system (which will get you a discount on your insurance!), anti-lock brakes, and a full spare.  Before my Jetta, I had an Accord.  While I enjoyed my Accord, the Jetta is much more fun to drive and much more sporty.  All in all, the Jetta is a great car in the mid-size range.  For the price, you can't beat it!  Go for it!<br><br>
