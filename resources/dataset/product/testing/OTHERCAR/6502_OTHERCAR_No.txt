            When we first got the camera it was great. All the functions could easily be figured out even without the instruction manual. It holds about 8 pictures in its memory and then you have to go and buy a $30-$60 memory card. The memory card is reusable after download and holds anywhere from 50-170 pictures give or take a few. It seems fairly simple to download on the computer with the 'boat'. The boat is what it is sitting on in the picture and is not included with the camera. It was about $80. We ended up spending alot more than we planned on the camera with all the extra's we didn't realize we needed. This is all okay though. Then the horror - the camera broke -we have no way to download our pictures or take more. The bad part is NO ONE seems to know how to fix it. And KODAK is not helping matters.The camera itself is great but BEWARE for the service if you ever need it. You will not be helped.
