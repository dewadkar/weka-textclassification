            I purchased my Stratus used in 1996 from a reputable dealer.  I was looking for a reliable, roomy car and this was my first &quot;real&quot; car purchase.  
     The car has had it's share of breakdowns and quirks (now at 82,000 miles), including a new transmission, head gasket, coil pack replacement, squeaky rear doors and right turns.  The repairs and maintenance have always been performed promptly - I'd say that the dealerships are more responsible for frustrations than the car. I purchased an extended warranty, which I do NOT recommend...  It did not cover any of my repairs, for one reason or another and was not worth the paper it was printed on.
     I am disappointed in the rapid depreciation, but since I plan on driving it for at least another 20,000 miles it's not a huge deal.  I could sell my car, with all the options and high miles, in good condition for less than $5,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.
     The car is roomy compared to others in it's price range and easy to operate and care for.  The instrument panel is well designed, but the plastic dash material is aesthetically unappealing to many people.  I also like the mileage - I average 25-28 mpg.
     Overall, I think I got a fair deal.
