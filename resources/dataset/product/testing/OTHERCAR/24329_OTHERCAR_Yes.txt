            Back in Aug 99 I had gotten an outside sales job and the 87 Ford Ranger I had would not work for this job, so I set out to look for a new set of wheels.  My friend worked at a local dealership and decided to keep his eye open.  Well then the perfect car came in it was 91 Buick Regal limited with the 3800 v6 engine, grand touring suspension, air, tilt, cruise, power seat, power windows, and locks, and a cd player, and don't forget keyless entry.  Here is the best part it only had 75000 miles on it and I only had to pay 3500 for the car what a steal.

Well it is now 2002 and I have been nothing but pleased with this car, it has never let me down or left me stranded. Only things I have had to do to it in 3 years is I replaced the original battery in 2001 and then this year I had to replace the alternator but other than that it has just been routine maintenance.  The car was the perfect car for an outside salesperson, somehow I think Buick designed it for that purpose.  The ride is superb, the handling is a little boat like, but hey its a Buick not a sports car. Only con I have with the car is the odometer, it broke not long after I got it, but from talking to others, their's did the same thing.

The best thing I love about this car is first the engine it has tons of power, and when you punch it you will go.  I also love the ride it is sure nice on long trips.  Another plus that I love is the mileage, I get about 25 around town pretty steady, then on the highway I average around 28-32 no joke.  My wife and I went on vacation last year and twice on our trip we got 32mpg.  In closing if you need a solid car for your family, or just for yourself, this is the car if I had to do it over I would by this car again. Like I said it was the best 3500 I ever spent, and I will keep it till it dies, which will probably be along time from now.
