            The flagship of the Nissan fleet, the Maxima is the most drivable car I've driven.  Its power steering responsively guides the car as the robust engine quietly does its work.  The electronic fuel injection system is sophisticated and effective.

<b>Best Value</b>

This was the best value I found after hunting through some dozen dealerships in August of 1997: I received this close to 70,000 miles used car for about 1/2 the price of a new one.  I would've been satisfied with a junker that moved, but this was quite a deal.

When I test-drove it, I hardly knew the engine was on because it was SO quiet.  The sensitive steering wheel bent to slight and subtle provocation.  The accelerator added juice to the engine without much effort at all.  By contrast, other cars I've driven have stiff accelerators that require comparatively heavy pressing for much acceleration at all.

<b>Loaded</b>

I'm thankful too for the CD player, cruise control, adjustable, leather seats, rear defrost, power windows, power steering, electronic air conditioning, sun-roof, and other features.  Not all of these features, however, are standard.  Thus, one should check which of these features would be included in the particular Maxima one is looking at.  This particular car though is loaded, and I have definitely used all of these features.   Especially on long trips (such as from Illinois to Colorado to Washington), things like cruise control come in quite handily.

<b>Safety and Near-Death Experience</b>

This Maxima has airbags on both sides of the front of the car.  The Maxima is not flimsy.  I would even say that it is fairly solid as far as safety features.  At the same time, it's not in the same league as a Volvo.

During the summer of 2001, my family (parents, sister and niece) and I nearly died in this Maxima.  Going north on Interstate 5 on the west coast, we were driving in the right lane of a two-lane stretch.  

There was a double semi-truck in the exit lane.  Our car was next to the huge truck around the middle of it.  

Suddenly and without warning, the truck started swerving into our lane.  The truck did not turn on its left turn signal.  It must not have seen us as it made a snap decision to not exit after all.

In order to avoid getting crushed, I eased over to the left, just enough to not get smashed by the hulk of a truck.

Meanwhile, a Ford Mustang was speeding in the left lane.  It was going an estimated 75 miles per hour.  A high school junior was driving.

As it sped up from behind, it saw how the Maxima was gradually and minimally shifting left.  Since it was going too fast, she couldn't stop in time.

She veered to the left.  Suddenly a huge double semi-truck, the Maxima and Mustang were jockeying to stay alive in two lanes.  The Maxima was the meat in the sandwich.

The sparks flew as the Mustang grazed past the driver's side of the Maxima.  It left a big black streak along the driver's side of the Nissan.

In those scant seconds and fraction of a second, the lives of my entire family was hanging in the balance.  The great handling and maneuverability of the Maxima was tested to the max.

During this whole time, it seemed like time was moving in slow motion.  I had a sense that God's peace was, figuratively speaking, lifting me above the crisis.

Nobody was hurt at all;  it was good encouragement to re-evaluate our lives and thank God.

<b>Stalwart</b>

Nissans have a reputation for hardiness and endurance.  Although my particular one has had its alternator replaced, it is presently running quite well.  I know of multiple Nissan owners that have their Nissans run for over 200,000 miles.

Gas mileage is pretty good, although one can definitely find sprightlier cars with better mileage.  This Maxima has delivered in the mid-30 miles per gallon range.

<b>The 1st and Best</b>

This is the first car that I have ever owned.  A family friend had highly recommended the Maxima, and I eventually came to agree with him.  I say eventually because I tried and looked at Hondas, Volvos, Fords, Toyotas, and others.  I came very close to settling on a Honda Accord (which my parents purchased before and are very good in their own right), but a deal was narrowly averted.  I'm glad because the Maxima deal was the better (and best) value that I found.

An analogous car (although some may disagree) is the best-selling Toyota Camry.  The Maxima and Camry are in a similar (if not same) class as far as type of car, price-range, quality, etc.

<b>In Sum</b>

The Maxima has been quite satisfactory and was much more than I was expecting.  Its popularity is justified and I highly recommend it to those wanting a very good sedan.  It may even help spare your life!
