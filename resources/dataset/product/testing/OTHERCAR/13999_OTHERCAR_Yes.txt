            My firs car was a Honda.
Today I drive a Honda accord 95 V6
It is the most expensive edition. A dream to drive. But I had major problems with the transmission. The car was regularly maintained/checked by a Honda dealer. At around 92 000 miles the transmission broke down. Unexpected no warnings signs before the transmission blocked the wheels and broke down.
Replacement transmission at the dealer $ 4.000
I got a used one at a car shop for 1.500
I contacted the Honda of America in Los Angeles. If the would do a good will replacement since the car was regularly scheduled. The person who wrote me back from Honda, did not even took the time to write a normal business letter, each time he wrote me he was using copy and past options from his pre saved database.

Nice Cars, but the Honda customer service cannot represent their company image to loyal customers. Short time thinking!
