            I have a 1992 Paseo that I adore.  It takes $10 worth of gas to fill up and I can travel from Kentucky to Tennessee and back on one tank.

I have had my car for 5 years now and I have never had any problems with it.  (knock on wood)  Even though it is small it provides a smooth ride.

I did have a slight difficulty maintaining the original hubcaps on the wheels.  They fell off numerous times.  However after I bought a new set 3 years ago everything was fine.

The trunk doesn't hold much so I advise anyone looking in to purchasing a Paseo not to expect to travel with a lot of luggage.  If you lay the back seat down you do get a little extra room.

Also, it is not a good idea to put tall people in the back seat.  The window is dome shaped and it is easy to bump your head.

Overall my car has treated my excellent as have all Toyotas I have owned.<br><br>
