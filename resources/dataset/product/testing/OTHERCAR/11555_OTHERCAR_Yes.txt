            When looking for a replacement vehicle for my totaled Mazda 626, my wife and I were not in agreement.  I wanted a truck, with an extended cab, so I could haul all those purchases from Home Depot for home improvement and my wood-working hobby.  She, on the other hand, wanted a car, since our 16-year old daughter would likely be driving the vehicle each day to school and we still had to be able to haul around most of our five kids!

We compromised by buying the 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4WD.

I've been a Ford owner for most of my life.  I've tended to shy away from GM products and would never consider anything from Chrysler.  Seems I'm getting <i>less</i> set in my ways as I get older.  Anyway, I digress.  I've only had the Jeep for a couple of weeks, but <b>I LOVE IT</b>.  The ride isn't as smooth as a minivan or car, but I didn't expect it to be.  I like the ground clearance and I like the handling.  I've heard of safety concerns, but I <i>feel</i> safer in the Jeep than I did in the Mazda.  I like the 4.0-liter engine, which gets up and goes whenever I ask it to.  I like the price, which is sure better than the usual SUV sticker.

So far, the only things I don't care for are as follows:

1. Back seat: the doors are small and it's hard to get in and out; there's not a lot of room (I'm 6"1", so don't sit behind me), but enough for our youngest three.  The lack of head rests in the back worries me a bit if we were to get rear-ended and have adults in the back seat at the time.

2. Spare tire: I think ours is not a full-size, which is okay, since the tire is in the cargo area and takes up enough room.  I wish they had an optional cable hook-up underneath (like I had on my Ford Club Wagon) so you could put the spare under there instead.

3. Headlights: it's hard to tell if they are on at night, since they don't seem very bright.  Of course, sitting up higher off the ground could explain why they don't seem as bright.  When you're lower, you notice the reflection from the pavement a lot more.

I purchased the vehicle used (just this month - January '02) from CarMax and bought a 48,000-mile/48-month extended warranty, so I'm not concerned about repairs.

I've got all the amenities I want (no CD player) and I know I can't haul 4x8 sheets of lumber (except on top), so I'm happy.  I like the rugged good looks, which I find more appealing than the <i>foo-foo<i> SUVs out there (don't worry if you own one of them - I'm just jealous that I can't afford one!).

If anyone knows where I can get some running boards, I'd be interested to hear.  It doesn't seem Jeep makes the basic Cherokee any more.
