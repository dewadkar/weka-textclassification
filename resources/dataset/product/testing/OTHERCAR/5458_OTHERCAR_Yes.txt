            I've had my Integra for over a year now. It's a base model (SE/LS) automatic and I do miss the power door locks that my previous cars had. I was trying to decide between a Civic Coupe Si (sports model, fully loaded) and the base Integra. They both came out to almost the same price after taking the financing rate into account. It's the test drive which helped me make up my mind. The Integra is way more fun to drive and you definitely feel a difference between the two. I also test drove a Protege and a Sentra and though I know they're not in the same class, the difference was pretty noticeable in terms of handling.

Technical Specs (Integra SE/LS):
-----------------
Base Engine:         1.8 L 4L DOHC 16 Valves 
HP (hp@tr/min):      140 @ 6300
Torque (lb.ft@min):  124 @ 5200 Drivetrain front-wheel drive
Brakes (front/rear): 4-wheel disc (no ABS in base model)
Power Steering:      Std
Ground Clearance:    5.9 in
Turning Circle:      34.8 ft. 
Fuel Tank Capacity:  13.2 gal.
Fuel Efficiency:     25 mpg city/ 31 mpg highway 


Pros:
-------
- Sporty, REALLY FUN to drive (even though it's an automatic)
- Handles great at curves and at high speeds
- Looks great
- Gives good gas mileage for a sports car(it was just a little worse than a Civic)
- Good sound system, A/C.
- Adjustable lumbar support on drivers side. Seats are quite comfortable but after a 5 hour ride can feel not so cushy!
- The hatchback is VERY convenient for carrying things. I've been able to get in almost twice as much stuff as I would have had in a regular car.
- If you're not usually more than 2 people, the interior room is enough.
- I've had no trouble with it yet. I have a friend who has a 1995 Integra (the model hasn't changed since then) and she's had no problems other than a rusty antenna - so this is a pretty reliable car as well (I have heard this from other owners too). Acura is the luxury line of Honda - I guess it shows.

Cons:
-------
- Tight for a tall person or if you plan on having more than 2 people in it on a regular basis.
- Can get a little noisy on the highway
- Because it rides low and has a stiff suspension you feel the bumps more (but it is a sports car after all!)
- Insurance is quite high
- Has a tight back space. This, combined with the fact that it is lower than most cars, makes it hard for older people to get out.
- Only seats 4
- Rear view is smaller than most cars and takes some getting used to. It is still better than most sports cars out there.

The bottom line:
------------------
I wouldn't recommend buying this car if you have more than 2 people travelling in it on a regular basis (unless you have your heart set on a coupe in which case I guess it doesn't make a difference). But, If you're looking for a fun, sporty car that isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg, this is your car.
