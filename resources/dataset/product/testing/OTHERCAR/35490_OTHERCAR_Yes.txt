            Synopsis:  

I can�t think of a better minivan.  It is as smooth and comfortable as any Honda.  Perfect for a family or anyone who needs the space.  After a few years of the original ill-designed Odyssey, Honda really hit it out of the ball park with this one...if you don't get jealous of all the over-the-top luxury of top American models.  

Specs:  

3.5L 24-valve V6, 4-speed automatic, traction control, power everything + side doors, premium CD, dual-zone/rear climate control, etc. 

Design/Practicality:  

It�s near perfect.  Having spent a lot of time in the very first mini-vans (ah, the Plymouth Voyager from 1985 � light blue with woodgrain &lt;sigh&gt;), this seems to be a whole new breed.   Like many recent Honda�s, the interior is a bit sparse.  You have to look carefully to make sure all the buttons and options are there.  It�s not as sparse/minimalist as the newest Civic�s, but it�s up there.  The center dash controls can be far for some people, but there are redundant radio controls on the steering wheel and most people tend to leave the climate control on �auto� anyway.  The seats are firm, but well cushioned � typically different in that Japanese firm vs. American soft kind of way.  The second-row seats are light and easy to remove and the third row disappears into the floor.  Very nice.  Our �99 didn�t have GPS, leather, or a flip-down LCD entertainment system, but it�s nicely outfitted.  Overall, it definitely feels less overtly luxurious than a Windstar SEL or a Town &amp; Country.  They really feel and ride like limousines and feel remarkably plush.  I feel that the Odyssey really targets a different, more import-minded audience � there are definitely more on both coasts than in the Midwest.  

Basically, if your other car is, say, a Lumina, Taurus, or a Town Car, you'd be more comfortable in the plushness of a domestic. If you've been driving Camry's, Accord's, and Q45's, the Honda would just feel more natural.

Driveability:  

It�s just like a much bigger Accord.  It feels tighter and smaller than it really is � which can occasionally cause a rear wheel to hop a curb or similar misjudgements; however, the progressive power steering makes it a breeze to park and handle well on the highway, tracking better at speed than any minivan I�ve driven.  The engine is the smoothest minivan engine I�ve experienced.  It�s is virtually vibration and noise free at idle � you have to be careful not to engage the ignition again once the engine is on.  MPG fluctuates � it seemed to do better in the warmer seasons and has dropped a bit this winter.   

Quality/Maintenance:  

Along with the much more expensive and smaller Toyota Sienna, it probably sets the standard.  No mechanical or minor quality problems � totally squeak and rattle free after 20K miles.  The maintenance costs and schedule are pretty much on par with any other minivan.  

Buying a used one?  

I don�t see many around, but suspect they command a premium.  I�ve always been suspicious of too many power accessories and the dual power doors make me nervous.  They sound expensive to repair, but they�ve been fine so far.  Like any other Honda, it should be a prime used car buy.  <br><br>
