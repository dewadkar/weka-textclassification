            This was the one of the last years for the Dynasty, a mid-sized front wheel drive car by Dodge.  This 1993 model was my late mother-in-laws.  We bought it from her estate and it has been a great car, ever since.

Ours is the upscale model, with a small piece of Vinyl roof covering over the back 1/4 of the roof.  It has a 6 Cyl. engine that is very powerful and is only noisy when strong acceleration is needed (passing gear etc...)

Our car has AT Overdrive, AC and heat both work well, AM-Stero, FM Stereo/Cassette (with automatic track skip and reverse).  Power Seats make it a pretty comfortable ride.  The two front cupholders are built into the armrests and are useful.  The view out of the back could be lots better, and the side mirrors are very small.  <br><br>
