            My mom bought the 1996 Chevy Lumina a while back as a step up from our small Plymouth Reliant. The Reliant was reliable, but getting on in years, since it was an 1988 and it was currently 1997. So, we scouted out some cars and chose the Lumina.

The car is aesthetically beautiful. We got it with most of the wanted features, including the AM/FM/tape deck stereo, air, power steering, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, but no ABS. In the long run, the ABS would've probably made insurance slightly cheaper. 

The car runs well, even as it makes its way to four full years of service. She has been extremely reliable. No towing to a repair station has been necessary although there was one incident, and only one, where the car died in transit. It was a simple repair, and at a few hundred, the most expensive thing done to the car. 

The V6 engine purrs, but for my taste, it does not accelerate fast enough. I hate having to push the accelerator that hard to get immediate results. It is sometimes hard to judge in parking, as it may seem like a big car while inside it, but is a normal mid-size sedan. 

The trunk is large enough that you can go to the Price Club and fill it up easily with room left over. It pains me to say that the back seat is more roomier than the Ford Taurus. Of course, I still love my 93 Ford Taurus more! :)

But where it has extra room, the front seat is noticeably more cramped than in the older Taurus. The driver's seat in the Lumina has a switch to lean it back, which the Taurus doesn't, but the Taurus seat, if equipped with it, has power in it too. Just move the switch on the side of the car to get your results!

She is an overall good car, and has a good top speed. It's the average cost for the average midsize sedan. However, if you have slightly more meat on the bones than the national average, perhaps the Lumina may make you feel claustrophobic. <br><br>
