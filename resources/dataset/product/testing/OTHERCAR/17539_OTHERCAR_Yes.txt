            I bought a white 1990 Mitsubishi Montero about one month ago.  I love it so far.  It has about 107,000 miles on it and runs great.  I have had no problems with it yet, and don't foresee any problems.  It has the RS package on it, which I think is maybe a luxary edition.  The person before me put bigger tires and wheels on it.  The wheels look really nice.  They also put taillight gaurds, a winch, brushgaurd, and foglights on it, so as you can imagine, it looks awesome.  It has a ton of room in it and the seats are comfortable.  The only thing I was concerned about when I bought this vehical was a possible engine problem I have heard about.  But, no problems yet.<br><br>
