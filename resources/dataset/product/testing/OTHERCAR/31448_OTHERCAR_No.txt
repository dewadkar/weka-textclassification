            I did not care for the GMC Jimmy that we owned. The car's suspension I feel was to soft. Interior looked extremely cheap. Service at the GMC dealer was the worst of any vehicle I ever owned. GM paint quality still suffers. (look at any GM vehicle in parking lots)
No real mechanical problems though. The engine had plenety of power.
Off road riding, the car bounced around, and lost traction easily.
On road the car is smooth, and fast. The interior did not hold up well after a few years. The paint faded even though it was waxed and maintained. As I mentioned earlier, one just has to look at GM cars out in any parking lot and you sees peeling, chipped, and faded paint. Ther are several people who work at my office, and the paint on the hood of there cars is just about peeled off! What's up with that!

On a positive note - the airconditioner was powerful, the heater worked just as well. For everyday driving I suppose it is ok, but I do not feel it did well off road.
The power from the V6 HO 220 horsepower engine was it's best feature. <br><br>
