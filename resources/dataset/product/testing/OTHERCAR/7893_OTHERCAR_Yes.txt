            I researched on the net for what I was looking for. It took about a year. When I saw the <B>Canon A20</B>, I knew the search was over.

Here is what I was looking for:
USB Connectivity,
JPEG compression,
Multiple resolutions,
High Megapixel count,
CompactFlash or 3.5"FD storage media,
and a decent quality LCD viewing screen.

What I got was that and much more. The first thing you'll notice is how easy it is to use. Literally, turn it on and shoot (I guess that's why they call it "Point & Shoot"). The menu system is easy to understand and operate on the LCD panel. It takes some book reading to get all the symbols down, but that doesn't take long.

<B>Software</B>
The drivers and software load easily. When you connect the camera to download pictures, the software automatically starts, and previews your pictures. I do suggest obtaining a separate photo editing package if you are going to do anything more than cropping your pictures.

<B>Picture Quality</B>
The quality of these pictures is the best I've seen at 1600x1200. But watch out on the storage media - only about 11 shots. That's why I bought 2 extra 32MB CF cards, and use the lowest settings which are fine for my needs. Nothing fancy here, not even a shutterbug, just pictures and a computer fetish.

<B>Battery Life</B>
We had some trouble getting the battery life down at the beginning. They were going dead at about 15 shots. After messing with the resolution and compression settings we are much happier. We are going to invest in rechargeable batteries though, just don't see any reason to "waste" batteries.

<B>Accessories</B>
An 8MB CompactFlash Card is included, however I would suggest getting a higher capacity card. It does not come with a case, just a strap for the camera. As mentioned above, the software is just ok. There is a quite nifty photo album type package, with backgrounds, text, etc. Fun for the scrapbooking types. 

<B>Features:</B>
- USB Connectivity, and TV/Video out
- Multiple JPEG compression levels
- 1600x1200...1024x768...640x480 Resolutions
- 2.1 Megapixel
- 3x optical and 2.5x digital zoom
- 1.8" LCD screen
- 8 MB CompactFlash card
- Advanced features (above my head)

More features abound, however I am not practiced enough to take advantage of these. The functionality is there, the features are there. The only lacking points seem to be battery life and photo editing software.
