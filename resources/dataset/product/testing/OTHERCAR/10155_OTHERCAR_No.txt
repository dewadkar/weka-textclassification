              Ok you know that stupid commercial? The one where it starts &quot;What happens when a SUV is raised by a family of sports cars?&quot;  Well, the Pathfinder would be the retarded SUV-child of that family.
&lt;P&gt;
  Being on the market for an SUV, I turned to a Nissan dealer.  Having just finished driving a 1991 Pathfinder, and fully satisfied, it was only reasonable to assume that the new 2000 model would be better.  I was DEAD wrong.  If I were to compare my 1991 to a 2000 model, the 2000 would obviously be better.  But if I were to compare the 2000 Pathfinder with any other vehicle, the 2000 would come in last place.  Why? There are a few reasons.
&lt;p&gt;
1) Outside Engineering and design-  There were so many problems with the outside design.  The front headlights are arranged in such a way where the slightest bump jostles both headlights loose, I've already had to replace 2, at a cost of $500 each (Pep Boys). Secondly, the standard door runners (the things you step on to get into the car) are absolutely useless, they are so thin you couldn't step on them if you needed them. Believe me, many a friend have fallen and hurt some body part.  Don't remind me.  Lastly the thing I've hated in both models is the rear door and window, I never know which way to turn the key to open the window and which one opens the trunk, it's such a pain, there's not even a simple sticker!
&lt;P&gt;
2) Inside Engineering and design-  First, the cupholders, gosh dangit! it's right under the armrest, so where there's a passenger and a driver both with McDonald Super Extra Large drinks, only one fits, the second holder is jammed right under the armrest.  The CD Player is a wreck, if there's a CD in the player and I forget, I can place another CD on TOP of that and ruin the first initial CD, there should be some kind of security where only one cd can be placed in the player at a time. Also the seats do not push very far back at all, in fact, there is plenty of room in the back seats.  But what good is that? You got the noisy kids, and then you got the driver whose humping the steering wheel, you need to be able to schooch farther back! The seats are no work of art, in fact they are terrible, they have a stiff back to them and after a few hours you begin to form some strange bumps on your back.  And lastly, a pet peeve, the mud covers, they don't work, the instant you step on them you curl the edges, and it stays that way for life.  
&lt;P&gt;
3)Handling on road-  Handled ok, when I took some sharp turns I became a little frightened at the high weight shift.  But no harm there, the brakes were a little in the red zone taking a few more feet then usual to stop and the seatbelt kept jamming up on my chest.  Blinkers made the same boring sound (Just ONCE I've wanted to have some whacko blinkers that maybe don't blink in the same pattern) and the acceleration was about normal.  So handling was not bad.
&lt;P&gt;
Overall it's clearly visible that you could find a better car with better features and easier to use functions.  You might even be able to find a cheaper car with better handling.  But one thing is for certain, there is better out there.
