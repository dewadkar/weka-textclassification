            My wife and I bought a red SLE convertible for her in 2000.  It was a difficult car to find, and we ended up driving about 200 miles to pick it up.  We got a red with tan top.  We wanted the black top in the promotional literature, but the dealers claimed it was not an option.  We've since seen many with the black top, proving car dealers are often wrong and/or lying without any qualms once again.

<b>Performance</b>
The performance of this car is completely what is promised.  It is not phenomenal, but this is an automatic transmission japanese car, so it isn't going to ride like a porsche.  Acceleration is pretty good - more than adequate for merging on the highway etc.  It also has more than adequate high-end - it is easy to get near 100mph with no trouble.  Cornering leaves a little to be desired, but I think a lot of that is due to the stock wheels and (especially) tires.  The tires are prone to squealing very easily around corners that I don't consider too extreme.  I expect this is the sacrifice made to the more comfortable ride with high profile tires.

<b>Convertible Features</b>
The convertible top on this car works very well, with no leaks.  The wind direction is excellent at speed with the top down.  The aerodynamics work great to keep the breeze from being overwhelming.  The option to open and close the back windows is a nice addition; with all the windows up and the heat on it allows you to leave the top down as the weather drops in comfort.
The only issue with the top is the manual boot cover that snaps in place  after the top is raised or lowered.  That is a silly afterthought that just isn't going to happen.  Why would you have an electronic assist to drop the top, and then walk back there and tediously work all the snaps required to put the aesthetic boot in place?  It didn't take us long to relegate the boot cover to the garage.

<b>Reliability</b>
We haven't had any trouble with the car in 50k miles and 2 years.  

<b>Audio System</b>
The 6-cd in-dash changer is a good idea and well-executed.  There have been no problems with it.  The one issue that exists with the audio system is the bass response.  There is a subwoofer that seems to play at the same level regardless of the volume control.  This works well at high volume levels, but creates WAY too much of a boomy sound at low levels.

<b>Space and Practicality</b>
This is the roomiest convertible we have seen.  Two adults are more comfortable in the back of this car than in many small sedans.  The leather interior is very plush and well designed.  The trunk in this car is surprisingly large and useful, and is not impacted by the convertible top.  Two sets of golf clubs are no problem in the trunk.
