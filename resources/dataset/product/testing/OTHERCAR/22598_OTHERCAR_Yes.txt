            I bought this vechicle because I liked just about everything about this car.  The VR6 engine is silky smooth and will snap your head back at the stoplight or even cruising on the highway when you have to quickly overtake a car.  Handling is not as sporty as others because of the high center of gravity, but sporty enough for daily driving on the highways.  The styling is clean and unique... it doesn't look boxy, but yet, it's not the like the egg-shaped cars that are out there right now.  Sit inside, and you're surrounded with sporty and supportive leather seats with the best seat warmers around.  At night, turn on the lights, and the red on blue dash lights light up the cabin...  the color scheme is magnificent, probably the best color scheme around.  Cruise down the highway, and the 8 speaker, monsoon speaker system will just rock your world... the built in amp and the optional cd-changer (the only option for the car and an option I would recommend getting) provide endless hours of music enjoyment to accompany your driving pleasure.  Little gadgets like the self-dimming rear-view mirror, speed adjusting windshield wipers, the cupholders will awe the techno junkie in all of us.  

The dislikes are small.... There's not a lot of leg-room in the back to accommodate your friends, but I didn't buy the car for them, just for me and my girlfriend.  The radio reception isn't all that great either, but I listen to my cd's most of the time, so that's okay.  

Who should buy this vehicle?  Well... a person that enjoys a great sporty car with the influence of German engineering.  I've enjoyed the Honda Civic and Acura Integra in the past, but this time, I overlooked both cars to go for something different.  And I didn't regret my decision.  <br><br>
