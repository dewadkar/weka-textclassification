            This is my second Nissan Pathfinder.  I had a 1990, and now a 1999.5.  I feel safe on the road, it handles quickly and I always know what it will do.  I have had the 1999.5 for 13 months and have had absolutely no problems with it.  I had an emergency situation in which I had to pull off the road suddenly.  It was on a 45 degree incline.  The sudden pull off on that angle at 45 miles an hour scared me, but the Pathfinder held firm and stable.  There are so squeaks or other noises, it is a quiet, car like ride.  On the highway at highway speeds, it is a pleasure to drive.  In town, it handles well in traffic and has good stopping power.  I think I will buy a 2005 Pathfinder.<br><br>
