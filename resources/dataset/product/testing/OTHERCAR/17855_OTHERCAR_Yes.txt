            Older Blazers are better.  Period.  there is just no two ways about it when you are going off road.  I own a 1978 Chevy K5 4x4 Blazer.  It is great for a casual off-roader.  My personal favorite model of blazer is 1972.  These still have the classic styling of round fenders, and are much beefier than many of the mid 1980's Blazers.  From 1973 to to '75 blazers kept their full convertable tops.  This however sometimes leads to cracks above the rear windows due to the fact that the fiberglass does not flex with the body.  After 1975 until recently Blazers went virtually unchanged on the exterior.  However the drive trains were down-graded from a GM 12 bolt to a 10 bolt axle in the rear and from a Dana 44 to a 10 bolt in the front after 1979, making it more likely to break parts while off road.  Also in 1992 Gm started using an Independent Front Suspension (IFS) which many would agree hinder articulation when crawling over uneven terrain.  The only positive thing about newer blazers are their creature comforts.  They have more comfortable seats and are quieter, but to a true off roader these do not matter.  <br><br>
