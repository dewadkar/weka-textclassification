            I bought my used 1993 Subaru Impreza because at the time it was what I could afford. I had to have an all wheel drive vehicle due to the harsh winters. I bought it in 1994 and it had 8,000 miles on it. I have had my car for 5 years now and it now has 154,000 miles on it. I have had to have new brake pads, a battery, and tires replaced but that's all I've HAD to have replaced. I just had the timing belt changed because I got nervous. I don't take very good care of my car. I've had oil changes done between every 15 to 20,000 miles and literally no other routine maintenance done. This car is the best car I have ever bought. It drives well and handles perfectly in snow and on ice. We had a devastating ice storm 2 years ago and my car was about the only one to be able to make it back and forth to work. I have lost NO work days due to snow or ice. I would recommend a Subaru Impreza to anyone who wants a reliable car that will get you anywhere.<br><br>
