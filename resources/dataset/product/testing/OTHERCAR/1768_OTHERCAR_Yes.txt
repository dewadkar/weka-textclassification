            Well, the Sebring has been very nice to my family and I, so I dont have many comaplints there.
However, I do not know how many people have heard about the major recall of Chrysler Sebrings because their steering shaft may become corrupt and not work as well if even the slightest bump happens. Well...this happened to me.
Since it had just snowed, it was pretty icey outside, and when trying to manuever out of the driveway, we hit a tree. We hit a tree because the steering stopped responding.
This is a great luxury car, if you live somewhere where there is a single climate all year round, but if you need to drive in snow, then I dont reccommend this car.
Features are outstanding for the price!<br><br>
