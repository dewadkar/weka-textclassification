            I own a 1999 Honda Accord LX, 4-cylinder with a VTEC engine.
I bought it brand new w/ only 33 miles on it. I bought it when i was single and the minute i laid eyes on it, I LOVED IT! I was very close to buying a 99 Oldsmobile Alero, fully loaded, and i do mean FULLY, for the same price.  I went w/ my Accord. Why? The styling this car possesses just knocks the Alero out. Yes, I was giving up Alloy wheels, leather seats, sunroof and 4 doors...SO WhAT! I knew, in the long run, the Accord would prove to be much more car than the Alero.  And it has. In Sept of this year, my wife will be having our first baby.  Unfortunately, I will be forced to sell my Accord. There is absolutely no room for my two dogs and the baby in the back seat of my Accord.  Allow me to summarize for you my experience w/ this imported Beauty:
PROS:
&gt;&gt;This car is so freakin' reliable, it's scary. Except for its regularly scheduled oil changes and its every 15,000 mile maintenance, it has acted absolutely perfect. No joke.
&gt;&gt;This car is an eye-catcher. Its styling is unique, classy and simple.
&gt;&gt;This car has a very smooth ride w/ great suspension.
&gt;&gt;This car has a huge trunk.
&gt;&gt;Gas mileage is superb&gt;you will save lots of money at the pump
&gt;&gt;The radio and AC controls are easily accessible
&gt;&gt;There are no blind spots look out of the car
&gt;&gt;This car is very easy to park it tight spots

CONS:
&gt;&gt;It is highly reccommended that you have your Honda "tuned-up" every 15,000 miles by a Honda dealer.  Be prepared to pay anywhere between $300-$450 each time.
&gt;&gt;This car lacks room. I'm 5'10", 200 lbs and I'm barely comfortable.  My wife has no complaints.
&gt;&gt;Power steering is not the smoothest.
&gt;&gt;I'm at 48, 000 miles and I've had one brake lamp go out and both headlights go out, one twice. The beauty is there is an indicator near your odometer that will let you know when your lamps are out, great feature.
&gt;&gt;My clock light went out, never fixed it.  They told me they needed to open the dash board to get to it, didn't want to bother.  I just now can't see my clock at night.
&gt;&gt;I've made the mistake of playing the radio (10 minutes)while the car was not on, drained my battery very quickly. Waited about an hour, car started right back up. Dont do it.
&gt;&gt;When driving on the highway, wind can get pretty loud, drowning the music on the radio.  I've gotten used to raising and lowering the voluming quite often.
&gt;&gt;It's lost a little of its pep over these few years, but I still love my Honda Accord.
