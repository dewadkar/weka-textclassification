            If you are looking for a great, economical, sporty and reliable car, the Toyota Celica is a great choice.  I bought my 1998 Celica used last spring.  It had just 17,000 miles on it and was in excellent condition.  In the ten months I have owned it I have not had to bring it in for service once!  I have never had this experience with a used car before.  My Celica is the upgraded model with all the bells and whistles available for the 98 model year.  The dealer treated me well,and the car is perfect.  I expect that I will keep it quite a few years.  I am currently getting 23 to 25 miles per gallon,(my driving is mostly just around town) I did get 29 miles to the gallon on a long car trip recently.  I am very impressed with this vehicle.  I purchased a Toyota because of a similar experience with my husband's 1999 Rav 4.  It too is a pleasure to own. <br><br>
