            I owned my RAV/4 for close to three years before recently replacing it. I was originally looking for something that would be reasonably practical while still being fun to drive on my relatively lengthy commute.  The RAV/4 was an excellent choice.

Built on the same unibody frame as the Corolla, the RAV handles like a car, and a pretty nimble one considering the car's dimensions.  The feel of the drive is solid and comfortable, and the RAV takes corners at good speed without any feeling of roll or drift.  The handling is surprisingly good.

The interior is well-appointed, and the roomy bucket seats are very comfortable.  The rear seat can hold two quite comfortably, three a little less so.  The controls are generally well laid-out and easily accessible.  The indicators and gauges are large and easily readable.

There is a good amount of storage space in the back, and this can be expanded even further by folding up the rear seats, creating an area which would certainly be used to move the contents of a dorm room or small apartment.

Visibility is excellent, with large windows all around and a high driving position that provides an excellent view of the road.  The main deficiency seems to be the anemic 2.0 liter four-cylinder engine, which really doesn't have enough pep to get this car moving quickly, particularly with the four-speed automatic transmission.  The engine also tends to be on the noisy side, especially at higher revs.

Fit and finish are uniformly excellent, as one would expect on a Toyota.  The car was extremely reliable, and never required any unscheduled service in the more-than-three-years I owned it.

The engine compartment is astoundingly cramped, and some things, such as the oil dipstick, are poorly placed.  To check the oil, one has to reach over an extremely hot aluminum exhaust manifold; I singed myself more than once doing this.

Gas mileage is so-so, averaging 22 miles per gallon in a mix of highway and city driving.

This is a very good car if you want something with some of the hauling capacity of a small truck, but the driving feel of a car.  It's reasonably priced and a good value.<br><br>
