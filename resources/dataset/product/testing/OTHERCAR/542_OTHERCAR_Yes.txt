            I commute via subway to work, so I just needed an inexpensive small car for weekend errands. I bought a 2000 Accent GS a few weeks ago, and so far I really like it. 
I looked at the Ford Focus ZX3, and the Toyota ECHO before deciding on the  Accent. The Accent had more features for less, and I liked the Accent's styling. I disliked the ZX3's goofy dash, and the Echo's interior was very light gray, which would get dirty easy. The Echo comes too pared down, with similar options as the Hyundai, its thousands more, as is the Zx3. 
My Accent has A/C and an auto transmission.
The Accent handles very well, probably due to its small size. Its very agile in tight urban traffic, and its height gives good visibility. Its super easy to parallel park in small spaces.  The cargo area is quite large with the back seats folded, although I wish the seats folded flat. The factory stereo cassette isn't that bad, but I plan to upgrade the speakers and get a CD player someday. Don't get the factory CD, its not worth the money. You would do better to get an aftermarket CD from Circuit  City or similar. 
The A/C blows really cold, which is surprising on a car with a not so powerful engine. 
The controls and dash are simple and logical, everything is where you would expect it to be. The glove box is larger than usual.
Although it accelerates well at slow speeds, its pokey on the highway.
You aren't going to pass anyone quickly. The speedometer goes up to 130, a bit of wishful thinking on Hyundai's part. 

If you live in a large urban area, where parking is tight, and you don't care too much about engine power, the Accent is a great choice. 
If you live in a more suburban setting, where space is not a premium, consider a bigger car like the Hyundai Elantra, Honda Civc, or the Ford Focus sedan.
