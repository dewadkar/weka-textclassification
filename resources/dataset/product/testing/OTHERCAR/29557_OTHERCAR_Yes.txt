            Oh sure, we all want a Viper.  I wouldn't turn my nose up at a Corvette, either.  On the other hand, I'm not rich, so when I went out to find something insanely fast, I gravitated toward the Dodge Stealth.

Of course, if you don't want a used car, look somewhere else - they stopped making these in 1996.  The car was actually built by Mitsubishi (sister to the 3000GT), but Dodge designed their own exterior for their version.  In my humble opinion, the Stealth is quite the better looking of the two.

Now, you want to be careful as you roam the used car lots - there's many different varieties of these cars.  Being poor, I wound up with the first model year, 1991.  In that year, you had your basic 161 hp SOHC V6 Stealth, your DOHC 222 hp V6 Stealth ES, and your 300 hp Twin Turbo DOHC V6 all wheel drive, all wheel steering Stealth RT.  Naturally, I went with the latter.  In 1994, a 320 hp V6 was introduced, so if you want the best, you've got to get the newer one.  One nice design decision with these cars was that the Twin Turbos only had standard transmissions, so you don't have to worry about seeing that nice clean car and turning it down because of the 4 speed.  The manual transmission is a must with these cars, not only for the sheer fun of it, but to get the mileage to respectable levels as well.

I assume that this is a fast car, but I'm not sure.  See, I don't think I've ever pressed the pedal all the way to the floor - I push it halfway down and I'm always speeding before I can shift to second.  Naturally, speeding is highly illegal, and oh-so-dangerous, so you'll have the most fun taking 90 degree corners at 40 mph, just because you can.  The AWD means never having to say you're sorry for spinning your wheels - it's almost impossible to do so.

Inside, it's small, but cozy.  You'll want to make sure you don't hit anything - that airbag isn't going to keep your head from going through the roof.  The CD player is rock-solid, and hasn't skipped yet.  The audio system is excellent, bathing you in make-your-ears-bleed sound for when you're in a bad mood and you've got your Suicidal Tendencies CD handy.  The seats are even comfortable, and the AC is cold and crisp.

All this comes at a price, of course.  The purchase price isn't what you need to worry about - since they're all used, the prices are low.  No, you need to worry about your insurance, which will likely go through the roof.  Still, it will probably be less than newer, more expensive hot rods.  Be sure to check with your insurance company before buying to make sure you can afford it, and have a VIN number handy.  Those insurance company folks will give you a nice low quote, and then triple it when they find out it's a twin turbo.

There are some reliability issues.  My cousin's Stealth blew up while he was driving through the desert.  It's an interference design, so if your timing belt goes, you get to buy a new engine.  The tires wear out quickly, especially on the back wheels, which are cambered outward, and they'll run you a cool $150 each.

All this, though, is what you get with a sports car.  For the speed demon on a budget who still values looks, the Stealth is hard to beat.<br><br>
