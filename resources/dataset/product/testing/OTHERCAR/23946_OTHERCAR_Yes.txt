            We just got this car and I don't mind being the first to review it.  We drove an old LX450 and it was beginning to show its age (see my other review).  Thus, a trip to the Lexus dealership seemed eminent.  I knew right when I saw this automotive creation it was going home with me.  The blizzard pearl LX470 is simply a pretty car (I will refer to the LX470 as a car).  Right when you see its soft, elegant shape outlining the most satisfying "white" you've ever seen, you can't help but be intrigued.  The interior is as elegant as the exterior.  The leather is of highest quality and the wood trim/modern interior is pleasing to the eye.  The seats are supremely comfortable, manifest on long journeys, and supportive.  The ride is comfortable and adjustable.  There are four settings.  The new 5 speed automatic transmission is smooth and confident.  I especially enjoy sliding the shifter to 4 while passing slumbering vehicles on the road.  What a difference that is!  The 4 wheel disc brakes are strong and more than adequate for this 5,600 pound behemoth.  The 2003 boasts numerous safety features not seen on previous models.  Electronic Brake Distribution, Vehicle Skid Control, Side Air Bags, Roll Sensing Curtain Airbags, Sophisticated Night Vision, and Fog beams to name a few.  If you are looking for a luxury car with an attitude and have $67,000 to spare, check out the LX470, you will not be disappointed.
