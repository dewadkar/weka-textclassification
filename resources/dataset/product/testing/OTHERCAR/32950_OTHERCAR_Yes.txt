            I have owned 2 Jeep�s (98-5.9 Fast! 88-4.0) and now 2 Land Rovers (88 classic and 97 4.6HSE) amongst other cars.  I can say that for on and off road performance and comfort the 4.6 takes the cake!  The 4.0 Jeep was very economical for parts and fuel and it was very impressive off road but lacked space.  The 5.9 was very fast but had too much torque to go many places off pavement.  Surprisingly it lacked rear leg room and cargo space!  The 88 Range Rover had plenty of cargo space and handled very well off road but swayed bad at freeway speeds.  You could get used to the swaying but it also lacked power.  It was so heavy and would take time to get up to speed.  

Once I drove the 97 4.0 I fell in love with its space and comfort.  There was plenty of room in the back for camping gear and strollers. The rear legroom actually made me feel short!  The adjustable ride height is great for toddlers to get in and out and offers plenty of articulation off road.  It drove real nice and cornered well without lean!  At last I had found my car, but it still seemed quite weak�    After searching for a 4.6 to test drive I found the one I bought.  All in all it took me 16 months to find the right Land Rover.  The 4.6 has a noticeably more powerful power-band.  The passing power is well worth the extra $$$.  I have really enjoyed my 4.6 and have taken it off road many times with no trouble.  Even though it is spacious and heavy I have never felt like I was in a Suburban.  It is always a pleasure to drive�
