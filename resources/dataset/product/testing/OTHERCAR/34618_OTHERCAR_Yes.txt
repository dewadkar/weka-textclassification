            The one thing about the Legacy Sedan that really got my attention was its performance in the rain and snow.  All wheel drive and the tight steering really make you feel that you have total control over the vehicle, even in terrible driving conditions.  I bought the Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT with a moonroof and spoiler, and it really looks flashy, but not too ostentatious.  Safety has always been a primary concern with me when it comes to cars, and the Legacy Sedan really puts me at ease.  Though this vehicle does not always get the best mileage in a city setting, I am willing to compromise this since it is such a safe car.<br><br>
