            I've owned a white, four door, 1994 Buick LeSabre for nearly eight years. It is the second Buick made car which my family has owned. Overall, the LeSabre is a sound, well made car. It is a sturdy and a versatile car, suitable for both basic travel needs, such as getting to and from work, or for long family trips on the open road. 

The Buick LeSabre has some wonderful features which initially  sold me on purchasing the car. It has power steering and brakes, anti lock brakes, dual air bags (which is sometimes a worry for me, being on the short side), comfortable, plush interior seats which are also four way adjustable seats for people of varying heights (a nice convenience if several people are sharing the car), a roomy back seat, air conditioning, and a great sounding radio system with a tape deck.

The car handles well on the road and is absolutely super on gas mileage. I mainly use my car for traveling around town and getting to work and I've got approximately 68,000 on my car after nearly 8 years of use. It took me a while to get used to the anti lock brakes which immediately become effective if you happen to hit an icy patch in winter weather or if you hydroplane on a wet road surface. I never had a car with anti lock brakes prior to owning this car and it felt strange the first time the anti lock system took effect; as though the car began to drive itself! All you need to remember is to take your foot off the brake pedal and let the car's brakes to do the work in such situations! 

I am a physically challenged person who requires hand controls to operate my car and the Buick LeSabre has operated just fine for me under such conditions. I also have a compartment for my wheelchair attached to the roof of my LeSabre and have experienced no trouble with that either. 

The only misgiving I have about the 1994 Buick LeSabre is the paint job on the exterior of the car. About a year ago, the paint on the hood of the car began peeling, and not just a little. The paint was coming off in large sheets. I took the car to my local Buick dealer where the car was purchased and they said there was a chance that the paint job may have been affected by contaminated paint in some way for that year and model. Yet, repainting the car is not included in the extended warranty, which I purchased with the car. It would cost me hundreds of dollars to have the car completely repainted, even though the problem with the paint job is through no fault of my own. This is the second such problem with a paint job which my family has experienced with a Buick. My parents owned a 1985 Buick Century which had an exterior paint job which began fading. At first, it just looked as though it was perhaps fading through age and sun exposure, but after a few years, the car began to look two toned. My parents were also told that the paint job on that year and model of car might have been contaminated in the factory. The lousy paint job makes the car look horrible and dramatically decreases its resale value. 

If you are looking for a car that is a good, safe automobile which essentially gets you where you need to go, then the Buick LeSabre is a great car. But, if you are someone who is very fussy about how a car looks as well as how it operates, then you may want to steer clear of this car and look elsewhere.
