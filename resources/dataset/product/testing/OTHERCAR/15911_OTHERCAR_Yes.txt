            I love my Mercury Sable. My first car ever was an '89 Mercury Sable LS, and I've driven sables ever since. The Sable is roomy and comfortable, bringing all the safety qualities and dependability of the Ford Taurus with a bit more luxury. I also like the new updated design over the old &quot;bubble&quot; design that Ford/Mercury produced for the Taurus/Sable. While I consider this an excellent car, it does have a few flaws. The braking is not the best, and while the car does stop somewhat quickly, it has a tendency to slide, and to make it worse the tires do not have the best grip on the road. Also, while the new design is an improvement, it looks too much like a Toyota Camry or any Honda import car; it's lost that dramatic &quot;lightbar&quot; across the front and the taillights in the rear that stretch from side-to-side. Despite this, the adjustable pedals are an incredible advancement, and I hope to see that in every Mercury car and even every other car in the following years. Being able to adjust the pedals means everyone can reach the break pedal comfortably. The Sable is defined as a family car, but in truth I would suggest anyone can feel comfortable in it, from a teenager to a couple to a family.<br><br>
