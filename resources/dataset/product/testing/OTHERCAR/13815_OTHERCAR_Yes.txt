            The S430 combines optimum performance with incomparable performance. One sit in the new Benz and you will never want to sit in another sedan again. The front passenger and driver interior room is incredible. There is enough room in this car to live in. The car has 105 cubic feet of cabin room and you could live in the seats they are so comfortable. The engine design of the Benz is also amazing. The S430 produces 275 horsepower and 295 lb of torque and going 0-60 in 6.9 seconds. 

This car is recommended for any family that wants a sedan that will get their family from one place to another as safely as possible. The ride is also amazingly quiet. As you enter the car and turn on the ignition you can not even hear the engine start. The Benz also has many little features that make it a unique and fun car. The key hole for the ignition is on the side of the dash versus next to the steering wheel and the key comes with a laser for remote entry that works from amazing distances. Inside the car comes with a GPS system and LCD display. With these options the car practically drives for you while you relax. Everything in the car can be controlled from the fingertips of the driver. All the controls are located on the steering wheel allowing the driver to change settings without taking their eyes off the road. The exterior also is very unique. The S430 comes with turning signals on the sideview mirrors which adds to the sleek design of the Benz. At around 70k the S430 makes your money very well spent.

There are no major drawbacks to the S430 or mechanical problems. The price might be a little too steep for those who want a luxury car but there is a price to pay for supreme luxury. I would not recommend this car for those that want a family car but would have to go out of their way to fit this car in their budget.<br><br>
