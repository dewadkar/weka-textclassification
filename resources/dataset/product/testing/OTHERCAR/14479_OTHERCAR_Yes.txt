            I decided to buy a convertible after greatly enjoying a convertible Chrysler Sebring rental car.  I normally hated driving, but something about the wind blowing around you makes driving more tolerable; even fun.  After careful consideration of my finances, it became clear that there was only one possible choice for an affordable four-seater convertible: The Chrysler LeBaron.

I shopped around for several months -- bought many an AutoTrader magazine.  I finally purchased a 1995 Chrysler LeBaron GTC convertible approximately four months ago.  It had 58,000 miles at the time of purchase.  The exterior had several minor flaws (e.g., scratches, pits) and one substantial flaw in the nose which was easily fixed by a body shop for around $125.  The top was in good shape except that the trim stitching had come away from the corners around the glass rear window.  I hand-sewed the corners back in about 2 hours of careful work.  The cloth interior was exceptional; as flawless as one can expect in a five-year-old used car.  The owner had kept records of all services.  I bought the car for $6,500.00.

I felt like the luckiest man in the world.

In general, the LeBaron is in a class by itself.  It is the only four-seater convertible (as far as my research revealed) with the power of a V6, so many available comfort options, a power top, dual air bags, and a glass rear window with a defroster, that would qualify as an affordable middle-class car.  This combination of characteristics is most often found in high-dollar BMWs and Mercedes.

Make no mistake though, you're not getting a BMW or a Mercedes when you buy a LeBaron.  The car is full of rattles and squeaks.  Road noise is high.  My top has leaked a small bit.  And, the entire car gives off a &quot;cheapie&quot; vibe, e.g., poor paint, loose or weak panels, over use of cheap plastic moldings and vinyl to form the rear seat and top storage compartment.

The key to loving the LeBaron is the phrase &quot;For the Money.&quot;  It will not go down in the annals of automobile history as a noteworthy car.  But, it is an excellent car for the money.  Let me say it again, the LeBaron is a truly excellent car FOR THE MONEY.

If you drive a LeBaron and feel the car is just trying to pull off high-dollar car characteristics in a low-dollar way, you're right.  That's exactly what you should expect.  Add to that the fact that the car is used, and you can expect even less.  Most of the LeBaron naysayers I have seen on the net simply have too high expectations.  They buy one for a few thousand dollars and have the audacity to complain that &quot;the top leaks&quot; or &quot;the driver's window came off the track.&quot;  When I read such things, I want to scream, &quot;YOU GOT A V6 CONVERTIBLE FOR ALMOST NOTHING, SO SHUT UP!&quot;

As for road performance, I am very satisfied.  The 3.0 V6 is surprisingly strong and fairly responsive, my only complaint being a slight delay in initial acceleration.  The engine has proven excellent for tooling around town or rushing up an interstate on-ramp.  I have done a lot of both since buying this car.  The body has a good deal of flex under hard cornering, but that is found in all convertibles, and the amount of flex in the LeBaron is no worse than most low-dollar convertibles.  My transmission shifts crisply, but see my tranny warning below.

As to the interior, the front sets are comfortable with enough leg room for my 5'11&quot; frame.  The climate controls are simple and well-placed, although I prefer dials over the slide and push button combination in the LeBaron.  The rear seats are spoiled by the protrusion of plastic pieces that house the convertible top frame when it's retracted.  As a result, there is not much room in the back, and what room is left is not well designed.  The plastic pieces force the adult rider to move uncomfortably toward the middle of the seat.  Kids should be fine, though.  Again, small complaints.

  THUS FAR, I have had no major mechanical problems, nor any sign of them.  A broken wire prevented my cruise control from working the first month, but it was soon corrected.  The right-rear window creeps up slowly, but I'll wait until it stops altogether before I get it fixed.  My research showed several complaints of transmission failure in late model LeBarons, although I have no complaints.  I changed my tranny fluid immediately on purchase as a precaution.  Other common complaints I have heard related to leaky tops and failed electric windows.  I consider these minor problems.

My only major complaint is the total lack of a cup holder.  It ain't there.  Now, you could use the ash tray as a cup holder if you wanted to, but your drink may block the radio controls, and only the most narrow of cups would fit.  Additionally, finding an aftermarket cup holder that fits is a chore.  I finally located a type that works perfectly by locking a flexible piece of rubber inside the slot the window retracts into.  I couldn't get any other type of holder to work.

In sum, if you want an inexpensive convertible, the LeBaron is a fine choice.  I saw it as my only choice given my lust for power and options and my empty wallet.  But, buy it because you need BOTH qualities, i.e., convertible and cheap.  If you just want a good convertible, there are much better choices (I hear the new Toyota Solara is nice).  If you just want a cheap car, there are better, more reliable, and more practical choices.  But, the Lebaron is an excellent combination of fun and value.  I highly recommend it.

Good luck to you.<br><br>
