            My wife and I had been looking for a reliable family style car. After looking around we discovered the Mercury mystique. We took this car for a test drive and decided that it was a perfect car for us. Our car is Maroon and has cloth seats. 

The seat fits our 2 car seats in the back comfortably and there is even a bit of room for my wife to ride between the car seats if we are having a long car ride where the children require her extra attention. 

The Mercury Mystique gets great gas milege when it is tuned up at about 25 mpg in city driving and 30 mpg in highway driving. With the gas prices so ridiculously high right now it was very important to have a vehicle that gets higher gas milege. 

Trunk space was another thing we were concerned with when searching for a vehicle. We had to have a car that has a reasonable sized trunk for hauling our camping gear and bags that we have for our weekend trips away from home. 

We got this car in may and so far other than the initial tune-up, change of tires and oil changes we have not had to have any repairs done on this vehicle.

While we have not had this vehicle for long I believe it will last us many more years and it has proven to be a very dependable and reliable car.
