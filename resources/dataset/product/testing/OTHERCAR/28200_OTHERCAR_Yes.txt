            After owning a LOT of GM cars, and trucks, the styling of the Durango lured me into a Dodge Dealership.  I have owned  8 Oldsmobiles, 1 Chevy, and one Pontiac.  I was STRICTLY a GM man. I liked the Bravada a lot, LOVED the Suburban, but the Durango is the KING.  It is roomier than any of the small SUVs, and not as ungainly to drive as the larger SUVs.  I had tried the Suburban, and it was a pretty good vehicle for the couple of years I owned it, but I really did not need all that room.  I run with a local Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad, so I needed a vehicle that handled pretty well.  The D (Durango) handles better than most cars.  It reminds me of my 1989 international edition of the Cutlass Supreme.  The international version is the one that handles better, and is sportier than the regular models.  This thing really grips in the turns, and does not feel like you are going to tip over like other trucks do.  You can throw it into a turn with confidence.  I drove 1999 Explorers, Tahoes, Jimmys, Bravadas, and even the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  None had the smooth, but yet &quot;in control&quot; feel of the D.  The Explorer drove like a boat, the bravada drove more like an economy car, the Tahoe was too big, and drove like it, the Jeep was perhaps second best, but it still was a far cry from the D.  I ended up going with the fully loaded D, with every option, except engine block heater.  I have put over 21,000 miles on it in the 8 months I have owned it.  I have had ZERO problems.  The D has more power than any of the others i drove, and the looks are second to none. It is pretty good in the snow, and I even had it on ice once.  I can't say that any vehicle is good on ice, but the D was about as good as can be expected.  It seems to have a good mix of power, traction, balance and weight for off road, and snowy conditions. The only drawback is the gas mileage.  I can get 20 MPG highway at best, but when you get the most powerful, you expect to buy more gas.  If you can afford a real SUV, then mileage is not going to be a concern. The seats are VERY comfortable, i have made 2 VERY long road trips, and have not been uncomfortable at all. I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a decent sized SUV.   By the way... extended warranties?  DON'T buy one...  they don't sell them to LOSE money, they expect your repairs to total less than the cost of the warranty.    Just my opinion...  In all the years of buying new cars, I have only bought one warranty, and did not recover the cost of it.  I decided never again, and have NEVER had to pay more for repairs than the warranty would have cost.   So, how do I REALLY feel about the D?  I am looking into getting one for the wife, does THAT tell you?  heh heh heh
