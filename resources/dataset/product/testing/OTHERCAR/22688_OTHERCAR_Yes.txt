            I will be brief , I bought the 2000 Grand AM for its aggressive styling. The car simply looks beautiful. The Grand AM has excellent performance from it's V6, excellent looks (inside and out), excellent handling, excellent gas mileage for a car of it's size and excellent value at under 20 grand. Driving a Grand Am is true Pontiac excitement. It has no trouble merging and keeping up with or passing traffic on the highway. On the road, it's smooth ride and superb handling almost leave one disappointed when they arrive at their destination. Grand AM shows that Americans have what it takes to make superb quality cars. It is for anyone who wants a fun car and a fun price.
