            The Chrysler LHS is a beautiful, luxurious, comfortable car.  I have not found any other vehicle that includes so much luxury as a standard part of the vehicle.  The value received for the price paid is very reasonable.  For these reasons I bought a used 1995 LHS from a Dodge/Chrysler dealer when the vehicle was only a year old. 

The 1995 LHS turned out to be an incredible financial burden.  It also was so unreliable I refused to drive it because I didn't want to be stranded! Chrysler has been generally unresponsive despite extensive problems being common with the 19995 LHS, according to the Chrysler mechanic. 

A few of the idiosyncrasies found in the car included:

       - Periodically most of the oil disappeared.  No leaks could be found.
       - Without warning the vehicle temperature would quickly shoot to maximum and the vehicle overheated. The water had all disappeared.  Again, no leaks were ever found.
      - The hood support released on its own, crashing down onto the back of my husband's head!
       - Parts of the electrical system from time to time failed without warning, then restarted once the vehicle was turned off and back on.  The failures appeared randomly first in one electrical component then another.  This was clearly a problem in the computer chip. 
       - The 7-year bumper-to-bumper warranty is nearly useless.  We had to pay over half of the repair costs.  The reason we had to pay so much?  Chrysler refused to replace the computer chip unless the Chrysler mechanic observed the problem.  However, the vehicle never had an electrical problem while in Chrysler repair center, of course, because the car could not be driven when an electrical component failed.  There was no way to get it into the mechanic without having to first turn off the motor.  The electrical problem would reset and could not be duplicated.

Before buying a 1995 Chrysler LHS have an independent, thorough review by a reliable mechanic.  Don't rely on what the dealer tells you.  The dealer who sold us our car also told us it was perfect, and it was - a perfect nightmare! 

A reliable LHS would be a dream for anyone wanting a comfortable, classy vehicle.
