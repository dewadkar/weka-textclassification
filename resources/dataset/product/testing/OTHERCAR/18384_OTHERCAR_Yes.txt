            When I was shopping for a new vehicle, although I had sworn off Fords, the design &amp; features of this van sold me, I opted to lease for 3 yrs. so when the warranty was up, I wouldn't have to worry about it.

 Well, when the lease was up, I had not had many problems other than my door locks, to turn it in too the lease I would have had to buy all new tires &amp; still have to pay a large fee to turn the vehicle in to the leasing dept. So we opted to buy the van out from the lease instead of going into another lease, and pay for new tires for someone elses new tires. 

This past summer I put some major repairs into the van, but it was paid off soon so I just figured it as maintenance.

 A couple weeks ago, my van wouldn't start. It has 66K miles, and has been maintained to all mft suggestions. I have it in the shop now &amp; am told that minimum 2 heads need to be replaced, a timing belt and possibly the entire engine, all of this was caused by either overheating (never happened), severe oil change neglect (didn't happen) or a faulty oil pump. So now, I have a van that is not paid off, up to $6-$7k in repairs, and the dealer says if I do not have all of my oil change rcpts too bad....who keeps all their oil change rcpts.?<br><br>
