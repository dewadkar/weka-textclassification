            Here's a perspective from a non-professional user. You know, the person who only dusts off the camera for parties and vacations.
 
At the time I bought this camera, back in 2000, it was touted as one of the best 2.1 Megapixel options available. It's the first digital camera I ever owned, so I don't really have a lot to compare it to. However, I've used some friends' cameras on occasion, and friends have used this camera, and based on that, I'd have to say this is a pretty complicated and cumbersome camera.

There are so many cool options! You can shoot little movies, take photos with a bunch of different effects (sepia tone, anyone?) and calibrate the settings a bazillion different ways. However, I haven't used a lot of these options because I either can't figure them out, or can't be bothered with them, or simply don't need them.

These are my biggest gripes:

- The default setting, every time you turn on the camera, is "high quality," and there's either no way to change that, or I am too dense to figure out how. This means so few pictures per card, and such big prints. That, or doing what I usually do, which is to change the quality setting to "standard" each time I turn the camera on. Which is not a one-click action -- calls for a lot of menu selecting and button-pushing.

- No USB port. This means you have to buy a separate card reader.

- Tendency to overexpose in full sun shots, no matter how much you fiddle with the settings. Also, tendency to overexpose flash shots. I almost never use the flash (but again, it defaults when the light is below a certain intensity, so if you want to turn it off, that's another series of buttons to push every time you turn it on!)

- Clumsy shape that doesn't tuck neatly into a bag while traveling. That said, the zoom lens is a great feature.

- No lens cap built in -- and the one that you can add on always falls off. Much has been said about this particular design flaw on the C2020!

I find that this camera does take really amazing landscape and still life shots. It also takes really cool long exposure shots in dimmer light without flash, if you can get it (and your subjects) to sit still that long!

All in all, I've enjoyed this camera, but I'm thinking about getting one that's flatter, smaller and simpler to use.
