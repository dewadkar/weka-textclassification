            This review is for the 1999 Acura CL w/3.0 liter 24-Valve V-6.

Let me start off by saying this automobile is fast!  I mean it'll go fast, but it also gets there quickly.  Throttle response is immediate.  There's more than enough power here for a coupe of this size.

Handling is excellent, although it could be improved with wider tires.  Unfortunately Honda chose to build their rocket-ships with tires that offered low ride noise at the expense of cornering ability.

Build quality is unparalled.  Acura is a high quality Honda, and I'm sure you're all aware of Honda's reputation.  We have over 22,000 miles on ours and not a single repair to date.

The only mark I can find against this "Super-Coupe", is the lack of headroom.  The raked roof design is in sharp contrast to todays bubbled design which grants additional headroom to taller drivers.  At 6'4", my head just touches the sunroof beam.  This would be extremely painful if I hit a bump in the road at any speed.  Therefore I have to lean the seat back a little further which means my neck is left unsupported.  This is alright for city driving, but would become very uncomfortable on long trips.

I personaly think the CL with rear spoiler is the more beautiful modern sports car I've ever seen.  As I recently admitted to my wife, "I haven't seen a rear end that beautiful since Katerina Witt!"

We get about 27-30 miles per on the highway, 22-24 in spirited city driving.  I replaced my stock headlamps with Xenon filled (9006) bulbs and the difference at night is remarkable.

My wife and I both love this car and have no intentions of ever getting rid of it, despite the lack of headroom.
