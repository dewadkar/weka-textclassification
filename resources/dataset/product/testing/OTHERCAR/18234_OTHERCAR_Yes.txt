             I am not the typical Volvo Owner.  I am a Bubba type in Texas.  My teenage daughter will soon get her drivers license and after rejecting her pleas for a 66 Volkswagen Beetle, or a 70 Karrman Ghia, or a 55 Nash Metropolitan,
 I made the decision to endow her with my most excellent 1996 Ford Ranger extended cab V-6 , 5 speed pickup truck.
 ( I told you a was a Bubba Type ! )
  That left me with a need for a replacement vehicle.
 I had been surfing E-bay, which is a great place to view 
 and familiarize oneself with different makes and models and prices.
  My attention fell to Volvos and I soon became intrigued with the styling. I like that boxy look as I am getting tired of the Jelly beaned shaped Taurus -clones. ( Arent you ?)
  I LOVE that Grill with the diagonal emblem. The car drips with a certain understated elegance that I find MOST appealing.  I also noticed that even the models with HIGH milage seemed to be holding up very well and commanding respectable prices.
 New Volvos are out of my range, so I went to the local dealership to look at a good used one.
  We selected a very nice 94 850 model.  It was that exquisite dark blue color that is perfect for this make and model. It has a tan leather interior, and a power roof.
 Premium sound , which is truly premium.
  My wife and I took it for a test drive. My wife was not interested in a Volvo. She adores her 1998 Mustang and was merely along to drive our other vehicle back home.
  I loved the car from the start. The power was excellent.
   The ride was very comfortable and very solid.  I knew that upon my return to the dealer ship I would tell the sales guy to write it up.
  Iris wanted to take the wheel, so we pulled over and switched drivers.  She didnt say much , but I looked over and she had that grin on her face and I said " You like it don't you ?"   She said she did and we wordlessly agreed that she, not I, would be the primary driver of this Volvo.
  That is OK with me.  I don't want her getting hurt in that Mustang while I have a perfectly good Volvo sitting in the garage. I guess I really knew all along that Iris' 
 relunctance to part with her beloved Mustang and her disinterest in Volvos would evaporate when she rode in one.
 So I climbed in the now orphaned Mustang with Iris trailing happily behind me in her  ( not Mine ) Volvo.

  We went to a party that night and returned home to find that our daugter waited up to see the car. We went for a ride in it and Charlotte went into ORBIT over the car !
  She following me all over the house begging me to give it to HER.  " Daddy ! Daddy ! You have to tell Mom shes being selfish !  She really became over wrought over it.  I thought it was kind of cute, in a way.
  We are a family of four.  A Mustang is'nt very useful for a household like this. Neither is a Ranger  actually,
 with those little jump seats in back.
  So I decided to return to the dealership the following saturday and trade in the Mustang for a SECOND Volvo 850,
 this one a 1995 red model.  It is a less , but still well equipped model than the 94.  It has no power roof or leather. But it has a nice sound system with a 6 cd Alpine changer in the trunk. It also had all maintenence records and a glove box of receipts that indicated all work was done at the dealership , even down to a Volvo battery , and I got a great price for my trade in.  
  ( They were getting a 1998 Mustang in primo condition and I made it clear that if I were going to accept a 3 year older car it too would have to be in primo condition.)
 I had them fix several items. Some discovered during the test drive , and some discovered over the course of the next several days.
  The one previous owner was a affluent female , with a evidently doting husband but she  seemed to have had a tendancy not to miss , or slow down for bumps .  She beat the bushings and the motor mounts right out of this car, so we had all those replaced and the ride is just marvelous.
 I had it sent to the tire shop and yanked the questionable Pirelli's and replaced them with a new set of Michelins and 
 I took the car home and presented it to my totally delighted daughter. Now all she needs is a drivers license !

  One more thing. I don't know where the car magazine people get the idea that this model doesnt corner well.  I have a sharp turn near my home and it enter the turn without slowing down and gas it at the apex of the curve and zip right around it with no brakes applied. 
  This is a fine car and wish I could have swung a later model(s) , but as I said , I am a Bubba -type . 
  For the price of a new Mustang  I have TWO Volvos in excellent mechanical and cosmetic condition sitting in my garage. And as one is a deep blue, and the other a bright red, they look absolutly beautiful sitting together in said
 garage.
  

  I highly recommend Volvo, even if you have a limited budget, You will do better investing in a well maintained pre-owned Volvo
 rather than getting a new ecomony car in my opinion.
