            After reading various epinions about this car, I decided to go with an Integra.  It's been 2 months since I purchased the vehicle and I don't have any regrets, but I do have some minor annoyances.  First, I'll go through the pluses.  One of the main things I was looking at was performance and I am not disappointed here at all.  For a V4 engine, it certainly has enough pep to it.  The braking is also exceptional, as expected for a small car.  The gas mileage is also great; some may complain about the 10~gal fuselage, but I get about 280-330 miles per tank.  The handling is great, I finally got to test the limits of this car when going up Market St. near Twin Peaks in San Francisco.  Not only is the road winding, but it's was also on a steep incline.  It really hugs the curves well and maintaining good balance and speed.  Finally, all the extras, which are standard, really make this deal sweet.
On the downside, the interior is small.  I'm 5'11&quot; and trim, but moving around in the car is rather hard.  I really can't imagine a bigger person fitting in this car.  The suspension is terrible, especially on bumpy roads.  Driving this into potholes is not good for the car.  The entire chassis shakes, giving off an uneven ride.  I can't fathom why anyone would want to lower this vehicle?!?  The interior is cheap, eventho I got the GS trimline; I can see that the inner door handle is gonna fall apart.  It's also not as quite as I would have expected.  The Hondas are much better at this for some reason.<br><br>
