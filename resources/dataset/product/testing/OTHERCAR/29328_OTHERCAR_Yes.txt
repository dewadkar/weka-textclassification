            Before purchasing my 1999 Chevy Tracker, I owned a 1993 Ford Mustang with a 4-cylinder engine that I drove on a hour-and-a-half commute each day. I wanted a vehicle that was reliable, 4-wheel-drive, got good mileage and was comfortable on long trips. The Tracker is all that and more!

The seats are very comfortable easy to adjust and the ride is just as smooth as any car I have ridden in. It does have tendency to shake a bit when slowing down from a high rate of speed (I commute on a 4-lane highway), but it has no problem keeping up with other vehicles on the road. It does lack, however, in start off power, especially on an incline.

I have used the 4-wheel-drive on a couple of occasions in snow and ice and it does very well. Four Lo seems have quite a bit road hugging power over Four High, but it still handles adverse conditions well in either mode. in any case, 4 or 2 wheel drive, handling is like a small car, not at all like a truck.

I have noticed on windy days, when driving on the freeway, that there tends to be quite a bit on noise coming from the convertible top, but I usually just turn the radio up and pay it no mind.

The size is very nice for navigating crowded parking lots and there is absolutely no problem getting in and out of parking spaces. the turning radius is extremely tight, so you can almost turn a complete circle in the middle of a parking lot row!

Overall, the Tracker is a great "tooling around town" vehicle for our small, three person family. We can't wait to try it out in warmer weather with the top down, or on the Blue Ridge Parkway!
