            This is the best digital camera for those who enjoy the outdoors.  It can get rained on, dropped, bumped and it continues to work perfectly.  Weatherproof design keeps moisture out in almost any environment. Use in rain or mist, dusty and dirty conditions, on the beach, near the pool or while boating.  This camera has large controls for better handlingï¿½even when wearing gloves, so you can use it in cold weather.  After reading the owners manual once I was able to utilize all of the cameras features, of which there are numerous.  Two-megapixel resolution provides you with excellent picture quality.  Choose from the 2X optical and 3X digital zoom or the wide-angle lens to take pictures in a variety of spaces. All in all, a practical package that is as easy to use as a point and shoot.
