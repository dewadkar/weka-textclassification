               I recently got into a car accident which a 16 year high school girl hit me. Was looking for a used car with low mileage, nice looks, having good gas mileage, & not too old. I came across a Daewoo Lanos from 2000 with only 48,000 miles on it. I was aware of GM buying out Daewoo & of hearing how people having trouble finding parts for their car or anyone to work on them. I did some research online for Daewoo Lanos car parts & was able to find 5 websites selling anything from shocks, brakes, transmission parts, engine parts, brakes, & sensors. So, finding parts for the Daewoo Lanos just takes some looking into is all. Plus, after learning GM bought out Daewoo they will now honor the warranty from what I am understanding. Also, Chevy is coming out in 2004 with the Chevy Aveo which is being built in the Daewoo autoplants. It is the same engine & body style, so the parts should be interchangeable once more Chevy Aveo's start selling on the market.
    After having the 2000 Daewoo Lanos now for a month I am very happy with it. It is peppy for a small car of it's size. Also, has a great turning radius & is very responsive for the small 4 cylinder 105 horsepower engine. The engine compartment allows you enough room to do most minor car repairs & maintenance yourself such as I do. The seats are nice & comfortable & the car drives nice & smooth. The transmission is a bit loud when changing gears, but not too noticeable. Trunk space is a lot for such a small car for it's size. Kind of fools you until you look in & see how much actual space you have. Fuel economy also is very impressive for this car. I am getting on average 28 in the city & about 34 on the highway with my automatic transmission. Back seats are kind of small for big people, but good if your just transporting groceries or other supplies.
    Over all after having the car for a month I am very impressed & now that the Chevy Aveo is coming out finding parts for the car should be a bit more easier. I would highly recommend this car as a used car for anyone looking not to spend a lot on a used car.
