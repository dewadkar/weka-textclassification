            I purchased a 2001 Forester in June and love it.  I traded in a 4 wheel drive Toyota Tacoma.  I completed many hours of research which included talking with many Subaru owners as well as reading up on all professional reviews, safety articles and racing articles on the Impreza.  The Forester is built on the Impreza which wins off-road races all over the world. Subaru has been making all-wheel drive cars longer than any other manufacturer.  There is a strong following for Subaru engines in the small aircraft industry because of their reliability. The car is quiet on the highway, handles much better than any other sport utility (almost as good as a sports car), and does not require a roll-over warning from the manufacturer.  I have a 5 speed which shifts very smoothly and I am getting 26 in the city and almost 30 on the highway. The engine has plenty of power too.  The seats are firm but supportive.  There is enough back seat room and good storage behind the rear seats as well. We looked at the Honda, but there was not enough horsepower and the highway ride noisy.  The suspension on the Forester is significantly heavier duty than the honda as well  We are very impressed with our Forester. I have met several other Subaru owners with over 150,000 miles and their cars are still running great. I have not had any problems at all so far.  

I plan on towing a utility trailer for hauling building materials, it should handle it without any problems.   <br><br>
