            I had the privilege of owning one of the first 1984 Jeep Cherokees, and loved nearly every minute I spent in it in the ensuing eight years.  I watched Jeep change hands several times during the period when they had practically the only viable SUV. When Jeep announced the end of the Cherokee this summer, I assumed I'd never be happy with another SUV, but decided to try the new crop.  Blazer - too GMC and spendy with old features and style; Ford Escape - too small, too limited; Xterra - too much macho baloney; Jeep Grand Cherokee - too much money. Finally, I gave in and took a Jeep Liberty for a drive, and bought it on the spot.

The Liberty has as much, if not more, room in the front and rear seats as the old Cherokee, MUCH more power than the 4-cylinder Cherokee, and a much better ride. The rear area is smaller, but doesn't share its volume with the spare. Headroom is excellent - I can wear my BIG Stetson in the vehicle. Underneath, it's still a Jeep, not a body bolted to a standard common truck frame, or even a car frame.

I bought a Liberty with all the bells and whistles (for once).  The electrically adjusted seats are a real luxury to me.  Leather gives it a real sense of luxury, along with the 1 and 6 CD changer, electric windows, heated mirrors, etc. The 3.7L V-6 engine has great energy, but its fuel burn is the one weak spot.  So far, I average 18 MPG in mixed city and country driving. That isn't even that bad, considering that in 100,000 miles, at $1.50 gallon for regular, a vehicle getting 22 MPG would cost about $1500 less in fuel over the planned 7 years to get there, and that vehicle still wouldn't be a Jeep. (Heck, my old 4-cylinder Cherokee got 19-20 MPG, and couldn't get out of its own way on freeway hills.)

The swing-up rear window is a big improvement over the full hatch, or even the swing-away full door on other vehicles. The tire is attached to the lower swing-out door, so you don't have to deal with it.

Overall, I'm very happy with my choice.  After you check out the Kia Sportage, the Ford Escape, and whatever else is out there, you'll be happy too.
