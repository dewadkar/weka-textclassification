            I just got my A1 about 8 days ago, and have shot about 200 pics with it so far.  I researched digital cameras in the $400 to $900 range and came up with the Minolta A1.

During my long search into the wee hours of the morning, I concentrated mostly on: quality, optical zoom, features, brand, and price.  Within this criteria, I was mostly concerned with the power of the optical zoom, the range of shutter speeds and aperture settings, as well as, how in-depth was the manual settings.

When the family is over for a gathering, I enjoy fast acting auto-features and focusing, but when I feel the urge to be creative, I really want a camera that I can control right down to the smallest sub-setting.  I know there are an assortment of &#147pro&#148 digital SLRs to be had, but I&#146m not much of a pro and the $1500 to $6000 price tag kinda scared me.  So off to the mid $600 range I went.

The A1 has just about everything I could ask for:

- 7x optical zoom,
- Shutter speeds from below 15sec to above 1/10,000sec,
- Wide range of F-stops,
- Good control over white balance,
- In-depth user interface controls,
- Bright LCD panel,
- Great macro modes,
- Good AE control,
- Great feedback info on viewfinder and LCD screen,
- And plenty of extras to play with.

On the flip side however, there are a few things that have just about caused me to return the camera back to the store:

- Auto-focus hunts in low light, macro mode, while shooting reflective subjects, and when high contrast is not possible.  I found that if I consistently use the flash or turn on some bright lights while shooting indoors, the hunting problem diminishes, but I find it difficult to drag around a bright lamp, and using the flash all the time doesn&#146t lend itself to pretty pictures.

- Auto-white balance is almost non-functional in indoor lighting.  Yes, manual is there, but when moving quickly from tungsten to florescent to flash, having to manually adjust WB each shot, can be a bummer.

- Zero water resistance.  The speaker on the side of the camera, reveals the internal printed circuit cards.  So, don&#146t even slightly splatter this unit with water, or you&#146ll be sorry you did.

- And last but not least (in by book anyway), is the total lack of protection for the LCD screen!!!  There isn&#146t a digital camera that I&#146ve seen yet that exposes their LCD screen like the A1 does.  Hang this beauty around your neck while wearing snaps or set this on your car seat next to a seat belt, and you could find yourself with a non-functional LCD screen as a result.  If you own a PC LCD screen and have ever slightly rubbed your finger across the screen, you will have seen some light distortions left by your finger while pressing on the screen.  Well, that means, in short, that if you apply any amount of increases pressure directly on to the LCD screen, you will most likely permanently damage the LCD panel.  I called Minolta, and they told me that there are no clip-on protectors available for this LCD display and warranty will not cover it, if you damage it.  So there you have it; build in obsolescence at its best.

Other then the bad stuff, it's a wonderful camera, full of rich features.  And if you are fussy enough to protect the LCD screen, and you don't mind using the flash or shooting in bright lighting conditions while indoors, then this is the camera for you.  As for me, I&#146ll probably ask for a replacement, just to see if the problems I'm experiencing are limited to this unit only.  I'll try to add to this review later, after I get a new A1 replacement unit.

I'm currently comparing the pros and cons of the A1 to the Canon Rebel Digital, and will add a brief comparison soon.
