            If you're looking for a fun, fast, yet reliable car definitely look into the 240 Sx. For those of you into performance and racing as well as those you just want a car that's comfortable to drive and won't leave you stranded, I highly recommend this car. 

I own a white 1990 hatchback 240 and I love it. It's a 5-speed manual transmission, 2.4L 4cyl engine.  I've has the car for 4 years and have had to do only minor repairs and regular maintenance. Not bad for an engine that now has over 217,000 miles!  

It shifts easily for a smooth ride has a great torque curve getting awesome power between 3000-4000 rpm - way below red line.  This car is also easily modified for even better racing performance. I am currently working on swapping my stock engine for Nissan's SR20DET, a lighter 2.0L engine that adds about 100hp and bolts right in.  The weight ratio is nearly 50:50 front:rear so has excellent handling and takes curves like few other cars I've driven.   

Well enough with the technobabble, this car is great for everyday driving as well. It's priced reasonably and will remain reliable for years to come. The interior is designed to be both comfortable and functional, although taller people may find the back seat a little inhibiting. The trunk has plenty of room to haul your stuff and the front seats are roomy.
