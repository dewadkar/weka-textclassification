                    The new 2001 BMW Z8 is a car that is not only fast, but also expensive, and is not for everyone.  The BMW Z8 can dart to 60 miles per hour in only 4.2 seconds, it can do the quarter mile in 12.6 seconds, and as you can tell is a very serious sports car.  It's price is in the $128,000 range, which many of us cannot afford.  But if your planning on getting one, you may have to wait until next year.  Only 400 of these handbuilt roadsters are headed for the U.S. shores this year.  
        There are many aspects of this car that are unique.  The engine is a 5.0 liter/400 horsepower DOHC(Double Overhead Cam)V-8.  This engine is also used in the super sedan, the M5.  The Z8 is basically made of aluminum.  The weight distribution is 50/50.  This is truly an amazing car, especially for the people that can afford it.  If you want a world class sports car, this is your car, but for everyone that can't afford it, you can always dream to own one.<br><br>
