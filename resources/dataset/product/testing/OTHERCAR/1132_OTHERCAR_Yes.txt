            Well almost everything I love anyway. 

I don't know where to begin so I'll start from the beginning.
I'm 18 years old and have been saving for a new car for a while now. About a year or two. I had always wanted a Neon for a choice of a first car for the simple reason that they are wonderful cars. 
You'll read that there have been gasket issues, and that there have been radiator issues, and there were but they seem to be taken care of now. 
The 2001 Neon I got is exactly like the 2000. It came with remote key-less entry 4 wheel ABS (which come in very handy if you live near squirrels like I do) A/C, Power windows, 5-year warranty, and other little creature comforts.
This car beats the daylights out of my old car, which was a '87 Nissan Sentra, which was braking, down on me left and right. 
I think the reasons most people seem to have problems with there cars are because they aren�t treating them with enough respect. A lot of people now days go out spend a lot of cash for a car and don't even keep it well maintained. 
And if you think an oil change and filter is all you need to do <b> Believe me it isn't </b> You need to get additives, tune-ups, SUPREME GASOLINE, and other things. It may be a pain in the butt but that's part of the responsibilities of getting a car. If you can't afford it, you can't afford a car. 
Anyway back to the car....
God it's fun to drive! I mean it, I haven�t had this much fun driving a car since I first got a car and soon realized that it was really just a pain in the butt to drive in that beast. :) 
My mom owns a BMW it has great handling; I honestly feel my handling is a heck of a lot better then hers. 
My sound system is definitely a lot better then hers (both are stock) I do have to admit though the Stereo is a bit awkward to get used to at first, due to the position it's in. 
There are 4 cup holders the 2 up front support mugs which is nice on those winter mornings and you need to set your mug of beer in there, I mean coffee. :) 
I wasn't too fond with the way the outside of the car looked when I bought it but it grew on me and now I really like it. When ever I get done washing it on my days off I nearly burst into tears at the thought of a bird relieving itself on it. 
I got the ES model for a steal, the sticker price said 16,000 but I said I can�t afford that and threatened to walk off the lot if they couldn�t even drop it to 15,000. It took all of two minutes for him to talk to his supposed manager and come back out saying �We got it down to 15,000.� They also have a 1000 rebate right now, which doesn�t seem to look like it�s going away soon. 
Take advantage of the fact that Dodge�s sales have gone down, bargain with them as much as you can with the price.
It�s amazing how much enjoyment you can get out of key-less entry. Sometimes I just play with the buttons, (I know, I�m a moron) but I love it.
I installed a CD player myself for dirt-cheap making the car a lot more fun sound wise. 
The car brakes like no other and the ABS is outstanding, I had to brake from hitting a dog running in front of my car and I know if I was in my old car I would have killed the thing. Instead it lives on to roll around in it�s own filth for another day.  I have already put on 8 thousand miles and it runs fine, as it should. I guess it�s to early to say that I have any car issues but my friend own a 98 neon that keeps braking down, not because it�s a piece of junk it�s cause he changes the oil about 2 times a year, never once got it tuned up professionally, never got his brakes replaced when he knew he needed to, so that ruined his rotors. 
Your car is as good as you maintain it. (Not always, but most of the time) 
And so I�m going to leave it as that and say good-bye to you all.
