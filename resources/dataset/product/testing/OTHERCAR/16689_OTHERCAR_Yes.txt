            I absolutely love this camera!  After first purchasing and returning a Toshiba PDR M60 digital camera (Ugh - check out my review on that one!) I decided on the Sony MVC-FD85 because it seemed more appropriate for our needs - durable, easy to use, fast uploads, etc. It has definitely made a believer out of me.

First of all, it's very easy to use - this is actually a work camera and my boss hates to learn to use new gadgets but he had no trouble catching on to this one.  We use it mostly to take pictures on location at construction sites so it was important that our camera be durable, large enough to operate with gloved hands, yet small enough to be convenient.  The camera comes with a neck strap and a lens cover which is really adds to it's convenience. 

You have the option of using the LCD screen or the viewfinder to view your shots. The only downfall I've found with this camera is that the LCD screen is prone to fingerprints because it doesn't have a cover and it's just in a place your fingers can't really help but touch.  But it's not hard to wipe them off with the soft cloth that comes with the care kit. Using the LCD screen obviously uses the battery a little more, but I hardly notice it. 

In fact, the battery life is absolutely amazing on this camera! The last camera we had ran off of AA batteries that lasted maybe 15 minutes if we were lucky.  The Sony MVC-FD85 holds it's charge for several hours! I have yet to use the backup battery we bought "just in case".  The handbook states that in continuous recording in still mode, the supplied battery can take approximately 750 images, in recording/movie mode, approximately 65 movies. The extra battery you can buy can take approximately 1600 images and approximately 140 movies! Simply amazing.

I admit that I haven't utilized all of the fine tuning options this camera has because there are so many of them and we haven't had a need for them yet.  Some of them include: recording the date and time on still images, picture effects such as solarize, B&W, Sepia, and Neg.Art, adjusting exposure and white balance just to name a few.  The movie option is a really fun addition to this camera.  You can record up to 15 seconds of audio and video. I also appreciate being able to select the wide range of image sizes (from 160x112 up to 1280x960. 

While this camera might be a little expensive and high tech for a beginner, it really is a great camera. Once you get to play around with it, you won't want to settle for less!
