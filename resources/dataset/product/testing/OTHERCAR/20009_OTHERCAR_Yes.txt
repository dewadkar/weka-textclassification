            At over $30,000, this car is not cheap.  Essentially, it is a quieted Camry, with a tuned engine and suspension.  However, the end product is a feel of luxury.

Backseat is cramped, especially for leg room.

Leather is soft and supple, the way it should be.

Wood trim is nice.

Acceleration is quick, engine sounds great.

Interior is QUIET.  However, doors aren't heavy, and are very light.  Design, not an overuse of sound deadening material is the reason for the silence.

Trunk space is ample.

Sound system is excellent.

Climate control system works well; cools and heats effeciently.

Overall, a very comfortable and luxurious car.  Quiet, smooth, elegant...It is perfect, no flaws whatsoever, except for the cramped backseat.  There is nothing wrong with this car, except for maybe the price.  You get what you pay for.  I think that the Camry is such a great value, and it makes this Lexus seem overpriced.  For those considering this car, i would recommend they take a look at the Avalon, if they wish to save some money and get a larger, slightly less refined car.
