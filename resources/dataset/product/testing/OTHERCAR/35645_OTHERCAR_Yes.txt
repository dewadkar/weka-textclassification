            The DX3215 was my first digital camera purchase. Not being an avid picture taker I decided to purchase an entry level camera. It did not come with the dock as many now do but it was an easy set up and was ready to go within minutes.  It came with the standard Kodak battery which must be replaced with NiMHi Rechargeable batteries. (Alkaline do not work at all, well, they may turn the camera on, but good luck trying to get a picture out of them or view the preview screen).  The 8mb onboard memory was sufficient enough for the first 4 months but I soon upgraded to to a 32mb external card with allows for about 125 high quality pictures. This has been a solid camera, I was a bit confused about its battery usage during the beginning as it seemed to use batteries quickly. However as time went on I found that I could take 120 pictures before having to recharge.  I am currently using Energizer rechargeable NiMHi batteries and they have been working great in the camera.  The quality of pictures are great and the option to select different types of flash or eliminate it entirely has proved very useful for my amateur photo shooting experience.

I had one warranty experience within the first 6 months of purchasing this camera. However it was only over the confusion that Alkaline batteries do not operate well in the camera. I sent the camera back and not only did they check it out, they sent me a new Kodak battery and cleaned it up for me. It wasn't gone for more than just a few weeks. My next camera may be a Kodak but it will be much smaller with a few more bells and whistles.
