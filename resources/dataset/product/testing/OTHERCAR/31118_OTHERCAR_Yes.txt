            My family bought our 1994 Jeep Sport in 1996.  Overall it was a great buy.  The jeep looks nice and is a great travel vehicle.  The spare tire does take up a good amount of space in the back, but there is still lots of room for luggage.  We have taken about 10 trips in it to Calif since 1996 and have fit luggage for 2 adults a girl who is now 10 and an infant boy with his travel bed and many other needed accessories.  
I would recommend this car, however, for families no bigger then 4 members.  The back seat is not large and starts getting uncomfortable if there is even 1 medium size person in the back.  My daughter has a hard time when a friend is in the car and my son's car seat. The wheel wells take up part of the back seat space and makes it hard to get in and out of the car. The other downfall is it is not the best car for the front seat passenger on long trips.  I didn't realize it until our first trip, but the seat only lays down about 1/4 of the way.  It makes it hard to sleep or get comfortable.  Also, the seat of the front seats are shorter than the average car which makes for a sore bottom.
A big advantage has been that there has been nothing major happen to the car that my husband couldn't fix himself and it already has 138,000 miles on it.  So there are good and bad things to owning a jeep.<br><br>
