            I bought this car thinking like everyone else.  A cheap car with a great warranty so since it is so cheap its ok to break because i have this great warranty right.  Wrong!  I would have rather shot myself in the foot then buy this car if i knew i was going to have these problems.  I am also currently in a suit against KIA requesting my money back because the car is garbage.  I would rather plant some flowers in it then drive it.  Problems i have are as follows.  Every time it rains the water seeps through the door frame which i am sure is well rusted by now.  so every time that i roll my window up or down i have to rewash it or the whole thing is streaked.  my engine light and O/D light keep coming on and like everyone else when i take it in it "fixes itself" Recently i was driving on the parkway and stalled doing 65 what a nightmare that was trying to get over in time so other cars don't slam into me.  I almost got hit three times trying to get over.  My car shakes when the air is on so much i end up turning it off.  My gears don't transfer over and i don't even have a manuel it is automatic.  there is a rotten egg smell coming out of it where when you walk by its like your dad just ate beans.  the radio sucks.  the whole car sucks-except the steering wheel cover which i bought and was not made in korea but USA.   thank god because if they did make it it would probably fall off.  the paint is chipping already.  the car is a mess i can go on and on but i won't.  In my opinion the is the worst then the rabbit. and i never get to drive it since it is in the shop so much i decided to now hail a taxi to work since my great 100,000 mile warranty is taking car of business.  I think next time i will go with a car with a chorter warranty just to be on the safe side because with the time in the shop it will be expired because of the date not miles since i can't even get to drive it.my opinion.  ONLY BUY THE CAR THEY TESTED ON THE COMMERCIAL WHEN THEY DROVE ACROSS COUNTRY.  That is probably the only good kia out there.
