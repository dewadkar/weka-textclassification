            In the past 16 years, I've owned three Subarus, and they were good runners, the lot of them. The first was a <i>Brat</i>, then a 1985 <i>GL Wagon</i>, and finally, a 1997 <i>Legacy GT-B</i>. This is their story, and the story of the development of Subaru. 

<b>My First Love</b>

In 1984, I found a 1979 Subaru Brat sitting in my neighbors yard. It had four flat tires and a family of mice living in the air cleaner. After airing up the tires, installing a new battery and a forced relocation of the mice, it was sitting in my driveway. I slid in a new set of head gaskets and I was on the road. This car was no powerhouse. It's 1600cc engine with a whopping 67 horsepower could barely get out of it's own way. Where this little truck was in it's own element was off the road. Snow, mud, sand; it pushed on. It had just enough power to be alot of fun, as long as you kept it in first or second gear. 

It's transmission did not have a low range, and it really didn't have enough ground clearance, but it was a blast. After only one year of going surf-casting, the entire body started to rot out. It got to the point where the floors fell out, and the front fenders started flapping in the wind. But the little pick-up truck just kept on going. The only maintenance I did to it was to add oil. At 165,000 miles, the engine burned enough oil to consider it self-changing. I drove this little truck for almost three years. It met it's demise one sunny Sunday afternoon in a running paintball battle against an old Wagoneer. A collision with an abandoned International Harvester chest freezer did it in; the rotten little 'Ru was no match for the antique freezer (which I swear was made out of cast iron). 

<b>Subaru Number Two</b>

My second Subaru was a 1985 GL Wagon. This is the box Subaru that you see all over the place. This one showed up in my shop in 1990 with no oil pressure. The owner abandoned the little car, and went on with his life. Stuck with it, I decided to open up the motor and see what was wrong. The oil pump pickup had cracked. With a little bit of JB Weld (epoxy) and a new oil pan gasket, it was back on the road. This one has an 1,800 cc engine with 82 horsepower. It's 5-speed and dual range four-wheel drive tranny is a big improvement. This is also not a powerhouse, but it has enough to be driveable. I have not taken this one out four-wheeling, but in the snow and mud, it handles great. 

I think the interior is a little tight. It IS a huge improvement over the Brat. With AC and cruise control, it's not bad for long hauls over the highway. 

This one gets maintained as it is my parts runner, and customer loaner. If I had to put a price on repairs and maintenance over the last 10 years, I figure it would come in around a grand for CV joints, brakes, tune-up parts, timing belts and tires. It's got about 185,000 on it and still runs and looks great. 

<b>1997 Legacy GT-B Wagon</b>

This is not your typical rice-burner. It's outward appearance is that of a Legacy Wagon. A sharp eye will catch the factory 17-inch BBS rims, and Yokahama tires. Under the stock looking hood lies a 4-cylinder, 2.0 L, 4-cam, intercooled, sequential twin turbocharged beast. It puts out a whopping 275 ponies. This might not sound like much, but shoe-horned into a car weighing a little bit over 3,000 lbs. makes for a wild HP to weight ratio. With a 5-speed tranny and full time all wheel drive, this is an entirely different kind of fun. 

Under the 17-inch wheels lie a set of 16-inch rotors with dual piston calipers in the front, and 15-inch in the rear. Hooked up to a Nippon ABS setup, this spells out more than enough braking power with almost no fade. The steering is rack and pinion, and when driven hard, there's plenty of oversteer for a truly memorable driving experience. There's nothing like eating up some over-priced Euro cruiser on the highway in the family station wagon. 

This car has some quirks. The performance is flat from a stop until the turbo picks up. This starts at around 4,500 RPM, and pulls <i>very</i> hard until you hit about 7,500 RPM. From a stop, it will not smoke the tires. At the track last fall, I clocked it at 14.75 seconds on the quarter mile. Nothing great. Where this car is in it's groove is around 60 MPH. Drop two gears and hold on! 

The interior is like every other Subaru built around this time; very comfortable, laid out nicely, and with all the bells and whistles (power sunroof and windows, CD player, cruise control, and AC). A real far cry from the Brat. 

I haven't owned this long enough to repair anything yet. This model wasn't really imported much to the states (I found this one in British Columbia). I can't wait until the spring when I figure out how to to get a nitrous oxide kit under the hood. 

I've been driving and spinning wrenches on Subarus for almost 20 years, and I love them. I've also watched them grow from tiny little underpowered rot boxes to a real world class automobile. After the last 20 years, I can't wait to see what the next 20 will bring.     <br><br>
