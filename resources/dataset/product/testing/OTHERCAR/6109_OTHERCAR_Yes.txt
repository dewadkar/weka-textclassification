            To Whom ever reads this.
I purchased my 2000 Impala LS back on November 19th 1999. I finally decided on purchasing it when I drove some other cars (Intrepid, Taurus) and I came to the conclusion that the Impala was the best deal for the money. I went with a fully loaded Impala that had every option except &quot;OnStar&quot;. This is my review of the car to date.

Looks - It's either a love or Hate design. I hear both opinions from everyone. I choose this car because it does not look like everything else on the road. I drove a Ford Taurus for a few years, the bad part about that was that so did millions of other people. And the resale value of the Taurus was not well because of this fact. (1993 Got me 3,400 in Good condition).

Performance - The package I bought had the stiffer suspension and the 3.8L Series II engine. Accelerates and corners very well compared to Intrepid and Taurus. 0-60 is 7.6 Seconds, and Gas Mileage is not bad either. So far I'm getting about 25mph, for someone with the occasional &quot;Lead Foot&quot; thatï¿½s not bad.

Stereo - Um,, This sucks. Chevy thought to incorporate a lot of the computer controls into the stereo, and at the same time give you a stereo that has no bass to it. I would pull the stereo out if I could and replace it with an aftermarket stereo, but unfortunately nobody makes an aftermarket DIN size adapter to change out the deck with yet. I purchased a Factory Service manual just so when the adapter does come out, I can safely take the car apart and install a better stereo.

Keyless Entry - These are the worst remotes I've ever seen on a car with this feature. Again, these are programmed through the stereo, and removing the factory stereo will render the remotes useless. Even at that the remotes are of Poor quality. The range (when they work) is about 5-20 feet most times, and they typically stop working at the most inconvenient times. I have tried 2 sets of remotes, and changed the battery's a couple times as well.. GM needs to re-think this and come out with a better design.

Comfort - I bought the LS package, and also got the Heated Leather seats as well. For anyone looking to buy this car. If you are in a Cold climate, Buy the Heated seats, they warm your $%% very well...  :)

Sunroof - Too bad Chevy did not get the one that tucks under the headliner,, would have been much nicer.    :( 

Info Center - Very Cool feature. Lets you know many things like What direction you are going, Outside temp, Current Gas mileage, Average gas mileage, miles left on current tank of gas, and Gallons used since last reset...  Cool feature, but not needed...

Heater - Fan for heater works way too hard for the amount of air that comes out of the vents. Barely feel air moving at Full fan speed. But, Dual climate control is nice when passenger does not like your heat setting.

Misc - Like I said, the stereo needs to be redone. I'm in the process of changing mine. I will post pictures of what I came up with on my web site when I am done in the spring.

Hope this helps you if your looking at buying one for yourself.
