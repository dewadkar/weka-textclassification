            <b>The Potential</b>
The E320 was fully redesigned for 2003. And it shows in spades. It's a very fresh and spritely looking exterior redesign for an auto series that's been fairly conservative. You can visit www.mbusa.com/e320 to view the exterior, interior, options, Flash animation tours, etc about this vehicle. There's enough material there to get really excited about this vehicle if you've got the 50-large to afford it.

<i>Exciting Convenience Options</i>
This vehicle has many of the standards and options you'd expect of a luxury sedan at this price level. However, it's got some options available that were very intriguing to us. (However, offerings from Infiniti and Lexus have some of these unique features now, too.) 

Front seats that heat <i>and</i> cool are neat. The vehicle can utilize solar panels to ventilate itself while parked on a hot day. The remote has a summer-down option which drops all windows and opens the sunroof for hot days. There's a keyless-go option that operates on a proximity sensor in the remote. That means as you approach the vehicle you simply lift on the door latch to enter the vehicle - no key or remote action needed. Further, you simply press a Start button on the shifter to start the E320, all while the remote sits in your pocket. Very cool. There's also a Smart Cruise-control option that can automatically brake to maintain a preset distance to vehicles ahead. Similarly there's a Parktronic feature to assist via chirping beeps when you're trying to parallel park. 

So, you can see why someone would be very interested in the E320 as their luxury vehicle. Some of the typical standard luxury features that it has in common with all other vehicles is leather seating, premium sound with CD changer, power and memory seats, and dual-zone climate control. Quizically missing though is a navigation option.

<b>The Squandering</b>
Having said all that, we were greatly disappointed during the test drive. After adding options and other miscellanea you're looking at spending 60-large on the E320. You should be ecstatic with your vehicle at that price, not torqued off. First, the powertrain is impotent, it's pathetic. It sports a 3.2L (hence 320) 220-hp V6 that <i>should</i> rock, but instead it sleeps. Throttle response is non-existent and that's a <b>show stopper</b>. I'm simply amazed that MB would permit this type of pathetic performance. It's main design problem is that it's a single overhead cam whereas most other vehicles in its class are double overhead cam'ed and/or supercharged.

Additionally distressing is the dash design. Most vehicles have two large analog gauges for the speedometer and tach surrounded by auxillary gauges for fuel, coolant temp, etc. Baffingly, MB puts an analog clock in one of those two positions! What the heck is that about ?! There's only two auxillary guages - the fuel and coolant temp. You no longer have a guage for oil pressure and the charging system. 

In what should be a cool feature that turns into a nightmarish one, is that they've incorporated a complex menuing scheme into the steering wheel to access various display options. This causes more dangerous distraction than any display benefit it provides. Bad, bad design. 

Finally, the cruise control exists on its own stalk like an afterthought - like a design engineer at the very end realized they forgot to put it on the turn signal stalk. Now, to add further confusion, they put it on the same side as the turn signal stalk and above it! So when you're trying to turn you first hit the cruise control stalk instead!! What are these people thinking ?!! Were they using high school interns to design this vehicle ?!

<b>Final Thoughts</b>
We followed up by test driving the E500, a 5L V8. Now <i>that</i> has throttle response! But you're tossing $8k more for performance that should be included at the E320 level. And a V8 is going to guzzle your premium-octane gas, too. I'll betcha in year two or three of the E320 they'll improve its throttle response - they've got to. Hopefully, they'll redesign the dash, too, but I doubt that. So much potential.....

Good bye, Mercedes. We're looking to <b>Infiniti's M45</b> and <b>FX45</b> brand new models to satisfy our luxury vehicle itch. I'll be reporting on those as we complete their test drives.
