            After about 3 months, off and on, we had finally made our decision on the MPV.  We saw what all the mini vans in the market had to offer, and the MPV has the most.  Almost all the vans have removable seats. However, when you make a trip, you have to make the decision to remove the seat, or keep it, at the start, and live with it for the entire trip. With the MPV, the 3rd row of seats allows you the best of both worlds (the seat folds down in the bottom).  Also the second row allows you the option of the captain chairs, or bench seating.  Both adjustments are very easy to make.  In addition, the sliding doors have windows that roll down, which is a definite plus.

We bought the ES, which has many upgrades, including a great sound system. We also got the 4 seasons, 6 disc CD, and  power moon roof.  With the rebate of $1,000, we were able to purchase our ES $1,468 under invoice.  The best part, we never had to negotiate in a dealership.  We sent a fax to several dealers and began the process that way.  We did our research and homework, and would strongly suggest checking the Fighting Chance website.  It has some good suggestions.  We also experienced a very professional and polite salesperson in Austin, TX.  Even though we did not buy from him, he gave very aggressive pricing without being pushy.  We bought in the Houston area, however, if you are near Austin, I suggest you contact Adel Sala, at Mazda South (512-462-3131).

The MPV drives great.  Even though it is smaller than other's, it still seems very roomy inside.  The accent details enhance the comfort and experience.  I was a little concerned with the smaller engine, however, we have not experienced any appreciable lack of power.

After looking at all the minivans, we do not regret our choice.  I think anyone needing to &quot;play taxi&quot; or making several out of town family trips would enjoy the MPV.  

If you have a need to pull a trailer or transport 5 or 6 full size adults or large teenagers, this may not be big enough for you.  Otherwise, I think the MPV gives you more quality for the dollar.
