              <b>During the 1990s</b> the Chevrolet Impala came with one of the most powerful V8 engines available in the large sedan market. Unfortunately for the muscle car enthusiast, and fortunately for the affordable family car enthusiast, the Impala nameplate made a transitional comeback after it's demise in 1997 for the 2000 model year as a mid sized family car. The once '<a href="/content_50471079556"> large modified Caprice Classic' known as the Chevrolet Impala</a>, was now smaller, had a smaller engine line-up, cost much less, was mass produced, and lost the overall excitement of its predecessor. Despite losing many of its out-right performance characteristics, and exclusivity rights, the 2000 Impala still offers many noteworthy automotive attributes for the 2000 model year, only this time in family car fashion.

<b>For the 2000 Model year</b>, the re-introduced Chevrolet Impala (replacement for the progressively refined, yet still undesirable Chevy Lumina) comes in 2 trim lines, base (tester) and LS. Engines include an OHV 3.4 V6 (tester equipped) that pumps out 180 horsepower at 5,200 RPM, and the 'famous for reliability' OHV 3.8 (3800 series) V6 that pumps out an even more healthy 200 HP and 225 lb-ft of torque. While the LS gets the 3.8 as standard equipment, the 3.8 is only optional for the base, an almost $1,000 dollar option at that. Transmissions include a precise 4-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed manual is not available on either model. 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  Compared to the 3.1 in the Chevrolet Lumina; the Impala's predecessor, the base Impala seems like a road rocket. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> may not be up to par with V6 modeled Honda Accord's, but this car has enough grunt to scoot from the light with no fuss whatsoever. Amazingly with this being an OHV engine, the 3.4 idles almost as smooth as the much more advanced V6 in the Accord, ditto that of the Camry. Engine behavior on take-off is your typical V6 variety, no severe wheel spinning under full throttle, and no huge surge of power, however there is a surplus of power on hand when needing to get up to speed as quick as possible. The precise shifting fully automatic transmission plays a huge role in this car's good acceleration. Unlike the transmission in the <a href="/content_75710631556"> Ford Taurus</a>, the transmission in the Impala shifts like a pro, allowing for both seamless shifts through town, on the freeway, and while climbing steep hills, etc.

  While the Impala LS comes with a sport tuned suspension,  my base modeled tester came with the soft sprung standard suspension. While <b>handling</b> is not great in the base Impala, it's not poor neither. I actually found the soft sprung set-up to be more accommodating on long trips, and especially compliant with the character of this family car. Like the Lumina back in the early 1990s, the Euro Sport suspension just didn't seem to suit the rest of the car's performance offerings. Through twisty situations the 2000 base Impala tends to lean, and significant body roll can be felt on turns at high speeds, but this car was obviously not made for high speeds on twisty roads. Even with the LS's sport suspension for 2002, this car does not handle that great, the ride just seems more jarring on rough surfaces than the base models.

<b>Note:</b> Traction control is available.

<b>Cruising</b> in the 2000 base Impala, while not as refined as it's Japanese competition, still has an edge over cars like the Ford Taurus, and it's predecessor; the Chevy Lumina.  Cruising over bumps at high and low speeds can be felt, but nowhere near as much as in the Ford Taurus. Wind, engine, and roadgrain noise are all isolated from occupants inside the cabin. The only minor annoyance would be slight wind noise at speeds above 75 MPH. Hills are taken very well, and with much more authority that one would imagine. This relatively small engine is rated at only 180 horse power at 5,200 RPM and 205 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 RPM yet has no trouble, even in high gear moving this 3,400lb vehicle up the steepest inclines without having to down-shift or struggle. 

<b>Braking</b> in the 2000 Impala is excellent. Like the set-up which should be standard on all vehicles, 4-wheel discs are added to make stopping smooth, and with confidence. ABS ( a $600 option) was not available on my tester, however this did not put a hamper on excellent braking.

<b>Fuel economy</b> is excellent, unlike most cars with V6's, the 2000 Impala with the 3.4 V6 receives better fuel economy than most 4-cylinder powered family cars. At 20/32 this car gets better fuel economy than almost every V6 powered car in its class, and competes in fuel economy with cars like the <a href="/content_56290872964"> 1.5 liter Kia Rio</a>.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the 2000 Chevrolet Impala, like many GM midsized cars seems very dated and in the 2000 Chevy Impala's case, tacky to boot. The whole set-up seems very 1980s, only with better materials, which are also below millennium standards. The instrument cluster is easy enough to read, but doesn't offer a tachometer. The dash as a whole is very dated, flat, uninteresting, and the simulated tree meat that lines the center of the dash makes this interior look even more tacky instead of the 'rich' look GM was going for. To further this dated look, GM decided to make my test car a color you normally associate with what you find in a babies diaper. The interior had the same undesirable color theme that killed any sort of good looks this car potentially had going for it. On a positive note, standard amenities are abundant. A thick steering wheel, power windows, power door locks, AC, Dual air bags, and tilt steering are added, <b>www.cars.com</b> has a list of standard and optional equipment. Optional equipment on my tester included a 6 speaker cassette player with AM/FM radio, leather seating, and cruise control ( almost $2,000 in options). Ergonomics are good. The HVAC controls are well placed and the 'on dash' ignition switch makes for easy access, but can get confusing if you are used to the conventional 'on the steering wheel' ignition. 

Amenities, and ergonomics aside, the Impala's strongest asset is it's spacious cabin.The 2000 Impala seems more like a Buick Park Avenue in terms of room, than a mid sized family car. Both front and rear head and leg room supercede that of the Honda Accord, the Toyota Camry, and the Hyundai Sonata. Seating is also good, despite the leather feeling very cheap, the seats offered good support, plenty of elbow room, and good adjustments. The trunk of the 2000 Impala is huge, a family of 15 could fit a weeks worth of groceries in this car (don't quote me on that).

<b>Major interior gripes:</b> Leather feels cheap, CD player is not standard, dated dash.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

The <b>exterior</b> of the 2000 Chevy Impala, once I got past the color theme, was not exactly a masterpiece, but was no ugly duckling neither. The styling is a mix of edgy lines, and quirky body appliques, as for example the odd mix of round tail lights. Once a car (late 1999) that would stand out in any crowd, has sold so profusely, that on a drive to the mall you may pass 100 of these vehicles and never notice any of them. Tester was equipped with fancy 5-spoke alloy rims which were a 300 dollar option.

<i>Price & Reliability:</i> 

The Base 2000 Impala 'new' sold for around $20,000, with poor resale these car can be had from $12,000-$14,000 today with less than $20K miles. This makes for an excellent value. Reliability has been very good with these vehicles. Despite having an old fashioned engine, both the 3.8 and 3.4's have been very reliable according to many owners, <b>www.consumer reports.org</b> may have more info on recalls, etc.
