            We had 1998 Chevrolet Prizm LSI for 2 years.Recently we returned it back to GMC because we had SmartBuy contract. Actually it was quite sad to return it...
Folks, that's great car and I'll tell you why now:
+ It's good car for its price.It's a sister car of Toyota Corolla but cheaper. They even made on the same factory. Our car had even Toyota engine inside.Prizm is CHEAPER,folks.
+ It's very very reliable. We had no problems with it except the ignition.
(see below). We only did service,nothing else ... I never had a thought that we'll stop on the highway because of some problem with our car.
+ We had LSI model, so it has a lot of features. All the features like power windows/locks,remote entry,alloy wheels make it fun to drive.
It's very comfortable for driver and front passenger.
+ It has good gas mileage especially on the highway(up to 33mpg sometimes). 
+ And it has good horse power. Of course it's not a sporty car but no comparison to regular Honda Civic for example.
+ One more thing. Prizm is better than Chevy Cavalier, it's move comfortable and safe. Look on the Cavalier crash test results.
We encountered only 1 problem and other just a comments:
- It had ignition problem that sometimes you need to switch on/off 2-3 times before the car starts up. GMC service department couldn't fix it because it worked perfectly for them. So,we lived with it,not a big deal actually.
- It's not very convenient to seat on the back seats, but it's compact car what do you expect?

So, all together I'd recommend it either new or used. We are very satisfied with our first car!<br><br>
