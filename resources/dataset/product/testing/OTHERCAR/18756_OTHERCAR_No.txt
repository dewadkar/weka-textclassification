            I have the Isuzu Vehicross, and although I do occasionally regret the amount of money I paid for it (one can purchase just about any midsize suv for the same price) for the most part I am happy with the purchase.  Undoubtedly, this car attracts more than its share of stares, grins, etc.  But, after about a week, the attention gets real old.  I find it very difficult to drive with the stares, and the lack of concentration on where there cars are relative to mine.  Another thing is that at every red light, it appears someone wants to race me, although it is relatively quick for an SUV, it is still pretty slow for a car, and I dont really want to pound the accelerator at every light.  The car has somewhat of a rough suspension and the hood is angled so that the very front seems to get alot of nicks.   It is difficult to find very good service people for the vehicle, my dealer McKenna Motors in Huntington Beach is horrible!!!
There have been a myriad of electrical wiring problems, I have heard that other VX owners have been afflicted with this too. The CD player although very convenient, being a 6 disc in dash changer, has already broke as well.  Everything else has been discussed to death (rear visibility, access to rear seats, etc.) In closing, with all these difficulties, it is still a unique car, and I am a proud owner.  <br><br>
