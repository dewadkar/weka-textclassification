            Unfortunately, my overall impression of this camera is &quot;CHEAP&quot;.
I did extensive online research before purchasing this model, and was attracted to the raves about image quality, as well as the price (&gt;$900.00 up here in Canada)and the Nikon brand.
I was not the least bit disapointed with the image quality,(phenomenal), but I am baffled by the other aspects of the &quot;package&quot;.
If you tend to be annoyed by the little things, look elsewhere! The Nikon software package is a joke, barely usable and poorly documented, and the serial interface is yesterdays news (slow, slow, slow). Give them credit for including a light version of Photoshop 5.0.
The camera feels very cheap and plastic. The cover for the download and power adapter port feels like it will snap off in your hand every time you open it. The carrying case supplied could not possibly be any cheaper looking or offer less protection, and probably cost about 19 cents to produce. The &quot;manual&quot; has erroneous references to page numbers which do not exist, and the cd roms supplied as additional documentation are confusing and poorly organized.
The serial download cable is also bargain basement, and I have had numerous error messages resulting from the jack not seating properly in the camera.
The GOOD... as mentioned, image quality and the automatic algorithms make this camera very user friendly, and result in amazing image quality in all lighting conditions. There is no question in my mind that this is a superior camera, as far as image quality, for the price.
By the time you add on a usb card reader, decent case, rechargable batteries, AC adapter and a bigger media card, it may be prudent to search for a higher priced camera with less of the annoying drawbacks of the Coolpix 800.
I am amazed that a company with the excellent reputation of Nikon could possibly overlook so many minor details.
