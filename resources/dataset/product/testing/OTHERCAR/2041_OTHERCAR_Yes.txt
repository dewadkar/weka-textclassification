            I bought my 2001 Kia Sephia in October 2001.  The model I got came with power windows, a cassette deck, and manual transmission.  

I had never learned to drive a manual transmission, but a few friends of mine and my father were willing to teach me.  This car is great for those just learning.  Everyone who has driven this has said that this is an easy clutch to learn on, so it is great for first cars or first manual cars.

Within the first month of purchase, I had a problem with the clock turning on and off, and the radio not coming on sometimes.  I took this into the shop and a fuse had completely blown out and burnt up.  The car was under warranty and was fixed within a few hours.  

However, since that I have had no problems.  The car runs very smoothly, surprisingly smoothly for a cheap car.  I have replaced the sound system because the radio it came with wasn't great quality.  

I have since put on 26,000 miles on it (I drive a LOT for my job) and have had nothing more than an a few oil changes.  

The only complaint I have about it is that the air conditioning takes away a lot of power, but other than that, it's great!!

We took this car on a week long road trip, a friend of mine and I.  We were both comfortable in the car the entire way!  (She also learned stick shift on this car in two days!).

Gas efficiency on this car is great!  We got in the high 30's on highway driving, and low to mid 30's on city/"suburban" driving.
