            This is a great Buy.  My old car was wearing down, and it was time to get something new.  My budget was limited, but I have expensive taste. I wanted to get the most bang for the buck, so this seemed like my best option.  A very sporty, and nice truck.  Great options with Air Conditioning, automatic transmission, AM/FM Cd player. The Gas milage is great, and the Air Conditioning doesn't really affect it. The stereo sounds great.  The options are endless for aftermarket accesories.  YOu can use it as a plain old pickup, or spice it up to anything from a four wheel drive monster to a low riding sport truck.   I fully suggest this for anyone who is looking for a new truck. <br><br>
