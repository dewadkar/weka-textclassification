            Excitement it is with three different models to choose from the SE, SLE, and SSEi. This review will mainly be on the SSEi model with a 240 horsepower supercharged 3.8L V-6.

You talk about excitement the 2001 Bonneville SSEi not only handles great and has a smooth ride, it also has the horsepower to get you going. I very impressed at the power when you push down on the throttle, it felt like you had a big V-8 under the hood instead of the V-6.

Talk about sound, standard in the SSEi is an AM & FM Stereo with CD and Cassette, plus 8 Bose speakers that will give you a live concert feeling. You haven't heard anything until you hear this awesome system. 

The features that are standard for safety are impressive with dual front and side-impact air bags, front and rear anti-lock disc brakes and even a tire inflation monitor to let you know if you need to add air to any of the tires. This car is built with safety in mind.

<b>Other Standard Features</b>
You get Dual Zone Automatic Air Conditioning.

An Illuminated Keyless Remote Control for Automatic Power Door Locks and Trunk Release. An Alarm System that is activated when you use the remote to lock the doors.

Gauges for the Oil Pressure, Voltmeter, Tachometer and a gauge for the Upgraded & Supercharged Boost.

OnStar with 1-year of free service, after one year you will have to pay for the service.
               
A Rear Window Defroster, this should be standard in all cars.

A Garage Door Opener, Speed Control and Power Windows. (The garage door opener can be programmed to most garage doors.)

You get Seat Adjusters, a Dual 12-Way Power with Driver's Memory. (This means it will adjust automatically to which key is inserted.)
         
 Lights: Automatic Headlamp Control, Daytime Running Lights, Fog Lights, Cargo Compartment and more.   
 
Mirrors: Dual Heated Power with Memory plus Dual Illuminated Visor Vanity & Inside Automatic Day & Night rearview mirror.                 
                      
A Rear Spoiler and more, the spoiler gives it that extra touch for the sporty look. 

 <b>Compared with the other two Models</b>
Base price without destination charge for the SSEi is $32,415, the SLE is $28,045 and the SE is $25,075.

The SSEi has a 240 horsepower supercharged 3.8L V-6, the other two have a 205 horsepower 3.8L V-6. All three come with 4-speed electronically controlled automatic                                    transmission and the SSEi comes with a heavy-duty version with overdrive.

Gas mileage on the SSEi is 17-MPG city and 28-MPG on the highway, the other two models have equal gas mileage of 19-MPG city and 30-MPG on the highway. The fuel tank on all three has a capacity of 18.5 Gal. 

The SSEi and SLE have 17" wheels and tires and the SE comes with 16" wheels and tires.

The SSEi has a lot of extra features that are standard over the SLE and SE that you have to pay extra on the SLE and SE.

<b>Overall</b>
This is a sharp looking car that looks sportier than luxurious on the outside, though it is very luxurious and has anything you could think of in a car of this size. Yes it is nice and roomy inside and very attractive to the appearance. 

It comes with a GM standard warranty of 3 years or 36,000 miles bumper to bumper with the same on free 24-hr Roadside Assistance. Rust through warranty is 6 years or 100,000 miles which ever comes first.
