            I purchased my 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GS because I had always wanted to own a convertible. This was a decision I would make again. The first thing I must say is that I am constantly getting compliments on the car. During the summer when I'm driving with the top down, heads are turning and people get a smile on their face. I've had several women come up to me and express their appreciation of the car. If I had to do it all over again the only thing that I'd change is that I would get the leather seats. I just think it looks sharper.

I've owned Honda's before and have to admit that the Eclipse doesn't handle as well as a Honda nor is it made better. That's not to say that it's a poor handling car, just that if you've driven a Honda before you will notice the difference. I've had a couple of instances on the Eclipse where nuts and bolts in the interior will loosen and fall out and have had the retractable antenna get stuck in the up position. All of these have been minor problems on a vehicle I'm proud to own.

The top converts easily and this car does handle nicely in the corners. I get about 23 miles per gallon and I consider this to be good.

Basically, if you're into cars for their looks this one is made for you. If you're looking for the best value and quality I might look somewhere else. It's a shame that they took the Spyder Convertible out of the current offering of their vehicles.

Parents, get this as a used car for your kids and they'll love ya' forever.<br><br>
