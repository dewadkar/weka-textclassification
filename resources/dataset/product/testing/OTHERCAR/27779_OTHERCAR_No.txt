            I bought this the S100 (aka Digital Elph) in January 2001 for my wife.  She wanted an Elph camera - for it's small size and convenience - and I refused to go back to film (especially APS film).  I have been using digital since 1997 when I bought my first Olympus in Hong Kong for $1400 :(  

Not yet two years into having this camera, I felt I need to write a negative review on this model to dissuade anyone else from buying it used (or dog-forbid, new?).  I am replacing it with another camera this month, which I'll write a review about elsewhere - you can check my profile to see which one.

Quite simply the camera has not held up.  In the first three months, we noted that the camera did not take pictures as we framed them in the view finder.  My wife called Canon-USA and they told her that this was common in small camera - something called the Paralax effect.  I have not noted this ever before in small cameras and in fact two of our friends have newer models of the Digital Elph with no problem like this.  It is so bad that we have to give instructions to anyone who uses the camera to line up the subjects on the left hand side of the viewfinder window, otherwise the picture comes out off center. This has been very annoying and is the reason why either my or I are always behind the camera.  Canon-USA said - less than 90 days into owning the camera - that we could send it back to them in California and for around $100 they would take a look at it.

The 2nd thing that has happened is that the zoom has stopped working.  We don't really even use it that much.  We have a carrying case for the camera and somehow the zoom lever does not work anymore.

The final straw was that the compact flash door hinge broke and now the door won't stay on - exposing the compact flash to the world.  I think they've fixed this on newer models - this door is made of cheap plastic.

Which is another annoying this, in less than two years there have been 6 new models (S100, S110, S200, S210, S300, and now S330)!  I am all for innovation, but this makes you wonder how bad each old model is.  The big difference between the S100 and the 200 model on is that it did not have a movie mode, which I find ridiculous.  The compact flash storage is not enough to capture much of anything and the quality is horrible.  If people want motion pictures, they should be a DV or Hi-8 camcorder.  Most of those can do stills as well as motion.

In short, as much as my wife loved always having her camera with her in her purse or pocket, this $499 purchase did not hold up long enough to justify it's existence.
