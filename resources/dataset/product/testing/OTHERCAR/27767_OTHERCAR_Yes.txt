            I've been wanting to get a digital camera for a while, because it's convenient and I've been using Zing.com quite a bit to post pictures to share with friends and family. I want a good quality camera but I don't think I need a 3.3Mpixels, 2.1 is a good price/quality point. I read reviews and specs on a few cameras and decided to go with Canon, mainly because I'm a big Canon 35mm SLR fan (owned the ElanIIe for 5 years, got it when it first came out), and I also have the APS Elph Jr (got it as a birthday gift) and I love them.

First, this camera looks GOOD! It's silver which matches my ElanIIe and my Elph Jr, and it's the same size as its APS brother. It's very easy to use, I never had to read the manual. I'm very pleased with the quality of the pictures. It comes with a lot of useful software and I like the USB PnP functionalities. My girlfriend *loves* this camera, definitely a really cool toy.

I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery, this saves me a lot of money, and the battery charger is really cool.

However, there is a few disadvantages:

NO CAMERA CASE! my digital elph costs around $100 and it came with a case that fits the camera perfectly, I can't believe a $500 camera can't include a case! However the digital elph fits in the elph jr's case.

8MB is not enough, need to get a 32MB SanDisk flash card, ($60 at Amazon)

No power adapter, it'd be useful to have one, but not really necessary.

If you go on trips and likes using the LCD to take pictures, u'd definitely need an extra rechargeable battery.<br><br>
