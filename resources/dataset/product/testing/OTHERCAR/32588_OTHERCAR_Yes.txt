            Purchased this vehicle (1997 SL2) used at the Saturn dealer. Excellent purchasing experience. No haggle pricing even with used vehicle but they still lowered the price by another thousand dollars! Test drove the 1996 VW Jetta, 1996 Honda Civic, and 1997 Toyota Corolla. I didn't buy the VW because it was too high priced or the Honda because there are too many on the road and I didn't like the snobby attitude of the Honda dealers. The Toyota was out of the question because of it's poor acceleration and small back seat. 

Interior Appointments:
Leather seating with driver's lumbar support.  A/C and heat use slider controls that are not lit for night use.  Definitely a disadvantage.  Power mirrors, variable power assisted steering, power windows, power moonroof, tilt wheel, AM/FM Stereo with CD player, with driver and passenger airbags.  Also, the rear seats fold down in a 60/40 split for additional cargo space.  Trunk space with the seats up is approximately 12 cu. ft.  This is similar to the other cars that I tested.  With the rear seats down, I can easily fit a road bike flat in the cargo area.  Rear seating for a car of this size is not bad.  There is enough room for two six-footer back there for a short trip.  The EPA rated passenger volume is 91 cu. ft.  Approximately the same size as a Mercedes Benz 190E.    

Exterior Appointments:
I like the dent-resistant doors and actually kicked the doors with my foot to prove to friends that they are really dent resistant.  Factory 15 inch alloy rims are standard but no locking gas cap door.   

Drivetrain:
This car has a 1.9L multi-valve four-cylinder engine that pumps out 124hp and 122ft/lbs. of torque for a 2400lb. car.  0-60 times are in the 8.5-9.0 second range with an automatic which is what I have.  When this engine is pressed hard, it emits a loud clatter that is not very refined.  This engine also has a real timing chain in the engine unlike the other cars I tested that come with a timing belt that needs to be replaced every 60-75K miles. This car's timing chain is self-adjusting and should last the life of the car. The car which uses regular is rated for 24 city, 34 highway.  For my experience with the car, I would say Saturn is correct.  One fault I was say to the design engineers at Saturn is why did they design an oil filter that once removed, must always spill oil right on the lower control arm every time?  This always makes added work for a DYI person in cleanup.  The automatic transmission on this car is very smooth.  Downshifts are very precise.  There are no abrupt shifts like some other cars that I have driven.    

Noise Level:
People have discussed about the noise level in this car on several different forums. I don't notice any difference comparing it to the Honda or Toyota. Only the VW was quieter. My sound level meter registered 74dB on the highway.  Using sound deadening materials such as DynaMat brought the noise level down to 71dB.  

The Drive:
This cars actually feels like it is on rails with its SL2 suspension.  Very little body lean and because the car is relatively light, is easy to toss around.  The only downside to this suspension is its absorption of harsh road bumps.  You will feel as if you bottomed out the suspension from time to time.  On short trips, the seats are supportive and the ride on the highway is similar to other economy cars.  For longer trips, the seats will feel somewhat uncomfortable because of their low position.  You will feel as if you are almost sitting on the floor.  The variable assisted steering actually works extremely well.  Little assist on the highway, lots of assist while parking.  Most cars should have this type of assisted steering in place rather than the one level of power steering most car manufacturers use.  If you had to replace one thing on this car for increased performance, it would have to be the stock Firestone tires that Saturn provides.  They squeal like a pig everytime you even think about making a turn.  Yes they are that bad.  Once I replaced them with Avid H4s, the squeal went away and the noise level on the highway dropped 2dB to 69dB.  

Maintenance:
This car is very inexpensive to maintain.  Parts for this car are much less expensive than any of the foreign car manufacturers.  I had a window regulator go out and replacing it only cost $80.00 which included the labor time.  

Conclusions:
So if you are like me who needs an economical car to commute to work with that is comfortable to drive for short trips and you have tendencies to break out once in a while to drive like a sports car driver, check out the Saturn.
