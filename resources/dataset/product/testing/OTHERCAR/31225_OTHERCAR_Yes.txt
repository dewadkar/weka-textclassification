                Recently, Chrysler Corp. began a road show where potential customers are able to test drive any Chrysler product on what is a "real" test course.  For the Jeep camp, that meant a on-road course that compared the Liberty and Xterra in acceleration and braking tests, tight turning, speed bumps, pot holes, and a slolom course.  It also meant driving the Liberty on a real off-road course.  
    I was extremely impressed with the off-road capability of the Liberty.  This course included, hill climbs, steep tilts to the left and right, steep climbs and descents, log bridges, rock beds and a hill called Mt. Jeep.  Mt. Jeep is roughly 40 ft high and has a 40 deg. pitch up followed immediately by a 63 deg. pitch down the other side.  In the climb, the Liberty showed nothing but complete control over the hill, on the descent, simply letting go of the brakes and steering allowed the transmission to maintain a safe descent speed to the bottom.  I have been off road many times in my Cherokee and the Liberty can do anything my Cherokee can do and more.  It also does it more comfortably. 

    I am a current Cherokee owner and I am trading in for the new Liberty Renegade this month.  

    When compared to the Xterra, I found a more comfortable ride, better handling and braking (the Xterra was sluggish on both) and a nicely appointed interior.  The Liberty is that vehicle that allows you to drive to a nice dinner with friends on Friday and then go do some real off-road driving on Saturday morning with out missing a beat.  

    The Liberty does have a few cons.  First, it is an SUV and has the normal SUV gas milage.  Although, it is better with the available 4 cyl. engine, you will most likely want the power and torque of the V6.  The 4-wheel anti-lock brakes (which stop smoothly on a dime from 50-0 mph) are not standard.  They will run just under $500 as an option but they are well worth the cost.  Also side curtain air bags are not standard.  

    The Liberty has many Pros though.  To name a few, the new 7-year, 100,000 mile warranty will keep you covered longer than the competition.  The new Powertech V6 gives ample power and torque. The swinging tailgate is a much needed improvement over the old swing-up tailgate of the past. With new options and models (like the Renegade) coming down the line, it will be easy to make your Liberty your own.
