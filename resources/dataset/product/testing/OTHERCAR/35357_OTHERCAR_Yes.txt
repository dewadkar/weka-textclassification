<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>Could live in seats<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>The performance and handling are OK.  Nothing exciting. The main reason to buy this car is for its safety, comfort, and spaciousness. If you want top performance and handling, this is not the car for you.<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>The car feels very strong and well built and its safety features are what caused me to buy this car.<br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>I bought this car used 2 years ago when it had 61,000 miles for $15,300 which was below blue book value at that time. <br>

What I like best about this car:
1. The very comfortable and roomy seats. 
2. Spacious interior with great all around window visibility.
3. A very solidly built car - it feels tough and very safe.
4. Great paint job and sporty good looks.
5. Excellent trunk space.

What I dislike about this car:
The sluggish performance. I guess this is to be expected since it only has 168 horsepower. Compared to my wife's 2001 Volvo V70T5 with a 247 horsepower high pressure turbo engine, driving this car is like driving a bus. Ok its not that bad and it is an unfair comparison. But still, the acceleration of this car is average/mediocre at best due to its smaller engine power.
This is a bad enough drawback for me personally that I am currently actively looking for a car with more zip to replace it. I love Volvos so it will probably be a used Volvo with a turbo charged engine.

Repairs needed for the past two years of ownership:
1. Air conditioning recharge.
2. Driver power seat controls/mechanism broke.
3. New brakes needed.

Who this car would be perfect for:
1. Teen drivers - because of the mild acceleration and the high level of protection it gives its occupants. 
2. Any one who is interested in a great car and doesn't care about acceleration performance.<br><br>
