            First of all I would like to thank all the reviewers for the 2002 Galant.  I trust most of your experiences.

Well, I would like to say that the Galant is a car just itching to pounce on a MUCH larger share of the market.  howeever, mitsu engineers need first to turn this car from a very good one into an excellent one, like the new Camry.  I put the Galant above the current Accord but below the new Camry.  Well, let me break it down, with frequent comparos with the Accord and Camry.

     Price:  The Galant comes well equipped for the price, but the Camry and Accord follow close behind.  Dealer incentives are the x factor, so this comes to a tie.  1 point awarded to all three.

    Styling:  I like the Galant's styling all around.  I own one in deep creamy red, imagine it as a lipstick color, and all I can say is DANG!  The new Camry looks good as well, but its more "passive beautiful" like a woman you can never have.  Anyway, forget about the Accord.  Galant gets 1 point.

     Engines/Transmission:  I can only speak for the 4 cylinders on all 3 as they are the only ones i have driven.  The Galant's engine/auto trans. combo are GREAT, with only one quibble: no overdrive for better coasting.  The new Camry 4 is equally matched.  The accord's vtec 4 with auto trans. is good, but a little noisy.  Galant and Camry get one point each.

      Quietness:  The galant has a very hushed interior, similar to the camry's but quieter than the accord's.  Good work mitsubisi.  Galant and Camry earn 1 point.

     Comfort:  The galant's comfort is good enough for trips and commutes alike, but still not refined like the camry, about the same as the accord. Galant's rear seating position is too much slanted back, but is still ok. Camry earns 1 point.

     Ergonomics:  (dont judge ergonomics too harshly) Well folks this is where Mitsubishi engineers need to concentrate when they redo the Galant.  Too many minor foibles, like the cupholder setup (armrest interferes), no grab handles, no keyhole on passenger side, cloth should not be on the inside of the doors (get dirty), would like more and better designed storage capabilities.  Otherwise, Mitsubishi got the rest down.  Camry ergo is better of course, and Accord ergo is just a little bit better.  Camry earns 1 point.

      Roominess:  Front room is comparable in all 3.  Galant's rear is roomier than it looks, but still can be improved.  Camry's rear is excellent.  Accord room was about the same as the Galant.  Camry earns 1 point.

      Reliability:  Galant reliability has a good bit of uncertainty (not in a bad way, just not many owners responding on surveys to gauge an accurate response) but is still great as far as I can see.  I bought mine with 12000 miles and the car has no problems after a few thousand miles.  Camry reliability is more defined and is excellent, but the Accord seems to take the cake here.  Accord reliability is squeaky clean. Accord earns 1 point.

      Entry/exit: rear entry/exit is a little bit hard on Galant, but Accord has its quirks too.  Camry is all around good here.  Camry earns 1 point.

      Sound system:  Mitsu system is 140 watts (not 100 watts like the other reviews might say, see mitsu site for actual specs) and sounds great.  It simply boasts more power than the other two.  Galant earns 1 point.

      Fit and finish:  all 3 i saw had good fit and finish.  1 point for all three.

P.S.  On Galant, watch out for $100 spare keys (cause they are computerized)

Tally:  Camry 8 points,  Galant 6 points,  accord 3 points

I like the Galant best however, because it has, as George W. Bush would say, "character"
