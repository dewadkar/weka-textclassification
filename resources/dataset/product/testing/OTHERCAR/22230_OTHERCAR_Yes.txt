            Need a higher performance cruising machine for less than $200,000? Here you go. In a year old version of a Motor Trend they compared the M Roadster with the Aston Martin DB7, Corvette Coupe, Viper GTS, Ferrari 355 F1, Lotus Esprit V-8 Turbo, Panoz AIV Roadster and Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe. Although the M Roadster wasn't the top perform it was very impressive when compared to these high cost machines. The M Roadster is the &quot;Quickest BMW Ever Sold in America&quot;! It hits 60 in a mere 5.2 ticks on the stop watch. Slide yourself in the cockpit and you will be in heaven. Nice, soft leather completely surrounding you with a 3.2L I-6 M engine sitting below the hood. Unfortunately many people mistake the M's for Z's. The differences between the Z's and the M are:
1. Engine - M=3.2L I6    Z's=2.5L or 2.8L I6

2. Styling Areas - The M has some different areas of Style than the Z's:
3 Air Intakes and twin chin spoilers and chrome side gills are all unique to the M

3. Suspension - The M has the M Suspension when the Z has the cheaper version of the standard suspension

4. Options - Comes with everything except a Center Console with cup holders and coin holders as a no priced option.

5. Wheels - M Styled Wheels

6. Brakes - Larger Disc Brakes

7. Tires - Large and Z Rated

The M Roadster provides Acceleration, Handling, and Looks that no one else has. The M also boasts a intensely beautiful interior. Every thing is right where it should be just like it is on all BMW's. There is little wind in the 2 seats. If you want NO wind you can pick up a wind deflector but it isn't really needed. There is little to complain about this car. Trunk space is fine with me because I bought this car as a weekender and most do. It holds 1 small suit case and a duffel bag which is perfect for going on a short adventure. There are 2 things I don't like about the interior:
1. No Audio Controls on Steering Wheel
2. I don't like the Analog Clock
Other than that it is perfect to have for a weekend car. If you have $42,700 and are willing to search for one you like, are very flexible or want to wait 5-7 months you are in luck because this is your car. It sticks to the road like glue. Its tire screaming acceleration, handling and styling make it my favorite roadster.<br><br>
