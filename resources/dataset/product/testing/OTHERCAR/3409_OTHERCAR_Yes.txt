            We got our Suburban at a steal!  We own a body shop and happend upon on my beautiful black beast at a great price!  I can haul all the kids, my hubby, and my dogs at the same time!  It handles great!  Plenty of space and an extra seat if I need to seperate the kids or we just have extra passengers.  It will haul large items on the interor, tow just about anything (we do alot of camping-travel trailer style).  Mine has 4 wheel drive so we can go all terain driving if the mood strikes us!  Wouldn't trade it for the world.<br><br>
