            When my 1986 Dodge 600 sputtered its last breath in the middle of the night on a bridge in Philadelphia, I knew it was time to start looking for a new car because it quickly became clear that the price to fix the car would be considerably higher than its value. I didn�t want to admit this was the end. I mean, after all, this is the car the took me and my fianc� 8,000 miles cross-country in a month and this is the car that also took a bullet for me-<b>literally.</b> I didn�t want to give it up, but in addition to the cost, I wanted something that would look nice, be reliable and with features that actually work. Even before the final breakdown of the Dodge, key things such as the air conditioning, door locks and window handles had ceased to function.

While spending two hours on the train each way to work (compared to a 20 minute drive) I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted. Before going to any dealers there were a few things that I had to determine: my price range, what options I wanted, whether to lease or finance and how much I could afford as a down payment. I decided to finance a four door compact car that had an automatic transmission, power windows/locks/mirrors, a CD player and plenty of room.

I did a lot of research online and was able to narrow my choices down to three cars: the Hyundai Accent, the Toyota Echo and the Kia Sephia. When I actually made my first series of dealer visits, I promptly discovered that the Accent GL was the car for me. Compared to the others, the Accent offers almost all the features I wanted standard and the upgrade options were inexpensively packaged together. Plus, the Echo and Sephia just seemed to be cheaply made.

My discussion of the Accent deals with the car itself and not the purchasing process. I�m lucky enough to have an awesome brother, <i>ramblerman</i> who handled the negotiations for me. I didn�t know the first thing about dealing with car salesmen, but I know I got an excellent price. Plus, I got to learn how the entire process works. Hopefully, he�ll write a review on the negotiating end of this purchase soon.

<b>Driving the Accent</b>
My test drive of the Accent was wonderful. The car handles smoothly and has a lot of energy for a 1.6 L engine. Keeping up with traffic, merging and turning quickly were all a breeze. Every knob and button is within easy reach, so I didn�t feel distracted from the road. Trunk and gas release handles are conveniently located on the floor right next to the driver�s seat which is nice. Also, compared to my old rumbly Dodge, the Accent�s engine is super quiet. The brakes are excellent and the car stops on a dime. In addition, it was nice not to feel as though I was sitting on the dash like I felt behind the wheel of the Toyota Echo. Overall, I felt completely at ease driving the Accent. 

<b>The Interior</b>
The bucket seats are comfortable and can be adjusted for height, lumbar support and more. My 6-foot tall fianc� had plenty of legroom on the passenger side while I, at 5�5� tall, could easily pull the driver�s seat way up. He also liked the fact that the passenger seat completely reclines for snoozing during long trips. I enjoyed the driver�s seat armrest that folds up or down as well as the adjustable height of the seat belts (no more choking no the seat belt because I�m so short and it crosses my neck). I also tested out the back seat where the legroom is average. With the driver�s seat pulled up to my satisfaction, there is plenty of room, but with the seat moved farther back there is little to no legroom. This is fine for me, as I rarely have passengers in the back for anything more than a short trip.

To be completely honest, one of the most important options for me was a decent CD player. I�ve never had one in a car before, and as a music editor and top reviewer here at epinions you can guess just how important music is to me! I found that the Accent offers an upgrade option called the �power package� which adds power windows, locks and mirrors and well as a CD player to the car. Everything else comes standard, so getting this package was an easy decision and the sound quality is great!

<b>The Exterior</b>
The Accent has a fairly standard exterior for cars in its general price range. It comes in a four door sedan or a two door hatchback. I opted for the four door as I hate having to get out of the car each time someone needs to get into the back seat. My car has a spoiler on the back which makes its look a bit sportier. The side mirrors flip toward and away from the car, which means they are less likely to be broken if hit. The trunk of the car is roomy and came with a cargo net to hold loose items. The back seats also have 60/40 fold down access into the trunk to make transporting larger items easier.

<b>Why I Bought It</b>
I knew that I wouldn�t be getting an ultra-cool sports car for the amount of money I had to spend. Still, I feel good driving the Accent and in black with a spoiler it doesn�t make me look like a grandma on the road. The price is cheaper than its contemporaries and you get more for your money. I didn�t have to pay thousands extra for power options, air conditioning or a CD player.

Hyundai cars also come with an excellent standard warranty of 10 years/100,000 mile power train, 5 years/60,000 mile bumper to bumper, and 5 years road side assistance. This offers me a lot of peace of mind as I don�t have to worry about being stranded somewhere or paying lots of money for repairs.

Ultimately, I am extremely happy with this purchase. It�s daunting to know that I will be paying for this car for the next five years of my life, but I�m confident I made a good choice. I would highly recommend the Accent to first time buyers as well as anyone looking for an inexpensive car in general. I easily fell in love with my new Accent GL-You won�t be disappointed either.
