            Talk about reliability!!!  I've only had this car for about 9 months, and i haven't been in the shop once for repairs.  Even if something was wrong the lifetime of my lease is covered under the bumper to bumper warranty.  It is great on gas, and is strong enough to keep up with the V-6's and V-8's on the road.  This little car has excellent pickup as well, all you need is a little tap on the accelerator and &quot;zoom&quot;, this baby flys.  Even when you need to pass those fancy BMW's and Mercedes.  It is a joy to drive and takes you from here to there in comfort and style.  

Andre (that's his name) is a 2000 two door coupe.  I actually look foward to driving him.  I would definately recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive car with the zip and attitude of a much more dignified luxery car.  Especially for under 200 a month (lease with no power windows, locks, etc.).

I will say that there is one flaw worth mentioning.  It doesnt have the best handling ever.  Especially in the rain, you have to drive slow and carefully because one sharp turn will make you feel like this little car is slip sliding all over the road.  <br><br>
