            What I Enjoy About This Car
The Camaro is fun to drive as well as respected by any true American. Mine has always started easily and accelerated flawlessly (except when the plugs and wires went bad at 40K miles).  The Camaro is one of Chevrolet's greatest reasons for being the "Heartbeat of America".

Value
The Camaro is by far the best value in this class.  The biggest factor that precludes me from moving up to a Corvette (which I'm not saying is in the same class) is they sell for thousands over dealer invoice, while the Camaro can often be purchased for little over the dealer invoice (go to www.edmunds.com for dealer invoice and used car values).

Engine
The 3.8 liter 231 cubic inch V6 is a proven reliable motor.  Since its bump to 200 horsepower with the 1996 model year, it is also a proven performer.  With the 5-speed, quarter-mile times are under 16 seconds (15.7 if I remember correctly) and passing comes with ease.  

Handling
The standard suspension on the Camaro, while comfortable for everyday cruising, is not suitable for slalom.  For this, the more capable Z28 or SS suspension is needed.

Fuel Economy
In town, low 20's
On highway, consistently 26-27

Reliability
In 36,000 miles, I have not had a single problem.  Few squeaks or rattles, still very quiet for city or highway driving.  And the t-tops don't leak!

Insurance Cost
While many people complain about the cost of insuring a Camaro, I have had better experience.  Geico charges me little more to insure my Camaro than my wife's Monte Carlo.  6 months insurance for the two run $572; I'm 30 and she's 28 with a clean record.

Depreciation
One con of this car is they depreciate as quick or quicker than other domestic cars.  While based on the quality of the car this is slightly unfair, many are treated badly or not kept in repair.  Therefore, look for used cars owned by people secure in their income, hopefully first owners of the car.

Why I Purchased the Car
I have loved the Camaro since I was a teen.  While the late 60's and early 70's cars were great muscle cars, the later cars' air conditioning and disk brakes are very important for comfort and safety.

Talk of Discontinuing the Camaro and Firebird
While this was a valid concern, the last I heard, the models will be continued through at least model year 2003.  Now quit buying that (*&$#) SUV's and buy a sports car!
