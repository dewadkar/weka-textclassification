            oh yeahh, cruising in my new RX brings a smile to my face  =)  The car looks soooo stylish and attractive outside and inside.  I always see people staring at it and admiring it as they walk by.  The main reason i bought this car is that i wanted a suv vehicle w/a car feel.  This is exactly it.  The feel of driving it is sooo smooth and easy.  For one thing, it is made by Lexus, so the quality is nothing but the best, but some people tend to forget about how great their service is.  After I bought the car, i needed some paint for my bumper cuz i scratched it (my heart was broken) so i went to the dealer they gave me a bottle for free, my tires looked like it needed some air so i went to the dealer and they pumped it up for me right away, hassle free, and of course for free.  The service is just incredible, they are willing to  help you anytime and the people are so friendly.  But the  feel of the car while driving it is just tooo lovable which instantly caught my attention.  

 I've had this vehicle for half a year now, i love to drive it cuz it just feels good, simple as that.  It looks good first of all, and it feels good thats why i really enjoy driving it.  The feel of the leather, ease of the steering wheel, great looking interior, big mirrors, it's sooo quiet and peaceful,great for driving, long and short distances, excellent. 

Love  - driving feel, interior, spacious, exterior look, Name,i'm         probably missing others but there really is a lot to love about this car

HATE - just that it doesn't have as much power as other big SUVs, but then again, it's more of a car than a SUV


Bottom line, if you're looking for a SUV w/a car feel and smoothness, ya gotta get the RX 300, if you're looking for a SUV w/a lot of power and ruggedness, the RX 300 is not for you.     <br><br>
