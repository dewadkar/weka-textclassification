            When looking for a car, I did my research.  I was not about to drop a pile of cash on the first car I looked at.  After a thorough review of all the available cars in the price range, and many, many test drives, I chose the Accent, and here's why:

<i>First impression:</i>
Firstly, it doesn't look or feel like a cheap car.  It has many of the details of a more expensive car.  Many of the vehicles I looked at in the price range simply looked cheap.

The Accent has a fairly roomy interior.  I'm 6'0", and I don't have a major issue with head or legroom up front.  In the back seat, I do have a headroom issue of a couple of inches.  I can slouch a bit and I'm fine.  In the 4-door version, this problem does not appear.

<i>On to the test drive!</i>

The 1.5 L SOHC engine is strong, and the optional 1.6L DOHC is stronger yet.  With a 5-speed manual (automatic optional on some models), shifting is a breeze thanks to synchronized gears.

Acceleration is great. Not up to sports car standards, but excellent for the type of car.  Handling is good and tight.  The turning radius is very tight.  It's no problem to pull a u-turn or pull in to the tightest parking stalls, even without power steering (which is optional.)

The dealer told me that Hyundai has some of the most sophisticated wind tunnels in the world.  I believe it.  There is absolutely zero wind noise at highway speeds (and above!) in this car.

The ride is smoother than at least half of the vehicles I tested.  Although it doesn't feel like I'm driving my old 70's Cadillac, it doesn't feel like an economy car either.

The exterior mirrors are large and provide a good view.  Driver's airbag is standard, passenger's optional.  Impact beams are standard.

<i>The real test!</i>

After having the car for a month, I took a 2000 mile journey through the Canadian Rockies and back.  The car performed surprisingly well on the mountain pass.  The 1.5L engine is more than tough enough for climbing and maintaining your speed on the up slope, rarely ever shifting below 4th.  The car is comfortable enough that we were able to drive for hours without wanting to stop.

<i>Still loving it!</i>

That entire trip cost $100 (Canadian dollars) in gas.  That's roughly 42 mpg, give or take.

<i>What now?</i>

Hyundai has a 5-year bumper-to-bumper warranty with roadside assistance, and I think a 10 year powertrain warranty.  I truly believe I'm not going to have to take this in for warranty work anytime soon.  I haven't had a single problem with it, and don't suspect I will for as long as I have it.

<i>Highly recommended</i>

I would recommend this car to anybody looking for an economical car.
