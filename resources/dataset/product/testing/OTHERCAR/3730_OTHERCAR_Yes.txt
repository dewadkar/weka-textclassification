            I bought a 1996 Silverado 1500 ext. new.  It has been a very reliable and has low maintance.  I took this truck to Florida and got 18 MPG mileage.  I believe this is great mileage for a full size pickup.  Mine is also a 4x4.  It is a life saver in heavy snow.

  I have a paper delivery route and was able to make all deliveries even in 12 inches of snow.  I have also so used this truck to pull a houseboat.  Even with this load the ride was as smooth as always.  This truck is very good climbing mountain roads even with a load, it doesn't bog down.  I drove another make of truck in same conditions and didn't think i would make it to the top.

  I like the pushbutton transfer to 4 wheel drive,as opposed to having to pull a lever.  If you have arthritis in your hands as I do pushbutton makes all the difference.  If you have trouble getting in vehicles this truck has two handles to hold onto to help you get in.  there are 2 lights under the hood 1 is removable and will extend to the end of the truck.

  This is a truck for pleasure as well as hard work.  This truck is around 20,000 to 30,000 dollars depending on features you want.  If you want luxury as well as dependability this is the truck for you.     <br><br>
