            We lease a 1997 Chevy Tahoe, there are several good things about that, and a few bad.  

I'll start with what I love about this vehicle.  

First, it is HUGE!  There is enough room in the back seat for my son's carseat and both of my daughters, with room for them to &quot;not touch each other&quot; -You mom's know how important THAT IS!  The front seats are very roomy as well, with dual air bags, (which makes me feel better when the hubby drives) Also there is an extra seat belt in the middle front for one of the kid's friends if we are taking them somewhere.  

The back is great, we can haul most anything.  

The lease payments aren't bad either, only $20 per month more than lease payment of the 1994 Blazer we turned in, not bad for all of the extra room you get. 

Now the bad things..Gas.  This thing really eats the gas.  I don't know miles per gallon or anything, but I know I pump at least $35 per week in it.  The blazer only needed half as much gas.  

Insurance is higher too.  Tires are really expensive.  Everything for this vehicle costs more (mostly TWICE as much!).  

Mechanically we haven't had too many problems.  Brake pads need changing quarterly, I blame that on the Pittsburgh Hills though.  We have had some trouble with the steering, it feels really loose and the dealer has not been able to figure out why.  

The lease is up in Feb 2001, my Husband and I are considering buying it out (pending fixing the steering problem) All in all, we do really like the vehicle. <br><br>
