            I was once the proud owner of an Acura Integra LS hatchback, and it lasted for over 2 years.  I purchased the car in Spring of 1994, it was used with about 70,000 miles on the odometer.  It had never been wrecked and it appeared to be in good condition.  

1990 was the first year of this body-style.  It ran from 1990 to 1993.  And in 1990 there were 3 choices of option packages:  RS- the basic,  LS- some options like sunroof, and A/C, and the fully loaded GS- including alloy wheels, power windows/locks, and rear spoiler.  The only engine choice for 1990 was 1.8 liters, and it produced 130 hp.  It had 4 cylinders with 16 valves and dual over head cams (DOHC).  It is definitely an engine that likes high RPMs.

The Integra is a great driving car.  It is small and maneuverable, it's quick off of the line, and it handles just wonderfully.  The engine is smooth, reliable, and does pretty well with economy.  I drove this car for over 50k miles and never had an ounce of trouble with that engine.  In fact the whole car was very, very reliable.  And spent very little time in the shop.

The interior of the car is put together well.  Acura used quality materials that hold up well, and have a nice feel to them.  I didn't have any problems with squeaks or rattles.

There are a lot of things that I liked about my Integra.  And I would recommend it to almost anyone.  If you are looking for a small sporty car and a lot of interior space isn't important than I would say that it's the car for you.  If you are used to larger cars that focus on luxury and quiet rides, it might be for you, but it might not.  It would definitely be different than what you are used to.  Give it a try.

Eventually I needed a car with 4 doors, so I had to give it up.  But I would rate my whole experience with my Acura Integra as Excellent!  And would highly recommend owning one.   <br><br>
