            My wife and I have been thinking of what we are going to replace our 1997 Audi A4 with. When Infiniti announced they were bringing the G35, the North American version of the perennial Nissan Skyline sedan, it was exactly what I thought we needed. The formula is simple, stuff the powerful torquey Nissan VQ series engine at 3.5 litres, fit it into a modern style body, add bells and whistles, offer it in RWD (with AWD coming) soon, and sell at an aggressive price. The base model car is loaded with most amenities we could want for the reasonable price of around $39000 Canadian. Moonroof is available on the optional package. Sounds like a winner to me. 

So we decide to visit the dealer to check it out. I test drove the 5 speed automatic base model sedan as that is what my wife would be buying. My wife had not seen one up close, but she liked the looks. The car has a nice look to it especially the front end which straddles the line between sedan and sports car. The car doesn&#146t have the gee-whiz styling of an Lexus IS300 or the newer BMW&#146s, but it seems to say &#147I&#146m grown up, but I can play&#148. The taillights is perhaps the most unsuccessful part of the styling. This theme of splitting the tail light into the trunk lid at half height is a trick that BMW had been using, but it doesn&#146t work as well here. It just looks gimmicky to my eyes. It&#146s a large car, and that easily shows in its interior room. The wheels are stretched out to the corners, and the engine is located behind the front axle and thus opens up the space inside. Indeed Nissan calls this a Front Midship layout. This car is effectively mid-engined. Headroom was good for everybody in our non-moonroof base model, even in the backseat. The interior is a tasteful modern approach to car design. Trunk space is not exceptional at only 14 cubic feet though, but it's a rear wheel drive after all. Nice touches include the movable gauge cluster, but there are a few quirks worth mentioning. First, the materials could be better for this class of car, the interior I looked at is dark and satiny grey plastic. And it doesn&#146t have the nice finish or posh appeal as some of its rivals like Audi or Acura. And the manu-matic shifter has the manual settings on the passenger side *further* away from the driver which is backwards. The glovebox is split into two (with a lower one and a separate upper one) instead of one large compartment. On the headliner there is a way too obvious looking plastic piece marked &#147card holder&#148 which I presume is for your parking card, but it was strange that they just didn&#146t make a spot on your sun visor or console for this. The power seat controls are facing you down to the right of your driver&#146s seat, but they are exposed and I&#146d imagine could get dirty and gummed up easily with too many Starbucks coffees being spilt. If you are a skinnier person like me, you may find the seats to be a bit too wide for good support for those tight high speed corners. Seat support and bolstering could have been more aggressive given the target competition of this car (after all, Infiniti still sells the I35 for the country club crowd). No fold down seats either, just a pass-through&#133bummer. And a foot operated parking brake? That just seems wrong. All minor quirks I&#146ll admit, but worth noting. 

So the test drive begins.

The car is a quiet cruiser. The claimed aerodynamics of this car is no joke, it really does seem to slip through the wind. Even on that windy day, it felt very stable at higher speeds. The suspension is firm, there was a bit of harshness over smaller bumps, but overall ride quality was fine. The meaty tires do its best to keep the approximate 3400 lbs of car stuck in the corners. The engine noise does come though the cabin whenever you tip the throttle, even lightly (especially noticeable since the car is otherwise very silent). The steering had a slight imprecise feel to it, as if it wasn&#146t linear off center. Hard to tell for sure without more test driving, so I&#146ll leave it as an exercise for you to verify. Going into my favorite test drive corners, I overcooked it a bit on purpose, and provoked the chassis by lifting and applying the throttle. It seems to understeer at first, but as it seemed keen to oversteer when I applied the throttle, maybe even too easily. This is even with the stability control activated. The chassis seemed a bit ruffled. The roads just a little bit damp, and I was doing crazy things with the throttle, but I was surprised that the handling felt a bit unpolished. The car does have a heavy feel to it, it is definitely not the dance partner a car like my Subaru Impreza WRX is, or even the Acura TSX I test drove earlier. This car does not have the supremely balanced lively feel a BMW 3 series does, it's noticeably more ponderous coming into the corners.

Back onto normal roads, the brakes were very powerful, but they were very grabby. Even coming from my sensitive Audi brakes, I found coming to a smooth stop a bit difficult. My wife driving the same car felt the same. 

So coming out of the test drive, I was disappointed that the ideal-on-paper car wasn&#146t all that I thought it would be. Compared to its direct competition, the G35 represents good value with its complete amenties list, proven engine, interior room, modern and unique styling, and good pricing. I may have gone into it with my expectations too high, but that (FWD!) Acura TSX is looking like a better and better deal right now as our top candidate. Would you believe it, a RWD zealot like me is picking a FWD over a RWD? Strange things can happen.
