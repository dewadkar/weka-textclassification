            When I purchased my Audi, I had three major criteria (1) it had to be dependable due to my 60+ miles per day commute, (2) it had to be fun to drive yet large enough for my family of four, and (3) I didn't want to see the same car as mine everywhere.  My 1995 Audi 90 Sport has more than fulfilled each of these.  I have yet to have any real problem after 32,000 miles.  Likewise, my previous Audi 80, from 15,000 miles when I purchased it to 82,000 miles when I sold it, cost me $7.50 in repairs!  That's right - $7.50!  This one is shaping up the same way.  Although it is not as much responsive as a BMW 3-series, it has excellent grip and it more useful during the winter.  As for exclusitivity, I've yet to see another 90 Sport.  It remains a great looking car, and due to its uniquness, no knows how old it really is.  The car is also very well designed and built.  If you have only owned American, or Japanese, you are missing out on real quality.  My greatest gripe is the same as my last Audi.  The service is VERY poor from my local dealership.  Audi USA has been no help.  Should this improve, Audi will begin to get even more of the attention it deserves.  I would highly recommend an Audi to anyone who loves to drive and truly appreciates a fine automobile!  If you want something to transfer you from A to B in pure serenity - with only minimal involvement - don't buy an Audi.  Or any German car.  Buy a Lexus and stay out of the left lane.<br><br>
