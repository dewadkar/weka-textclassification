            Christina's little purple Neon is a cute little car.  She bought this car in 1999 off the lot when they first came in.  It is a lavendar purple color Neon.  It is 2 door.  The car is  an automatic. It is a 4 cylendar.  She only had 2 kids when she had this car so it wasn't that bad with 2 kids.  Now she drives a Jeep Cherokee because she has 3 kids.  Her husband found out that he liked this car.  He now drives it.

It has bucket seats in the front and a bench seat in the back. The interior is gray. The gear shift is located in the center of the car between the front seats.  The windows are not automatic.  Neither are the door locks.  It has a tape player in it.  She just has a basic Neon, but she got a brand new car for under $13,000.  The car drives very well.  

It is a compact car.  It is very easy to drive.  The parking of this car is a breeze.  If you have a small space to get into, that is fine, this car is not very big.  It holds on to the road.  Around curves is great.  It is no problem to get where you want to go.

The gas mileage is very good.  It gets about 25 - 30 miles a gallon!! It is confortable seats.  The leg room is fairly good for the size of the car.  In the back is more cramped up, but the front is fine.

She has had one problem out of the car.  After about a year the paint started to peel!!!   It turns out it was the color.  She had to put it in the shop to have it repainted.  The warranty covered this.  It was because of the type of paint.  It turned out that quite a few of the lavendar purple color neons were peeling.  The shop repainted it the same color, but with a different type of paint.  The paint still looks good on the car now.  Other than this just regular oil changes is all she has had to do.

You can't really complain much about getting a brand new car really cheap. For what she paid for this car, she has gotten her moneys worth.  This would be  a great first car for a teenager.  It is cute and sporty looking.  But it only has a 4 cylendar, so you wouldn't have to worry about them racing.  She still likes driving the Neon when she doesn't have the kids.  It is easier in the Jeep Cherokee with three kids.

Leave me comments about what you think about my review!!

Thank you for reading and have a good day!!
