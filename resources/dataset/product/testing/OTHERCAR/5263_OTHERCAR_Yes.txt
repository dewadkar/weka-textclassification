            This summer, after replacing the 3rd transmission in my car, my husband and I decided to go car shopping.  One Sunday, we looked at the 3 dealerships in town and it was at the Chrysler/Plymouth dealership that we found our new car.  We knew we needed a 4 door, family car.  Our kids are 12 and 8 and above-average height.  We wanted good gas mileage as well.  We saw a Plymouth Breeze on the lot.  White, 4-door with a nice looking tan interior.  The price was right too, plus there was a $1000 cash back rebate going on at the time.

The next day my husband went back to the dealership and they were so wonderful with us.    We took the car for a test drive and since I am the primary driver, I got to do the driving.  The car accelerates smoothly, and gets up to 60 very quickly and effortlessly.  Since we are all tall, I sat in the back seat and was impressed at how roomy the back was.  No more kids kicking me in the back when I am driving!!  I was hooked, and knew I just had to have this car!

We had excellent customer service and the whole process of buying this car was painless!
