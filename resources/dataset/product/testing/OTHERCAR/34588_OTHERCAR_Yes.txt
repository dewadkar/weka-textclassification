            I purchased my 1996 Saturn SC1 as my first new car.  I'd had a couple used cars before the Saturn, so I had higher expectations for a NEW new car.

Overall, I'm very pleased.  It's got a few minor annoyances, like the huge trunk hinges and short sun visors.  It's also got it's fair share of odd squeaks and rattles- especially in the dash.  Considering the price, you have to expect a little lack of refinement.  Perhaps the newer models are better.

I've got +110,000 miles and the mileage is still around 36 MPG highway.  The only work I've had done was brakes at 90k, and a door adjustment to keep the rain out around 60k.  That's it- otherwise the car's been 100% reliable and problem free!
