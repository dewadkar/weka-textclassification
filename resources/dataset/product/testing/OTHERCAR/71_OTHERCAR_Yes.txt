            And you are looking for a luxury car?
Well, YOU FOUND IT! Mercedes E320!
Why? Well, its faster than a bmw323 and 528, and its
also a hell of alot nicer and safer than both lexus es and GS 300.
So, you need more convincing information. Mercedes are the best valued cars - 0-60 in around 7.5 seconds. the three pointed star has allowed sequential shifting also via a D+D- grid in the automatic transmission.
the new ground effects are show stopping, and the tires are meatier than the lexus tires, but not as great as the bmw. the bmw has cold styling, the benz is absolutely luxury. the xenon headlights are very cool.<br><br>
