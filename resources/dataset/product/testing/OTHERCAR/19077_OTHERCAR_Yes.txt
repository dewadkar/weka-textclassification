            I use this camera at work and at home and find that it is capable of taking some truly fabulous photographs.  

It is especially good at taking pictures of people, pets and other subject matter in controlled close range (less than 10 ft.) situations.

At work, I use the camera to take photos that we use on our website and quarterly newsletter.   We also used some of the photos in our annual report printed on glossy paper and they looked far better than the photos that we had taken with traditional cameras and scanned in.

Overall, I find the camera to be very easy to use and most amateurs who just want to break into the digital photography mode will love the camera. (In fact, I wouldn't start off with anything less than this)  

There are some significant drawbacks, however, that I think would preclude anybody really serious about photography to opt for a more expensive camera.  

The camera does not handle low light situations very well.  The flash is a bit on the slow side and pictures become quite grainy in low light.  

In addition, the detail levels start to drop of dramatically after about 15 feet in all lighting conditions.  This is especially noticable on pictures of people.  The pixelation on the face is pretty bad in long range photos (it reminded me of my old Kodak Disk Camera)  

The price is coming down rapidly on this model because the new versions are coming out this year, so as an introductory camera it is great.  But if your number 1 priority is high quality, you should probably opt for a 3 megapixel or higher camera.
