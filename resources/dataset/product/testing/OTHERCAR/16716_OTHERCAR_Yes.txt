            All in all I have owned 3 Peugeots: a  1986 205 GTI, a 1996 306 cabriolet and a 1994 405 Mi16 (bought in December 1997). One thing that bewilders me whenever I visit the USA is the obvious lack of support for French manufacturers - there are no Citroens, Renaults or Peugeots to be seen!
The 405 is a fine car - well equipped, spacious and refined it is all things to all people. The range of models offer petrol and diesel and saloon and estate configurations.
The Mi16 model that I owned was launched in 1990. It uses a 155bhp 2.0 litre 16 valve engine giving you a &quot;family car&quot; with sporting pretensions. Peugeot revised the 405 range in 1992 restyling the rear and upgrading the cabin completely.
As well as being renowned for the best diesel powerplants in the business, Peugeots are also synonymous with an excellent ride (without the use of hydraulic suspension, employed in some Citroen models) and good handling, and the 405 is no exception.
It can seat 5 adults in comfort, has a cavernous boot and is a well styled and classy looking car. Running costs are relatively modest and insurance too is respectable (the flagship Mi16 is a Group 15 in the UK).
I would recommend Peugeots to anyone. though they are extremely popular in England, as a &quot;Pug&quot; owner in the USA you would have the added novelty of owning something a little bit different....<br><br>
