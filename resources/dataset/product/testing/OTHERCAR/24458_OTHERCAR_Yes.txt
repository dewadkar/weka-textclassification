                   I've owned my CyberShot for several months now and use it quite often. My wife and I take several photographs, at weddings, graduations, reunions and other special occasions. We have three items we take with us on these expeditions, a CamCorder, an SLR camera, and our Sony CyberShot. 

       We love using our Sony because of the readiness of the photo and the quality. By being able to choose any of the resolutions we want, we are able to decide if the photo we took is worth blowing up. Our CyberShot has just as many options as our Minolta Maxxum 300 Si. Day, night, portrait, scenery, close and far. It can even get super close up shots of flower petals (within one and a half inches). The details are superb. 

       Our photo printer (Hp PhotoSmart P1000) takes flash cards, so the stick doesn't work with it, by itself, but you can buy an adapter card. The stick fits right in the adapter card and now we're able to use it with the printer. 

       Some camera's have a motion reducer built in but the CyberShot doesn't (~#@*%). To get around this though, just hold your elbows on your chest and take the picture (we have do this with our SLR also). We learned this from a Professional Photographer. 

       We're very happy with this purchase.
