            Like most GM products they look great but fall short on the fit and finish.  Its like the engineers and assemblers rather than miss Monday night football go home early--"It's Miller Time". This in some ways gives their vehicles character.  The Blazer looks great but the quality falls short when compared to the Pathfinder and Forerunner, but I say so what.  This is only something I pay closer attention to when buying a new vehicle.  This Blazer I bought used last year (9/2000).  I bought it from the original owner who babied the vehicle.  He changed the oil every 3,000 miles and the oil filters every other oil change.  This I thought to be weird, but the oil in the engine was very clean for 58,000 miles on the truck.  A year and 2 months later I have 61,000 miles on it. Yes I only put 3,000 miles on it in a little over a year.  When I first bought this truck I took it to the dealership to have it gone through for a 60k service.  The bill was $800 dollars.  This included a new muffler and brake work.  I considered the bill to be favorable for the amount of work done to it.  When it was in for service the dealer told me the rear was making a noise and that they needed to take it apart to see what was wrong with it.  They said the minimum cost would be $500-1500.  I told them I was not interested in "chasing noises" in this car because if I did that I would spend as much as it would cost to buy a new one.  I consider myself lucky on this truck as far as reliability.  It starts every time I get in it and runs smooth.  I "rolled the dice" on a GM product and got lucky.  For the money it was a bargain when you consider the truck retailed for close to 30k. and now you can buy a mint one for 12k.  Sounds good to me.
