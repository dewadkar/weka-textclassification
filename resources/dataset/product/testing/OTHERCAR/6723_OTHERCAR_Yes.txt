            I don't claim to be intelligent about how a vehicle runs, but I do know what I like. We bought our 1990 Honda Accord EX about 5 years ago. After driving (and hating) two Ford LTD lemons, I was more than ready for a nice comfy, reliable car. 

We are only the second owners of this little beauty, and we have never had any major problems yet. We have learned our lesson well about keeping the oil checked regularly in our vehicles, and so keep this baby well maintained.

I have never liked the &quot;big&quot; cars that my husband was always wanting to buy. When our friends asked us if we might want to buy their car because they wanted to get a newer model, we jumped to buy it. I am glad we did. Shortly after we purchased our Honda my father became seriously ill with Alzheimer's Disease. This meant that I had to drive to another city twice a month to help take care of him. That was a 3 hour drive one way.

My husband was glad that we had such a dependable car for me to take on those long trips. I had a cell phone, and a safe car to drive. I know a lot of women can fix cars, but I am not one of them. I did have one tire emergency, but you can't blame the car for that! I saved money driving the Honda over my husbands Nissan pickup too. His pickup was a 4 wheel drive and seemed to really guzzle gas.

I can sincerely say that this car made my trips very comfortable to take. I was able to travel safely and quickly to my destination with usually only one stop (at the beginning) for fuel. Then after I got home we could travel for days on what was left in the tank. I would buy another Honda Accord in a second. This one is 10 years old and still holding up fine, which is more than I can say about the other cars we have owned.
The features that I like:

1) Soft comfortable seats that recline and are adjustable for reaching the peddles easier. There is also an adjustable lumbar support in the drivers seat. So you can adjust it to fit your back. The fabric on the seats is nice and soft, and looks rich. Seat belts work fine, except the rear seat belts don't fit larger adults very well.

2) The steering wheel is adjustable too. Mine has a vinyl covering over the wheel, which helps you keep a good grip no matter how sweaty your hands get.

3) Great gas mileage. I get about 25 in town and 30 on the highway.

4) Large trunk for the size of car. We can get all the baggage a family of 4 can pack in it.

5) Cruise control. I don't use it as much as my husband, but he swears by it.

6) Air conditioning. This is the thing I like the most. I have chemical sensitivities and if the exhaust from a truck or bus is going to be coming in the vents, I switch over to inside venting and turn on the air conditioner. That takes care of almost every bit of pollution. Not saying this is going to work for everyone, but it sure helps me. Also when it is summery and hot, I can hardly live without it!

7) Sunroof. It is sometimes nice to use this feature. Your hair doesn't blow around like it does in a convertible!

8) It is a 5 speed. I love to have a car you have to shift gears in. It always makes me feel sporty!

9) Guts to make the hills! This little baby can make it up the hills, you just have to be in the right gear to start out. oh yeah, and make sure you aren't behind a slow-poke driver with an automatic.


I like the overall looks of the car too. I hated the looks of some of the newer versions, and was glad we bought this one. The only thing I don't like about it, is I have a hard time getting to drive it myself! My husband likes to drive it and so does my adult daughter.

I would recommend this car to anyone, man, woman, or your driving age children. Looking for a low maintenance car? Safe to drive? Save you money at the pump? This is the one!<br><br>
