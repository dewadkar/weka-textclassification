            I test drove a 2001 Sierra 2500HD Crew Cab with the new 6.6L Duramax Diesel engine.  This is absolutely an incredible machine.  The crew cab truck offers incredible space with lots of nice features that allow the driver and passengers not only comfort but also convenience.  The front seat was a 40/20/40 split bench seat.  This really felt like 2 bucket seats with available seat in the center.  Seat belts were very comfortable extending from the seat back.  Every control was readily accessible.  Radio volume raised and lowered as the road noise did same.  

Now for that new diesel engine.  I was truly impressed.  Engine noise was almost non-existent.  When the engine raced, it did not vibrate the truck as do most diesel engines.  The Allyson 5 speed transmission was smooth shifting with a really low gear as well as an overdrive that allows for great gas mileage.  Was told that the mileage should be around 20 mpg.  What a powerful feeling machine.  I have driven both the Ford Power Stroke and the Dodge Cummings.  This Duramax with an automatic transmission puts both of these trucks to shame.  The power, handling, and noise level makes it far superior to the competition.  The price is very similar to the others, although the dealer did not seem to want to negotiate on the sticker price.  

I feel this truck will be the truck that all who need a powerful diesel will want.  It is meant for those who need pulling power.  I may not be for those who just want a truck in the city.<br><br>
