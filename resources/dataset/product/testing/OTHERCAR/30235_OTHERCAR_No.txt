             Luckily, I didn't spend any money on this camera. However, I did receive it as a birthday present, and it's done nothing but disappoint me. When I first got it, the instructions and controls were hard to use, it took me a while to figure how to even look at the pictures. So I took some pictures, and headed to my computer. Plugged it into the back of my computer, and put in the new batteries it came with.

 It seems that for some reason, the camera does not have enough energy to upload the pictures on to your camera. This has happened with brand new, almost brand new, and old batteries. I expected it with the old batteries, but why wouldn't it work with BRAND NEW batteries?

 So I bought some Duracell Ultra's, and those seemed to work good for a while. But since it had to have so much energy, I needed to keep replacing them just to upload. The picture quality isn't all that great either. Unless it's almost perfect lighting and distance, te image is blurred and distorted.

 I wouldn't recommend for any of you to buy this, it's simply not worth the hassle. If you want a digital camera, I suggest you pay more for a good one.<br><br>
