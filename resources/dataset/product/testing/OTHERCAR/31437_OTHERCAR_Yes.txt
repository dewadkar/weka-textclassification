            This is camera is the followup to the popular Canon Powershot S45. Overall there is not much difference in the two. However, the new S50 is a 5 megapixel versus 4 megapixels in the previous model. Also US consumers will be treated to a solid sturdy black camera casing instead the standard silver that have been in most of Canon's cameras. (Silver will still be used for the international models). 

The Powershot S50 has a lot of features that most people are looking for when purchasing a digital camera. The 5 megapixels that this camera produces  comes out with some very sharp looking digital photos. The camera's primary color filters bring all that detail to  life, with true, vibrant color with a vast tonal range. Canon's unique image processor enhances image quality far beyond pixel count by increasing the speed. It also delivers precise autofocus accuracy . Canon's system is built in with a complex scene analysis called iSAPS Technology. All the technology on this camera definitely produces some nice prints.

This camera is also equipped with high resolution 3x zoom lense that can be powered digitally to 12x.  The S50 will also accept CompactFlash Type I and II cards. Manual focus users will appericate the full range adjustable aperture and manual priorities. You can also adjust white balance for different lighting conditions which is very nice. I also loved that this camera has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The S50 also comes with a separate plug in charger which was very convient. Menu's on the camera very easy to navigate also, the instructions that came with camera were also good. This camera also has a movie mode which allows you to record video for up to 3 minutes.

Overall I am very satisfied with this camera. It has basically everyone thing you need without all the extra frills in some of the more expensive cameras. The images that are produced from this camera are also top quality, you will definitely not be dissapointed. The price may be high but you are definitely paying for a quality camera that produces great pictures that you will always cherish.
