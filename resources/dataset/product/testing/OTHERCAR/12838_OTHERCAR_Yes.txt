            I traded in my Jeep Grand Cherokee for this vehicle in search of better gas mileage and greater reliability.  I was really not attracted at all to the old version of the RAV4 and was really pleasantly surprised to see the new edition of the RAV4 at the dealership.  Even though I thought it looked cool I said to myself that it could not be that roomy inside.....wrong!   I am 6'5" and I have more headroom in my RAV4 (no sunroof) than I had in my Jeep.  For taller drivers who use their SUV's for driving around town and who primarily only carry a small amount of passengers then this is the SUV for you.  Great gas mileage...in the mid 20's and the engine is smooth....don't plan on towing anything except a jet ski with this vehicle though.  The vehicle is extremely nimble, a breeze to park compared to the Jeep and seems to big in the areas that most people need their vehicle to be.  An example of this is that the rear seats can be completely removed making the cargo capacity of this vehicle equal many larger sized SUV's.  Toyota has priced this vehicle in-between the Corolla and the Camry....for the money, it's basically an economy SUV that has great driving feel and the high seating position that so many SUV drivers have come to love.  Resale values for the new version of the RAV4 (2001-present)appear to be very strong as the few used vehicles that I have seen for sale are only a few hundred dollars less than a brand new RAV4.  Toyota has a reputation for high resale values on SUV's too.
