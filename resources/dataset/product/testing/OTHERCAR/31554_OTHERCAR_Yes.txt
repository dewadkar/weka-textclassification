            I own this car/wagon, and I love it!  I found this gem used, but its a Volvo so it really doesn't matter how many miles is put on it.  200,000 miles is just breaking in a Volvo, especially the 240 DL series.  I've hardly had any trouble with this car, just a few things I've had to tinker with and none of the repair costs have been that expensive, nothign like a new car would cost.  

For those people who want a sound system and think that an old car can't handle it, well guess what, this bad boy wagon can!  I installed a pretty sweet system in my wagon and it hasn't malfunctioned yet and I've had it for almost a year now.  Cd player and all, its sweet!  

My wagon is a stick shift, but there are automatics, but who wants those anyhow?  Sticks are the way to go! The car is solid and when you sit and drive this bad momma you can really feel the solidity(heh heh) of this car.  I believe if I were to wreck with a newer car, I would just tear a whole in that car and come out without a scratch.  Yes, yes, parents if you want a car thats safe for your teen, I suggest you buy up this bad mama jamer!  

This card isn't a slow poke though, like I thought it would be.  OH NO!  This wagon, yes a wagon, excelled the speeds of 110mph!  How it did that I don't know, but my wagon can fly!  The best thing about it is, the cops never suspect a wagon can speed so you can easily fly bye the policmen and never get a ticket, trust me, I've done it loads of times.

If you want a car that's solid, safe, powerful, fast, and not that new techy looking get a 240 DL wagon!  Its the car of my dreams baby!
Parents should buy this wagon for their teens, specifically those teens who like the vintage look!
