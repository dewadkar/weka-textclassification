            This tin can was featured in the movie James Bond, which i think is a little small for him and everyone else. This is an outstanding car for performance. But as far as comfort and size go, i think it is a little to small for the open road. You dont see many males driving this car because they probably wouldnt fit. Also feels that it is a little close to the ground yet some people might like that but Most people like to be the king of the road. There are great engine choices on this model. Available is the 1.9 liter 138 hp  4-cylinder engine, and a 2.8 liter 189 hp, six cylinder engine. The M3 roadster is the same size but has a bigger engine. This is a cramped car so pack light. <br><br>
