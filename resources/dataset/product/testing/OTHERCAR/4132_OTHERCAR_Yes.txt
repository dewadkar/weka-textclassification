            I've always wanted an Acura Legend since I was 13 when my neighbors purchased one. I graduated from high school and purchased a '98 Accord V6EX coupe not knowing how attainable a used Legend would be. Nine months after purchasing the Accord, I went ahead and bought a '95 Legend LS coupe which I did not regret, despite the amount of money going towards two cars.

The exterior of the coupe is aggressive and its low slung stance adds to it even more. When driving, I was called out on several occasions by drivers asking what year my car was. When I told them it was a 1995 model, their jaws dropped. They assumed it was at least a 98 and one of them even thought it was new! 

The 1994/1995 model received minor revisions which included a new front/rear bumpers, new trunk, and the word "LEGEND" running across the trunk as opposed to the upper right corner. These minor touch ups really added to the cars appearance. 

When you open the door, you notice that the seat belt mechanism falls flat to the floor allowing easy access for rear seat passengers without getting stuck in the belt. As you close it, the belt mechanism raises up perpendicular to the floor. Also you notice you only have to close the door slightly, and the car "assists" you in pulling it snug, just like Mercedes. You then stick the key in the ignition and the telescopic steering wheel moves down and then towards you awaiting for you to take control. With a touch of a button, all settings are restored by memory, if someone other than you drove the vehicle.

The interior also contains climate control, BOSE sound system, heated power front seats, cruise control/audio controls on the steering wheel, (4).. yes FOUR power windows on the coupe, power moonroof, traction control and too many more to list.

Engine response is immediate with 230hp at your pleasure. All this power coming from a 3.2 liter Type II engine pulling a 3800lb car through the qtr mile @ 15.8 seconds!(automatic) All coupes from 93-95 were made with the type II engine, as well as the GS sedan in 94/95. This time was attained from my time slip when I took my car to the tracks, bone stock with 60K miles on the odometer.

Handling is equally impressive and the ride is smooth; the Legend combines sport and luxury perfectly.

As for fit and finish, the Legend was built as solid as a rock. I unfortunately was involved in a major accident with this vehicle at 50mph. I tried to avoid the accident by swerving left, and almost crashed into the left cement barrier so I turned the car right.. but a little too sharp. I then did two 360's on the freeway and crossed four lanes on the freeway and finally ended up in the right cement barrier. I actually drove away without a scratch. My legend only needed minor work on the rear bumper and rear fender, as well as a new rim and some new suspension components. After this accident, I was a firm believer in Acura.

I did sell this car in January of '01 to step into a '97 3.5RL. I do regret my decision but it was something I couldn't control. At the time of owning my Legend, I wanted to get my car into the import auto show in which I fixed the car up to the point where it was illegal. I had a court date and a long list of fines, in which the only way out was to sell the car(since my court date was only a week away). But as I stated in the title, the Acura Legend is definitely a car that has lived up to its name.
