            We had the 'pleasure' of driving a 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara as a rental car while our car was in the shop for repairs.  When we had the car there was approx. 12,500 miles on it. 

I thought the front seats were very roomy and comfortable the head rest was even high enough so that my 6'5&quot; husband could comfortably use it.  He also had enough leg space to drive comfortably, and the steering wheel adjusted high enough so he did not bump his legs when turning the wheel.

This vehicle was close enough to the ground to get in and out of, yet high enough to let you be up there to see the road and everything around you very well. 

I thought the ride was very smooth and quiet.  The few times we actually drove with the windows up we were very surprised at how quiet the car was.  I could barely hear anything. The Grand Vitara also rode very easily along the roads.  Not bumpy like some of the older mini SUV's like a Geo Tracker or Suzuki Sidekick.  I was impressed with that.

The model we drove came with a remote control key ring to lock and unlock the doors.  Simple to use, push the respectable button and the doors either lock or unlock.  Push both buttons and it sets off the panic alarm.  One thing I didn't like is that when you locked/unlocked the doors with the key ring the headlights flashed and the horn beeped once.  This is just a personal peeve of mine.  

I did have a small problem driving this vehicle.  I am 5'6&quot; tall, and I had problems using my main rearview mirror.  The back seats are just as tall as the front seats and that obstructed my view a bit, as well as the spare tire hanging on the back.  About 1/3 of the tire was in the window/mirror area and it made it hard to see.

I also felt the back seats were too small.  If my husband was driving the car, he would have to put the seat all the way back to get his legs to fit in there, that leaves close to no leg space for the passenger behind him.  When we had my son in his car seat back there the drivers seat was about 2-3 inches from his legs.  

The 'trunk space' is also VERY limited.  We put our stroller in there and a few of hubbies uniforms from the seamstress shop and that was about it for the room.  We have MUCH more room in our midsize sedan trunk.  The Grand Vitara did have a roof rack though, so for trips you could compensate with one of those cases that sit up there.

The model we drove was power windows and doorlocks.  Every passenger had a window button only the driver had the lock button.  The thing I didn't like was that the driver had control of the window lock, but it's either all or none.  So If we want the back window locked for the kidlet the front one needs to be locked as well.  I would like to see some control on the passenger side as well so the driver doesn't need to be bothered with this.

I felt that there wasn't a lot of pickup to this vehicle.  While waiting at a light it seemed to be VERY slow in getting to the desired speed.  I thought that the people behind me were going to have a fit cause I wasn't moving fast enough for them.  Again my sedan performs better in this department and I was surprised.  I really thought this vehicle would have some kick to it.

I felt a little shaky with the braking system as well.  I'm not sure if it's just something you had to get used to or what, but when you tap on the brakes, the car jerks to stop, they are very sensitive, but they don't feel safe to me.  It's hard to explain, but I wouldn't feel safe trying to stop on a rainy day. Like I said it might just be something you have to get used to.

I know it's just for safety measures, but the drivers side sun visor said right there &quot;this vehicle has a higher risk of rolling over&quot;. Just seeing that made me really scared to turn more than 5 miles per hour.

Depending on your needs, this might be a cute car for you.  It's sporty and has a smooth ride.  I personally wouldn't buy one, I can't put my finger quite on it, I just have a feeling that I shouldn't have this car even though this is the 'type' of car I am looking to purchase in the near future. I would rather put my dollars on a Toyota Rav4 or a Honda CRV.
