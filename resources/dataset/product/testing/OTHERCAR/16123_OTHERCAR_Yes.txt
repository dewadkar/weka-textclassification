            The 1999/2000 Grand Cherokee's is truly one of the finest SUV's on the road today. It's QuadaDrive Transmission puts it in a category that only Hummer can compete with today. And the new V8 is remarkably fast, and fuel efficient, turning in steady marks of 20 MPG on the highway. And the V8 is highly advisable over the V6, while the 6 is speedier than it's predecessor, it still lacks in performance when compared to it's speedy older brother the new 4.7L V8.

The Limited's new dual zone climate system keeps everyone happy, by allowing them to choose their own settings. The new overhead console has many more user-definable settings which used to require a trip to the dealer to change.

I would recommend switching the tires to something more aggressive, Jeep has shipped speed rated Goodyear Eagle LS tires with Grand Cherokees for the past 4-5 years, and they are not the proper tire. The Goodyear Wrangler RF/A or several tires from Michelin fit the vehicle's characteristics much better. 

It's a dream to drive, and everyone that I know wants mine! Visit http://www.jeep.com/ and drive away in one of your own.<br><br>
