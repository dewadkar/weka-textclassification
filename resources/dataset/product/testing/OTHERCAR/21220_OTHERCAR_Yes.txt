            I just made a 800 mile trip in a <B>2000 Toyota Camry LE-V6</B>. We decided to take this vehicle because it seemed to be a roomy alternative to my <i>1998 Mazda B2500 Truck ( see my review on a Darn Good Truck )</i>. It turned out to be a mixed bag of "tricks and treats". My friend purchased this <b>Camry</b> for $24,000.00 and has only put 9,000 miles on the vehicle. We decided to take this vehicle because it seats five ( there were three of us ) and gets decent gas mileage ( we achieved 23 mpg with highway driving at an average of 70 miles per hour ).

This trip was a X-mas trek to visit friends in two different towns in Texas. Each person had one small backpack and about three presents each. The first minor inconvenience was the size of the trunk. It was not as spacious as I would have thought. We ended up with a couple of pieces in the back seat. The back seat ended up being the most comfortable spot in the car. The rear seat passenger could sit sideways and stretch out their legs somewhat. The front drivers seating position is kind of cramped. There is plenty of fore and aft room, but headroom is very limited ( possibly hampered by the electric sunroof ). The room by your feet and knees was very tight and I developed a sore area on the side of my leg from being pressed up against the center console. The shorter of the drivers could not really use the center armrest because it does not move forward when you adjust the driver seat forward.

Some other shortcomings were a higher than expected level of road noise ( for a car at this price ), cruise control stalk was hard to locate, wiper blades made a horrible racket and the wiper controls did not have enough range of adjustments for changing conditions. This combination of things were enough to make the trip uncomfortable ( but tolerable ).

Some of the highlights of the <b>Camry</b> were the stellar stereo system with in dash 6 CD changer, more than adequate engine performance, excellent brakes, one of the best designed temperature control panels, perfect fit and finish of the wood and leather interior, dual dome lights ( great for person in the back to read maps without disturbing the driver ), and the best rearview mirror I've ever used. The rearview mirror casts a bluish-green tint and eliminates all glare from headlights. The power window and door controls were also a nice amenity.

The <b>Camry</b> has a great mechanical reputation and gave us seamless performance in a well handling package. The passenger front airbag is also a great design. It is like the Honda's in that it exits from the top of the dash ( therefore not directly at the passenger-this is a safer design ). The <b>Toyota Camry ( 1998-2001 )</b> rated excellent in crash tests for vehicles in its size category. It also rated high in the eyes of car thieves because of its popularity and premium on parts prices.

Like I stated in my title, the <b>Camry</b> presented me with a mixed bag. Great fit and finish with impressive performance. Excellent stereo and climate control panel with a rearview mirror that really made its presence known ( seems like a small thing but it was fantastic ). Cramped interior space and a smallish trunk ( 14 cubic feet ). Road noise was a little annoying at times for a $24,000.00 automobile.
