            The ephoto 780c is probably one of your best values in the megapixle camera market. Good quality pictures for average use (i.e. internet, etc.). I have made a lot of money with the ability to show a good picture on the auction services, thanks to this little gem. Easy to use, good ergonomic feel, and great software. Now for the bad points. Aside from the terrible battery life, the distracting green light in the viewfinder and the relatively large distance between viewfinder and lens, my camera had an unusual problem. The shutter release button lost it's &quot;click&quot;. Sounds odd, I know. But it is a very important feature of ANY camera to have a good mechanical support system for all of the function buttons, or you risk the possibility of premature feature activation (in this case, premature shutter release). I called Agfa support, and after an eternity on hold, the girl was very nice. She walked me through test procedures and determined that the camera did in fact work and that she could not help me, even though the camera is still in the warranty period (I bought the unit on 2/7/2000, it is now 11/22/2000). I asked for the service or parts department to see if I could resolve this matter myself. Her answer shocked me; &quot;We do not offer repair or parts services sir.&quot; What this means is if your camera breaks after the warranty period, throw it away and buy another one. Even if it is in the warranty period, if it develops a problem that does not directly affect the ability of the unit to take a picture (i.e. prevents picture from being taken or downloaded to the computer), you're out of luck. This is like saying if the spring on the trigger of your handgun is broken and you shoot yourself in the foot every time you take the piece out of the holster, there is nothing the manufacturer will do for you because after all, the gun does fire bullets. In all fairness though, Agfa did agree to replace my camera after a lot of complaining. But let's face it the camera WAS BROKEN. If Agfa can work out all of the bugs in this unit, they could have one of the most popular cameras on the market today. I love the unit, I just think company support could be better.<br><br>
