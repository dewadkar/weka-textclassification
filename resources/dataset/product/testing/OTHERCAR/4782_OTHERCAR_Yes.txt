            Within the field of automobile design, Audi is widely regarded as the leader.  It is not hard to see why.  While the A4 and the new TT get more attention, my personal favorite is the A6. While it looks a bit thick from some angles, especially over the rear wheel, the A6 has more distinctive styling than any other luxury sedan.  The runner up would be the Lexus GS, but the C-pillars and rear quarters that make the GS distinctive also make it unattractive to my eye.  The A6, in contrast, manages to be both distinctive and attractive.  (The Infiniti J30 was also both distinctive and attractive, if a touch too round, but its lack of space killed it.)

Drawn by the styling of the A6, I test drove one in the spring of 1998.  This is my recollection of that test drive.

[Note: I recently test drove the new 2.7T and 4.2 models of the A6.  See separate reviews in addition to this one if you are interested in these.]

Audis are not only attractive on the outside.  While their interiors are more conventionally styled, they are at least as attractive as the exteriors.  Everything flows together seamlessly.  The wood and leather have the look and feel of top quality materials.  No matter what your taste in interior decor, you should be able to find it here, since Audi offers a choice of three &quot;atmospheres.&quot;

The interior also abounds with nice touches.  While other German car companies have balked at &quot;American&quot; touches like cupholders, the A6 has some of the nicest in the business.  The ones in the rear seat are particularly clever--they pop out of the forward edge of the seat cushion.  In other luxury cars the cupholders in the rear seat fold out of a center armrest.  This makes them easy to upset.

The A6 is very roomy inside.  All outboard seating positions are very comfortable.  The cushions are firm, as in any German sedan, but supportive in the right places.  My only complaint about the seating is that the beltline (lower edge of the windows) of the A6 is fairly high.  This makes the car feel a touch closed in.  I personally prefer a lower beltline because of the airier feel and better visibility it imparts.

Unfortunately, driving the car is not nearly as exciting as looking at it.  The A6 Quattro is a heavy car, in part because of the AWD system.  200hp moves it adequately, but it isn't going to get the adrenaline pumping.  Especially not from a dead stop.  The Turbo and V8, available for 2000, should fix this problem.  I look forward to test driving them.  If you care at all about acceleration, I'd dig up the extra 5k or so for the Turbo.

I once owned an all-wheel-drive Toyota Celica.  The A6 Quattro reminded me of the pluses and minuses of such a set-up.  Traction in poor weather is unbeatable.  Having all four wheels transmitting power adds a measure of safety in all conditions, since getting on and off the power affects both ends of the car equally.  It is hard to upset the balance of such a chassis.  The downside is that the chassis is so balanced that tossing it around is not much fun.  It goes where you point it, but transmits little thrill in doing so.  Perhaps for similar reason, the steering also feels a bit dead.  In short, the downside is much the same as the upside.  You won't upset this chassis when you don't want to, nor when you want to.  My Toyota only became fun when there was snow on the ground or the road was unpaved and I could get the tail to step out a little.  The road up to Pike's Peak was a real trip in that car.  But most driving is not done on such roads.  The A6 is much the same way.

The ride was firm but composed, much like any other German luxury sedan. You'll feel many small road imperfections but the car will remain quite stable over the bigger ones.  Even at highway speeds the interior was quiet.  While not a Lexus LS400 in either area, the A6 works well as a luxury car.  Just don't expect it, to be a sports sedan, at least not in base form.

Sum:
Buy this car if you love the styling and/or desire AWD.  Don't, or at least get the Turbo, if you care about performance.<br><br>
