            Our first SUV/4WD. Fun to drive ... and park with the really short turning radius and short nose. A little narrower than some (at least feels that way) which has made the XL-7 an absolute joy to navigate the highways and byways of rural upstate New York. First snowfall was completely ignored as the 4WD and over-size tires just acted as if we were on dry road. A few kinks: Cibie does NOT support their product in the US, either directly or through the dealer - if you need a part (ours had a defective lamp socket) you have to buy a whole new lamp set (lens, brackets, harness, sockets, lamps and all!!) ... how very "French" I guess; the cruise controls are the most unusual I've ever seen (and not very user friendly either ... my wife won't even bother using it); the carpeting around the 3rd seat is not affixed and even the dealer tells me, after several "repairs", that it probably won't stay put; foot room is very cramped in the 2nd row seat and essentially non-existent in the 3rd row seats (fortunately we bought this vehicle with carting our three very young grand-children around in mind ... but I can see already we will be moving up to something else in a year or two as they graduate from car seats ... (and don't even try to get more than four adults in here). UPDATE 27DEC03: the cruise control on the 2003/2004 models looks just great (we went looking at them today). And the climate controls are even better (and we thought they were fine already!!).
