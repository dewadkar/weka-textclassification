My husband and I have considered purchasing a Jeep and after careful consideration found the following reasons not to purchase.

 1. Over priced for the quality of the product. 
 2. Previously leased and found consistent mechanical problems.
 3. Have friends who owned and every one has had transmission problems.
 4. Check with five insurance companies and found that they actually cost more to have full coverage than any other SUV.
 5. Designed to perform in snowy areas have a tendency to slide off the road due to weight, even four wheel drive has a better chance of 
 climbing out of a mud pit than getting out of a snow drift.

 If you have to go into debt for an SUV then go all the way and get a Mercedes you will not regret it. You will also find that five years later 
 you can still get 80 percent of your purchase price. Tell me what American made car carries that kind of trade or resale value? Wake you 
 and smell the coffee. 

 Do not go into a lease? This is a mistake from the beginning.
 Get a Mercedes not some poorly manufactured American made model which is primarily made from foreign parts anyway.
