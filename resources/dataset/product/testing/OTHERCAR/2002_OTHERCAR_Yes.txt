            Many reviewers have written about the 2000 Maxima's impressive HP (222) and performance, but that's only part the story. The car's handling was also improved for 2000...especially the SE with the 17&quot; tire an wheel package. For a car of it's size, it really can handle the road. Some may think the suspension is a bit stiff, I recommend a long test drive to be sure it meets your needs. The GLE suspension is an option...it's softer...without giving up too much handling and road feel.
Maxima's success over the years has been it's blend of performance and luxury... Nissan used to call it &quot;4DSC&quot; (four door sports car). The 2000 model doesn't disappoint. The transmission shifts much smoother than previous generations, it's quieter, the interior design is one of the best Nissan has ever done, and the build quality is top shelf. New for 2000 is a 100,000 mile tune-up interval on the engine.
I read at the Detroit Auto show last week, the the Maxima's engine was awarded as one of the &quot;World's 10 best engines&quot; for the 6th year in a row.
So the &quot;experts&quot; know what the rest of us have realized for a long time!
Maxima compares very well to the &quot;near luxury&quot; cars from Acura, Volvo. It's head and shoulders above Camry and Accord V6's. If you want a car with good looks, performance and luxury and pay under $30,000...Maxima should be #1 on your list.
