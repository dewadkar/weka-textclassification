            The Toshiba PDR-M4 digital camera is one of the best made cameras on the market.  I was in the process of buying a digital camera when I won the Toshiba PDR-M4 in a contest back in July.  When the camera arrived I was amazed at how simple it was to operate as I am a real &quot;klutz&quot; when it comes to electronic equipment. The pictures are sharp and clear and I couldn't have won a better product.  I have used it many times to put pictures of items up in auctions as well as send pictures of my new grandson to my many friends and relatives.  Anybody that thinks they can't take good pictures and put them on their computer must definitely look into buying this product. I checked into the price of this camera and the price is a good one - very affordable. So for those of you looking for a digital camera don't hesitate to check this one out.<br><br>
