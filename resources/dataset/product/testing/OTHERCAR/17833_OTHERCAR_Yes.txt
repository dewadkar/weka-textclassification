            I bought my 1986 XJ-6 sedan in 2000 as both a second car and a project car.  It is one of those things I have always wanted and finally got a chance to get for a mere $2800 cash.

The Jag has been a reliable daily driver even for it's age and mediocre state.  It made the trip from Northwest Florida to my home in Charleston without a single problem.  I drive it on a daily basis and it has never failed to start.  Except when I leave the lights on by accident because there is no warning chime to tell me that fact.  Jaguar built a very sturdy car that both rides and handles extremely well.  And by the looks of things, the original parts have worn very well since it rolled out of the factory in Coventry, England.  It still has 3 or the 4 original mufflers on it and only one has any rust of importance on it.

Over the course of the last 4 months have spent another $1200 in parts and repairs in my effort to restore the old boy to his former glory.  The biggest cost was for the installation of front upper and lower ball-joints.  The parts came in at a whopping $250 and the labor at darn near $450!  Ouch!  This was my first indication that repairs were not going to be cheap.  However, most of the do-it-yourself work has been relatively easy requiring no special tools and not more than a few hours on the weekend.

Overall, this has been a fun and reasonably affordable experience (although my wife would disagree at times).  :-)
