            All in all, I'd have to say that this car has done me well. Every time I need to get from point A to point B, I can always rely on my 1990 Buick Regal (limited, might I add) to get me to where I want to go. There have been only 2 times when the car didn't start for me. Once was when the alternator died, and the other was from a loose connection that I had fixed for free. The car has still a lot of power, and I can get it to 90 mph no problem. The transmission is great, and the sound system is superb. I had a CD player installed and it works great with the car. The interior and exterior are still in decent condition. The car only has one dent, and it's on the back. The car has great heat and AC which is good for the New England crazy whether (hot summers, very cold winters). The main things that got me po'd about the car is that it'd always do stuff that made you think there was something seriously wrong with it. The alternator sucks and has to be replaced, the breaks are never in the best condition...always shaking when slowing down on the highway, and how it has an oil leak. Sometimes after a rain, the car has less power and the engine shakes and it sucks shifting gears because it slams (not enough power to tranny). Must be a wire getting hit by water to make the car sputter. Other than that, it's all around a decent car.

WORK DONE TO MY 1990 BUICK REGAL

PAID: $2900

I PAID: $1400
MY DAD PAID: $1000
INSURANCE ACCIDENT MONEY: $500

2 NEW TIRES/HAZARD PLAN ($172)
ALIGNMENT ($70)
BALANCING ($40)
TUNE UP ($250)
SLICK 50 ($16)
TRANSMISSION SERVICE ($160)
BRAKES: ($315) (overall) BRAKES HAVE LIFETIME WARRANTEE at AUTOZONE
COIL: ($95)
NEW ALTERNATOR (TWICE, GOT FREE WITH WARRANTEE FROM USED CAR DEALER)

So as you see, I would have probably had to make more payments if I had a new car, so this car actually has more value to it.
