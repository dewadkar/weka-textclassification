            Well I got this when I was only 16, and i got my car in September of 99.  I got the LS, and every option available.  I just purrs...man is it fast!  The leather seats are awesome!  A 16 year old in a luxury car, how did this happen?  Well I got it for my birthday, but we looked at many cars.  My sticker price was 20,300...which was cheaper than the contour.  I also looked at Avengers, and Wranglers.  My dad wanted a practical car for me, well I got it!  Gas mileage is pretty good, even better now that I have a K & N.  I average about 280-320 miles a tank (15 gallon tank).  My advice is to pick up one up before its too late.  It drives smooth and quiet, and the handling is unbelievable.  I got into an accident in it several months after I got the vehicle, and the safety was impressive.  The car crumpled, but it absorbed all the impact, not me!  I am thankful for that!  Mercury made an unbelievable product for the money.  I got an excelant deal on mine, only disappointed with one thing.  The sound system is not premium!  don't waste your money.  I took care of that by replacing the ford cd player with an Alpine CDA 7864, replacing all factory speakers Infinty Kappas.  I also and two 12 inch JBL subs.  Not to mention a Crunch V4004C amp, and a Rockford Fosgate 160A2 and that baby is awesome!  My advice is to get the LS, cause the GS is ugly!  no options!  Plus, if you get a spoiler, the car looks fat!  Not to mention the alloy wheels!  Plus I haven't had any problems with the car!  I recently added a Cold Air Intake with a K & N filter and it really brings out the great sound in the Duratec.  These cars resell cheap, and parts are cheap as well.  There is a growing aftermarket for them as well, and tons of knowledge about them.  If you have a contour/mystique/cougar you should check out www.contour.org there forums contain tons of useful information on problems or modifications with the contour.
