            After reading many reviews, and test driving a couple of times, I was hooked.  Now that I have the 2002 SE with 6-speed manual, I am extremely impressed with this car.  This car is so smooth at high speeds, I am somewhat apprehensive about future driving violations.

Part of my impression of this car comes from the price.  When I looked at cars in the same price range, there was nothing that seemed to compare, many of which I had driven.  When looking at cars that do seem to compare well, such as the Beamer, the price was not as nice, nor is the expected reliability.  The new Maxima seemed the obvious choice.

I have the cloth interior and am quite happy with it.  I do like the exterior, but am not in love with it as much as I am with the car's performance.  It more than compensates.

I consider the handling very good, whereas the Beamer's is excellent.  The SE corners extremely well, though the turning radius is only OK.  Maybe it's not fair to compare the turning radius to my old Integra, which was outstanding, though quite a bit smaller.

My only problem was finding a car with the right options at the right price here in American Car Land...Detroit.  It seems few of the dealers have the 6-speed, and all of them want MSRP.  I finally found a good deal through the internet, but had to wait longer than I wanted.  Nissan has also created forced package deals that can irritate.  I really wanted the Meridian package, but after listening to the nearly $1100 Bose system that was also required (for no good reason), was not willing to pay for it to get the heated seats and side mirrors, which would have been nice here in Michigan.
