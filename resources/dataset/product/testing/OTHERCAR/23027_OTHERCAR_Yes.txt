            I got this camera as a Christmas present, and I must say it is one of the best gifts I have ever received. I use it for everything. It is not only easy to use, but it is also inexpensive. This camera has some great features, like LCD viewfinder which allows you to watch the pictures you are about to take or you can view the pictures and delete the ones you are not happy with. It also has 3 different lens settings, 4 resolution settings, and 4 flash settings. This camera also comes with some really great software. The PhotoMax Imaging software lets you upload your pictures, edit them and then you can save them or e-mail them. It also has a program called Photo Fantasy which lets you put your face on many different backgrounds, like the Statue of Liberty or a body builder! This is a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone!<br><br>
