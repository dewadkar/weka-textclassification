            I got my 1993 Saturn SL2 my sophmore year of college. It was one of the greatest things I ever did in my life. This has been by far the best car I have ever owned!

I have been in many accidents with my car and haven't received any dents. Actually, this past summer, I backed into my moms car because she parked it right behind mine. It was early in the morning and I was leaving for work so I didn't even think. Well I slammed right into her car! I was so mad, but I got out and looked and by the way she has a Saturn too! The only tihng I did to my car was bust off the side view mirror. I rubbed off all the smudges and scratches, and the same with my mom's car.

If you are looking for a near invincible car, go with a Saturn. They are very safe and very great for riding! Thank You Saturn! <br><br>
