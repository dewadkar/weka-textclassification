ABOUT THIS REVIEW

This is living product review of the entire experience.  It will not overload the reader with a vast array of statistics regarding height, weight, horsepower and other things you could find better done in a magazine or in the product manual. If you are a gearhead looking for a ton of motorhead-speak you can bail now. Everything from the decision to purchase a new vehicle through the selection of the make and dealer will be covered.  Periodic updates as they happen will be added.  Rarely does anyone know what they are getting into when they buy a car and rarely are there any followup reviews done after the showroom floor.   Problems, solutions, costs as well as positive things I find out as I own this thing. Look at the bottom for updates as they happen.  

Enjoy the ride

THE ADVENTURE BEGINS
BACKGROUND. 
After years of holding out I finally caved last year and decided to get a SUV.  The biggest single problem was the cost and the lack of anything in the middle.  The choices are generally between a  fully loaded  road hog or something resembling a station wagon.   I shopped for several months for a SUV that was not an overloaded Pig for 50,000 dollars (TOYOTA LAND CRUISER), or a stripped down station wagon (RAV4) for 15,000 dollars.   I wanted a car that I wouldn't cry if it got scratched and that my in-laws wouldnï¿½t mind going to dinner in.  Finally last year a middle sized market began to emerge. 

THE HUNT
 I narrowed the class down to the middle of the road which included Jeep Cherokee,  ISUZU Rodeo, and XTERRA.  I do not include the smaller Chevy Blazers or Ford Explorer class vehicles in this group because of  what I think is an extreme case of  overprice that accompanies them.    I honestly tried to look at Toyotas and Hondas but their sales force were so downright obnoxious and pushy that  I could stand a repeat trip to their dealerships.   I honestly liked  the dealership people at the ISUZU, JEEP, AND NISSAN dealerships enough to test drive three or four times.  

THE BAIT

The ISUZU had a 100,000 mile 10 year warrantee.

The Jeep was going out of business next year.  
The JEEP had a 4 liter engine that drove like a bat out of hell. 

The Xterra won many awards including best SUV the Xterra in 2001, its inaugural year.
The Xterra is built on a Frontier 4x4-truck  frame and drives like a caddy.
The NISSAN had  really cool luggage rack for my canoe. 


 All three were within 10 percent of each other in terms of headroom, legroom,  total vehicle weight, cargo space, wheel base, gas mileage, ground clearance  and price.  

DECISION

Nissan won because of three things.

1 The interior was very classy.
2 The side rails and luggage rack were very easy to get to.
3 Nissan stuff runs forever 

The ISUZU lost because it rode like a skateboard and the interior was really cheesy 

The JEEP lost out because half of the back cargo bay was taken up by the spare tire.  Come ON PEOPLE wise up. 

OPTIONS

For 1200 dollars it will behoove you to:

Buy the sport package 
Buy the power package
Buy the utility package
I did and I love them.   

I did not get the four wheel drive or the 16 inch tires.
I now wish I had sprung for them and you will too.

THE SALE
I used the internet  service at two dealerships and had them competing with each other.
It saved me a couple of thousand dollars.

Try this strategy to your advantage. 



PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 

December 01,2000
The CD player went out day three  
Outside of that it has driven like a dream.
The cab is a little hot but I live in Arizona.

December 15.
Got stuck in snow.
Wish I had gottenm the 4X4

January 10, 2001 
It gets about 19 miles per gallon.
Less than I expected.
Friend suggested I take the roof basket off to save mileage.
Gets about 20 now. 
Good move.

Jan 21, 2001
Got first oil change at 2500 miles
Dealer scolded me for returning too soon.
Sorry 4000 seems like too many miles

Feb 26 2001
Got second oil change. 5400 Miles
Had tires rotated front to back right front in spare.
Found out the spare is not an aluminum cast rim like the others.  
Had to pay for the wheel change.
HAD NOT COUNTED ON THAT.
CHECK THIS BEFORE YOU BUY

April 22 2001

Third oil change 8400 miles
Went to Jiffy Lube so the dealer wouldn't complain
Instead the Jiffy lube guy complained.
Needed air filter.


May 28, 2001
Fourth oil change  11,000 miles

June 1 2001
Rear end smacked by a 16 year old on cell phone runnung red light.
A MIRACLE OCCURS
The plastic cowl that serves as a bumper cover looks destroyed and it is.
Amazingly this part is less than 50.00.  the whole repair bill is 78 bucks.
On any other SUV this would appear to have been large (at least a couple hundred) dollars. 
the simple design appears to have saved me a great deal of change.


THIS IS ALL FOR NOW 
SEE YOU LATER
