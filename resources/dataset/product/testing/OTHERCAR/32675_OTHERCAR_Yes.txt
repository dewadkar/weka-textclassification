            With the transmission from my previous vehicle lying in the middle of the road, I needed a car fast! I compared the '99 Suzuki wagon, and the Saturn SW1, in the end purchasing the latter mostly because I liked the look of it and because the seats were more comfortable. The vehicle I bought was a '97 but had been a demonstrator, so had only 400 km and was like new. A pretty basic model, it has a standard transmission, power locks and factory alarm system.<br>On the plus side, it's extremely easy on gas - I'm getting close to 40 and 50 miles per gallon for city and highway driving respectively, and the tank is reasonably sized; I drive about 600 km (400 miles) per week and a weekly fillup is sometimes more than enough. The engine is nice and peppy, the transmission smooth and the vehicle easy to handle. Legroom is ample in the front, seats are pretty comfortable for a non-luxury vehicle, and the tilting steering wheel is a great thing to have. The factory-installed stereo gives reasonable sound. Overall, the car's performance has so far been extremely reliable.<br><br>However, there are a few problems. Although I understand that it's been improved a little in later years, the '97 is very noisy, especially at high speeds. The ventilation system is somewhat ineffective; in particular, it's hard to get the temperature I want without almost constantly readjusting the controls. Most annoying of all, though, is the design and organization of the signals and other controls as well as the &quot;comfort stuff&quot; like coffee holders. For example, the headlights and turn signals are located on the same apparatus. Often, when I use the signal the headlights go off - not the most reassuring thing at night - and when I cancel the turn signal it tends to flip over into the opposite &quot;on&quot; position rather than settling easily into the &quot;off&quot; position: a more minor but nevertheless irritating annoyance. When I asked about it, the dealer told me that a lot of people complain about it but it can't be adjusted and that I would &quot;just have to get used to it.&quot;  Other irritations: the dash rattles when the stereo is played at high volume, the exterior antenna comes loose and needs to be tightened every week or so, and the coffee-cup holder is situated such that lids tend to be knocked off when cups are placed in it, and when there is a cup in it it's hard to shift into 5th gear. <br><br>Finally, I've taken the vehicle only once to a Saturn dealer for maintenance; the service was quite unsatisfactory, taking hours longer than I was initially told and further requiring my return on a subsequent day because a seatbelt clip needed replacing (not Saturn's fault) and they didn't have the part in the shop.<br><br><br>
