            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best SUV there is.  That is if you consider an SUV to be a truck that rides well on the highway, kicks butt off road, carries around your stuff with ease and has nice styling.
There are trucks that do these individual things better.  For example, the Ford Explorer rides better on the pavement, the Wrangler is better off road and the Durango can haul more stuff.  But for a total package nothing can beat the Grand Cherokee.
To start off you have two engines to choose from.  I prefer the 4.7 L SOHC V8, but the 4.0 L Inline 6 is no slouch.  The four wheel drive systems are some of the best in the world.  You can choose from part time and full time systems.
The Jeep Grand Cherokee is very car like in its pavement performance.  It accelerates strongly, corners nimbly and rides smoothly.  Off-road the Grand Cherokee is a beast with very few peers.  In fact the only truck that can compare to the Grand Cherokees on and off road performance combo is the twice as expensive Range Rover from Land Rover.
This truck has beautiful styling and a fairly nice interior.  It is roomy and comfortable for long trips.  Gauges are well lit and there are a lot of cool gadgets.  However, be aware that Chrysler has had reliability problems with its electrical systems.

If you want an SUV that can do it all, but a Grand Cherokee now.  It is the best SUV ever built.<br><br>
