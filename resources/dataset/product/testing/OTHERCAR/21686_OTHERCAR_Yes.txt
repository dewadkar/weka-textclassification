            I purchased this vehicle for several reasons. First, it was in my price range. Second, it was rated well in Consumer Reports. Third, and most important, I heard good things about it from those who owned a Prizm. Fourth, and finally, I bought a Prizm because I loved the test drive. 
 I spent several months trying to find a car I could enjoy, rely on, and get a good deal on. I was very impressed to find that the Prizm was rated very well in Consumer Reports. 
 I am a college student, so I wanted something that was good on gas, needed little repairs, and lasted for several years to come. The Prizm has done all that. I actually have the 1998 model, but it is the same as the 1999. 
 I would definitely recommend this car to any college student, or even a small family. The interior has been comfortable enough to take me countless trips from Ohio to Florida and back. It's most roomy in the front, of course. The back seats are not as comfortable, but I never hear any complaints from my friends.
 I have always gotten compliments on my little Prizm, and it makes me proud to own one. I've put over 50,000 miles on my car in almost 3 years, and with proper maintanance, it's still getting me where I need to go in comfort and style! 
 If I had to list complaints about my car, I would have to say I wish it was more than a 4 speed. My next car will definitely have a V-6. I guess I just feel the need for speed! But for an economy car, it holds it's own.
 For REAL complaints: I have had to get a couple electrical problems fixed. They were minimal and covered under warranty though. The radio stopped working once, and had to be replaced. And also, my exterior lights blew a fuse which was easy to replace. Sometimes I have to click my electric locks twice to get the doors to lock, but that's not major to me. 
 Overall, I would rate the Prizm highly. If you are looking for a good economy car, definitely consider the Prizm.<br><br>
