            The notorious Jeep Wrangler.  For years I have wanted one.  I think it was from watching old reruns of MASH that I first fell in love with the Jeep.  They seemed FUN.  Go anywhere with the top down?  How could you beat that?

Well come this past September 1999, after getting a new job, I decided to go for it.  I went to the lot and wanted to buy something that instance.  I didn't want to order anything.  There were two in particular that caught my eye.  A Forest Green and a Canary Yellow...both had hardtops.  The only difference was the Forest Green had a better 4X4 package, lockable storage space, and a CD player and the Canary Yellow Jeep had air conditioning but didn't have any of the previously mentioned features of the Forest Green Jeep.

Well my wife and I stared and compared and went over it a bunch of different ways.  In the end, I went with the Forest Green.  The Canary Yellow was just too much to stare at over time.  It burned my retinas out.  I settled for practibility in the end and went with the Forest Green.  And I am very glad I did.

What do I love about this vehicle:  FUN FUN FUN.  I can't say this enough.  It just makes you feel cool.  Reaaly cool.  Get some customized plates and you will really have it going on.  Take the top down and feel the wind against your face.  Go up any of the toughest 4x4 trails and feel like a champion when you easily conquer it. Having the 5 speed Manual makes this vehicle even more fun.  
Attitude is a huge part of buying one of these.  Driving one of these does a lot to increase self esteem, and that's not a joke.  People notice you.  There is no cooler looking vehicle than a Jeep Wrangler with the top off.  Make sure to get the Tire package which includes to gas-charged shocks, bigger off road OWL tires, and chrome weels.  A must for any serious off road adventurer.  Besides the Tire package, other must have options are the cloth bucket seats, the center console package, the larger gas tank, and bigger battery.
What do I hate about this vehicle:  there isn't anything I hate about it.  There are a couple of small issues though. I got only the Hardtop with mine, and in the summer without air conditioning, you definitely want to take the top off.  I didn't have an official Jeep softop, so I bought a third party Safari top.  It only takes about 10 minutes to install the Safari top.  It definitely cuts back on the wind, but when it rains, it pours, and your Jeep still gets soaked.  Be prepared for that.  Next, if you are going to go on long trips, make sure you get Cruise Control.  I don't have it, and it can get old on your right knee when driving without cruise.  I'm definitely going to pay the $300 in parts and labor and get it installed soon.  If you live in the Midwest, you may want air conditioning.  It depends on how often you will have the top off I guess.  My philosophy is the hard top stays on from October to late April.  Then it comes off, and on goes the Safari top.  I live in Colorado, so there is little humidity, but for those that live in a humid area, you may want to consider A/C.  Expect 15 MPG in the city and maybe 17 MPG on the highway with the 6 cylinder 5 speed.


Driving this vehicle is great off road, good at normal highway speeds, and can get scarey at 80MPH and higher.  
It seriously can go anywhere.  That is no lie.  It handles great off road.  Spectacular.  There is no other vehicle on the market that will handle like this off road in this price range.  Maybe the Hummer will, but who wants to spend $80,000 on one and drive that thing through most narrow 4x4 trails.
At normal highway speeds up to 65MPH it handles well.  Not spectacular, but not horrible.  There will be noise.  That is to be expected.  It's not aerodynamic, and sometimes it feels like you are driving a huge square Borg ship into a hurricane, but it handles well unless you push it up to 80MPH or higher.  The faster I have ever gone was 92MPH and that was to keep up with the traffic here in Denver.  At that point, one may want to slow down, haha.  One recognizes the Wrangler wasn't meant to go that fast fairly rapidly.  The Jeep doesn't have a lot of acceleration when getting on the interstate, but it has lots of power when towing.  So yeah, people may pass you when you are trying to get going, but who cares?  You are driving a Jeep and are much cooler than they are :-)

If you are looking for adventure, want to feel cool, and want to go anywhere BUY THIS VEHICLE.  Don't look at any of the other similar sized SUVs on the market.  You will regret it.  This is the one to get.

If you have a family and need storage space, comfortability and a nice reliable, bounce free ride...steer clear.

This is definitely a SECOND vehicle to have if you have a family.  I also own a 1995 Buick Regal with leather seats and all the furnishings, and that is our long trip, comfort ride.  But the Jeep is what I drive when I want to go anywhere and have a lot of fun in doing so.

I highly recommend it.  <br><br>
