            Having three kids with discriminating opinions already, I know I can recommend this vehicle to other Moms and Dads.  We leased a Toyota 4Runner Limited in 1997.  We knew it was recommended by Consumer Reports, so we decided to go for it.  

First of all, I can fit THREE car seats in the row behind the driver.  This is no easy task!  Secondly, my kids love being up off the ground so they can see better. Third, the windows are tinted and so I don't have to mess with any shades on the side windows. Fourth, the back of the vehicle gives us all this room to haul strollers (we have three of them), soccer balls, toys, groceries, etc. Fifth, the seats fold down so easily that I can haul even larger items when the need arises. 

When we leased the 4Runner, I didn't want to be a mini-van mom quite yet, and I didn't want to drive a big Suburban.  This vehicle seemed to fit my needs.

The only bad thing I can say is that we did have some difficulty with the steering column and had it replaced at the beginning of our lease. This appeared to be a fluke, though.  Other than that, I loved the tight feel of the driver's seat and the fact that I felt very much in control when I drove the car. 

The 4Runner looks great and I feel like a very cool Mom when I drive it.  I think a mini-van would age me 10 years!
