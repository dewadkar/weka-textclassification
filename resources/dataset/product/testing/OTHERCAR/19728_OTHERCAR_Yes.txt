            1991 INFINITI G20
It's a good car for just about anyone. This is because it's affordable, even though it's a near-luxury sedan.  The one thing you need to know before purchasing this vehicle is that it is just a Nissan Sentra SE-R in a more expensive shell. The engine is exactly the same as Nissan's (it even says NISSAN on it). The inside is fairly different, but same parts are used.

Thus, when thinking about getting a G20 remember that you are getting a Nissan Sentra for a higher price. Now I am not saying that you shouldn't get this car, because it is a nice car, but buying this car you need to expect that you will have a high maintain cost, at least I do.

Mine is a light blue with about 113K miles. I have it for about three years. So far I have invested into it in repairs about $1500. To some this doesn't seem a lot, but to me it is, because I only paid $6800.  Now, problems that the car runs into are just problems that any car would run into: needs new rotors, new brakes..etc. The only repair that this car had, because of bad manufacture job is the engine mounts.  Those are three rubber pieces that hold your engine in a certain position and act as a suspension, so that the movement of the engine is not felt through the whole car.  I was told by the Infiniti dealership that this is a common problem with the 1991 model and the manufacturer modified the parts, so now they are heavy duty and should last much much longer. The job was around $390.<br><br>
