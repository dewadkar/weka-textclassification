            I would agree with all of the other positive things that other reviewers have mentioned in their own reviews: Value, power, nice seats, elegant styling, etc.

However, my main purpose in writing this review is to pinpoint every little quality flaw I have noticed (and not only in my particular CL) in my 2 years' ownership.

First of all, the plastic cover that you can slide open/closed underneath the sunroof: It shakes, and gives an irritating jiggly noise every time you go over anything that isn't smooth pavement.  Fortunately, Acura has a fix for it, and under warranty, they can take care of the problem in about 30 minutes.

The headrests.  The headrest in my passenger's seat doesn't quite fit perfectly - one of the "posts" that goes into the seats is slightly thinner than it should be.  The result?  Jiggly noises.  Though Acura couldn't fix it short of giving you a brand new headrest, it is very much possible to just stuff the hole with tissue paper until the "post" does indeed fit "perfectly".

Next, the windows.  This is where the cheap construction comes in...  Whenever you open the window (power, of course), the inner door panel pops out considerably (about 5-10mm?), and pops back into its original position when the window goes back to a complete close.  From a firm that claims itself to be a player among the automotive elites (though I personally find that hardly the case), this is pathetic.  Upon further observation, I find that this isn't so much a Honda thing, for I have seen numerous Japanese-built Hondas that don't have such a problem (Civics, Accords, you name it)... yet this is the case in every single American-built Honda/Acura I have seen - TL's, CL's, American Accords, and even the new (2003) American Accord and Accord Coupe.  Yet, when I step into a Japanese-built TSX... no such problem.  Based on these experiences, I'd really have to think twice about buying an American-built car again.... Praise the American unionized automotive worker.

Another thing about the inner door panel, it moves.  You can pull on the arm rest, and it'll come out a bit - not that it breaks or anything - but this'll never happen in a BMW, Merc, et al. - or even VW, for that matter.

The assembly of the car itself isn't necessarily accurate either.  Perhaps the bumper pieces were made several millimeters too big or too small or whatever, or perhaps it's simply due to good old American quality, the bumper's DON'T FIT perfectly.  Very close inspection will reveal that basically none of the pieces on the car fit perfectly, symetrically on both sides.  While the left side of the front bumper may fit perfectly, the right side may be off by a few millimeters.

Another thing about the power windows.  From the driver's seat, activating the passenger window yields a curiously loud clicking noise from the passenger window (i'm not talking about the button itself clicking)

From the inside, the roof of the car isn't necessarily solid, either.  It feels as if the headlining is done along a very thin sheet of metal, placed under the actual roof of the car.  Certain parts of the roof, from the inside of the car, will yield when you push up against it, making a popping sound.  - Another thing that would not be seen in a BMW.

That's it for my analysis of simply low quality associated with the car (I wouldn't call them flaws, for the car was probably executed as Honda would've wanted it).

Now to why it's not a BMW:

First of all, it doesn't drive anywhere near as nice.  Don't get me wrong, a CL is still a pretty entertaining drive, but just nothing to compare with, say, a 330Ci.  THe steering lacks feel, and it could certainly be heavier.  In addition to that, the car feels large and not too agile - it only required spending an hour thrashing an Acura 1.7EL (Civic rebadged as an Acura, for you Americans) before the feeling is all-too obvious.

Beyong the drive, the quality of materials in the car doesn't match up to the Europeans.  The plastics in the dashboard and on the inner door panels are still a ways from BMW and Audi.  And the center console (stereo, climate control, etc.) is just nasty grey hard plastic - not impressive.


In the end, all these flaws are really issues hardly worthy of being "problems".  However, perfectionists may find them irritating, and be bewildered at the idea that a supposed luxury car manufacturer would have such lax QC as to allow such flaws to survive through to production.  Alas, it was built in America.
