            Get past the love-it-or-hate-it styling and this is one phenomenal automobile.  Personally, I like it, just for the record.  This is not a car meant to be particularly beautiful in the traditional flowing organic shape way.  No, no.  This car is amazingly gorgeous in  that it makes no compromises to form.  Function is for all intents and purposes the main goal of the M Coupe.  Step inside and you'll understand.
For being as low as it is the M Coupe isn't terribly difficult to get into, even for my lanky 6'2&quot; frame.  Even if it's tougher for you for some reason, rest assured that it's worth the struggle.  This is not a car that you merely sit in.  This car instead wraps around you.  Instantly the wheel and gearshift will fall readily into hand.  The ergonomics are incredible.  You barely need to take your hands off the steering wheel to reach anything.  Visibility out of the massive windows is by far the best I have ever seen.  And oh yeah, don't forget about the engine.
The M coupe &quot;borrows&quot; the 3.2 straight six from the M3 and boy what an engine it is.  This engine is not just good.  It's creamy, saucy, delicious even.  And what a song it sings.  All the way up to it's magnificent redline it blares one of the most pleasing mechanical whirrings in all of autodom.  And the fact that it has 240 horsepower certainly doesn't hurt it any.  240 horses + 1 lightweight, structurally sound coupe = a 5.2 0-60 time.  And since this is a BMW &quot;M&quot; car it is no slouch when it comes to handling either.  Find a nice, twisty B-road and you won't be disappointed, not in the slightest sense of the word.
To sweeten the pot the M Coupe is even quite practical.  The odd, shoe-looking shape allows for a surprising amount of boot space--enough for at least a weekend's worth of luggage.  Gas mileage is more than acceptable, provided you don't mash the gas pedal every other light (easier said than done).  To top it all off maintenance is not an issue, as the car is built like a rock and serviced to the phenomenally high BMW standards.  And don't worry about the styling. <br><br>
