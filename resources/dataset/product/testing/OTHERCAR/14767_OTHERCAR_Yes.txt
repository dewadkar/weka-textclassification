            I bought a used 1997 Mercury Mountaineer for $17,500 in Jan 2000 off a car dealership who got it as a trade-in.  I bought it because I needed a car that I could travel in, and pack lots of gear and luggage into.  It had 30,000 miles on it and aside from that was in excellent condition.  It is a great all around vehicle.  The following are some key points:

        1.  It comes with all the luxury features:  Power everything, 
            leather interior, all-wheel drive, towing hitch, V-8 engine,
            controls for AC/audio front &amp; rear, 6 disc CD changer, rear 
            defrost, and a darkness sensor which keys your headlight on
            if so desired, and of course keyless entry &amp; alarm.
        2.  It gets good gas mileage, around 16-19 round town, and around 
            25+ on the open road.  
        3.  It's an SUV so you sit higher up and can view the entire road
            regardless of whether there is a car in-front of you or not.
            And it can off-road as well as a Jeep, if you really want to
            submit this luxury beast to that kind of abuse.  
                                                                                  4.  It is very spacious, seating 5 adults comfortably, and has 
            plenty of room in back to house a multitude of luggage, with a
            roof-rack to boot.
        5.  It drives quietly on the open road, around town due to stop &amp; 
            go you will hear the engine slightly.
        6.  It requires very little maintenance, and oil changes only 1-3
            times a year depending on how hard you use it.  I drive about
            40-45+ miles a day and only need to change the oil every 6 
            months.

This SUV has more than lived up to it's price and the standards as an all wheel drive vehicle.  It's a very sharp looking SUV, almost a mirror image of the Ford Explorer yet with all the luxuries you'd desire and a little more space.  And to top it off it's a very safe ride with airbags both sides and a tendency to not flip unlike the Jeep Wrangler and several
other SUVs.  Bottom line:  You're getting what you pay for if not more.
