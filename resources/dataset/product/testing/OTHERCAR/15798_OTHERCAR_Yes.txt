            I have owned over 55 cars and trucks. The 2000 T&amp;C is by far the nicest of the lot! While looking we found that the Chrysler line was just a bit nicer than the Dodge. And when all was said and done we rode away in the LXI version. 

  We liked the height of the seating(above ground level) as it is easier to get in and out of than either most other vans or cars! No climbing up or folding down to get in! The leather interior was chosen because we have two black Labs that ride with us. Have you ever tried to clean dog hair out of upholstery?  It wipes right off of leather. 

  The keyless entry that recognizes the key owner and adjusts the mirrors and seat positions is wonderful. However you still have to adjust the interior mirror. (maybe the next model will address this oversight)  

  The easy removal of the captains chairs amidships makes for a long space for cargo hauling. I had to move some furniture, and with the seats removed and with the two rear doors, loading was easy. 

  The multipurpose display on the overhead console gives a wide array of readouts. one of which is the clock. This is a drawback as it is generally not set to display the time and requires operator time and attention to change the display. A separate clock would be a big plus!

  The gas mileage is slightly better than we expected. We are averaging 18mpg overall and 24.4 mpg on the highway after the initial warm-up.

  On the negative side, two complaints so far, One for as expensive as this model is has too much road noise, The other is that for a short person, the window controls are too far for the driver to reach comfortably.
  
  This model is not for everyone. But if you need and desire the options available this is a wonderful vehicle.

   Knowing what we do now, about the T&amp;C, we would still buy one! we like it!<br><br>
