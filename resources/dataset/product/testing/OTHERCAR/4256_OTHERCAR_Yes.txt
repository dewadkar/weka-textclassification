            After trashing my old Honda Civic for 10 years, I decided
to get another hatchback to replace my old one.  I kinda
stumbled on the BMW 318ti by accident, after having looked
at Honda, Acura, VW golf, etc.  This is an amazing car.
It has plenty of power, the rear seats have good leg room,
the stereo/cd changer is awesome, and it's fun to drive.
Rear-wheel drive is great on the dry roads, probably not
a lot of fun in the snow.?

It amazes me how well BMW pays attention to the details,
the tiniest things show up even after two years of owning it,
like how the lights dim ~10 seconds after taking the key out,
or how you can roll the windows up after taking the key out
but before opening the door.  Good gas mileage, good service
at the place I got it (Allison BMW, Mountain View, CA).
This is a well-built car that will last a long time if you
take care of it.
