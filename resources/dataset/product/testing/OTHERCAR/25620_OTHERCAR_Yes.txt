            My car: SW2 new in 1998:
  5 speed manual transmission,
  ABS/Traction control
  Keyless entry/alarm
  Air Conditioning
  AM/FM Cassette
  Emerald Green Exterior
  Tan cloth Interior
  Price $17,000 out the door (including
   all taxes, fees)

The Good:
 Fuel Economy
  The economy of this car is incredible- I average 30 
  mpg... on about 70% hwy and 30% city driving.  On 
  roadtrips that are all freeway, I get up to 38 mpg. The
  127hp twin cam engine provides adequate power with the 
  manual transmission, it would be under-powered with an 
  automatic (but then this is true for all compact economy 
  cars.)

 Fun To Drive
  The car handles great-- nimble and responsive, quite fun 
  to drive.  

 It's A Wagon!!
  I love being able to haul stuff.  I got this car while in 
  grad school, a time when I moved to a different apartment 
  4 times in 3 years. This wagon came in real handy.  I
  even strapped a queen-sized mattress to the roof-rack.

 Saturn Service
  I've dealt with 4 dealers... 3 were exceptional and one 
  was above average.  Service is courteous and fast, free 
  shuttle rides, explain all the work they do.  

  At ~40,000 mile service, I had to have my "upper engine-
  mount bracket" replaced, but that was covered under 
  warranty.  

 Remote Keyless entry
  The keyfob is great, can lock and unlock doors and trunk
  with a press of the button.  I love this feature.  The
  red panic button is a little to easy to hit accidentally.
  I won't consider buying another car without this feature. 

The So-So
 Noise
  At higher speed, 60+ mph, the noise in the cabin gets 
  quite loud... engine noise and wind noise.  The door 
  seals and sound insulation definitely need improvement.
  My solution-- just crank up the radio louder =)  I'm
  thinking of replacing the radio and speakers to some 
  quality aftermarket setup... probably alpine.
  Also, the tape deck won't accept a cassette adapter for a
  portable CD player. The cassette deck just spits the
  adapter out.
  
 Interior Design
  The interior design and finish are not pretty. Strange 
  bulby center console.  Fit and finish are not great... by 
  this, I don't mean that things don't fit or are crooked, 
  but that the gaps are larger than other cars in this 
  class and the plastics look cheap.

The Bad
 Seats
  I am 6' tall and I'd like to be able to scoot the driver
  seat back about another 1/2 inch for drives longer than
  an hour.  The seats are not supportive enough.  The
  bottoms start to sag a little over time, and when I was
  having backaches, the seats would only make it worse.
  The seats are also very low-- even with the adjustable
  height cranked up.  My grandparents have trouble getting
  in and out of my car because of the low seats.

 Factory Tires
  The factory tires really suck.  I had to replace mine at 
  about 40,000 miles because I noticed I was hydro-planing 
  in the rain.  The new tires improved traction so much and 
  handle great in wet weather.  Others have complained 
  about the tires in the newsgroup: rec.autos.makers.saturn

Miscellaneous
  The optional center armrest is a must.  There are a few
  regular sellers on eBay with armrests for ~$70 (much
  cheaper than the dealer price of $180).  I also have a
  dealer installed roof rack.  It looks ok, and works ok,
  but other aftermarket racks are probably better.  The
  bike carrier that goes with the rack has to go on
  backwards so it doesn't get interfere with openning 
  the tailgate (a little annoying, but not the end of the
  world). I saw the saturn cycling team car once, and
  noticed they didn't use the dealer roof rack or bike
  carrier. I just had my windows tinted, and it looks
  really cool!
  
 ******UPDATE September 2001******
  The rear fold-down seat have started to squeek.
 
  Had to replace a "serpentine belt" due to "routine wear."

  At ~50,000 miles I had an "idler-pulley" replaced 
  because it was making a whining noise.  

  I've downgraded reliablity from 5 stars to 4 stars 
  because of these issues, but  I was never unable to drive 
  the car.

  I have discovered that Saturns are known for burning and 
  leaking motor oil.  I haven't experienced this yet, but I 
  am approaching the critical mileage for this.  I have my 
  fingers crossed that I can avoid this.
