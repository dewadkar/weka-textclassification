            I've had the turbo version of this car for about four years now and I love it. At 220? horsepower it's a rocket. You can fly from the beginning of the on-ramp to the highway before you know it and be passing people with plenty of peddle left at 80 mph. It won't beat a corvette of course but I'd much rather be in a metal box at 80mph than a fiberglass jug. Which brings me to my second point. 

Everyone hears how safe Volvo's are but I know for a fact. I've had two accidents in my Volvo and while neither involved another vehicle I think they were both somewhat serious. The first involved a piece of metal that fell of a truck on the highway bounced once of the road, once off my hood, and once of my windshield at about neck height on the drivers side. The windshield was of course smashed but the piece of metal, which was sizable by my estimates, didn't come thru the second layer of glass. 

The second accident involved a high speed collision with a spare tire that was lying on the highway. I don't remember much about the accident accept the last second when I realized that what I thought was a broken off truck retread was really a full sized Bronco type spare tire, and coming to on the side of the road with the distinct smell of airbag gases in the air. The under carriage of the car and the windshield suffered pretty bad damage but I was fine. As they say, cars can be replaced (and in this case fixed). People can't.

The third thing I like about this car is the comfort. The comfy heated (cold-weather option) leather front seats are great, the back seat area seems much more spacious to me than a similarly priced BMW at the time I was looking. The sound system is great too. 

The two cons to this care are directly related to one of the pros, the Turbo charged engine. Routine maintenance is expensive and suggested twice as often ( every 5000 miles ) as it is for the non-turbo version ( every 10,000 miles ). The car came with low-profile 17inch tires. These tend to wear quickly, one on my first set blew out at 30000 miles while the car was sitting in the driveway, and are expensive. I've also had to contend with a bent rim which I'm convinced probably wouldn't have occurred with regular tires. These too are expensive and Pennsylvania roads are not the best. 

All said I love this car, I wish it was less expensive to own, but I love it. Next time around I might skip the turbo and low profile tires
