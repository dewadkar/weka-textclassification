            OK first of all, the Camaro beats the Mustang in every category with prices normally lower than that of the Mustang. The beloved Camaro is being cut now, due to low sales, a real shame in my eyes. 

Now I am 17, this happens to be my first car. My parents said you could get a base Mustang, Camaro, or Honda or Acura. After test driving the Camaro, Mustang, Civic, Accord, 3.2 cl, and Integra, I'm happy to say i picked the right car.

First off, since i am 17 i was only able to procure the V6-which is fine. With the monsterous 3800 series V6 under the hood there is enough hp for even my tastes. Granted i would have loved the SS but hey, insurance = a lot in a sports car.

Now i guess i'll start with the engine. My father owns a 2000 Escalade so I'm used to the monsterous sounds coming from the vette engine...let me tell you, I was surprised by the sounds coming from the little version of the engine. The first time I pressed the gas, I was amazed. Even the V6 is a true sports car. At a bit over 200 hp you get alot of bang for your buck. Also, because it is rear wheel drive, there is plenty of access to the engine compartment for the sunday oil change.

Next is the tranny. I opted for the automatic since I live in an area where I will normally be driving on city streets and its not fun in stop-and-go trafic to have to keep shifting gears. Now i will admit, the 'bump' in the passenger side floor board is annoying if you like to keep your feet rather close to you or near the dash/console. 

Next would be the styling. I will admit the styling has'nt changed much since they went to the new style in the early 90's. I like the look of it over the Mustang because it looks sleeker and much more aggresive. I got the sports car red coloring. Because I live in florida I was afraid the paint would fade...so far thats not so. 

Now its the handeling/brakes. with the amount of hp generated at the rear wheels, the rear end constantly slides in first gear in the rain. But, thanks to the SRS (second gear start) thats no problem. I have all wheel anti-lock discs and they stop on a dime. The ride is very stiff, and thats what I like. If you dont like that then go get a sports sedan. The steering is very stiff, one small twitch of the wheel will send the tires spinning so you have to pay attention. Again, I like that, you dont have to. Also, the big 17 inch z28 wheels stick to the road like glue. cornering even at 50 is easy and fun, and the Camaro has no qualms about doing it.

I guess its time for the interior. Ok first off... IT'S A SPORTS CAR! Don't buy one thinking you'll get enough cargo and passenger room to fit the whole family and take them on a cross country vacation. It isn't happening. It can comfterably fit two adults (im 6'0") in the front with a small child or two in the rear buckets. The seats are a task to get in if your not used to them. Since the car is so low to the ground you flop in and climb out. But once your in the front buckets youll love them. I have the cloth interior, leather's nice but i live in south florida. The two front buckets hold the driver and passenger firm through everything. The dash is very driver oriented with easy to grab nobs and buttons. I have heard alot about the console mounted cup holder. I must say yes it is rather bothersome in the manual, but in the automatic its fine. Plus the passenger and both rear cup holders are in easy reach of the driver. I changed out the base sound system for an alpine cd reciever, i was dissapointed with the reciever, but the speakers are very nice at normal listening ranges. The dials are very nice and are in plain view of the driver with massive numbers for the massive hp generated in this colt killer. The visablity is another area you have to get used to. The hood is massive so it can be hard to judge distance in the begining, but after you drive it for a few days, you get used to it. Same with the rear visability. There are no rear windows so at times you can have trouble seeing whats going on. I invested in blind spot mirrors for my side mirrors, they help alot. Another thing, since this car sits so low to the ground ANY AND ALL cars bigger than this shine their lights thorough the rear hatch. Hey guess what, that's what the nightime switch on the rear view mirror is for. The rear cargo area is small when the rear seats are up, with the axle getting in the way. But, when they are folded down you get alot of room. Ive seen numbers in the 32 cubic feet.

All in all, the camaro is going to be missed by me and the rest of the Camaro lovers around the country. Although it has its quarks, it's pros outweigh the cons. We will miss you Camaro!
