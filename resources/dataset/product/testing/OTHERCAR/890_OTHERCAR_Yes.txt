            I've only had this camera for 2 weeks but I am stunned at the quality of the photos it takes compared to my Kodak DC240. I have not played with many of the settings or the manual overrides as yet but in auto mode it takes superb photos - just pull it out of the box, put the batteries in and start snapping. Low light performance is just so much better than lesser cameras. It has a remote control too. Why? Hmmmm... not sure, but it's nice all the same. I'd rather they had included something more useful such as rechargeable batteries and a recharger. Speaking of which...

You don't get any rechargeable batteries but since it can use AA's this is no big problem. You don't get a case either, and buying a small 3rd party case can be difficult because of the depth of the camera. It uses Smartmedia memory which I don't like because it's flimsy, slow, and more expensive than CompactFlash. The lens cap, a source of complaints with many cameras, is a pain because I keep forgetting to take it off before switching it on. It should also be tied to the body of the camera, so it's going to get lost sooner or later and probably sooner. This could have been easily rectified and is thus an unforgivable in my score sheet. Another niggle I have is that it can only output to NTSC or PAL depending on where you buy it. Other brands, such as Kodak, can output to both.

What you are buying here is a camera with little in the way of extras - but what a camera!
