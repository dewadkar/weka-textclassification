            After a long search for the right vehicle to purchase I had seen the new BMW 3 series driving down the street. For the new millenium BMW has remodeled the popular 3 series with sleeker lines and a sportier overall look. The car itself looks great both parked and while being driven.
However, there are a few things one should be aware of before purchasing this car. Firstly, the car is noisy. Apparently German car's are made with a special fan in the engine for cooling purposes. This fan is somewhat loud to those who are not used to German cars. Secondly, the windows tend to screach when being put either up or down. This tends to happen more during the warm months, and after a while you don't notice much. Lastly, they have been having some problems with the sunroof. After playing with it for a minute it will eventually open, but it dosen't always open when the button is pressed. I addressed both issues of my window noise and the sunroof to the dealership and they mentioned to me that BMW was aware of these problems, but has not figured out a resoultion yet.
Despite the few glitches in this car's manufacturing it is a pleasure to drive. A new oil system allows the car to be driven for 15,000 miles without an pil change.The trurning radius is exceptional and the tight stearing almost lends the car to be driven without a driver. Day trips are always a pleasure, and the back seat is roomier than the competitior Audi A4. The 328 gives the driver more power, but the 323 in my opinion is good enough. I would highly recomend this car to anyone who loves to drive.
