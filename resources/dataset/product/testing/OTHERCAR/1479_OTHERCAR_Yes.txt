            This car is bootleg! Why would Caddilaac want to make an SUV? Do they really think they can top the Grand Cherokee or Durango? This car has no power, it's mere luxury for 50 grand. The inside is roomy, but it has so many blind spots, handlings bad, and the overall performance is nothing compared to competitors. Caddilaac has to stop trying to come up with jive cars, and the have to start getting better marketing tips. The car guzzles gas, and it's a jagunda, almost the size of a navigator for that matter. Who would want to own this big hunk of junk? I regret ever buying it, the handling says all that the car really does blow. <br><br>
