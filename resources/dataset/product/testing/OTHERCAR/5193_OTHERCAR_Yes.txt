            The Honda Accord Coupe was totally re-designed starting with the 1998 model.   It challenges the stereotypes you have of the accord.   I had previously driven a 1982 Accord hatchback for 6 years thru high school and college.  It was one of those 'cars' - not much to look at, but it was dependable and got great mileage.  The new accord still has those same features, but man does it look better!   

I own a Black 2Dr Coupe EX - power windows, CD, power moonroof, etc.  The only option I didn't get was the leather seats - living in Minnesota you find that leather is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.  I love to drive my car - feel the torque when you press the gas.   The surprising thing I found when I test drove the cars - I compared the Civic, Accord Cp 4cyl, and Accord 6cyl was how much power the 4 cylinder engine really has.  The 6cyl is a little more expensive, but you get 200hp (a far cry from my 82 accord).   Even the 4cyl still has great acceleration.

The body is a great design - sleek, but not too sporty.  It is a great mid-size car that is surprisingly roomy inside - I can comfortably fit 5 in my car - they even put drink holders in the back seat!  I think this car is best suited for the 20-40yr crowd - professionals who want to drive a great looking car that is fun to drive, but still take the economics seriously - the price is great, and it still gets good gas mileage.    The only problem I have had so far is that the moonroof came out of the track, but the Honda dealership was great about it and had it fixed in an hour.
