    The BMW 528i is a well put together luxury sedan which combines practicality and fun.  If you're looking for a 4 door sedan that can carry 4 adults comfortably, and still handle VERY well, the 528i is a good choice.  With the performance package you get a beefed up suspension, along with 17&quot; rims and 235/45 Z rated tires to go with the stock 190+ horsepower engine.
    Not only is the 528 fun to drive, it's also very comfortable and well appointed.  The (optional) leather interior, seat heaters, and sunroof are very nice, and the fold down rear seats make it easy to carry skis, bikes, or anything else too large for the trunk alone.  The position memories for the seats and mirrors also make it possible for my wife and I to trade off driving the car without a lot of fussing with settings, since one button moves everything to the right place for each of us.
   The engine provides enough power for good performance and easy cruising at 80+, while still getting good mileage.  According to the car's computer, we've gotten 22.6 miles per gallon over the first 11,000 miles, and that's mostly city or short freeway trips.  Not great, but not bad either for this type of car. 
    If you want more performance and lower mileage, there are two upgraded versions from BMW.   The 540 is available now with a 280hp V8, and the M5 is coming soon with a 400hp V8.  In my opinion, either one of these is total overkill, and the 528 has plenty of performance combined with reasonable economy.
    This is a luxury sedan, so like its counterparts from other manufacturers it has most every bell or whistle you might need, including CD changer, automatic dual zone climate control, remote keyless entry, etc., etc., etc.  Frankly, if you're looking at $40,000 sedans, features are probably pretty much equal on all of them.  My only gripes are that the cup holders stink (BMW engineers don't seem to believe in them), and that the memory settings don't include vent louver directions (I like the vents aimed straight at me, my wife likes them aimed as far away from her as possible).
     In short, I would absolutely buy this car again.  But it is hard for me to say if its worth $15,000 or so more than a comparably equipped Camry or Accord.   Its a good car, but its definitely not aimed at the economy-minded buyer.  The one thing that makes it almost unique among 4 door sedans in the US is that BMW still sells it with a manual transmission.  Almost everyone else, including Acura, Infiniti, Lexus, Honda, Toyota, etc. only offer automatics.
