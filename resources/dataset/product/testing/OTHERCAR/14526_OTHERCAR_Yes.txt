            I bought my 1993 used Cadillac Eldorado in 1997. This car is the best car I have ever owned.I bought this vehicle for personal use. I feel much safer in this larger car than I did in my smaller, car. 

I love the way it handles on the road. It has a very powerful engine, 270 hp.There's nothing like the power you feel when driving this car. The seats are heated and very comfortable. The sound system is great. I love the custom wheels. It is a very sharp car. It has the northstar system and has just had it's first tune up at 100,000 miles.I love the many gadgets that this car has.

I did not like the cup holder. It was located in a place that was not convenient to me ( since I am short person )other than that one thing this car is a dream. I am spoiled now that I own a Cadillac Eldorado, and would never drive anything else.

This is a high maintenance car and should only be purchased by those who can afford to pay a higher price for regularly scheduled maintenance. If this car needs engine repairs or body work, expect to pay a larger than normal repair bill. This is a well built car and I have had little trouble with it. <br><br>
