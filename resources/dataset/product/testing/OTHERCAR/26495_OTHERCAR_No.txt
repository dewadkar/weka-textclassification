            We bought our 1997 4W S-10 LS in November of 96. Of course the truck was over-priced and we were over budgeted, but we really loved our truck.  We wanted a vehicle for camping and light four-wheel drive off road traveling.  We picked the S-10 because we liked the design and the third door option.  Within three months after we purchased the S-10, problems began to happen.

First the emergency brake got stuck.  We had to call our roadside service to get the brake released.  Unfortunately, the tow truck service had to break the cable that was connected to the brake in order to release it.  Ok no big deal right.  It was under warranty. At the same time we started to have problems with the third door on the extended cab.  The door release would stick.  So we took our truck into the Chevy dealer with both of these problems.  They replaced the cable for the emergency brake with no hassle, except the wait for the part.  As for the third door, the dealer gives us a hard time, saying there is nothing wrong with the release.  I think they said it was due to the weather.  Anyway, they just oiled it. In addition, one of the mechanics' left a pack of cigarettes in our car.  Of course we were steamed but we believed the mechanics were right and the problem was fixed. 

The problems with the third door continued and we were angry that we had to go through the inconvenience of taking our brand new truck into the dealer again.  We took the truck to a different Chevy dealer.  Surprisingly, this dealer was happy to replace it with no hassle for us under warranty.

We also started to have interior problems within the first six months.  The plastic on the doors and near the jump seat in the extended cab started to become brittle and crack.  We didn't want to bother with the dealer so we never fixed this problem.  During the second year, we had it pretty good.  We didn't have any serious problem except for one the bolt that broke off of the tailgate.  We took it into the dealer again and ordered the part.  It wasn't worth the warranty hassle and appointment so we ended up buying the part and replacing it ourselves. 

These seemed like minor problems and inconveniences, so we weren't too concerned.  That is why we have warranties, right?  By the spring of 1999, our truck was over two years old and my husband starting noticing problems with the fuel gauge.  We were getting close to the end of our warranty at 35,000 miles so we took the truck into the dealer again to have the fuel gauge checked.  We also had a regular maintenance and brake check.  We thought this would be a standard check.  It turns out our truck had a few problems.  Not only was the device that registers how much gas is in the fuel tank out, but the differential fluid was leaking.  They found a crack in the differential and said that this was due to &quot;excessive use&quot;.  What this is a four-wheel drive vehicle and we have never done any serious four-wheeling anyway? 

Our big problem came when they told us about the brakes.  The brake pads and one rotor had already gone.  This is normal wear but not at 35,000 mile.  We should have had at least 50,000 miles on those brakes, we thought anyway.  We did not expect to have to pay for this kind of maintenance so soon.

Through all of this, we really liked the S-10, but realized this was not a good off-road vehicle and wasn't the truck for us. Since we were expecting a new baby and our money situation changed we decided to sell the truck.  We had some good times in it but we realized that truck is better for going to the snow than going off road.  Since the truck was not under warranty anymore, we were afraid of future problems and the expense.  These vehicles are very expensive.  Before you purchase a vehicle like this you need to take this into consideration.  We recently purchased a restored 1969 Ford Bronco to replace the truck.

As far as towing goes, we towed a sixteen-foot travel trailer with our S-10.  The truck did fine and had no problems.<br><br>
