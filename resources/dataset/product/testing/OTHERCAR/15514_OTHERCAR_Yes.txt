            The original Z car was introduced over 30 years ago as a 240Z.  It was powered by a 150-horsepower 2.4-liter 6-cylinder engine.  Over the years following its introduction, the 240Z grew into the 260Z, then the 280Z, and finally the 300ZX.  It went from a small 2-passenger sports coupe that cost less than $3,500, to a high-luxury $45,000 sports car in the latter part of its existance.  In 1996, the 300ZX was dropped from the model lineup due to its ever increasing price and low sales.  In 1999, at the Detroit Auto Show, the first new Z Concept was shown to the public and received rave reviews.  A second-generation concept was introduced in 2001, and the production ready 350Z went on sale in the summer of 2002.  A convertible model is slated to go on sale in mid-to-late 2003 as a 2004 model.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The 350Z is a very stylish sports car.  Many aspects of its design recall that of the original 240Z.  The sleek-shaped hatchback body style has not changed in its 30 years of existance.  All models except for the Track and Performance model ride on 7-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels.  The Performace model rides on 6-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels.  The Track model upgrades the wheels to forged aluminum, but retains the same 18-inch wheels.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The V6 engine is very loud when pushed, but the exhaust sound is very befitting of a sports car.  The 350Z is very aerodynamic.  This allows it to cut through air resistance and also keeps wind noise down a great deal.  One neat feature I like most about the 350Z is the tilt steering wheel.  As you position the wheel up or down, the gauges move with it.  The cabin uses materials of Infinti-like quality.

Despite being a 2-seater, the 350Z has a LOT of interior space.  Although the 350Z looks low to the ground, once inside, there is plenty of head and legroom, even for tall drivers and passengers like me.  The bucket seats are very supportive and quite comfortable for long trips.  I do have a few minor gripes about the interior though.  Due to the curtain side airbags, Nissan was not able to put assist handles above the door.  Also, the cupholder that juts out of the dashboard looks pretty flimsy, and Nissan decided not to put a glovebox in the car either.  Other than that, the interior is first-rate!

All hatchbacks tend to be less structurally rigid than coupe or sedan counterparts.  That is why Nissan put a strut tower brace in the trunk.  To make it look more appearance-friendly, they put the Z insignia in the center of it.  Unfortunately, the brace does intrude on cargo space, giving it a claimed 6.8 cubic feet of cargo space.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The 350Z is powered by the same VQ-series 3.5-liter V6 found in the Altima, Maxima, and Infiniti's G35.  In the Z, its makes the most power.  To be exact, there is 287 horsepower at 6,200 rpm, and 274 lb./ft. of torque at 4,800 rpm.  Around town, the silky smooth V6 gives the 350Z enough low-end muscle to get out of its own way.  Most of the torque, however, is concentrated within the 3,000-5,000 rpm range.  On the highway, speed can build quickly, so keep an eye out on that speedometer.  The 350Z is available with two transmission options.  

All models come with a smooth-shifting, close-ratio, 6-speed manual transmission.  An electronically-controlled 5-speed automatic transmission is available only on Touring and Enthusiast models.  The automatic has the tendency to downshift a little late, but acceleration is much more smoother than that of the manual.  The 6-speed, however, is much more driveable, and my transmission of choice.

<b>HANDLING</b>: All models are very fun to drive, but the Track model with its stiffer suspension and low-profile high-performance tires add to the experience (AND the price for that matter!).  On the road, the Z can handle corners at relatively high rates of speed without even hint of tire scrubbing.  The car feels very planted especially on the highway.  Brake performance on all models is simply amazing.  The standard Brembo brake disc calipers on the Track model provide even better stopping power.

<b>RIDE</b>: On all models (except the Track), the ride is noticeably stiff, yet relative compliant on all but the worst potholes.  This is due to the Z's relatively long wheelbase (for a sports car) which stretches 104.3 inches, 0.2 inches shorter than a Corvette.  The Track model's tire/suspension setup is DEFINITELY not suited for the street.  Try before you buy!

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Nissan usually makes somewhat reliable cars, but the 350Z is too new a car to predict whether or not it is reliable.

<b>VALUE</b>: The 350Z is an excellent alternative to cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Acura NSX, and Porsche Boxster S.  All of these cars cost at least twice as much, but do not offer performance much different than that of the Z.  That was the original idea of the Z car when it was introduced, and that tradition continues to this day.
