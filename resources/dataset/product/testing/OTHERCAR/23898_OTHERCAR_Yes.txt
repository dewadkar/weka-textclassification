            I had the experience of a lifetime yesterday driving from Boston to Newport (and back) in a BRAND NEW Audi TT Roadster 225 with my friend Vickie (of epinions fame) yesterday.  Imagine two redheads driving around on a picture perfect day in a convertible and you can imagine what an awesome day we had!

Vickie just got the Audi TT on Tuesday of this week and after much anticipation has it out on the road.   Not only is it a thing of beauty, but it's a dream to drive.  And, we must have gotten stopped by easily 20 different people to ask us about the specs, the price, and a variety of other questions.  (And, girls, these guys who asked were pretty handsome).

So what are the specs?

Let's start with the engine.

This magnificent car has a turbocharged DOHC 225 hp inline 4-cylinder with direct ignition, two in-line charged intercoolers, electronic turbo boost regulation, 5-valves per cylinder.  As for horsepower, it's 225 @ 5900 rpm.  The car cost about $29 to fill up the tank and it is recommended that you use Premium unleaded for the best performance 

The Transmission - now this is cool.

Vickie's TT has a 6-speed manual transmission with synchronized reverse gear, and dual mass flywheel.  Call me a simpleton, but I thought I was pretty cool with the 5-speed transmission on my Jetta GLX.  This is a whole 'nother world.  Vickie is still getting used to the fact that 6th gear is where reverse is on her Audi A4, but by the ride home, everything was under control.

So how does this car perform?

It can go from 0 to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds.  If you are taking it racing, then the top track speed-225 hp: 143.  As I understand it, some of the original TT Roadsters in Germany were actually becoming &quot;airborne&quot; when they were driven at high speeds so they capped the high speed to 143 here in the States.  For those of us who have had a few speeding tickets in our day, 143 should be plenty.  

So how does it look?

You're probably looking for a little more detail than &quot;pretty freakin' cool&quot;, so here goes.  The Audi TT Roadster has two-sided full galvanized body with aluminum hood.  It comes in silver (Vickie's color), blue, black, green and of course, red.  The power outside mirrors have a defog feature and there are heated windshield washer nozzles!  The body is unusually contoured with a 3-way headlight assembly with ellipsoid low beam and fog lights.  There are fog lights:  2 in front and 1 in the rear.  It's a little bit wider than my friend was used to driving which made parallel parking on some of the narrow Newport side streets a bit of a challenge, but we got by without a scratch.
 
Naturally, you'd drive safely, but what if other's don't?

Well, there is an anti-lock brake system (ABS) with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) and electronic rear brake pressure regulation.  Both the driver and front passenger next generation front airbag supplemental restraints.  If you are getting into some race car driving, you can actually hit a button and turn off the passenger airbag, if you like.  There are, of course, front 3-point safety belts with automatic pre-tensioning, height adjustable upper mounts and force limiters.  And there is a central locking system with safety unlock feature (if airbag deploys).  To turn on the emergency warning triangle, you need to press a button in the rear cargo area.  And, the car even comes with a first aid kit.

So what is the inside like? 

I'll start with the sporty steering wheel which is a 3-spoke leather wrapped steering wheel with aluminum center trim ring.  Both the shift know and the hand brake are wrapped in black leather.  The steering column is manually adjustable.  Now here's a neat feature - the fully automatic climate control system has a sun sensor, dust and pollen filter.  (I liked this because we are in the middle of big time allergy season).  The power windows have with power retention which means that there is &quot;one touch up,&quot; &quot;one touch down&quot; and pinch protection.  This is great when you are going through tolls.

And there is more!  The electronic cruise control with coast, resume and shut-off features.  The electric rear window defogger with automatic timed shut-off feature.  (If you are like me and forget to turn it off, this is appreciated).  There is a power central locking system (doors, trunk and fuel door), with selective unlocking (enables unlocking of a single door or both doors), plus convenient open and close feature for windows.  The two seats have manual height adjustment and are covered in 
Valcona leather seat upholstery.  This same leather is on the door panel inserts.  There is aluminum trim on center dashboard vents, shift lever knob and base, knee bolsters on center console, door release handles, radio cover, glove box cover that really looks like something straight out of a James Bond movie.  There is a 50/50 split-fold rear seat (but I confess that I didn't pull it out to see what it looked like.  I would imagine it is very compact.  For you beverage drinkers - there are 2  aluminum cup holders in center console.  The trunk is really small, but what did you expect for something that should really be a second car?

Wheels/Tires

Vickie was concerned about the high performance Bridgestone tires given all of the controversy these days, but was assured that these are not the ones having the problems.  

The Instrument Panel

This has an illuminated backlit instrument cluster with automatic brightness control, including tachometer, electronic speedometer, voltmeter, digital clock with date, service interval indicator, fuel, coolant and oil temperature gauges.  In fact, you are told exaclty how many more miles you can drive before you run out of gas!

The Audi TT Roadster also has an anti-theft alarm system with blinking theft deterrent light and interior monitoring sensors (pulse radar interior monitoring sensors on Roadster for top down protection).  For those of you who like to talk on the phone while you drive, there is pre-wiring for Motorolaï¿½ hands-free cellular telephone.  

Oh, yes, the stereo!

Vickie went with the Audi stereo and it was a great choice.  I know because we blasted music all the way to Newport and back.  The stereo is an 80 watt concert AM/FM stereo cassette with Radio Broadcast Display System (RBDS), Graduated Audio Level Adjustment (GALA).  Vickie went ahead and had them pt in the 6-disc CD changer which was wonderful.  It sits right behind the driver's seat.  The radio antenna is in the rear window glass.  The speaker's are BOSE.  For a convertible, we got some great sound inside.

Geez - I have to mention that the car comes in around $41K.  We had people asking us if it cost twice that.  It also has a 4 years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first, no-charge scheduled maintenance, new vehicle limited warranty and a 12-year limited warranty against corrosion perforation.  You also get Audi 24-hour roadside assistance for 4 years.
