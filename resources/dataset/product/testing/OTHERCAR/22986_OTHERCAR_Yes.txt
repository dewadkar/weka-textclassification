            I've had this camera for about six months now, and have used it mostly to enhance my eBay auction listings.  However, the Polaroid PDC-640 is good for much more than that.  

I got this camera from uBid auctions for a reasonable $110.  It was a refurb, but came with all the standard accessories--case, strap, software, AC adaptor, four AA batteries, serial cable, and cable to connect to video source.  The camera came with a 90 day warranty, which I used about a week after the camera showed up.  The LCD freaked out and the camera wouldn't work anymore.  I called Polaroid's customer service department and they were pretty efficient.  I sent the camera to their service center.  In about a week and a half, I got a brand new one as replacement!  This is the one I've been using since then.

The PDC-640 comes with a removable 2MB Smartmedia card.  2MB will hold 12 high quality images, 24 medium quality, or 96 low quality photos.  You can use multiple Smartmedia cards or higher capacity ones, up to 8MB.  I use the 2MB card on medium resolution, so it's like having a roll of film, but since there is an LCD on the back, I can choose which pictures to keep and which to delete.  I also got an additional card with my replacement camera, and the two cards are plenty for my uses.  

Battery life on the camera is not spectacular.  The LCD screen uses a lot of battery power, so I use the AC adapter whenever possible.  I've tried a set of those new Engergizer e2 batteries and I think they last a bit longer, but in general, I'm near enough to an outlet to use the adapter.  

The software is the camera's weakest point.  My camera came with Polaroid's own PhotoMax 2.0 software, which is rather slow and quirky.  It arranges your pictures into &quot;albums,&quot; which aren't intuitive to organize.  For awhile, the software wasn't working correctly.  I finally figured out that a dialog box was popping up, but it was underneath the &quot;album&quot; box, and therefore unviewable.  I had to move stuff around until it finally worked.  Another thing that bothers me about the software is that it saves your photos with the extension &quot;.JPG&quot; (in capital letters).  This is really annoying if you use programs that are case sensitive, or you use your pictures for web pages.  

The image quality of the camera is quite good, especially in natural daylight.  The flash works well, but indoor photos aren't as nice as outdoor ones (pretty common for digital cameras I think).  I use this camera to take photos for auctions and also for the church web page.  I haven't made prints of any of them, so I don't know how it works for that, but for auctions and general photography for web pages, it's just fine.

One thing to note is that when I changed batteries, the LCD freaked out for awhile and I thought that the camera was broken, just like the first one I'd gotten.  After awhile though, it came back to normal.  

With digital camera prices rapidly falling, I'm no longer sure how good of a bargain the PDC-640 is.  At the time, though, it was the lowest-priced camera with an LCD.  I haven't been disappointed, but with the amount of use this camera gets, I might consider spending a couple more bucks for a megapixel camera or something else.  <br><br>
