            Just this past weekend, my three kids, hubby, and I got in the minivan and went searching for a SUV. Did not find many in our price range, so we headed back home. On the way home we stopped at the local <b>Dodge</b> dealer and I was in heaven. I found the <b>2001 Intrepid</b> and I was in awe.

Drove the car, made the deal and now I have a Silver <b>2001 Intrepid</b>. Why did we chose this vehicle? I loved the slick looking body type. It is a large sedan but very sporty. The car is just beautiful. My husband likes the V6 2.7 liter 200 horsepower engine. I, honestly can care less if it is fast or not ;-). 

So far the car is great. There are a few features I do however dislike. One, the ashtray is so low to the ground that is not easy to access. Second, the glove box handle is all the way to the left so the driver can open it;however, it makes it harder for the passenger to access. That is about it with the features I dislike.

The features I like about the car are it is all power. The buttons are easy to access. The car is super roomy. 2 car seats for my 23 month old and my three year old fit great and my oldest daughter who is 8 and a half has plenty of room. The passenger side is much roomier than my minivan ever was. 

The dashboard instruments are white during the day and green at night. Absolutely beautiful. I really like my car so far. 

The sticker price was $21700.00. Sounds high, but the car is rated one of the safest with its second generation air bags and great build. The car is composed of extra sturdy steel bars in the body. This makes the car much safer. 

As for insurance prices, my insurance varied slightly. Great deal for a great looking car. One last note, the car rides extremely smooth. There is no noticable noises.

I highly recommend this vehicle.
