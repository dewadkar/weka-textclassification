            Having owned a 1990 Coupe quattro 20V for over three years now I feel compelled to add my own experience with the Coupe quattros.  First of all, notice the small &quot;q&quot; in quattro... only the Original Quattro Turbo Coupes are designated with an uppercase Q.  Oh yes, and while we're mentioning the Quattro Turbo Coupes (also called UrQuattros by some), it should be noted that the Coupe quattro 20V and UrQ have VERY little in common.  I have to disagree with the original review of the Coupe quattro which stated that the newer Coupes have far less body roll than the older coupes.  The reverse is true in my experience.  The UrQuattro will run circles around a Coupe quattro BUT the UrQuattro does not offer the same level of reliability as the newer Coupe quattro.

Ok, my ownership experience began after selling a very reliable 4000 CS quattro to a good friend. I had long been impressed with the styling of the Coupe quattro and the 20V inline five added to the appeal at the time.  
If you are in search of an ultra reliable daily driver look further.  If you are in search of a fast sports coupe look further.  The Coupe quattro is not all that fast unless you spend some serious $$ and drop a 20 valve turbo five under the hood.  

The reliability of the car is not nearly as good as my old 4000 quattro.  During the last 3 years I have invested around eight thousand dollars in maint. and upgrades!  The previous owner of my car took care of it and was an Audi enthusiast so I thought it would be a good car...  guess again folks!  In this case, I'm thinking Audi stands for &quot;Actual Use Devours Income&quot;.  The really twisted thing about it is that I still love my Coupe quattro!  I guess I've gotten hooked on the rarity factor and all weather comfort.  

If you want a unique all weather Coupe, a Coupe quattro might be an option.  If you are more performance oriented and have another car to use as a daily driver, look for a classic UrQuattro.  

This is NOT a car for a poor college student... because of the rarity, many of the parts were made out of &quot;unobtainium&quot; and are dealer only parts.  Naturally, this results in the sale of body parts to maintain the car.  As crazy as it sounds, if the Coupe has you hooked you'll do it and not think about the cost of ownership.  There is something about the sound of the 20V five at 7k RPM that erases bad ownership experiences of the past.  ;-)

Grab the dice and take a gamble... the Coupe quattro is rewarding but sometimes costly.
