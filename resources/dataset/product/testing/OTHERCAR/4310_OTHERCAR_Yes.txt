            I bought my used 1994 Toyota Corolla DX in early 1996 when my 1986 Olds Cutlass Ciera kept stalling in intersections and I knew that just to keep my Oldsmobile going was going to cost quite a bit.  I wanted a vehicle that was dependable.  A co-worker had a 1981 Toyota Corolla she still drove everywhere and remarked how maintenance free the car was for her.  My Corolla purchase was made in a bit of a hurry, since I was risking my life daily driving the Olds.  And it was a very good purchase.

Why did I buy the 1994 Toyota Corolla?

It was primarily because of its proven dependable track record.  Since this was a used car, it came with some issues that the dealership didn't quite resolve as adequately as I wished.  The primary issue was with the brakes and their remedy was to put brake "mufflers" on them.  I had to replace the brakes a couple of years later and the new brakes are working very well.  (I make the initial mistake of going to Sears Automotive to fix my brakes.  They ground down the drum so unevenly and thin that I had to go elsewhere to get them done right.  But that is a whole different review!)

This is really, as a whole, a very maintenance-free car.  Above and beyond somewhat routine oil changes and getting the brakes fixed, in 1998 I had to replace the battery.  In 1999 we got new tires for the car.  I also had to take the car in for two recalls:  one for the safety belt and one for the airbag (the airbag could possibly deploy if liquid is spilled in the center console).

I think the safety belt mechanisms for the driver and front passenger are getting old because the belt won't automatically wind back when you get out of the car.  I find myself having to toss the loose part of the safety belt back onto the seat so I don't slam it in the car door.  A minor inconvenience.

This Corolla also came with a subtle/quiet whomp-whomp noise, which recently has gotten a bit louder and can be felt when driving (especially long distances).  We received a couple of conflicting estimates, but it either has to deal with the front bearings or tires and cost to fix is around $250 (for the front axle issue) or $350 to replace tires.  This is relatively a cheap fix for an 8 year old vehicle in my opinion.  Update:  We did get new Goodyear Viva Touring 80,000 mile tires (total was just under $300) on the car (the ones we bought in '99 were 30,000 mile cheap tires and we did a good job wearing them down) and the whomp-whomp sound is virtually gone!  Yea! 

Body-wise, this Toyota has held up to a lot of elements, including dust storms, hail (last week we had quarter sized hail but our car shows no signs of damage), rock sand on snowy roads, ice frozen on (I've had to chisel my way to get in the car several times), and blazing sun.  There's some pitting on the front of the car, but otherwise the body looks great for its age.  I haven't even waxed it in about 2 years and the paint still holds its beauty.

We didn't buy this car for the roomy luxury I was accustomed to with my Oldsmobile, that's for sure.  My husband, who is 6'2", drives the Corolla, his right leg is usually pressing against the automatic shift on the floor, or on the cup holder if it is open (and he adjusts the seat as far back as it will go). When my brother-in-law (6'5")would join us on car trips, he took up most of the back seat because there really wasn't any leg room for him.  

For me (I'm 5'4"), the car is about the right size.  The trunk is about as roomy as the one I had in the Oldsmobile.  All the controls are easy for me to view and reach.  The DX has power locks and power windows that I was used to from my Oldsmobile, but it did not have the power seat adjuster (but I didn't really miss it).  The center console has ample room for me to stash my sunglasses, tapes, and loose change.  My hands wrap around the steering wheel and feel comfortable with the grip (the girth of this steering wheel is thicker than on my Oldsmobile).

This car is used to the stop-and-go traffic you'd find in a big city.  I found this car maneuvered very well in this situation and it was relatively easy for me to fit the car in small parking spots.

We also took some very long road trips with the Corolla, and the gas mileage was relatively very good (between 30 and 35, sometimes up to 45 miles per gallon).  However, the lumbar support seemed to sag after a while (we would use empty plastic pop bottles to help with back support).  This is not a luxury car, though.

As far as handling goes, this car seems to grip the road well, even when taking fast curves.  This does ride pretty low to the ground which makes the center of gravity for this car much lower than luxury cars and SUVs.  This is not a touring car and it does not have a quiet ride (although it is quieter than compact cars like the GEO Metro).

I did not buy this car for luxury, but because I wanted a dependable, and relatively maintenance-free car.  And that is exactly what I got.  I am pretty sure I can get at least another 5 years out of this car (it now has 110,000 miles on it), before I have to upgrade to the family bus.
