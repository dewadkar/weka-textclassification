            The 2000 Acura TL compares favorably to other luxury nameplates such as the BMW 3 series, the Audi A6 and the Mercedes C yet sports a sticker price 25% less.

These are the features you are sure to appreciate in the Acura TL:

- <b>Engine</b>:  The quiet, 3.2 liter V6 is very smooth and has incredible pick-up.
- <b>Comfort</b>:  The plush leather seats are extremely comfortable both in the front and the back.
- <b>Interior Styling</b>:  The wood grain touches give the interior a classy, luxury feel.
- <b>Reliability</b>:  As with all Acura/Honda products, I have been very impressed with the quality and reliability of this vehicle.
- <b>Appearance</b>:  Contrary to other opinions, I think the exterior styling is sleek and attractive.

I do have some minor gripes about the Acura TL that may interest you:

- <b>Radio</b>:  The quality of the sound is outstanding when playing a CD, but when listening to the radio, the Bose receiver picks up any hint of static (in Los Angeles, this is occurs quiet frequently).
- <b>Center Console</b>:  The center console makes an annoying click that the dealer says is prevalent in most of the TLs.
- <b>Rear Leg Room</b>:  Leg room in the rear is not great.

With many Acura TLs set to come off lease in the coming months (2002), there are sure to be some solid values available in the marketplace.  I suspect that the pricing of these vehicles will again compare favorably to the other nameplates I mentioned.  I recommend the Acura TL highly.
