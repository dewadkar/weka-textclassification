              We recently purchased a 2000 model Odyssey and first impressions have been VERY positive. The power sliding doors are easy to operate for our 5 year old and her mother. Having doors on both sides makes it very easy to load both kids and the middle row captains seats hold our baby seat very securely and snuggly. It has an abundance of smooth quiet power and the fuel mileage has averaged around 17. The ride is smooth and controlled,it feels like a sports car compared to other mini-vans I have driven. The fold down rear seat is easy to operate and creates considerable room. It even has enough cup holders that no one goes thirsty on longer road trips. Ours had one minor problem with the intermittent wipers that our dealership repaired quickly and happily. I just wish that Honda could make room for a full size spare. Overall 2 thumbs up! <br><br>
