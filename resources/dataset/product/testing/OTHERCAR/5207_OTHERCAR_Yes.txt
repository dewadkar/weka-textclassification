            <b>We bought the Fuji DX-10 Digital camera this past Christmas as a &quot;beginner&quot; type Digital Camera. I spend a lot of time creating web pages for other people, and occasionally put items up for auction on Ebay. Rather than taking pictures with a 35 mm camera, getting the filmed developed &amp; then scanning the pictures - with a Digital Camera - you simply take the picture, upload it to your computer and you're done!</b>

We chose the Fuji DX-10 for several reasons including - low price, high quality - high resolution images, 1.8&quot; liquid crystal display, size (weighs less than a pound) and much much more.

The Fuji Dx-10 features an 850,0000-pixel primary color LCD; extensive focusing range; easy to use wide-angle lens (which is equivalent to a 40mm lens on a 35 mm camera); auto-flash, 1.6X Digital Telephoto Function, and red eye reduction.

The Fuji DX-10 comes with a 2MB SmartMedia. With the camera in &quot;normal&quot; mode - 13 pictures can be taken before you will need to upload the pictures to a PC; with the camera in &quot;fine&quot; mode - 6 pictures can be recorded before you will need to upload the pictures to a PC.  This digital camera also came with 4 AA alkaline batteries, hand strap, Fujifilm Software, Adobe Photo Deluxe software, and an interface cable that goes from the camera to your PC.

Upon opening the package up, we were able to simply put the batteries in the battery compartment, insert the SmartMedia card, turn the camera on &amp; begin taking pictures. We did have to sit down and read the manual carefully though, as this was our first time using a digital camera and we were not sure exactly what this camera could do.

<b>The Things I Like About The Fuji DX-10 Digital Camera: 
* LCD Display with playback mode
* Excellent picture quality
* Self-timer mode (allows you to use a 10 second timer)
* Red eye reduction
* Ability to quickly upload images to a computer 
* Compact design
* Attractive look

The Things I Do Not Like About The Fuji DX-10 Digital Camera:
* Battery life is short - especially when using the LCD display
* 2MB Smart Media Card included does not hold enough pictures - would be nice if a larger media card were included
* When not using the flash, the pictures can appear somewhat blurry</b>

I recommend the Fuji DX-10 Digital Camera to anyone in the market for a beginner Digital Camera. I also recommend purchasing an AC-5V AC Power Adapter with this camera as the batteries run out fairly quickly. I also suggest purchasing rechargeable batteries &amp; a battery recharger as these type of batteries seems to last longer than Alkaline Batteries.

The Fuji DX-10 Digital Camera would make a great gift for a high school graduate, birthday, anniversary, wedding or other special holiday. Inexpensive in price, and attractive in design, this camera does a wonderful job in taking sharp, clear, digital pictures each and every time<br><br>
