            My wife and I bought a new 1998 Chrysler Concorde in July of 1998. We have owned the car for a year and a half now and it has been to the shop no less than 5 times for overnight repairs.

We bought the car because it was a great size for our growing family. It is bigger than the imports, comes standard with a V6, and very competitively priced. I knew it was the first model of a new design, but we took our chances. It was a big mistake.

The driver's side window screeched unbearably, so they greased the track which helped for approximately one day. It started screeching again, then broke completely. We took it in. They put in a new motor so that we could once again enjoy the screeching noise. Fortunately, that was soon drowned out by the screeching of the bearings in the tensioning pulley on the engine. It had broken a whole 8,000 into the life of the vehicle. We took it in.

They fixed that and things went okay for a while, then the embarrassingly loud driver's window, which the dealership said was just a track problem broke again. We took it in. They fixed it and told me my tires were wearing poorly - which was true. The air pressure was okay, so I paid to have my 15,000 mile car aligned.

Then in August - 13 months into owning it - the air conditioner broke. 95 degrees with no air and my baby in the car. We took it in. NC lemon law rules say 4 major repairs in 12 months - so we just missed it. Darn.

After that the car performed admirably, except for the fact that my tires continued to wear poorly so I had it aligned again in October. Each alignment was about $100.

Finally, in January, it failed to start in our garage and made terrible noises when the key was turned. So we had it towed in and will not be driving it home again. We are VERY disappointed in the vehicle. All the nice things I could have said about it like economy, room, and comfort fly out the window when it is so unreliable. Stay away from this one - we will from now on.<br><br>
