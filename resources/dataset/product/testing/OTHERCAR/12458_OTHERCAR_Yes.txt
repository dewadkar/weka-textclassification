            I bought my S40 in March 2000.  I am still in love with it.  I am never bored with it and I love driving it more and more.  It zips up canyons, does well in the snow (the winter driving option is a must), looks beautiful and sporty, and receives many glances and stares at stop lights! 
I started my search back in January and had it narrowed down to the S40 and VW Passat (this only lasted a minute).  After looking at the Passat and its minimal options and outrageous prices for a base model, lack-of-appeal interior, my heart was completely set on the S40.  

I have the blackberry color and love it, especially in the sunshine.  I love the power it has for an automatic, the performance and steering is great, and the overall interior is satisfying.  I enjoy all of the safety features, but wish that the upgraded stereo was a bit more impressive.  It is nice to see a car out there with a little more style and substance.  

I am very pleased to have this car, have not had one mechanical problem with it yet and love that there are not a million of them on the road.  It's nice to be a little different and unique in a sea of Honda Accords, VW Jettas, Passats, and Toyotas!  

I am a new member to the Volvo family and feel that future car purchases will be Volvos!  I'm hooked and am pleased with my purchase --- making it the best thing I have done as far as buying cars.<br><br>
