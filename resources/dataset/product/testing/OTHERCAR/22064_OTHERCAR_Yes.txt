            I bought the camera because of it's size, weight and the quality reputation of Kodak. The photos and functions are great. The camera has a high quality feel to it, not like the plastic ones offered by the other manufacturers. Long download time and Short battery life are areas which could use improvement. Over all, for the money it's an excellent buy. Great for the first time digital camera user. I recommend getting a 32 Meg Flash card if you will be shooting High Quality Photos. The 4 meg Flash card supplied with the camera is used up quick. If you intend on downloading your pictures to a computer invest in a large hard drive, 10 Gig or better. I rate this camera &quot;A&quot; for ease of use and quality. <br><br>
