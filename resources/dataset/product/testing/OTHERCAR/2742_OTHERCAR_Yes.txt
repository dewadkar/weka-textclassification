            We bought our S-10 new in 1994 after doing a little research.  I had always wanted a pick-up and since we had a small family this was an appropriate size for us.  Another factor in our buying decision was a GREAT deal - we bought the truck new for six thousand dollars.  Originally, it was $8500.00(sale priced), but we had a trade in too.

Our truck came with air conditioner only.  We bought the stereo system from an electronics store and my husband installed it himself.  This is one reason the price was so low.  

The truck is a four cylinder, which means it doesn't have a lot of power, but it is also economical on gas.  The truck was originally bought for me to drive to and from work and to just get around in.  After we extended our family, it was passed on to my husband.

I did not like driving the truck in the rain because it would slide right off the road if I ran into a puddle.  It also got stuck in the mud several times and did not have enough power to get itself out.  We had to call a tow truck to pull the truck out.  We did not drive the truck into overly muddy areas, one of these places was a grassy  soccer field!

My husband uses this truck for a work truck only now, but he has over 190, 000 miles on it!  It has been quite dependable.  We have had it in the shop for only regular maintenance.  As far as the ride goes, it is pretty smooth and quite.  The cab is small and there is not a lot of leg room, but two adults can ride comfortably.
