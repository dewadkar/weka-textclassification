            I bought this because the price was super low at $60, and the brand was kodak. True to its name, this kodak camera gives very good quality pictures. I dont think that for home use you need more than 1 megapixel. minimum resolution needed for 4x6 prints is 640x480. thats about 0.3 megapixel. So at 1 megapixel u can have prints 2 orders greater. Home users should concentrate more on other features. Now this camera features:

1. 3 picture quality: the lowest quality of 576x432 isnt good enough even for 4x6 print, so is useless. higher and highest quality at 1152x864 are good. the image size is around 300 KB for highest quality, around 150 KB for higher one, and around 50 KB for least one. So on a 16 MB compactflash card (this camera houses a compactflash card slot) you can have around 50 best quality, or around 100 better quality pictures.

2. This camera can be hooked to any NTSC TV (TVs found in US) using a video cable thats not available anywhere, except for a few websites. not even Kodak online shop has this video cable ( atleast i couldn't find one). the price is very low on the sites its available ( around 5 bucks), so can't think of why kodak didn't include it in the original pack. 
 Also this camera can't be hooked to a PAL TV ( TVs found in europe and asia), although its canadian version can be. Doesn't matter for an American buyer, but is a negative for an Indian like me. 

3.Since digital zoom can be taken only at the lowest resolution, its not much (read that 'any') use.

4.flash can be operated in automatic, on and off mode. This is helpful. Default is auto. so this is actually a point and shoot camera. no settings required.

5. shutter speed is fixed. Thats a low. keep the camera too close, and the contrast is too great.

MOST IMPORTANT
6.Almost everyone here mentions that batteries run out fast. I was very impressed with the performance of Ni-MH cells.. I bought 4 pairs of Duracell 1800mAh Ni-MH AA cells and a duracell charger for 4 AA (or AAA) cells for just $25 from rite-aid. So i take turns with 2 pairs. And with each 2 pair i get something like 50-60 photographs( and i use LCD mostly for taking and reviewing the pictures). So i think this is good performance. I guess all that have given negative feedback on battery performance have dealt with alkaline cells. This way i dont need an ac adapter too.

7. The PC connectivity is the most negative feature on this camera. It uses an ultra slow serial connection. ( even more slow on the internal memory (?!?) ) So you have to buy a usb card reader or pc card adapter for faster transfers.

For the picture quality u can check the page where i have kept my pictures. http://www.angelfire.com/weird/vivek
The first four links lead to thumbnail pages of all the pictures i have taken from this camera.


MY EXPERIENCE: Use the flash options intelligently and you will get good pictures, in almost all situations.
