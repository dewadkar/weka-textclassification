            The 1996 Legacy Outback is a most trustworthy car, dependable and tough, and it just won't get stuck.

Subaru builds a sporting machine with a great deal of practicality, which all the small Japanese cars seem to offer. The Subaru goes them all one better with its wonderful driveablility and unique all-weather capability. With its antilock brakes and AWD, the car is supremely capable not matter what the weather or road surface throw its way.

The steering weight and feel are top-notch, and my car has the manual gearbox which adds to the sporting flavor. The gearbox and clutch are easy to use and should prove great for training the neophyte in the art of driving. I do wish it had more power, which was available in the 2.5 liter version. But the 2.2 motor is torquey and willing, so the car feels quite responsive.

I have had only a few problems, including a bad interior lamp switch, a bad spark plug wire, an alternator replacement under factory recall, and a leaking rear side window fixed under warranty. Dealer service has been excellent here in Raleigh, NC, at Southern States Imports.

I never track gas mileage. Though these AWD Subarus use a bit more fuel than similar front-wheel drive cars, the safety and security advantages of AWD more than offset the bit of extra fuel used.

The rear seat is particularly comfortable and roomy, with a proper cushion, a good angle, and good foot and legroom. The cargo capacity is remarkable: even a four foot width of plywood will fit, with careful loading, within the opening of the rear hatch. Interior storage space is fine, with a good glovebox, door bins, and a useful center box that will hold several CDs. Instrumentation is eminently readable and the controls and displays are delightfully simple and clear. The HVAC system is very effective and powerful. My car has the useful cold weather package with heated seats, heated outside mirrors, and an engine block heater.

Outward visibility is excellent. The cabin has an open, airy feel and a fine driving position which allows the driver to feel in good command of the machine, and the body design is such that the car is easy to park without fear that you don't know where the ends of the car are.

This car has a very solid and stiff body structure. It seems a long-wearing machine, a very solid piece of automotive hardware. Even the materials and textures inside offer that impression. 

Subaru ownership was once the territory mainly of teachers and those who really didn't like cars but had to have one, and they have gained something of a cult car status. I like to think of them as Davids among all the silly Goliaths on the market, genuinely intelligent machines that get the job without fuss. There's no fluff here, just competence. And I like the style. It's purposeful and has a certain elegance without pretense, with form following function very nicely.

Subarus seem to get better with each model year. Certainly they have become more refined, more luxurious, fancier, and more costly. I hope that the traditional Subaru virtues remain intact, because when mine is worn out, I want to replace it with another. I can't really think of any other cars that make as much sense.

By the way, the name "Subaru" means "unite" in Japanese, a reference to the unification of several companies in the early 1950s which led to the birth of Subaru cars. And the six stars on the Subaru badge represent the constellation Pleiades, so the Subaru is well-connected to the stars in the heavens and knows its place in the universe as a car for all seasons and all reasons.
