            My husband and I spent a long time agonizing over what kind of digital camera to buy.  The two main deciding factors for us were the type of battery used and the photo storage format.  We decided on the Sony MVC-FD83 because it comes with a relatively long lasting battery that is rechargeable and we decided that the convenience of being able to pop a floppy disk directly from the camera into the computer would be great.  Another plus for the floppies is that they are cheap to buy and you don't need any special computer hardware.  Any computer with a photo viewing program can be used as your photo developer.  In fact the camera sets up a web page based viewing system that you can easily point and click to view photos.  A downside of floppies is that they don't store large amounts of data (10-20 pictures on average depending on resolution, or 1-15 short video clips) so expect to carry around bags of disks, or a laptop.  Still this is not too much of a hassle.  Another thing about the floppies is that you have to be sure that they and your camera stay quite clean.  We discovered this by using an older floppy that we recycled into 'film'.  It made the floppy drive on our camera and then our computer go into convulsions.  Luckily a simple disk cleaner picked up from Office Max solved the problem quite handily.  Overall this is a great camera to use and the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Digital cameras are the wave of the future, no more film development costs! :)<br><br>
