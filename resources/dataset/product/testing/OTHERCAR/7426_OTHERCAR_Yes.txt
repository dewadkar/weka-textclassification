            I have been driving a new Volvo S40 for about a month now.  My #1 priority when buying a car is safety, which is why I chose a Volvo.  Despite the fact that the S40 is the &quot;cheap&quot; Volvo, it is loaded with the safety features that Volvo is known for, and is really a great value for the price.

<b>The Engine</b>
The S40 comes with a base 4-cylinder, 1.9L engine with 160 Horse Power.  My last car was a V6, and while I do miss having a V6, the Volvo S40 is still quite fast.  While it doesn't have as much pickup from a stop as a V6, the &quot;light touch&quot; turbo makes it easy to get the speed you need when you need it.  I live at the top of a mountain in Los Angeles, and have no issues with the Volvo's performance on a steep incline.  The only transmission available on the car is a 5-speed automatic.  The ride is smooth and quiet for a car in this price range.


<b>Safety Features</b>
The S40 is loaded with 'em:
- Dual Stage Airbags- the airbags deploy at different forces depending on the severity of the crash. 

- Side curtain airbags- an airbag deploys from the side of the roof and &quot;curtains&quot; both the front and back seat windows, protecting the occupants' heads from the glass.

- Side driver/passenger seat airbags.  This airbag pops out of the side of both the driver and passenger front seats, so no matter how far forward or back you keep the seat, you are protected in the event that you are hit from the side

- Whiplash protection system- If you are rear-ended, the front seats will tilt back and down, reducing whiplash.

<b>Styling</b>
I will confess, I don't really like the look of the S40.  But I didn't choose it for the styling, so I can't complain.  To me, the S40 has the look of a Japanese car (a Nissan or something).   Aside from the front grill and lights, it doesn't really have the &quot;volvo&quot; look.  Adding on the rear spoiler, however, helps.

<b>Interior Features</b>
This is where my only problem with the S40 lies.  It seems that Volvo has skimped on the interior of the S40 a bit in order to keep the price down.  Certain interior features give the Volvo the look and feel of a much cheaper car- a cheap plastic steering wheel, small side-view mirrors, cheap plastic dashboard.  The seats are not particularly comfortable (especially after sitting in a really nice S70 that was sitting in the dealer showroom). The leather upgrade package (which I got) helps the interior look more luxurious, but it will cost you about $1200 extra.  Furthermore, just about everything you'd want is an option- the base model is just that- basic.  Power driver's seat- extra.  CD Player- extra.  Wood interior- extra.  Rear spoiler- extra.  You get the picture.  Getting all the bells and whistles could easily cost you several thousand dollars over the base price.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I suppose I can't complain too much, however.  If this is what Volvo had to do to make a nice and safe car available to the masses, then so be it.
Again, I didn't buy my Volvo for the bells and whistles- I bought it for the safety features.  And Volvo did NOT skimp on safety in order to deliver a reasonably priced model.<br><br>
