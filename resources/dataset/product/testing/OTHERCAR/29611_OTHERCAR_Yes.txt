            The lease was up on my 2001 Ram so I thought I would take the plunge into the new HEMI world with the updated body. Being that I still had 4 months left before the turn in on my old truck I decided to build one myself MY WAY instead of compromising with something off the lot.  Dodge's website   www.dodge.com    there is a place to price and build the truck within your budget or dreams , whichever may be higher. With only one kid who is setting off to college I thought I would pamper myself and fully load the truck to the max. 10 weeks later ..the truck was sitting at the dealer waiting for pick up . One turn of the key and listening to the throatee HEMI I was hooked. Pure muscle ... the state of the art tranny that is hooked with it is basically geared on the upper end , so while its not a rocket off the line ...she'll get up and go after 60. The handling is basically like a car as the front axle is now history. The 20 inch wheels hold to the road extremely well considering the size of the truck.  Inside the Laramie leather and options will make you feel like a king..  the infinity sound system is one of the best units Dodge has ever installed. Although the dual heat/ac I thought was a tad corny , it has actually has came in handy. The heated seats are a really nice extra for the money. The only real drawback I have came across is an easy trip lever to access behind the seat is missing , its a complete nuisance to use the regular lever as you have to re-adjust the seat when you climb back in. Space behind the seats is plentiful as Dodge reduced the bed by 3 inches to increase the interior room. All in all the truck is a major step up from the old style and as I at first wasn't a new ram fan it rapidly grew on me to the point of preferring this body style over the older version. If you are considering a test drive at your local dealer ...plan on driving it away.
