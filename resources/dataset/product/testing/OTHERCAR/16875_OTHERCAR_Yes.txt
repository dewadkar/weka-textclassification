            When I lost my 85 Maxima in the divorce, my Nissan trained mechanic swooned over my 5-year-old '90 Maxima when I acquired it with 35K miles in '95.  Now I know why.
Apart from the obvious comfort and performance, this automobile has been so extraordinarily reliable I declined to trade it for a '95 at zero cost. Up to 130,000, the car required nearly no service apart from the expected.

The big bills came only this year, though I still can't complain on balance. The unexpected repair jobs can be counted on one hand: Alternator, Driver's door latch and window switch, center engine support strut, lower conrol arms, brake master cylinder.

I intend to drive this car until the transmission fails because I just can't bring myself to part with it after so many years of trouble free performance. I only wish I had another just like it. 

If you own one, change the timing belt every 60K and the oil every 3K and replace the driver's door lock and latch mechanism NOW, before it fails or you will find yourself locked in the car and require a magician to replace it after it has broken. Fortunately, I know one.

I was livid when I lost my old '85 Maxima to my ex, but it turns out my mechanic was right about the superior quality of the '90.  Wives are easier to replace than a good mechanic and '90 Maxima is a keeper I'll be holding on to 'til death do us part.
