            In the 5 years that I have had my accent, I have NEVER had to plug this 
car in.  I'm situated in North Central Ontario, where long winter nights
can reduce the temperature to -35C and colder.  No matter how cold it has
gotten, it has always started with very little hesitation (if any) and never a boost needed.  Needless to say, I'm impressed and I've put off 
purchasing a SUV until their new Santa Fe comes out (hoping that it will be just as good!)  Only fair to say though, that in the first 6 months that I had the vehicle both the transmission and the radio went - but it was under warranty so I was not overly concerned.  Since then, the car
has cost me very little to maintain, and I certainly wouldn't hesitate in
purchasing another.<br><br>
