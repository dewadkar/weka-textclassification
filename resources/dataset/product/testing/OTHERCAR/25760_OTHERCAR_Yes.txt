            I have owned my new beetle for almost a year now. I love it! It has plenty of room (I'm 6ft6in tall). It is great on gas mileage. The Volkswagen company as a whole is probably the best car company to buy from. They take care of their customers with paying for the servicings for the first 20,000 miles. They have the best looking accessories that you can buy to go with your new beetle.

I consider it the car of the future. Sure, you can look at all your classic cars and what-not, but when i go driving by, people's heads turn and look at the future.

If at anytime i think i will need to get a new car, i will go back and buy the newest beetle that is available.
