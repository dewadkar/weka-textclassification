            I love my Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera!

Once I reviewed the features of the camera with a knowledgeable salesperson, buying this camera was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; decision. 

This is THE camera for any serious photographer who wants a camera purchase under $1,000.

(many years ago)I was our college photographer for newspaper releases and for the yearbook, in addition I done both still and video wedding photography and photography for annual reports. 
I'm spoiled, as I was use to having a good, dependable camera at my side.

Some of the criteria that I wanted in my digital camera were:
1) A through the lens viewer - WISIWIG
2) Flexibility to handle a variety of lighting situations (average metering system, spot metering, etc.)
3 The ability to shoot high resolution Tif and Jpg image formats (to put into MS Word and Power Point presentations)
4) a zoom lens so I could crop my photos right on the screen, 
5) a flash option ... built in; didn't want to carry additional equipment,
6) I DID NOT WANT TO RUN out of power or image storage space!
7) Ability to run the camera from ac current vs. batteries.
8) Rechargeable batteries when I didn't want to use ac.

My first experience with the camera was in a grape vineyard outside Portland, Oregon. I was shooting visuals to incorporate into Power Point slides for a contemporary church service. It did everything that I wanted to do (above). The ability to shoot and instantly play back one or any number of photos in memory, on the camera LCD screen, all the photos that I took gave me confidence that I had all the shots that I needed.
Shooting pictures was FUN again!

OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT:
The camera comes with 8MB of flash memory ... I replaced it immediately with an 80 MB (yes 80)&quot;compact flash&quot; memory chip which provides enough capacity to take over a thousand low-resolution photos or hundreds of high-resolution photos (you can change the resolution on screen).
Well worth the extra cost.

I also advise buying the Nikon EH-30 (U) AC Adapter,
and the Harding Energy, Inc. &quot;Quest&quot; Battery charger.
Oh yes, don't forget to buy (or have your dealer give you .. you spent enough money with this guy!) a lens cover ... to protect your investment.

The Nikon name and my previous experience with Nikon was a major factor in buying this model.

DIFFICULTIES:
I work with computers, so I was able to get it to interface with my pc rather quickly.  I could see; however, where some folks could have difficulty in getting the images into their PC.  The directions that come with the camera are &quot;poor&quot; ... like a technical person wrote them, not a user. there is a web site for technical help ... but frankly, it appears to be more of the same .. not much help.

How I get Photos into my PC:
I just plug an interface into my camera and into the serial port on my PC. I use the software provided to view the images that are in the camera on my pc screen and then drag and drop the ones I want to keep either onto the Windows start page or into a specific directory that I opened with my NT Explorer.

Since that trip to the vineyard, I shot about one hundred photos under a variety of conditions.  Now I have to go back and read the directions (it's a &quot;man&quot; thing) to take advantage of more of the features that are available. The documentation says that I can print the photos up to 11x14 size - haven't tried that yet, but the 8x10's were excellent, photo-like in quality.

It's has NTSC video signal which provides the capability to display on my television screen, but I haven't tried that yet ... Mostly use on my 17&quot; PC screen.
