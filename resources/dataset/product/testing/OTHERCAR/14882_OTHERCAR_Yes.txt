            I bought this camera when I decided to take a trip to Hawaii. I wanted to make sure I had good pictures and this was a wonderful way to find out before leaving the spot where the picture was taken. It worked out great. I would take a picture and then look at it. If I didn't like it i would just take another one and delete the other one. 

It also helped in that my mother-in-law also went on the trip. She is in a wheelchair, therefor not able to get out of the bus every time we stopped. I would go take the pictures and then go and show her what was out there. She was able to enjoy the view as well even though she wasn't able to get off the bus.

This camera is great to just hold and shoot. It was wonderful to just hold the camera at the window and take pictures as we drove along. Every picture taken this was also turned out great. The pictures were clear. The camera is small and light weight. I can take many 3.5 inch disks with me and know that I will have enough &quot;picture&quot; space I need for whatever pictures I want to take. 

My main problem was the life of the battery. I solved this problem by buying an extra that I kept charged at all times. In doing this I was sure to always have a charged battery.

Anyone who is interested in a digital camera should look into this. It is very easy to use. It can be taken anywhere. As long as you have a charged battery and a disk you have it made. It is the most wonderful camera that I have ever owned. <br><br>
