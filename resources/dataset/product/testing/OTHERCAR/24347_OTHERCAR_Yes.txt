                 I got this truck over the Tacoma because of the overall look, space, and engine.  I did my homework like going on the net to look for reviews like here and other sites.  and yeah the majority of them looks as if the Dodge has a bad reputation.  What really sold me was again the look, room, and the Magnum V6 engine.  

     I own mines for almost 3 months now and am very pleased with its performance.  I'm a semi-mechanic myself and did some modifications on my Dodge.  Well..... with some help from my pro mechanic friends.  

     I modified computer system by installing a performance chip and 180 degree thermostat.  What that did was fine tune my Dodge so it would run to the style of how I'm driving.  It changed the air ratio of the intake right down to the transmission changing to having the engine run cooler so that the wear and tear would be a minimum.

     I immediately changed the engine motor oil.  I used a synthetic type brand and added an motor type additive.  Just to justify it's Magnum engine.  I even added an additive for the transmission also.  For security purposes.  Hey it's run even smoother.  Trust me.

     Lastly, I changed it's stock muffler.  I changed to a performance type muffler.  That also takes the heat away from the engine. Again taking away much of the wear and tear.

     Now here is the pros and cons about this truck.  I'm always buying performance parts for this truck.  The &quot;con&quot;.  What can I say......  I don't want to see my truck as a statistic like some of the other reviews in here.  Enough said........

     This is for the single man.........  the Club Cab can impressively fit more room that I opt for..... oh and this is not for a family man.

    Hopefully, you all won't see me again posting that I blew up the truck because of all its faults.  He, he, he, he!!!  <br><br>
