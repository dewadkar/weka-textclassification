            I'll defer to the reviews by aashook, majid, and fashfoto for most of the details.

If your first review of this camera is the group you are reading here, let me say:

This is a superb camera for the money.  Coupled with a Canon 28-135 Image Stabilization (IS)lens, you can take indoor shots without flash that really work. The 800 and 1600 ISO settings produce usable photographs, which can be shot handheld down to 1/10th of a second with an IS lens.

I stress this feature here (and not much else) since I think most readers of this review are reading it "from below": that is, wondering from the point of view of middle or upper-middle package digital cameras whether it pays to take this step up.

Most heartily yes, if your venue will be low-light candids where you would rather not or aren't allowed to blow the mood of the event with flash.

You'll want to carry it intensively and shoot a lot until all the buttons and dials become second nature.  If it turns out to be 'too much' for your needs, the body and lens will still command a decent resale price for awhile.

More than likely, though, you'll hang onto it, having found out what a joy it is to shoot so quickly and easily in all kinds of light, and you'll be thumbing the Canon lens pamphlet catalog and your checkbook. This body is good enough to make your next lens worth the money.

Based on my experience, minimum extra stuff for this camera is a good lens, an extra battery, and a couple of 'fast' 256 or 512 MByte Compact Flash memory cards.  I bought the grip also, but more for the shutter and control buttons it makes handy in portrait mode, than for the uninterrupted battery time.

My flash unit is a 420 EX. Like the lens, it's a carryover from my Canon film SLR. You may still want an external flash: if so, Canon stresses the 550 EX. But you may not need it very often, so clean are the high ISO results with this camera.

A good film SLR will shoot pictures quicker and with less lag (there isn't much lag in the 10D, but still some). And film will still give you more dynamic range than a chip sensor. But film won't let you shoot a hundred shots of one scene with instant feedback. If want to see if you can learn how to shoot well by sheer repetition, this camera will let you try that method, and won't box you in.
