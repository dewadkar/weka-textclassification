            First of all, this will not be a review containing horsepower information, 0 to 60 stats, true gas mileage charts, etc.  There are plenty of reviews out there that do a good job of covering that information.  This is my female review of the 2002 Chevy Trailblzer. 

I knew I wanted my next car to be an SUV.  Monitarily, I found myself looking into the Mini-SUV market.  I test drove the Ford Escape, the Jeep Liberty, the Hyndai Santa Fe, etc.  But somehow last Feb, I found myself buying a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer :)

The 2002 Chevy Trailblazer is a completely new body design from General Motors.  They must have seen the need to compete with the Explorer crowd and increase the size of the Blazer.  The Trailblazer is in family of similar GM SUV's (GMC- Envoy, Olds- Bravada, Buick- Rainer (soon to come)).

Getting into the Trailblazer, you feel like you are in a beast of a car (well coming from a Pontiac Grand Am, you do).  There is plenty of legroom in the front and back (something the mini-SUV's lack).  The seats are big and comfortable.  The dash isn't too over powering like some of the GM mini-vans from the 80's.  You sit up pretty high.

Now for the test drive.  I had a limited exposure to full size SUV's.  I drove my friend's 2002 Envoy (her nails where wet) and another friend's 2002 Ford Explorer (he was under the influence).  So I was pretty much an SUV virgin.  It took a bit getting used to sitting up so high above everyone else.  Turning was also a HUGE issue.  I felt as if I was going to tip over with every corner I took.  Luckily that feeling is now gone, and I haven't tipped it over.

I've been told I'm an aggressive driver :)  I like to get going as fast as possible, as soon as possible.  Here I am, in a HUGE SUV with only a tiny V-6 engine (I've always made sure my cars were atleast a V-6.  My lovley 90' Olds I drove in high school had a beefy V-8).  Now I'd be lying if I said this thing flies off the line.  Don't try to race any Mustangs.  But overall it has the pick-up I need for my driving style.  

Now onto the 4x4 option.  Being in Michigan, we splurged for the 4x4 LS version.  Never having a 4x4 before, I had NO idea what to expect.  Most of this winter was snowless, so I didn't utilize the 4x4 much.  But it did come in handy when we did use it.  Traveling back from the UP at Thanksgiving, we drove into a near white-out.  My husband flipped the TB (as we call it) into AWD and took off, no slipping, no sliding!  To test it we flipped off the 4x4 and definetly saw the difference.

The LS version of the Trailblazer comes with some nice features.  The CD radio is decent.  With no speakers in the rear storage area, you can't get the car "bumpin", but it fits our needs 99% of the time.  I LOVE the dual climate control.  My husband can bust into a sweat when it's 10 degrees outside, where as I can have goose bumps when it's 70!  So having the ability to control our own heat/ac is nice.  3 cup holders in the front, is a feature I love!  Having only one cup holder in the 99' Grand Am, makes you really apperciate 3 :)  The 2 cigarette lighters (well one lighter, one port) make it convient to be charging a cell phone and running a radar detector.  The large map pockets on the door are handy for storing CD's, maps, papers, books, etc.  The middle console (or hoofer as we call it) is nice and deep for lots of storage.  It also has grooves for holding CD's if you prefer.

The middle row of seats have their own features too.  There are an additional 2 cup holders that flip down onto the "hump".  The middle seats also have their own climate control panel and cigarette "port".  The middle row seats flip in a 40/60 split making it convient to haul boxes, skis, bookcases, 10' trees, etc (done all of them).  There is also a small amount of storage available under the seats.

The rear cargo area is nice and roomie.  It features a "hidden" storage compartment.  There are also to side storage compartments.  The rear cargo area also has the 4th cigarette "port".  The back hatch has strap to add in pulling it down (from inside or out).  The back hatch also has the option of just opening the rear window.  The back window also has a rear wiper!  

One thing my LS did NOT come with but we added on later is remote keyless entry.  I STRONGLY suggest you get that option.  The rear hatch can only UNLOCK by key.  To lock the hatch you have to use the car's main locks!  VERY ANNOYING!

Here I sit, one year and 30,000 miles later and I'm still as in love with my TB!  Like I said, I was pricing mini-SUV's at the time, so getting something like the TB, with as much as it offers was a great surprise!  After the GM discount (thanks Uncle Tim and Mom) and the $2500 in rebates, we drove off the lot with a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer LS 4x4 for the same price as a Ford Escape 4x2!
