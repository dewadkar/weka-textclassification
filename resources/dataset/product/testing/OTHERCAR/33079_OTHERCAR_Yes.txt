            The Sonoma is a great truck..The only complaint that i have is there isn't enough room on the passenger side..It gets kind of cramped over there..This truck is smooth riding..It has really great gas mileage..We drove from Alabama to Kentucky and back on one and a half tanks of gas..The fully loaded model comes with a really good stereo to be a factory stereo..It has plenty of storage are behind the sit which is really good for those trips..The Sonoma is also a very powerful truck for a small truck..I can honestly say that other than the amount of leg room on the passenger side that this is a great truck and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new vehicle..<br><br>
