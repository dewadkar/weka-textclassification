            We've been starting to think about what car will replace my wife's 1997 Audi A4 1.8T, and I suggested we look at the Acura TSX. Being a car for my wife, we value dependability, style and ease of use. Being a car guy, I value a connected, fun to drive experience. 

My other cars are a Subaru WRX Impreza and a RWD Mazda Miata, so you can tell I like smaller nimble cars that are fun to drive on twisting roads. I don't need a lot of engine power because the fun of driving a car is not mashing the pedals, but negotiating corners skillfully at higher speeds. My preferences are for cars that emphasize the connection to the driver, cars that don't filter much of the driving experience. Hence I prefer cars like the quirky rough-around-the-edges WRX and the go-kart-like Miata. 

So this TSX is interesting because, although it is based on the smaller European market Honda Accord, it has some changes that upgrade it from a regular family hauler to something a bit more resembling a true sports sedan. The uprated 200HP 2.4 L iVTEC engine with a high 7100 RPM redline. Add to it, the upgraded interior treatment, more aggressive suspension, and drivetrain that includes an 5 speed "manu-matic" transmission or 6 speed manual, both for the same price.

The car is fully equipped, there are very few options besides things like extra wood trim, and spoiler. For US buyers, navigation is the major upgrade option. Everything in the base model is there: leather, power everything, security, 8 speaker six-disc in-dash CD stereo, dual auto climate control, homelink, heated seats/mirrors, telescopic steering wheel, remote controlled windows, moonroof, etc. I am reviewing the Canadian model by the way. We were happy with the exhaustive list of standard amenties for the asking price of $35000 Canadian dollars. 

So we decide to take a test drive. Here is how it went. 

I won't comment too much about the exterior styling. It's a sharply styled car. It is quite striking as seen on the road with its chiselled tight look about it. As for the interior. Hmm, nice ambience, businesslike, with a nice Teutonic flavour like a BMW or Audi. It looks quite posh without bordering on tackiness with too many wood touches. I was looking at the dark rather than the tan interior, and the fit and finish was top rate, equal or better than a regular Accord and better than most other cars in this price range. As good as my benchmark 1997 Audi A4 even which says a lot. A close competitor, Mazda 6 sedan doesn't not even come in the same ballpark. The instruments are highly legible due to its snazzy backlit LED gauges, I still prefer the very clear gauges of my WRX which are so simple and uncluttered. The feel of the switches is excellent as if the internals were covered in magic grease. The ergonomics were sound, I could operate all the secondary controls without explanation, and everything fell to my hand easily despite my short frame. Particularly nice was the clear climate and radio controls. And we definitely appreciated the standard dual-climate control. A great place to spend some time.

So we get the keys and roll out of the lot. The sight lines are decent, but as with most modern cars, the high trunklid made it a harder to judge the length of the car when backing up. I've always liked the lower seating position of Hondas. The shifter is very very good. Not S2000 nor Miata class, but maybe 85% as precise, but it's a slick affair that and has a good degree of connectedness and mechanical feel without feeling crude in any way. Slightly forgiving and never brutal, it's a bit lacking in weight which didn't make me want to rifle-bolt it just for the fun of it, but it was satisfying. 

The ride is firm, sports-sedan firm. I would place it a step lower in stiffness compared to my friskier WRX, but it was noticeably firmer than a regular Accord especially wearing big 17 inch wheels. The overall quietness of the car was very good, not much noticable wind noise, and the engine noise was not obtrusive at full cruising speed. Pavement tar strips are heard, but muted. Like all Hondas, the suspension feels planted at all times and larger irregularities in the pavement are heard but mostly not felt in any big way. I took a decreasing radius offramp, and poked at the throttle mid-turn to see how it would react. Jabbing at throttle a bit, the back end nicely tucked in, it reactly nicely to the provocation, the tail would take on a new set stance instantly and didn't budge after that...a good sign of a well balanced handler. There was a bit of body roll but nothing objectionable in this class of car and the handling remained sharp even though very aggressive manoevers. The steering was as accurate as my WRX, and was weighted nicely, light enough for anybody to find it easy to drive but still offering a reasonable degree of feedback. My pet peeve is dull steering, and this Acura was not dull or artificial feeling in any way. Audi, aren't you paying attention? Sure this is FWD, but it's a wonderful handler no matter what I could throw at it. For spirited driving, it would be a fun car to throw around. As a car for my wife, I feel confident that the handling would provide few surprises for her. I usually pan Front Wheel Drive cars because I dislike the compromises in feel and control that is inherent in FWD. But this TSX nearly made me forget that. For most normal driving situations, it felt composed, but the feel of the handling is well honed.

The engine. It's no BMW 330 inline six. It was plenty smooth for a four cylinder, as good as they come, and it's torque down even at 2500 rpm is very impressive (with peak torque at 4500RPM), I would never have guessed this is an engine from a maker that builds peaky 9000 RPM S2000 engines. It builds its power progressively so it's not a peaky motor at all. In terms of refinement, if you start comparing this engine to even the base 320 or 325 engines, and this is where the Acura will betray its more humbler roots. The classic Honda clatter on start up brought back memories of my last Honda. All-in-all, the engine was good, better than I expected, but there are no miracles as even the best four cylinder doesn't compare to a six'er 

So would I buy this car? Not for myself, as I prefer the raw friskiness that you only get in a Subaru WRX. The FWD'ness would eventually bother me with my more aggressive driving tendencies, but it's well loaded and the value of the car is excellent despite its lack of six cylinders and RWD/AWD. Even though this is a new model, it seems that people are getting good deals on them. If so it stands alone among entry level sports luxury sedans. When it comes time to upgrade that A4 for my wife, this will definitely be near the top of our list to consider. 

So I came out of the showroom with respect for Honda in offering this car. It's ludicrous of Honda to compare the car to more upscale V6 competitors like the Infiniti G35, or any BMW 3 series (which I would say would appeal to a different demographic who demand either six cylinder or Rear Wheel/All-Wheel Drive), but it slots in nicely for those who look for 3 series precision but with Honda sensibilities, and value. In its price range, we have cars like the Mazda 6, much larger Maxima or Altima, and oddball niche cars like my WRX. So it pretty much stands alone in offering such a complete car for a reasonable asking price.
