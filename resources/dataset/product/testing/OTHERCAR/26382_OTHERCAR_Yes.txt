            I just purchased my Olds in March of 2000. I really like it a lot. I had a Mercury Villager (1993 and still have it -please read the updated reviews on this on.) My olds has more leg room for my growing boys ( I have 3 boys-2 teenagers and they need a lot of leg room. also my 9 year old needs room to play in the van). So far my vans runs tip-top, but it should for being new. One thing with all new vehicles-I have to read the manual a couple of times to figure out some of the features on my van-how to check a few things and reset the buttons-but Call your salesman and make them show you how to work the gadgets-it saves a lot of time.
I like the way the seats can be moved up for more room. Also I like the way the back seats fold up for added storage-very easy to do and so convenient. The van handles well. I already took in on one vacation when I only had a few hundred miles on it-no problems. I plan on taking it to Florida at the end of June (We live in Ohio) so we will see how it operates then. I like the computerized feathers that my van has on it, but I had to reset the &quot;change oil&quot;feature on it when it reminded me to change oil. I did have a little problem resetting that-but after reading the manual a couple of times-I did reset it. My suggestion contact your salesman to have them help you understand the features. I think I will like my Olds just as much as my Mercury Villager-if not more. We will see after 240,000 miles ( which my villager has on it-my son will have this villager for his first car/van). I will up date this after I return from Florida. <br><br>
