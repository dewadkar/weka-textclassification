            I recently took a dusk test drive in the new 2003 Infiniti G35. In some respects this was a great car, in others I was less than unimpressed. If you are under 6' and want a sporty car with little on the inside, perhaps this is the car for you. If you are taking the wife and kids anywhere, look for a different car. 

The G35 is similar to the G20 in respect to its insides. There is absolutely nothing special about it. There is no curve to dazzle the eye and no luxury that really stands out as making this a good car. Everything is downgraded from the higher end models or just missing altogether from this car. Everything seems to have gone into the driving abilities of this car and nothing to the creature comforts. 

The seats are supposedly molded to the driver to give him a comfortable drive. I did not find this to be the case. The seat was already starting to be a little uncomfortable after our 15 minute test drive. My legs could not easily fit into the well and I had trouble sitting up straight as I like to do when I drive. The leather on the seats was not the best I have experienced. 

The instrument panel was hard to read because of its amber color. I found that both in the afternoon and in the evening when I was sitting in the car looking at its control panel, I found it hard to read. Other instruments are also washed out in the car. The Infiniti signature clock is difficult to read and also gets lost in the sunshine. One nice thing is that Infiniti did not put in auto-dimming mirrors outside. These can often make it difficult to judge the distance of the car behind you. 

The leg room in the back of the car was not adequate. After adjusting my drivers seat to where I wanted it, I tried sitting in the back directly behind the drivers seat. I had to squeeze my legs sideways to fit them in. I am just over 6 feet tall and not the tallest in my family. This is definitely not a car you want when you have to take adult friends with you somewhere. 

The great thing about this car though, is its ability to drive. The G35 comes with Nissan&#146s fantastic 3.5L DOHC V6. This is one of the best engines on the market today. It is definitely more than this car needs and because of that, this car can really go. When you touch the gas, it is hard to hold not only the engine back, but to restrain yourself as well. I was flying down the roads during my test drive. The open stretches were the one part of my test drive I actually enjoyed. 

The handling on this car is fantastic. There was literally almost no roll in the corners. I was taking these corners very fast and I was in absolute control the whole time. The car did not move except for exactly when and where I told it to. The only thing about high speeds in this car is that it gets very noisy at highway speeds. The wind struggled with the music I had going on the stereo. 

The stereo on this car was not what I expected. Being a Bose, I thought it would have incredible sound. I was unimpressed by its weakness and inability to compete with the road noise. The layout of the speakers is also not as well done as on some other Infiniti cars. 

One of the nice things about this car is its climate control. It is pretty much set-it-and-forget-it. There is a climate control for each side of the car and that works rather well. I specifically tried to set my side about 5 degrees cooler than the other side and I did notice a big difference when I placed my hand on that side. 

Another nice thing on this car is the light it can produce. It has xenon lights for the low beams and halogens for the high beams. The xenons are exceptionally bright and really light up the road. When the halogens are on, you can see everything very clearly because of the combination of the two lights. The xenons are very pointed and cut off at a specific place. They do not seem to point at the other drivers. This is important to me because I know how much I hate it when I see xenons going down the road and I am blinded by their super bright lights that are pointed in my direction. This does not appear to happen with the G35. 

Trunk space on this car is limited. I didn't try to put anything in there but it did not look like it would hold much. Perhaps two large suitcases could fit in there and then some things could squeezed into the corners. Considering the size of the car, the trunk should be larger. 

The exterior of the car is also new for Infiniti. They went a new direction with most of their cars this year. They have more rounded profiles and are meant to be easier on the eyes. The changes may not be welcome by all. I certainly do not appreciate what Infiniti has done to its line.

In deference to the skilled auto manufacture taking place at Infiniti, I would like to mention the G35 coupe.  This is a car that I am looking forward to test driving and one that I love seeing fly by on the road.  Look for my review of this car coming soon.
