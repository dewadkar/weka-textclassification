            I got lucky this time -- the Enterprise office didn't have the vehicle class I'd ordered, so instead of giving me one of those puny Ford Escorts again (see my review of 12 March), they let me take a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Little did they know how eager I was to have it -- not so much to <i>drive</i> it as to <i>review</i> it!  So I kept their beast for four days and five hundred miles, yet another in my seemingly endless string of trips from Austin to Houston on business.

The Grand Cherokee is a slightly larger and apparently "grander" version of the Cherokee that is available in two trim levels: Laredo and Limited. Mine was a two-wheel drive Laredo, and came with the standard 4.0-litre in-line 6-cylinder engine and three-speed overdrive automatic transmission. The six-cylinder engine generates the healthy 195 horsepower needed to accelerate a relatively heavy vehicle (3800+/- pounds curb weight). The power train as configured yielded an average trip gasoline usage of 17.8 MPG, under mostly highway conditions. This is relatively low fuel economy for a six-cylinder but relatively high for an SUV. The fuel tank is sized to give the vehicle about a four-hundred mile driving range at this mileage. A 4.7-litre V-8 power plant that generates 235 horsepower is optional, as are both a five-speed manual and a five-speed overdrive automatic transmission. 

The appointments are most of what sets this vehicle apart from the more utilitarian Cherokee models. My champagne-colored Grand Cherokee came tricked out with standard air conditioning, dual airbags, a cargo-bay net, a sliding cargo-bay cover, and makeup mirrors on both sun visors. It also boasted AM-FM-cassette with front and rear speakers, cruise control, intermittent wipers, tilt-wheel steering, cigarette lighter plus additional power port, front- and rear-seat cup holders, and a data display mounted on the ceiling above the rearview mirror. For in-cab storage you'll find a glove compartment, small pockets on both doors, and a flip-top bay in the center console. The spare (temporary, of course --- ppppbbbbbbb! to the designers) and jack are located beneath the carpet in the cargo bay. The Grand Cherokee does not appear to be configured for a third seat (even as an option), so holds only five passengers (two front and three rear); rather skimpy for a vehicle of this mass.

The Grand Cherokee is big and burly; built to allow its passengers to ride high enough to see over those poor peasants in their little sedans. Although ostensibly the four-wheel drive version could be used for off-roading, the vehicle truly lacks sufficient ground clearance for rugged terrain, and it isn't designed for rough handling. Its exterior appearance is all angles and raised panels, from the signature toothy grin of a front grille to its lift-top rear gate. That gate can be opened as a single unit or the window may be popped separately; all doors and the tailgate are unlocked by a remote control.

The interior boasts color-matched carpeting and smooth surfaces, with ample padding in the dashboard. Recesses in the console and dashboard are textured to reduce slippage of small items, coins, keys, cassettes, and the like. The front seats are well-padded and supportive, of above-average comfort on road trips. The instrument cluster is well-appointed, with a tachometer and gauges for fuel, oil pressure, charging system, and temperature. There is a string of warning lights on the panel, allegedly including an idiot light to inform you that a gauge is out of range (we've come full circle!). A ceiling-mounted information console provides external temperature information, plus fuel and maintenance statistics. It also controls the function of the remote control and security features such as automatic door locks.

The six-cylinder engine responds smoothly and with enough power to accelerate the vehicle to highway speeds. It also allows the driver enough "punch" to pass on two-lane roads, especially if he clicks off the overdrive with the convenient shift-mounted button.

My sample was well-made, with no squeaks or rattles -- of course it only had 600 miles on the odometer when I returned it -- and no obvious finish defects. It was somewhat louder at highway speeds than expected; this being mainly road noise instead of engine noise.


<b>The brakes</b>

The Grand Cherokee is a relatively big vehicle; built for the same market as the Explorer, Durango, and Blazer. For such a large vehicle, however, it is remarkably cramped. When I -- by no means NBA- or NFL-sized (5'-11" and 188 lbs) sat in the driver's seat, my elbows constantly bumped into the console and the interior panels of the door. The seats have a wraparound sensation, adding further to the feeling of cramped space. Those seats, by the way, have small and rather fragile-looking manual adjusters for seatback tilt, and provide no adjustment to lumbar support. As someone who sits upright in the driver's seat instead of slouching, I was surprised by the relatively limited field of view provided by the windshield. The hood is long, and the roofline is low; from top to bottom the view was almost as narrow as looking through the gun slit on an armored vehicle. A large, low-mounted rearview mirror further obstructs the driver's field of view to the right side of the windshield, particularly above road level. 

The glove compartment is made minuscule by the passenger-side airbag: it's so tiny that the owner's manual and accompanying videotape fit into it only with difficulty. The center console storage is not lockable, so important small items must be placed in the glove box -- if they'll fit. That same airbag lacks an on-off switch; potentially dangerous to children and small adults who must sit in the front. 

The ride is -- in my experience -- typical of Jeeps and Cherokees. Over the past ten years, I've driven Cherokees on at least four extended trips. Universally, I have found that the steering is sloppy. These vehicles are prone to wander in their lane at highway speeds, as the front wheels are easily deflected by small textural changes in the road surface. The suspension is relatively soft: while the vehicle does not wallow like a tugboat in heavy seas (as does the Dodge Durango), neither does it iron out rough roads like a passenger car of similar cost. As with all SUVs, the risk of overturning when making emergency maneuvers is heightened by a relatively high center of gravity.


<b>Overall</b>

For those of you who insist on owning an SUV (and that particular fad seems to be slowing in favor of convertibles), the Cherokee is but an average entry in the field. It has a worse repair record than other vehicles in its class (Explorer, Blazer); but in my opinion is better made and more roadworthy than the Durango. It is expensive to own and drive than a passenger car: fuel costs, repair costs, and insurance are all above average, but again that's normal for SUVs. The purchase cost is lower than a comparably-equipped Toyota 4Runner or Nissan Pathfinder, however those other vehicles tend to be better-constructed (my opinion) and hold their value better (per the NADA).

My advice is to look long and hard before you buy this vehicle or a standard Cherokee. Do your research, and decide which vehicle (if any) meets your needs and your pocketbook before you buy. I hope this helps.
