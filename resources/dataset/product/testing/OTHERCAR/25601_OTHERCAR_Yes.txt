            I had a 1984 Saab, a 1996 Saab and now a 1999 S3.  One of the things I like the best about this car is the way it looks, which is what made me buy it in the first place.

While I love Saabs and the way they drive, the 93 is my fav so far.  Saab has said there were 1000 changes from the 900 to the current model.  One of the things I noticed is the handling, which is much tighter.  Also, the ride is slightly less bouncy and more steady.

Saab has continued to put the ignition on the floor and it has lots of cool features - the heated seats, CD player, back wiper and weather radio.  But perhaps the best part is the storage.  I have moved in and out of college and grad school in Saabs.  I have known people who have fit fridges and other large items in the back.  And when those seats go down the large mouth can fit almost anything.

My mom continues to proclaim that the Saab is a fun ride.  If you are not looking for a car that can hold five adults, what something that is cool looking with style and has lots of cargo space - check it out.

It also takes a beating. I was hit from the front and the rear at the same time during a Boston snowstorm and my car was the only one not on a  tow truck.
