            I've been watching the digital camera phenomenon for several years now. Last year I purchased a Kodak DC215 and was a bit disappointed. This year I bought the Nikon Coolpix800 for only a little more than what I paid for the DC215, and I am completely satisfied with it. This camera make sense both as a one-size-fits all solution for quality internet business and artistic use, and as a supplemental camera for a professional or serious amateur who needs a lightweight but still high quality tool for specific situations where the weight and bulk of professional equipment is not desired. 

The price-performance ratio of digital photography finally came into clear focus for me with this well-designed product. 

I had three different reasons for purchasing a digital camera:

1) Quick image-processing for the internet;

2) Visual reference &quot;notes&quot; for artistic projects;

3) Pure photography.

While the DC215 was _almost_ acceptable for application #1, for #2 and #3 it was wholly inadequate. The Coolpix800 excels on all three fronts.

Plus, its sturdy construction and light weight make it perfect for long mountain bike rides, full-day hikes, and tucking into my pocket when I go exploring uncharted territory. I can't imagine a better camera for these purposes: I don't even notice the weight! And it can take uncompressed TIFF images! The menus and controls are well-designed, fairly intuitive to use, and mostly unobtrusive.

Now if I could just find a good low-cost source for CompactFlash memory!

I am completely satisfied with this great product.<br><br>
