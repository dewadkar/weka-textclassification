            I bought my '97 Neon Sport in 1997 for $13,500.  A good deal for a sport since it stickered at $15,350.  It had 2500 miles on it because it was a dealership demo model.  Since I bought the car I have had some problems.  However, none of the problems I have had are inherent to my car alone and all of them had Technical Service Bulletins written about them.  The most significant repair it needed since purchased was a headgasket.  This is a prevalent problem on Dodge Neons, although Chrysler may try to disagree.  The repair was performed well after the warranty expired (at 60k miles) but after a call to Chrysler directly to complain, they fixed it for $150.00

The car is now 3.5 Years old, I have had other minor repairs, but not costly ones.  The car runs great, always starts and is solid.  No squeaks or rattle in the body hardware.  I do need new control arm bushings, another apparent commonality with older Neons.  This may be costly as well, couple of hundred dollars due to the labor involved, but again over the life of the car, this is not a lot.

I recommend this car to commuters and college students.  It's reliable and gets 32 MPG still today.  It got about 35 MPG when I purchased it.  A drop is normal as time goes by.  Remember, I got the sport and it seems to make a difference.  The low end models seem to be quirkier for some reason.  Lastly, this car is good under pressure.  I was hit in the rear by an elevator truck traveling at 40 MPH, the damage you would think would have been large.  It was not, it looked damaged but not severely smashed as you would think.  Repair estimates were about $3500.00 total.<br><br>
