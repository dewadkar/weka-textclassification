            My wife and I bought a 2001 Honda CR-V LX in November of 2001, trading in our 2000 Civic EX.  We figured that this would be a fantastic vehicle for us since we're both avid skiers/snowboarders, and also do plenty of camping and hiking.  Boy, were we wrong.

The CR-V had lots of room inside, and was quite comfortable, but the optional roof rack we discovered was $360 to be added by the dealer.  Additionally, there were no front mudflaps, which resulted in some <B>serious</B> damage to the body panels (read on).  At first blush, the CR-V was going to be great.....

We went skiing in the Oregon mountains with our CR-V about 6 times.  We washed it in between times up to the mountains, because the passes are quite filthy in the winter; the Dept. of Transportation uses ground up lava rock (which is plentiful here) to "sand" the roads for traction.  Well, when detailing our vehicle in May, after the season was over, we noticed that it looked like someone had <B>sand-blasted</B> our poor CR-V...all the way from the front fender to the rear in a 3" strip.  Additionally, the gray high-impact plastic that borders the bottom edge of the vehicle was chewed up <B>really</B> bad.  Needless to say, we were very upset.

I called Honda, and they said they'd never heard of this happening; but when looking at other CR-Vs around town, I noticed similar damage to those vehicles.  I believe this is because of the way the door panels curve under near the bottom; it naturally catches debris from this primarily front-wheel drive vehicle.  Front mud flaps may have solved the problem, but there's no way to be sure.  We took it to a body shop to get an estimate on what it would cost to have it repaired and I almost had a heart attack: $1200 to take off all 4 doors and repaint them to match the rest of the vehicle.  And that's not counting the plastic parts!!  Insurance, by the way, wouldn't cover it because it fell under "normal wear and tear".

If you're going to be just carting around the kids, grocery shopping, taking your dog to the vet or not planning on going anywhere near the mountains or dirt, then the CR-V is fine for you.  If you're an avid outdoorsy type (skier, snowboarder, etc), then I'd highly recommend a <B>different</B> vehicle....like a Jeep Wrangler, Nissan XTerra or Subaru Forester.  But leave the CR-V at home.
