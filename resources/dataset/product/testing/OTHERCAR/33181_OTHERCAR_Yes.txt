               According to my husband who drives this truck, those are his words.  He really does love everything about it.  It is a 1999 3500 C Series, Crew-Cab Dually.  He bought it a couple months ago at a great deal because the Chevrolet dealer was trying to get rid of the remaining 99's.
   
   Some of his favorite features of this truck are:
  
  * 6.5 Turbo Diesel engine.   It is strong enough to pull anything and everything yet doesn't gussel the gas.  He generally pulls his race cars.  There isn't any swaying because of the extra long wheel base.

  * Average gas mileage is 23 miles to the gallon. What other truck can have that kind of power and get that kind of mileage?

  * The interior is comfortable.  The driver's seat has power lumbar for support.  The seats are soft yet durable.  He had broken his back many years ago and has not been able to stand long drives since.  He doesn't feel any pain or pressure with these seats.

  * The 4 doors are an excellent plus to any pickup truck.  Especially if you have kids like we do.  The underneath of the back seat is great for storage such as tools.

  * The back seat is actually a full size.  Not just for kids like most, but comfortably seats adults as well.

  * The back seat fold up for more inside cargo room.

  * The controls are all easily accessable to the driver.  You can comfortably reach all radio controls(including the CD player) from the driver seat.  Our truck has power windows and locks as well.

  * There is no better comfort than safety!  This truck is so solid that you don't have a worry in the world about protecting your family inside of this truck.

  * The noise level is extremely quiet for a diesel.

  With our business, we have had many pick-up trucks.  We have also had many makes and models.  This is by far the best one yet. I would recommend it to anyone in the market for buying a new truck.    

*****SAFETY UPDATE*****

  My husband was driving this truck when he swerved to miss an animal in the road.  He was driving about 40 mph when he ended up crashing into a concrete barrier on the opposite side of the road.  The entire drivers' side was crushed, including the front fender, driver side door, and the wheel which was literally laying flat on the ground (over 10,000.00 worth of damage to the truck).  My husband and my mother(who was in the passenger side) walked away without a scratch or even a bruise.  I would have to say this is the worst crash I have ever seen without any injuries.  

  There has also been one minor alternator problem that was covered under warranty.
