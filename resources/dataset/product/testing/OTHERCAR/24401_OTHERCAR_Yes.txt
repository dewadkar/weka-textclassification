            NOTE:  It looks as if Epinions has my opinion on this truck categorized under the four-wheel drive model, but mine is a two-wheel drive (see below).

I bought a 1999 Frontier XE, 4 cylinder, manual transmission, King Cab 4x2 truck in May of 1999.  So far I have accumulated 4700 miles on it with no complaints.

This is my first truck.  I making a buying decision, my wife and I focused on reliability, economy, and usefulness.

The vehicles we shopped seriously were the Toyota Tacoma, the Nissan Frontier, and the Subaru Forester (a wagon, not a truck).  After comparing, we decided on the Nissan because it is well built, gets reasonable gas mileage for a truck (I'm getting about 25 mpg in the city, 28 mpg on the highway), and it is very affordable.  We liked the Toyota Tacoma a lot, and it is probably the most popular compact truck on the road, but we saved some significant dollars by choosing Nissan.  And we feel like we have just as much faith in the reliability of Nissan products.

When we started looking at compact trucks, we expected them to be like tin cans.  We figured most would be noisy and lightweight; this is not the case with the Frontier.  It is solid, quiet, and has a sure-footed feel on the road.  It also sits up higher and provides great visibility (even though my model isn't even a four wheel drive version).

I should also note that we had a great experience at the dealership; I have bought a total of four brand new cars in my life (all different dealers and manufacturers), and this was the FIRST time that we actually enjoyed the experience and felt like the dealer was reasonable and responsible.

Shoppers who want more power should test drive the V6 model Frontier.  The four cylinder has good power for basic transportation, but those who want some "get up and go" should look at the V6.  We enjoy the King Cab because of the extra room.  This is particularly handy when the weather is bad and you don't want stuff in the bed of the truck to get soaked.

We did pick a model which came with a bed liner from the factory...a wise investment for only $150.  We are using our truck to haul lots of hardware, lumber, etc. (we are remodeling a house), and the bed liner is great for saving on wear and tear.

That's about all I can think of to tell you.  Best wishes shopping and I hope you end up as pleased as I am with your compact truck.

UPDATE AS OF 1/26/01:  I must report that I sold my Nissan Frontier and bought a new 2001 Toyota Tundra, a full-size pickup truck.  In 12,000 miles of use, my Frontier was flawless and provided good, reliable transportation.  I simply wanted to upgrade to a larger truck with more equipment.  I was able to sell it to an individual through a newspaper ad.  I was able to sell it for a great price; it held its value very well.
