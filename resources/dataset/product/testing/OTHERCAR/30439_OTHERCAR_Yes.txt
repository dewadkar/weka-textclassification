               Back in 1992 I decided it was time to replace my husband's 11-year-old Toyota Celica, which had really gone the distance for us. I looked to Consumer Reports for a car that was both reliable and affordable. Armed with a list of five cars that were in my price range ($5,000 to $7,000), I went to my local dealership in Raleigh, NC. Not wanting to haggle with a salesman, I handed him the list and my phone number and asked him to call me when he had found me a car.

   I got a call a day or two later-he had found a 1988 (not the 1989 I had specified) Toyota Corolla with close to 50,000 miles on it.  He asked if I would consider it.  I decided I would, and bought the car the next day.

   I have not had one day go by that I have thought twice about that decision.  This car has exceeded my expectations.  I'm not very good about remembering to check the oil regularly, and I have not kept up with the maintenance at all like I should (hey!  I'm a busy girl!), yet this car is still running.  The mileage is now up to 240,000, and I know it will last at least another 20,000 or more.  It's small, but comfortable enough for four passengers, gets great gas mileage, and has been more than a reliable source of transportation. 

   It's comforting knowing that my Toyota will last.  I plan to buy another Corolla when mine retires.  Definitely buy.<br><br>
