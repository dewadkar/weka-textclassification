            I drive over 25,000 miles a year and my old 1990 Probe was just not cutting it anymore, It had 176,000 miles and was on the verge of falling apart. I decided that I needed a reliable car, but I did not want to pay for a new car and watch it quickly go down in value. After searching for the perfect car for a month or so I came across a 97 Mystique.

It had a V6 automatic, power everything, even a spoiler and nice wheels. I test drove it and fell in love, It had power and handled awesome, 100 times better than my wannabe sports car probe. Even better it had four doors and only cost me $65 a month to insure.

 Nothing else I found came close to the value of this car. For $12,000 I got a car with only 24,000 miles, a V6, automatic, cruise, air, even a CD player, and remote keyless entry. No other car came close. The only other types of cars that were comparable were the Taurus, because so many come back from leases, and the Dodge Avenger. I did not like the feel of the Taurus, I'm a college student and the car just seemed way to big. The Avenger with a V6 would have been nice, but it also would have cost alot more to insure and something I hate is paying more than I have to for insurance. I feel that I found the most car for the money in my Mystique<br><br>
