            Upon the advise of my mechanic, I checked out the Suzuki Esteem sedan. I had never heard of it before and was surprised to find it very pleasing to the eye -- much more so than the Chevy Metro and other comparable subcompacts. 

After researching the vehicle through the Kelley Blue Book website, I decided to take a chance on eBay. I found a really sharp Esteem offered out of Philadelphia and won the bidding for what I thought was a steal. Rather than ship the car to my home in California, I decided to fly to Pennsylvania and drive the car home. 

The car looked great -- nice, shiny paint and attractive styling for a small car. The interior was very adequate with more cloth details than the average "plastic everywhere" subcompact. The stereo is a good performer, and I was impressed by the legroom for a 6'3" person. The seats are reasonably comfortable compared to the typical subcompact rock-hard benches that make your lower body go numb after a couple of hours. The trunk is larger than I expected, too, and the fold-down rear seat is a bonus. The plastic cup holder is not durable enough, but I can live with that.

The engine is a very responsive 1.8 liter DOHC. A testament to Suzuki's desire for quality and value is that the engine has a timing chain rather than the typical belt.  I had several mountain ranges to cross, and the transmission has an overdrive override for just that purpose. When I hit the higher elevations, I pressed the button and the Esteem TOOK OFF. I accelerated to 75 mph and the coolant gauge needle never moved! Plus, I averaged 33-35 mpg for the entire trip. I was sold. When I got home, I averaged 30 mpg on my first several tanks. Sold even more.

It is a curiosity that this car is so obscure. I drove nearly 4000 miles and never saw another Esteem on the road. That doesn't bother me; I never liked being the 75th car of the same model in the parking lot anyway.

I am sorry that Suzuki discontinued this car in 2002, but I will check out its future product lines when I need another car. Finding a dealership can be a challenge, but I have one a half hour away if I really need it. I don't usually use the dealer for maintenance issues, but it's nice to know I can get parts if I need them.

So, if you're looking for a better than average used small car, check out the Esteem. You'll get it for far less money than the Honda or Toyota (or even Geo) counterparts, and you lose very little if anything that matters.
