            I LOVE my 1998 Nissan Quest.  Talking about a sporty little van.  This van is the best out there.  Small, but large enough to hold 7 people.  This van has everything.  I've previously had a Plymouth grand voyager.  After 2 years and 15 trips to the dealer for repairs.  I gave up on that lemon!  I will never buy an American made car again.  I've been to the dealer a total of 3 times in a 1 1/2 yrs.  Very minor things like the seatbelt was installed backwards and I had the CD player replaced. That was probably my fault I use it everyday (love my music) smile.  
     I have the GXE which is the top of the line. Its loaded with everything.  Sunroof, CD player, automatic seats, captains chairs, alarm (which is standard), auto lights, controls for radio,CD,cassette in rear for kids, air/heater controls in rear for passengers, and lots more.     You couldn't pay me to trade this van in for any other.  I just love everything about it.
  The only thing I miss is the second sliding door.  When I purchased my Plymouth Voyager it was the first van that they made the second sliding door on. It was real convenient for the passengers riding with you.
You would think I own stock in Nissan the way I am going on about it. I don't.  I am just a believer in the Nissan Quest.  If you want a great van and want the most for your money (who doesn't?)test drive this van.  Nissan will make a believer out of you too.  Happy van hunting!
