            I went looking for a pickup in December of 2001. I looked at all the small pickup models. (Tacoma,Frontier,Ranger in addition to the Sonoma) Ended up buying a GMC Sonoma Extended Cab. I've driven the truck as a commuter vehicle for the past two years and put 26K miles on it. Here's my take on the Sonoma:

OPTIONS ON THE VEHICLE UNDER REVIEW
Automatic, 4.3L V6, tilt, cruise, a/c, 3rd door, CD player, ABS

INTERIOR

This Sonoma has the 60/40 split bench seat with a fold down arm rest. Seating is comfortable, and there is a third seat belt in front. This allows my family to use this in a pinch since we need 4 seats. The Sonoma only has one jump-style side facing seat in the extended cab section. (Seat folds down from the side opposite that of the 3rd door. The 3rd door is on the drivers side.) So, three in front and one in back. This is fairly snug with our 11 and 13 year old girls. Strictly short trips for 4. 

The interior materials on the dash have a lot of hard plastic, which is not much of a concern for me, but I know some folks don't like. The dash, climate control, and stereo are slightly tilted in the direction of the driver. One of my complaints about this truck is the surprising amount of heat generated by the radio/CD player. Other than that, the stereo functions well enough, but all 4 speakers are in the front. 

The instrument cluster should be a model for all trucks. Gauges for engine temp, oil pressure, alternator voltage, tachometer, in addition to the speedometer. Lettering is white with orange highlights on black. Gauge needles are orange. This makes for easy reading day or night. 

RIDE AND HANDLING
This truck has the "heavy duty" suspension, which would imply a bouncy ride, right? Actually, the ride is pretty decent. Small bumps are smoothed out nicely. If a big pothole or other large bump is crossed, the ride will be more like a "heavy duty" truck. Handling is likewise pretty good for a truck. (My other truck experience is with Mazdas and Toyotas)

Braking is good but when braking suddenly, the truck needs little steering corrections. Not in one particular direction. Not a big problem but worth mentioning. 

HAULING CAPABILITIES
The bed is just longer than 6 feet, so the rear gate can be closed while hauling a 6 foot couch. Being a compact pickup, you can't lay a 4 by 8 foot sheet of plywood flat in the bed, due to the wheel wells in the bed. Well, unless you use the notches in the side of the bed to lay two 2"X6"s across the notches on either side of the bed. Then you can lay a sheet of plywood on top making a two-tier storage capability. There are 4 tiedowns in the 4 corners of the bed, as is typical for pickups. With the 4.3L in this Sonoma, towing capacity is listed as 6,000 pounds.

ENGINE AND PERFORMANCE
Engine starts nicely and accelerates very well. With all the torque available and as I don't often have the bed loaded, it's not hard to break the wheels free at lights or on on-ramps. After two years, I don't have to think about it anymore. I've adjusted.

I have read complaints about the engine noise for the Sonoma/S10s, but the engine noise is quieter than the 92' Mazda B2600 with a 4 cylinder. 

Gas mileage is a consistent 19 in mixed driving. I do have a soft tonneau cover, which adds about 1 MPG.

EXTERIOR
Pretty subjective, but I think its a nice looking truck. Not as aggressive looking as a PreRunner, but a little more truck looking than a Tacoma. Mine is a cherry red metallic with like colored bumpers and body side moldings.

WARNING ABOUT LANE CHANGES
My one significant gripe about this truck is the thick pillars between the front side windows and the rear quarter extended cab windows. This cuts the driver's side visibility enough to make lane changes a little more effort than they should be. It is less of a problem on the passenger side if the passenger seat can be reclined back.
