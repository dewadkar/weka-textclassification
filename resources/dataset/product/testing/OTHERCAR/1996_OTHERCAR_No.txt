            I leased on of the very first 2000 SE's after 3 wonderful years and 45,000+ miles on a '97.  This was the first time in my many years of motoring that I got the same car twice!

I just got back to the office after my 6th trip to the dealer's service department in 11 months.  Problems?  You bet.

Traction control (still not fixed), hesitation (still not fixed), water leaks (hopefully fixed . . .we'll see with the next rain), warped rotors (just replaced under warranty), &quot;service engine soon light&quot; that required replacement of a sensor in the gas tank.

I miss my '97 so much that I yearn for it every time I see one on the road.  Wish I'd kept it or opted for the Acura 3.2TL.  Had two and never had a problem.

Sometimes what seems like a value is not!<br><br>
