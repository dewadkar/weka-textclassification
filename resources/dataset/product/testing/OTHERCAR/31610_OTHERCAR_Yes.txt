            I cannot say enough about this great camera!  Cheers to Nikon for delivering everything it promises in this unit!

I wont list all of the features in this unit, but if you look on Nikon's web site, you can be assured that all of it's wonderful features work flawlessly as designed.

This camera cost me about $415 after the $75 Nikon rebate several months ago.  At that price, you will not find another camera that comes remotely close to this one's performance.

Photo quality is perfect--so crisp and clear you'd swear you were wearing 3D glasses.  Seriously, these photos jump off the screen at you.  Very nice.

One of most useful features for me is its ability to capture 40 frames in only a couple of seconds.  I spend tons of time at Laguna Seca Raceway.  Capturing series shots of cars and motorcycles at speed is never a problem with this camera.

There really is nothing to knock about this unit.  Typical of all electronic goodies, batteries do not last long.  I use NiMH rechargables that at least double my usage over standard alkaline batteries.  With two sets of freshly charged cells I am never without enough power to shoot an entire day.<br><br>
