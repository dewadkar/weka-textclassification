            With the arrival of our new son, wife and I were on the prowl for a larger vehicle.  We already own a Honda Civic, so clearly there was already a bias towards getting another Honda.  After alot of exploring of Subaru's, Mazda, and Ford, the Honda CRV still came out on top.

1. interior room:  although the exterior is somewhat boxy, it does lend itself to the incredible amount of interior cargo space that rivals the larger SUV's.  The rear seats fold flat creating a huge cargo area

2.  Standard equipment:  our EX had a/c, 6 CD changer, heated mirrors, power windows and locks, and remote keyless entry.  This provided more than a comfortable ride

3.  power.  while some may balk at the 160 HP 4 cylinder engine.  The better fuel economy more than makes up for any deficiences in a slower acceleration.  Mind you we are not ones to tow anything, so it worked well for us.  Clearly one would need a V6 for serious towing capacity.

4. reliability:  my civic is over 10 years old, and still purrs.  I will take it on a long road trip and trust it.  I will pay for that security of mind.

5.  ease of driving.  It is strong enough to get up to the ski hills that we venture on, yet small enough to easily park in the city.  I have only felt the rear wheels engage in 4WD mode once.  But at least it is there.
