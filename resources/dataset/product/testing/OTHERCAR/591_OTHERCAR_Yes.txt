            Lexus RX300

They�ve Gone Bananas!

At the same time I went looking at the LX470, I was also introduced to the Lexus RX300. As for its bigger brother, the workmanship is excellent and the material used is all of superior quality. 

When I asked the price, I was really surprised to hear that it was $5,000.00 less expensive than the LX470.

For the 470, I believe that even if it was too pricey for me, it still had an excellent value to price ratio. For the RS300 I am not convinced of that.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Lexus RX300 is a want to be SUV; the one I test drove was not even 4-wheel drive. The sales representative told me it was manufactured mostly for the urbanites that must have at any cost a SUV parked in their driveway next to
their Beamer.

Instead of having a traditional 4-wheel drive assembly, it has a viscous-coupling center differential and transfer case integrated into the transmission. 

What this does is that during normal usage the torque is divided equally between the front and rear wheels. But when extra power is needed either in the front or rear then the viscous center coupler transfer the power to the wheel that has more grip and pulls the RX300 out of the jam.

It sounds real good but I am not certain that I would trust this system off-road.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The inside of the RX300 is very nice, as for the LX470; I did not see any flaws or any thing that did not seem too questionable.

The RX I test drove did not have leather seats, they are an option. I felt that at the price they sell the RX300 leather seats should be a standard item. 

In the front there is sufficient leg and headroom in the rear the headroom is excellent but the legroom is a little tight.

Also the cargo volume is a little restricted, with only 39.8 cubic feet of volume. I believe that for a SUV there should more cargo space since many people use this type of vehicle to carry their equipment.

All the gauges and controls where within an easy reach of the driver.

The safety aspects are excellent; the RX300 is equipped with driver, passenger and side airbags.

The all around vision from the driver�s position is excellent also, but I would have prefer bigger side mirrors since at times people use their SUV to pull a trailer.

The exterior:

The exterior body of RX300 looks good and aside from the flaw I mentioned above about the smaller side view mirrors I could not see any else wrong with it.

The paint job is of superior quality and the selection pf alloy wheel is an excellent match for this vehicle.

THE ROAD TEST

I did not have a chance to drive the RX300 too far. I had already made up my mind that I was not going to purchase this vehicle.

I drove it a little around town and it handled very well, then I went on a beltway and again I could find nothing wrong with the way it handled.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The RX300 I test drove was equipped as follows:

Engine: A V-6, 3-liters motor that developing 220 horsepower.
Transmission: 4-speed automatic.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc with ABS
Tires: 225/70R16 mounted on alloy wheels.


PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The RX300 is an excellent vehicle, but it is too expensive for my budget.  

I enjoyed driving it, it handled real well. If I would win a lottery, I would opt for the LX470 instead it is only $5,000.00 and change more than the RX300
