            I bought the Rav4 expecting a great SUV.  I was sorely disappointed with this car.  I would recommend the modern Rav4s, but do <i>not<i> buy this model. I have numerous problems with the car.  When I am driving on the highway, it sounds as if one of the doors is not shut completely, though all of them are.  This makes listening to music or talking on the phone difficult on the highway, when both are the most desired.  I, personally, cannot stand the V4 model that I got, since I have yet to find another car with such horrible acceleration, even <i>with<i> the ect. power turned on.  The compact design of the car, though nice when looking for parking or trying to U turn somewhere, is a disadvantage since the gas tank is quite small for the size.  The fuel gage is horribly inaccurate.  I've ran out of gas several times because the "midway" point is not actually midway, but more like 2/3 of the way towards empty.  The light size of this car makes it very difficult to handle in wind, and very dangerous on steep roads or severe curves.  

All in all, I would warn anyone before buying this car to look for other options.  I am sure that there are numerous other cars better, and safer, than this one.
