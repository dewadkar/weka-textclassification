            REVISED 7/03:  Now fully compatible with Mac OS X, including Apple iPhoto and Image Capture.  Canon has also provided a Mac version of the RAW Image Management software.  This model has largely been replaced by the essentially similar S45, with better battery management, movie mode and auto-focus capabilities, but this model is still a deal if you can find one.  The newer (black) S50 is a 5 megapixel version of this camera with some improvements

OK, first off, I LOVE this camera.  It is small enough to carry regularly, easy enough to use in "full auto" mode to shoot snapshots under any conditions, and powerful and flexible enough to allow my inner artist all the creative control and multiple settings he could ever hope for.   It can even shoot 20 or 30 second mini-movies with sound (MPEG files) and lets you annotate your pics with a voice note to recall where they were taken.

The camera takes (potentially) HUGE detailed images, allowing plenty of room for high-resolution zooming and cropping without losing detail or quality.  Full auto, shutter and aperture-priority, portrait, landscape and macro modes provide intelligent default settings, with full customizability IF you want it.  You can also just set it on "Auto" and use it like a super-high resolution point and shoot snapper as well.  Take care to set your resulting image size small enough to email easily or use on a website if you intend that use.  You may never buy another camera.

A few caveats: 
1. Buy an extra battery (third-party ones are cheaper than Canon's and last longer--check the web) and shoot with the viewfinder rather than the LCD when you can and you will save battery life, which is really not too bad.  
2. The Canon AC adapter is expensive AND stupidly designed (requires removing the battery so you can't charge while using it)--a spare is a better idea.  
3. Be careful with the sliding lens cover--it can be pried upward when sliding it into a case and get off its rails.  (Don't use Canon's case either--too small, too expensive)  I use a generic nylon cell phone/digicam case for $9.99
4. Buy a much bigger CompactFlash card--16 MB is way too small for a camera that can make 4 MB pictures.  I recommend shopping around for a 128 MB at least ($50, or get a 256mb for $95)
5. They should have recessed the LCD--it scratches easily.
6. I bought mine on the web with full US warranty for 45% off the $899 list.  I cannot imagine how ANY retail store sells this camera or Canon's overpriced accessories ever.
