            I bought this car used with 52000 miles in 1997, and it now has 157000 miles.  The QUAD-4 motor is still running as reliably as the day I bought it, and I have not had any problems which kept me stranded or made the car undrivable.  However, there are some big downsides I have found with this car.  First, it is nearly impossible to work on for the do it yourself mechanic such as myself.  The engine is very unfriendly to wrench on, and the transmission is even worse!!!  It is absolutely rediculous!  It is a sealed transmission, so it does not have a dipstick and thus you can't check the fluid.  I have been told that you are supposed to just take it to the dealership and they can do it, but it'll cost ya, obviously.  Find a ma and pa transmission shop you can trust and you'll save a few hundred bucks.

The only servicing I have done to this car is 2 sets of motor and trans mounts (a big pain to change yourself), serpentine belt, and regular preventative maintenance.  The power windows quit working 6 months ago and I still can't figure out why (go down but not up).  There are a lot of rattles, mainly from the dash and from the rear strut mounts which seam to wear out all too quickly in these cars.  It goes through brakes very fast, almost as fast as motor mounts.

Despite the rattles and the mysterious things that go wrong, you can't kill the quad 4.  I am not easy on cars, and this car has taken everything I have thrown at it.<br><br>
