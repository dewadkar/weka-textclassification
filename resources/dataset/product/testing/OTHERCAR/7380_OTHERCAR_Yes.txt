            My sixteen-year old boy started to drive and I have decided to let him drive the family Land Rover Discovery.  Since my eighteen-year old son was driving the Discovery, we need to find him another car. He goes to the mountain and snowboard from time to time. The Discovery is great for going up to the slope but it only does about 12 miles per gallon.  With premium gas at close to $1.80 a gallon, it is time to get something with better fuel economy.

The boy wanted a truck, as it would enable him to haul his snowboard and stuff.  He wanted a Toyota Tundra but changed his mind for a smaller Tacoma (the fuel issue).  I am not too sure about how good a pickup would do in the snow, as most of the weight is not at the driving wheels (on a rear wheel drive).  He does not want a 4-wheel drive due to the fuel issue.  I was looking for a smaller SUV for him but after driving the Land Rover, he wanted something other than another SUV or a station wagon.  An Audi A4 would be great for the slopes but it would be too expensive a car for an eighteen-year old.  We had a Turbo Audi long time ago and it was a very good car but without any resale value.  

After reading about Subaru Impreza WRX in car magazines, I thought the Impreza would be great for him.  The WRX would be too much car for him but the 2.5RS might be prefect.  As it turned out the 2.5RS is indeed prefect for him. 

Initial Impression 
The side profile was nothing to rave about but I like the flared fenders.  The back of the car is rather nondescript but the front looks cute with those huge fog lights.  The car passes the opening and closing door test with a reassuring clunk.  The trunk is of good size and with a pass through in the middle at the armrest.  The paint job was decent.  The 5 spoke wheels look fine and should be easy to clean.  The front seat is comfortable and height adjustable.  This car feels roomy despite being a small car due to the high roofline. The seats are covered with a combination of fabric and vinyl. It looks good and seems to be of good quality material.  The back seat is comfortable, knee and foot space are not bad and I can sit in it with no problem (I am almost 6 feet tall).  The leather steering wheel has a nice feel but can be only adjusted for tilt not reach.  The gearshift and most controls are readily at hand.  The instrumentations on the dash are rather basic. The air condition works well but the standard stereo sounds cheap (my son put in his own stereo equipment after he got the car).

The Drive
The ride is as good as if not better than my wifeï¿½s BMW 328.  The car corners flat with hardly any roll.  The brakes feel good and stops short if needed to be.  The steering is about as good as it comes, with the right amount of feel, feedback and weight.  The engine settled at a 700 rpm idle and is very smooth, vibrations is minimal for a 4 cylinder.  The acceleration is good and I can keep up with traffic without any problem.  The 5-speed gearbox shift nicely and the ratios seems to be fairly close.  It would climb a grade in high gear without down shifting.  I think the car can pull another gear as I was looking for another gear to shift up while I am already in 5th.  This car has good torque.  The car feels solid with no rattles on the road.  While the corning limit is not high, I can hold a 4-wheel drift easily.  It is very controllable.  This is one car that does not out drive your abilities.

Reliability
Consumer Report rated Subaru highly on its Reliability and they are right.  I drove it for the first thousand miles to break it in (I was having too much fun with it and did not want to let it go).  My son had since put in over 20,000 miles on it.  There is no problem to report.  

I paid $19,500.00 excluding taxes and license for a Platinum Silver Metallic RS2.5 4 door sedan with Fog Lamps, Keyless Entry System, Air Filtration system, Rear Spoiler and a tweeter kit. This is one good little car with All Wheel Drive. In my opinion, the All Wheel Drive and the good engine torque are prefect combination on this car to go to the slopes.  I highly recommend it.
