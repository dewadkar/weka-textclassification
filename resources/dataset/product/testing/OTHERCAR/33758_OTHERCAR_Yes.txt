            This car is the best I've had so far. Previously driver of VW Polo and Golf (but Alfista in the heart as I learned to drive in an '84 Alfetta 2.0) I am delighted at the pleasure of driving this car. The engine is a Diesel (direct injection Turbo) I know, it makes it less an Alfa, but it also makes me imagine that the gas-powered engine version must be absolutely perfect. 
I received this car in December 2000, it's a Burgundy red Sportwagon model, so the back of the car is different than the regular 156(see http://www.alfasportwagon.com for pictures) but the designers managed to keep the splendid design of the 156. 
The stability and handling of the car is excellent, also in sharp turns and narrow urban situations like the ones I experience daily. I have chosen the rear Nivomat suspensions as an option and it makes an impressive difference on long highway trips with 3 adult passengers and luggage. The car drives like it was empty. 
The diesel engine delivers enough power for a honest but nervous usage. Those who want the extra power to feel like they're driving a petrol engine might chose the 2.4 JTD. Comparing with the VW 110HP engine, the Alfa Romeo one is an older design and slightly less powerful, but certainly more flexible. Alfa Romeo recently announced new JTD engines with very high HP delivery.
At first I was a bit afraid of the quality of the assembly and of the accessories, an traditional curse for Italian cars. To date I have had no problems at all. Everything is perfectly built and assembled, nothing is out of place or came out of it. The only thing that happened to me is that I broke the rear sliding cover that hides the contents of the trunk. It was my fault but it was quite fragile. It was replaced at no cost by Alfa as they had many cases like mine, and I received a new, stronger model of that accessory. This takes me to the quality of the service. Though I have heard in the Alfa newsgroup that this is not at all good in the UK and some other cases, I have been delighted by the help of the Alfa people. They patiently answered all questions and took the time to discuss all matters with me. At the delivery I felt like I was given something more than an object. Unlike the yawnmobile cars I drove before, this one is "alive". It responds to passion.
Its price for the dimensions of an average family car is low. I would recommend it to anyone looking for both active and safe driving.
