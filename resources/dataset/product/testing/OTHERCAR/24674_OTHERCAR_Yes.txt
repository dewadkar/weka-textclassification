            My husband and I purchased a Chevy Venture in 1997.  97 was the first year of the Venture and my husband was very leary about buying a first year model, but, I won out!  We drove practically every MiniVan on the road that year and none compaired to the Venture!  It's very comfortable, especially if you have children, quite and smooth ride of all we tried.
We decided not to get the sunroof because when you rode with the sunroof open it was very noisey.  The driver side sliding door is a God Send, as is the automatic sliding door on the passenger side.  The seats are wonderful, you can have any combination of seating in the back including the intergrated child seat.  Rear air is a must, the only problem with this that we've found is by the summer of '99, the rear air apparently ran out of Freon, it needs to be serviced.  The front air is fine though. I do wish we would've gotten the power rear windows, we didn't think we would need them, but, it would be nice!  We are a little dissatisfied with the breaks of the Chevrolet, they have squealed since 1 week after we bought the van, the dealership told us this is just what most heavy Chevy vehicles do. Update on the breaks:  at 49400 miles, the rear wheel cylinder on both rear breaks have gone out.  We took it to the Chevrolet Dealership and spoke with customer service and they told us this is NORMAL for the REAR WHEEL CYLINDERS TO GO OUT ABOUT 40000 MILES.  This was rather disturbing considering most wheel cylinders last a good 80000 miles or more.  Of course they refused to fix at their expense saying this is no defect.  But, I will always refer a Chevy Venture over any other Mini Van on the street!  I don't find any reason not to buy a Venture!<br><br>
