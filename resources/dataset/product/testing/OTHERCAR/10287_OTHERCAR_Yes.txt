            We have had a Nissan Sentra for the past two years.  It is our work car so we drive countless of miles on it.  We even drive this car through a shallow creek every day.  Yet it is still working as well as the day we bought it.  Besides a flat tire and oil changes this car has been a delight to own.  This car has good handling and our 4 valve version of the car has the most power I have ever seen with that small of an engine.  So if you are interested in a reliable car go with the Nissan Sentra.<br><br>
