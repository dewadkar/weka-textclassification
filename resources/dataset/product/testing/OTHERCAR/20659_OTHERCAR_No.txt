            I bought this car partly based on the maintenance agreement that was included in the purchase price of the car. Audi claimed that they would repair any defective parts for the first three years. What a joke! Within a week of the purchase, I noted that the gas gauge did not function at all and that a warning light flashed. When I took it back to the dealer he already knew about the problem. It is now FOUR months later and still no parts or resolve. When I contacted Audi of America they were even less sympathetic than the dealer. They could not even give me an estimate of when the problem would be fixed. Aren't these the same folks who the lemon law was created for? No lemonade here, only rotten customer service.   

I have talked with other Audi owners who have expressed similar problems with the service. Unlike most major manufacturers, I get the feeling that they really don't care. I previously owned two Jaguars, and there is a company that looks at customer service as an opportunity to show how good they are(and they are good).

Other problems include a clunky transmission (at low speeds)and an air bag indicator light that never goes off. The radio also drifts from station to station. Not quite what you would expect from a quality new car.

On a positive side, it does handle well, especially on the road. The turbo has enough power to get up and go. <br><br>
