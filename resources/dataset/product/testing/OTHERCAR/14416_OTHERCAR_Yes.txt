            rev 2.0


Being a 30-something dot-com degenerate going on 17, I'm pretty certain the M45 is not a car you're likely to see becoming a hit with the young, hip, urban crowd.  However, also being a 30-something old-fart computer geek with frayed nerves, eccentric tastes, and a lead foot, this car hit the mark much like my much-missed '99 GS400.  Unfortunately, my demographic is not a popular one.<br>

The M's looks will appeal to a more conservative buyer; unfortunately, its not-so-plush suspension, complicated, unintuitive controls, and zoomy throttle response will subsequently deter them.  The buyers who might be sold by the test drive will barely glance at this stodgy sedan; those who favour the styling aren't inclined to compete in  a stoplight grand prix. <br>

It's styling suggests "Crown Vic" at first glance:  With ominous yet nondescript grill, wide conventional-looking headlights,  and formal sedan profile(offset somewhat by the optional rear spoiler), this car with ponderous dimensions will quickly be dubbed "the boat".  It also appears to only look good in grey and black.    Stick with the base wood trim, as the yellowish maple extra-option bits just don't suit either interior colour. Despite my naval references, however, there's some performance equipment hiding under this land-yacht's rigging, much like a hydrofoil's, which lets it get up and boogie with the sporty speedboat crew, without punishing driver or passengers with a harsh ride.  <br>

There are a group of drivers who like their cars fast off the line, but slow on the notice.  These drivers buy cars like the Impala SS, the GS430, the CL/TL Type-S, the Marauder, the M5... and then promptly detune their looks approaching that of their slower brethen.  For those drivers, the M45 offers up an unbeatable price/luxury/performance package, that won't get you a second look from the local constabulary.  <br>

You might note the cars I mention above are also pretty big.  At 6'2", most of that being legs, many smaller cars don't fit me quite right.  Depending on the layout, many larger cars don't work either.  The M45 would be one of the anomolies: it's drivers seat and legroom is more cramped than I expected for a car this size.  However, its automatic seat and steering wheel adjustment option lets me extract myself without drama.  I'd initially turned those features off, but quickly turned them back on after a few entry/exits.  Once into my preferred driving position, all is comfy, suitable for long trips.  I've not been asked by a rear-seat passenger to 'scoot up' yet, and I've only let myself be chauffeured back there once; no complaints as of yet.  The cooled seats are a first for me; it's too bad they don't instantly cool down scalding-hot seating surfaces; it takes up to a minute for cold air to begin flowing.  At the coldest setting, it's easy to tell, by the expression on your happless passenger's face, when the cold air begins to circulate.  By far, short of ejection seats, it's one of the most mischevious options to activate on someone unawares.  It's a good thing that "riding shotgun" is figurative. ;)
<br>

Ignoring style, which often happens anyhow, there's a lot to like about this car.  You'll never forget a single one of its 3800-plus pounds, but its sophisticated suspension stays buttoned down in the twistys.  Its steering is precise as I've seen on this type of vehicle, and it doesn't lose composure when it encounters bumps mid-curve.  While one wouldn't expect it to keep up with its more nimble sibling G35 on some of the small winding coastal roads found around Northern California, you could expect not to be banged around and annoyed by the end of a brisk jaunt either.  Driven more leisurely, on reasonably maintained roads, the ride quality is smooth, controlled, and firm, without being harsh or abusive.  Its low profile sidewall tires do transmit any road irregularities back into the cabin, but not so much so that you'll regret not shelling out the extra few grand for the Q's adjustable suspension.  The car allows the right amount of road/mechanical noise in so you can hear what the engine and tires are up to, but not so much that the noise-adaptive Bose audio system cranks itself up to 'Max Volume' each time you get on the freeway. <br>

Having taken off the plastic engine cover, such that it may be as shiny and grease-free when I trade as when it was new, a view of the source of all the fun is to be had.  The 4.5L engine, not meant to be seen naked, has wiring, hoses, and brackets  placed in ways that are not altogether pleasing to the eye.  However, no obvious trouble spots were concealed by the gigantic plastic shroud.<br>

The exhaust system on the M45 seems to be identical to the Q's active backpressure setup.  Unlike many dual-exhaust 'poseurs', this car follows its sleeper-car mission here too:  Though it only has one muffler with dual chrome tailpipes, its plumbing is mostly dual from the engine back.  The two sets of pipes join briefly  for practical reasons, as the active exhaust appears to keep one pipe closed near the muffler to improve torque under normal driving conditions.  When the engine revs up, the damper opens giving a turbo-eqsque undertone to its already pleasant exhaust note.<br>

Another casualty of this nicheless beast:  It's vehicle dynamic control system appears to be set to a much more conservative driver.  While I appreciate ditch-avoidance assistance, especially when first exploring the limits of a shiny, new, expensive car, there have been times when the computer has asserted its good intentions a bit too feverently.  One example:  While making a right-on-red merge into brisk traffic, I found myself without any torque after the rear wheels spun the slightest bit on a crevice while leaving the intersection.  The VDC, believing that the small pothole was a sure sign of an imminent fishtail, effectively shut down 339 horses, leaving me creeping into 40 mph traffic for a bit longer than was comfortable.  If you've ever had a carburated vehicle with mechanical secondaries stall under too much throttle at low speeds, you know exactly what  it feels like.  Hopefully, the VDC has an adaptive mode and in time, it will learn when and when not to lighten my lead foot on my behalf.  In comparison to 5 other vehicles I've had with traction control (11 in total), the M's would be by far the most intrusive.  The G35s (coupe and sedan) I've had the opportunity to drive do not display this behavior.<br>

A few other niggling points:   Amber warning lights on an amber instrument panel?   If it weren't for the LCD display that follows up with any dashlight warnings, I'd be willing to bet you'd drive quite awhile before noticing the Check Engine light on.  However,  your eye will dart to the bright, ill-formed 'D' constantly, for fear you've annoyed your ride somehow.  And finally, how much could it possibly cost to have someone with a reasonable grasp of current english grammar proofread the Owner's Manual?  From Section 4-3, Reference Symbols  <b>"ENTER" button --  This is a button found on the control panel.</b>  --Accuracy 1, Utility 0.  The voice command system could use a broader range of functions.  The G35's four windows are fully automatic; why can't the M's be too?<br>

Fit and finish are top-notch; all controls are solid, smooth, if a bit out of place (Dash A/C temp is where left-hand-drive folks would expect to find audio volume), and the audio system quite nice for stock.  A coin holder would be appreciated, as would a single-CD dash player rather than a Tape deck.  I suspect the clearance between the transmission shifter and dashboard was the major reason for not having one.  Suggestion:  let the panel with the analogue clock swivel up for additional audio goodies.<br>

Oh, when the low-fuel light comes on, followed by the LCD warning, it's not kidding.   Fortunately, I had two able-bodied pals in the car to push it to the gas station.<br>
