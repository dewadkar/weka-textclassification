            i have this truck for one year, and it is the most reliable and greatest truck that i have ever known.  in my time with this car, i have driven it in all conditions.  it was sure-footed in the icy and cold weather in taos, and was easy to control when toeing my boat.  even in the +100 degree weather here in texas, the engine has never once overheated or broken down.  the chassis and suspension have held up during my several offroading experiences.  there have been only three problems with this truck.  the rear window seal had not been properly installed, creating extra road noise and allowing water to leak in.  the second is that it is a tremendous gas-guzzler.  the mileage can be expected to be under 15 mpg.  the other problem, which is to be expected on a truck, is that the rear seat is not the most comfortable thing in the world to ride on for long trips.  however, the front seats are great.  the truck is very responsive, even when lugging huge loads.  all in all, this is a great truck.<br><br>
