            Why am I proud of my 1999 Ram 2500 diesel! 
It makes me proud when I know I have a truck that is one of the most powerful ones on the road today. It makes me proud when I pull up to a red light and all you can hear is my Cummins engine, even over car stereos. I am proud when I pull into the lumber yard and they throw 30 sheets of 3/4 inch plywood in the back of this baby and you can hardly tell it.
It makes me proud when I can haul 2 yards of dirt or any other raw material in the bed of my truck and its not a strain to get going. It makes me proud when I pull into the gas station and fill up with 25 gallons of fuel and know I can drive on this for 550 miles. 
I am really proud when I can pull a Ford or Chevy heavy truck out of the ditch or sand. When I pull my 10,000 lb camper and pass Fords and Chevys when climbing a steep grade, I am very proud. I am assured in the fact that my engine has a 100,000 mile, ten year warranty on it.
I'm proud in the fact that I have had this baby a year and never had it I the shop. I can change my own oil every 7500 miles, and its easy. It makes me proud when I pull into a truck stop and have to use the big rig fuel stations. 
But, most of all, I am proud when Ford and Chevy owners tell me they should have got a Dodge Ram Diesel!
