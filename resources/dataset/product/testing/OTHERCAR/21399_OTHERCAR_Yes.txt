            Have been enjoying the Camry for a few years now, finally convinced my wife to give up on GM made products. This car has had no engine problems heading into 150,000 range. Only problem was glove compartment made a little rattle but took in and they fixed within a few hours.
 Be sure to check the prices online and even see if your dealership sells on line and write down the prices and he dealership will more than match what you find. Thought Nissan made the best car but now am a Toy buyer from now on. Would love to tell you what I dislike about this vehicle but have yet to find anything.
If you wonder about the miles my wife is into real estate and we take about 4 vacations a year.<br><br>
