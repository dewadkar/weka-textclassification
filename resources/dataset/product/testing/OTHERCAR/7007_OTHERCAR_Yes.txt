            This opinion is appearing under the 2000 TLC because there is not a category for the 2001.

I purchased a 2001 TLC about three weeks ago after considering it and the 2001 Sequoia.  This review focuses on the basis of my decision to purchase the TLC and not the Sequoia.  As an initial matter both are great SUV's and are worthy purchases.  But neither is perfect.  There is in fact a glaring problem with the 2001 TLC that was not present in the otherwise nearly identical 2000 TLC: the Stereo!

For 2001, the folks at Toyota decided to up the wattage from 170 to 300.  Unfortunately, they also added a feature to boost the bass when the engine is running.  They over did it, making the stereo completely unacceptable at lower volumes when playing tracks having a significant amount of bass. So much bass in fact that it is difficult to even listen to the stereo, even when the bass level is completely turned down. So beware, and test the stereo before buying.  Hopefully, the problem will be fixed within the next month or so.

Now on to the comparison between the TLC and the Sequoia.

#1) Features � The TLC and limited Sequoia are each extremely well equipped luxury SUV�s.  Most of the features found on the TLC are found on the Sequoia.  It is easier to describe the limited numbers of differences between a fully loaded limited Sequoia and a TLC.  The TLC is full time 4WD; the Sequoia has a 2wd mode. The TLC has driver and front passenger seats that have more adjustments than the Sequoia.   The TLC has a locking center differential, the Sequoia does not.  The Sequoia has a retractable rear window, the TLC does not.  The Sequoia has the homelink system, the TLC does not. That about it for the differences, although there are others, they are relatively minor.

#2) Other Differences � The TLC has a noticeably smoother ride, not that the ride of the Sequoia is rough, actually, it is very good for a truck.  The TLC is smaller, much smaller: you decide whether this is a benefit or a detractor. The TLC promises to be more capable off-road.  The TLC seats are more comfortable.  The TLC is more refined.  The TLC is quieter, although the Sequoia is not loud by any means.  The TLC is actually heavier than the much bigger Sequoia; this translates into a more solid and substantial feel.  The transmission in the TLC is smoother.  And then there is the final significant difference: the TLC is a land cruiser; it has the name and the reputation.  

#3) The engine, both list the 4.7 liter V8, but the Sequoia produces 240hp v. 230hp.  Is there a difference: maybe, maybe not: Toyota lists the 2000 TLC as developing 240 hp when equipped with California emissions.  My suspicion is that Toyota just spec�d the California engine nationwide on the Sequoia accounting for the 10hp difference.  So a 50-state emissions ready TLC should have the same HP as the Sequoia.

Making the Choice:  

A)	If you have a lot of people to haul, then it is the Sequoia; otherwise, the TLC will do. For me the size thing actually weighed quite heavily.  My wife thought the Sequoia was too big (I might add I have no kids). Further, I enjoy 4-wheeling and the added wheelbase of the Sequoia is a major detriment, significantly reducing the approach/departure angles. Will I actually do some hardcore 4-wheeling of the type a did in my previous ride, a 84 Grand Wagoneer? Probably not, at least for the first few years, but I like to think I can if a really want to.

B)	If money is an object, then the Sequoia it is. The TLC I purchased had a 58k+ MSRP, the fully equipped Sequoia LTD top out at under 46k and that includes side air bags that are not available in the TLC.  Now, the reality is the price difference is not that great in the real world.  I paid 53.5k for my TLC, a full 5k below the MSRP.  In other words, on this vehicle it pays to deal.  I suspect if I had more time to spend, I could have got the TLC for a little less.  Also truth be told, I had to purchase some opinions I would have passed on, like the wood trim (Definitely not worth $500+), the hood guard, the sunroof guard, and the wheel locks.  Actually, I wrote a deal with one dealer for 52.65k for a TLC with the third row of seats, and the convenience package (trailer hitch, running boards, rear wind deflector).  The Sequoia on the other hand is a hot truck and I the one dealer told me he could the most he could discount was $500.  

-	A comment on the wood dash:  I wanted a wood dash; I just did not want to pay for one.  If I were able to get one without the dash, I would have purchased a wood dash kit online that is applied over the plastic dash.  A complete kit of over 30 pieces costs under $400 dollars and is a good value when compared to the $500 plus for the factory fewer than 10 pcs. (www.exoticwooddashes.com).  While I am discussing dashes, I absolutely hate brushed metal dash of the Sequoia, what were they thinking, its downright UGLY.  There will probably be a wood dash kit for it soon as well.

A comment about the 3rd seat option: It is not really worth it! But almost no TLCs are brought into the country without it.  IF you want a TLC and have some time, order one without the 3rd seat and save over 2k, you will however wait a long time for your car.

Pricing: check with autotrader.com and carsdirect.com for pricing and use this pricing to drive your negotiations. I bought my TLC from a no haggle dealer at a price roughly 4k below their best �no haggle� price. You see, what they do not tell you is that, although they will not haggle, but they will accept deals obtained by haggling with other dealers.  In other words, haggling can save a lot of money.

C)	If image is everything, buy a land cruiser. If you are concerned about buying a car in its first model year, buy a TLC, although I do not think that is a valid reason, at least when dealing with Toyota.

Finally, there is no right or wrong decision with regard to either of these vehicles, just personal choice.  BEWARE, however, of the stereo problem (some have told me it exists on the Sequoia, I don�t know) on the 2001 TLC.  Get an assurance that it will be fixed or the dealer will discount the price to account for the unresolved problem.  Get the assurance in writing, verbal assurances from car dealers aren�t worth much, they will say anything to make a sale.  You will quickly find out their true colors when you ask them to reduce their statements into writing.
