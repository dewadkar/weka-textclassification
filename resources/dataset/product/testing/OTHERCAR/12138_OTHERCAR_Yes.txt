            The 1993 Prelude VTEC is a good car.  It has 190 horses.  Those horses can really make you fly.  Once the VTEC kicks in, you get slammed back into your seat.  The car has a nice ride.  I found the seats very comfortable, and controls easy to use.  They styling is very different from other 1993 cars.  The dash board is very interesting.  The gauges go all the way across to the passenger's side.  I do not like this at all.  I think it has a very cheap look.  Also, rear seat space is very minimal.  It is almost impossible to sit back there.  If you are looking for performance only, this is the car for you.  If you want something with a comfortable and appealing to the eye interior, look else where.<br><br>
