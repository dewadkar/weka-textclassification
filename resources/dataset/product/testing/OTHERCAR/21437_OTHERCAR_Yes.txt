            Let's begin with what I hate about my Stanza.  It looks bad.  No one will ever call your car a head-turner.  Don't get me wrong, the same is true for most cars, but if I had a say in the matter, the archaic box design doesn't appeal to me very much.   What else do I hate?  I'm a smoker, I smoke close to a pack a day.  The ash tray is located quite inconveniently behind the gear shift.  To simply line up your cigarette with the ashtray without knocking the flaming hot 'cherry' out onto the highly flammable upholstery is a task that requires far too much thought at 65 miles per hour.  To make matters worse, unless the gear shift is in a gear <I>other</I> than Park, the ash tray is nearly impossible to remove.  The cup holders also are pieces of garbage, forcing you to either keep your drinks in your lap or not have a center console.  OK, I'm being superficial, these are silly design flaws.  But there isn't much that I dislike about my car.

Sure, it takes a few minutes to warm up in the morning.  Sure, sometimes I have to shift it into Neutral to start it.  And finally, sure, my windshield cleaner fluid is leaking onto something and burning (which generates an occasional awful smell).

When you buy a car with an odometer reading as high as mine (187,500 going strong), you're going to take into account that it will have a few minor problems.  Most cars don't even make it to this point, and I'm anticipating that this car can make it far past 200,000, knock on wood.

This car is on it's third engine, after one rebuild and one replacement.  It's true, it probably won't survive another, but the way it's running now, it won't need it for a long time!

Let's take a quick 'test drive':

Initial start up it generally quick and relatively quiet.  My car doesn't vibrate or shake much unless it's extremely cold (which, unfortunately, it often is in NY), and even then it will only last for a few minutes until the engine warms up.  In cold conditions, like any car, acceleration will be stunted considerably.  Under normal circumstances, however, this car has excellent acceleration capabilities.  One giant factor that many other Nissan owners don't understand is the transmission switch located near the emergency brake.  Depending on the setting on this switch, this car will either roll to a comfy cruising speed or fly like a bat out hell.  This is extremely useful, especially in situations like being forced to yield (ie, cut off already moving traffic) on Palisades Interstate Parkway onramps.  Compared to other cars that I've taken on the highway, I particularly like this one for many reasons.  The cruise control is conveniently located on the wheel, eliminating the set-and-flick confusion that I know that I've suffered behind the wheel of other cars.  In addition, the instrumentation is very understandable, and very well laid out.  Warning lights are easy to understand, and are generally accurate (My 1990 Chevy Lumina, on the other hand, told me that I was overheating 90% of the time), and they are placed in a location that makes it easy for them to grab your attention (Again, Lumina owners can sympathize).  Moving along...  The first time I drove this car, I was a little bit shocked at the efficiency of the brakes.  I suppose that it's a combination of it's relatively light weight and fairly small size that allows it to stop so quickly.  So far I haven't had any incidents that made me skid with this car, although if this car responds better than my Lumina did, I certainly won't be surprised.

This car is relatively good on gas.  I haven't actually figured out what the exact numbers are, but if I had to draw a rough figure it'd be around 20mpg city.  I don't do enough constant highway driving to figure out what this car's highway efficiency is, but again, if I was forced to make an educated guess it would be approximately 25mpg.  To me, this is great, after my experiences with much larger SUVs that seem to burn gas as fast as you can pump it in.

The minor details about this car are the best part.  It's got a relatively good stereo, it's comfy, and my friend Eric assures me that it's "mad chill".  Oh yeah, and visibility is good and it's supposed to be safe too.

Final grade: A modest B+
