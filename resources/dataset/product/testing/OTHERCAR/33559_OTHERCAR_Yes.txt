            I have owned this vehicle for only three years, but it has never let me down.  I had a house fire last year, and although my garage was torched and my other car's interior melted, this car was unphased.  It is the true luxury sports car.  Superior handling, luxury, and ride.
Once you have drove such a car, as with most Mercedes-Benz, you will wonder why you have ever operated anything else.  The two things that can be disliked about this car are the gas mileage, although if you can afford the car, the gas should come easy.  The other is that once you purchase such an automobile, you will learn what true worry is.  You will start to notice that you do not park as close to the building entrance as possible for fear of your car being scratched.  <br><br>
