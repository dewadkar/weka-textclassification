            I recently sold my 1989 Ford Thunderbird LX (V6) and bought the 1999 Grand Am SE (3.4).  My first thought before I test drove the Grand Am, was, "I do not like front wheel drive, why would I buy a front wheel drive car?".  Well, luckily I gave the car a test drive before making a bias decision, and I was pleasantly suprised, to say the least.  The car outhandled my T-bird, out accelerated it, and was much more lighter (the t-bird is a portly 4000 pounds with me in it, compared with 3250 of the Grand Am).  The only problem that I have had with the car is a power window failure on the drivers side door.  I got the extended warranty with the car, so that was free to fix, was without the car for 5 hours, no biggee.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable, but at 6'0" tall, it's more cramped then the T-bird.  The stereo system (CD Player) is decent sounding and crisp, but the buttons are oversized, look cheap, and the display gets garbled sometimes.  I plan on replacing it with an aftermarket head unit anyways, so that is no big deal either.  The gauges are easy to read (they look cool to) and aren't distracting to the eye while driving.  When pushed, the engine rises to the occassion, providing ample torque and horsepower (you'll notice a crapload of torque steer if you gun it from a dead stop).  I average about 275 miles per tank, which I think is really good considering the fact that I drive in stop and go traffic mainly.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a semi-sports car, but can't dole out the cash for a T/A or Camaro SS.  Buy this instead of a Honda and you won't be dissappointed.
