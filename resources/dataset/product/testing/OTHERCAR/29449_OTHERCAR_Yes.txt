            Although my sisters first new car was a great looking Chrysler, Seabring, I was incredibly impressed with her second purchase of a 99 Jeep Wrangler. I never thought she would let me as little as sit in the drivers seat, but she actually let me drive it around a few times.  
It is a white one that came with a black hard top and a soft top.  As I drove down the road with the top off in the summer time I had a feel of style and class.  Not only was I the sh1t when my friends saw me in it, but they thought my sister was the sh1t too for picking out such a great vehicle.
It's great for any weather condition and she has told me that shes gone off roading with it more than once.  Going mudding through the fields of Troy, Pennsylvania is an experience unlike any other.  Living on a farm and having fields of my own I have done a little mudding myself because I owned an 85 blazer.  
I would recomend purchasing a Wrangler to anyone looking around for a new or a used car.  These are easily driven, don't go too incredibly fast (not as much injury if wrecked), and work well in the winter time.  Also, what could be better than cruising around with the top down in the summertime with the sun shining down on you.<br><br>
