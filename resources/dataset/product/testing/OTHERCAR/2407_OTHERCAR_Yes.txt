            I have owned my Jeep Cherokee for 5 years now and I still love it to this very day.  I have never had a lick of problems with the Jeep other than normal wear and tear such as general maintenance and new tires.  The Jeep I own is just the standard Jeep Cherokee.  It is automatic but has no power anything in it, which I like because there are fewer thing to go wrong.  I have 60,000 miles on it and it runs great.  I have a family of four and the size of the vehicle is just great for us, although I must say I prefer to sit in the front due to leg room in the back seat.  The only negative thing I could say about the Jeep is the gas mileage which gets about 17 miles to the gallon but from what I understand thats pretty normal for SUV'S.  If your wanting a SUV and not wanting to pay the higher price for one I would recommend the Jeep Cherokee, I found it to be very reasonable.<br><br>
