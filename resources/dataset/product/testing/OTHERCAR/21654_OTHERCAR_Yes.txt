            I love this car, it is the best I have ever owned. My parents bought it for me for Christmas last year after I got of of basic training for the Marines. I have had this car for a little over a year and have had no problems. There are many things that I liked about it that caused me to buy it. The ride is very quiet even at highway speeds. The ride and handling are sporty, as well as very smooth and comfortable.I have the V6 model and I am quite satisfied with the HP an Torque. For a car with a 6 cylinder it get pretty good gas mileage. The interior is very comfortable even on long road trips and spacious except for the back it could use a little more room. The transmission is decent but a little sluggish shifting in the low gears. I have an automatic so I can't speak for the manual. Other than that the only drawbacks are that it has a wide turning radius for its size but I think the design and mechanics of the car are sound and of good quality.My experience has been nothing but a good one. and I would certainly recommend it to a friend. I give it a good solid 4 stars.<br><br>
