            I loved my Canon Rebel 2000 SLR camera, but was taking so many pictures, the cost of developing pictures was great.  I decided to make the change to digital.  I had a budget of $300.00 to $375.00 for a camera, so most of the better 3 Mpixel cameras were out. I would have to go after a 2-3 Mpixel camera.  I drove myself crazy pouring over all the camera reviews and going to the stores numerous times to hold and visually inspect the cameras.  I decided on the Olympus D-510.  After using it for about 6 months and taking hundreds of pictures, I am extremely pleased with the the ease of use and the quality of the photos.  I have used the camera on vacation to the mountains as well as at the kid's sporting events. A little blurry on fast action events (basketball) but the camera is capable of taking several fairly fast sequential shots to get the right picture.  I also used it quite a bit to video record and then critique the kid's shooting, throwing, and running techniques for sports (need a dedicated camcorder? Maybe not). I am able to blow pictures up to 8 X 10's and the quality of the picture remained great.  The camera is easy to hook up to the computer via USB and download pictures to relatives.  The Camedia software included is a bit weak as far as photo editing.  I would recommend a stand alone photo editing software if you want the best pictures. 

I used a 64 MB Smartmedia card and it took care of all my needs, even handling a fair amount of Quicktime video.  The regular alkaline batteries lasted for about 250 shots, but I recommend the NiMH batteries.  They seem to last forever before needing recharge.
