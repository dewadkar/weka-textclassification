            A really gutsy little camera ideal for the entry-level digital photographer. I bought mine not knowing quite what to expect as I had never used a digital camera before, but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Great for web publishing and also pretty good results when printing out colour photos provided you keep the pic reasonably small. Otherwise it does get a bit pixally - but hey...what do you want for the price ??? A good camera certainly for the "snapper" and web user. Software provided seemed to be certainly adequate giving a gallery display of all downloaded shots. Easy to understand instructions. The only thing I would say is that when you download shots I would get a regulated external power supply to save the internal battery as it doesn't last too long and can be expensive.
