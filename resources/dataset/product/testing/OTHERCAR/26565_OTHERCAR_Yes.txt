            I leased a 1993 Nissan Sentra XE in 93' when that model was new. Now, things have changed and the compact class now has better competitors and more options and horsepower. But back then, it was a sweet little ride. It looked nice on the outside, and it was pretty comfortable on the inside, yet the rear seats were very cramped. The lack of a tachometer on the dash made this car very basic and dull. 

I leased it for 3 years and put 45,000 miles on it. It ran without a hitch and no problems at all. I even ran the hell out of it and it still ran on and on. It kind of says something about the reliability of a Nissan, which lead me to later purchase and Altima which I still drive today. The power was rather lacking, especially in passing maneuvers. Passing was quite an adventure since it took long enough to overtake another vehicle. 

You can't go wrong with this car if you are trying to save money on fuel and just want a reliable ride. Its the ideal car for college students who don't need to worry about cars. With todays ridiculous gas prices, a purchase is very justified.
