            I  just graduated college and got my first real job last year.  I knew it was high time to trade in my wonderful 93 Plymouth Duster (although I loved it so!) for a newer, more reliable car.  I shopped all the cars that were in the same class (Cavaliers, Prizms, Saturns).  Cavaliers were nice, but they felt cheap on the inside.  No details, stark equipment, etc.  Then, the last car I tried, a Sunfire was perfect!  It was sporty, but still comfortable.  The big plus was the interior details.  Nicer seats, smooth instruments, streamlined dash, that did it for me.  It just felt like a nicer car.  Since I bought mine, I have LOVED it!  It's been great for jetting about town and also for longer road trips.  Plenty of trunk space, great sound system, and I have had NO problems.  One of the funniest things is that people think it's an expensive car!  They say, &quot;how did you afford that sporty thing?&quot;  Little do they know it's the same cost as a Cavalier or Prizm.  I love it and when it's time to consider a new car I'll definitely look at Sunfires again!  <br><br>
