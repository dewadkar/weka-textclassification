            Yes, That right.  I enjoyed working with the Mavica MVC-FD83 at work so much, I actually bought a second on for home use.  I purchased it originally so that the project managers at my business could take photos in the field. Then they could send the photos via e-mail back to the office without having to wait for development.

One of the best features of this camera is that it uses 3 1/2&quot; floppy disks.  Very nice!  No messing with memory cards for me!  

Additionally this camera has two other nice features.  One is that you can use the camera to send it's output to a standard television.  No computer needed!  The other nice feature I like is that you can take short (15 second) video clips that also contain audio!

The camera's output is clean and crisp.  The detail is astounding.  We actually took a picture of a blueprint and we could read the writing in the image.  Just for grins, I took the same picture with a regular (35mm) camera and a Polaroid.  The Polaroid couldn't even be read and the regula camera only showed the big print, not the fine detail that was crystal clear with the Mavica.

The bottom line is if you decide to purchase this camera you will not be sorry.  It is worth every penny.<br><br>
