            What a lemon!  My tale of agony began when I bought my 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan new.  1112 miles later I was having the ENGINE replaced (yes, the engine) after a cam shaft catastrophic failure.  Since then it has been recalled three times, the radiator melted down at about 20,000 miles, rear a/c loop replaced, sliding door actuators replaced (5 times, 2 per door plus one more!), and a multitude of malfunctioning switches.  Also include gremlin or two in the shape of wipers that turn on by themselves, flickering lights, and a dash that occasionally goes black and that's my van.

On the plus side, when it runs it is a very well designed space for the passengers though lifting the &quot;removable&quot; seats out takes three men and a small boy (or just me but with lots of grunts).

The worst part is Detroit's response to all of this which has been the attitude of (1) we fix everything that we shoddily manufactured didn't we? to (2) go away, or sue us, but quit bothering us.

I will avoid all Dodge products and I recommend you do to.<br><br>
