            Sigh.   Well, I did it again.  

After selling a '97 540i Auto after tiring of bi-monthly trips to the shop for niggling little problems, my wife and I searched and searched for a good new or used car that was fun, safe, good looking, and affordable.  We considered the VW Passat(too much body roll, poor dealer service, no dealers near my house, underpowered), the Audi A4(too small, new ones hard to get w/o tons of options that drive the price up), a used Lexus GS400(hard to find a nice one, pricey for a used model due to their great reputation, too much body roll) and even a Lexus LS400 (very nice cruiser, but not as fun to drive, and not cheap, either)

What did I end up with?  Sigh. ANOTHER BMW 540i. This time though, we went with a better example, and decided on a 6 speed manual sport version.   $33,500 with 59,000 miles and in great shape.   It has a 100K extended warranty and so far I'm very happy with it.  

Because I have reviewed the E39 540i before(see my reviews), I will refer you to that for my impressions and simply list the pros and cons of buying a used 540i.   I will also point out some differences between the various 5 series models.  

The lineup:

525i -  Available from 2001. The same basic chassis, and looks pretty much the same as the more pricey versions, with some wheel and tire differences.   I think that for the price (over $40,000) it is underpowered and will leave many drivers frustrated and coveting the more powerful models.  0-60mph in 8.5 seconds (auto) is adequate, but will have Accords and Camrys blazing by you.  I'd be happy with one, but would worry about always wanting a little more power.  I think a slightly used 528i would be a better choice if you want more than just a family car.

528i - A really nice package.  The car really goes with a manual transmission and I think this is the model for most drivers to buy.  It's fast enough for sane drivers, but sporting enthusiasts might feel a little sluggish with the auto version.  The sports package really improves the looks/handling, at a modest price in terms of ride quality. Non-sport Bimmers strike me as a definite step down in looks and performance.  Upgraded to 530i status and 225 hp in 2001.  Noticeably quicker with the new engine.  

540i - The V-8 version.  282 hp.   Very fast.  0-60 times of 5.6 seconds have been reported for the 6 speed manual.  I can't drive mine that fast, because frankly I'm not that good a driver and don't care about drag racing.  But it still has more power than I thought possible.  For those with the money, it's great to have. But at a $10,000 premium over the new 530i version, I would buy a used 540i or a new 530i, not a new 540i.  

Now 3,500 miles into my 2nd 540i ownership experience, here are my arguments for/against owning one.  

PRO:

Fantastic combination of ride/handling.

Top notch braking, very secure and stable at even 100mph.  Few other sedans can match it.

Great looking car w/ sports pkg 17" wheels.   Very aggressive, wide stance.  Just looks cool.  

Super safety. One of the best crash tests ever, head airbags, abs, all the goodies. Unfortunately the '98 6 speed does NOT have stability control.  Automatics do.  The combination of super handling/braking , a 3800 curb weight, and a tank-like structure are hard to beat.  Overall, I think it's one of the best on the road, period.  A huge SUV may be big, but it's harder to avoid accidents in.  A nimble small car can avoid accidents, but is vulnerable when it does crash.  This was my #1 reason for buying BMW. Safety.

Nice materials and luxury, though though Lexus and others probably do "luxury" better.  The "Germanic" feel of the seats and materials is not what some expect in a luxury car.  Very comfortable seats for long trips, though.

The 540i is very fast for a sedan.  You feel the G forces as you accelerate, at ANY speed.  A touch of the throttle and you're past someone on the expressway.  Annoyed by a tail-gater on a lonely road?  In about 10 seconds you can leave him 1/4 mile behind you.  Combines sports car handling and power in a practical package.  It's not a Corvette, but it's much safer and more spacious.  For safety reasons on today's crowded roads, I don't drive this car anywhere near its potential.  I can control this car, but I can't control someone pulling out in front of me.   The extra power is more for occasional thrills than regular use.  I also just like the "feel" of V-8 power vs. the excellent inline 6 of the 528i.  Used, they're close enough in price that it's not a huge extra expense.  I found that used 540's were generally in better condition than 528's.  Perhaps their owners were more serious car guys, or they had the extra money to properly maintain them.  I think there are a lot of leased 528i's out there that were used by people who probably couldn't afford to own them.  According to Motor Trend, far fewer 540i's were leased than typical for luxury cars.  

You can get a manual transmission in a BMW 5 series, unlike Lexus cars and some other makes.  We got this car because it was the nicest available at a good price, but with time passing I'm really glad its a manual.   I enjoy driving more with a manual.  You feel more connected to the car's power.  Sometimes it's a pain in stop-n-go, but even then it's not too bad.  If you like to hold a cup of coffee and relax while driving, gently gliding over potholes, get a Lexus.  If you love making crisp turns and feeling glued to the road, consider the BMW.   You feel confident at nearly any speed. I didn't feel that way with the GS 400 at all.  It floated all over the place.   


CON:

These cars are expensive to own.  They're initially expensive for their content and they aren't as reliable as Japanese makes, though the problems you do have are usually electrical and trim items, not mechanical breakdowns.  They aren't unreliable, but you'd expect a little better for the price.  If you're busy and want a hassle-free experience, try a Lexus.   Even warrantied items will require a trip to the dealer.  If you're mentally prepared for the occasional problems, then you'll be happy with a BMW.   Resale value is strong, but does fall off some when they reach higher mileage, due to buyers being wary of the high repair costs of a German car. 

Comfort and Luxury:  For broad shouldered drivers, the BMW's sport seats(and non-sport, for that matter) can be a tight fit.  I have adjusted, but this is not as comfortable a car as the Lexus GS in my opinion.   There is also a little more road feel (which enthusiasts love) and noise than some might want.  It's not bad at all, but it's not a vault either.  

Stereo choices:  Not great.  Overpriced.   Hard to upgrade.  Very poor AM reception and a trunk mounted CD changer are other negatives.  If you are an audiophile, be prepared to spend a lot on a custom system.  It's a nice stereo, but not worth the price.  If you like to listen to talk radio, be aware that AM reception isn't very good.  

Image:  This is a double-edged sword.  Some people feel like pigs in slop in a BMW. They love the upscale image combined with the sexy, sporty image.   While I can appreciate that, I'm not one of them.  My attitude is that it's not like I built it myself, and any fool can blow his retirement savings on an expensive car.   Why take pride in that?  Buy one because you appreciate its unique characteristics, not because it's cool.  And guys, only the shallowest gold digger out there will like you because of your BMW.  If that's all you've got going for you, that's just sad.  You will get lots of admiring looks and comments from other "car people".  It's considered one of the ultimate dream rides out there.  Then again, most people have no idea that your 540i is anything different than a 325i.  I didn't until about 2 years ago, when I began researching cars and learned to appreciate the differences in various models. 

The negative side of the BMW image is that a LOT of people out there will envy or resent you.   They either think you're automatically a snob.  Or they remember the last BMW driver who they saw weaving through rush hour traffic at 90mph.   You also may be a little more vulnerable to crime when driving a Bimmer, but that may go for any luxury car.  Your problems may run from  vandalism by the envious(who hasn't seen a keyed bimmer in a mall parking lot?) to robbery.  You will also get "the wave" from other drivers to merge a lot less often than you did in your Chevy Corsica.  

The 6 speed manual transmission.  A mixed blessing.  My impression matches that of various car review magazines.  It isn't that great.  It's a little notchy, there is way too much shift throw for a sporty car, and clutch uptake takes a while to get good at.   BMW's 5 speed is much better, it's great in fact.   Another reason to go with a 528i or 530i, perhaps.  

Various minor engineering quirks that BMW for some reason refuses to fix, despite it being quite easy to do so.
- cupholders....too small and fragile.
- what's the deal with the worthless "mpg" gauge?
- A $12,000 car can have decent radio reception? Why can't  this $60,000 one?
- My '83 Toyota Supra had knob-adjustable side bolsters on the drivers seat, for the broad-backed. BMW should add this feature.
- brittle bakalite plastics on radio/climate/etc that tend to stick and break with age.   
- Overly complex LED gauge cluster that doesn't last the life of the car.
- Annoying check system that gives false alarms on lights, coolant, etc. 
- No storage console on the driver's armrest.  Do Germans not have pens and junk too?
- A speedometer that is off by quite a bit.  At least 5% too optimistic.  Why would any modern car have that?  All Bimmers seem to have this problem and have for years.  Several car mags have tested them and reported on this, yet it never gets fixed.  Odd.
-Overly complex climate control and radio buttons, onboard computer, and buttons with symbols that make no sense whatsoever.  You have to read the manual carefully to use this car.  

Finally, there is the Luxury car engine problem.  I may be wrong here, but how come adding a bigger engine costs $500 more on a pickup truck, but $5,000 to $10,000 on a BMW?  Supply and demand maybe, or technical reasons?   I'd like to see BMW sell many more cars and get prices down.  The car is an amazing piece of engineering.  But they sometimes over-engineer it and add too many features.  I bet a "stripper" 530i could be sold at a good profit for $40,000 if they worked on it.  


CONCLUSION:   The BMW 5 series is the best combination of safety, luxury, driving fun, and practicality out there.   Only if you value all four is it the best car for you.
