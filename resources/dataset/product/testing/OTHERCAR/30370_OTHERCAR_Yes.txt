            Well, it was September already and the past 3 years had screamed by without even looking back.  Yes, it was time to turn in my 1997 GMC Jimmy.  The lease was up and so were the new Jimmy prices.  But then that had been the story for the last 3 Jimmy's I had owned.  I like the Jimmy and I was ready to get a new one.  All I needed to check out were colors and options. I had moved from the snow and mountains of Utah winters to the Green Country of Oklahoma since my last Jimmy so I decided to leave the 4 Wheel Drive behind this time and save a little cash. I took my teenage son and daughter with me and we hit the local Pontiac/GMC dealer for our new set of wheels.

As soon as we got there I went over to the line up of new Jimmys and started picking out my wall paper.  I had just started feeling the new warmth of the available colors when I heard my kids yelling to me from across the car lot. They were shouting and waving their arms so wildly that I thought there was some sort of problem afoot, so I high tailed it across the lot to bail them out. By the time I got there it was to late. The attack had already begun and casualties had already been taken. Yes, we had been attacked by the Azteks and all hope was lost.

This car/truck/SUV/Minivan has everything I wanted and even came with a couple of extras that I wasn't counting on.  With more room all around than my Jimmy I found it down right spacious. It has great head and shoulder room and the back seat is much more comfortable for the young folks.  It even has a 3rd shoulder belt back there.  That's a new one for me.  With the way those back seats can be folded up and removed it is hard to believe how comfortable it is back there.

The front panel layout is very Y2K and at night is so easy to read with its red plazma screen glow. It has plenty of cup holders and with the front cooler installed it's good for a real road trip. There are enough &quot;Oh #@*%&quot; handles to go around and cargo nets for every thing.  You can even go to the big game and put on a tailgate party for the masses. With the tailgate down you have two &quot;Buttouts&quot; molded right in and cupholders to match. It even has complete audio controls in the rear cargo area for the 6 CD, 10 speaker, Pioneer Audio system. Why that system even tells you who's playing what song on your favorite FM station.

Now I didn't get the Tent or the rear slide out cargo tray with mine but I did get the Sun Roof and 6 way power drivers seat. I even discovered the replaceable air filter for the ventilation system today while I was cleaning it up.

Now the ride is something that completely surprised me.  It rides about like a Grand Prix.  I wasn't ready for that feel because I was used to my Jimmy and its &quot;Truck Feel&quot;.  It has plenty of power at 185 HP but I still need to get used to the front wheel drive power train. One thing that still makes me smile is the fact that it doesn't use a prop rod to hold up the hood like most cars today.  The hood will actually stay up by itself.  I haven't seen that on cars since the 70's

Well, we really love this Aztek of ours.  We still get double head turners and finger pointers when we drive around town and the kids just love that. I can't wait until the next new model comes out in a couple of years. I want to see what else they can engineer into this thing.<br><br>
