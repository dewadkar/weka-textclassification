            My first digicam was a small point and shoot that could take pics no better than 320x240. It was one of the first digital cameras sold for the consumer market, and I hadn't had one that small until I got the Canon IXUS 300, which is the same as the Elph S300, but is sold by Canon in Europe and Asia only. Thankfully, Canon did not decide to sell a small camera with small features. This camera has everything a good digital camera should have tody. 3x optical zoom (the lens is very cool), 2.11 megapixels, removable flash, video mode, fire wire connection, built in flash, 9 resolution modes, digital zoom, a viewfinder, a bright LCD, power saving features, and a video out connection.

The small size was one of the outstanding features I missed since I had my first digicam, and the Canon delivers better because of its top 2.11 megapixel resolution. Sure, you might prefer to use your money on a 3 megapixel camera, but you'll have to buy a bulky camera if you do. The reallity is you probably will notice that you are less likely to take many shots with your digicam, if its bulky because you've got other things to carry as well. Size matters and the IXUS 300 will prove it. 

The camera is very easy to use. My manual was written in what was a foreign language for me so I had to point and shoot my way in the dark for a few days. I did so, and it was quite easy. The controls are well designed and their functions are quite intuitive. This camera feels natural in your hands because its body is made of steel, not plastic, and it has enough weight so that it does not feel as if you might drop it after forgetting it's in your hand. 

The camera has a manual mode, which is a surprising feature for a point and shoot. That's a fine thing, but the automatic setting has a notably drawback; it requires you to really press down on the shutter so the camera can automatically adjust focus. This has the effect of making shutter speed a little slower than what I have experienced with other digicams. Aside from shutter speed, however, I have no complaints about this camera. It has a viewfind and a sharp LCD. Use the LCD to view pics AFTER they have been shot. It's slightly less accurate for shooting than is typical for digicams today.

The battery is rechargeable, but you defintely will want to either buy a second regular battery or the extended battery. This is typical for digicams using rechargeable batteries so I would not consider it a disadvantage for this camera.


I purchased this camera on travel because it was cheaper than the version sold in the U.S. (Digital Elph S300), otherwise the IXUS 300 and the Digital Elph S300 are essentially identical. (Given the strength of the American dollar, savvy shoppers might want to consider this if you are on travel or if you know how to shop websites designed for Europeans or Japanese. Your manual might be printed in a foreign language, but Canon has posted the English language version manual online for downloading as an Adobe *.pdf file. You will also want to be sure to get the right power converter for the recharger, if appropriate).
