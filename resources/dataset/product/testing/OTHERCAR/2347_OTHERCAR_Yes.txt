            I purchased the PDR-M4 strictly based on the quality of picture that I was shown at the retailer. Because of my needs, high resolution is a must. This camera fits the bill. It has 2.1 megapixel resolution and is simple to use. I still haven't read the manual and I have used it for over 3 months. I can use the macro to capture close-ups on circuit boards with detail that satisfies government agencies that used to demand 35mm photos.

I gave the camera to a young colleague to document a visit to a company we were considering doing business with. I gave him no instructions and he came back with professional photos. There were no bad shots!
It is compact, lightweight, and appears to be very rugged.

The drawback is that the rechargeable batteries tend to run down while the unit is sitting unused. You must be sure to recharge before you intend to use the camera.

The software that is provided with the camera is user friendly and has some great features for enhancing the photos.

I would recommend this camera to the professional or the family that takes thier photos seriously. At $500 it is a little pricey for the average consumer. Also at this price a case should be included with the camera and it is not.

Overall though, two thumbs up and a snap!
