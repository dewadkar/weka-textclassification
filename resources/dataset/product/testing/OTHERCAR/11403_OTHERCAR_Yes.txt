            When our two youngest sons grew too tall to sit comfortably in the third seat of our 1996 Camry wagon, we went back to Bob Baker Toyota, in Lemon Grove, and leased a new Y2K 4Runner. During the past four years we have become a Bob Baker Toyota family, having bought or leased the Camry, a 1996 Tercel, a 1996 Tacoma, a 1998 Corolla, a 1996 Rav4, a Tacoma 4X4, the 4Runner, a 2001 Prerunner and another 4Runner, a 2001. We had a 1986 Toyota pickup that was stolen in July.
Except for the '86 truck, which we bought very used, with 100,000 hard miles on the odometer, we have had absolutely zero trouble with our Toyotas. All they get is gasoline, oil and regular service.
That means a lot to my wife, after driving a liquid-cooled Volkswagen Vanagon that overheated constantly, and blew its head gaskets twice during the three years we owned it. 
My wife loves the 4Runner and has no plans to replace it at the end of the lease. She gets 20-24 mpg and has all the comfort and power she could want, Toyota car stereos are the best we've ever had and the air conditioners are much better than the ones in our Volkswagens and Volvos. 
Our oldest daughter was so impressed with her Mom's 4Runner that when the transmission on her Windstar went out, our daughter went to Bob Baker and leased her own 2001 4Runner. Our son-in-law had been planning to buy a Ford F-150 pickup when they had finished paying for the Ford van, but the premature failure of the transmission changed his plans. He loves his new Toyota, and will probably never buy another Ford.<br><br>
