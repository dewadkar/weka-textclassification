            I have owned a loaded Avalon XLS for about a month now.  I'd like to share what I see as the pluses and minuses of this vehicle.  But first, I'd like to mention that I compare shopped this car versus the Volvo S70, the Acura TL, and the Nissan Maxima.  I felt the Avalon was roomier than all others and offered much more refinement than the Maxima and S70.  The Acura was a beautiful machine as well, but it wasn't large enough for growing children, and the dealer would not deal much from the sticker price.  The Acura had the smoothest transmission of all cars compared, with a five speed automatic that shifted smoothly and effortlessly. The Avalon dealer gave me the best price by far, about $400 above invoice, so I went with it.

The Avalon is incredibly quiet and refined.  The engine is silky smooth and the ride is supple.  The 210 hp motor gets it going, though not quickly off the line.  At about 2000 rpm, the car accelerates briskly.  On bumpy roads when there are rear seat passengers, the car seems too soft, as it almost bottoms out on the rear suspension.  So if you're looking to move around other back seat passengers, keep this in mind.  I wish Toyota had offered a self-leveling feature with air shocks in the back. 

The car handles well enough, though nowhere near the sportier feel of the Acura and Nissan.  But you have to sacrifice somewhere if you want this smooth and quiet of a ride.  My car has the 16&quot; wheels, which seem to wander too much where the road crest, or cant,  may take them.  Other than these smaller issues, I am extremely pleased with the car and would recommend it.  The interior is huge with logical feature arrangement. <br><br>
