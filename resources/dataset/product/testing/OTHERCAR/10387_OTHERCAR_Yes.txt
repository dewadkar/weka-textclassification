            We own a 1998 Kia Sephia which was bought new as a replacement for a 1986 Ford Taurus my wife used.  The car was bought with just about every extra offered by Kia, including automatic, air conditioning, power windows, power door locks, power steering, power side mirrors, a cd am fm radio, and power windows .  We have been very pleased with the car in every way, but don't expect a Cadillac for the $12,000 this car cost us even with all the extras mentioned above.  The ride is good but not great.  The car is not exactly quiet, but bearable.  The radio is good, but not a Boise. I can go on like this about every component of the car.  We are very satisfied with the car.  it has given us everything and more than we expected for the dollars we spent.  We even average better than 30mpg at Interstate speeds on long trips and better than 25mpg on everyday travel.

The service Kia has provided has been good.  we did have an electrical problem when the car was first purchased.  it took the dealer almost a month, and the factories help, to find the problem with a wire in the front fender, but Kia provided and paid for a rental replacement for the entire time the car was being repaired.  since that time the car has given us no trouble at all and we have 30,000 miles on it in a year and a half.

I do suggest strongly to Kia that they include a light in the trunk especially when the car includes the special features package offered.  better front speakers for the radio would be an idea too.
