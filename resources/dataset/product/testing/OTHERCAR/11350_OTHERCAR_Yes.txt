            Among my favorite things about my 1999 Dodge Gran Caravan is the well thought out design.  I travel for business quite a lot, sometimes with clients; it is important that I have a vehicle that not only accommodates my family, including a 13 year old with lots of friends, but also handles my work requirements.  Versatility is the key here.  If I need to haul equipment, I simply remove the back seats.  If I need to haul a lot of equipment, I remove both sets of seats.  They are relatively easy to take out and put back in, although, unless you're a power lifter, it is a two person job. For extra grocery space, I simply fold down one set of seats, and I do make good use of the bag holders.

I've had as many as 7 adults in the car.  For rides under 45 minutes, it is quite comfortable.  Rides over 45 minutes, should be limited to no more than 6 adults for maximum comfort. One small feature that has made a world of difference is the extra power outlet in the car.  This allows a passenger in the back to operate a personal CD Player or laptop computer without cords hanging all over the van.  It also allows me to recharge my laptop computer with the back outlet during car trips, while keeping my cell phone plugged in up front.  I also appreciate the extra storage bins and all the cup holders when taking my daughter's friends on field trips.

Recently, a junk truck driving right in front of me, lost a large metal pipe.  I tried as best I could, but could not avoid hitting it entirely.  I did manage to just clip it with the driver side tire.  To my surprise, the van handled very well; I maintained control and did not skid, and my tire did not blow out.  The metal pipe did bend the rim of the tire.  There was a Honda Accord and a Mercedes immediately behind me.  Both of these cars blew out both of their front tires on the pipe.  Therefore, I was very pleased with the handling and safety of my mini van.

On the Con side, I agree that the front tires wear out excessively quickly, the van tends to be somewhat noisy, especially airflow sounds on the freeway, and small electrical problems do seem to occur (the driver's side power window sometimes doesn't work in really hot weather - we can find no electrical or mechanical reason for this problem).  IF Dodge could just fix these small problems they would have a truly incomparable mini van.<br><br>
