            I was narrowing down my choices to either get a BMW 735i or a Lexus SC400. I decided on the BMW. Since I bought it I changed the exhaust, strut cartridges, a fog light, and some hoses. I still need to get the light for the onboard computer changed (it works, but it appears dim), to get the bulb replaced will take about 2 hours, BMW quoted it as being around $200 worth of labor to replace a $1 part. You should only buy this type of car (or any luxury car) if you can afford to maintain it. The muffler for the car was $600, for my Chrysler it was $30. Is the car worth the price? Yes. The car has many features, such as heated seats, lumbar support, it even has a radio station built in that gives you weather (WB - Weather Band). The car has a lot of room, for both front and rear passengers. I like the dual climate controls for the driver and passenger side, as well as a feature that allows you to close the windows and sunroof from the outside of the car using the doorlock. The cars acceleration is also very fast. It has a 6 cylinder engine, but can easily beat an 8 cylinder car. When I merge onto the highway I put the car in 3rd gear, which lights up an &quot;s&quot; on the dashboard meaning that it is in sports gear, in this gear the car accelerates tremendously. The braking is also very good, I went from 55 to a stop in a couple seconds, without skidding. The traction control makes driving in rain like driving on a dry road. Although the car is costly, you get what you pay for. <br><br>
