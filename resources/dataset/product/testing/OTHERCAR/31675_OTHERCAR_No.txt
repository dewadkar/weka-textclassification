            I always bought a G.M. product if I could, I won't anymore!!

I leased a 1997 chev astro van 1st year was ok. Not impressed with it in the snow.
in our 30th month at mileage 52k the problems began. the brakes went on it. cost $695.00,on a new vehicle still under warranty! then the metal on metal squeeks in the front end, this is when they found my right front tire worn down to the cords, cant do anything for u, they didnt have any tires so I p/u 4 tire @ Costco Then went to Sears for an alignment.Sorry we cant do  one you need new Idler arms cost $895.00. this is **** take back to dealer and they check it out every thing is O.K. meanwhile we have to keep the steering wheel turned to the left to keep it going straight, this along with the shimmy in the front end.
take to another large tire co. same story cant do alingment to much play in the idler arms cost to replace $695.00. ( with one wheel locked on table you can move the other wheel back an forth!)
Take back to dealer say they can do alignment the idlers are fine. they did the job  the van still shimmies and the steering wheel came back turned to the left when going straight!
check out the web for T.S.B.(service bulletins)there was a page one early brake wear!! and a page an half on front end alignment problems!!!! 
they Know it has a bad front end and brakes but still would not do anything for me. I got rid of it after unsucesfully trying to get a response from the G.M. in Oshawa.
In my epinion the astro is as bad as the Chrysler Mini Van ( had 1 of those too that's another story!)
