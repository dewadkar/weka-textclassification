             Just checking in to provide my take on a great, relatively inexpensive, sporty little car-the 2004 Chevy Cavalier!

 I purchased my Cavalier,a 2 door coupe model, about five months ago, and have thoroughly enjoyed this vehicle. I will begin with the appearance. The car features a sleek, streamlined body. The appearance's of the front and rear ends have been significantly improved this year to give the car a more sophisticated, aerodynamic look. The breakaway mirrors are a nice feature, as are the front mud guards. I also like the design of the lights, and the bold, golden Chevrolet bowtie emblems on front and back.

 The interior also presents with a sporty feel, with bucket
seats, and the flat extended dashboard. I bought this Cavalier with the popular package, which includes air conditioning, automatic transmission, tachometer, CD stereo with premium speakers, tilt wheel, variable speed wipers, an additional center console cupholder(I did get a laugh out of the fact that this is considered an option), visor vanity mirrors, a rear spoiler, the aforementioned mud guards, power locks, and a keyless entry system. Not bad for a version of the car just one step above the base model! About the only thing lacking is power windows.The rear window defogger leaves a little to be desired, as it only seems to cover about half the window, and doesn't work all that fast. Only a minor complaint however.

 As for space, I have no problem. I am 6'2", 220 lbs. and don't feel cramped in the least. The rear seats wouldn't accomodate much more than a medium sized adult, however.
The trunk space is fairly large for the size of the car, and the rear seats fold down with a 40/60 split to allow more cargo room. The car also features a surprisingly large glove compartment, and various other storage compartments in
and around the center console.

 When it comes to driveability, I feel the Cavalier handles extremely well. Steering is tight, braking is good, and it has an overall nice, not too bouncy ride for a car of this class. The 2.2 liter DOHC engine(a new addition to the car in 2003) definitely has some pick up. 0-60 time is estimated at 8 seconds. I've had no trouble whatsoever making a quick pass of a slow moving vehicle, or shooting up a highway entrance ramp. Compared to other small vehicles in this class that I've driven, the Cavalier stands out with great acceleration. Fuel economy is excellent. I get about 27mpg standard with mixed city and highway driving, and 34-36 mpg on the highway. On a recent 350 mile trip with 2 other adults and a full load of cargo, I still pulled 35 mpg!

 Overall, if you're looking for a stylish, quality car that runs like a champ, offers a lot of nice features, and won't break your bank, the Cavalier is a prime choice. If you have the funding, you'll probably want to look into higher end models and all their fancy ammenities, but when it comes to a sporty dependable car for someone who doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg, you can't do much better than this! I regret to hear that Chevy is ceasing production of this model at the end of next year.
