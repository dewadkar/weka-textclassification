            	No frills, no unnecessary options, the Wrangler is a performer, plain and simple.  Fun to drive in any situation and ready for anything, this thing is worth every penny of its (+/-) $17,000 price tag.

	I got mine with a hardtop for security and insulation reasons, but haven't had any trouble removing it when I want to.  The only question to ask when getting the hardtop is where to store the thing, but with a garage its not a problem.  Replacement soft and bikini tops can be had for a song through a wide variety of third party vendors, and they're easy to install.  The hardtop is definitely the way to go.

	The smaller engine that came in my SE is really only an issue when doing highway driving, but it can be kind of annoying in that situation.  Acceleration is painfully slow and few people really care that you could crush them in a cross-country race as they fly by at 65 mph.  But the experience of a Wrangler off-road makes up for all of it.

	This has been a great buy for me and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The service people that I have met, though never had to take me jeep in, have been honest and helpful, I've never had a problem.<br><br>
