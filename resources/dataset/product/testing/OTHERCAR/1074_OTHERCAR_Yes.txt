            I rented this 2001 Caddilac from Enterprise last week.  I have had it a week now and this is my story....

When I was taken to the vehicle, I almost fell over, why, this car is for old men!!  I first saw it when I drove into the Enterprise lot, the only car left.  It was a pretty color, Pearl White.  

I sat in the drivers seat and feel in love- I had never dreamed a car such as this would turn me on.

I drive out of the lot am and very impressed by the power, no hesitation.  The stereo is the next thing I turn to.. A BOSE RDS (9 speakers) three on the dash, two in the front doors, and two in the rear doors with two more in the rear dash.  I note that this car has a stereo that any young guy could be proud of.  :)

I next take note to the OnStar, and the handsfree cellular phone feature, nice.  

The interior is very roomy and 'peaceful', this model had black leather all the way around.  The digital dashboard also was an intresting feature I enjoyed.  

The gas tank took forever to empty!!  I drove 378 miles on a tank, and it cost me 25.00 to fill it up.  I got 20.3 miles to the gallon in the city, and a respectable 23 on the highway- that's great compared to other big v8's.  

All in all, I fell in love with this car overnight.  There were some features that were not easy to understand, however after using them a few times they became ok.
