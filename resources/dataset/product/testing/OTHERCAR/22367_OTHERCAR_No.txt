            When I was out looking for a new toy, the SC 430 was the first car to catch my eye.  With a futuristic, aerodynamic look to it, I figured it had to be good... and Lexus usually does a good job of impressing me.  However, I was greatly disappointed with the new output from the Japanese automobile giants.  The car is extremely powerful, and so it should be with a 4.3 L engine and 300 horses running its engine.  However, it just didn't feel right.  I figured, if I was gonna drop this much money, why not get something that I would thoroughly enjoy.  There are many pluses to this car such as the speed and the comfort, other specifics such as the acceleration and the overall look of the car are constant let downs.  I would say that if one is looking to buy a new speed demon, they should look more onto the real auto-giants, the M3, Z3, or even the CLK.
