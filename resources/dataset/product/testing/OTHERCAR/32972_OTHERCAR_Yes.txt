            I have owned my 1997 Camry LE for about 2 years now, having purchased it used with 47,000 miles on it.  At $16,000, it seemed a lot of money for a car. I bought it for the reliability, for the interior space, and it�s smooth riding. I owned a Honda before I bought my Toyota. Toyota was the better buy. Not that I don�t like Honda. I got over 100, 000 miles on it. The Toyota rides better and it is a better-made car. 


What's good about it? It has a soft and solid ride. How much a person likes it may be a matter of personal taste. Certainly, it drives like a big car: solid and calm. 
The leather upholstery is adequately luxurious. There is lots of passenger room and the trunk is big enough for lots of luggage and groceries. My car came with a sunroof, and 3 CD changer. The instrument panel is wisely displayed. The included holder for a garage door opener is a pleasant touch. The driver's side and passenger's side both have air bags. 

 The only problem I have is the paint on the front grill keeps chipping and flaking off. I have never seen this in any car I have owned and it is annoying. 

To be sure, there is much to praise about the Camry and my criticism are quite small. For reliability, comfort and economy it delivers the goods and maybe that's not too shabby!
