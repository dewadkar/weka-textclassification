            This car is one of the greatest values in all of Porsche's lineup. I bought mine last year for $5000, and have since seen the average price go up ~ $1000 for the same year. All around still a great value. I've had many people think that my 85 was brand new. Which is fairly amazing for a 15 year old car. 

You just can't beat the legendary handling of the Porsche 944. With a 52/48 weight distribution you can make many more mistakes than you could in other cars like the 911.

The thing that constantly amazes me as I work on it is the quality. Everything is very well thought out throughout the car. It's amazingly easy to work on, and can be done by any back yard mechanic.

Acceleration is great for a car of it's age. It'll still compete with many of today's cars. I've seen 0-60 times range from 7.2-8.5 seconds. 

If you're looking for a fast car, go with the 944 turbo (951) 230-250hp stock depending on which year you get with 0-60 times in the low 6's. There's also a lot more you can do with the 951s in the way of performance. I've seen people who have 600hp 951's. Not bad for a little 4 cyl, eh?<br><br>
