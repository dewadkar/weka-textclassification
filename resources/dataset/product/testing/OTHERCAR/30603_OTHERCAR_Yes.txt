            In 1995 I wanted an SUV and began looking around. I was surprised at the prices asked. Then I saw an ad for KIA's... I went to the dealership and 30 minutes later I was driving off the lot with my new 4x4 sportage.
       I have really enjoyed my KIA and I have really put it to the test. I've hauled 18 50# sacks of feed in it at a time, 18 wheeler parts, animals, and kids. I have been playing in the mud with my sportage and haven't gotten stuck yet !! 
   The back seat is big enough for my 6'2&quot; teenager with room for another tall kid and room in the middle for my 10 yr old. I can scoot the front seat so far back I can't reach the gas pedal and I'm 5'9&quot;. 
    The only trouble I've really had was a plugged ejector, a leak in my a/c hose,and a fuel pump. I have 120,000 miles on my sportage and many more to go. My husband doesn't like it because it isn't a stomp-em -and-pass-everyone-on-the-road type vehicle. He can stick to his truck !!
    Also, I was in a wreck in october. I was sitting at a red light when I was rear ended by a car going 40 mph. The only damage to my car was a sprung back hatch, driver's door sprung, rear passenger door sprung,a crease in the rear quarter panel, and the bumper in back and front shoved about 2 inches popping the clips holding them in place. The front bumper was messed up because when I was hit, I was shoved into another car. I was real impressed with the minimal damage done to my KIA. I'd recommend one to anyone.<br><br>
