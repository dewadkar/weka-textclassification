              Well I bought my Sunbird from a Pontiac Dealer where I live and I have had great experiences with it the only trouble I had with it was that the alternator went out after I bought it but it was totally covered.  It handles great and it saves gas very well.  It is comfy and I would recommend it to anyone who has kids too. My wife, 2 year old and I find it easy to get her in and out of it.  The paint is very good and also it has no rust spots on it for being a 1994 model.  The only thing I hate is that sometimes the fan-belts screachy but that is easily fixed with belt dressing.  It has a very good stereo which is factory.  All and all I would highly recommend it to anyone. It handles great in the snow and ice and has been completely reliable.<br><br>
