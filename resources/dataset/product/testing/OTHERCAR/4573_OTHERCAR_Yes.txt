            I used to own a 1992 Nissan Maxima, and liked the sporty look with all the luxury accessories.  When I went car shopping for a newer car, I was trying to find something with the same sporty look and luxury feel.

My search led me to an Infinity, made by the same makers as Nissan's.  When walking up to my car, the first think I noticed was the sporty look, my car having a spoiler on it.  The body style is nice, not boxy like older cars, but also not rounded to the extremes that some cars are becoming.  It still looks like a car...not a bowling ball!

When I looked inside the car, I was pleasantly surprised by the wood trim on the dashboard, the leather seats, the nice roomy interior, cd player, automatic transmission, moon/sunroof, digitalized heater/conditioner system, and the many more options the car has.  It had everything I was looking for, and some added features.

On the test drive, the car handled fantastically on the road.  It had a very smooth feel to it, the kind you would expect from any luxury car.  Quoting the movie Pretty Woman, &quot;it cornered like it was on rails&quot; was an understatement!

Needless to say, I bought the car.  This was all 3 years ago, and my car has just gotten better.  <br><br>
