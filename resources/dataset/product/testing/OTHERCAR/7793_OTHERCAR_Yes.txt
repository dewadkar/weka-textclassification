<TEXT>
            Fuji's new second-generation Finepix S2 Pro digital SLR is one of only three sub $2,500 digital SLR's available in the prosumer camera market.  All three cameras are very similar in their capabilities and appearance and all three offer serious amateur photographers and budget conscious pros the option to expand into advanced digital photography without breaking the bank.  Affordable digital SLR&#146s are a relatively new and important element in the continuing development of high-performance digital imaging tools because they utilize "on hand" components from consumer digital and analog cameras which results in more efficient manufacturing and that lowers prices. 

The S2 Pro, and The Nikon D100 are both based on Nikon's very popular N80 film camera, while Canon's new D60 is an updated version of the D30 which was based on Canon's popular EOS film cameras.  How does the S2 Pro compare to its primary competition?  Very well. I have used all three and what is truly amazing are not the differences between these three digital imaging tools, but rather the striking similarities. All three cameras are relatively expensive, but much cheaper than Nikon and Canon professional digital SLR's, and all three are targeted at a very narrow niche market---- professional, semi pro, and serious amateur photographers who want a digital SLR but don't want to spend more than four grand to buy a D1X or EOS 1D.

Like it's predecessor, the S2's most notable feature is its proprietary CCD imager.  Fuji's third generation "Super CCD" uses octagonal sensors instead of the square image sensors used in other digital cameras.  The octagonal sensors form a honeycomb-patterned array that is slightly more efficient and consequently able to record more image information than conventional sensor arrays.  Like its competitors the S2 Pro is a six-megapixel camera, but the S2 can use on board software to double that resolution to twelve megapixels through interpolation.  The interpolation process boosts picture resolution (the Camera's CPU analyses the original image and adds an equal number of like color pixels) to create a denser image file---- sort of like packing a size twelve girl into a pair of size six jeans.  Hypothetically (because individual picture elements are so tiny) the added pixels are invisible and improve detail in the image------in reality this isn't always true. Consumers need to be aware that there is no magic way to actually double image resolution.  However, photographers can use interpolation as one additional photographic tool; to improve color saturation, contrast, and apparent image sharpness, but it won&#146t work for every image or in every situation.  


Many photographers disapprove of interpolation, which is strange since ALL digital imaging devices use interpolation to boost color saturation, contrast, and image resolution. Need an example?  When the Nikon Coolpix 885 was introduced last year many consumers complained that it's "reds" were unrealistic.  Nikon&#146s engineers had programmed the CP885 to "boost" red because humans are highly sensitive to (and like) red. The problem was that the CP885's interpolation software did its job too well. Red is a highly admired color, but it also has strong primitive associations with fear and danger---and that created some unplanned (and unconscious) negative psychological reactions among CP885 users. The S2 Pro's interpolation option allows photographers to make most of the decisions about boosting resolution, color, and contrast rather than having all those decisions made by camera designers and digital engineers.  

The most important fact to consider is that the S2's Super CCD really does capture slightly more image detail than standard square CCD&#146s. The difference isn&#146t going to turn a poor image into a stellar photo, but in the hands of a skilled photographer, the extra image data can make a noticeable difference in image quality relative to a similar image recorded by a standard CCD.  Simply put the interpolated images are not really 12 megapixel images, but they do contain a bit more image information than the 6-megapixel image files generated by the S2's competition.

<b>Comparatively---S2 vs D100</b>

The S2 will most naturally be compared to the Nikon D100, given the similarities in price, size, and specifications between the two. Exposure compensation adjustments with the S2 are limited to � EV steps while the D100 exposure adjustments are controlled in 1/3 EV steps. The S2's the backlighted rear data display makes it very easy to check status/settings, and the four "soft" function buttons make it possible to change/adjust white balance, AF mode, image size, image quality, color, tone and sharpness settings---even in low light. Dual media slots (the S2 Pro accepts SmartMedia, Compact Flash (I&II), and IBM's huge capacity MicroDrives) make the S2 more versatile than its competition. The S2 has built-in support for both USB 1.1 and the much faster IEEE 1394 FireWire. The D100 has only USB 1.1 connectivity. 

<b>Viewfinder/LCD</b> 

SLR cameras (either digital or analog) have two major benefits that are not available with prosumer cameras, a TTL (through the lens) optical viewfinder (which provides a more accurate depiction of what the camera is seeing) and the ability to use interchangeable lenses.  The S2's TTL optical viewfinder has a small information display along the bottom of the screen that shows aperture, shutter speed, focus, etc. The S2's viewfinder display is virtually identical to the Nikon D100.

A 1.8-inch color LCD monitor on the back panel displays an image preview, histogram, and allows users to review captured images in Playback mode. For photographers who are used to Point & Shoot digital cameras, the LCD screens on digital SLR&#146s can't be used as a viewfinder, since they don&#146t provide a "live" display. The LCD screen is used only for image playback and menu access.
<b>Exposure </b>

The S2 Pro provides users with a full range of exposure control.  Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual modes work much like those options in other digital and analog SLR's. In Programmed Auto mode, the camera controls the shutter and aperture settings, but users can select from a range of equivalent exposure settings and adjust exposure compensation (-3 to +3 EV in � EV increments) which equates to a pretty impressive level of user input even in Programmed Auto mode.

<b>Metering</b>

The S2 provides three separate metering modes: 10-zone multi-pattern metering, center-weighted metering, and spot metering.  Overall, I found the S2's metering system a bit less sensitive than those in the Nikon D100 and the Canon D60.  For experienced photographers (who will bracket important exposures) this minor shortcomming will make little difference, but for less experienced photographers it may result in missed images.   

<b>Optics</b>

The Fuji Finepix S2 Pro uses Nikon&#146s venerable "F" mount.  The S2 will accept most Nikon mount lenses (AI and later) both manual and auto focus, but only AF "D" & "G" series Nikkors will provide all focus and metering options. In Manual focus mode, an indicator (a green dot, on the left-hand side of the viewfinder readout) lets you know when the S2's rangefinder thinks the focus is correct.

<b>Auto Focus</b>

In operation I didn't notice any quantifiable difference in auto focus performance and accuracy between the S2 Pro and Nikon D100.  I did all of my shooting with a 24-85mm AF-D Nikkor zoom---using other Nikkor or third party lenses may result in a slightly different outcome. 

<b>White Balance Options</b>

The S2 Pro provides a broader than average range of white balance options.  Auto, two Custom (manual) settings, Sunny, Shade, three Fluorescent (Daylight, Warm White, Cool White) settings, and Incandescent. The Incandescent setting is apparently balanced for studio lighting (3200K) so most indoor shots seem a bit warmer than normal. 

<b>Tone, Color, and Sharpness Options</b>

The S2's tone and color saturation settings are very well balanced and provide a really nice range of adjustments.  Sharpness settings (Standard, Hard, and Off) cover the range nicely.  My friend used the camera to make a gorgeous 8X10 enlargement and felt the S2's sharpness-off setting provided the most pleasing images---according to him the image files respond beautifully to unsharp masking in Photoshop. 

<b>Flash</b>

The S2 features a built-in flash and a hot shoe for more powerful external flash units. The multi mode built-in flash works very well and offers the full range of standard options: Auto, Redeye reduction, Redeye reduction with Slow Sync, Slow Sync, and Rear-Curtain Sync. 

The S2 (unlike the D100, which requires use of the SB-28 or SB-80) works well with a variety of Nikon dedicated flash units.  The S2&#146s maximum flash sync (1/125th of a second) is adequate for most situations, but somewhat slow by today's standards.

<b>File Storage</b>

One of my favorite things about the original S1 Pro was the dual media card slots.  The S2 Pro continues this useful tradition.  Photographers have the option to use SmartMedia Cards, Compact Flash cards, or IBM MicroDrives.   For file downloads the S2 Pro allows users to connect with USB 1.1 or faster FireWire (IEEE 1394), the D100 features only USB 
1,1.

<b>Power</b>

The S2 utilizes four AA batteries as well as two CR123A lithium batteries. Battery life is excellent, although the CR123A lithium cells will drain more quickly if you use the built-in flash a lot. (The AA cells run camera functions and the lithium cells run the flash.)

<b>Controls, Design,  & Ergonomics</b>

With the batteries loaded but no lens attached, the S2 is slightly heavier than the D100. The S2 is also a bit larger, overall, but the two cameras have a very similar balance and feel.  For photographers who are more comfortable with analog 35mm SLR's, the S2 retains a bit more of the N80&#146s personality and feel than does the D100.  The S2's operational layout and controls are logical and well thought out.  Long time photographers will feel right at home with the S2.  Camera operation is quick and efficient with the majority of  exposure options adjustable through the smaller rear panel LCD display and "soft" buttons.
   
<b>Creative Photography Options</b> 

The S2 has a really nifty Multiple Exposure Mode, which my friend and I wasted a lot of time playing with. You can overlay multiple exposures on the same image, and unlike 35mm SLR's, immediately see the results.  This is a surprising feature to find on a digital camera and it is really a lot of fun.  My friend said that "In terms of practicality, multiple exposures should be done with photoshop" but we both agreed that seeing the results immediately after shooting them was a lot more fun.

<b>In the Field/Handling & Operation</b> 

My friend (who sells digital and analog cameras and photography equipment has been trying to get his hands on a Fuji Finepix S2 Pro since July, when the camera was released.  He finally managed to borrow one for a few days so that we could check it out, and the weekend we planned to test the S2, it rained for the first time in two months.

We have been having a major drought here in Louisville all summer and we badly needed the rain, but it made my friend so mad he could hardly speak.  We spent a couple of hours Saturday familiarizing ourselves with the S2 Pros operation and controls, and shooting some color tests.  We always use the same set-up for out color tests, a homemade macro stage with a single light.  We shoot a selection of brightly colored children&#146s plastic beach toys against a white background.  The color tests turned out quite well, the S2&#146s color is very accurate. By the time we finished it was still raining and the sky was very dark and gloomy (and so was my friends mood).  I told him that I was going home, since we obviously were not going to take a $2300 camera out in the rain.  We agreed to get together Sunday morning and try again. 

Sunday morning was still dark and gloomy with lots of rain.  We drove to McDonalds and I had a cup of coffee while my friend ate.  We killed about an hour at Mickey Dees and when we came out the rain was gone and the sky was clearing.  We drove to Iroquois Park in Louisville's south end to shoot some nature and landscape images. The Park covers a large heavily forested hill that rises more than 800 feet above the surrounding suburbs. Once you are inside the park, it is quite easy to believe that you are "out in the country" rather than completely surrounded by a large metropolitan area. There is a small wildflower prairie with several diminutive marshy areas near the top of the hill. 

This quiet and serene hilltop refuge is home to a community of native Kentucky plants, wildflowers, and prairie grasses.  Old growth trees surround the little hilltop prairie.  The long drought has been very hard on this area.  Usually, the prairie is a photographer&#146s paradise, especially in the spring, early summer, and fall when the area sports dozens of varieties of colorful seasonal wildflowers.  It's the perfect place to check out a new camera, even when you have to really look to find wildflowers and an interesting intimate landscape or two.  We did find some black-eyed Susans and one tiny patch of shooting star to photograph.  The S2 performed beautifully and we were able to get a few nice landscape shots too.

Overall, the S2's performance was really exceptional, easily competitive with Nikon&#146s D100 and Canon&#146s D30.  We printed a couple of 5X7 and one 8X10 out on an Epson Photo Stylus 785EPX when we got back to my friends, and they were just superb.  Both of us agreed that there was more detail and the color was slightly better in the images from the S2 than in similar images from our tests with the D100 and D30.  

<b>Shutter Lag/Timing</b>

The S2&#146s shutter lag/cycle/write to card times are about average for digital SLR&#146s (much faster than prosumer digital cameras) and comparatively, a bit slower than the timing of the NikonD100.  The S2&#146s buffer is quite large which really helps on shot to shot times.  

<b>Image Quality</b>

Image quality is the single most important consideration when assessing the merits of any professional imaging device and the S2's images are consistently excellent.  In six-megapixel mode the S2 easily keeps up with the competition, clearly surpassing the D100 and D60 in overall resolution.  In twelve-megapixel mode the results are awesome, especially after some careful post exposure processing in Photoshop. 
 
<b>A Few Concerns</b>

The S2 is a hybrid, half digital and half N80 film camera. Four AA batteries power digital functions and the rest of the S2&#146s operations are powered by two non-rechargeable CR123 type batteries. Nikon offers the MB-D100 battery pack/portrait grip option for the D100, but the S2 doesn't offer a portrait grip option---a battery pack/portrait grip would have provided a vertical shutter release (very nice to have) and a better power solution. Battery life is one of the biggest concerns for digital camera consumers and using two different types of battery complicates the problem.  Fuji should have listened to consumer complaints about the S1&#146s battery complexity and simplified power options in the S2 Pro---with an optional battery pack/portrait grip.
 
<b>Conclusion </b>

There have been three exciting new digital SLR cameras released over the past few months and if you're in the market for a digital SLR the deciding which one to buy may be very difficult, especially for purchasers who are already invested in the Nikon system.  For Canon users the selection process will be a bit easier, but for consumers with a bag full of Nikkor lenses--- deciding between the Nikon D100 and the Fuji Finepix S2 Pro is going to be tough.  My friend and I agreed that we would both choose the S2 over either the D100 or the D30, but for many consumers the choice won't be so easy.
