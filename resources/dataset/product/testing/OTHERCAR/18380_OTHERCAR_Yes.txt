            I am currently leasing a 1998 black Hyundai Tiburon.  After my initial excitement, I wasn't sure how much I was going to enjoy my three year lease because our local dealer unexpectedly stopped carrying Hyundai and refused to do any service (if needed) on the car.  The closet dealership would now be two hours away.  I was very apprehensive that something would go wrong with the car and it would be a hassle, but I could not have been more wrong!  It has been almost two years on my lease and my Tiburon has performed beautifully in all areas....not even a pesky rattle!  It is a wonderful car to take on vacations because although it is small, when the back seat is folded down it actually holds more stuff than our 4 door Dodge Stratus.  Also, it is a very sharp car to drive...and there are not many on the road.  People are always stopping me in parking lots to ask me about my car.  It definitely is an attention getter, if that's what you're after!  (And incidentally, a new Hyundai dealership has recently opened up in town!)<br><br>
