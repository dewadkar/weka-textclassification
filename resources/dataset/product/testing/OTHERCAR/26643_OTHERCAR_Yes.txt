             I bought this car about 6 months ago from a friend of mine after some f#cking retarded teenaged b!tch rammed into my other car totalling it. (And she WAS a f#cking retarded b!tch!)

 After getting the car,, the first thing I noticed is that the brakes won't lock up. This feature takes a lot of getting used to because with the ABS system the brakes kinda do thier own thing to stop the car. It seems like the thing takes forever to stop. The good point to it all is that in snow,, the thing brakes very good. Another down side to the brakes is that they're four wheel disk brakes. It seemed to cost me quite a bit to replace them because when the fronts go,, the backs go right along with them unlike drum brakes which seem to last next to forever in comparison (so it seems)

  The interior of the car is great. The seats are comfortable and the overall ride is smooth. The seats recline and are comfortable enough that I've camped in my car instead of setting up a tent because of it. I found that this car is one that if I had to, I could live in the thing! The nice thing about that is if I get too drunk while at the bar,, I can crash out until I'm able to drive without getting a DUI.

 The car handles really good in all conditions. The ride is very smooth. The speedometer is digital and easy to read.

The radio is a bit weird because it's in two pieces. The reciever is in one place and the tape player is down below separate. It made it hard to get the kit to put my own system in. I will say, for a factory system,, the thing wasn't as bad as it could be. 

 The engine in this thing rocks! I haven't been able to completely reach top speed,, but so far I made it to 112 mph going up a grade on the freeway and still rising until I noticed traffic was slowed up ahead and had to slow down. If it can do that well uphill,, I wonder what the sucker can do going downhill! 

 I've had cooler looking cars,, but this one isn't as bad as it could be. I could be driving a Yugo or some other gay car. I'd have to say from past experience that Buicks are reliable cars,, I just hope this one holds out for a while.
