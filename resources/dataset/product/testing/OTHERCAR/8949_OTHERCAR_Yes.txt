            I first leased this vehicle for 30 months and planned to 
return it at the end because the payoff was so high (over $20k).
They called as the lease was ending and offered around
$7k less, which was an excellent deal.  This is a tough and
reliable vehicle.  Here is a sum-total of maintenance and
repairs since I first took delivery (new):

1.  oil changes every 3-6 k miles
2.  new tires at 65k miles ($250)
3.  clutch master and slave cylinders replaced at
78k miles ($420).
4.  windshield replacement ($200 deductible)

Interesting story on the clutch repair.  When the clutch went
out, I barely rolled into a Firestone repair shop a block away.
They told me the clutch and both cylinders were shot and said
that it would cost me $2200!  I thought this was ridiculous and
brought it to a nearby Isuzu dealer.  They told me the clutch was
fine, just the cylinders needed replacing and that even if the
clutch needed replacement, the whole job would be around
$1000 (still very high for a clutch but much better than the estimate).  What a relief.  

Anyway, this vehicle is robust.  I've gone 4 wheeling many times
through the mountains of New Mexico, frequently driving up to
the ski slopes in treacherous conditions.  Haven't kept up with
the across the board maintenance as well as I should have.
It's a good all-around car.
