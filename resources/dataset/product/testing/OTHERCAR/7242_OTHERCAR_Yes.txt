            I looked at many different types of cars before I finally decided on my '99 Cougar. I knew I wanted a sport car, but what did I want? Well price was a big factor. I got my Cougar nicely loaded for around $18,000. Most other cars I looked at were either a little over $20,000, or it didn't have everything I wanted. The feel of the ride in this car is so surprisingly smooth. I almost always have people comment on how smooth the ride is inside the car. 

The looks also greatly influenced my decision. The Cougar is a very unique looking car (well other than the new Eclipse that kinda looks like a 3000GT/Cougar hybrid). I still to this day get looks of amazement and wonder from people that have never seen this car before (are these people Amish??). Over the year and 25,000 miles I have driven my car, I have had only one semi-significant problem (&quot;check engine&quot; light malfunction), that was taken care of in less than one day. 

This car has great zip and more surprise features than you can shake a stick at. I recommend going to your local dealer to take a test drive today.<br><br>
