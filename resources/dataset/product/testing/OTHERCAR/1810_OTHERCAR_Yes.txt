            I am proud to say that I am now the owner of a 2001 Dodge Durango.  I bought this SUV for me.  I wanted something new, reliable, and nice.  This SUV is the perfect one for anyone who wants an SUV that isn't cramped, but isn't huge.  The Durango is right in the middle.  I bought the XLS package, and I am very satisfied.  I can not believe all the features that I got for such a small price.  I could have easily paid $40,000.00 on a 4-Runner with the same options.  The leather is excellent quality.  It has a built in electronic onboard computer with all the car's stats.  It even tells you how many miles you get to the gallon when you are driving!  The seats are incredibly comfortable.  There is lots of storage space including a low deck in the back.  You can order it with 5 or 7 seats.  It has an excellent air conditioner and many other features.  Dodge has come out with a long line of impressive colors for the Durango.  Mine has a silver exterior and a black leather interior.  The wood dash is very impressive, although the plastic on the dashboard is cheaply made.  The car as a whole runs excellent.  It turns sharp corners easily and has great pickup.  I am very satisfied with this SUV and if you are looking for a midsize SUV I strongly urge you to check out this one.  You can customize one online right now at www.4adodge.com.  Have Fun!<br><br>
