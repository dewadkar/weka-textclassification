                 I bought a used Corolla many years ago and it was an absolute joy to own.  It got excellent gas mileage and required virtually no repairs during the three years I drove it.  The interior was made of the highest quality materials I have ever seen in its price range.  The stock stereo system was also superior to other subcompacts.  Even the exterior paint was of excellent quality.  A magazine once called this car a "baby lexus," and i couldn't agree more.
     The driving experience can best be described as utilitarian.  The ride was a bit firm but not enough to make it uncomfortable.  On the contrary, it made the car feel light and nimble when maneuvering through traffic and parking.  The drivetrain was not especially stirring.  The engine produced adequate power, but did not really encourage "spirited" driving.  My car was equipped with a 4-speed automatic.  This transmission did not help the car accelerate (as compared to the 5-speed manual), but it was relatively smooth and rarely seemed to get caught in the wrong gear.  Additionally, the front wheel drive layout made for excellent handling poor weather - I never felt the need to buy snow tires.  Overall, while it lacked excitement, the strength of the engine and transmission was in its ability to provide tens of thousands of miles of trouble-free operation.
      When it comes to repairs, I never had any major problems with this car.  The exhaust manifold developed a crack necessitating replacement, but that can be considered normal wear.  However, the power window mechanisms in both of the front doors broke, requiring relatively expensive replacements from the dealer.  All of these things were slightly inconvenient, but not serious problems that prevented me from using the car.
      Overall, I would say that this is the ideal car for anyone who doesn't want to have to think about their car.  It will run forever and cost very little.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is on a tight budget, such as a college student, who needs dependable transportation.
