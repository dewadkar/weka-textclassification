            After an extensive search over two weeks, I bought this camera via the Internet with an additional 32MB Flashcard.  I wanted an above average camera for capturing photos for selling stuff on EBAY and for when I only needed a picture or two of something.  The camera has been able to shoot everything I hoped for, but there are some drawbacks, although I consider them minor.

ONLY use Duracell ultra batteries.  Standard alkaline batteries will die faster than a stepped on bug.  If you turn the camera on and don't shoot the picture in about 30 seconds, the monitor shuts down and does not always come back on (In this case, turn off the camera &amp; turn it back on).  Also, because the camera uploads its images through the serial port on your PC, it is a little slow.  But I only do this 1-3 times in a two week period.  There is an adaptor if you require faster uploads (for about $55.00).

Overall, love it!  It is Nikon to the core.<br><br>
