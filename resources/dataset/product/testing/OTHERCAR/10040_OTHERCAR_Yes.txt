            We  bought a 2000 Kia Sephia about 10 months ago and are very happy about this decision.  In the past ten years we have had two chevy cavaliers that we found to be comfortable and good economy cars. We did have the problem of them overheating, which is the reason that we were out looking for a new car. As much as we found the cavaliers to be comfortable and economical, the Kia Sephia surpasses both in comfort and economy. The Kia is also very driveable. My husband and I are both large and there is plenty of legroom and all over room.This is true for both the front and back seats. The seatbelts are adjustable  and provide protection for all sizes, which is difficult for the larger population. And the seatbelts are adjustable so they wouldn't cut into your neck if you are short.
 Our average gas mileage with the air conditioner on is 24mpg and without the air on is 30 mpg. 
  Some other positive factors that we like are the latches for the gas tank,trunk and hood being inside the car. I also like the light inside the trunk that is very handy when unloading groceries,etc. after dark,
 We did have minor problems with overheating, which was taken care of very quickly and effectively There has been no problem with the overheating since. Also the molding around the front passenger door was loose and that was  quickly fixed.<br><br>
