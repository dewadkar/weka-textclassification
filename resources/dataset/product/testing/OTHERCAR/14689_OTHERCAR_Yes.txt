            I only owned Toyotas for the past 20 years.  I decided I wanted an SUV and test drove the Rav4 and the Forester.  There was not comparison and I was shocked to find that the Forester was a much smoother and more comfortable ride then the Rav4.  Needless to say I purchased the 1999 Forester and I am very happy with it.  It rides remarkably like a regular car and does not sit too high up for me.  The seating is very comfortable, the ride smooth and the look of the vehicle is very pleasing.
I was very apprehensive in changing from the tried and proven Toyota that I waw used to but I am not disappointed that I changed to the Subaru.

Having been a loyal owner of Toyotas for so long, it was a real challenge for me to convince myself to change, but the test drive is what convinced me to convert.  I am not disappointed at all that I made this decision.<br><br>
