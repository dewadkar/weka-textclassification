            No here is the real deal people! This is the car f the fututre! If you want to buy a car that is samml, comfortable and cheap, this is the car you should get!When Mazda replaced the 323 sedan with the Protege in 1990, it introduced a sporty element to the typical Japanese compact sedan. The new car's
 suspension gave it sportier handling than the previous car or those from
Honda and Toyota. In LX trim, the engine had dual overhead cams and a
 nice set of alloy wheels. The sheetmetal, with its crease a few inches belowthe beltline and tapered C-pillar, deliberately resembled a Mercedes E-Class on a smaller scale. The overall effect was slightly Germanic. Not
surprisingly, Mazda for many years was the best-selling Japanese brand in
Germany. I recommend the lX version because it is somewhere between ES and DX but still awesome. Highly reommned!<br><br>
