            I got lucky and snagged one the day after they were released from an out-of-the-way shop. I opened the box, and started reading the user guide while the battery charged (about 90 minutes). I have an F100, which is a good starting point for familiarity with the controls--but JUST a starting point! This camera has abilities I will be learning in 5 years. I have shot action at 8 fps JPEG, closeups in RAW-NEF, and night shots at 3200 ISO. The resolution on this sucker is great -- much better than the 4.1 mps would suggest. The Nikon Capture/View software included is a little hinky at first, but once you get it, very simple and direct. I was adjusting white balance, increasing and decreasing EV's, and fine tuning contrast and color in minutes. The color balance between my screen and the Epson 2200 seems pretty close out of the box! In my first real day of shooting in the big snowstorm, I got 8 or 10 keepers that could have been printed at the best pro lab. (My wife is a senior art expert for a major auction house, and up until yesterday never saw a digital picture she liked. Even she is sold.) 

I waited for a camera that could roll up 30-40 sports shots in its buffer, and had the capability to go to "art" photography. With my 2GB CF card, I'm getting well over 300 RAW, or 1700 JPEG NORM shots -- a lot more than 1 day's work for me.I can follow a horse around the jumping ring and shoot the entire round without needing a second body or to reload (no time anyway!). The max speed looks like a movie, and is great for analyzing form and performance, than erasing and starting over! My Hi res shots are crisper than film, with depth and nuance that can be easily enhanced on the screen, not through 5 hours in the darkroom pulling my hair out.

If you want a SERIOUSLY cool and functional piece of technology that can be used at any level of proficiency, this would be it for me.
