            I bought this vehicle when my other car broke down.  I chose the LHS because of the safety I felt immeditialy when I drove it.  With it's large build and beautiful contures it is a hard car not to notice.  

I love this vehicle for it's interior!  The leather is wonderful and the seats are really comfy!  There are so many options (like the milage counter, and the &quot;doo-hicky&quot; that tells you how far you have left until you run out of gas.)  I don't like the quality of paint job, however.  I have had this car for 4 years, and already some of the paint is peeling off.  I can't say for sure if it's the manufactures fault, or something I did and don't remember.  When there is something wrong with it, the engine is so compact that it makes for an expensive repair bill.

The LHS has a super nice ride.  It's so smooth you sometimes forget that you are driving.  The seats adjust to every way possible, so it's hard not to be comfortable!  When I drive it I have a hard time not speeding.  It's so easy to!

People with children should buy this car, or anyone who travels by car a lot.  It seats 6 eaisly and the trunk has huge storage space!  I'm not really sure who shouldn't buy this car.<br><br>
