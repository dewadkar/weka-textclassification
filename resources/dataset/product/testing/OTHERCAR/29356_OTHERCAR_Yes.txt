            Hi, I bought my car new in 1998 and it has been a nice vehicle to drive every day.  I like the fact that I am sitting up a little higher than a normal car, but not up so high as one of those &quot;monster trucks&quot; that a lot of the sport utility vehicles have become.  I do have one concern though ... I got a class action settlement notice in the mail for transmission problems that apparently occurred WHEN TOWING behind a recreational vehicle.  While I have not towed the car behind it, occasionally my car feels funny when I drive it ... I just haven't had a chance to take it in to the dealer yet.

By the way, I have used the cute little picnic table several times ... and my friends and I laugh each time we use it!<br><br>
