            I as many other people who bought cameras for the internet selling and advertising craze bought the entry level Sony FD-73, which was a fine camera and served the purpose early on soon started to flounder when the higher resolution cameras started coming out. People who would post the same article for sale started losing out to the people who could provide a better looking picture. Well needless to say this just was not cutting it for me, so I started looking for a digital camera which would give me the edge. After about 2 months of research 2 things stood out most of all for me. I needed a camera with high resolution and the convenience of still using a floppy disk. High resolution on the MVC-FD95, is 1600X1200 and the low is 640X480. These ranges were more than sufficient for my needs. The floppy disk was also a must since most USB camera are a pain to set up and slow to download.

The following is very important, any camera you buy that has manual features YOU MUST READ THE INSTRUCTION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE FUNCTIONS WORK. If you do not your pictures will not come out the way you expected. Why do you say, because I came close to jumping to hasty conclusions when I first started using my MVC-FD95, without reading the instructions and started getting picture quality no better than with my FD-73, then I reading the instruction first for those features which I needed to get better picture quality and then later for special enhancements the results were very rewarding and I soon came to praise this awesome camera and it's many feature capabilities. My sales started to increase on ebay the number of hits I was getting sky rocketed. I was so pleased that the cost of the camera started looking like a bargain.

Last thing I would like to say is that this camera is fantastic for still pictures. The video feature in 
this camera is limited to a low resolution and a short viewing time. It's nice to play with, but do not expect this camera to be a camcorder. If you want a good solid camera for still pictures this is it. If you want the video aspect more you better look into buying a camcorder.
