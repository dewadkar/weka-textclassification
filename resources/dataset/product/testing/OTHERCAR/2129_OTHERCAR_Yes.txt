            If you are considering a 93 or 94 Dodge Spirit with the six cylinder, ignore this review and do NOT purchase the car.  All of the sixes had the Chrysler A-604 4 speed automatic transmission, a transmission that Chrysler has a &quot;silent&quot; warranty on because it fails in less than 80,000 miles.  If, however, you are considering one of these models with the 2.5L four, read on.  This model came with a 3-speed auto.  Not very technically advance, but it is bulletproof, as well as the rest of the car.  It has held up over time better than either one of my brother's Hondas

I bought mine off lease in 95 for about half the sticker price.  It had 50,000 miles on the clock.  As of Jan 2001 I still own the car, and it has 182,000.  The only thing that I have had to replace is the gasoline in the tank and maintenance parts as outlined in the owner's manual.

This is just a great car.  No, it doesn't ride the best, doesn't get the best gas mileage, isn't the most stylish, nor is it the fastest.  But it doesn't ride bad, isn't a gas hog, isn't ugly, and isn't slow.  

Pros: The 2.5L four is quick for a base engine and the 3 speed auto shifts smoother than most new electronic overdrive units.  The interior is logically laid out.  The light switch is, of all thinks, a single pull out knob (some things cannot be improved on).  The back seat is roomy for the total size of the car.  The driving position is very comfortable.  The base factory stereo sounds great.  When it comes to upkeep, there are so many Chrysler products built with the same parts that the parts are incredibly cheap.  I bought front brake rotors for under $20 a piece.  The pads were almost given to me.  If you are going to run a car forever like I do, this is a consideration, isn't it?

Cons:  The windshield washers are built into the wiper arm.  This design was all the rage in the early 90's but isn't used anymore because it doesn't work well at all.  The headlights don't work as well as they should.  The radio does not have a &quot;scan&quot; or &quot;seek.&quot;

Hints:  Put good tires on the car.  The car had cheap tires on it when purchased and the car rode like a log wagon.  I put Goodyear Regattas on all four corners and the ride drastically improved.  I got 85,000 miles out of those tires also (another subject entirely).

In summary, a car that I am very happy with and wouldn't trade for a new one.  <br><br>
