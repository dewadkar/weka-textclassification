            I bought a 1996 Saab SE Turbo (5 door, which counts the hatchback) in Dec. of '97.  At the time I really wanted the Audi A4, but found that it was just too small for me.  I needed something to be able to put a person in the rear seats and at 6' 2&quot; I found there was no room in the back of the Audi at all.  The Saab has a more room back there, but still not a lot.
I've put about 40,000 miles on the car (total miles are 65,000 now), I know it's a lot - but hey I commute in Los Angeles, so I've spent a LOT of time in the car.

Overall I really like it, it's got power, unique style, and suprisingly great gas mileage.  I average about 27 mpg.
In addition the trunk is spacious and the rear seats can be folded down for even more room (I've only needed to do it once though).  The stereo is good and the trip computer is interesting, but to be honest I almost never use it other than to see the temperature or mpg.  But it will track distance to empty, miles travelled, can set an alarm to notify when you are going too fast, etc.  The heated seats are nice, and it does occassionally get cold enough to use them here.  I also like the power adjustments on the seats, which allow me to really customize the position to me (and has 3 memory settings to hold that position).

What don't I like?  Well, routine maintenance is a bit expensive - dealerships charge about 250-500 depending on if it's a major or minor service (65,000 was a major service milestone).  I have had to replace the clutch, not unexpected considering the amount of rush hour driving (it's manual).  I also recently replaced the water pump and front brake pads.  For the miles I put on I don't consider this to be out of the ordinary.
The biggest/only complaint I have are a couple annoying rattles.  One from the right passenger air vent and one from the mirrors adjustment on the drivers side.  I am also noticing some problems with the windshield sprayers, seems they aren't putting out enough power lately even though the water resevoir is full.  And the cost for maintenance, but that only occurs every 10,000 miles.
