            I bought this vehicle because it was recommended to me. when i went to the car dealership, it was love at first site. The toyota camry is a beautiful car inside and out. It drives very smoothly, and it very reliable. i've had it for over a year now, and there hasn't been one problem with it. It's roomy enough to fit both of my teenage boys in the back, with plenty of room for horsing around. Also, i have noticed that the A/C is exceptional in this car. I can cool down or heat up in a matter of minutes. it's wonderful. For an inexpensive luxury car, go for the toyota camry!
