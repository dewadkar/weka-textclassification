                 My first sports car was a 1964 1/2 Mustang. It was and still is a disappointment.  I really don't understand all the &quot;mystique&quot; about them.  It has always held a place in my mind as a good looking Falcon.   Over the next 35 years I have owned dozens of Real Sports Cars, ie; XKE, Lotus, Alfa, Austin Healy, Lancia, Mercedes, and Porsche.                 Each marque has its own character and attributes.  The first Alfa I owned handled much in the same way as the new ones.  I am not saying &quot;exactly&quot;, but characteristically similar.  The Alfa is a very nimble, responsive vehicle.  When I drove the GTV, even with my eyes closed, I could feel it was an Alfa.  I really didn't drive with my eyes closed.  If you are looking to impress someone, go buy a Miata, Corvette, or an SLK.  If you are going to drive during rush hour, get an Urban Tank.  If you really enjoy driving, and you can appreciate the unique feel of an Alfa, you will form a lasting need to have another.  Since I need two types of autos, one to get someplace in, and one for recreation, my sports car does not supply utility transportation.  The parts and service in my locality are sub-par, so I would not rely on the for daily driving.           <br><br>
