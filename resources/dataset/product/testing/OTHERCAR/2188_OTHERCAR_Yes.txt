            The Toyota corolla is a car that possess the necessary parts to make this one of the most pleasurable cars to drive.  It provides a smooth drive with great handling and with little noise.  At only about $12,000 you could expect to pay more for such a car.  It proforms well in all conditions and is very easy on the gas budget.  I have seen these cars get up to 40 miles to the gallon on the highway.  That is about the best that you will find.  The only down side is for the taller people in the population.  This car can be a little tight for some people.  The seats do adjust but it can really start to crowd the back seat.  This car is a good car because it combines the great handling of a sports car and the great gas milage of the small car with a very durable car.  Don't expect to have to take it in to the shop to much.<br><br>
