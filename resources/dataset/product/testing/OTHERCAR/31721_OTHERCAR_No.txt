            We bought our 1993 Dodge Intrepid in 1996 when it was a few years old and had around 65,000 miles on it.  We bought this vehicle because it is very sporty looking, yet it had a lot of room for our two kids and ourselves to fit comfortably in this car.  Everything ran smoothly the first three years, until it hit 100,000 miles.  This was like a scene out of Cinderella, when the clock struck 12:00 Midnight, Cinderella's nice carriage turned into a pumpkin.  The same thing happened to our car when it hit 100,000 miles.  We may as well have been driving a pumpkin, because it probably would've had less problems.  The problems started when the computer went on our car, along with the oxygen sensors.  That put us back about $2,100.00.  Eight months later we had fuel problems that the mechanics couldn't detect and our car was in the shop 4 or 5 times until they finally fixed the problem.  Another $500.00.  We spent $2,600.00 in eight months trying to fix our car, not to mention that we've had numerous other problems with this vehicle, and we kept sinking money into it.  We finally got smart and bought a newer Chevrolet Blazer and our Dodge Intrepid is sitting in our front yard with a FOR SALE sign on it (waiting for some poor sap to take this vehicle off our hands).  

The sad thing is that we still owe on this vehicle and we will be taking a loss, but that loss will be worth it (lack of frustration and we won't be dumping any more money into this car).

I don't know if this car was made so poorly because it was the first year that it was made, but from what I've heard from other 1993 Dodge Intrepid owners, I wasn't the only one that bought a lemon!

I will say that when this vehicle is running well, it's a nice smooth, roomy ride.  But, that smooth ride is not worth all the hassles and the money that go hand in hand with this car

Please, please, avoid this vehicle at all costs!
