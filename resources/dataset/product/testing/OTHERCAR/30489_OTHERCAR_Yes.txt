            My father just bought an '89 Toyota Corolla, and I must say I love it. These cars last forever. The mileage is quite high 150,000, the body is in perfect condition, and everything inside and out works perfectly. To top it off, it was only $2,000. There are two things I absolutely love about it. One, is the brilliant gas mileage it gets, approximately 30-35 mpg(give or take depending on the year and what not). Two, these last forever. It is up there in reliability with the Tucker 48. The body rusts before the car will break (provided it's treated kindly). I definitely recommend this car, for anyone. Well, except, maybe soccer moms :)<br><br>
