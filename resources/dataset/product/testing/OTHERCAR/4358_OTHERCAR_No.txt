            I read many reviews that stated good things about this car.  What is the color of the sky your living in ......mine is blue.

Since my wife and I purchased this car two years ago, with just at 30,000 miles, it has spent many of nights at the local dealership for repairs and has been in for service and recalled over TEN TIMES!!

Maybe most people think that is okay for an american made car to break down often to help support the income of service techs but I will be the first one in line at my local Nissan/Toyota dealer in a year and a half when this Mercury Mistake is paid off (if it last that long).

I like the way it looks, drives and I even like the MPG but the car has more problems with the electrical system and so on that it can never be rated a reliable car.  I have had so many problems with this car we have had it in for recalls where they repaired electrical items from the A/C blower switch to the air bag sensor.  To trim work wheer they replaced the carpet, new seat tracks and my entire dash!

If your reading this and you have not yet made the mistake in purchasing this type of car ... please run away from it!<br><br>
