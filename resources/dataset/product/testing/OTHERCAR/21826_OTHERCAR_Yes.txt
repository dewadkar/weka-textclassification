            I have been following the automotive adjustments and improvements made to the Nissan Maxima for a while, ever since the first time I rode in one. I remember thinking that the car had an exceptional ability to convey power and acceleration all the while maintaining a quiet, smooth ride. And please bear in mind, this was years ago when the car was still touting its 3.0L 190hp V-6. And things have only gotten better.

Power:

Lets face it. The large majority of cars that you see on the road that are the size of a Maxima handle more like a boat than a sports car. However, most cars in this passenger class weigh about 200-300 lbs. more total curb weight than a Maxima. I was thoroughly impressed when Nissan improved the horsepower of its popular 3.0L V-6 from 190 to 222 three years ago, dressing it up with an improved 5-speed and 17" wheels and performance tires for the SE. This year they have pushed the envelope further and left the competition even more frustrated with a veritable street shredding 3.5L 255 horsepower V-6! Also bear in mind this car has excellent torque as well, 246 ft.-lbs. @ 4400rmps, and is completely normally aspirated. Which means no turbo lag. Think what it would do if it DID have a turbo or a supercharger!

A car with a total curb weight of about 3200 lbs. utilizes this kind of power with considerable voracity. Even though it is a FWD auto, which is less desirable than RWD for a car this powerful, it feels sporty. The now standard 17" wheels with V-speed rated tires grip well, and even though you will feel a little of the torque steer inevitable with a powerful FWD car, if you enjoy off-the-line acceleration the way I do you won't mind. Nissan leaves its 4-door sedan competitors in the dust with Maxima, literally.

Handling:

This car will surprise you, especially in SE trim with the sport-tuned suspension. Again, you sacrifice a little ride softness for some flat cornering and sporty handling behavior, but every car has trade-offs like this, you just have to gauge what matters more to you, riding on a cushion of goose down or ripping around corners like you are on rails. ;-) An exaggeration in both respects I know, but you get the idea.

The braking is top-notch, with 4-wheel discs with standard ABS and even electronic brake force distribution, which reports back to the car whether more braking force is needed in the front or the rear in emergency braking situations to help you come to the quickest and most controlled stop possible.

Styling:

The interior fit and finish of this car has only gotten better over the years, it is classy and modern, without trying to do too much. The stereo controls are fairly easy to master and having cruise controls and audio controls mounted on the steering wheel makes driving enthusiasts like myself giddy. 

The exterior styling is improved even from a year ago, with the cheap-looking blacked-in taillights going clear plastic which is so trendy right now, but is actually executed fairly well here. The new standard (yes, I said standard) Xenon headlamps are excellently executed, making the "eyes" of this car look very classy and luxurious, while the adjacent gaping air intake helps to remind you that this is a performance auto. The fog lamps are as fog lamps should be: big, round, positioned just right, under the headlight clusters. But there are still little things I would change, like the less-than-inspiring rear bumper; and the 17" wheels, though performance-ready to be certain, could LOOK a little more the part. But these are very minor gripes... ;-)

Overall:

In summing up the whole of this car, I can honestly say after test-driving it on numerous occasions, you will be very hard-pressed to match its build quality, power, and reliability for the money. You might have noticed a trend in the fact that Nissan seems amply concerned with giving its Maxima buyers the essential and sought-after amenities standard: 17" wheels and performance tires, Xenon lights, ABS, fog lamps, world-beating power, etc... For a realistic price. Nissan is definitely making a statement as of late. This all coming from an obsessive car fanatic that looks at spec sheets for virtually every new car more than once... :-)
