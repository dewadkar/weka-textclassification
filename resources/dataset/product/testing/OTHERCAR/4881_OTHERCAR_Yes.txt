            What can I say? This car is like the best car for the money. It's really sad to see that Infiniti decided to stop production of the G20 series. 

The first thing I noticed when I approached to this car, was that it didn't really have much style. It seemed a little bland. (Note: the 1999+ G20's looks much nicer.) 

When I got in the car however, that's a whole new story. The front leather bucket seats felt really nice and comfortable. It has dual power seats. The adjustable height for the steering wheel made my ride more comfortable. The center console is well laid out for easy access. Moonroof controls are simple to use. The pedals are spaced out nicely. However, the back seats could use a little room. You can only fit two full size adults back there. 

The driving part was the part that made me buy this car. I was at the first stoplight, I press the gas pedal lightly and it accelerated smoothly. The car ride is extremely smooth if you keep the car under 3000 rpm. It gives that luxury ride feeling, which is really sweet. Then I decided to let myself loose at the 2nd stoplight. Got myself prepared for a petal to the metal deal. When it was a go, I pushed full throttle, and oh my god, this car sounds beautiful at high revs. The 0-60 acceleration is around 8 to 9 seconds, which is pretty darn good. I pulled a hard corner at 40 mph, and the car handled perfectly. It didn't over steer or under steer! I was simply amazed on how this car handles! 

I've been keeping up with the recommended maintenance schedule, and the car is still running like new. I bought it at 40k miles and now have around 83k miles, and I haven't encountered any problems at all. 

Well, to sum it up, the car is simply amazing. It handles like a dream. It can be a luxury ride. It can also be a sporty ride. The interior is really nice. It's reliable, people have gotten these cars up to 200k+ and their cars still run like new! The exterior could use a little help, but acceptable. The power can be increased a little. Overall, this car is great! I'd probably give this car the "most value" award.
