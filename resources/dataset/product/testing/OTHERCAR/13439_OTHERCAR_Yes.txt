            2 weeks before my 16th birthday my parents made a 12000 dollar purchase of a 1992 isuzu trooper which happens to be the first year of the newer body style trooper. over the course of 2 years driving this trooper i have found this car to be perfect and acceptable for every situation possible. off road, social functions, pimpin, chillin with the boys, its strange to find out that everyone wants to ride in the &quot;troop&quot; whenever we go places. my recommendation for the trooper is mainly because i have been able to have so much fun driving a big car and feel good whatever car i pull up next to at a light, but also for a safety reason. i dont consider myself the greatest driver and i have been in 7 accidents in 2 years. the funny thing is that only 5 of these accidents required a car to be repaired, but only 1 of the 7 required my trooper to be repaired. out of my pocket i have payed to repair the damage i have caused to other vehicles, but as i rear end cars, back into cars and whatnot, never do i have to put my car in the shop because nothing ever happens to the trooper. the one exception is a case where the trooper probably saved my life. i was skipping school one day and in a turning lane, a mack truck turned from the center lane on a main road and destroyed the side of my car. the police and court ruled it as the other drivers fault and he was penalized, but the truck that hit me was a huge dumptruck filled with sand. the impact was directly at my driver side door and when the accident happened my window was down, and i had just left school and my seatbelt was off. i was not even jostled and my car hardly budged. my car was pushed to the side a few feet, but basically stopped the truck in its tracks. i couldnt get out of my driver door, so i hopped out the passenger door to get out and settle the accident and notify the police. i cant think of a vehicle you can do more in and still maintain a sense of ruggedness and luxury. the newer models are as plush and great looking as ever.<br><br>
