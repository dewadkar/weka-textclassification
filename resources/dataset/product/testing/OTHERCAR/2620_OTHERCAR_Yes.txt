            Before my surgeon cleared me to return to work, </I>I began an online investigation of new cars for Mrs. G.  There were lots of candidates.  Only a couple had enough potential to warrant a trip to a dealer.  Once driven, Toyota�s 2001 Avalon immediately jumped to the head of the class.  The Avalon comes in a standard XL model and a more luxurious XLS.  This opinion concentrates on the XLS.


<B>DISCLAIMER: Due to my recovery � closely followed by my Mother�s recent death � we have not gotten back to actually purchase our Avalon XLS as yet.  But we are planning to.
Over a five-week period, we took four different vehicles [from 3 different dealerships] on extensive test drives.  Keeping with the diversity for which this region is famous [or is it infamous]; one day was clear with sunshine, one overcast with a heavy rain falling, and one clear with 5" of snow on the ground.  Overall, a pretty good cross-section!</B>


<B>EXTERIOR</B>

Size:  With an overall length slightly over 191�, Avalon just qualifies as a full-size sedan.  Avalon is slightly less than 72� wide and should fit easily into most garages.  [Mrs. G had no problem maneuvering in tight places.]

Eye Appeal & Comfort:  Avalon is a full-size sedan.  Like most of that class, Avalon has modest curb appeal.  She is stylish enough but there is little visual that will arrest your eye in mid gaze.  [Frankly, head-turning looks are not high on our list of criteria for an automobile.]  The XLS looks quite comfortable whether at rest or in motion.

Color:  Avalon comes in seven exterior colors; Lunar Mist, Diamond White, Desert Sand, Vintage Red, Silver Spruce, Woodland, and Black.  [We saw all the combinations but kept coming back to the <I>�Silver Spruce�</I>.  <I>�Lunar Mist�</I> was our second choice.]


<B>INTERIOR</B>

Size:  The front dimensions are exceptional.  [Mrs. G could get up close with her short legs and I could doze comfortably with the passenger seat reclined].  I sat in back during two of our test drives.  I was equally comfortable seated behind the driver or passenger.  [Though I don�t think the center of the rear seat would be comfortable on a long trip.]

Eye Appeal & Comfort:  Even at first glance the Avalon appears restful and roomy.  The leather upholstery is soft and the stitching fine and true.  Both front seats are heated, had 8-way power adjustments, and power 2-way lumbar support.  [A real blessing on this scarred ole back!]  The dash has a simulated wood insert and an instrument display that is functional and pleasing to the eye.  [Mrs. G considers a compass and air temperature indication <I>�must haves�</I>.]  The steering wheel {with tilt adjustment} and floor-mounted gearshift knob are each leather-wrapped.  One really great feature is the split front air conditioning and climate control.  [Mrs. G and I can individually adjust to our comfort level.  There are also adjustable rear heat ducts.  The AM/FM system {with CD and Cassette} was grand and the seven speakers allowed wonderful sound distribution.

Color:  There are only three choices of interior color, Ivory, Stone, and Taupe.  Selection is further restricted by your exterior choice.  [We love the look of the <I>�Stone�</I> interior with a <I>�Silver Spruce�</I> body.]


<B>PERFORMANCE</B>

Engine:  A 3.0-liter [V6] is the only engine available.  The manufacturer claims it delivers 210 HP at 5800 RPM and provides 220 foot-pounds of torque at 4400 RPM.  She comes off a stoplight smartly and passed at highway speeds with ease.  [We found that it was nimble and responsive in city traffic and on the interstate.]

Control:  We took 4 different cars on the road.  [Mrs. G � a rather cautious driver � had the wheel twice.  I am a bit more {ahem} assertive and drove the other two.  Acceleration was rapid but smooth � no jerking.  The Avalon comes with anti-lock brakes.  Even on wet {or snow-covered} pavement we stopped quickly without fishtailing.


<B>SAFETY FEATURES</B>

Air bags, side air bags, and side impact protection are on both the XL and XLS.  Variable-speed, intermittent wipers are standard.  Also included are 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and halogen headlights with daytime running lights.

The XLS adds additional front fog/running lights, heated outside mirrors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a well-developed security system.

Toyota offers enhanced Vehicle Skid Control {a combination of stability and traction control} as an option.  [None of the cars we drove were so equipped.]
