            I own a 1997 Acura Integra LS and so far so good. The main reason I bought this car was for its undisputed reliability and good reviews (both from various car magazines and personal opinions from friends). The handling of the car is above average and the engine provides more than adequate power. The trunk provides ample space and the dash controls are logical and easy to reach. So far I have had no mechanical problems with the car (*knock on wood*) but I did have one minor problem with the moonroof getting jammed because of a broken lock peg. I just got it replaced since it was still under warranty.

The front seats can be a little cramped if you are a taller person. I'm about 6 feet tall and if I push the seat all the way back, I'm pretty comfortable although my knees occasionally hit the steering wheel. I can't imagine taller people being too comfortable driving this car. The only other thing that bothers me is that the body seems to be very prone to little dents and &quot;dings&quot;. Perhaps, I'm just very unlucky and keep parking next to people who aren't very careful about opening their doors or getting bombarded with rocks and debris on the freeway that may be causing the dents. I'm not sure but I know I have a some noticeable ones on the passenger side doors. 

If you are looking for a sporty car in the low to mid range $20k's then consider getting this car. It's well worth it (unless you're really tall in which case you may consider an SUV or some other larger car).
