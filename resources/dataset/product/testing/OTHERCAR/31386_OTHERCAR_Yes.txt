            I have bought Oldsmobiles since the 1980's, and always been satisfied.  My wife needed a new car for work.  The Axle on her Chrysler Le Baron broke. We went to a local Oldsmobile dealer.  We checked out the lot.  We were looking for a mid-sized, safe vehicle, which would be fun to drive. We settled on a 1999 Alero.  It is loaded with extras.  She has a sun roof for warmer times of the year.  There is a spoiler bar for sharp turn balance; and the head lights turn themselves on and off.  This is done by a sensor.  She has her choice of an AM-FM radio, a cassette tape deck, and a CD player.  The car is a veritable symphony on wheels.  The real proof of the pudding is that when we had our first icy and snowy day recently, she drove to work before the road crews plowed and salted.  She reported complete traction.  She feels very comfortable on highways, residential streets, and dirt roads a like.  During the test drive we took, prior to buying the car, I insisted she try it out on all different types of roads. I also wanted her to ask the salesman how to operate every switch button and knob.  He was very patient, informative, and pleasant.  Oldsmobile trains its sales people very well.  We were not hassled about price.  I made a firm offer of invoice plus $300 (plus sales tax).  I told them that was what I needed to close the deal.  They accepted my offer the first time, without any hidden charges, or irritating dickering.  I bought a new Oldsmobile Cierra in 1997, and have it serviced at this dealership, so they know me.  My wife is in her second childhood with this sporty car.  That pleases me no end.                         <br><br>
