            Let me first say that it pains me to write a negative review of a VW product.  I love the New Beetle and everything about its design.  However, it has become a money pit to own and I regret purchasing it.  At less than 40,000 miles the oil pan has cracked, the water pump has gone bad, various temp sensors have failed.  The overall ride has deteriorated to the point of being unpleasant to drive.  At less than 5,000 miles the radio died, the Instrument Cluster needed to be replaced, various knobs broke off, every piece of interior plastic is peeling, the VIN# decal is bubbling, there are countless rattles and squeaks.  The brakes needed to be replaced after 10,000 miles, the battery died in the first year at 10:00 PM in the dead of winter.  Nothing feels as bad as being stranded when you have a new car.  The hood is a magnet for stones and road debris...the windshield is also a target.  
The car was fun for about a year, and now is less reliable than my 1994 Jetta with 140k miles on it.  Needless to say, I would only recommend purchasing a Beetle if you are a patient person, more concerned with form than function, and want to know your dealer's service staff on a first name basis.  Also, I now feel like a tool because people warned me not to buy a Beetle due to numerous problems and bad reliability.  I have never had problems with any VW product so I brushed off the warnings...the Beetle is one of those cars that people either love or hate.  I have also received three separate notices to join class action lawsuits against VW for complaints against window regulators failing, and alternators going bad.  I am not alone in how I feel...I cannot wait to trade this car in for something more reliable and more comfortable.
