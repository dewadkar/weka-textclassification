            UPDATE after *********** 



My family recently relocated and it wasn't worth the cost of transporting our second car, so my plan was to buy a "new" one in our new location.  I never thought I would buy a new car ... they are so expensive and the value drops so drastically in the first year (etc., etc.).  Then I started seeing the Sephia on the road and saw an ad (offering the basic 2000 Sephia for $8995).  The type of used car I wanted would've cost me at least that much ... and it would be about 5 years old with no warranty.  I figured a new car with the warranty was a smarter move (a decision made with the brain and not the heart ... go figure).

The longer I own this car, the more I like it.  It maneuvers wonderfully, handles great on the highway, gets great gas mileage, shifts cleanly and easily (standard shift) and I've folded the rear split-fold seat more than once (a feature I wish my Taurus had).  I remember driving down the highway and thinking, "this really doesn't handle too good at higher speeds", then I realized I was going 95mph!  I definitely took my foot off the accelerator and started paying more attention at that point!  I have been impressed with the amount of trunk space ... it's smaller than my Taurus ... but then again this is considered a compact and the Taurus is considered a mid-size.  Seeing the two cars side-by-side in the driveway, I realize that almost the only difference in size is probably the trunk!  My 6'9" husband "fits" well enough to drive when necessary (he doesn't fit in very many vehicles ... including most SUVs).  I've been in many compact cars (newer and older) and have been impressed at how the interior "feels".  Yes, the headliner is vinyl, but the seats don't feel like cardboard (like my old '84 Lynx and a friends older Saturn).

I sometimes wish I could've afforded a van (what I really wanted), my husband, child and a couple of friends could all still go somewhere together ... in one vehicle, but then again, no car can do that!

I've had to watch how I shift ... about 50% of the time I hit my elbow on the console when shifting from 1st to 2nd.  The cover inside the trunk is not tacked down in any way, so when you push stuff in and pull stuff out it tends to shift around.  Otherwise, I've driven this car for over 5k miles and can't think of anything that I don't like about it!

This car was a great decision for my family.  I work part-time and drive it to work, to the store and (since we only have one carseat) anywhere my husband and I go in the evening and on weekends.

If you're looking for an economical car that'll get you where you need to go and aren't worried about fancy additives, the Kia Sephia might be exactly what you're looking for.  If you want a $10k alternative to a Honda ... you get what you pay for.  I've seen many posts from people who were looking for $20k quality in a $10k package, and have been highly disappointed ... don't get caught in that trap!


***************************

It is now October 2002 and our family has moved yet again.  This time, we couldn't afford to transport our car, and our credit can't handle selling the Kia and buying another car in the new location, so I drove it from one place to the next (Washington State to Ohio).  I drove for 42 hours, stopping at hotels for two nights.  I drove through the mountains in Washington and Colorado, through driving rain in Montana and through extreme winds in South Dakota.  It was just me and my dog and a lot of stuff that we didn't want to send on a moving truck.  Things couldn't have gone better.  The car handled beautiful.  I think my average speed was 80 mph (speed limits in some of the states is "reasonable and prudent") and traffic was passing me as I went 85!  I had the front passenger seat reclined, and that's where my 75lb dog slept almost the entire way.  We stopped frequently for pee breaks and leg stretches, but I can't go very long in any car.  Thought I would update everybody about the fact that 2.5 years later (the car now has 23,000 miles on it) and after a 2,500 mile road trip ... I still LOVE my Kia!!!  And still, the only thing I would change, is to make it a van!  I'm seriously considering the Kia Sedona as my next vehicle!

PS ... I don't hit my elbow on the center console anymore! LOL
