            This is my first Nissan (and first foreign vehicle) ever. I love it. After having only so-so luck with Jeeps and Chevy's and horrible luck with Fords, I settled on the Xterra. This is a real SUV that was actually meant to leave the pavement - soccer moms beware!!! This is not for you. The X is built on a tough ladder frame and has true part time 4wd system with auto locking hubs (optional warn manual hubs available now too). I continue to be amazed at how well this SUV performs on the trial. I have had it places my Chevy S-10 could never go, and places I was too afraid to take a Cherokee to due to poor reliability. A few mods to the X such as upgrading the tires and shocks, and you've got an awesome vehicle for the trail as well as for 9-5 commutes. The X is fine in stock form, but the factory tires and shocks didn't cut it for me. 

This is also a very versitle SUV. The numerous tie-down hooks in the cargo area are so handy for strapping things down, and the gear basket on the roof is very handy for muddy, smelly, nasty things that you wouldn't want inside the cabin. 

The 6 cd player is decent, the speakers are decent, and the steering wheel audio controls (on the SE) are excellent too.

I opted for the auto trans because I hate shifting and cooking clutches on the trail. The auto trans is very tough and the shift points are well placed. Very smooth on the highway.

Has 4 hi and a true low range (4 low). The low gear could be a tad lower for steep decents, but is adequate as is. 

The X rides a bit rough if you're used to a car, but for a truck frame it is very smooth compared to my old Chevy's and Cherokees. Great utilitarian vehicle. For having an IFS suspension I am very impressed with the off-road performance of this vehicle. It's capabilities are beyond what *most people* will ever use it for. If you hit an off-road trail you'll be glad you're in an Xterra. It's the real magilla.
