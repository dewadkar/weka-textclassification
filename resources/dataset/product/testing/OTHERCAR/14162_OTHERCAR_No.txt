             I spent 9 years in the military working on and driving the Hummer and I found both good and bad points about this vehicle. I will start with the good seems how there are fewer good points than bad. This is a wide extremely stable vehicle both on the road and on the trails, its 4x4 capability exceeds most everything on the road which is good if you live in a swamp. They are also great in a collision because of there massive weight. And of course they are great for turning heads especially since this is the same vehicle that Arnold drives. Ok now for the bad points, first it is a noisy, rough, fuel guzzling, slug. When AM General designed this vehicle it was designed for military use in the field to replace the old jeeps, it was never designed to be driven the majority of the time on the road, because of this the full time 4 wheel drive system works great on the trails but very undependable if you drive on the asphalt most of the time. Because of the rough ride it rattles a tremendous amount, making for a very noisy uncomfortable ride for any distance. Also due to design there are more blind spots in it than an armored car so be cautious in traffic with it. So a great vehicle if you live in the outback, a not so great vehicle if you live in a city, but either way definitely not worth the money.<br><br>
