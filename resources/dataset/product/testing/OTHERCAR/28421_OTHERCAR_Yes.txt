            I have for years been an admirer of tightly and reliably built Japanese autos.  I have owned Nissans (Datsun at the time), a Toyota, and two Hondas, all purchased new. None of these automobiles disappointed me, and all retained value despite exceeding 100,000 miles in each.

In deciding to trade my Honda Accord last year, I sought out a 6 cylinder model to give me the power boost that would make frequent highway driving more comfortable and as well as affording a smooth cruising speed.

After trying Accord and Camry 6 cylinder models, I test drove a Maxima and was totally impressed with the power, handling, and quality of workmanship. It cruises effortlessly, is quieter than the Honda, and is similar to both the Accord and Camry in basic features.  Most importantly to me at the time was a substantial price differential which made the Maxima an easy choice. In a year of ownership, with at least 30,000 miles of travel, I have had no problems requiring a return trip to the dealer, and the ride is as quiet and tight as the day I bought it.

Criticism?  Boring styling, which has been upgraded some, but not enough, in the 2000 model. Why do the Honda's Camry's and Maxima's have to all look the same?  It is a great vehicle for those who want comfort, speed, good control, and reliability...but, not for those who want to impress with a good looking machine.<br><br>
