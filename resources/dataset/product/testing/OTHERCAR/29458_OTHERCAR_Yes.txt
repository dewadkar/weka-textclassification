            I am aware in todays society that a great many of todays Jeep Wranglers are used primarily for on road use. Yet this is still by far one  of the most capable off road vehicles in production. Unfortunatley this comes with a penalty of on road comfort. Wranglers have very stiff suspensions that give them a harsh ride. The seats are very upright for an excelent view of the road, but there is minimal leg room for taller drivers and passengers. The back seat is really only usefull and comfortable for smaller children.
There are two engine choices with the Wrangler, the 2.5L i4 and the 4.0L i6. Personally the 4 cylinder is too underpowered, and the gas milage is not that much greater over the 6 cylinder. But neither get &quot;good&quot; gas mileage.  Also the suspension on the four cylinder is set a little softer, which causes considerably more roll in turns. 
If you are looking for cargo space, this is definatley the wrong sport/ute for you. But if you want versitility, fun, and a car that will run for ever, by all means the Wrangler is for you. At a cost of around $20,000 dollars, you will have plenty of money to customize your Jeep to even better fit your needs. This is truly a throw back to the old days, and it still can kick some but out on the trails, and on the highways<br><br>
