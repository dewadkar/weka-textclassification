            I was a bit skeptical about a Mercedes being in the 25k-30k range, after all isn't that area reserved for the Toyotas and Nissans of the world. In other words the functional but mundane. Did I get a surprise! This car is great. First off, performance wise its supercharged engine makes it a delight to drive - too bad that the legal limit of 65mph holds this baby back. Its handling is superb, when nipping in and out of lanes in lousy weather the car is smooth and confident. I live in an area where there are a lot of hills to me that is the ultimate test, after all driving at 90 mph  will get you pulled over. This little car made it up the hills with no problems. 

The car is roomy, from the outside it looks small however there is plenty of room in the front and the back. I am 5'10" and can fit comfortably in the back. Would I want to drive from New York to Chicago, probably not, however could I sit there for an hour... yes, and I have done. 

The hatchback design is great, if you are going to load the car up then the rear seats collapse adding enough space to put in a 4' rolling rack for and all the clothing samples that would go with it. 

This car gave me everything that I wanted that the Mini Cooper could not give me, the Subaru WRX is just plain ugly as well as boring, and the PT Cruiser Turbo is uncomfortable. On the higher end, the CLK 320 is tighter for space, the Audi TT is a 2 seater, and the Boxter was out of my price line.

I have had it for 30 days and have 3200 miles on it. Each one is more enjoyable than the next. It is a fun car, deceptively spacious, cool looking. The only negative is that the CD player is optional, which means you pay over the top for a dealer installed one, and the basic sound system is weak - the optional Bose system is worth the extra. 

I love driving this car
