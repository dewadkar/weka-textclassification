            I bought my Rodeo in 1995, and 90k miles later, I still don't have a single complaint.  

For the main part I have kept up on the maintenance.  I've gone 7,000-9,000 miles between an oil change once or twice, or more.  So far, I've spent a total of about $2500 dollars on maintenance of all types, including oil changes and tires.  At about 80,000 miles I had the timing belt changed and some other preventative stuff done.  As far as actual problems, so far the only thing to fail on this vehicle was the water pump, everything else I've had done was just standard maintenance.  I will be happy to let you know when I have something fail.  It just hasn't happened yet.

As for mileage, well, you can't have everything and I knew that in advance.  As with everything, there are some trade-offs.  Your gas mileage is not spectacular.  I get about 300 miles on a $22 dollar fill-up ( at the current 1.40 per gallon prices).  

I bought this vehicle for 2 reasons.  One, I don't like the idea of being stuck in my house when we get hit with a foot or more of snow, which has happened more than once to me.  

The other reason, and more important reason.  I will never buy a compact, sub-compact, or even mid-size car.  I was involved in an accident a few years back, and my car purchases are forever changed.  We were in a 1971 Buick Centurion and we T-boned a 1991 Ford Festiva.  It was brutal, that Ford got spun 180 degrees in the air and landed in a ditch off the side of the road.  (the driver was drinking and went to jail)  Out of 5 people in that car, three were killed, one got flown out by helo with a broken neck, and one suffered several broken bones.  In our Buick, one passenger had cuts on her hand because she had it sticking out the window at the time.  Do the math, it equals get a big car unless your family's safety isn't a priority to you.  Aren't your children's lives worth the extra 5 grand and gas money ?  Mine are.<br><br>
