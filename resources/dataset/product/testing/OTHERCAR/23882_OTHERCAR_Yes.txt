            I bought my 95 Millenia S in January of 98 with 71,000 miles on it.  I was worried because I bought it at a &quot;lease return auction&quot;, and had no clue what the previous owner had done to to it.  It was a gamble...

...and it paid off.  The car has been absolutely wonderful.  For starters, when buying used one usually gets a fairly good deal to begin with.  When buying a used Millenia S one gets a great deal.  Out the door, with the optional $800 warranty from the used car dealer (which I never used), I paid a little over $16K.  The reason I say that one gets a great deal buying a used Millenia S is because it's a Mazda, and these things almost depreciate faster than the computer I'm writing this on.  And that's not due to it being a poorly designed/engineered car (it's fantastic).  Nor does it have anything to do with reliability (110K miles now, no problems for me).  It's basic supply and demand.  The simple fact of the matter is that most people that want to buy a used &quot;near-luxury&quot; car will opt for the Lexus ES300, BMW 3 series, Mercedes C280, or perhaps Acura TL.  Pretty much all of these brands are held in higher esteem due in part to being good cars, but in large part due to good marketing (an art that Mazda is only recently learning).  

The Car
Inside-
My 95 Millenia S is Black with the Beige interior.  Every time somebody gets in they always comment on it being a very nice car (their next question is &quot;What kind of car is this?&quot;).  My favorite interior feature is the Steering wheel that automatically raises when the key is taken out of the ignition, allowing for easy entrances and exits for larger individuals (I'm about 6'3).  Headroom is ample, and the driving position is very comfortable.  The S comes with a six CD changer and a Bose sound system.  Reception is great, and the quality of sound is tops.  The back seat, I'll admit, is a bit smaller than some sedans, but even my friends that are 6'5 fit, so it's not too bad.)  On the whole, &quot;fit and finish&quot; is great.  

Outside-
The paint on the car still looks great.  The wheels are in pretty good shape, but the Chrome does show a bit of wear on some of the not so visible portions of the wheel, and only upon close inspection.  The lines are great, and I've always loved the way the car looks.  If you've gotten to the point of reading this review then I probably don't need to explain much more.  

The Drive-
Driving is sheer pleasure.  The Supercharged 210 hp Miller Cycle engine scoots me along the 405 with no problems whatsoever.  One can accelerate and change lanes with confidence in this car.  The button on the side of the shift lever allows for you to manually drop one gear instead of having to punch the accelerator.  At 80 mph this car feels like it's cruising along at 50 mph.  I've hit a bit over 125 (it was a deserted road), and I still felt very safe.  Handling is good, though coming from my GTI the body roll is a bit more than I would like.  Taking the corners hard does cause the car to sway a bit, but compared to most of the other sedans I've ridden in it still measure up very well.  There is some wind noise, but it is very minor.

Overall-
I really can't say enough good things about this car.  In addition to the comments I had above, there is one thing that I left out until the end.  This is a very safe car.  In the frontal crash the Drivers side received 4 stars out of 5, and the passenger side received 5 out of 5.  This, in addition to the antilocks (used them), and traction control make me feel that my passengers and I are always in good hands.
