            When i bought this car it was in 1999...and it costed me around $4000......its now 2001 and i have put about another $1000 into it, no big deal i guess considering it had 131,000 miles on it when i got it and it now has 153,000 miles on it, the first big thing that went on me was the engine (more my fault then the engine...if you take care of this engine it will take care of you w/out a doubt), V6 3.1L  very nice engine but also very hard to find and very pricey...around 600 for the engine if your lucky and another 400 for installation if you cant do it yourself.  now my transmission is going....also a very pricy fix.....other then them two big things the only things i have had to put into this car is a water pump and two headlights (headlights are a bit expensive for the SE style...around $25) now the possatives....this car is a very sharpe looking car in my opinion, and its just now showing signs of rust after almost 10 years and 150,000 miles...the interier is very comfortable and there is plenty of room for it being a 2 door...so all in all, if you take care of this car it will take care of you.
