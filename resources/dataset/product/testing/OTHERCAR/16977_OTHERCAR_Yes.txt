            Terrifyingly rare, yet with a delectable Pininfarina-sculpted shape that seems friendly and innocuous, this '61 Ferrari is a true GT and a road-burner in disguise.  Some time ago, I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to drive this wonderful car while on a visit to a family friend.  Mr. Dunholter, the venerable old man who owns this automobile, was gracious enough to allow me to take a quick spin around the uncrowded suburban streets of Southern California.  While my short drive was unspectacular, the car itself is evocative of squealing tires, musical exhaust notes and Le Mans victories.  A collector of Ferraris, Mr. Dunholter has owned some of the finest machines to ever come out of Maranello.  This is his only Ferrari left, and most probably his last.  And what a way to go out.

Between 1959 and 1962, Maranello manufactured 167 of the cars.  Of the 167 built, 74 were competition racing cars.  Notching wins at Le Mans, Spa, Nassau and the Nurbrgring, the 250 GT was definitely one of the most accomplished racers of its era.  The car is simply built, with a tubular chassis and a 3.0 liter V12 living up front.  This 280 bhp unit was coupled to a four-speed transmission of Porsche origins and three twin-choke Weber carbs.  The outward simplicity of the car masks its true Ferrari nature--wonderfully predictable handling and a drag coefficient of 0.33.  And there is no hiding the two sets of double-drainpipe exhausts gracing the rear fascia.  All told, the non-competition version tops out at 146 MPH, with the competition models more like 165+.  Furthermore, 0-60 comes in 6.6 seconds, and 61 MPH is attainable in first gear alone.  

The interior of the car is very businesslike.  Black leather bucket seats look comfortable, but are, in reality thinly padded.  The gauges are well-placed as is expected on a racecar in disguise.  The speedometer reaches an optimistic, yet intimidating, 300 km/h.  The most intriguing part of this car, however, is undoubtedly the beautiful Pinifarina-sculpted curves.  Each body panel was hand made by Scaglietti Coachworks, and replacement is next to impossible.  On road cars, the front grille is adorned by the familiar prancing horse, and small front bumpers were added to the sides.  The competition versions had no prancing horse, nor did it have bumpers, creating a front fascia that suggests muscle and means business.

In 1960, Ferrari's chief importer, Luigi  Chinetti suggested a drop-top aimed at the American road-racer market.  The result was the 250 GT California Spyder, immortalized in the movie &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off.&quot;  I think Ferris characterized the car very well in two words: &quot;Que Bella!&quot;
