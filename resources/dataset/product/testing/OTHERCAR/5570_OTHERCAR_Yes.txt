            I purchased a 99 Suzuki Swift with the following expectations:

-Exellent gas mileage
-Low price
-Easy handling
-Reliability
I have not been disappointed. I drive up to 100 miles daily in my job as a home health nurse. I am faced with all types of weather including ice and snow. This car handles very well in both. The only weather that it doesn't measure up to is in high winds. My little Swift reminds me of the old Volkswagon Bugs that I used to own years ago when it comes to being blown
around. I was able to purchase my Swift for 1000.00 less than dealer's invoice and also qualified for a no-down 5.9% loan through Suzuki Auto Credit.

I did not expect

-A quiet ride
-Lots of leg room
-Lots of power

I would certainly recommend this car to anyone who needs a reliable, affordable vehicle. I would also recommend this car to anyone who is considering a Hyundai or Geo Metro. Swifts are almost identical to Metros
except for having a more powerful engine.
