            As a past owner of a 1999 Super Duty Ford F-250 Crew Cab 4x4, I was very unhappy with the trucks overall ride quality and reliability. In 2001, GM introduced it's new line of HD 2500 series trucks with the DuraMax Diesel engine option coupled to a Allison 5 speed heavy duty automatic transmission. I decided to follow this trucks progress very closely. Over the next two years, this truck continued to improve in many areas so I finally decided to make the leap. In August 2002, I ordered a 2003 GMC HD 2500 SLT Crew Cab 4x4 short bed with every option available including the DuraMax Diesel, Allison transmission and rear seat DVD. The Truck arrived early October, approx. 8 weeks from time of order. 

While this truck cost more than my first house, I was able to purchase the truck for $500 over actual dealer invoice, or $8000 less than MSRP sticker by utilizing and internet Auto buying service and factory rebate incentives. The first thing I noted when driving this truck for the first time is how quiet the Diesel Engine is. You would never know sitting behind the wheel you're driving a heavy duty truck. It drives and feels like a luxury Cadillac. It's has every bell and whistle a person could ever want. The Leather interior is comfortable and stylish. The Bose sound system is awesome! The rear seat DVD video system is wonderful and keeps the kids quiet and happy during long trips.

Overall, This is the perfect truck! It is a serious Heavy Duty truck capable of towing up to 15000 lbs, with the road manners and interior comfort of a luxury car. I highly recommend the 2003 GMC Duramax for those needing a serious power and towing capability without sacrificing comfort!
