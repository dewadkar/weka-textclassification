            Yes, the name is strange.  When friends ask me what truck I bought, I simply refer to it as the, &quot;compact SUV by Suzuki&quot;.  Immediately, they reply, &quot;Oh, you mean that Grand Viagra thing&quot;, to which I reply, &quot;Yep.  That's the one.&quot;

Other than the name and plentiful amounts of plastic on the body and on the dashboard, I am pleasantly satisfied with this truck!  We live at an altitude of 9000 feet (and not to mention, off of a dirt road) where 8 inches of snow is commonplace.  In 2WD mode, the truck responds like a 2WD should... fishtailing a bit around slippery turns and spinning wheels when on an icy patch.  But in 4WD mode, I was surprised at how the truck commands the road.

Another factor that led me to choose the Grand Viagra was the type of frame it sits on.  Other compact SUV's handle ordinary car-type frames, whereas the Suzuki sits on a more rugged frame, capable of handling off-road terrain.  So if you plan on hitting the hills and backroads like on the commercials, consider this point.

Speaking of frames, let me talk about the size of the truck.  I recently bought a new bed frame which comes in one of those long boxes.  I dropped one rear seat down, slid the box into the truck, and conveniently used one end of the box as an armrest while I drove.  This truck is advertised as a compact, and it certainly is!  But for weekend backcountry trips, it's terrific... we throw the bikes or skis on top, put a bag (or three) in the back, and hit the road!  And even then, our 50 pound dog didn't complain of lack of space.

Driving from Denver to our home is a 4000 foot climb.  The engine (at 155hp) does have enough &quot;oomph&quot; to get up the hill and not drop speed on steep inclines.  In fact, put the pedal to the medal and you'll actually speed up (slowly, nonetheless) going up those inclines.  So yes, you will be able to pass those large 18-wheelers when you need to.  But if it were upto me, I would drop 200 horses into the engine, given the 3000+ pound weight of the vehicle.

Overall, we are very satisfied.  The wife uses it for the 10 mile trek to the grocery store in any weather.  We also use it for our jaunts over to the ski slopes.  We were very happy with the price we paid, and everytime we drive the Suzuki, we feel like we got more for the money.  This truck is a great value for someone who wants to tackle bad road conditions AND pay less than $20k, but is willing to give up cargo space.<br><br>
