                This is the third mini-van I have owned, and it is the best of all. I was planning to buy a sedan, but I liked the way this car drove and looked. 
    I like the smooth ride and easy handling.  The best feature is the automatic sliding door- when your arms are full of packages, it just takes a click to get the door open. The door is great for loading and unloading my kids and their friends; I don't have to remind anyone to close the door. I also like the headphones in the back seat so I can listen to the radio while my kids listen to a tape.
    The seats are very comfortable and there is a decent amount of cargo space behind the third seat. The car is easy to drive; visibility is great. 
     This car is ideal for people who have kids who need to be transported or for a small business that needs to deliver products.  The seats are modular and can be easily removed.
     I have not needed any repairs on this car in two years.<br><br>
