            The <b>DC200</b> is an excellent camera for what it is.
It's designed to upgrade your 35mm Point-And-Click to Digital.

The Picture Quality is <b>EXCELLENT</b>.
The Camera Use is EXCELLENT/EASY.
The Video OUT on the camera is an EXCELLENT feature.
The Interface for downloading your pictures to your computer is SLOW.

If you want ZOOM or MACRO cameras this camera is NOT for you.  It is a simple point-and-click camera.  The <b>DC200</b> is fun to take on trips or events and takes GREAT pictures.  

The memory card that is shipped with the camera will take about 24 pictures on 640x480 resolution.  A better lens and lens cover could be supplied, but the picture quality for the price makes up for this generously.<br><br>
