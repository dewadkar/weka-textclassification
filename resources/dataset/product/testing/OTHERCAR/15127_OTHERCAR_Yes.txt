            Our PLAN was to buy an Accord or Camry for myself as a graduation gift.  The new Altimas came out & my husband loved them.  We were deciding btwn the 3 when my Father pestered us for a week to test drive the XG350L (in 1 day, we got 3 calls from him).  Finally, just to shut him up (and be able to tell him we drove it but hated it), we tried the car.  

To our skeptical eyes, it LOOKED great (but not as sharp as the Altima).  We drove the car to Pic-A-Chic farm in Southern Indiana (drive on country road full of hairpin turns) and on Hwy 37.  Spouse & I tried HARD to find things we DIDN'T like about the car.  At one point, I heard a loud ticking sound.  "What's that sound?" I asked my husband.  We both cocked our heads, trying to determine the source of the noise, which we both were convinced was the car.  

Oh My Gosh!  It's my watch!

We looked at each other in amazement, and laughed at ourselves.  Went back & minutes later, test drove the 2003 Accord EX.  As soon as the dealer started the Honda's engine, I thought it was loud relative to the XG350L.  Got inside, and I wasn't as impressed with the interior as I was before the Hyundai, and I was ready to stop the test-drive.  But knowing my husband loved Accords and Nissans, I kept my mouth shut and kept driving.  I didn't want to hear him rant that I didn't give the Honda a decent chance.  15 minutes into the drive, I asked him if he wanted to drive (mind you, he pestered me for his turn at the wheel with the Hyundai).  Five minutes later, he said with a sad tone "Let's turn around."  "Why" I asked him.  "Because I can't BELIEVE I like the Hyundai better than THIS!"  

"How are we going to explain to our friends we're buying a Rodney King car?"  

Our family and friends (except my parents) were ALL skeptical about our purchase.  I was inundated with corny remarks about my level of stupidity despite my having earned a doctorate.  Now, these critic (having seen and driven the car) are die-hard fans of the car, especially when they found out what we paid for the car (purchased a demo with 1000 miles on it).  Yes, we still get laughs, but ONLY from those who have not seen, been in, or driven the car.  All others have been SILENCED, and we get to see envy in their eyes.  To borrow from another company's slogan, seeing is believing.  

The car is packed full of features - all of the stuff I wanted on my parent's top-o-the-line Passat, but for 10 grand less.  We've owned it nearly 2 months.  It does seem to take a lot of gas to me.  Then again, I drove a 4-cyl. Corolla which SIPS gas, so ANY V-6 would seem like a gas-guzzler to me.  Other than that, I have NO complaints.  Not of the dealer (they were fabulous and friendly), and especially not the car.  

Yes, Hyundai might seem like a risk, relatively speaking.  But their products get better each year (unlike other car makers who experienced declines in quality for an extensive period of time).  I'm a researcher by training, so I dug up everything I could on the car.  I also checked with all of my Korean friends in grad school to find out what they know about this car from back home.  All High Marks!

Like a sound stock purchase, we bought when the product is solid and alot is at stake for Hyundai.  They can't goof up NOW, and I am convinced they won't!  Besides, the warranty put me at ease in the unlikely event they do.

Just yesterday, my husband remarked that knowing what we know about this car, and having vigorously tested all competitors, we would be FOOLS to buy something else if the opportunity arose again.  If we hit the lotto and was given $50,000 for a high end car, we'd BUY THIS CAR ALL OVER AGAIN, pocket the significant amount of change and laugh all the way to the bank.
