            Thanks to the very generous people at Enterprise, my wife and I have spent the last 3 weeks driving over 1000 miles in a 2001 Cadillac Seville SLS in a range of situations and we have come to love it....

Specifics first....  The SLS is the cheaper version of the Seville.  IT comes with a range of luxury goodies (power everything, heated leather memory seats), safety goodies (front and side airbags, ABS, traction and stability control, scads of metal), OnStar, 4.6 liter Northstar V8, and that great leather smell.

What's it like:

1) Handling.  My understanding is that the Seville is supposed to be the sportier Cadillac (at least compared to the Deville)--a little smaller and a little spunkier.  That being said, I found it surprisingly easy to squeak the tires when merging onto the freeway.  There was a little bit of body lean in turns, but not too bad.  To its credit, there was little (if any) dive when braking.  In addition, the steering had very little play and was as responsive as can be expected for such a heavy (3986 lbs) and long (201 inches--almost 17 feet) car.

2) Powertrain.  This automatic may even be better than a stick! It always put the car in just the right gear, and would let the engine rev to redline under heavy acceleration.  The engine is a wonder.  It's beyond powerful.  When driven sanely, it's quiet, but when you punch it, it gets beefier--still quiet, but with some oomph.

3) Ride.  This is the main disappointment in the Seville.  When going over bad pavement (or even freeway seams), you feel them--much more than we did in a 2000 Town Car.  In addition, you heard the road noise as well.  This isn't to say that we had to raise our voices to talk, but in a car like this, I expected total smoothness and silence.

4) Comfort.  This is a comfy car for the driver and passenger, no doubt.  I could get the seat just right and even telescope the steering wheel closer so that I didn't have to stretch my arms too much.  The seats are heated which means that your butt won't get sore (not that they would, anyways).   Even better--the adjustable lumbar pad.  So nice.....  The backseat is less comfy, though.  The heated seats seem to have the heater right in the buttpad which makes the seat somewhat hard.  In addition, there isn't a lot of legroom.  When I (5'5") was sitting behind my wife (5'4"), my knees practically hit her almost-perfectly-straight-up seat.  This is too big a car to have so little space in the back.

5) Ergonomics.  Everything is right where you'd want it to be.  My only complaints are that the cruise control buttons are mounted way down on the lower spokes of the steering wheel and can be a little hard to reach and that the power seat controls are on the side of the seat rather than on the door (like on the Town Car).  The stereo buttons are large and easy to push, the dual-zone climate control is easy to work, and on and on.  There's really nothing to complain about on this car.

6) A/C.  Dual zone climate control.  For once, my wife and I are both comfortable.  It's great.

7) Stereo.  This isn't the fancy Bose stereo available on the STS, but it's amazingly good.  We used it for radio, classical on CD, and a drive-in movie.  All were wonderful--comparable to our home stereo (good quality stuff).

8) Gas Mileage.  Finally, something to complain about.  For mostly around town driving, expect to get 16-17 mpg.  Then again, if you can afford one of these puppies, you can afford to put gas in it.

9) Safety.  The stability/traction control works great.  I stomped on the gas on wet pavement, the car engaged something, and I was able to move forward. The size of the car inspires confidence as well--I feel more invincible in it than in my wife's Pathfinder.

10) Reliability.... At 12000 miles (it's a rental--so they're 12000 hard miles) it clearly needs a brake job.  The memory seats don't always remember positions perfectly.  Other than that, everything works fine.  Pretty good for an American car....

All in all, we're really enjoying the car.  It's comfortable, smooth, and truly luxurious in every way.  Other than the handling and my distrust of GM, I'd say that this is a must buy if you can afford it.  We're really going to miss it when we turn it in.
