            I&#146ve had my OPTIO S for 2 weeks and here&#146s what I find:

Great size &#150 that&#146s why I bought it!

My main disappointment is picture quality.  My wife has the Canon S230 and pictures from it are more vibrant and the color is truer.  I have a Kodak CX4300 and its pictures are also better than the OPTIO S.  Why do we have cameras?  -- to take great pictures!

The OPTIO S controls are NOT intuitive &#150 you have to go to the manual every time you want to learn how to do some thing (like record a movie or understand what those funny little symbols mean when you select different flash modes &#150 my Kodak digital camera says: &#145Flash Off&#146, &#145Fill Flash&#146, &#145Red Eye On&#146, and &#145Auto Flash&#146 - no funny symbols).
 
Yes the manual needs an index and it does have some &#145problems&#146 &#150 for example, on page 36 it says &#147There are 7 available modes in Picture mode&#148 and then refers you to page 54 where it says &#147There are 9 available modes in Picture mode&#148 &#150 maybe by the time they got around to writing page 54 they thought of 2 more modes!

There&#146s a setting for taking a picture of &#147yourself&#148 but the manual doesn&#146t explain how to use it (I&#146m not talking about the self-timer &#150 that is explained in the manual).

The camera is very complicated (my opinion).  I still haven&#146t figured out how to get the date on the picture nor how to use the built-in filters it&#146s suppose to have.  I need to do more instruction book reading.

Yes you can use it as a voice recorder but when you do the lens extends and then retracts before it goes into &#147record mode&#148.  On playback, the speaker is hard to hear even at max volume (I challenge you to try to figure out how to change the speaker volume without reading the manual).  The voice record feature is more of a novelty than useful.

The strap that comes with the camera is huge!  I think they want you to hang the camera around your neck.  It&#146s still in the box.

The on/off button is right next to the shutter release button &#150 and yes, I have turned the camera off inadvertently when I wanted to take a picture.  The power button is on the top corner of the camera &#150 right where your finger ends up when you are holding the camera to take a picture.

Movies are limited to 30 seconds.  I think the designers figured that since the movie quality is so poor that you would be stupid to use it more than 30 seconds so they&#146re protecting us from ourselves &#150 like requiring helmets when you&#146re on a motorcycle.  Also, you can&#146t use the optical zoom while taking a movie &#150 so you have to be pretty close to your subject.

The body of the camera is aluminum but the cover that goes over the battery/memory card compartment is plastic and it has a hinge made of 1/8 inch rubber!  I like to load my pictures in my PC via a card reader (to save camera battery power) so I end up opening this little flimsy door a lot.  Besides, you can&#146t charge the battery while it&#146s in the camera.  You have to take the battery out every time and put it in a separate charger that comes with the camera.  Of course, that means opening that little flimsy door again.  I&#146m afraid in a year or two this door will be held on to my camera with a piece of tape.

I think I&#146ll get used to this camera and at least learn (and remember) the sequence of events I have to go through to do what I want to do with it.  I carry it with me everywhere just like I carry my PDA.

I bought the camera new on EBAY from Priceitwholesale for $369 (no shipping charge).
