              The Canon G2 was introduced in the fall of 2001 in the midst of other 4 megapixel cameras. Fortunately this camera is built on a the proven G1 platform and adds features and performance. I considered the Sony 707, Nikon Coolpix 5000(5mp) and the Olympus 4040 during my prepurchase research. The other cameras all offer great features similar to the G2. We have been using a Nikon 8008 for about 12 years and I thought the CP5000 was our first choice until I met the Canon.

  The Canon has a certain weight and visual quality that put it on par with traditional cameras thereby easing the transition from film to digital. The major controls are easily accessible and most can be operated with one hand during shooting, but I would encourage using both hands to improve accuracy and security. The on/off switch and manual focus require two hands. In Playback mode it is easier to use two hands to page through the pictures and access the zoom, histogram and edit functions. The display is very useful for the presbyopically challenged especially since it can be rotated and swiveled. Of course it has limited use in bright sunshine.

  The Camera has three manual modes; full manual, shutter priority and aperture priority. It also has a program and full auto modes. Additionally there are modes in what Canon calls the creative zone; pan focus, portrait, landscape and night shot. All of the above are selected from the on/off mode dial on top  of the camera. The flash is either manually or automatically configured according to the mode selection. There is also a movie mode which is somewhat limited by the memory size but nonetheless it can be utilized for short clips.

  Pictures can be stored in two formats, RAW and JPEG. I typically use the raw format which is unprocessed information straight from the ccd. It is not unlike a digital negative and can be manipulated for color and white balance after the picture is taken. It also offers a more compact storage size. The other option JPEG offers a wide range of options relative to the resolution and compression of the image.

  Canon provided an excellent lens with this camera. I am amazed at the low light capability of this camera. I've been using it for two months and to be honest, I just haven't had to use the flash. It will take excellent pictures indoors under ambient conditions. 

  There are several other features contributing to this camera's ability to produce great pictures. The white balance can be set for eight different modes. It has single and continuous focus modes, five flash modes, three metering modes, exposure compensation, AE lock, macro mode, manual focus and flash compensation. I may have missed something, but I'm sure it is evident that this is a real camera one that is ready to go up against sophisticated film based cameras. The histogram function is very helpful for evaluating exposures right after taking a picture. It provides a graph of the image brightness.

  On the down side, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the case cracking problem. Canon is rumored to be making an announcement in the next few days. 

  I would recommend reading some of the in depth reviews which are available on the web. They provide technical evaluations and details relative to the many features and functions. They also provide consumers with the background needed to evaluate cameras which is especially useful in the retail environment.

  Finally, I purchased this camera on the www using my Amex Blue which enabled me to pricematch it against another vendor. Locally the camera sold for $954 including tax. The web price was $749 and I pricematched it for $549.
