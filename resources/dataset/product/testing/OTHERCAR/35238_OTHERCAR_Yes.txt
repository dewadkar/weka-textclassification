            I suppose when my boyfriend calls me a Trooper, I should take it as a complement.  If it takes after my SUV, that is.  My 1994 Trooper has been nothing but a pleasure to own.  Not only does it drive much more smoothly than other SUV's (I test drove almost everything!), but it is comfortable, roomy, and has held up extremely well through all of the trips and driving I have put it through.  I think the best feature of the Trooper is the oversized sunroof.  I have to say it was the biggest selling point for me. The back seat foot massager is a bit of a novelty item, but it is a conversation piece.  The Trooper has cruised all over California and Nevada lugging climbing gear, sleeping bags, 400 binoculars, surfboards, skis, tents, and many people.  The back seat seats 3 large people comfortably and if you want, 2 people can sit in the &quot;way back&quot; too.  I paid off my SUV last year and it has held a lot of its value.  I would highly recommend the Isuzu Trooper to anyone wanting a solid ride.<br><br>
