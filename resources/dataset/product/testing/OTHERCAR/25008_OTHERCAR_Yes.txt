            2002 VW BUG (NEW BEETLE)			By Matthew McLean

PUNCHBUGGYRED! SAWITFIRST! �OW! Did anyone else grow up smashing their pals in the shoulder at the first sight of a "Bug"? I sure did. The original VW Bug is solely responsible for more than four decades worth of bruised, aching shoulders. Yet, personal injury notwithstanding, VW has done it again. The all-new VW Bug is fun to drive, economical to own, and of course, it is an absolute joy to behold (for most of us). Now, if only I could find those old college football pads...

It amazes me: rarely does an automobile manufacturer create a vehicle that is economical, reliable, unique, fun to drive, artful, and enduring -all at the same time. In my opinion, the majority of the major automakers in business today could certainly stand to learn a thing or three from the small handful of the more creative automakers who aren't afraid to take stylistic/package risks. But, these are the musings of a different breed of article�

To many of you, the new Bug is just another cute looking personal car. But to three generations of people who grew up with one of those Bugs that sound 'just-like-a-lawnmower' in their lives, this new offering from VW is more than merely another cute retro-mobile. It is the rebirth of a cultural icon. The engine might be in the wrong end, but the spirit of the immortal Bug lives on.

This begs a few very important questions: is the new Bug everything the original was? Does it have the same economical, bang-for-your-buck orientation which allowed it to become one of the best selling vehicles of all time? Does it capture the heart of the prospective owner after the fashion of its predecessor because, simply put, it's "just too cool?" Will it lend itself to the myriad of modifications spawned from the original? (Let's not forget that the original VW Bug unintentionally founded its own entire industry -kit cars.) And perhaps the most important question of them all, is it a "groovy" car?

In a word, Maybe. Sorry, but that's simply the way it is. Aside from its unique bulbous styling (some people think it looks like a blob of melted candle wax -I happen to disagree), it is an entirely different automobile than the original Bug.

For starters, the original Beetle had its engine in the rear of the car, just like a Porsche 911. The new Bug has its engine in a more traditional location: in front of the windshield, where most of us expect to find such things. This next point might not mean much to some of you, but to hardcore VW, Porsche, and Subaru fans, there is another very significant engine difference: the original bug (in all its evolutionary stages) sported a horizontally-opposed powerplant.

This design is considered unconventional, but is more common than, for example, a Wankel Rotary design (i.e. Mazda RX-3, RX-7, and the upcoming RX-8). Porsche 911's (and 912's, 930's, etc.) have always had horizontally-opposed engines, and we all know what a 911 is capable of in terms of performance and handling. Here, the new Bug differs in the direction of the mainstream: pop the hood (not the trunk -!), and you will find an in-line four-cylinder engine in either one of four variations. Your four engine choices for 2002 are as follows:

-- 2.0L, 115-hp SOHC (single overhead camshaft) I-4 (in-line 4-cylinder): this is the base powerplant, and comes standard, unless you opt for one of these nifty alternatives�

-- 1.9L, 90-hp SOHC turbodiesel I-4: this is the frugal miser of the bunch� but this engine's torque will surprise you, I promise (if you are unfamiliar with diesels, that is).

-- 1.8L, 150-hp DOHC (dual overhead camshafts) turbocharged I-4: this engine completely changes the character of the bug from a cute, economical runabout to a cute economical runabout �with Tabasco! (Especially with a 5-speed�)

-- 1.8L, 180-hp DOHC (dual overhead camshafts) turbocharged I-4: this is definitely the engine of choice for the serious enthusiast driver. Related to the engine in the way-cool Audi TT, it is a new option on the Bug for the 2002 model year. This wonderful engine is also available throughout most of the VW lineup (in everything except the Cabrio and Passat -for now). In other words, if you love this engine (and you will), but can't stomach the Bug's unique style, for a very similar price, you can have one in a Golf, GTI or Jetta instead (I happen to think the new Jetta is a stunning automobile, by the way). This joyous engine transforms the Bug into an R-rated ride at an amusement park -trust me on this one, it's an absolute blast. Of course, there are rumors of a 200-hp VR6 Bug�. :-)

Ok, enough engine stuff (I can hear the comments now� "shuddup, willya!?"). Back to the car. The original bug was a 2+2 coupe with its trunk in the front. The new Bug is a 2+2 hatchback, with its (very small) "trunk" located behind the rear passengers. However, folding the rear seats down changes all that. With the seats flat (well, almost flat), a trip to Home Depot is still a bit of a stretch of the imagination, but your weekly trip to the grocery store is easily possible.

Let's drive this thing. Ok, as you might expect (if you've read any of my other reviews), in my humble opinion, the 5-speed manual transmission is the way to go with any variant of the New Beetle (except the new 180-hp turbo, which gets a slick 6-speed stick instead). This is for two reasons, both of which are entirely subjective: 1) driving a stick is a LOT more fun than an automatic (if you like to drive, that is, you take pleasure out of the act itself), and 2) in the normally-aspirated (non-turbocharged) model, the automatic transmission really left me wishing for more power. I appreciate fuel economy as much as the next guy, but what can I say? There's simply no such thing as too many ponies lurking under the hood, ready to pounce at a moments notice.

That said, my (first) extensive thrill-ride, oops� I mean "road test" of a new turbo Bug took place behind the wheel of a Y2K, electric blue, 5-speed turbo (150-hp). �What a party! Ok, it's not exactly a Porsche Turbo, but it goes like stink none the less. Of course, the 180-hp version is even faster --probably more go-power than most drivers need (not moi, of course  --hehe).

For the pittance one must part with to acquire one of these (about $22-23K, brand-spanking-new), the 150-hp turbo Bug is about as fun as it gets in this price range. Sure there are faster cars for the money, but somehow none of them are quite so much fun. People stare. You stare. People giggle. You giggle (especially when you mash the pedal of the Bug Turbo). Get the idea? �This car isn't about sensible. Nor is it about slick. It isn't even about making the guy in the turbocharged and slammed Integra feel slow (although it might do so) This car is just plain fun. And lots of it. That's the whole point of the New Beetle. Want to be a kid again? Right this way please�

One of the (many) aspects of the car that truly surprised me was its relatively neutral cornering stance. I expected the car to be very top-heavy (it's tall), and therefore unstable in twisties and switchbacks, but I had no trouble plowing aggressively through curves at um� lofty speeds. I'm a big fan of cars that stick to the road like glue (Preludes, Porsches, etc.), and while there are certainly cars out there with more grip, the New Beetle offers decidedly better than average roadholding ability. In the hands of an experienced driver, the new Bug will hold its own with anything in its price class on most road courses.

The interior of the car is, let's be frank: strange/unique/odd/quirky. Whatever you call it, there's just nothing else like it. The dash is so expansive that you can almost imagine eating dinner in the car on your new "dashboard dining table". This will freak you out. I never really got used to it, myself. You really don't notice it when the car is in motion, but when you stop, you somehow feel like you're sitting at a large desk or conference table. It's certainly an odd feeling. Of course, the very upright seating position only contributes to the table/desk sensation. Then again, I (personally) happen to favor an upright seating position such as this. It almost forces you to remain (more) awake behind the wheel, and provides much better visibility all around.

The New Beetle should be the Official Car of IKEA. No kidding. They ought to give all their employees one for training purposes or something. Everything inside that you can touch, turn, click, grab on to, open, etc., is thoroughly ultra-modern and most definitely "Star Trek". Some people think it's futuristic, others think it's ugly. I happen to love it. VW has done a fine job with this interior. The cupholders are even so snug and grippy (rubber fins hold your Coke) that sometimes getting things out of them is a challenge. I also like the feel of both the steering wheel and shift knob. Both are just right, somehow (this is apparently much harder to accomplish than you might imagine).

The seats are wonderful, and I promise you'll love the dash lights. Almost everything lights up in deep sapphire blue! No kidding! If you haven't taken a look at the nighttime dashboard in a new VW lately, you've really got to see this. It looks and feels like something out of Blade Runner or Star Trek. I absolutely love it.

One thing that really bothered me about the interior of the New Bug is that it's somewhat of a challenge to figure out how some things work, where various things are, etc., without reading the owners manual. I personally think cars should be super-intuitive in terms of accessory operation. Of course, if you've ever had a VW before, then this will be nothing new to you. VW's are just quirky. �Suffer. It's worth it. Those of you who were raised on Hondas and Toyotas will be totally baffled the first time you try to change the seat position, pop the back hatch from inside the car, etc. Oh, and once you figure out how to work the sunroof, I promise you'll play with it for at least twenty minutes.

One additional item worth mentioning that bothered me about the interior of this car: I am about six feet tall, and I simply cannot sit upright in the back seat of a new Bug; my head hits the glass. However, I suppose that's alright, as this car isn't marketed as, or intended to be, a family sedan. For what it is, it is just right. (Of course, I fit just fine in the back seat of a Golf�)

We all know what this car looks like: a collection of your favorite flavor of Lifesavers all stuck together (like they got loose in your pocket and went through the wash that way). The colors offered are attention-getting and bold (translation: cops will see you no matter what). It's hard to be low-key in one of these, even if it's a white one (the most conservative colors offered are black and white). Personally, I would go either silver or black, but I must admit that the vivid blue somehow really works on this car.

If you've ever been up close to one of these, the one thing that stands out in your mind is just how large/tall a car this is. It's not very long, but everything is sort of out of proportion and bigger than usual. The windows are big. The wheel arches are big. The car is taller than a lot of people I know. The headlights are big. The taillights are huge. And everything (everything!) is round, or at least partly round. Visually the closest thing to a New Bug is, well, an Old Bug. No kidding. It's that unique. And yes, I dig it (but it took me a while to really get into this car).

Ok, now for the bad news. This car will probably nickel-and-dime you to death once it's about four or five years old. VWs are known for this, and apparently this car is no different (but I'd buy one anyway). Little things (mostly switches, tiny relays and motors, etc) will continually break once the car reaches a certain age. My father's 4-cylinder 1988 VW Jetta is running great, but all the little things have broken at this point, some for the second or third time. However, VW engines are apparently almost indestructible, if properly maintained. Mechanically, the New Beetle should be just fine, but don't be surprised if, just after the factory warranty runs out, you find yourself replacing a power window motor or something similar.

The Bug's primary competitors are (in no particular order): Honda Civic (a cool car, but nowhere near as much FUNFUNFUN!!), the Honda Accord Coupe (sleek, but somewhat yawn-inspiring), other VWs (great engines, but not as cute to be seen in public with), Chrysler PT Cruiser (can you say� BUCKET?! -no, I'm not a fan), Mitsubishi Eclipse (a cool car, but historically questionable in terms of reliability and build quality), the Toyota Celica (also lots and lots of fun, but it's a really small, low car, and what� no turbo?! -but I do like it, none the less), and the new Acura Integra replacement, the RSX (I have not been able to test one yet, but it looks like a blast to drive) and that's about all that come to mind.

Of all the above, the Bug is far and away the car with the most character -and if you listen to KNX 1070 (A local Los Angeles AM news & traffic station), you'll know what I mean when I say, "Character Counts" (inside joke� sorry).

[*Footnote: by the way, the new Acura RSX should prove to be one helluva good time� Definitely worthy of a test drive, IMHO -I am an Acura fan, by the way: my 1997 2.2CL was a great car.]

Base price for 2002 is: $16,100, and a fully loaded TOTL (top-of-the-line) Bug, excluding dealer options, should run you no more than about $23,000. This is a serious bang-for-your buck car. It provides a lot of fun for the money: fun to drive, fun to look at, fun to wash, fun to be seen in, and most importantly, fun to park somewhere and watch people walk by your car and check it out -everyone will.
 
I heartily recommend the New Beetle for anyone with either no kids or fairly small ones. It is a robust performer (in turbocharged form), and a practical car. As well, it ranks among the very highest scoring cars on every crash-test it has been subjected to (both government and private-industry). This of course, if the exact opposite of the PT Cruiser, which failed every crash test it took, miserably.

In summary, the New Beetle is not everything the original was. It is much more --of everything. �More power, more features (it actually has a fuel gauge!), more reliable, more room inside, more cargo capacity, and most importantly: lots more fun.

It is also a lot less of several things as well: it is a lot less noisy, less likely to leave you stranded on the side of the road, less likely to leak oil from just about anywhere, less likely to have the floorboards rust through, less fun to tinker with in your garage (for now), and less punishing to drive.

As for Stella's notorious groove problem �Stella, your new Bug awaits�

�So� Punchbuggy Blue? Yes please! I'll take two. To go. With fries.
