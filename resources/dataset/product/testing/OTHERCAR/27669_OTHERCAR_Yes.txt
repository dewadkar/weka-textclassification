            Years ago when I lived next to the alpine lakes wilderness in Washington state, I got into backpacking and photography bigtime. The scenery in this area is some of the most beautiful in the world. Glacial tarns with aquamarine water and sometimes deep purple. Anyway the only workhorse camera I could afford and which I still have was a Pentax sp-1000 SLR. I also bought the pentax reference manual and it was from this well written book that I learned about composition, depth of field, exposure, backlighting and so on. It was my bible of photography. I eventually got into just about every aspect of this craft except portraiture. The idea of photographing drooling babies never appealed to me. I did a lot of close up photography of butterflies and insects, even ants using extension tubes. 

I selected the Mavica 1000 for two reasons. First it has 10X optical zoom which is enough to make a butterfly just about fill the frame. Second it stores the pictures on a CD-R disk which you can finalize and read just like a CD�ROM. I never use the 20X digital zoom as it degrades the picture. 

Picture Quality 
Very good for a 2.1 mega pixel camera. Blow ups up to 8 X 10 inches are fine. Sure it�s not 35 mm quality but I think it�s still very good for 2.1 mega pixels. One of my �Painted Lady� butterfly pictures is used by our local Circuit City as a example of what this camera can do when used correctly. 

Storage Capacity 
The CD-R�s hold up to 170 images at the 1600 X 2000 resolution. If you go pure TIFF images about 20 only. It can save in a number of lower resolutions for the web and E-mail and can even make a high and low resolution image simultaneously. Images can also be saved in Black and white. 

Picture controls 
There are several modes day, night ,twilight etc. Some experimentation is required to use them all but they are very useful in different lighting situations. The white level control is something no film camera has. White level refers to the appearance of the image to the camera. The brain automatically "white levels" reality for us in most situations. We don't see fluorescent lights a being greenish but take pictures under them and they will look decidedly green. Tungsten light bulbs have a yellowish cast in a film picture. With the white level you can aim at a white sheet of paper, push the button, and the camera will correct the image back to something more normal than greenish or yellow. You can buy special tungsten film for cameras to do this but isn't digital great ? Push the button Max. PS. don't forget to reset the white level when you start shooting in normal light. 

Autofocus 
Works very well most of the time but can become confused when photographing subjects in foliage when there is no clear plane of focus that predominates for the camera to recognize. In this case you can turn it off and use manual focus. 

Shot repeat rate 
About one shot per second. 

Viewfinder 
Has a LCD and a Viewfinder which displays the various electronic functions. The Viewfinder also has a small lever underneath it which adjusts the diopter value of the viewfinder. This allows me to look through the viewfinder without my glasses on and still see clearly, a big plus for some types of eyeglass wearers. (No it won�t help astigmatism !). The viewfinder is smart and senses when the light level is low enough that your eye is in front of the viewfinder, otherwise it turns off the electronic image display to save power. Has a rubber shield. In bright light you should wear a hat so the display doesn�t turn off due to light leakage around the rubber cup. 

Flash 
Pops up from the top of the camera but isn�t a very powerful flash at all. It does have a hotshoe so you can mount your own flash with more power.(Just think, a strobe and two slave units with a couple of airbrellas and you�ll think you�re Matt Helm). 

Lens 
It�s a sony and can�t be changed but it seems ok. Accepts filters like a pink skylight or a polarizer and can accept multiplier lenses so you can do 20X or about 35mm (moderate wide angle). 

Menu controls 
All accessed by a rocker button on the back of the camera which can be difficult to use until you practice a bit. It has up, down, left, right arrows and the center is enter/accept. The camera can run a slide show and output the images through a standard RCA plug to your television for viewing. 

LCD Viewer 
I use this to set up the camera but not when I am shooting pictures. This is because the LCD is a real power hog and you�ll get more picture time with it turned off. 

Battery usage 
Is enough for a morning of shooting with the LCD display turned off. The number of minutes of battery remaining are displayed in the viewfinder and LCD screen if you configure this option. During normal shooting I turn off all menu displays. The camera comes with a recharger that plugs into the wall for home recharging and a cigarette lighter recharger for the car. Extra batteries are expensive, $ 70.00. 

Shooting pictures 
Pushing the shutter button down half way engages Autofocus and a green light blinks when the camera thinks it has a lock. Push down the rest of the way and you just took a picture. This too takes a little practice but comes very naturally once you get used to it. The shutter button does not accept a cable release. A cable release is nice in tripod mounted situations where no vibration is critical. 

In summation 
I find this to be a very good digital camera for what I wanted it to do and for the resolution it has.
