            I don't own this car, but my girlfriend's dad happened to bring one home. As a lover of nice, fast cars he apparently was drawn to the TT. I'm lucky, occassionaly he lets me take his cars for a spin. I have had the opportunity to drive some nice high-end cars like mustangs and BMWs. The TT was the best yet! It's acceleration was great, as fast as you'd want a car to go. Its handling was tight and responsive in the turns, mostly due to its stockiness and wide base. The small frame helped for sure. The brakes are sensitive and the clutch is smooth. Both help make the extremes of driving really perform; if you want to stop the sencitve brakes stop you. The smooth and some-what loose clutch  really let you take off quick. 

It's unique styling always draws a lot of looks from those around you. Though a small car, the interior is quite roomy as well as the trunk. The dash isn't in your face and the seats are comfortable. Its almost futuristic interior styling takes some getting used to. The TT comes with a kick ass Bose stereo system. 

I wish I had more to say about it but he hasn't let me take it out in a long while. But I do look forward to the next time. <br><br>
