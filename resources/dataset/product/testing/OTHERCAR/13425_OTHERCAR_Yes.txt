            I had always wanted a Blazer but my husband and I could never agree on buying the same car/truck and then my husband's uncle sells cars and he called us to tell us about this great deal he had so we went to see and it was a 96 blazer 4 door and I was so excited so anyway we decided to get it, we have a family of four and it is great to have something that everyone has their own door and window to look out of. All in all it is the way to go if you have a family and travel alot. besides being great on gas their ride is comfortable we went on a trip about a month after we bought it and our kids road in the back seat and sleep all the way it was great they had all kinds of room.. so if you are looking for a car/truck a chevy blazer is the way to go..<br><br>
