                I purchased my 94' Wrangler in 1998. At the time I was unfamiliar with the types of off-road activities that came along with the vehicle. I wanted a vehicle that could go off the beaten path and not get beaten! Since buying the jeep, I have spent most of my free time customizing it to meet my personality. 
    The things that I love about my jeep are the simple things like being able to fold down the top in an instant on a hot day, to go places that a normal vehicle couldn't because of ground clearance, and having a vehicle that I could constantly improve and customize to my specifications. I can't really say that I hate anything about my jeep, but if your not used to the overall ride in a jeep, it does take some getting used to.
    Driving my jeep is one of my favorite things. When you have a jeep, it feels as if you are part of a society of sorts. You always seem to get looks and waves from fellow jeepsters and it's interesting to see how many different people customize their jeeps as well.
    Anyone who wants to own a vehicle that can take them anywhere they need to go and longs for a vehicle that they can spend their time customizing, this is the vehicle for you. On the other hand, if you just want a vehicle that gets you from point to point with no special features this may not be the best vehicle for you!
