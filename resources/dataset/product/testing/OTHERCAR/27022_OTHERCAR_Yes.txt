            This is a great Camera. But it does not come with enough accessories. I bought the D-450 Zoom for Christmas for just over $400.00, which was a good deal at the time. Then I found I wanted the AC adapter that was $70  and the Flashpath adapter which was $70 otherwise I would need stock in Eveready. A leather case is another $20 Also the instruction book is a little short on help with the many features this camera has. The panorama feature is not like a 35mm panorama camera the camera comes with software for stitching the photos together to make them into a panorama photo.
Overall this camera takes great pictures in many different sizes and lighting conditions. <br><br>
