            This is a terrific van for the money. Plenty of room, very comfortable, and rides well.
 
Has a well thought out instrument panel and the van is  sold in a myriad of configurations to suit the individual or families needs.

I HAVE HEARD OF THESE MINIVANS BEING USEFUL WELL  OVER A 100,000 MILES.
Doing an oil change myself everything was easily accessible and easy to remove and install. Under the hood liquids are easy to get to for routine maintenance. The four  cylinder engine has enough zip ro get the job done.

THE windows provide for a completely unobstructed view, SEATS SLIDE OUT, EASILY BUT YOU WILL NEED TWO PEOPLE....A windows are tinted. The basic radio/cassette package has decent sound  quality.
ALL IN ALL YOU CAN'T FIND A BETTER VALUE IN THIS CLASS OF VEHICLE.<br><br>
