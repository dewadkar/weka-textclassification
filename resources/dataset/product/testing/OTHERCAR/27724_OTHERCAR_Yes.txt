            This thing's great...but has a few limitations, like lack of a diopter for those of us oldsters starting to have eye trouble and no manual controls.

But for 95% of photographers, this thing is a jewel!  First, it LOOKS like a jewel.  small and exquisitely made.  Second, it takes jewel like images that are easily enlargable to an honest 8x10&quot; print...and captures 2.11 megapixels.  By the way, it grabs great skin tones...which I MUST have.  I hate the look of whacky colored skin in shots.  You won't have the problem with this little Elph.

This Elph also has a very fast recycle time, meaning you can take pictures quickly, one after another rather than having to wait and wait and wait as you have to do with many other digital cameras.  

The zoom lens is high quality...but is only a 2x, which I wish were at least a 3x...but, hey, how much can you squeeze into a single jewel?!

I particularly love the way I can slip this thing into my pocket and not feel (or look) like I am carrying around a brick.  It is only 1&quot; think, light, lovely, and great!   Because it so easy to carry, I find myself taking a lot more pictures (because I have it with me all the time) and, as a result, getting a lot more great &quot;keepers&quot;.

Another nice feature is 5 different flash settings for capturing just about any type indoor image you want. If you like PANORAMA's - it has a fabulous onboard tool that makes taking them a snap, not to mention a snazzy &quot;slide show&quot; play back function, which I can no longer live without!!!

The Elph's 8mb compactflash memory card is wonderful and it is easy to pocket extras, if you feel you need them.  I carried one extra around for awhile, but didn't use it, so I just carry the Elph now...which, by the way, weighs just 7 ounces!!!

It outputs serial, USB, and video...and the pictures are terrific.  What a lovely little precision instument this is!  You won't get mine away from me EVER!  You can have those SONY monsters...give me an Elph anyday!  <br><br>
