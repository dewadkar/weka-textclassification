            Let me just start out by saying that my opinion is not a technical one, it is just about what I like/dislike about my truck.  Roadiem wrote an excellent technical review that is very readable by the layperson.

For Christmas this year, my wonderful hubby bought me a 2001 Chevy Silverado 4x4 ext. cab pickup.  THANK YOU HUBBY!!!  I have been wanting a pickup truck for some time and since we have been putting a lot of money into fixing one of our older cars we decided it was time to go ahead and get one.

This truck is awesome!  The cab itself is very roomy.  The backdoors open up and make it very easy to put the little one in her carseat.  No more bending over into a car for us!  The backseat is comfortable for adult passengers as well.  I had to take family to the airport about an hour and half away and they rode in the back without feeling cramped up at all.  

This truck is quiet.  Road noise is all but blocked out.  My husband likes how well it accelerates and I like that it rides very smooth.  You don't feel like you're going 70 mph when you are.  The four-wheel drive has already come in handy with all the snow we've been having up here.  The truck handles well in 4- or 2-wheel drive.  I am still adjusting to parking this big truck after driving a car for the last 2 years.

I'm sure that there are going to be a lot more things that I like and probably a few things that I don't like.  I've only had it about a week though so I will have to add on to this when I find them.  :)

Well, I finally found the thing I like least about my truck.  The passenger side seatbelt.  This seatbelt locks up and gets tighter on you and the only way to make it stop is to unfasten it and refasten it which is, to say the least, annoying to have to do.

I took my truck into the dealership and explained the problem and was informed that this a common problem.  In fact, it is so common that they have a "fix" for it.  Now, as soon as I get my digital camera charged up, I will take a picture of this "fix" and put it on my webpage so that you can see it.  What a joke!  All it is is an extender for the seatbelt.  It serves no real purpose.  I am getting ready to write to GM and let them know what I think of it too.

Also, if you live in the Ft. Worth area, don't take your truck to Bruce Lowrie!  The first time I took my truck in they kept it all day and all they did was change the oil!  They said they couldn't find any problem with the seatbelt so they didn't fix it.  My husband talked to the service manager and asked him to order a new seatbelt (my husband, by the way, worked at the plant that made these seats up until we moved here in March so he knows what they do to fix the problem at the plant - put on a new seatbelt!)  The service manager agreed and said he'd call when it came in.  He called me the following week and asked me to bring the truck back in.  I waited for about an hour and they said it was done.  Did they give me a new seatbelt?  NO!!  All they did was to put the extender on there which I could have done in under 2 minutes myself.  And, no, they didn't tell me that they did not install a new one.  I guess they thought I wouldn't figure it out.  To say the least, I'm not happy with Bruce Lowrie's dealership!

~~~~~Other than that, I STILL LOVE MY TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
