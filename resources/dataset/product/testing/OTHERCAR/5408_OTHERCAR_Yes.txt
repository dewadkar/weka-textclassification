            [Note: this review was written when the A50 wasn't listed as a specific item on epinions. Since, then, the A50 category was added; I've created a separated opinion there. - WF]

My experience with the Canon Powershot A50 has generally been good. It takes good pictures. It's &quot;point and shoot&quot; features seem to be done well; it takes pictures without flash indoors with good results, for instance. It comes with good software for image management, too, although there's no simple way to just dump images to a file for later processing.

I hated the 'user-interface' at first, but I've come to see that it's not too bad. There are '+/-' buttons on the top that are required for menu selection and scrolling--it's not obvious at first, especially if you're looking just from the back. Plus, these double up for other functions. Also, it's not always clear when the camera has actually taken a picture. It does emit a beep (unless you turn it off). A friend of mine with hearing loss could not hear the beep.

The biggest downside is that it uses lithium batteries which are not rechargable. I used up a $10 battery in a couple of days (I was taking pictures out of doors in the cold, which is apparently a no-no for lithium batteries). A 'recharging kit' is available for $100, but apparently they are hard to find.<br><br>
