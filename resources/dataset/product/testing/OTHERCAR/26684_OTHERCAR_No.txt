            One of my extended family members has this car, and I have been a passenger in it many times.  My first complaint is that when an adult sits in the back seat, their head and neck are completely unprotected!!!  The back of the seat comes up to my shoulders, and I have thought about what would happen if we were to get rear-ended while I was sitting there.  Whip-lash with no neck protection would have disastrous effects.  I do all I can to avoid riding in this car.

The back seats are built for children, who fit perfectly and are protected by them.  The front seats are slightly uncomfortable.

Another complaint I have about this car is that the tires are so loud
that I feel like I am riding in a tank.  I have been told time and time again that this is a safe car, but I do not feel safe in it at all.  

The suspension is terrible, every small bump in the road feels like a giant boulder.  The overall experience of riding in this car is a negative one, mainly because of the way that it rides so rough, even on mostly smooth surfaces.  

Perhaps this car is suited more for actually being an SUV, an ACTUAL Sports Utility Vehicle, but here in Southern California, most people who own them seem to use them just for going to the mall.  This is too bad, because they also have terrible gas mileage and are an eyesore.  <br><br>
