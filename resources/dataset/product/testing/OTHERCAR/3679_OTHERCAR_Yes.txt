            I recently purchased a 2001 Honda Civic EX, to replace my 1998 Chevy Cavalier.  I can honestly say that this is the best automotive purchase that I have ever made.

The Honda Civic was completely redesigned for the 2001 model year, and is still available in the three trim levels that have been available for many years now.  The DX is the base model, the LX is the mid level model, and the EX is the top of the line.  All 2001 Civics have a 1.7 liter engine, up from last year's 1.6.  The DX and the LX have a 16 valve SOHC engine that delivers 115 hp @ 6100 rpm, while the EX model has the VTEC engine which delivers 127 hp @ 6300 rpm.  Interior room in the Civic is greatly improved over previous years models.  Engineers at Honda figured out a way to relocate the exhaust system, and as a result, the "floor hump" in the back seat has been eliminated, which creates more leg room for improved comfort for back seat passengers.

I opted for the EX model, which includes the following equipment standard:

-- power windows, with driver's window auto-down feature

-- power locks

-- power body-colored mirrors

-- tilt steering wheel

-- cruise control

-- CD player, with anti theft feature

-- power moonroof with tilt feature and sliding sunshade

-- remote keyless entry system with panic alarm

-- Antilock brakes (ABS)

-- body colored door handles

-- interior trunk release with lock

-- interior fuel door release

-- 60/40 split folding rear seat with lock

So far, I have gotten outstanding gas mileage, averaging 30+ mpg in the city.  The 1.7 liter VTEC engine has surprisingly good acceleration; much better than in my Chevy Cavalier, which had a 2.2 liter engine.  One of my favorite features is the remote keyless entry system, with the panic alarm.  Pressing the unlock button once unlocks the driver's door and turns on the interior lights, pressing it twice unlocks all other doors.  If you accidentally press the unlock button on the remote, the doors automatically relock in thirty seconds.  Pressing the lock button on the remote locks all doors and if you press it twice, the horn will toot to confirm the doors are locked.  Press and hold the panic button, and the lights will flash and the horn will honk for thirty seconds, or until you press the lock button on the remote.  Unfortunately, there is no trunk release button on the remote, but when I think about all of the other great features offered on this car, I feel that is something I can easily live with.

The 2001 Honda Civic EX is the best car that I have ever owned.  It is supposed to be an economy car, but feels like a very sophisticated and refined automobile.  Compared to my Chevy Cavalier, it is practically like a luxury car.  I would recommend the 2001 Honda Civic to anyone who wants to get the most car for their money.
