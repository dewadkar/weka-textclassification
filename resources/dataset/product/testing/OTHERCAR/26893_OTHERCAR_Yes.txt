            My Dodge Caravan was an absolute godsend.  We had been driving a 2-door car and it just wasn't working anymore.  When the children tell you that they are not fitting in the back-seat anymore, it is time to go car shopping.  The Caravan has so much room, I am still excited that we bought it, and we have had the van for 6 months now.  It has given us no mechanical problems and tends to be good on gasoline mileage.  

It is so easy to pack up and go out of town with the Caravan.  It is very easy to handle and holds the road well.  The V-6 transmission gives it the get up and go that it needs on the highway.  

I never imagined that I would be a Mini-van Mom, but the Dodge Caravan makes me a proud holder of that title.  We are already planning on purchasing a new one when this one has done it's job.<br><br>
