            I bought my Chevy Tracker four door model in October of 1997. I bought it as a vehicle to got to and from work. It has served that purpose and another one. Since I am a marine, during my two hour lunch break I go 4 wheeling during lunch. Its great. I have only had to get pulled out once and that was because the hole was 2 feet deep that my front tire dropped down into. On a different note it gets great gas mileage. It has been from San Diego Ca. to Jacksonville Fl twice and twice up to the San Francisco Mountains. So far my Tracker has held out far beyond. Though I traveled in my 4 door tracker with my wife and two kids across country, I would not recommend that again for the fact of its compact size. But my tracker has made it through two cross country trips and several Snow mountain driving trips. I have yet to have to replace anything. The wipers the tires and even the Air conditioner are all still good.<br><br>
