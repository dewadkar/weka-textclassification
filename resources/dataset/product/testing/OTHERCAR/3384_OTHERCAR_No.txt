            Why you will want to buy this car when you see it....

Captivating at first sight, this striking beauty will steal your heart.  But the heart is treacherous.  Do not be so easily fooled as I.  This car has a great paint job with a clear coat that never quits.  Which is one reason that it can be easily resold on an upswing(after you've tired of hauling it to the shop every couple weeks.) The engine is a powerful V6 with plenty of pickup that purrs like a kitten.... when it runs, that is.
 
But, why you shouldn't buy this car.... 

The computerized transmission will blow (usually by 100k){Chrysler's fault
The rag top will split open, all by itself {Chrysler's fault
The power window motors die (conveniently with windows down)
The speakers are crappy (even with an excellent stereo)
The rag top leaks (carwash, light drizzle, you name it)
Once the engine problems start, THEY NEVER END.
In the last 6 MONTHS, I've replaced:
timing belt 
water pump
head gaskets
cylinder head
thermostat
temperature gauge
(To say nothing of the &quot;interior problems&quot; I've had; leaks, ect.)
The second one thing is fixed, two more things of equal or greater value break.  This car ran like a dream when I bought it.  Two months later the problems started with *no warning what-so-ever*, and have kept coming for four months straight.  If you have already purchased this vehicle, your ONLY escape is to sell it on one of its RARE good days.  I'm just hoping that I can strangle one more good day out of mine, so I can bid it good riddance forever.  Wash it, wax it, and send it on its way!
