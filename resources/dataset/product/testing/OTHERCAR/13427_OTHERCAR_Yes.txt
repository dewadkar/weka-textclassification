            I call my blazer &quot;truck&quot; because that's what it is. I have driven it extensively off road and on several occasions have had the pleasure of pulling my brother in laws Grand Jeep Cherokee out of various situations. Considering what I've put it through no complaints. A service guy the other day asked me how do I like the '99, I wax it a lot. Great in snow, keep it going it can handle two feet, stop and you might have an issue. No major problems, electric mirrors don't work any more, AC needs a recharge, seat headrests are the wimpiest excuse for whiplash protection I've ever encountered, some road noise that I didn't help by putting on somewhat beefy tires, replacing the serpentine 10,000 miles ago finally got rid of squeaky belt problem. Drives very well, could have better brakes, though the anti-locks without a shadow of a doubt prevented me from absolutely creaming a very little car a couple of weeks ago. Overall, I love this truck, would recommend it to anyone, GO OFF ROAD.<br><br>
