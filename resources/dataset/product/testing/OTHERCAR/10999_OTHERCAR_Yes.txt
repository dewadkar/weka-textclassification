            There is no other minivan that will hold as many kids comfortably as the Astro Mini-Van.  I have the two bench seat option, and I can fit 7 kids and myself in and everyone has their own seatbelt!  This is a great car if you do a lot of carpools and driving.

Another good point about this van is that it is large.  You sit higher than most cars, so you have good visibility and it makes you feel safer.  I haven't read all the crash results, but I know that I was in a low-speed rear end collision with a semi and it only moved my bumper a bit.  It is also large in the passenger compartment, so it is easy to get into the back seat without adjusting the middle seats.  There is plenty of room for luggage.  My family has no problem getting all the gear for a week-long vacation in the back and we don't need a luggage rack.

If you get this van, I would highly recommend getting the optional rear heater and rear air conditioner.  We only have the heater and use it often in the cold Chicago weather.  My kids wish we had the air conditioner too!

We've had our van for over 4 years, and the only work we've had done was routine maintenance such as tires and oil changes.<br><br>
