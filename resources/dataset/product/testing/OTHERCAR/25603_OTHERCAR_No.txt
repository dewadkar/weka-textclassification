            ---APRIL 2002 UPDATE---
As my 3-year lease winds down, I thought I'd write a final update on my experiences with my 1999 Saab 9-3 S.

The heater knob has snapped off for the third time. The rear washer has recently stopped working, and the rear wiper occasionally moves v e r y  s l o w l y, taking 10-20 seconds to complete a single wipe.

The camber steer is still homocidal, and the torque steer is totally unacceptable.

Final thoughts are much like my early thoughts. The motor is great, even though turbo lag is a common annoyance. The sound system is pathetic. Reliability is a joke. 

Plusses: The seats are absolutely superb. Hauling capacity is sometimes astonishing. I still think the car is gorgeous, and I feel this as strongly as I did on day 1. I love the styling. I also still like driving around in such a unique car.

What are my plans for after the lease? Well, I've rediscovered my love of all things Honda. My 1996 Honda Civic DX is my new daily driver (I pawned the Saab off on the wife, partly because her commute is shorter and I'm way over my mileage limit). I love the Honda, and more than that I deeply and sincerely appreciate its unflappable reliability. Plus, it is superbly engineered, and for some reason my ego no longer demands that I drive a car that somehow proves to the world that I've "arrived."

Cars do say something about their owners. My Saab, I guess, used to say that I'm a unique guy with at least a decent job. Now, however, I no longer feel compelled to prove myself to strangers on the road. If my Honda Civic DX says anything about me, I suppose it is that I know value when I see it, and I prefer to save and invest my money instead of wasting it on depreciating assets like cars.

I plan to pick up a used Mazda Miata soon. You can't beat a little convertible for summer fun, and I am permanently sold on Japanese reliability. However, I may buy a used Accord...

One final word. My Saab dealer is Just Saab of Dayton/Cincinnati. I may not have liked the car very much, but Just Saab delivered absolutely the finest service experience of my life. I cannot begin to explain the ways in which Just Saab demonstrated their appreciation for my business. They were unfailingly polite, knowledgeable, helpful, sincere, and honest, frequently going waaay beyond what I would consider good service, into the realm of truly extraordinary service. If you are in the market for a Saab (the larger Saab 9-5 is extremely reliable and is all around a great car), I cannot recommend Just Saab of Dayton/Cincinnati highly enough. They have earned my lasting appreciation.


---JULY 2001 UPDATE---

Since my last update, the cupholder has broken again, the right windshield washer nozzle stopped working permanently, the rear washer nozzle stopped working for 3 weeks but then sprang to life anew like a phoenix from the ashes or, perhaps, a dung-beetle from a steaming pile of wildebeast excreta.  

The suspension started making a popping sound, the manual transmission started grinding at 3rd gear, and the right rear speaker box has started rattling again. The car -- with a sticker of over $32,000 just 22 short months ago -- is now worth a tick over $16,000. That's a depreciation rate of $727 a month, a rate that ought to be criminal.

The silver lining has been the dealer, Just Saab (Cincinnati and Dayton), which has offered me the absolute best customer service experience of my life. Until the Dayton dealership opened a week ago, they had somebody drive from Cincinnati to Dayton (a 90 mile round trip) to pick up my car for service and drop off the free loaner (always a higher-end Saab with less than 2000 miles). I could go on and on.

My advice: Never buy or lease a Saab 9-3 if your safety and finances are important to you. However, by all accounts the 9-5 has proven to be an exceptionally reliable car, and apparently just claimed a gold medal in the most recent JD Power survey of luxury sedans. I also happen to think the 9-5 is gorgeous. I won't buy one, because I'm sick of pi**ing my money away (I'm going used next time), but you could certainly do worse than a 9-5. Just remember to avoid the 9-3 like the freaking plague.

I'm currently looking to unload my lease.

---THIRD THOUGHTS: APRIL 2001 UPDATE---

Well, I've lived with the Saab 9-3 for 17 months. Has my epinion changed?

Hell yes it has. Let me count the ways:

Inside driver's door handle: Broke twice.
Antenna: Broke once.
HVAC box: Broke twice.
Dash and speakers: Continually rattle.
Doors: Continually squeak.
Head gasket: Blew at 19,000 miles.
C pillar: Whistles at highway speeds.
Windshield washer nozzles: Clogged.
Headlight washer arms: Come to a rest at random angles.

This is the most unreliable car I have ever owned/leased. On top of it all, the torque steer and camber steer are downright dangerous. There should have been a federally-mandated recall on these cars, and woe to the fool who dares attempt a passing maneuver without both hands on the wheel, because if the road is even slightly uneven the car will dart from side to side.

I still love the seats and the engine, as well as the car's amazing cargo capacity. But overall, it really is a mess, uncontrollable and unreliable and faaaar too expensive.

These cars can easily be purchased for $5000-7000 below invoice, and it's no wonder. The 4-year, 50,000-mile warranty helps a little, but unless you absolutely have to have a unique car or a hatchback, you'd do better to consider an Audi or BMW, or at least wait until the middle of next year for the next-generation 9-3 if you're generous of spirit.

Generally speaking, what I've learned here is what I actually knew all along. If you want to avoid headaches, never, ever, ever buy a GM product, no matter where it's put together.

--- (second thoughts, early 2000) ---

After a few more months behind the wheel, I have a few thoughts to add.  Most important, this car has an unacceptable level of torque steer. Saab went through great expense in designing an active headrest that reduces whiplash in certain kinds of collisions. Whey did they not spend the small change required to reduce the abundant torque steer this car suffers from? (Torque steer is the tendency of the car to jerk the steering wheel under heavy acceleration). Abbott Racing in the UK sells a very helpful "rescue pack" for the 9-3, with stiffer bushings and a better steering column brace. It's well worth the investment, but baffling why Saab didn't do this in the first place.

---ORIGINAL EPINION FOLLOWS---

I just got a 1999 Saab 9-3 S (base). I'd say overall I am very happy with it. It's very quick, handles reasonably well, looks cool (black with black leather), and has a nice set of options.

The problems: The 15" wheels are too small, the tires too narrow. I spent $1600 extra upgrading to the 16" wheels and tires, and then auctioned my 15" set on Ebay and recovered $650. Even with the wider tires (205/50-ZR16 Yokohamas) it's extraordinarily easy to light up the tires. In the wet even 3rd gear can get jumpy. And there's no traction control, a disappointment in an ABS-equipped car geared for safety.

The cupholders are a joke, almost useless. A 12-ounce can will fit ok, but anything larger is out of the question.  The supporting arm on the dash cupholder swings in such a way that cups and cans are easily dumped, and it blocks the radio and CD slot when in use.

The turn signal doesn't stop until the wheel is returned to top dead center, not three-quarters as in most cars. This is irritating.

And why, for the love of God, do car makers install change holders with ONLY 3 coin sizes?! Memo to Saab and all other auto interior designers: Here in the United States, we have quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in common circulation (and now a bunch of dollar coins). That's four -- count 'em -- FOUR change sizes, not three. This is such an idiotic design element I hardly know how to express my irritation. So, yes, I can neatly arrange my quarters, dimes, and nickels, but I have pennies lying all over the place -- most notably in the otherwise useless center console cupholder.

The foot pedals are too offset, especially the brake. They need to move them about 1 1/2 inches to the right. The dead pedal is sloped and too small.

The shifter is notchy and rubbery at the same time.

Finally, gas mileage is astonishingly poor for a little 2-liter motor. I'm lucky to get 20 mpg in mixed city/highway driving (mostly city ... well, suburb).

On the plus side, the interior is beautiful, and the trim is artfully constructed and pleasant to look at. The switchgear is solid and tactile. The trip computer is a snap to use and is very helpful. The radio's controls are good, even if the sound quality is Escort-ish. The steering wheel should be mounted, framed, and UPS'd to every steering wheel designer in North America, especially the drones at GM. It has perfect proportions and works beautifully.

The trunk -- it is so heavenly I am ashamed to look at it directly; I must avert my gaze. You could fit a horse in the trunk. You could (I think) fit Hillary Clinton's fat ankles into that trunk.

With the 16" wheels and 50-series rubber, the car is beautiful, clean, functional-looking. It looks smart and hip and sort of funky. It reminds me of those ads for Dodge vehicles -- you know, the ones that say "Dodge is different"? Saabs are genuinely "different" in much the same way that Dodges are utterly, perfectly ordinary.

And it's fun to beat trailer-punks in 87 Camaros at stoplights.

Finally, let me speak of this car's seats. Forgive me if I lapse into iambic pentameter. The seats are sublime. Sitting in any other car (ANY other car) now feels like sitting on a wet log in the middle of the woods. I feel like Jesus at the right hand of God when I sit in the seats. The seat back goes ALL THE WAY UP! Yep, you read that correctly. Unlike all other cars, the seat back does NOT stop 2/3rds of the way up my back, with a dingy little headrest at the top like a bird perched on a fencepost. The seat actually goes all the way up to my shoulders. And the headrest sprouts from the top of the seat like a mighty oak tree or the Arch de Triumph in Paris.  I want to be buried sitting on that seat. I'm not joking.

Would I recommend the car?  If Saab sold just that seat and still charged $30,000, I'd recommend it. The rest of the car...that's icing on the cake. I would indeed recommend it, despite the tinny radio, worthless cupholders, change holders, and skinny (standard) tires.
