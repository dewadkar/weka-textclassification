            My husband and I were out shopping for a SUV and decided to see what the Mazda dealer in Stockton had available.  There was nothing in stock that we were interested in, but as we were leaving, I spotted the Mazda 929.  It is a beautiful sleek car.  The color of burgundy (called bordeaux) was a perfect compromise between my husband's love of blue and mine of red.  We purchased the car for $21,000 with our Toyota 4-Runner trade in.  The car was 1 year old and had 17,000 miles on it.  The retail price for the vehicle at the time was $28,000.  Our credit union financed it with no trouble.

Since it was used, we decided to purchase the bumper to bumper 3 year, 45,000 mile warranty offered with the car.  Guess what?  It must have only covered the bumper because the warranty did not cover any of the many things that went wrong with it.

First off, 3 months into the car, the passenger side window (auto) stopped working.  This cost us $450 to repair.  No warranty there.  Then the anti-theft built in car alarm started going off intermittently when you opened the car on the driver side.  The cost to fix this was approximately $300.  No warranty there.  Then the ABS light kept coming on at the weirdest times.  After $500 for labor and 3 trips to the dealer, still no resolution.  Finally, fed up with all the stupid little problems (didn't mention the cup holder not sliding properly, didn't fix it because of the cost of $175), I asked for my money back on the warranty that wasn't doing us any good anyway.  Guess what?  The Stockton Mazda dealer went out of business - No surprise there.  Never did get my money back.

The best ending to this review is the fact that I am unable to drive this car in the rain.  Yep, it's a fair weather car only.  When you step on the gas to go, you peel out every single time.  The traction goes right out of the tires (even with getting new $500 tires).  Then to cap it all off, don't go around the corners fast, you will slide right into the ditch.  It happened to me twice.  I was doing 35 on a 30 mph corner and there I went.  The second time, I was doing about 35 on a 40 mph corner, there I went again.  It was very scary.  

Now my beautiful car sits in the drive way on rainy days unless my 1978 Chevrolet truck decides not to work that day.<br><br>
