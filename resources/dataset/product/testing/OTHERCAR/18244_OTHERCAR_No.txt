            Have a '94 850 Wagon that we bought off-lease when it was three years old.  Buying through Volvo's factory program is a great deal -- you get at least one year of warranty on low mileage cars.
We have been very happy with the car.  It looks great, is fun to drive, has plenty of space for us and our two young kids.  I only have two complaints.  First, it is a little noisy in normal driving.  There are a lot of little squeaks and rattles.  Second, while all of the major mechanical items seem to be very solid and dependable, a lot of the little gadgety items are less reliable.  For example, we have replaced the radio twice (Volvo replaced it the second time even though we were outside the warranty), we recently had to pay $185 to replace a drive belt in the power driver's seat, the headlight wiper motors both burned out . . .
That being said, the car is still a great deal for the level of luxury and performance you get.
WROTE THIS OPINION A FEW WEEKS AGO, NOW, TODAY, (11/17/99) I FIND OUT THAT THIS CAR NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION at 56,000 MILES.  THIS IS A $2,000 FIX.  DO NOT BUY A CAR LIKE THIS.  THEY ARE PRETTY AND FUN, BUT THEY COST WAY TOO MUCH TO MAINTAIN.
