            There are two BMW 323CIs in my household which is why I will give two reviews (Mine, happens to be the one without problems =) ). I will not go into the details of features since they are publicly stated in other reviews, so I will get right to the point.

We have owned our cars for a little over a year now.  A month after we both purchased our cars, we noticed a squeaking noise coming from the brakes.  It turns out that the compound originally used in the brakes was too hard, which caused the awful noise.  After the compound replacement, we never heard the squeaking again.  With the warranty offered by BMW, all the services performed within this review was free.

The second BMW continued to encounter problems throughout the year.  The left rear brake was replaced three times.  The doors seem lighter and rattles when closing.  The AC unit broke (didn't help his opinion since conveniently, it occurred in the middle of a heat storm and was on back order).  The electrical system that tells you when you are due for maintenance stopped working and stated that he was due for service in 1,500 miles even after the 1,500 miles were passed.  He finally called BMW to ask if all his problems constituted a 'lemon', but we have been waiting a response for about a month now.

I have gone through all the seasons in both cars, so luckily I was able to enjoy different experiences.  Since I was originally a Honda driver, who was used to Anti-Lock Braking, the first time BMW's security feature initiated, I was alarmed.  For a brief moment, I felt as though I had no control over the car because it stopped taking commands from the driver.  By the time, I realized what was happening, my car was back in control and so was I.  The BMW uses a more passive approach where it releases power from the wheels that slip.  I love the fact that I don't get whiplash from ABS anymore.  On the other hand, for those who enjoy figure eights, I am sure it is not quite as easy to do anymore (I am in no way recommending this).

Some general comments.  The sport coupe model, has a very tight suspension and hugs the corners very nicely.  For those who are smaller in height and prefer driving a stick, good news!  This is only of the few cars, that I can comfortably reach all the pedals without straining to shift.  The steering wheel is very adjustable as well as the range in which you can move the seats.  For instance he likes the sportier feel and has his seats low to the ground and wheel practically in his lap.  I on the other hand prefer the luxury with a touch of sport.  So, my seat and wheels are lifted higher.   

The room in the back seats are a bit tight if the driver is tall (around 6 feet).  As for trunk space, I can fit two golf bags, golf cart, and a few bags of groceries comfortably.  The longer drivers might have to be pulled out of the bag and placed in separately.

Here are some of the little things that you end up appreciating later. Large sunroof, but the aerodynamics doesn't allow the wind the completely turn the inside of your car into a wind tunnel.  The back windows in the coupe have a triangle window that opens outwards.  Great feature to air out your car quickly!  A change holder that holds tokens by size!  Zenon lights that are bright when driving in the dark, yet has more of a blue tint so it is softer on other drivers' eyes.  This I do appreciate because I was driving in my friend's Lexus and I was getting highbeamed constantly. 

Watch out when you start pricing in your features, they do add up quickly!  Oh, the dealership that I went through did not tell me about the Platinum interior and console instead of the standard gray and black.  I saw one the other day and it was beautiful and futuristic.  If that interests you, don't forget to check that out.
