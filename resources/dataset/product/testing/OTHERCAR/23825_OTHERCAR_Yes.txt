            I decided on this car for economy.  I have a daughter in college, and household expenditures was a top consideration for me.  Then, there was my husband who insisted if I'm going to be driving a car this small, it better be safe.  I first visited Toyota's web site to learn as much as I could about the car and my husband grilled the local salesman at Johnstons Toyota in Middletown, NY as to is safety.  AJ explained that comparison crash results showed this car faired as well as the Camry for safety and Mr Jardine the owner added that it was right up there when put up against the international competition for safety.  This allayed any fears my husband was having. At the end of the test drive, I was convinced this was the car for me.  I ordered the 2 door Echo you have pictured, same color. I ordered basics, air conditioning and am-fm radio.  The instrument panel is located in center of car to right of steering column, took little or no time to get used to it.  I'm short so reading instrument panel thru steering wheel was always a problem for me.  I must admit though at night it seems odd not to have dash in front of steering wheel lit.  The heating and cooling system is great.  I especially like the windshield wipers, because of the size of the car they overlap and visability is clear at all times.  Great acceleration for a car this size.  Another feature I like is roominess inside.  Head and leg room is better than average, however, if two tall people are sitting in front, ther is little leg room in back seat for adults.  I have a co-worker who is 6ft 7in tall and he was surprised after sitting in car how roomy it was.  Trunk space adequate for my needs.  Sound system is good.  Last but not least, I've only had car approximately a month and I'm averaging 32 miles to the gallon on short runs.  I haven't taken a long trip yet but I'm sure it will fare well.<br><br>
