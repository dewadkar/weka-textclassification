            I like many of you, was attracted to this nifty looking little blue camera.(Mustek G-Smart 350)  Based on what I thought was a good price and some opinions posted on the internet I decided to take a chance and purchase one. The first thing I noticed was the distorted pics.  Every picture was badly distorted in the lower left hand quadrant and the rest of the picture was below average as well.  If you would like to see some of the pics please e-mail me at geligam@hotmail.com.

The flash on the Mustek G-Smart 350 works only if you are a few feet away from your subject and even at this close range pics are very dark. 

I figured I only paid $140.00 for the Mustek G-Smart 350, so I didn't complain.  Thats when it quit working.  Right in the middle of some photo ops on vacation in Kentucky it died.  

Customer service at Mustek has made it difficult to get a return authorization number.  
This process includes holding for prolonged periods, long distance, from Miami Fl. to Irvine Ca.  After finally getting the number, paying postage and insurance, I have still not received my new unit.  I have received my postal return receipt 3 weeks ago.  Overall, the time from my first request for a return number and today 10/01/01 is over three months and I still don't have a camera (frankly I'm not sure they are going to send one!).

If you do buy one of these cameras make sure that you are able to return it to the retailer for a refund.  Don't wait like I did for the retailers return guarantee to expire and then get stuck dealing with Mustek.

Like the man once said "You get what you pay for".
