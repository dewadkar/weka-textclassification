            I don't actually own a Saturn, yet.  But it will be my next new car.  I help a friend shop for his and it was a great experience.  Nice, helpful, un-pushy sales people and good service.

But the best part of the car was getting a flat tire.  Not what most people think of as uplifting, and this started as no exception.  First, it was within the first 2 hours of our vacation.  The back of the station wagon was packed with coolers and camping gear.  And it was raining.  Just perfect......  Almost enough to make you give up and go back home.

I figured that we would lost at least an hour on the little exercise, if not more.  I was going to be wet, cold, tired and late!

The first pleasant surprise was the location on the spare tire. It is well to the back of the cargo space, so we could get the tire &amp; jack out without having to completely unload the car.  It was one of those mini-spares, but I had expected that.  Another nice surprise was that there were instructions printed in nice size letters on the spare tire well cover.  Now I can change a tire without instructions, but it was nice to be able to clearly see the proper jack locations.

The jack was very easy to use and the tire iron was one of the best I have ever used.  The socket was long enough to get a good grip on the nut, and the hinged design made it easy to apply a lot of force without risking your knuckles.

Instead of a miserable hour, the whole process only took 15 minutes, including the partial unloading and reloading of the car.

Clearly, someone actually thought about the process of changing a tire and made the engineering changes needed to ease the process.  It was time and energy well spent, and shows what just minor changes can do.

When you are considering a new car, give Saturn a long look.  I think you will like what you see.<br><br>
