            I recently had the opportunity to put a loaded, silver 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe through the wringer. The car had every option available for the automanual (the various manufacturers have so many different names for these things now that I think "automanual" will be the term I use going forward), including the aerodynamics package, 18 inch rims, navigation system, heated seats, etc. I had been wanting to drive one of these since they were released but didn't want to have to plunk down a $500 deposit to do so (what BS THAT was). Anyways, now test drives do not require a signature so I wanted to test one of these out before I purchased my next car to see if the hype (Car of the Year) was justified and whether or not I could make a coupe work. 

Exterior: 

I think the G35 Coupe is one of the most unique and artful exterior designs I've seen on a coupe in some time, however, it is definitely in the Japanese idiom. You would never see something this outlandish come out of Bavaria, at least, I never would have believed so until seeing every new BMW that's been released since Bangle decided to destroy the marque's image. So perhaps the G35 isn't so radical. I must interject that I am not a fan of the G35 sedan at all. It looks too long and skinny, the wheel wells need 19 inch rims to look satisfactory, and the head and tail lights seem out of place. Somehow though, the coupe works. The coupe is also a long vehicle, but it's a much more muscular looking design despite being only an inch wider and shorter than the sedan. The coupe also gets more aggressive fender flares and the head and tail lights somehow seem to fit the design perfectly (Nissan Maxima designers please take note). With the 18s and the aero package, the car turns heads wherever it goes, mine included. I still prefer the looks of the 3 series coupe (the 2004 body style is, in my opinion, the best looking coupe I've seen to date), but I give the G's exterior looks a 9 out of 10. 

Interior: 

While the exterior of the G is a no compromise design that shouts, "look at me!", the interior is where Infiniti's engineers chose to cut costs. Compared with the exterior, the interior design is bland. It's a high tech theme, with fake brushed aluminum accents and decent quality leather surfaces surrounding a very straight forward, rectangular center stack. Together, the center stack and dash seem to form a very simple, angular "T" shape, and the the 3 spoke steering wheel is shaped similarly. The design theme is consistent, however, it is not very interesting to look at. Hard plastic abounds throughout. The "brushed aluminum" accents look like they were pulled off my Canon camcorder (or a Nissan Maxima for that matter). While the switchgear and buttons fit the design theme and operate nicely, nothing in this car's interior comes close to Audi or even Acura quality. In addition, I found the location of the seat adjustments puzzling. They are located on the inside of each seat near (at times, directly under) where your thigh rests on the seat. I can't help but think this is not the safest set up, and you still have to reach down to the outside to adjust the angle of the seat back. Bad design. On the flip side, the seats themselves are very comfortable, with plenty of side bolstering and a small hump positioned between the driver's legs on the seat bottom to help prevent you from sliding around during hard cornering. I loved the seats in this car and I expect they would be comfortable even on long trips. The long wheel base of this car affords both front and rear passengers with enough leg room to be comfortable, although fully grown adults wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the back seat. The sloping rear window really cuts into headroom and anyone over 5'8 is going to have to adjust the coif after even a short ride. The trunk in the coupe is downright tiny, and probably only a cubic foot away from being useless. Yes, sporting coupes typically don't have big trunks, but the G35's is really small. The Infiniti DVD navigation system is tied with Acura for the most intuitive and user friendly set up on the market regardless of price range. And while the satellite equipped Bose radio is decent, it doesn't perform like you might expect for a car in this price range. Finally, the entire steering column, including the gauge cluster, tilts up and down. This is actually a nice feature as it prevents the gauges from being obscured by the steering wheel at different height adjustments. I am not a fan of Infiniti/Nissan's chosen instrumentation color - the orange just looks cheap and isn't particularly easy on the eyes at night. 

Now for my major quibble. The G35 is not a quiet car by any stretch of the imagination. Not that a sporting coupe should necessarily be quiet per se. The engine actually makes an aggressive snarl as the RPMs build and the exhaust note is pleasing for a medium displacement V6, particularly with the windows down. That is to be expected, and even desired. What is not expected is the incredible amount of wind noise that floods the cabin above 70 mph. It is literally no quieter than my Pathfinder at similar speeds and the car is as slippery as they come from a drag coefficient point of view (.28 drag coefficient with aero package). You'd think someone had strapped an invisible barn door to the grille when you reach freeway speeds. This to me is simply more evidence of cost (and perhaps, weight) cutting - thin glass, fewer and thinner door and window seals and sound insulation. It all adds up to a car that really lets you know when you have hit 80 mph. And despite its sporting nature, to me this is not a desirable trait in a $40,000 vehicle. 

On the Road: 

Impressions prior to getting behind the wheel were similar to my impressions of other Japanese cars - even the sports cars compromise on the side of practicality and suffer from cost constraints that allow continued price undercutting of the European competition. On the road the G35 went a long way towards changing my mind about the desirability of sporting Japanese vehicles. 

This is not just a quick car. This car is fast, even with the 5 speed automanual. Admittedly, the G35 doesn't have the big bore, tire spinning snort of a larger displacement (or forced induction) engine off the line, but once you hit 3,500 RPM in 1st gear hold on. Keep your foot all the way down and the V6 in this car positively flings you down the road with grin inducing urgency. The G doesn't sprint like a C32 or a current generation M3, but it is not far at all behind the 2004 S4 or the Jag S type R. In fact, I'd bet good money that the G would hang with both of those vehicles over a quarter mile and it costs at the least $15,000 less. The G's brakes are also excellent and haul it down from speed without noticeable dive or fade problems. I have heard that some owners are complaining about squeaky brakes and the demo I drove was no exception. I didn't think it was that big a deal at the time, but I can see that it could get annoying over the long haul. 

In addition to the wonderful V6, the automanual is the best Japanese unit I've used to date, executing snappy and smooth up and downshifts in the manual mode. In the fully automatic mode it doesn't search and downshifts readily when called upon. It is certainly not as lightning fast as the BMW SMG, but it is also much smoother and far better suited to daily driving. I would put it very close (but still behind) to the BMW Steptronic. 

The G35 benefits a great deal from its long wheelbase in the handling department. The ride is firm but not harsh and even with the 18s no booming or excessive vibration filtered into the cabin, even over questionable street surfaces. The car is almost BMW like in its ability to maintain a comfortable freeway ride but still be lightning quick on its feet. Yes, it is still a sports coupe, and no, it doesn't match the seemingly perfect balance between sport and comfort that a 3 series BMW does, but I would have no problem driving the G to the office every day (so long as I didn't have to carry anything in the trunk). Throwing the car around 270 degree on ramps and 90 degree intersections at speed reveals impressive balance that the car maintains thanks to its near perfect 51/49 weight distribution. Body roll is minimal regardless as to the speed you are traveling. At the traction limit, with the VDC on, the car understeers slightly. However, if you turn the VDC off, you can get the G35 to oversteer, violently if you so desire (or are not careful). Needless to say, if you are not an experienced driver do not go flying around turns with the RPMs up and the VDC off. One thing that did surprise me about the car's handling was its stability (or the lack thereof) at high speed. Taking a gradual freeway overpass at about 85 mph did not inspire the kind of confidence that I had in a 330Ci on the same stretch of pavement. While the car had the aero package (which is supposed to reduce any lift the car might generate at speed), it didn't feel as bolted to the road as its German competition. Perhaps my equilibrium was thrown off by the deafening wind noise. 

Summary: 

All told I have to give the G35 coupe two thumbs up. It's got all the tools to be a competent daily driver (just invest in some earplugs if you do alot of freeway commuting) and is downright fun when blasting away from stoplights and burning up the tires through the twisty stuff. It also looks great and you're sure to get tons of requests for test drives at the water cooler should you decide to plunk down the $40 large it will take to drive one home. While I prefer the 330Ci all around, it's hard to ignore the $10,000 difference in price for a similarly equipped BMW. If you are looking for a comfortable, high performance coupe that won't break the bank, the G35 should be at the top of your test drive list.
