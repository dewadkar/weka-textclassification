            I bought my Bravada last October. I got about 10k off the price, so I paid about $23,000, before tax and all. I owned a Jeep for the past 8 years, and wanted another SUV. A friend of mine bought an older Bravada last Spring and I liked it. When I went shopping for a new vehicle, I was actually looking at mini-vans. I had went to one of our Olds dealers and saw the 1999 Bravada's and fell in love with them. They couldn't give me a good enought deal, so I went to our biggest Olds dealer and found just what I was looking for, a grey one. I test drove it. It is loaded. Has everything but the sunroof. It is roomy. The leather seats are easy to keep clean. It drives like a cadillac, smooth and solid. It looks great. It's luxury at it's best. It is roomy for my whole family. The air conditioner is absolutely tops. I love driving the truck. We haven't taken it on a trip yet, so I can't compare it to the jeep. I feel anyone looking for a nice suv, who feels like they deserve luxury, should purchase a Bravada. By the way, this is my 4 Olds. Everyone in my family has owned Oldsmobiles over the years, I bet we have owned over 20 between all of us. Right now, both my sisters drive Oldsmobiles.<br><br>
