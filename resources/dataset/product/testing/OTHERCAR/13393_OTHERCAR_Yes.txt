                 I never thought that I would buy a mini-van, but even my husband loves the 2001 Chevy Venture Warner Brothers Edition (WBE).  It is not a cargo van, but I couldn't find a Venture passenger van link. It is the ultimate mini-van to drive.  My husband (6 feet tall) has plenty of leg room anywhere in the van and enough power for interstate driving. I wanted the van for two main reasons: 1) getting kids in and out quickly in the cold winter weather and 2) safety-especially traction in the winter.
  LOVE: The safety features, plenty of room, an entertainment system that includes a video player/overhead video screen and stereo that includes front and rear audio systems.
  HATE: The video player location is inconvenient for turning from the driver's seat to the back.  The rear window washer system has had some problems, leaking onto the inside of the rear window.
     We live in the northernmost area of New York state.  Our winters are long and bitterly cold.  Getting two small kids into a vehicle and buckled into their car seats can seem to take forever when the wind chill is below zero.  I did that several times last winter.  This winter I wanted to be able to get the kids out of their seats, bundled up and ready before the door was opened to the bitter cold.  There is plenty of room to move around and the automatic side door makes exiting a breeze.  This side door can also be activated by the keyless remote, so I can open it before we even get to the van.  No more standing in the cold unlocking and opening the door.
     The Warner Bros. Edition comes with optional Traction Control, which prevents the tires from spinning.  Working with the standard anti-lock brakes this gives you excellent control on slick roads.  Just last week I was able to get out of an icy parking lot while my friend's Dodge Durango was spinning the wheels.  This van also has the On-Star system standard.  This contacts emergency services in the event of a crash involving the airbags or at the touch of a button above the driver's seat.
     Although we weren't looking for a van with the trailering package, the one we purchased did include this.  The Venture (with the proper equipment) can tow up to 3,500 lbs.  The trailering package also includes touring suspension, automatic leveling control, an onboard air compressor and traction control.  Ours also included self-sealing tires.
     The Warner Brothers Entertainment System is fantastic.  It includes a video player and screen (behind the driver's seat, so you aren't distracted).  Also a stereo system that allows the front and rear passengers to listen to different music/videos at the same time.  A remote is included so the rear passengers can control their own system, rather than bothering the driver.
     The Warner Brothers Edition comes fully loaded, there aren't too many options available.  This makes it more expensive than the standard Venture.  Although the standard starts at around $24,000, the Warner Brothers Edition starts at $31,315.  But it is a great investment, especially for a family that make several long trips yearly.<br><br>
