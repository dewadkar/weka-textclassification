            My purchase of the 2000 Acura 3.2TL sedan didn't come easily.  I took my time and studied most of the cars in its class and then made my decision based on best price performance.  I have been rewarded time and again, because this is a car that always pleases me. 

For the base price, I didn't buy the navigation system, I got almost every option standard that one must pay for on other cars.  The 3.2 engine performance coupled with the very smooth running 5 speed automatic makes it a tiger in sheeps clothing.  You don't get the jerky feeling that you do when you press the accelerator to the floor in some cars.  The Acura 3.2 just moves out faster and faster.

As many buy a car for its personal appeal, the Acura sure has that.  I always get a second glance as I move through traffic and the interior is just as appealing.  No worries about taking a customer out in this car.

Based upon my 9 months in the Acura I can easily recommend it to others.  Yes, one has to fill it with high octane fuel, but that's the price of performance.  It sure makes up for that cost with excellent mileage as I'm getting 22 around town and got 30 on my recent highway trip.

Acura, yes they keep making them better and better, and with a price like this, who can complain. <br><br>
