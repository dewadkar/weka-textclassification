            My mom purchased a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire SE sedan new in 1996.  The main reason she choose this car over the others was the looks.  She drove by a Pontiac dealer, saw it on the lot and knew this would be her next car.

<b>Style: 8</b>

The Sunfire has a unique body style, which no other car on the road shares.  The back of the car has a fairly common bubbly trunk, but the front of the car has an original sporty look.  This makes the car great for someone who wants the look of a sports car, but can�t afford it.

<b>Speed and Acceleration: 7</b>

The SE model comes with a v4 engine with 115 horsepower.   The car accelerates fairly quickly, and will go plenty fast for the average driver.  This car definitely doesn�t have the power that a sports car has, but it�s good for the price.  

<b>Handling: 9</b>

This car handles very well.  You have to slow down a bit to take corners, but that�s not a big deal.  It also handles the snow nicely.  This is a big plus for us because we live in New England where we get a lot of snow.  The Sunfire has front wheel drive and ABS, both of which are extremely helpful on slick roads.

<b>Comfort: 9</b>

This is a very comfortable car.  I would take it on road trips without worry.  It takes bumps well and there is plenty of head and leg room in the front seat.  The back seat is also plenty comfy for two average sized people.  I wouldn�t recommend trying to fit three adults in the back seat though, that would get uncomfortable. 

My  only complaint regarding comfort would be that the backseat is really only designed for two people.   There is a hump in the middle seat so it�s not very comfy to sit on, plus you�re blocking the driver�s vision since you�re up so high.  This hump makes the other two seats more comfy because you sink in though.

<b>Gas Mileage: 8</b>

This car does fairly well on gas.  It has a 15.2 gallon tank and is said to get 24/36 mpg.  I�m not sure exactly what my mom�s Sunfire gets, but it�s about 25-30 mpg.  This is pretty good.
    
<b>Sound System: 6</b>

There�s nothing spectacular about the sound in this car.  I believe it comes standard with a tape deck, and you can get it with a CD player.  There is something wrong with the back speakers in my mom�s car where they will fade in and out.  This is somewhat annoying in the back seat, but you can�t really hear it in the front.  This probably would have been covered by the warrantee, but my mom doesn�t really care too much about stereo�s so it wasn�t a big deal to her.

<b>Safety: 8</b>

The Sunfire has both passenger and driver side air bags.   It also has Anti-Lock brakes.  The car is  small and lightweight though, so I�m not sure how well it would hold up in a serious accident.    
 
<b>Reliablitity: 10</b>

This is a very reliable car.  It has never broken down on us, or had to go to the shop.  I would feel safe driving this on long trips away from home.

<b>Noise: 6</b>

One thing I don�t like about this car is the noise.  It makes a lot of unexplainable noises that make me nervous.  This is probably only because I don�t know a lot about cars and I don�t know what noises are bad and what is okay.  I wish the engine was a bit quieter when it was idling or in park.  The plastic-like dash also squeaks a lot when going over bumps.
 
<b>Conclusion</b>

Overall this is a reliable and stylish car.  I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for an economy car.  However, if you can afford a car in a higher class I would of course go for the higher class.
