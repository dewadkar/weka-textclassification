            I ended my lease of a '97 SC2 and got a new 2000 SC2.  They have made several changes in the center controls for the radio and such.  There is a dial instead of a slide control for the temperature.  The engine has also been changed, I think beginning with this model, but I am not sure.  It runs quieter now (the noise is what everyone always noticed about my 97), the performance/normal switch beside the gearshift is also gone.  The car accelerates better now I think, it doesn't hold the gear as long and seems to have more get up and go.  It also holds corners better now too I think.  The 97 did a great job, but this one is even better!  :)  

The car is smarter too.  On the daytime running lights, if the car is in park, the lights go out.  If you have the keyless entry and leave your keys in the ignition and push the lock button on the power locks...the driver's door automatically unlocks!  If you set the parking brake and start to drive, after a few yards, there are some dings to let you know it's still set.  If the door(s) or trunk are open when you push the lock button on the remote, the horn honks 3 times to let you know something needs to be closed.  This came in very handy for me. I had accidentally pushed the trunk release button on the remote as I was walking away from the car. When I pushed the lock button, it honked at me, this made me turn around to see why that had happened. If it hadn't done that, I would have had the trunk popped while I was inside the store!  

The console armrest standard now and there is a cupholder in front of it that will hold regular 32 oz. or the kind that have the narrow bottom half. If there is a rounded bottom though, is does kind of wobble back and forth. There are also 2 additional cup holders in the back (on the nonsmoking version) that pull out from the back of the console where the ashtray was before.

I love this car and would definitely recommend it to anyone except tall people.  My salesman was at least 6'5&quot; and had to fold himself into the car everytime, which is kind of amusing to watch.  LOL  He said he'd never be able to have one himself due to his height.  But he must like selling them because he climbs in and out of them all day, and I've known him for 3 years now.  :)<br><br>
