            If you've never owned a Suburban, you don't know what your missing.  We purchased our '96 Suburban LT in '99 and it was best idea we've had yet.  I run a daycare and I can safely secure 6 small children, with ease, and my eldest son along with myself, no problem.  There isn't another vehicle on the road that has as much to offer as these big boys.  The leather interior, which is standard in the LT model, still looks new.  Considering all the children, carseats and grocery hauling I do, that's an exceptional piece of leather.  However, our last Surburban, which was a '92 didn't have leather and at 7 years old the interior still looked great.
If you flip down the 2nd row of seats, which go down with little effort, and take out the back row of seats, which comes out with ease, you can comfortably fit a 4'X 8' piece of lumber in the back and still shut the rear hatch or doors.  That's Roomy!!! 
For vacation trips, the Suburban is perfect!  You can comfortably seat 8 full size adults and there's plenty of room in the back for luggage.  There are also cup holders EVERYWHERE!  Chances are the only stops you'll have to make are for bathroom breaks or to get something to eat, this gas tank holds over 40 gallons of gas, that's a lot of driving before you need to get more gas!  The mileage is about what you'd expect or maybe a little better, we get about 17-20 interstate miles to the gallon, that's about the same as all sport utilities, now that's with NORMAL driving!    
The engine in our &quot;Bus&quot;(that's what we call it), which is the 5.7 liter &quot;VORTEC&quot; V-8 packs a lot of punch when you need to get going in a hurry.  I can't imagine anyone needing anymore power, but if you do, they go so far as to offer a 6.5 liter turbo diesel V-8.  If that can't haul it, pull it or drag it, it don't need to be moved!  All Surburban's have a standard automatic transmission, power steering, front A/C, and ABS, You can get about any option your heart desires, everything from rear A/C, CD player or changer, phone, TV/VCR combo, premium sound system(that rocks!), to a moon roof or sliding sun roof,  and &quot;power&quot; everything imaginable.  They don't come standard with the rear seats(3rd row), but I recommend you get them, it would be a waste not to.  This has to be the most practical family vehicle on the road, as it is much easier to handle and get in and out of than a van, especially if you get running boards!  I can't recommend this vehicle enough!  I grew up in a &quot;Suburban&quot; family and the tradition will live on!
The cost is very comparable to all other sport utilities, at about $20,000 to $30,000(if you get the K1500 or K2500 4WD) and you get so much more, why would anyone buy anything else?...It's beyond me.<br><br>
