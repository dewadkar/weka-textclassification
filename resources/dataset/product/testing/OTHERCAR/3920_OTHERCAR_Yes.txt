            I have owned a Toyota PU, a Ford PU, and now my second Chevy.

The first was a 1999 Silverado 1500LS SB w/5300 Vortec.  I liked this truck but wished it had 4 doors and wasnt crazy about the transmission.  Ride was good but could be improved based on the Ford and Rundra rides.  I drove that truck up until 8/01 and put 49500 miles on it before trading it in.

I test drove the equivalent Tundra and Fords.  Both stacked up well to the Silverado but lacked in different areas.  The Tundra is still to small and to get the equivalent of the 1500 4x4 Z71 was significantly more expensive then the Chevy.

I have only been driving my 2002 Z71 since 8/31/01 but even with the offroad package the cab noise lower then the '99, the ride is smoother, and I can feel the extra HP they got out of the 5300.

I honestly can say I dont have any cons yet!

Paid $200 over invoice ($27,800) going thru GMBuyPower WEB site.

I paid $24000 for my 1999 1500LS SB and got $16,800 REAL trade in allowance.
