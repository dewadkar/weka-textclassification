            I was fortunate to purchase one of the first newly designed Riv's in the summer of 1994. This model was reintroduced after being fully redesigned in 1994.

This vehicle offered every option that was on the market and then some. It's looks brought forth all kinds of inquiries as to what was this sleek looking vehicle. It did not stop at good looks, it's performance with a supercharged six  was superb. It road handling was one of the best. Being a 2 door , it was discontinued after the 1999 year. If you are fortunate enough to get hold of one, it will be a collector's prize. The  1995 Riv still offers a vehicle that will compete well with the current models on the market at this time. 

Grab one, store it in your garage, and will bring a pretty profit in the future. But if you want a 2000 year drive keep it on   the road<br><br>
