            These are the views of a British Prius fan.

I have been interested in the Prius since it appeared on a technology TV programme around 1997 (when it was launched in Japan).  I had long thought someone ought to make a car based along similar lines.

In the UK, the spec has been unchanged since the car was launched late 2000, except that an optional factory-fitted Sat-Nav system became available from March 2001 for US$3900 (this also includes a CD changer).  Cruise control, a feature requested in so many of the US reviews, is not available as an option, and I have heard of no one that will fit one as an accessory &#150 all the more annoying as it is standard equipment on Japanese models, and I understand only the control switch and different brake light switch are needed to make it work! (** see below for update)  Neither are side airbags or daytime lights available.  Over here, we get a 5-year (but only 60,000-mile) warranty on the Hybrid system.

A new Prius (without Sat-Nav) costs GBP #16,500 (about US$25,600).  It DOES include split/folding rear seats, along with a single CD player and cassette player.  I was debating whether to buy one, then spotted a dealer selling their 18-month-old demonstrator for #12,000 ($18,600).  It seemed to drive as well as a new one (looked as good too) so I figured I would risk it for a 25% saving, especially as it&#146s still too early to say what depreciation will be like longer term.  The car had done 19,000 miles when I bought it in April 2002, and I have since done 6,000 more (July 2002).  This has been trouble free, apart from the failure of the 12V battery, which the dealer replaced under warranty.

Many of the other reviews have explained how it works, so I will not repeat the description.  Like other reviewers, I love the smooth, quiet ride, brisk performance (I was surprised to see some reviewers thought the performance poor), and the comfortable, well-equipped cabin.  The foot operated parking brake is rare in the UK, and I found it hard to get used to.  On right hand drive, the gear selector only masks the audio display and air con buttons, and I find them by feel well enough.  It is hard to tell when the petrol (gas) engine cuts in, and my only (slight) complaint is the highish revs needed to maintain speed on a reasonably steep hill (just like my partner's Micra CVT).  Pressing the loud pedal hard does give it a good 'push' though, and I've never seen it run out of electric 'juice'.

I&#146m still fascinated by the displays, but find the fuel consumption readout a little untruthful!  When I fill the tank and work it out, generally consumption is about 3mpg worse than display (I reset the graph each time I fill up).  It&#146s still good (about 53 miles per UK gallon [=45 mpg on a US gallon] when the display will show about 56), but I expected more like 60.  Still, I have a daily 65 mile round trip to work and occasional business trips and at least once a month a 500 mile round trip to visit relatives, so it&#146s very welcome after the 40-42 mpg (UK gallons) my previous (smaller) car managed (a Toyota Yaris &#150 I don&#146t think they&#146re sold in the US &#150 it&#146s similar to a Nissan Micra/March).  Petrol (Gas) costs about US$5.25 per gallon for unleaded at the moment.

UPDATE OCT 2002: just over a month ago my dealer fitted the cruise control parts, and it's brilliant!  It cost US$250.  I have now added over 11,000 miles to the 19,000 the car had done when I bought it, and have no problems to report.
