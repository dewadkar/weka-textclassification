            I bought this truck cause I fell in love with the way it looked.  I was the envy of the neighborhood.  Now I know the old saying, don't judge a book by its cover.  The performance on the truck is very disappointing.
If you are looking for a truck just to haul a piece of furniture once in a while, or maybe going to the dump this would be it.  If you are looking to tow anything, well you bought the wrong truck.  This gas hog can't get out of its own way with an empty bed.

It's only 3 years old, has gone through a timing chain, power steering pump.  Oh can't forget the crank case seal, ball joints, tie rods, front shocks.  They have had to replace the front bumper from the paint peeling off.  They replaced the cab ceiling cause it was falling down.  I have replaced 2 light switches in the dashboard, and now have been told I will have to replace the whole lighting harness. The radio was replaced, the cigarette lighter twice, and all under 36,000 miles.

So if you want a truck that looks great in your driveway go for the Dakota, if you want performance go with their competition.
