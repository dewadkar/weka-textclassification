            ****************Update***************************
I totaled this car, and I must say that I am impressed with the way it held up.  I struck a vehicle while driving straight, they were turning left, pretty hard.  Both the airbags ejected and the seatbelt prevent me from exiting the vehicle through the windshield.
******************************************************
 
 When I went to look for a car, I asked myself what was most important to me. Sure I would like the ability to move furniture that a truck would offer, but how often do I really need that.  A convertible would be fun, but there are would come a time when I regret it. Same with a sports car. So I began my search for the perfect sedan.  This sedan would have to offer great pickup, while offering a comfortable setting.   I settled on a used 00' Maxima SE, fully loaded.
 
<b>Need for Speed</b>
I have been known to have a heavy foot.  So speed is important.  Most vital is 0-60 speed.  Acceleration could mean the difference b/t making a turn and missing it.  This car has the ability to do 0-60 in under 7 seconds.

<b>Bring on the Windy Roads</b>
I had a 96 edition of the Maxima GLE and liked it.  But the handling was not up to snuff.  I know and exceeded its limits, as I wrecked this car.  Things are different with the 00 Maxima SE.  Low profile tires and improved suspension offer better handling.

<b>Creature Comforts</b>
You won't confuse this car with a Mercedes or anything, but this car is pretty darn nice.  It has a sleek look including bucket seats, cool lighting, adjustable armrest, metal plated gear shift, automatic headlights, 8-way seats, homelink and much more depending on how many options you would like.  Pretty much everything that you need.  

Just a couple of notes: The adjustable armrests are kind of annoying to me.  They make the armrest raise to fit shorter arms, but the button is right where my arm rests, so it pops up every time that I am in the car.  Cup holders could be better. Brakes act strange when heated up (this may be unique to my car, does not cause brakes to fail).
