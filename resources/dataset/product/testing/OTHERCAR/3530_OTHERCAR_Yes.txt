            I have owned this camera for about 9 months.  I had the HP c200, but wanted more resolution.  When this camera came out at $300, I bought the first one I could find.

This camera is a huge improvement over the c200.  Not only does it have twice as many pixels, the LCD display is faster, and it has a USB interface.

Because the c200 only had a slow serial interface, I already had a compact flash reader for my computer, so I only used the USB interface once.  Because I don't use the camera to upload the images to my computer, my experience with battery life has been stellar.  I have taken almost 1100 pictures, almost all of them with the flash, on the original Energizer titanium batteries.  (A key to making the battery last longer is not to take pictures with the LCD screen.  This seems to really put a drain on the battery.)  Almost all of my pictures were taken through the viewfinder.  I use the LCD display to look at pictures I have already taken all the time.  After almost 1100 pictures, I'm starting to see signs that the batteries are almost depleted.  Based on these results, I can;t justify the inconvenience of using rechargable batteries with this camera.  Rechargables drain on their own over time, and you'd have to have two sets and switch between them all the time and remember to charge them.  For me, it is much easier to change the batteries once or twice a year.

I have taken pictures of fireworks, snow, clouds, kids, groups of people, weddings and more and have been very satisfied with the quality of the pictures.  I took some pictures at a cousin's wedding and wasn't allowed to use the flash.  I didn't have a tripod, so I kind of rested my elbows on the seat in front of me and held it as steady as I could.  I got some amazing pictures of the ceremony.  I turned the beep off and was taking pictures that were almost totally silent. Just a small click...no film advance.

I have uploaded pictures to photo printing services and gotten 4x6 prints that are virtually indistinguishable from normal pictures.  I have also gotten great-looking 5x7s.

The only thing I don't like about this camera is the delay between when you push the shutter and when the picture snaps.  The delay is caused by the camera focusing on the subject.  You can press the shutter half way to set the focus and then press it the rest of the way to snap the picture.  This works fine if you are doing a portrait, or something that isn't moving much, but for action shots, it makes it harder.
