            I had the 1997 Land Rover Discovery and drove it for about 2 years. During the time I had it one question always came up: &quot;I here they are unreliable, true?&quot;.
It is true that Land Rover built a reputation on rugged, repair anywhere, bushwhacking performance without creature comforts. However, some of the transition to modern SUV desirables had not gone smoothly.  Factors in build quality, reliability and internal company strife affected the US opinion of the Disco while the Range Rover seemed somewhat immune to most of these taunts.  The Range Rover will always be the Queen's 'truck'.
Itï¿½s true that the early (1995-96) Discovery's did have some problems.  The dealership I dealt with concurred with my opinion of the 1995 year models.  BMW took ownership of Land Rover and the effects were noticeable from the onset. I don't believe BMW is in the business to lose money.

My reason for buying the 1997 Discovery was to use the vehicle for camping, hunting, and occasional road trips.  I some of the controls a bit counter-intuitive but it was a short learning curve.  Many of the features of these vehicles reflect the off-road heritage on which they are built.  Long gas pedal travel, suspension setup, and drivetrain.  The truck did everything that I wanted it to do. I climbed hills that were difficult to walk up, never got stuck driving through muddy creek beds and pulled out stuck cars sitting on their frames.  The truck did everything I wanted it to do.  When the warranty was about to run out I figured it was time to let go so I checked out the new Discoveries.

Gone was the manual transfer case with locking differential. Hmmm... what else did LR add to 'help' me out?  Hill Descent Control, Active Suspension, Rear Leveling... everything to help the average driver.  The fact is that the majority of these vehicles never go off-road.  The interiors are more refined, the upholstery show better build, the engine is stronger for better traffic acceleration, and the suspension supports fast turns much much better.  Its a different truck... its a full blooded SUV mall attack platform now.  I am now in the market for an old 4WD truck not an SUV.

Overall the quality of Land Rover is improving with the influence of BMW.  BMWs X5 is in and above the class of the Infinity and Mercedes.  The Discovery not in this class. It occupies its own space and sometime comparisons are too generic. This is an SUV where the average buyer rarely approaches its true capabilities.  One key to happy ownership is in understanding that these are real off-road vehicles made to behave on the street.
