            I spent quite a bit of time combing over the lots of used trucks before I came across my Dodge.  The choices were slim and I needed to get a heavy duty truck since my trusty F-150 was getting pounded by my abuse.  

The truck had 50k miles on it and the salesman went to school with the prior owner and offered to get me in-touch with him to verify that the miles were mostly highway.  

The comfort and ride on the test drive was fantastic.  The truck has a nice list of features including power windows, locks, and steering,  A/C, cruise control, driving lamps, and 4wd.

Here is what I love: The tailgate height is perfect for me, loading and unloading is a pleasure.  The ride quality and comfort is fantastic.  I have driven the truck for or 12 hours straight at a time with out complaint.  I usually do about 30k miles a year and comfort is important to me.  The truck handles great with a full load.  Sometimes you forget just how much you have back there.  Power delivery of the 318 is nice and smooth.  It also has a decently bright bed light.  I really like to drive this truck.  After a hard day I do not mind being behind the wheel for the ride home.  Maybe I am just nuts, but I really feel more relaxed driving home at the end of the day in this truck.  The truck handles well and is very capable in slippery conditions.

Here is what I hate:  $$$$$ gas, parts, repairs.  I have spent almost $5k fixing this truck in the past three months.  I blew two transmissions.  For a heavy duty truck that is supposed to be capable of hauling and towing why would Dodge use such a fragile transmission?  This has become a real sore issue with me since I need the truck  for work.  Keep a spare $2,500 aside to replace a trashed transmission if you actually use this truck for more than transportation.  If you like to do your own maintenance, the truck can be especially painful (this is true of most all new vehicles though).  You could make replacing the distributor cap an Olympic  event.  A repair manual is a necessary item to perform some of the routine maintenance.  Parts have been more expensive than usual and many times available only at the dealer.  Fuel mileage is about what you would expect with this type of vehicle.  The truck does not seem to run as well on regular gas, so mid-grade is required.  I average about 13 miles to the gallon.  A heavy foot will really reduce that number.  I had both power door lock activators fail and the tagged me for $450 to replace them.  I recently had a manifold gasket leak and paid about $700 to have that fixed.  I have found that the dealership will really hit you hard to repair this vehicle.  Find a good mechanic in the area and avoid the dealer at all costs.  The mirrors have a good field of view but the mounts can become sloppy over time.  Getting the mirrors off the truck and disassembled is a fun puzzle for a weekend afternoon.  4wd is also somewhat tricky to engage sometimes but the truck moves very steady and Predictable in the snow and muck.

It has been a love hate relationship with this truck.  Would I buy another?  When the time comes, my first stop will be my local Ford dealer.
