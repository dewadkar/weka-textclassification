            Although I am primarily a photographer that still uses the traditional 35 MM camera, I finally decided to make the bold step and purchase a digital camera.  I decided to go with the Sony DSC-F707 because it has just about everything that a digital camera enthusiast could possible desire!

Some of the impressive features that immediately caught my attention were the 5.0 megapixel resolution and the long-life of the batteries.  When comparing the resolution of my DSC F707 digital camera pictures with some of my traditional 35 MM photographs, I honestly thought that the digital camera actually took crisper and sharper pictures.  As for the batteries, let's just say that I took this camera on a two-week cruise and I never had to change the batteries.

A few other users have also mentioned the autofocus capabilities of this camera are superb.  To be honest, I don't really have the need to take pictures that quickly so I have never really tested the quality of this feature.  All I know is that it always focuses very quickly and is always ready for me to take a picture.  I never have to spend any time waiting.

Another thing I love about this camera is its 5X optical zoom.  Most lower end digital cameras only offer 1X optical zoom or none at all.  I have found that this 5X optical zoom allows me to take extremely nice close ups with absolute clarity and depth.

One other feature that caught my attention was the nightshot and the nightframe features.  I have never thought that taking pictures in total darkness can be so much fun!  I love taking the camera on camping trips and testing out the camera around the campfire.  While other cameras will make the night pictures fuzzy and blurry, the DSC 707 pictures were as close to reality as I've ever seen.

The lens on this camera is also top-notch and warrants a mention.  It comes equipped with a Carl Zeiss lens that allows you to take excellent pictures in a wide variety of lighting conditions and environments.

Although I was impressed with all of the features that this camera has, I was a little puzzled that the camera only came with 16 MB of memory.  What were they thinking?  This amount of memory does not last very long when taking digital pictures in 5.0 megapixel resolution.  For an $800 camera, I would expect this camera to come with at least a 64 MB stick or more preferably a 128 MB stick.  Since memory for cameras is extremely inexpensive now, I view this shortfall as merely annoying rather than a major complaint.

All in all, this the DSC-707 is truly revolutionary in its design and features.  Although I will still keep my traditional 35 MM camera lying around, it is beginning to collect dust as I am now using the DSC-707 more and more.  I even purchased a top-notch copier to take advantage of the pictures I take with this camera.  The software that came with the camera was a breeze to set up and I was printing out beautiful pictures in no time flat.  I could not be happier.
