            I was looking for a nice quality digital camera that was in a mid range price. Since I have used Nikon's before (the CoolPix 900), I decided to look at the Nikon CoolPix 800. Once I read over the specs I found that it met all my needs and was in the price range that I wanted to pay. 

My experience has been that this camera is an outstanding product. I have been using it for just over a month, and really love it. All the pictures are of very high quality and have a nice clarity to them. I love the auto features of it 99% of the time it sets all the settings right for the picture I am taking. The only settings I have had to change is the auto flash which sometimes make the picture over exposed. 

I mainly use the camera for scenic pictures, and mostly sunsets. The camera performs way above and beyound my expectations.. The only thing I wish that would be different is the default 8 MB Compact Flash that is shipped with it. I think it should be a larger one, cause when you use the  camera in Manual mode and the highest quality picture, it will use the whole compact flash card for one picture (the picture is a 5 MB TIFF file).

Other than that I have no complaints at all. <br><br>
