            Nissan did it again. The 1996 Nissan Sentra is an okay car for the average Joe, but not for the average person. From the outside, one would think that the car was somewhat good to drive, but let me tell you... its so fun at all. 
Nissan built this car with the intention that it would be an all around good car. The basic downside of the car is that it is not well made. For one thing, the tires and suspension do not collaborate well with its overall body dimensions. Basically, the tires are too far in and also way to small for the size of the car. This can especially be felt when turning corners, since it sounds like the car is peeling out everytime. One would think that on a GXE model that Nissan would take more consideration on the handling of the car. The interior design of the car isn't as well thought out as the outside of the car either. The thing that really tickles my pickle is that when putting drinks in the cup holder, the drinks block the use of the radio... WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?! The space in the rear isn't much to talk about... especially when there isnt much space at all. 
This little car isn't that bad looking when seen from the front, but when seen from the back, WATCH OUT!! The back of the car looks like it fell of the ugly tree and hit every branch, then sprouted up again. MAN NISSAN.. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!! (I guess they weren't) 
The only thing that Nissan did right when building this car was to put a reasonable amount of horsepower in the engine as well as standard features of the car. The acceleration of the car is superb since it outruns Honda Civic LX models. Also, the car comes standard with a good 4 speaker cassette sound system, cruise control, power windows/locks, and more. 
All in all, this car is not one of Nissan's best. The car itself seems good, but when driven is a nightmare. This is a good economy car, but if your looking for something dependable and willing to pay a bit more, i suggest you do. <br><br>
