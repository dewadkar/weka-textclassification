            My husband purchased the Chevrolet Cavalier Z-24 in December of 1995 for me. I dearly loved this car but found out to soon not to ever buy the first year model of a car. You see this is the second time we have done this and we have encountered a lot of problems and recalls on the cars. This is a fast, good on gas car with a high insurance cost because we purchased the Z-24. Before we even got the car off the lot the low water light was on. Well they said we had a leak and fixed that. Then the check engine light kept coming on and it was a sensor. Before I drove the car 50 miles the check engine light was back on. This time another sensor. The low water light started again and soon found out it needed a water pump. I have replaced the starter and also had to buy a new battery. I still am having problems with the low water light. Not sure why. Even with all these problems I still love the car. It is a fun car to drive. I recommend the Cavalier. I know a lot of people who have them and have no problems. I would buy another as long as it is not a first model.<br><br>
