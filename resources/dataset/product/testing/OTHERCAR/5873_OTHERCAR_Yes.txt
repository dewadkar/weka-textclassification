             If you are looking for a used 2 door coupe this is a excellent choice.I owned a 1996 Beretta in the past. When I had traded it in I had 115,000 miles on it and never had to have anything repaired. The body was in perfect condition no rust,no chipped or faded paint. The only thing I ever took it to a mechanic shop for is normal scheduled maintenance. This car was great on gas and for being a small coupe it does seat five comfortable. The trunk space is medium. And even though I had the four cyl. it still had quick pickup when needed to get off to a fast start or if you need to change lanes in a hurry. When I traded my car in I wanted a brand new Beretta but  they don't make anymore. So when I went to look for a car I found A Chrysler Sebring LXI in which I absolutely love now.

 Honestly I'm not sure which one I like more I think they are both excellent cars.In price though the Beretta is less expensive.<br><br>
