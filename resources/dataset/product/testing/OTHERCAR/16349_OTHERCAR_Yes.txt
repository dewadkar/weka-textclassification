            This camera is by no means the best digital technology out there.  In fact, sometimes you may question it *but* if you combine this camera with an HP Photo Smart Printer and their Premium pictures, you will never know that you took the picture with a digital camera.

I print most of my pictures from this camera and people are always surprised that they were taken with a digital camera.  Now that HP's Premium paper comes in glossy it's even better.

This camera will hold 80 pictures with the normal chip.  We purchase a 48MB card which holds 490 pictures.  We've rarely used them all but it's nice to know you don't have to worry about changing the disk or trying to keep track of one.  The disks are very small.

It does take a long time to unload the camera onto the computer and the software provided certainly isn't top of the line but it works for printing the pictures and small edits.

We've been happy with it, the greatest thing about digital is all the "negatives" are now on CD-ROM.  I store a copy in my work desk drawer...  now if I only had time to scan all those old pictures :)
