              There was a long wait for this digital camera because Olympus kept changing the product release dates. So long infact that I was very tempted to give in and pay the extra money for the c-5050. After I finally got my hands on this camera I must say that I am really impressed with!
It is very ergonomic and light weight making its use very effortless. I shoot mostly action shots from sporting events and I am impressed with this camera's ability to nearly think ahead to prevent any abstract blurring. 
The supplied 16mb xd memory card is very small and very fast, however 16mb will only get you about 6-8 pictures at full resolution. You might want to go out and buy a 128 or 256 mb card if you plan on taking a good number of shots.

   
Battery Life: 

The battery life on this camera is really good concidering that you have an lcd screen that has to be on to access menu options and view your pictures to see how they turned out. With demanding use (lcd on, flash on, and the use of the zoom) I was able to get about 200 shots before having to recharge. 200 shots are more than enough shots for a sporting event, however, if you are on a one week vacation it isn't a bad idea to spend another $50 to buy an extra battery. There is nothing worse than being low on power when you need to take crucial, once-in-a-lifetime shots. When you are really low on battery power the cameras, like all cameras I have ever worked with, begins to lag. This lag is the difference between frontpage news and the "to be continued" sections that often feature text from the front page and articles that didn't have pictures good enough to be on the front page.

Picutre Quality:
 At 4 megapixels this digital camera has the capabilities to capture stunning photography. One thing to mention, however, is that there are other digital cameras that have higher resolutions if you don't mind forking over more cash. Another thing that is important is the quality of lense that a camera has and not just the resolution. Some cameras have high resolutions but have problems with noise, white balance, red eye, ect. This camera does great in all these areas. I took great action shots of the Raiders practicing in Napa from afar with this camera. The quality of the pictures was breath-takingly stunning. The players looked so life-like that it felt like you were in the huddle. I also capture a moment when the team was actually going after a fumble and the ball was laying on the grass away from the players. You could see each individual blade of grass very clearly and see the ripples and lettering on the ball! My only complaint about action shots is how long it takes to zoom in. It takes quite a while. You almost have to anticipate every move or shot to really come back with what you want. Over all I am impressed with the quality of pictures that this camera puts out. The resolutiion is good but the use of a high quality all glass lense really makes this thing stand out.

Night focus: 
Night time focus is fair on this camera. You won't find an assist light on this camera, however you could try using the AEL lock/memory button to point at a similar distance well lit object, lock, recompose, and then shoot. Maybe Olympus will address this issue with the release of future models. 

Zoom: 
This camera has one of the best zooms I have ever seen for a digital camera right out of the packaging. You get a seemless 10x optical zoom that will really help you get life-like shots from afar. I usually sit really close to the action when I go to football and or basketball games and with this camera I am sure I could get great shots from the "nose-bleed" section from way above. It also comes with a 3x digital zoom giving you a total of 30x zoom. Digital zooms, however, don't really count because they don't get actually get you closer to the action. What they do is enlarge the pixels of your photo from afar to the point that you can see it a little better but at the expense of picture quality (pixelation). The only complaint I had with the zoom is that it has an initial delay before activating. Which is caused mainly by the focus, which takes longer in motion and or night situations.  

Advanced features: 
The manual modes on this camera are excellent. You have instant access to apperture/shutter, speed/EV+-, and quick manual focus/focus lock for very controlled settings.
I really admire the cropping feature, which allows you to crop a picture to your liking and reduce unwanted space on your memory card. It is also nice to be able to record sound to your photos as they are being taken. The movie mode on this camera will keep going until your xd memory card runs out of space, unlike a lot of other cameras that only do a few seconds.

Add ons:
When I mention add-ons what I am really mentioning is the ability to add extra lenses for more life-like images. With this camera you will need to buy an adapter that mounts onto the thread outside of the lens to add on these extras, but it isn't that big of a deal. Here are some of the extras you can get for this.
- A 3 Piece Professional Filter Kit that includes a
UV filter to protect your valuable lens from dust, dirt, and scratches all while keeping out uv light of your photos.
It also includes a Polarizing Filter, which eliminates reflection and glare when shooting outdoors in sunlight.
Fianlly, an FD Filter, which eliminates the blue green color cast reflected from indoor lighting! It will neutralize skin tones and give you natural color when shooting indoors!

-An Ultra Wide Angle High Resolution 0.5X Lens
that is a professional Titanium Wide Angle Lens. 
It is primarily used to fit in the entire group when shooting an interior room scene with family and 
friends, or get more in the picture out-of-doors.

A final thought:  
I am very happy with the performance of this camera and the abilitiy to add on extra toys to help me get the kind of pictures people envy. I have had many digital cameras and various 35mm cameras as well. Out of all of the cameras I have had and or tested the c-750 has offered the most options for the money, has been extremely easy to use, and has put me closer to the action than the majority of other digital cameras that are out there. While this camera is mainly for intermediate to advanced users it has a lot of automatic features for the point and click beginners who just want a good picture but don't want the headache.
