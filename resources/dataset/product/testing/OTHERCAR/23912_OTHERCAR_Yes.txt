            I am not a car person.  The only function I see in a car is getting from Point A to Point B.  However, when I first saw the TT in a Neiman Marcus catalog, I knew I had to have it.  

I love the fact that I can park the TT anywhere.  I love that it is my favorite shade of blue.  I love that I actually miss my car when I travel.  The upgraded Bose system sounds amazing.

Things I don't like:  Getting a service appointment is near impossible.  The low, plastic apron gets scratched with the tiniest bump.  The cup holder is not placed in a very functional location.  I've had more than a few spills while trying to replace a cup.  Since I've never had such a low car, I found I hit my head while entering or exiting the car.  I've since gotten used to this, but new passengers have to be cautioned.  

I got the Quattro, which makes it fun to do fast turns.  I used to own a BMW 3 series, which was MUCH more powerful and felt sturdier.  But it was also very practical.  It's nice not having a practical car, it makes me feel reckless.

This is not a great car for someone with kids.  Nice if you are young, single and don't have lots of stuff or people to tote around.  If you have lots of money, this a great second car. <br><br>
