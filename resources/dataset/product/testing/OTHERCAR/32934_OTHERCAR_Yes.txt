            I bought this car with about 10,000 miles on it.  It had been a rental car in Omaha.  We've had a couple of Buick Regals in the past fifteen years and loved them.  I thought I'd try the Skylark.  

I absolutely love the ride.  I feel more connected to the car and road than I do in the Regal.  You sit a little lower in the Skylark and the seat is leaner (probably not as comfortable).  

The mileage has been consistently in the 27, 28, 29 mpg range.  Mechanically, I've had to replace the struts twice.  Once at about 60,000 miles and again at 90,000 miles.  This seems excessive to me.  I had one minor tweak to the transmission ($135 to replace a switch).

I had some brake problems at about 30,000 miles.  But have not had any other brake problems since they were repaired.

My son bought a 1993 Skylark this spring.  He also loves it.  At 6 ft 2 inches, he has plenty of leg room.  When I ride with him, I notice the passenger seat doesn't have quite the space that the driver has.  

Occasionally, I have guest in the back seat.  It helps if you have some short friends.  It is very tight for somebody over 5' 10&quot;.

I understand that Buick discontinued the Skylark for general sales in 1998.  I think they keep making a few for the car rental folks.  If I could find another car rental deal I would take advantage of it.
