            In 1996, I was in need of a new car. Working as a dental assistant and freelance writer at the time, I fit more in the financial category for a used car. Off to the car lot I went. Looking for something no more then, two years old and it had to be red. I know, but being a woman, color and style is very important. I also was very determined on making the purchase solely on my own merit. I wanted to do this one solo.

My first stop and only stop, was a Buick dealer five minutes from home. The first car my eyes caught was a bright red Buick Skylark. (Love at first sight.) I told the sales person that is the car I am going to buy. Against all odds I purchased that car. The only car I looked at that day. Has it been a mistake? Absolutely not! It was the best purchase I have ever made.

It is a 1994 Buick Skylark two door coupe. Sporty but luxury. In my eyes, this car has character and style. I have owned my skylark now for four years. I have had nothing but pure success. I have never had a problem, even with all the miles amd abuse I have put it through. It is a very comfortable and smooth ride, not to mention it is great on gas.

The Skylark has many great features: Anti-lock brakes, power windows, child safety locks, reclining seats, and much more. I can not say enough about the Buick Skylark. It is very affordable and for me has been very reliable. I highly recommend this car. I know some may not agree and that is ok. After all love is in the eye of the beholder.<br><br>
