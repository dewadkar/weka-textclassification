            I have owned this vehicle for almost 2 months, and it has been great!  We bought this vehicle for more room when travelling.  Another big factor was so that when we went somewhere with friends or family, we could all go together instead of driving separately.

Love: This vehicle is by far the most comfortable vehicle I have driven or rode in.  It is absolutely great!  It drives smooth.

Hate:  Filling up at a gas station.  (They have a big tank, so I do not have to visit the gas station often, but when I do it is almost $50.)

I think people with children would great benefit from owning this vehicle.  I also think is it great for people who like to go!  I know it has been great when 8 people can fit in one vehicle instead of taking 2 cars.<br><br>
