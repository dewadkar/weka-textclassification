            My husband and I have been dreaming for the date that we turn in our lease, which will be next month.  Knowing that time constraints were at hand, we researched and found the car that we wanted ahead of time to make our lives easier.  With several problems the making our lives easier portion of the last sentence didn't happen, however we do now have our new "purchased" vehicle and are absolutely loving it.

On our test drive for the vehicle, I knew this was the car.  Before purchasing the four door EX Civic we had a Mitsubishi Mirage Coupe.  Coupe meaning 2 door.  Try putting a 20 pound baby in a car seat that probably weighs about five pounds in and out of a two door car several times a day.  We knew this story would have a happier ending...  The test drive went well.  Our Mitsubishi shifts horrbily and the first thing about the Civic that we noticed is that we didn't jerk in our seatbelt at every automatic shift.  What a relief.  The suspension is wonderful in the front and back.  I believe only the EX models have a back suspension, but it is well worth the extra cash to upgrade to this model.

There is plenty of head room, leg room (in front and back), the trunk is huge.  There isn't a hump in the back seat, allowing three people to easily fit comfortably.  There is also a back cupholder for added convenience.  There isn't a smoking lighter in the front of the car, but instead a space for a cell phone charger or whatever contraption you feel you would like to add to your car. There are also two cupholders in front, with much storage space for toll receipts or whatever you find you place in your car frequently.

The car drives like a dream.  I feel like I am actually flying while driving this car. The first day I didn't want to get out. I think it may have been the new car smell getting to me.  But who doesn't love new car smell?

The car has so many other featuers:
dual anti-lock breaks, moon roof, keyless entry:
With the keyless entry.  The only thing I don't like about the car, which isn't a big deal is that you can't lock the car from the inside unless you are at the driver door.  I say this because when you are lugging a baby and are trying to put him and all of your bags into the car, it is convenient to lock the door from that position and close the door, having your keys already placed inside your comfy purse.  However, with this car I have to keep my keys out. Something I will just have to get used to.
Back to the features:
am/fm cd player, wonderful air conditioner, optional side airbags, regularly front driver and passenger air bags, dual suspension, child safety restraints, tether strap for added car seat safety (great feature to have).

There are other features, but I am sure I have covered enough here.  If you are seriously considering a Honda Civic and want to know more about it, feel free to email me.

Thanks for reading.
