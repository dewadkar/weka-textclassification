            The Grand Cherokee is the traveling person's dream vehicle.  This sport utility is roomy and cozy with a lot of options when wanting to make room for transporting products.  The front bucket seats are a lot more comfortable than the back bench seat but the kids don't seem to mind.  Your vision of the road and objects surrounding you is enhanced with this elevated vehicle yet it isn't too high for those days when a woman has to wear a skirt.  
The towing capability is outstanding.  While moving my former sister-in-law from California to Minnesota, we packed the trailer a little too full.  The Jeep kicked into automatic downshift and off we went at 75 mph across the United States.  The gas mileage is appropriate for a sport utility:  23 mpg in city, 34 mpg highway.
I bought this vehicle because I wanted to be able to haul stuff for my home and I needed the room for people.  The ride is smooth and the vision is outstanding.  This vehicle is built for a variety of people.<br><br>
