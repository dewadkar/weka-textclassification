            I'm a truck guy. I've sold them for a living, repaired them for a living and owned more than I can remember at one time or another. Not much about trucks impresses me... or didn't until now.

I've owned a Toyota Tundra, a new Ford, two new Chevy's, a Toyota Tacoma and 2 Dodge Dakotas in the past few years. Like I said... I'm a truck guy. But unless something unexpected and unpleasant hapens to this truck I don't plan to be trading it off anyime soon.

The small trucks were all too small on many occassions... especially the back seat, or lack of it. The Tacoma and the regular cab Dakota road like lumberwagons and the extended cab Dakota really didn't have a usable backseat in the true sense of the word. 

The Ford and the two Chevy's (a '97 and a 2000) were all reliability NIGHTMARES and spent as much time in the shop as they did in my garage much of the time. Each one was quickly traded off as soon as the warranty expired and I knew that I was going to have to start making two truck payments each month... one to the lender and the other to the service department!

The Tundra was reliable but I never could get used to the seating comfort (I'm a bigger than average guy) and frankly the looks never quite did it for me. The Tundra had gobs of power but a worse-than-useless backseat that sat so upright it was usable only by people who are already feeling lightheaded and NEED to sit with their head between their knees for extended periods of time.

The new Ram styling captured my attention right from the start, and the good reliability of my two Dakotas compared to the Ford and Chevy nightmares was promising.

After driving a quad-cab Ram 1500 SLT with leather I was smitten. I took it home and my wife and adult daughters all tried out the backseat and pronounced it suitable for up to 6 REAL passengers... maybe not cross-country but certainly for a 2-3 hour trip in comfort.

So far I have had zero problems with the vehicle... typical of my Dakotas as well. (Between the three of them, they've only ever seen the dealership one time and that for a simple seat-latch adjustment that took 5 minutes.) The more we drive this truck the more impressed we are with the comfort and ride quality, convenience and of course the styling!

It wouldn't be fair to say that the gas mileage has been disappointing because I didn't have much in the way of expectations so I haven't been disappointed. The 5.9L engine has been around forever and what it gives up in economy it makes up for with proven reliability and good power. Overall, 75% city, 25% highway driving I'm averagine in the 13's but it has moments of doing 16+ on the highway.

The new 5.7L Hemi may eventually prove to be a better engine for Dodge, but reliability remains unproven and the engine will only be available in the 2500/3500 line initially for 2003. 

The rear doors swing wide on the new Ram and rear seat comfort while not quite the equivalent of the front seats is very, very good with by far the most acceptable seatback angle of the big 3. For and Chevy both sit more upright and the Tundra pushes you forward at the waist. 

Storage in the truck is ABUNDANT with the huge console, the underseat storage for the front middle seat and all 3 rear seats, and the convenient flip-up seats in back with the flop-down cargo platform which converts in 2 seconds flat.

I drove two trucks with the new 20" wheels and tires but found the ride to be a bit harsh and busy and chose the 17" combination instead. The 20" styling just wasn't worth the discomfort.

The truck gets LOTS of comments for styling and even more comments from those who are lucky enough to get to ride in it. Try one. You'll be impressed too.
