            My Corolla LE is the best money I've ever spent.  The nice, quiet, smooth ride is unmatched in any other car its size.  I drove all of the competition prior to buying e.g. Civic, Sentra, etc. and they didn't come close.  Toyota reliability is another plus, I still have my 1991 Camry with 197,000 trouble free miles and I know my new Corolla will provide the same service.  The stereo with CD sounds BIG.  The overall quality, especially the interior looks very expensive.  I love the impulse red color with the beige interior. I also opted for the spoiler, woodgrain dash, mudguards, gold package, keyless entry, all weather package, and electric moonroof.  This is definitely a big car in a small package.
