            This is our second 2500 series Suburban.  Both loaded with equipment.  Both were  intended to tow a heavy boat and travel trailer and for lots of people.

Our first was a 1993 that went for 134,000 miles, largely trouble free.  It was  a very comfortable and useful vehicle.  Many long trips and  we used it around town as our second  vehicle.

We thought about the Excursion, but it was simply too big and I do not like diesels for a family vehicle.  We also thought about going back to a crew cab dually, talk about big and  cumbersome not this time around.

Our newest is a  2003 model 4 wheel drive,  purchased in March 2003, we  have 12,000 miles  on it.  the 2003 model  is  a significant improvement over an already good vehicle. We were  surprised.  It  had  been  10  years  since  we purchased our 1993 Suburban, but still the improvements were dramatic.

Color selections are limited in the 2500 series with the 8.1 liter 4.10 axle.  I believe it is about 5-6.  We used  the internet to locate a dealer in the area that potentially had the model we wanted and made a few calls  before visiting two dealers.  The list price  is  not for the faint of heart or budget.  When it was  all said and  done with a couple of dealer installed options, it was right at $55,000 sticker.  All  of the discounts wittled it down, but it was still  expensive.  We did not trade in our 1993 Suburban,  we  sold  that ourselves for $7,300.

We live in Denver and our boat  weighs over 10,000lbs.  Technically a  normally aspirated engine  loses 3% horsepower per 1,000 foot of elevation gain.  We are at 5,000 feet and go over passes that exceed 11,000 feet, we need the power and  this vehicle has it.  We can tow with the air conditioning  on.  The vehicle is rated for 12,000 lbs.  The brakes are now 4 wheel disks and they work very well.

Our fishing club is located at the end of a very rough road.  Its  steep and  rocky.  This  vehicle handles it well with not a  lot of frame twist.  On the way down the transmission holds the vehicle back well, making it easier to get down.  

Its has a lot of electronics and that has  concerned me.  Getting the automatic  adjustments right for the mirrors, seats etc took a  lot of reading, double checking and reading some more in the owners manual.  They have lost their settings a couple of times in 12,000 miles but as we  have gotten used to the vehicle, it seems more reliable in that regard.  We have experience with electronics  in cars because of our BMW's.  I am not sure that this has not gone too far.  On the Suburban we  do not  use business mileage and personal mileage, hours of operation etc.  features.  

The  automatic oil mileage meter did not make sense  to me, when I have driven the car for 3,000 miles it will read I still have 60 percent left on the oil change.  I have had good  success with my engines by changing the oil at 3,000 to 5,000 mile intervals and I don't intend to change now.

We have taken a 3,500 mile trip with it this summer and it was smooth and quiet.  The air conditioning work as expected.  We did not tow a trailer on this trip.  We also took a 2,000  mile trip with it and  again flawless.  We generally have 4 adults  in the  Suburban when we  travel.

We went with the lift gate back door.  We originally wanted  the  ambulance doors like the 1993 but that was not in town, and after measuring things we knew the  lift gate would work with our trailer.  We are happy that we went with the lift gate, its easier to  picnick around the rear of the vehicle without having to go around those doors.

The radio is simple but no tape player and  we do not like that for  we have lots of Louis Lamour tapes that we  like to listen to on trips.

We have leather seats  and  that is okay.  The rear seats come out easily.  Its a  little lower  than  the 1993 Suburban.  I rebuilt the beverage holder in the consol in order to hold a  tissue box,  now its just right.

It has plenty of power ports that  we need that for telephones, computer and tape player on trips.

The rear seat now has headphone  jacks we don't use that.

The headlights are automatic and  that is okay.  

We  now have 12,000 miles on the vehicle.  The engine has finally loosened up.  It gets around 12 mpg around town.  A  13-14 mpg on the highway  at maximum highway speeds,  not towing.  Towing our boat it gets 9 mpg going over the  mountains  to Lake Powell, this  really is a  load, we do not run it at maximum speeds on this trip, we take it somewhat easy.  It burns about 1 quart of oil every 2,000  miles, this is more than our old vehicle which had  the 7.4  engine. We have  not had  any repair issues.

This vehicle is much more responsive then the 1993 Suburban.  It accelerates with ease, in some respects its a hot rod.  Its brakes are excellent and stops the vehicle like a car.
