            This vehicle was purchased eight months ago at the time of my writing this. We purchased it to replace a 15 year old car that just wasn't economical anymore. After test driving the 1990 4 door Calais, I was very pleased because of the power output of the Quad 4 engine. And it still managed to get around 30mpg. At the time of purchase, it had 119k mi and I brought home from a dealer for $2700. Just about a month ago (130k mi)the automatic transmission started to slip. $1300 later the car was fixed. Only a week after I got it back, all of the sudden the &quot;low coolant&quot; light went on, I pulled over immediately to find coolant gushing out from underneath. Turns out it was the heater core, it was kind of nice that when the heater core went it has a hose that drains the coolant out the firewall to the ground, rather than into the passenger compartment. Anyway... I just rigged up the coolant lines to bypass the heater core for now, the repair is about $300(it's summer, I'll deal with it later). Now just a week ago the car suddenly lost power. It would miss at idle and die when put in gear unless you revved it. I took it in to the shop where they told me it was a shorted fuel injector. I decided to bite the bullet and have the repair done. It came to $330 (that includes cleaning the remaining injectors to match the performance of the new one. I still like the car's overall performance and economy, but it just hasn't held up well. <br><br>
