            Pregnant with our third child, I was depressed at the thought of driving a minivan. But with our other two kids still in car seats, we definitely needed something bigger than our Honda Civic. So we visited our local minivan dealers -- again and again and again. The minivans were okay, but they seemed so suburban, so white bread. We just couldn't make the commitment. Then a friend suggested a Volvo wagon. At first, I immediately dismissed the idea. &quot;You've got to be kidding. It's a station wagon. That's what my mom drove to take my friends and me to the Peter Frampton concert in 1977.&quot; But the more he talked them up, the closer I listened. So I got on the Internet to research these cars and discovered some impressive safety statistics, and I was sold. 

Of course, Volvos aren't inexpensive. But as I once heard Click &amp; Clack say, &quot;It's better to be in the poorhouse than in the cemetery.&quot; We got a great lease deal that makes the car very affordable for us. And we now have more than enough room for everyone. The baby's car seat goes in the middle of the back seat, and the other two sit on either side in the built-in child booster seats. These are wonderful. The girls can buckle themselves in, and the seats fold up if an older person wants to sit there. We also got the optional rear-facing third seat, which our kids can use once they reach 50 pounds, thus giving us room to seat seven. Then someday I too will be able to ferry a bunch of giggling girls to their first concert.<br><br>
