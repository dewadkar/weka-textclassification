            I've had my S200 for a week now and have been thrilled with it.  It takes great photos, is so small that I can carry it with me everywhere and it is pretty simple to use, yet you can make it a little more complexe and have some manual control.

The tiny battery holds out for a fair amount of time, longer than I expected.  However, since it does use a special battery, I went ahead and purchased 2 more aftermarket batteries off eBay, so I should be able to take tons of flash photos and not ever worry about running out of power.

Speaking of flash photos, the flash is pretty powerful, I've taken some shots inside my house and it really lights up everything, even over 25 feet away.  However, when at the lens is at the widest setting, the corners will be a little dark, not blacked out or anything, but you will notice it a little.

When I purchased the camera, I got a 128meg card as well, and at the lowest setting you can get WELL OVER 1000 photos!  And lowest setting is really pretty good truth be told.  My main use if for my web site, so a 1024 X 768 photo would be a bit to big.  The lowest setting is also good for when you list eBay items and such.

Being able to hook the camera right up to a TV set is really nice, you can even set it up to do a slide show automatcially.  The images look great on a TV, so now you have a super easy way to bore your friends and family to death when you show them the vacation photos from the cheese factory tour (at least the quality of the photos will be good).

The video recording is a nice touch, but I wouldn't really expect to make a movie using with it.  At the best res, you can only record like 5 seconds, and at the lowest res, about 25-ish seconds.  While I don't expect to use it often, I'm sure it will come in handy at some point. 

The software that comes with the camera is fairly nice.  It didn't take over my computer and enslave me to do it's bidding.  It has a few "eye candy" features, like the "Time Tunnel" and and it is pretty easy to locate X photo, even if you have a lot of photos to dig though.  Normally I don't keep the OE software on stuff like this, but this one I will keep around since it is easy to use and fits my needs.

In closing, if you are looking for a great camera for under $300, then you can't go wrong.  I paid $250 for the camera, $39 for the 128M card and no shipping cost at bestpriceaudiovideo.com and was pleased with the service.  I got the 2 extra batteries from eBay user "power101com" for $24 a pop (with shipping).  I'm still working on the first charge of the first battery, and so far I have taken a ton of worthless photos trying to wear the battery out.
