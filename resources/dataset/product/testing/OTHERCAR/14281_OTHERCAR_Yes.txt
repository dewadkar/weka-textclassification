            Well, these cars are absolutly amazing.  The new 2000 models are great!  We just traded our 1998 Suburban in for the new 2000ls. I must say, I am so happy!  The looks are amazing, and the car is great!

Well, as for the car....I have been driving it for the past week.  Since getting it, I rear ended a 1999 suburban in the middle of gay town. Was that ever a mistake!  I upset a drama queen in the middle of traffic.  But, since both cars are troopers, neither was hurt.  Thank you Chevy!!! Well, anyhow.  It looks amazing. The inside and outside are great. The brakes are good (I used them a lot...it was my fault..not the car).  And, it is fast!  I drove home and raced a Honda Accord.  I must say, I kept up.  Never rolled it.  Came close only once, but no car would have done better.  Maybe a lotus...but anyhow.   It held up great!  The driver of the Accord was impressed too!  I mean, the huge urban assault vehicle handles better than my Jeep Cherokee, is faster, and better looking.  I love that car!  Everyone should buy one.  <br><br>
