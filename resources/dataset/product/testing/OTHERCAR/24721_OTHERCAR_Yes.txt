            I am (was) a Cannon SLR Camera user.  I bought this Sony Camera for my real estate to go along with this new wireless modem I just bought to get onto the internet at 128kbps from anywhere including the properties I am selling to be able to send the pictures directly to the Realtor Multiple Listing Service by uploading them unto my wireless laptop connected to the internet and then send them via e-mail to the MLS.  
I decided to take my new Sony Camera on my vacation up to Seattle and Victoria, Canada to get the feel of it, since I would have extra time on my hands.  
I had NO IDEA the quality of the pictures would be so GREAT!!  
I was at Butchart Gardens up in Victoria and took a picture of a butterfly sitting on a yellow flower. The quality is Professional quality.  I just printed it out and am amazed at the depth and clarity.  I had it set on &quot;Macro&quot; when I took the picture. I ended up using this camera for my whole vacation!!  
One of the things I really like about it is the ease of use.  The instructions are very clear.  I also bought a 64 mb memory stick to hold more pictures.  I found that I still had room after 40 pictures.  
I bought mine from the Good Guys and also got the warranty for $120.
I also like the fact that it comes with Lithium Ion Batteries. Another camera I was considering had only AA batteries. I would have had to buy the Lithium Ion Batteries and the recharger.
