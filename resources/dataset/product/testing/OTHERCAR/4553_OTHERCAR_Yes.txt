            I recently researched numerous digital cameras and finally decided on the Olympus C 2040 Zoom. It has a super bright optical zoom lens for optimal use in low light situations, as well as a 2.11 megapixel resolution. It also has a quick-time movie mode and edit function. It can use AA batteries as well as the LB-01 (CR-3V) long life lithium batteries. I purchased mine online and had a quick and easy experience. I got the camera, plus 5 accessories, for the price that the camera alone would normally cost. Based on comparable cameras, it is a good value for the money. However, it is not for the novice photographer. The features available on the camera are best utilized by someone who understands their function. If you want a basic digital camera that you intend to keep in "automatic" mode, this is not the camera for you. For the avid photographer who wants to experiment with all the things manual photography has to offer, this is an excellent value and comparable to other highly rated camera's with similar features. One other benefit to this camera is that is looks and feel great.. and it's very lightweight. 

If you decide to order this camera and have problems downloading your images, it is likely that the directions enclosed were the wrong version. Call the technology number listed in the manual or go to the website. You will find a quick and easy answer to your problem.
