                 Oh, the everlasting searches for vehicles, what price range?  What color?  What style?  The list goes on.  My search for the &quot;perfect&quot; vehicle for me came to an end when I saw an advertisement for a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am, it had four doors, the color was nice, and it had low mileage for a used car in my opinion.

     I searched over the internet at Edmunds.com and some other sites, looking for a car.  I had owned two cars before, a Subaru, which I had for four years, loved the car, hated the problems.  The second car I had was a 1993 Eagle Talon, despised the car, hated the problems.  That car was a &quot;Bad Deal&quot; from the start.  Two clutches replaced in one year, transmission replacement, belts, hoses, windshield, etc. You name it, my money was spent on it.

     I had to do something quick, the pick up was gone, and I knew my car was about to die, so I went to the dealership, and the dealership gave me $2000.00 for my car (It was a holiday), which was worth about $750.00.  I took the Pontiac for a spin, tried not to fall in love with it, but then I obtained my own financing, my own insurance, and proudly became the owner.

     Since February, I have been to the dealership a couple of times.  
One thing to be aware of with the 1999 Grand Ams, if you notice your back windows scratched up, it is because the manufacturer put in windows that are too big.  Luckily, mine were replaced for free, under warranty, and I haven't had to put that much money into this car yet, other than gas, because it is a gas burner.  

     I love this car for many reasons, the sunroof, the CD changer, the large vents for air conditioning, heat, etc., the comfy seats,leg room, the lever on the side that lifts me up &amp; down, and most of all the keyless entry, power windows, locks, gadgets, security features, and large trunk.

     This car has spoiled me compared to the other cars I have had.  My piece of junk Talon?  Oh, it died three days after sitting on the dealer's lot, so I believe everything does happen for a reason.  I was lucky that it all went so smoothly, my car payments are lower than the Talon, (it's financed a little longer), the insurance is lower, and I feel like I'm in heaven comfortably!  Test drive it, and you may not look back!<br><br>
