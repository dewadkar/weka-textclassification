            After researching digital cameras for several months I thought I had made my decision until I found the Olympus 450 Zoom Digital Camera.  Some of the great features include:
-lightweight/compact
-convenient carrying case
-includes Camedia floppydisk adaptor
-easy to zoom in and out
-excellent quality pictures taken in any type of lighting
-fast and easy downloading of pictures
-easy to edit pictures once downloaded onto computer
-good size LCD screen
-can lock pictures so they cannot be accidentally erased
-includes tv/vcr adaptor so you can watch a slide show on your television
-compatible with Lexmar Digital Film which is a lot cheaper than the        
  Olympus brand.
-can get at least 122 pictures with the 8MB digital film using the low
  resolution setting and still get great photos

I have thoroughly enjoyed using the Olympus 450-Zoom camera.  Just last night I was getting ready to have dinner with friends and was so busy during the day that I didn't get a chance to download and print pictures but thanks to the LCD screen I was able to take the camera along and show them an instant slide show of my children.

The camera is small enough to slip into a purse or diaper bag.  Even a shirt pocket!

Unfortunately, I have found that the camera is a lot cheaper now than when I bought mine in June '99!<br><br>
