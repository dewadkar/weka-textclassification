            You'd think, looking in our driveway, that we own stock in Nissan, or that we are paid spokespersons for them.  We are on our third brand new Nissan (That's two Maximas and one Xterra) in eight blissful years of marriage.

This review will not be technical.  The reason is simple; it's easy to get these quotes from the website.  What I can tell you is my very personal experience with this car.  While these cars are certainly worth the money we paid, I think that Nissan is cutting corners to bring to the market a more powerful car for the same money.  And while I love the extra horsepower, I do miss some of the Maxima perks which I must admit I never missed until they were gone.   Our Maxima is the GLE model.

<b>Body Style:</b>

I  had to get used to the look of this Maxima.  It is sleek, but seems a little boxy and odd looking.  The back looks a little unusual, but it has since grown on me.  The paint is beautiful, as we chose a Sea mist color which was a factory color, and I get lots of stares.  I will take this as a good thing!

Another completely jazzy feature about this car is the headlights!  They are halogen and have the most beautiful and impressive glow about them.  They are quite different from the standard version and an upgrade that makes this car sweet!

<b>The Trunk:</b>

The trunk gets kudos for being one of the largest on a four-door vehicle that I&#146ve seen.  Ours also came with a little net strung up about halfway through to that I can keep my stroller tucked back in the very back of the trunk without if rolling all around while we drive.  It also leaves plenty of space for my groceries.  The trunk can be opened three ways:  First, the old-fashioned way, with your key.  Secondly, you can use your key ring (which can scare folks when you do this from far away in the Wal-Mart parking lot!) and you can also use the trunk release on the driver&#146s side door.  One change from my 1996 model is that now you must pull the button out instead of pushing it in to pop the trunk.  This safety feature is to prevent your trunk from opening by mistake if you happen to accidentally push the button while driving.  My one complaint is that the hinges are so large on this model that if you put anything near them, the trunk will not shut.

<b>The Interior: </b>
 
Oh, this is what hooked me!  The interior is just beautiful.  The leather seats are comfortable and plush.  The inside door handles and the drive shift is a polished platinum color that makes us look far more wealthy than we are.  The legroom afforded by this oversized Sudan is stunning. Honestly, this car can accommodate three normal sized people pretty comfortably.  

You may also move the front seats in more directions.  I&#146m a tall woman with long legs, so I like for the seat to be further back, but a little taller.  My husband, while taller than me, has shorter legs and a longer torso, so the opposite is required for him.  We have two automatic seat savers, which remembers which setting each of us likes.  

The windows on this Sudan are somewhat annoying.  In the back, there is always a sound like the seal is not tight and it is noisy.  Upon contacting Nissan, we were told that there was a defect with these windows and they would be fixed.  I will update if and when that happens.

Another complaint on the windows for you folks with small children.  My front windows automatically roll up with only one pull of the lever.  Now, if your kids fingers are in the window, it will not stop.  And it is so quick, you may just want it to go up a little bit, but it is up before you know it.  I consider this a danger, although you should never leave a child alone in the car, we all know how precocious children can be and we need every safety device we can get.  

<b>The Options: </b>

We have the optional GPS Navigational System.  While not as fancy or as thorough as the North Star System, this little gem has gotten me out of more than one sticky situation.  I have found, however, that it does not recognize smaller roads, but that is fine since we normally use it on long trips and not around town.  The only thing that bothers me about this is that it doesn&#146t automatically come one when you turn the car on.  You must manually turn it on or you are looking at a blank screen.

I suppose cruise control is technically an option, but I can&#146t imagine a new car these days not coming with it.  This cruise control is conveniently located on the steering wheel, which makes it simple to turn on and manipulate while driving.  This is a definite improvement over the &#14696 model, whose on switch was located on the dashboard.  You had to take your eyes off of the road to turn it on, which is a hazard.

<b>The Stereo</b>

Now this is an important feature to me.  Ours has a Bose sound system inside that is of superior sound.  Another upgrade from the &#14696 model is the CD player.  The  2002 model has a 6-CD Changer.  This is so much better for me that fooling with the one CD fed from the front.  I can&#146t tell you how many times I&#146ve run off the road looking for a CD in my case and then trying to insert it without killing myself or scratching my CD.  

To that end, there are also stereo controls on the steering wheel so you never have to remove your hands for volume control, changing radio stations, or controlling your CD player.

<b>The Ride: </b>

While this car is more powerful than the 1996 model, it isn&#146t quite as smooth of a ride.  The shocks on our model are simply terrible.  Now, maybe that is an easy thing to fix, but my car is brand new, so I don&#146t feel they ought to be worn out just yet!  We feel and hear every single bump in the rode.

Perhaps my biggest gripe about this car is its turning range.  This car does not turn on a dime like its predecessors.  In fact, I have trouble getting this baby into our two-car garage when we have another car inside.  It is especially troublesome if you are trying to make a U-turn in front of cars and you have to turn it into a 3-point turn unexpectedly.  I suppose it could be that the chassis is so large that it must make it harder to turn, but the &#14696 model is almost a large and turned like a champ.

<b>Gas Mileage: </b>

This car gets adequate gas mileage, based on the fact that it is quite powerful and very large.  I&#146m not overly-joyed by it, but it does do much better on gas than my husband&#146s Xterra.

<b>Value: </b>

We paid right around $30,000 for this car, and in retrospect, I might have tried the Altima this time around had I had this consumer information before my purchase.  However, to say that I am unhappy with this car would be incorrect.  It is a fine automobile, and still a great value and lot of car for the money.  I must recommend it.
