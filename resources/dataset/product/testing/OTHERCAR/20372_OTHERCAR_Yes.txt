            I started out looking at the RAV4 and the CRV, but after reading mostly positive reviews on the Tribute, a car I didn't even know was available, I went to a dealer and decided it was exactly what I was looking for. I also looked at it's sibling Ford Escape model but the exterior styling of the Tribute won me over. The Escape was a little too truck like on the outside.

The performance, handling, and styling are superior to the other models I tried and the ride is truly carlike. The RAV4 or the CRV will offer better gas mileage. If you want the added power of a V6 the Tribute will serve you well. This is a very practical SUV for city use as the relatively short length fits easily into a normal parallel parking spot in metro areas. Just try to park a larger SUV into a compact parking spot, the Tribute does it very well. It is nice to have a vehicle with a large cargo area that fits into normal city sized parking spaces. The rear window that opens in addition to lifting the cargo door is also superior to the RAV4 or CRV models that have rear doors that swing to either side since you can still get into the cargo area even if you have another car parked up against your rear bumper.

After 6 weeks of driving an ES V6 4x4 model I have found very little to dislike. I have now driven in bumper to bumper traffic, city traffic, curvy open roads, mountain roads, and open freeways and have found the handling to be superb. My other car is a BMW 325 convertible, but the Tribute is at least as fun to drive and the handling and performance are comparable.

The interior is not elegant, but it is functional. Every review will point out that the steering column mounted shifter is too long and gets in the way of the premium audio volume control, but this is a very minor negative in an otherwise well put together package. This is the only real complaint I have about this car after 2 weeks of driving it. I have also had some problems with condensation in the passenger side headlight but will be having the dealer look at that when I go in for service next time.

If you are looking for a luxurious interior, skip the Tribute and move up to the Acura, Lexus, or Mercedes SUV's but also be prepared to pay from $10-$25k more for the added luxury. The Tribute's interior door panels are a cheap feeling molded plastic. Padded vinyl or leather would have contributed to a higher quality interior, but when you consider the price for a complete package including V6, 4x4, ABS brakes, sunroof, leather seats, and 6 CD in dash changer the Tribute is priced very competitively with the RAV4 or CRV models given that it has a more powerful engine and significantly better performance.

The biggest negative right now is availability of the various models. The dealers just can't get enough to keep up with demand right now. I initially placed an order with CarsDirect.com. While the price was good, it required that I place a factory direct order and the earliest they could promise delivery was January-February and this was on an order placed in early November. I finally bought mine at a local dealer and had to pay slightly above MSRP with some dealer added options. But I subsequently checked out a dealer in a suburban area and found a much broader selection of in stock models so my recommendation would be that you shop as wide a range of dealers as possible before buying. 

<b>Who should buy?</b> Anyone wanting the functionality of an SUV with good performance and handling in a compact size at a price under $25K. The looks are great. I recently had someone ask me at a stoplight how much this car costs because they liked it so much. It definitely has a look that gets attention. 

<b>Who should pass?</b> Anyone looking for a compact SUV with a luxurious interior and impeccable detailing. The Tribute ES model is functional and comfortable, but it is not a luxury SUV. 

<b>Who else should pass?</b> If you want a SERIOUS 4x4 this probably isn't the car for you. It is based on a car frame and it is tuned for the driver who spends 90% or more of their time on-road as opposed to off-road. There is no low range gearing option, so if you want to do serious off-road 4x4 driving look at a Toyota 4Runner, a Nissan XTerra, or another truck based 4x4, but once again be prepared to spend $10K more and give up the carlike ride.
