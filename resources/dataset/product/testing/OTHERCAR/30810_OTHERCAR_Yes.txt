            This was my second digicam, and it's a blast.  Insanely cheap at about $275 online, the cam is a great first or adjunct camera.  

I use mine for ebay pics and stuff for my website. 

The 340 has been replaced now by the 360 (much the same, but some tweaks), so expect to see the 340s drop in price even more.  

I <b>strongly encourage</b> using NiMH or even NiCad rechargeables in whatever digicam you buy; alkalines are insanely ill-suited for digicam use and will disappoint.  Arm yourself with two sets of NiMH and get the all-singing, all-dancing MAHA 4-aa charger.  You'll never go back.<br><br>
