            I must start with the fact that I really do love to drive my Mazda Protege.  
First, the reason I bought my Mazda was because I needed a four door car before my first child was born.  But being in my early twenties, I also wanted something that was still sporty but also a &quot;family car&quot;.  The Mazda Protege jumped out at me when I was car buying because it fit exactly that. 
I had never owned a Mazda before but I must say I have no regrets.  Great for my little family of three.
I must say that I do have a husband over six feet tall and he is not comfortable in the back seat at all. Since he rarely ever sits back there, we have absolutely no other complaints.
A fun, sporty little car that gets great gas mileage.
