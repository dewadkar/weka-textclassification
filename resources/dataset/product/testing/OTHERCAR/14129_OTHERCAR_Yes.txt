            This review is for the 190E 2.3 liter four-cylinder, automatic version.  This was Mercedes Benz's least expensive model that they offered in the U.S.  My car came equipped with every option including power seats for both the driver and passenger seats.  Mercedes probably has designed the best power seat switches of any auto maker.  They are located on the doors of the car and are shaped just like the seat of the car.  Mine included power headrests that go up and down.  Other features that are normally included with the car are power moonroof, folding driver's armrest, automatic climate control, power windows, power door locks, full-size spare tire with alloy rim and alarm.  The interior of my car came with what Mercedes Benz calls "MB Tex".  This is a very high level vinyl material that they use for the seats.  You may think, vinyl? But believe me, the vinyl they use is such high quality, it can easily be mistaken for leather.  Because it is so similar to leather, like leather, it is very cold to the touch on winter days and very hot to the touch during the summer.  I would strongly suggest using sheepskin covers to avoid this. 

If you compared the interior and exterior dimensions of this car, it is very similar to another I owned, a second-generation Saturn SL2.  Both are within an inch in length of each other, approximately 177 inches.  Interior dimensions are very similar as well.  The Mercedes has 90 cubic feet of interior space vs. the Saturn at 91 cubic feet.  The Mercedes has slightly less head room than the Saturn, approximately a .5 inch difference.  This is probably due to the fact that in the Mercedes you sit more upright vs. the Saturn which has the seat closer to the floor. The 190 has the same leg room for the front seats as their standard S-Class cars.  Rear shoulder room, hip room and leg room are almost the same as the Saturn.  The trunk space is also similar to the Saturn at 12 cubic feet.

Driving the Mercedes around town, it has pleasant manners.  Very easy to drive and is easy to park due to it's tight turning radius of 34 feet.  The Saturn for comparison is around 41 feet.  Spirited driving doesn't elicit much body roll or even squealing of the tires.  Driving on the freeway, the Mercedes has only an adequate amount of power for acceleration and passing.  I have seen specifications for the 5-speed version in Car and Driver for 0-60 times of 11.4 seconds and for the automatic at 10.8 seconds.  During this era of Mercedes Benz manufacturing, their automatics always performed better than their 5-speed counterparts except for top-end speed.  You have to remember that this engine only produced 130 HP with only 146 ft-lbs of torque to move a car weighing 2900 lbs.  For comparison, the Saturn with a 1.9 liter DOHC engine produces 124 HP with 124 ft-lbs of torque for a car weighing 2400 lbs.  Yes, the Saturn is quicker to 60 mph but doesn't do it with such grace as the Mercedes.  

The extra weight of the Mercedes helps to isolate you from the outside world.  Driving at freeway speeds, the Mercedes only registers 68 dB on my sound level meter.  The Saturn registered 74 dB!  That is four times louder than the Mercedes.  Because this Mercedes is using a 2.3 liter four, it obtains excellent gas mileage for a Mercedes or for any car for that matter.  I routinely get low to mid 20s in the city and low 30s on the highway on a gallon of gas.  The downside to this great gas mileage is that this car must use premium unleaded.  What most people don't realize with this car is that the suspension that came with this car started Mercedes Benz to design their higher-line models to have the same suspension.  The rear suspension which is a 5-link multi-link independent suspension was the suspension eventually incorporated throughout the Mercedes Benz line.  This car which is considered a compact, has a ride and feel of a much larger car.  Even closing the doors gives you the impression that this car was built from a slab of granite.  It feels that solid.  

Unfortunately, because it is a Mercedes, replacement parts and servicing is more costly when compared to a domestic auto.  Luckily, my Mercedes has been very reliable through the years I have owned it.  If you are looking for a comfortable commuter car with all the luxury features, you can't go wrong with this car.  Also, it is a safe car as well.
