            If there's one thing I'm proud of, it's my VW. It's small enough that I don't feel overpowered in it, yet large enough to contain everything about me and my life. And safe too!

I bought my 1996 VW Golf GL (4 doors with hatch) when I was looking for a dependable, yet fun car right after I had my baby. As soon as I took it for a test drive, I knew I wanted it. And I still feel the same way 4 years later. In fact, I'm planning on buying it when my lease is up in June.

What I love most about this car is that it saved my life. When I was in a bad auto accident a few weeks after I bought it, I walked away from my totaled vehicle with a bandage on my arm. My daughter was in the car with me (8 months old then) and received nothing but a few bruises from her car seat. I never felt the airbag. I was told by the officers that if I didn't have an air bag, I probably would of snapped my neck and put my head through the windshield. I thank God every day that I chose to buy the car when I did and that it was equipped with air bags. 

I don't know much about cars, as far as the mechanics go, I just know that I have a very dependable and safe vehicle. It is great in the snow, gets great mileage to the gallon, the stereo system is incredible and repairs are inexpensive. It is also very deceiving on how roomy and spacious it us. Babies come with a lot of gear and it can hold it all. Worried about the terrain? This car has been trekking up mountains, coasting down highways, and beach-bound, with never a problem. Also, the staff at VW are always helpful and informative. 

Coming from an average Joe Schmo, this car rocks!
