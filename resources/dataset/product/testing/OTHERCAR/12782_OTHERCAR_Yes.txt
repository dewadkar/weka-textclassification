            Logically, one should be able to sum up the Integra GS-R sedan with just a number and an acronym: <b>8100 rpm</b>.  The two, of course, represent the redline for that miracle of engineering, Honda's VTEC engine.  While this may not mean much to most people, think of it this way: when you push it, the Integra's engine sings higher than you do, even when you're belting out Roxanne in the shower.

Unless you take it there, there's no clue to the banshee beneath the hood.  Around town, it's as quiet, reliable, and as unobtrusive as any Civic.  Get above, 4500rpm, though, and -- to paraphrase Mike Myers -- it <i>wails</i>.

This, then, is the essential paradox of the Integra.  Nothing about the car shouts performance.  The blandly attractive exterior is nothing to write home about, and certainly isn't nearly as distinctive as the subtly tense curves of Audi's A4, or VW's chunky Jetta.  The environment inside is stark, functional, and occasionally let down by the low quality of the plastics used for some parts of the dashboard.  In some places, the materials used simply feel cheap.  Even the Honda Accord, several thousand dollars less expensive, seems to have an interior of higher quality.   Don't let the plastics fool you, though -- the Integra is extremely reliable and well screwed together, even if its doors don't close with the Teutonic <i>thud</i> of some of its European rivals.

Get out on a smooth, curvy road, though, and the Integra is a blast.  The steering is quite precise, and the short throws and positive feel of the gearbox are a perfect complement to the engine.  When pushed close to the limit, things break down a bit -- there's a fair bit of body roll, and the tires don't grip as one would expect -- but its natural tendency toward understeer keeps things under control.  If you're really interested in top performance, a some new tires and possibly an anti-sway bar on the rear suspension would make it grip better and understeer less.  On rougher roads, the ride becomes a touch harsh and jiggly.

Despite the mechanical nirvana, though, the Integra ultimately doesn't inspire a lot of passion.  Perhaps its the chintzy interior, or the blandness of the exterior styling.  It's a ruthlessly competent car, and its engine alone is possibly worth the price of admission, but in the end it feels somehow lacking in character.  For quick, reliable transportation, you can't do better.  If you're looking to be inspired, look elsewhere.
