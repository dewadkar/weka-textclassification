            In 1996 I co-signed for my daughter on a new Camry. I had always bought American made autos, but this car made me change my opinion. Especially now that they are put together in KY. I wanted something safe and solid. Have you ever pushed on the hood or fenders of a 1955 Chevy or Ford, those things were built tough. They had steel in them,the hood didn't buckle when someone sat on it. I've found the same thing to be true in the Camry,very tough and solid. This car has a very nice and well made interior,especially if you have children. My daughter and son in law have now had this car for almost 4 years ,&quot;no problems at all&quot;. The car has a four cylinder motor. I was amazed at the power and acceleration. I have a 
nephew who is a highly trained GM mechanic, young guy, who's into speed and performance. I asked him about the four cylinder Camry. He, too, is impressed with the Toyota four cylinder. He said Toyota's four cylinders are about the strongest and most dependable 4 cylinder motors around. As I said before, I usually buy American made cars, this car and the fact that I know people that work for the Toyota plant in KY who are well paid and well treated,helped changed my mind. I like to hear about companies that treat their people well and let them enjoy good wages for doing good work. The ride in the Camry may not be the top of the line luxury vehicle, but it's pretty good. I think the price is a little steep for the top models, but this is America, you get what you pay for. Stick with the 4 cylinder in this car,it's has enough power and you'll save money.
