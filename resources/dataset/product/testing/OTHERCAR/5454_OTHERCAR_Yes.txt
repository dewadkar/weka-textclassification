            My dilemma (when I originally wrote this review) was the race between having the car long enough to be able to write intelligently about it and not waiting too long that it&#146s not going to be one of the first reviews on it.  I&#146d had it a week when I wrote the review and I still like my car a lot 2 years later.) 


<b>Dreams and all that stuff</b>. (I like to have a rare musical reference in some of my reviews) 

But the thing that prompted me to write the review was a dream. I hate it when people tell me about their dreams&#133. even if I was in it. (This seems to be the big reason why they think I&#146d be interested in knowing that they dream that I was in some other city or wearing some ridiculous combination of garments or was in love with a mandolin player or some such rot.) So, I&#146ll spare you too many of the details of my dream other than to say that in it my brand new car had this weird thing where some strangers were able to unlock it with their Honda key. (My sleeping brain is even weirder than my awake one.) This ticked me off! And they aren&#146t even real people.  [Why????? I don&#146t know.] So, I took the dream as the sign to write the car review. 


<b>Prep Work</b> 

So, my lease of my <i>Mazda Prot�g�</i> was going to be up on April Fools Day and I began my search for something new. My finances limited me to some extent, and I&#146d had done business with this dealership for many years and thought it would be to my advantage to work with them again.  The dealership sells Mazdas, Hondas, and Acuras, as well as the typical selection of Pre-Owned cars. (Don&#146t you just love euphemisms?) I&#146ve had a few Mazdas and I&#146ve had a Honda before. I thought I&#146d be looking mostly at the lower end cars in each category, but didn&#146t know if I wanted to get another Mazda Prot�g�, even though I liked it just fine. (Here&#146s the time to explain why I have left my lame very early review of it on my Epinions repertoire. I like to see how far I&#146ve come in both my writing skills and my understanding of the site. It&#146s a pretty pathetic review, but it&#146s where I was at the time.) 

I looked on Epinions, in Consumer Reports, glanced at cars on the road and talked to lots of people. That process made me want to look at Acuras if I could manage it financially. Otherwise I was resigned to getting another Prot�g� or a Honda Civic. I looked on the <i>Acura</i> website (http://www.acura.com) which had this cool thing that you could pick out your colors and features and it shows you what your car will look like. It also had the ability to enter a different car for comparison of features and price, which was helpful when I was trying to narrow down my choices. I made the fateful mistake of test-driving the <i><b>Acura Integra</b></i> and that was the thing that convinced me that it would be worth the extra $50 a month compared to a Prot�g�. 


<b>Finally! Some superficial, but pertinent details</b> 

I promise I&#146ll tell you about the car. Really! But I&#146m not mechanically inclined so I&#146ll tell you what I&#146ve found out and read, as well as about my car itself and how I like driving and owning (leasing?) it. I got the lowest-priced <b>2001 Acura Integra</b>, which is the LS. I prefer a 5-speed even though this experience has taught me that the resale value for automatics is better. But I&#146m going to have this car for at least 4 years, so I got the stick. I also found out that white cars have a better resale value. This was a coincidence because that was the color I preferred. This model also comes in silver, green, a fairly bright blue, red, and black. I didn&#146t want to pay extra for leather seats because I like cloth better anyway. Most of the interiors are either black or charcoal, but apparently the black car has tan upholstery. Even the bottom of the line comes fully loaded. My car has electric everything-windows, locks, moon roof, and antenna (for the CD player that&#146s included). Of course it has air-conditioning. (I think almost every new car has AC now, don&#146t they?) Cruise control is also included. There is a windshield wiper for the back window too. (This was something sorely missed on an old RX-7 that I&#146d owned.) Like most (if not all) new cars, my car has dual air bags, child-safety locks, and anti-lock brakes. One thing that I never had known before is that all <b>Acuras</b> come with Roadside Assistance included (for 4 years). (If only they included free car washes because I really like the way it looks when it&#146s clean.) They gave me an <b>Acura</b> key ring and pen and just sort of treat you right considering you&#146re buying the lowest rung of their cars (if you don&#146t include the Hondas that they also manufacture). 

Some of the things I&#146d read about (which pertained to the 2000 and 1999 models) are worth mentioning, even if they&#146re fairly inconsequential. Apparently, the cup holder on the previous years was directly in front of the CD player, making it difficult or messy to put in a disc. They must have listened to some feedback (like a good company does), because it is not really in the way any longer. Another complaint I&#146d read about is that there is no indoor release for the hatchback. That is still the case, but having had a hatchback open up while I was driving, I understand the rationale for that decision. It can be unlocked from the inside, but there is a latch has to be released manually. The locks are set up logically, though in that when you unlock the hatchback it unlocks the rest of the car. (I have found this very helpful when it was raining after I'd put something in the back. It was nice to only have to stand there fumbling for my keys once instead of twice.) The last thing that I remember as a negative in the reviews I&#146d read is the styling of the body of the car. I think the complaint was that it hadn&#146t been updated. I think it may be a matter of preference, but I like the styling of the body better than the so-called updated cars that I see. In fact, the sporty look of the car was a significant factor in my decision. I think a lot of people must agree because I see them everywhere. 


<b>Performance</b> 

The drive and handling of my car is really nice. It is responsive to steering and acceleration. The ride is very sound compared to the <i>Prot�g�</i> that I&#146d been driving for 3 years. The engine is 140 horsepower, 1.8 liter and I&#146m told its aluminum. (The truth of the matter is that I have no idea if there&#146s an advantage to aluminum, but I figure it makes the car lighter than if it was made of steel and less expensive than if it was made of platinum.) I didn&#146t need or want to pay extra for VTEC (which would bring it to 195 horsepower), but it is available in a more expensive model. Some other things (that you might understand and care about more than I do) include double-wishbone suspension, dual-overhead-camshaft, 4 cylinder, 16 valve, variable power assisted steering, and 4 wheel disc brakes. If you want to know about things like bore & stroke, redline, torque, powertrain, displacement, compression ratio, induction system, or valvetrain, I&#146d suggest going to the website. (It would only be plagiarism if I copied it here, since I don&#146t know what the heck I&#146d be talking about.) 


<b>Dimensions</b> 

If you like to know this sort of thing, the car is 52.6 inches high, wheelbase is 101.2 inches, length is 172.4 inches, overall width is 67.3 inches, and ground clearance is 5.9 (unless you modify it, of course). In the interior, headroom for the front is 38.6 inches, which works well for my 5&#1461; �&#148 height, but wouldn&#146t be good for you if you&#146re a basketball-player type. Legroom in the front is 42.7 inches. (I&#146m getting a little bored here, so you must be too. Again, please refer to the website for other details like hip and shoulder room, or passenger and cargo volume.) 


<b>Features</b> 

What I do know is that I have a 4-year/50,000 mile limited warranty including accessories. The tires are Michelin radials. I like the sound system a lot. It has 6 speakers and an anti-theft feature that makes it useless if stolen. The heating and air-conditioning controls are easy to control and reach. Driving the car is comfortable, although the back seat is a bit small. It has room for your legs back there, but it&#146s certainly not roomy. The gas tank holds 13.2 gallons, which isn&#146t huge, but the expected gas mileage is pretty good at 25 city/ 31 freeway. The back seats fold down to allow for extra cargo space, but I am a little hesitant to put my bike in there.

I enjoy my <b>Acura Integra</b> and haven&#146t lost it in the parking lot&#133yet. I haven&#146t had any problems with it and hope I don&#146t. If I do I&#146ll be back to edit this quicker than you can say &#1473; channel Anti-Lock braking system with four wheel speed sensors and electronic/hydraulic control unit&#148.
