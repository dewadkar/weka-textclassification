            A little over a year ago, while mulling over the decision to propose to my girlfriend I decided to finally buy my first new car.  I had been driving a 1988 Toyota Camry which I really liked, but it was getting old and lots of miles on it.  My girlfriend told me that if I bought a new car, to buy one that was &quot;family-oriented&quot;.

Figuring that I was going to marry her anyway, I might as well get a vehicle that was reliable, gets decent gas mileage, and looks semi-sporty.  I enslaved my father into helping me peruse all of the choices out there, and there are a lot of choices.  Every car dealership we visited was sure that I would like their particular car the best.

All in all, we visited Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Honda, Toyota, and Acura dealerships.  You noticed that no American dealerships showed up on that list.  There is a reason.  

I had owned American cars previously and had some poor luck with them.  Some of this could be blamed on the previous owners, but when a four year old car has loose buttons, interior trimming falling off, and little &quot;Hiccups&quot; that you have to solve, you finally get the picture and buy a little rice-grinder.  

The Toyota Camry I selected, I never had any trouble with, so I decided to stick with Japanese autos.  Out of the vehicles we looked at, we made a list of what we liked the best.  

The Nissan Maxima ranked high on our list, but it was just too expensive.  The Nissan Altima was nice, but I just didn't like the way it looked.  The trunk was just too short and it made the car look compressed.  The Toyota Camry was great but it was pretty expensive too.  

I checked out the Honda Accord EX model, (Face it, if you are going to spend that kind of coin, you might as well go for the top of the line model, because if you don't, you'll wish you had later on down the road).  I liked the Honda's looks once they threw a spoiler/wing (an $600 option) on the trunk.  The double wishbone suspension made cornering nicer when you are feeling a bit froggy.  The 150HP VTEC engine gives it enough power to be sporty, but not enough to get you into real trouble.  

The interior is laid out nicely and is comfortable.  Keyless entry is a real luxury which spoils you to death.  Nothing sucks worse then coming out of the grocery store carrying a couple of bags during a rainstorm and having to fumble around with the keys to open the trunk.  With Honda's keyless entry, just hold the trunk button down for a second and -pop- the trunk opens for you. Honestly, I haven't found anything that I don't like about this car yet.  

I kind of wish that I had spent the extra $1500 and gotten a V-6, but the inline 4 cylinder does its job.  I bought it in July of 1998 (It's a 1998 model) and now with 22,000 miles on it I have only had it in the shop for oil changes.  No squeaks, rattles, or problems have been found with it yet.  It's a bit more expensive than the American cars, but I would rather pay more for reliability.<br><br>
