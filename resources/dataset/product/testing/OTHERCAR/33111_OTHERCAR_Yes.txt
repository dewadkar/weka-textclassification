            I bought this vehicle used, it had 106K miles on it, I was the third owner of it in 98. It was stated as reliable, and decent on gas mileage. After driving it, I fell in love with it, I have had no major problems with it, most replacements have been because of normal wear and tear, with a few exceptions. The 4wd actuator that kicks everything into 4wd went out, but that was covered under a recall, and the wiper motor also went out, also covered under recall. I have just recently replaced the transmission at 170K which is not too bad, I think it went out mostly because of the racing I have done with it, that tends to heat up the transmission fluid way too hot, so that was my fault, not because of GM. The engine has been very reliable, and nothing to complain about, besides the engine not having near as much power as I'd like for it to have (racing, again). I used to do some hauling for my father, in which I would pull a 2ton trailer around, and it handled fine. The 4wd is excellent, I have taken my truck in the mud, and had no problem, as well as climbed some extremely steep hills and had no problem, this thing can handle, and can do way more than what any normal driver would want to do.
However, I do think they should improve in several aspects of these vehicles.
Straight Axle = a necessity
Rear Disk Brakes = would be nice
Stronger EFI engine = desirable
Taller ride = also desirable

I have done many things to my truck to make it faster, and taller, including lift and tires. My Yukon is not "top heavy" but it doesnt ride like a lowered car, so that has to be expected. Don't buy this vehicle with the wrong expectations.
