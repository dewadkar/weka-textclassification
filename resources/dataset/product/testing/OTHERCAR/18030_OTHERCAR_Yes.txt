              I purchased my '84 Toy Van from a lady who had had it for some time. At first, I was not sure of my purchase decision, which was based on few critera: a) I Needed a Van, b) Must be less that $2,000.00, and c) I Needed a Van. On the way home from the purchase, a 3 hour drive, I was rather impressed with it's handling and performance. I have had several van's in the past, such as a Ford Aerostar, a Windstar, Sienna, an old 64 Chevy 3-door etc, and have driven several different types and makes during my years in the Navy Seabees (some of the ones overseas were Very cool).
Anyway, the '84 Toy was and still is my favorite. It literally turns on a dime - the turning radius makes parking lot navigation a non-issue. And due mostly to the low center of gravity, almost mid-engine and 5-link rear suspension, it handles great at speed as well. My 5-speed was capable of 110+ MPH, and I have a ticket to prove it. The Officer was in Dis-Belief! Primarily, I used the van for basic transportation and moving computers around the state as part of my job. Fuel economy was great, usually better than 25MPG. I had removed the back seat so I could use the space for the comupters and sleeping. I finished the interior with thick carpet and sound-abatement material, and covered the tinted windows with curtans - accoustically correct, or so it seemed. The stereo system, 500Watts and speakers spread throughout, sounded Great. It was capable of off-road use, but because of the light weight over the rear wheels, compared to the front, traction is at a premium. There is a 4X4 available, but can't seem to get my hands on one. It has always been comfortable on long drives, as well as convenient for short hops across town. I truly Love this vehicle, would reccomend it to anybody, and will have another as soon as I can afford it.
