            I purchased this camera for my company a couple of years ago.  I use the camera at work to take photos of product for our web sites, catalogs, new product flyers and I have even submitted to magazines in the security industry for ads.

I found this camera to be VERY easy to use and it takes great pictures, although sometimes I had difficulty getting the pictures to lighten up.  The Flash if used would burn out some of the photos, but I was using the camera for professional uses, which is not what it is designed for.  I have borrowed the camera several times and have used it at home.  This is one of the best &quot;toys&quot; I bought for work and play!

The best part is that it uses a standard 1 1/4&quot; diskette!<br><br>
