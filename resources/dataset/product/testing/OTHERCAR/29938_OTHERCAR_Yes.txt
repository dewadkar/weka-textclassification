            I own several digital cameras from the cheapie 640x480 to a high dollar 2 megapixel. Of them all this camera has become my favorite. I paid $140 for it in May of 2001 and originally bought it for a family member. But upon testing it I fell in love. It is an excellent camera not only for the price but all around. It is the smallest and lightest of all my cameras. It comes with its own 4 rechargeable AA batteries with charger and only uses two at a time. It also comes with a 4 meg Smart Media card and can use up to a 16 meg. The 4 meg stores about 40 on 1024x768 average setting. 
This camera has an excellent LCD screen, the batteries last pretty long, and there are several excellent settings such as a Macro mode, self timer, exposure and zoom settings. It uses a serial connection to download, not the quickest but not too bad either, just go do something else if you have a lot of pictures to upload. Has a picture option for 640x480, then two for 1124x768 a regular and a high resolution, both are great. It also has a continuous picture settings so that you press the shutter button and it takes multiple pics just like a high dollar film camera.
But what is the best feature of this camera? Even on the best image setting it takes a picture and is ready for the next one after 1 or 2 seconds. All my megapixel cameras take forever to recharge their flash or cycle through saving their picture. This camera is instantaneous, it is great, it works most like a film camera. You get a lot of features, quick and light use and for an excellent price.
