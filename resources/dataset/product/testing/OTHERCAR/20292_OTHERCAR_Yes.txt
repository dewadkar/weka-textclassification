            My friends refer to my car as a &quot;puddle jumper,&quot; but most of the time I am very satisfied with this automobile. It never fails to start, has withstood all the accidental abuse I have caused it, and even made it through (practically intact) when hit directly with a major tornado.

If I had more money to spend, I would purchase a car with more luxury items and more power, but for the price, the Nissan Sentra was an excellent purchase.

I really love the fact that I can fit my car into tiny parking places, and the way it responds to my every command.

I don't hate anything about my car, but I would like to have more luxuries -- CD player, smoother ride and more comfortable seating.

I think the Sentra is a perfect car for students, people who commute to work (but make sure you purchase the CD player), and young people purchasing a first car.<br><br>
