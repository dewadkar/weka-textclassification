            Best car I have owned: compared to dodge stealth and bmw 325i(both much more expensive, I don't know why though!). Great response for a 4 banger, good sounds for a 4 also. Feels very solid, haven't had any problems yet, 22000 miles currently! This car is very responsive.... power, handling, and just the general feel of its ride. It feels like you can trust it and it will basically do whatever you want. Very slick and awesome performance. Interior needs more personality. Its a fun car with great reliability and decent gas mileage. If I were you I would definately consider buying this car
