            I got this vehicle about one year ago (99) because of the great performance and value of the 94 model I had.The 94 was a 4 cylinder but had a great low gear for pulling and hauling.The 99 how ever is a 6 cylinder.It simply has guts!I Have the sport suspension with wider tires. I don't think you could sling it off the road.This truck handles more like a car with a bed.I sits a little lower with the sport suspension.This is the truck for the fellow that has to take small loads,pull a boat,or just have a truck.How ever because of the suspension I would not recommend taking it to difficult off-road trips.It's not built for that.          <br><br>
