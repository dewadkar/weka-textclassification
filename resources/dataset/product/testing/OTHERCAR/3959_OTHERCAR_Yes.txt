               I had the opportunity to drive the &quot;L&quot; Series V6 Saturn for about 3000 miles and I was truly impressed.  Although the car has a relatively plain look, the feeling you get once you sit in this car is much different.  The car is very comfortable with leather interior, wood grain accents, and heated power seats.  I am a taller individual, 6'2; I had more leg and headroom than I needed, this is very important to taller drivers.  The Saturn has good-sized cup-holders and the CD controls are easy to use.  
   
   The big deal about this car goes further than the comfort; the performance is where this car comes through in great style.  Saturn's 3.0 liter V6 is very similar to the Cadillac Catera V6, the Cadillac's V6 has just a bit more horsepower but the two engines are virtually the same.  Step on the Saturn�s gas pedal and you will feel how powerful this car really is, 0-60 in the 7-second range (est.), that�s quick.  Handling is very good; I was truly impressed with the quality of the ride.  

   The �L� Series I am told, by the Saturn Retailer in my area, is built on the same platform as the Cadillac Catera.  These two cars uses virtually the same engine and are built on the same platform, why would anyone spend the extra $10,000 or more on the Cadillac.  The &quot;L&quot; Series V6 is only $22,000 loaded with everything, you should consider this Cadillac in disguise.          <br><br>
