            I have to write about this product, if only to warn other away from it!  No, I didn't buy this car, but I was forced to drive a rental for 19 days, and if I could have blown up the car afterwards, I would have.  Yes, I hated every minute.
 
The only good feature was the seating, very comfortable seats.
 
Now to the ugly bits.  The pick up on this car was non-existent, the mileage was unbelievably bad, the handling was sluggish and unsure, and the car braked like it was on snow.
 
Buy this car only if you have no other options and desperately need a car.  Otherwise, save your money and go elsewhere.<br><br>
