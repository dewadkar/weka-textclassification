            The time had come to supplement a Pontiac Transport minivan with 100,000 miles and a Saab 900S with 70,000 miles.  We searched the new vehicles on the road.  Our 12-year old son took one look at the Pontiac Aztek and declared it &quot;the coolest vehicle on the road&quot;.  Since we already own a Saab, most people will remark that we go for the unusual.  My husband test drove the Aztek for 30 minutes and described it as much more fun to drive and much more versatile than the SUV's that he was considering.

After some consideration, I leased an Aztek as a gift for the boys. I did choose to lease because I am not sure about the re-sale value.  Plus there is a special lease arrangement right now making the cost very attractive.

And we definitely do not have to worry about meeting our vehicle everywhere we drive it.  If you want to turn some heads, have some fun, and let people know that for sure age has not slowed you down -- this may be the vehicle for you.  

My son definitely thinks that his parents are cool now.<br><br>
