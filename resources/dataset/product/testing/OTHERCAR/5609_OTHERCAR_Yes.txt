            I had a stick shift...my job transferred me to S.F. I looked at most all compact cars for an automatic transmission...the best deal, all the way around, was the Mazda Protege. I purchased this car in March, 1997 and I haven't ever regretted doing so.

My little white car has plenty of front-seat space. I am 6' tall and I haven't ever felt cramped. The car handles beautifully...when going up a high grade, I slip into overdrive (which requires a simple switch which is located on the transmission shift) and basically pass all of the 4x4's, BMW's, trucks, etc. climbing the grade with me. It is pretty amazing the speed and pick up this car has...

The Protege I have is outstanding on gas mileage. It generally gets in the high 20's with a combination of town/freeway driving. When I have gone on trips I have gotten mileage in the 30's.

The upkeep has been another outstanding feature. I recently put new tires on (after 45,000 miles). They weren't really needed although they were starting to show ware...and, driving freeways so much, I like to be as safe as possible. The only other repair I have made is installing new brakes...this is due, I am sure, to the frequency of stop-start-stop traffic I frequently find myself in.

This car handles nicely on busy freeways. It is, on the other hand, easy and fun to drive...easy to park and maneuver in the city.

I love my little Protege...it has been great to me!<br><br>
