            Strong and Sturdy the 2001 Chevy Silverado 1500 is like a rock.  There's a reason why the Silverado is the number one selling truck in all of California.  From its great looks, to it's powerful engine everything about this truck says "excellence". Being a former Chevy employee I have driven these trucks non stop for days.  I must say that all the feedback we had gotten from Chevy owners was positive. Sit inside this truck and you don't really feel like you are in a truck at all.  The versatile backseat makes it great for family vacations because of the space and we know how squirming kids can get. You can get this truck in 4 doors to make it even easier. The power you feel in this truck is great too if you ever decide to take it to the snow you will have absolutely no problems moving up hill. I have recommended this truck to family members who then decided they needed to have a "Chevy experience". They are all pleased to this day with the handling and style that the Chevy Silverado posesses. The Estimated price for a 2001 Silverado 1500 is about $20,000 which is such a bargain compared to other trucks where you would expect to pay $35,000-$40,000.  And with $20,000 you get all power, cruise, automatic dimming rear view mirror, quality sound, and the list goes on. This truck is definitely every penny.
