            After being unable to see what was ahead of me, I decided to join the group (so to speak). As I had had 3 previous Honda autos of various models I again decided to look at the SUVs offered by Honda. 
I test drove the Passport and it was riding in a truck. Well, why not, it is on a truck chassis. Then I drove the 2000 CRV and that did it. It rides like a car as it is on a Civic chassis. It is up (in height)with the many other SUVs and trucks on the road today. I can finally see what is ahead of me. 
The ride is smooth. It is easy to corner and back-up. The attached spare tire (which is a real tire and not one of those that will get you to the repair business only) is situated low enough in the back so it is very easy to see out the back window. It does not obstruct the view.
If you wonder if this will go off road to explore the back areas, it will not. 
It has an automatic 4 wheel drive function in that if this feature is needed it will automatically go into the 4 wheel drive mode. It also has an overdrive if one decides to haul a trailer.
As with any SUV, I question if a short person would have ease of getting into the seat as it is taller than a car. As I am 5 feet 8 inches tall it is quite easy to get into but I do have to hike my leg up. Getting out of it is a breeze, one feels just like you can fall out of it.
The passing mode does not have the get up and go that my Prelude had and I rather miss that but then this is a different sort of vehicle. 
I opted for the in-dash 6 CD changer and the 4 extra speakers and it is a very good addition.
The passenger seat arm rest does not come standard so one has to purchase this extra if it is wanted, which is, to me, ridiculous to have to pay about $90 for an arm rest.
One nifty feature for the tailgater at games is that there is a table hidden in the back area. Open the back, lift up the carpeting and pull out the table.
For the persons who want a true off road SUV this is not the one for you.<br><br>
