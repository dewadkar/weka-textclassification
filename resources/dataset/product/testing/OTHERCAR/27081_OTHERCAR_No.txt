            Saab's radio ads about 'people who test drive a Saab and usually buy one' appeared to be 100% true for us. We were on the market for a new compact to medium size car considering Acura, Honda, Nissan and VW. We never considered SAAB before but one day shopping for a car we decided to test-drive a SAAB. Why not? We both fell for the 2001 9.3 model even though we were stuck on someone's driveway for quite some time trying to find out how to put this baby in reverse (If you never driven a SAAB before there are at least two weird features I noticed - reverse and the ignition between two front seats).
We got it the same day, in a dark blue color with tan cloth interior and manual transmission. 
After owning it for about 8 months here are my thoughts on high and low points of the car:
Pros:
Fun to drive
Powerful turbo engine (4 cyl)
Seats are comfortable for the most part 
The computer is sophisticated and provides a lot of useful info
On Star navigation system helps my geographically challenged spouse not get lost in space 
Cons
Why do you call this thing in the dashboard a cup holder?
(It is difficult enough to drive, talk on the cell phone, switch gears, and drink coffee, so why not help people with a normal cupholder?)
A driver doesn't really need the annoying SHIFT UP display  
The light indicator would be nice on AC button as it almost
impossible to tell if the button is depressed or not
Radio and CD player sound is average
