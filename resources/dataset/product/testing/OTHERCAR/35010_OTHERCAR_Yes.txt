            My wife and I were looking for a good used car to replace the junker I was having to push every day.  When the used car salesman show us this Mirage, we were curious.  We test drove it and looked at each other and said, &quot;This is the one&quot;. I hadn't given Mitsubishi a thought before.  Now I'm glad we did.

IT is the Mirage S Sedan 4doors with A/C and an automatic transmission.  The seats are comfy and the back seat is roomy for a subcompact car.  We average 27 mpg city and the factory installed radio is very adequate for our needs.  WE had to put it in the shop once to replace the engine/transmission stress place.  Other than that, the car is in mint condition and offers a very quiet ride and no rattling or squeaking. It looks and feels brand new.  We are blessed to have it.
It is the ideal first car for small families and college students and single people.  The upkeep has been minimal and is it cheap to fill up with these exorbitant gas prices.

However, if anyone has an Owner's Manual they would like to part with, please email me.<br><br>
