            When we found out we were getting a 1999 GMC Yukon Denali
                                               to test drive, everybody wanted to like the truck. Not just
                                               because we had to spend a week in it and not just because it's
                                               got a cool name-Denali, after the Alaskan National Park that
                                               boasts the highest peak in North America. No, we wanted to like
                                               it because we're big fans of the other sport-utes that grace GMC
                                               dealer lots: the Suburbans and Yukons that share the same
                                               platform with the company's newest baby. 

                    One rainy July week, I spent ample time getting to know the Denali. During my first hour in it, I almost
                    killed myself as well as other motorists on a slick, dark highway because the wildly flapping wipers
                    were streaking the windshield. I had difficulty parking the truck between two cars in a crowded
                    bookstore parking lot, and I almost knocked off the passenger side mirror while trying to negotiate
                    the course of my bank's ATM drive-through. Luckily, things improved drastically over the course of
                    the week. 

                    Putting the Denali through its paces on a test route that
                    included highway, backroad and mountain driving, I came
                    away impressed with the handling and power of the truck. The
                    most fun, however, was when I took the beast camping. My
                    husband and his college buddy had headed to the mountains a
                    day earlier in our sturdy Subaru Outback. Scouting around for
                    the perfect camping spot, they chose a secluded, woodsy area
                    near the trailhead of Quandary Peak. To get to the campsite,
                    they drove through two small streams without a second
                    thought. Throughout the night and the next day, however, the rain poured down without relief. At 3
                    p.m. on Friday, I got a call from a pay phone. The message: Meet us in Breckenridge tonight � bring
                    the Denali. It seems the rains had turned the two small streams into one huge pond that our Subaru
                    barely waded through at the last crossing, and the guys were stuck in town. 

                    So to the mountains we went and rescued the boys from
                    having to spend the night in a dry, clean hotel room. I picked
                    them up at the local tavern and drove to the campsite turnoff.
                    Even I hesitated with the Denali when I saw the apparently
                    bottomless pond that I was supposed to navigate. After some
                    quick prayers, however, I hit the accelerator and the Denali
                    swam through the black water like it was born with fins. We
                    made several trips back and forth across the stream that night
                    and the next day, rescuing other unfortunate souls who had
                    ventured to cross in lesser vehicles or on foot and who were
                    now stuck on the wrong side. Next time they go camping, I bet they'll snag a Denali first. 

                                             Complaints about the Denali included shallow cubbies that made
                                             sunglasses, CDs and cameras thunk to the floor while turning,
                                             rubber foam that was poking out of the driver's side door handle,
                                             and an annoying blind spot hindering rear visibility where the
                                             side-by-side cargo doors met. Though the panel door configuration
                                             is nice in theory, we found that they constantly closed in on us while
                                             we tried to load gear into the back, and it took too much time and
                                             energy to steady them so that they would stay open. Also, every
                    time I got the driver's seat positioned to where I could reach the pedals, I ended up knocking my
                    knees trying to get out of the truck. 

                    Though the front and rear seat heaters were appreciated, their
                    poor location made it impossible to turn them on without
                    opening the door and leaning your head out to see what you
                    were doing. Otherwise, you ended up adjusting your
                    automatic seat when you wanted to turn on the seat heaters or
                    toasting your backside on a 90-degree day when you meant
                    to increase lumbar support. 

                    Special enhancements that we applaud include the outside
                    temperature display and compass in the rearview mirror,
                    one-piece rear floor mat that preserved the cleanliness of the entire floor area, tissue holder in the rear
                    console, availability of a CD player and a six-CD changer, captains chairs, visor extenders, integrated
                    cellular phone controls, and retained accessory power. 

                    In some respects, we were obviously delighted with the Denali; in other areas, we were disappointed.
                    Let me explain. For a truck with a $43,000 price tag (up to $10,000 higher than the similar and
                    capable GMC Yukon, depending on options), we expected more than just a few luxury items and
                    gadgets tacked on as standard equipment. Like maybe replacing some of that cheap-feeling plastic
                    switchgear. Still, if you're planning to camp in a flood plain � <br><br>
