            We got this car because, we trust Mercedes. With a young son, my husband and I thought that this was a safe choice for our family. It is a very roomy car, and has a huge trunk! So those of us with children really find that a valuable asset. I can fit my peg perego plus groceries, plus a diaper bag AND his sand toys!! We LOVE this car! 
We have a 1993 300 SD. And although, it is not new, it runs like it. We've had this car since March 1998, and we have had very few problems. The main problem that we have had, is the vacuum seal. It also seems to be malfunctioning in some way.
Driving this car is a DREAM!! It is very smooth. The suspension is amazing!! You barely feel any bumps. The steering is amazing also. Very light and spins on a dime.
