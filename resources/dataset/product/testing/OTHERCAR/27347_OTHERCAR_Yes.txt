            We leased 3 Jeep Cherokees (NOT Grand) and they were MY HUSBAND'S car! I thought they rode like a buckboard and the sound system was NOT good.

BUT we both didn't like the LIBERTY and the dealer showed that we could lease this 2004 Grand Cherokee for about $15 more a month AND the buy out after 3 years was LESS ( a little) than for our 2001 smaller Cherokee Sport!

We got it with not only 4 WHEEL DRIVE but also can use ALL-WHEEL drive for any length of time. (My Gr Caravan has this and I love it=ALL WHEEL DRIVE ). In the Jeep it is 42RE pkg.

 CUSTOMER PACKAGE: 26E with Console,information center,traveler/mini trip computer, key-less entry, and better tires. (we LOVE the temp/compass that helps when you're lost and when you wonder if the rain might be freezing or not! Thought it was useless but found out differently)
 
ENGINE: 4.0l Power Tech 1-6  and it has PLENTY of power.When entering expressways there is plenty of POWER to get on at full speed! GREAT PICK UP!

Being short (5'3")ALL cars put pressure under my knees (can make leg numb) but with the Electric driver's seat adjustments-BOTH my 6' tall husband and I have a Wonderful driving position.  The BACK SEAT has tons MORE room for knees then the old smaller Cherokee. NOW the folks in the back seat are as comfortable as we are up front!

The sound system is vastly improved and since I like classical music I want to hear the lows as well as the high notes. In this car the music is clear and enjoyable.After all the wind, engine and tire noise in the small Cherokee this is a wonderful change for the better. THERE IS NO NOISE except for the HUM of the engine.

I took it on it's first trip. I had expressway and city driving and really enjoyed the trip. It was SO easy to drive and maneuver that I never got tired of driving.
The left stick on the steering wheel controls the lights and the directional signals.  The right one the windshield wipers AND the back wipers too. It is really good NOT to have to fish around to find the right switch while driving.
I got 22MPG and the car has only 150 miles on it so I expect it to improve a little.

After the awful ride in the small Cherokee (but my husband LOVED his little Cherokees) I can't say enough about the better ride of this car.

THE only two things that I think are ill-conceived are:

ONE: the back hatch has a thing like a juice box holder, (upside-down. To close the hatch and there is NO place to hold-onto with you fingers. Each time I shut it, I get finger burn. The handle was better idea!

TWO: The other DUMB thing is they moved the inside-door-handle (another juice box holder upside down) to the OPEN end of the door (other car it was closer to HINGE end) and so a short person has to stretch to reach it to shut a fully opened door.Plus the arm-rest is short with no place for your hand but this is minor.

The List price was $30,075 BUT they have TONS of discounts including one for if you EVER served in the military. (They was it's their way of saying "thank you" to servicemen present and past.)This car is much more affordable then you might think.

My husband thinks this Jeep Gr.Cherokee is HIS but I know I will enjoy driving anywhere in this one too! I am REALLY looking forward to our trips in it. When THIS lease runs out we will be buying it for sure.

THE ONLY REASON I don't give it an excellent is the gas mileage but then I think ALL AMERICAN cars have terrible gas mileage compared to where they COULD BE.

NOW I HAVE 600 MILES AND ONE TRIP ON THE ODOMETER:
I have to tell you I LOVE this car even more! THE KNOBS for the heater/A/C are BIG and EASY (don't need engineer's degree to operate it!) I got about 23mpg in combination driving! EASY to maneuver and easy to learn to operate the lights and wipers (front & back) from the two sticks on the steering column. Nice NOT to have to fumble and lean over to find the switches while driving.

IT is REALLY QUIET and the only change I'd make is--IF I lived in country with steep hills I'd get the bigger engine. BUT for here in the east, it is great!

I just discovered that my husband likes it so much he has ALMOST forgiven JEEP for not making the old smaller Cherokee anymore and he LOVED that car.
