            I've owned "lil emmy" (my 11-year old daughter named 'her' that, to differentiate from my husband's benz ("big emmy") for one year, and I still love going out to get in it!  

When this car was released in the summer of '01 as an '02 model, they were very hard to come by.  Even the dealers had a hard time obtaining one for a test drive, so after several trips to the Atlanta area dealers, we got to drive an automatic 'orion blue' coupe - the salesman had a predetermined course that put the car through it's paces - at one point we were flying up a blind, curving road, and I was sold!  The car handles like it's on rails, which is only enhanced by the addition of the C-7 package.  This package includes 17" tires, low profile Z-rated tires, color-keyed door handles, sporty chrome door sills, cool 'racing' pedals made of metal with rubber knobs to keep your feet attached. The package also included a larger exhaust tip, and a throaty-ier sound to the exhaust, compliments of some extra thing near the exhaust manifold that may or may not increase the horse-power, depending on who you listen to. The cost of this package was $750 - an extreme value, considering the tires it came with cost over $1200 alone, before discussing the cost of 4 17" aluminum wheels.

I decided to purchase the $700 Tele-Aid option due to the fact that it will call the police if the on-board computers sense that the car is off-center - say, if the car runs of the road and down a ravine.  It also calls if the air-bags deploy - it first calls into the car, and if there is no response, it will call the police. It will also call me first if the alarm goes off - which it has done on 2 occasions.  It tried my cell-phone, and then left a message on our house phone  that, although the alarm went off, (it gave the exact address the car was parked at - kind of scary in a way...), they didn't notify the police as the car was not moved after the alarm!!

There was a story posted on an MB chat board about some guy who was car-jacked at an intersection, and, with the guy in his car, who apparently was high and yelling to be taken somewhere, the driver pushed the tele-aid button under the guise of getting directions, and told the operator something to the effect that 'oh, someone just jumped in my car at the corner, and wants me to take him to blah, blah, blah.'  The operator apparently caught on to what he was saying, and asked if he needed 'assistance' from the authorities in getting to his 'destination', he said yes, the cops zero'd in on him, and arrested the would-be jacker!  I just re-upped at $270.00 for the next year - well worth it I feel.

I also upgraded the sound system to the Bose system - it is head and shoulder's above the basic system. This cost $610.00 It has a subwoofer and amp, in addition to the radio and speakers being made by Bose; though my 17 yr. old son thinks of my 'system' as a 'poser' i.e., I don't rattle windows driving down the street like he does, but hey, I've outgrown that - to some degree!  I also bought the dealer's CD player - when I ordered the car, it was the week before the price went up, so I 'only' paid, I believe, $700, and then only 1/2 of that - that was the only concession on price the dealer was willing to make!

The dual sunroof's are superb - they open the entire front seating area up to the air, while giving the backseat passengers a full, though non-functioning sunroof as well.  There is a sunscreen that can be closed at the push of a button if the sun is too much.  Again, on the MB board, some people have complained about the noise i.e. rattles, squeaks, coming from the sunroof.  My husband complained about this as well, but I never noticed any noises - I guess the radio was too loud.  Anyway, when I brought the car in for service, and complained about this, the dealer changed out the bellows in the roof - apparently more than a few people have complained.  This option also came with rain sensor windshield-wipers for a total of $995.00.  This is a cool thing - if it's drizzling, the wipers will speed up or slow down, or go off entirely, based on how I'm driving.  To invoke this option, the wipers must be left in the 'auto' mode, which, unfortunately, causes them to come on each time the car is started, thereby potentially scratching the windshield, or messing up a just cleaned one.

The absolute best option I have in the car is the integrated telephone with voice recognition.  Unfortunately, MB wanted over $2100. for this option, therefore I didn't get it when I ordered the car.  I was able to buy the phone (the standard Star-Tac with MB insignia) off Ebay.  While down at the dealer on an unrelated matter, we asked the salesman if he knew anyone who put the phones in on an after market basis - he did, and for $875.00, my phone is now completely wired into the fiber optic system and is as functional as if put together in Germany.

All in all, this is a great car.  It handles beautifully, looks great and is safe - with 8 airbags, 2 of which are side-curtains that come down out of the ceiling if there is a side impact crash.  These are all included as standard equipment.  BMW tried making a less expensive car a few years ago, the 318-TI.  They failed with that because they also lowered the quality of the whole car.  They made it a true entry level car.  That is not the case with the MB.  All the safety stuff, engineering, suspension, etc. are the same used in their other cars.  Sure, it's not a quiet as our E-320, but the E doesn't handle like this either!  Or is as much fun to drive.
