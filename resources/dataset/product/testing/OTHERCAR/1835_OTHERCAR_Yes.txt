            I have been the owner of Both the Ford and Mercury wagons. they had several features that made them the right car for a family of five. The Sable has a larger back seat than most cars and fits three squirming kids more comfortably than most wagons.
 Getting the optional more powerful engine is a smart choice. It gives the car the added power needed for more comfortable controlled driving.
 The major downside to the sable wagon is that although it is a good car, at 70,000 miles everything seems to want to give up. at 75,000 miles i needed a rebuilt transmission and a rebuilt engine. 
 In my opinion the car is a good lease or used car provided that the engine and transmission are checked by a mechanic first. even with all it's flaws, it is one of the few wagons that seats three in the back comfortably and is not incredibly expensive.   <br><br>
