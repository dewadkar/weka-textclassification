            Impressive. Decided on this one over the canon s50, since a lot of reviewers have come to the conclusion that the 4 megapixel sensor is better for this type of lens. The s50 seems to have trouble with purple fringing and such, something which I haven't encountered on the A80.

I'm no full-scale-expert, but the picture quality of the a80 has surprised me. Im quite convinced i made the right choice.

The layout of the buttons is very easy to get used to, and the pre-programmed modes works fine. I really like the two modes, c1 and c2, that you can program for yourself to whatever settings you like.

I have c1 programmed for indoor low light - tungsten whitebalance, iso 200, no flash.

c2 is programmed for tripod still life shots- 2 sec self-shutter release, iso 50, no flash, av 2,8.

The auto mode works fine, and the macro is very good.

Running in "Manual" mode gives you up to 15 sec shutter speed, so you can get wonderful night shots.

The battery life is impressive using ni-mh 2100 mha rechargeables. I took 700 photos on one set.

The swiveling LCD in a stroke of genious, and I won't buy another camera without it.

The menus are very easy to use and the software that comes with the camera is very good. I use Photoshop instead, but It might come in handy. The photo-stitch is very fun, you can make cool panoramas! Another nice feature is the remote capture, that allows you to control the camera settings and capture images directly to the computer, allowing for an "infinite" number of photos. I used this to make an animated movie, with the camera on a tripod. Time-lapse photography and webcam options are also available. good job, canon!



This is the perfect all-round camera. It's been said before, but I guess it's because it's true.

I've put up a few example photos here http://members.chello.se/uz/canon.htm
