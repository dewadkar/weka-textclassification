            I spent two months researching various digital cameras in various price ranges.  I wanted a camera that would satisfy end results in terms of additions to our home photo albums that would meet or exceed my 35mm film camera.  I was willing to spend a little more to get one that I would not have to "upgrade" or replace for many years.  After reading all the reviews I could find, it came down to this camera and the Canon.  The professional reviewers seem to like the Canon more, and I'm sure it's a great camera when it comes to abberations and all that other stuff that I haven't the slightest idea they're talking about.  However, the Olympus was several hundred dollars less and also has sound with its movie mode.  This camera has obviously been designed with the average home user in mind; the bells and whistles such as panorama and motion video with sound may not be "practical" to a professional user, but is perfect for consumer level tech junkies.

I have had the Olympus C-4040 for a couple of weeks now and I'm telling you, this camera is wonderful.  After about 30 minutes browsing through the instruction manual, I was up and running; changing resolutions, flash options, shooting 360 degree panoramas, and making quicktime movies.  The USB connection sees the camera as just another drive, so downloading and uploading is as easy as pie and no special software is necessary (the included bundle, however has some great utilities that are really easy to use).  

From a surveying/civil engineering design perspective, the 360 degree panorama was an unexpected joy.  How the software patches together separate photographs so flawlessly without any help from the user is beyond my comprehension.  Being able to see an entire work site from multiple points and 360 degrees is an enormous plus to guys in the office doing drafting design work.  It's in some ways better than actually being there.
 
This camera makes this idiot's snapshots look truly professional.  Using point and shoot mode, my pictures are super sharp with brilliant colors.  My wife has grown weary of my incessant "it's sooo much more than I expected" and living on my budget, I expected a lot!  I highly recommend the C-4040 to all users, I am very proud of it and thank Olympus for making such a great product.  Be sure to go ahead and get rechargeable batteries and a bigger smartmedia card for it to really take advantage of it.  

Did I mention I love this camera? I love this camera!
