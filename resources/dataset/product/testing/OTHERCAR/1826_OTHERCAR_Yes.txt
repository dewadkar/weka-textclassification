            I have owned many sports cars and convertibles. This is by far the easiest, most reliable, and best handling partner I have had yet.
I bought My 94 Miata in 1997 I wanted the 94 because it had the larger 1.8liter engine and all of the suspension upgrades that came with that year. Mazda also included a host of chassis braces in 94 that really stiffen up the body.


The Miata handles like a proper sports car should. It is light nimble and has very high cornering limits. All though the car does not have an overabundance of power from the factory, there is a very large after market. You can buy anything from full racing suspension-to- Turbo kits.
I have put on over 85,000 miles on this car and nothing has broken leaked or stopped working. Not only is this car a lot of fun and reliable,but I also average 27 mpg.
I love this car and could not imagine selling her for any reason.Mimi is a member of the family and she will remain one forever.
