            I've been offroading HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehichles)for the past four years.  I've also done quite a few treks out into AnzaBorrego and Baja California with old CJ-7s and Toyota Trucks when I was younger.  I've probably put 50,000 miles both on and off road since I've been riding HMMWVs.

They don't corner very sharply.  The heavy weight keeps the speeds down.  The wide wheel base can make small areas difficult to manuveur through.

The Weight allows you to bully over small trees (the book says 1/4 inch or less in diameter... but who actually goes by the book anyway), and helps your momentum carry you through rough patches.  The Wide wheel base helps to keep you from rolling through turns.

I've off roaded out in the desert and they performed very well.  I've off roaded in the jungle and my hummer did better than most.  I've been out in the snow, and well it sucked.  Mud that's less than knee deep is rarely a problem.  A wench is a must if your by yourself or with lightweight vehicles.  The water fording kit can change the fording depth from 30 to 60 inches.  A HMMWV is suppose to take on a 60 percent grade, which I have tested and proved.

This vehicle can pull some gear too.  My job uses all kinds of generators and heavy equipment with can throw over 3000 additional pounds of weight into the vehicle.  The HMMWV loses very little performance when compared to most off-road vehicles on the market.

You can break and mangle a HMMWV and it will still get you home.  This is always a plus when you find yourself out in the middle of the mountains when you notice that you have two flats and a bad oil leak.

You can travel 30mph for 30 miles on a flat tire by the book, but really you can stretch that distance even farther.  I've broke my HMMWV quite a few times, but it always gets me where I'm going.

I had more fun with the CJ-7s I used to run, but the HMMWV is definitely not as sensitive to the obstacles.  If your looking to seriously off road rough terrain then have at it.

Have fun
