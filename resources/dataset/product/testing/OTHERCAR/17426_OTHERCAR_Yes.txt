            One of the first reviews I wrote on Epinions was for my brand new '99 <b>Honda</b> <i>Passport</i>.  At that time, I was very excited to be buying a new SUV, and looking back I wonder if that excitement may have swayed my opinion on writing that review.  I have now owned my <i>Passport</i> for almost a year now and have put close to 10,000 miles on it.  I thought this would be a great time to write a follow up to my original review and see if I still feel the same as I did last year when I was still being intoxicated by that new car aroma.

First and foremost I will state that I haven't had any mechanical problems with my <i>Passport</i> as far as the engine is concerned.  However, there have been two recalls so far, which I find to be a major pain in the neck.  As I work 8:00 to 5:00 everyday, I find it difficult to find time to get my car in the shop, and since these recalls are the fault of <b>Honda</b>, I feel they should have to really bend over backward to accommodate their customers.  

The first recall was to replace some bolts on the rear suspension that had the possibility of becoming loose.  The mechanic at the <b>Honda</b> dealer explained that some of the bolts might have been used before some paint had completely dried.  Obviously, this was a fairly serious recall as it affected the ability to safely drive the vehicle.  I will add that the service work was completed in under an hour once the <b>Honda</b> dealers got the suspension kits in stock.   The second recall is for the passenger visor, which I haven't responded to as of yet.  

Recalls aside, I have had no problems with my <i>Passport</i>.  Am I completely satisfied with my purchase?  Well, that's a different question, but for the most part I can answer, &quot;Yes&quot;.  I am disappointed with the gas mileage, although not shocked by what I have discovered.  At the dealer, the <i>Passport</i> was listed as 16-MPG city and 20-MPG highway.  Somewhat of an exaggeration?  I would say so, but then again, I don't think it's overly wise to believe everything you see on a window sticker.

For the first few months my &quot;in city&quot; gas mileage was more in the 13 to 14-MPG vicinity, which I thought was pretty pathetic.   On my first road trip, that number only slightly increased to around 16-MPG.  I did a little research on the <i>Passport</i> and found some interesting information on gas mileage.  Several people stated that their mileage increased after their first oil change.  Although this seemed like a bizarre coincidence to me, I did notice a decent increase in my mileage after I had the oil changed.  I now have been getting close to 16-MPG in the city, and on a recent trip to Reno, entailing about 600 miles, I finally reached that coveted 20-MPG. 

Another complaint that I have is the ride in general.  I suppose this is a factor that cannot be completely discovered with a test-drive alone, but I will state outright that the <i>Passport</i> has a moderately stiff ride.  Unless the road is extremely smooth, you will feel pretty much every pothole and especially those speed bumps unless you slow down to a crawl.  I wasn't expecting a luxury car ride, but a little better suspension would have been nice. 

It's not all bad, however.  I have friends that own both a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Nissan Xterra, and I can confidentially tell you the <i>Passport</i> is roomier.  The Cherokee owner is always complaining about his spare tire that resides in the back storage area, easily claiming ï¿½ of the storage space.  The back seats in the Xterra rival those of an import economy car, while there is ample space for passengers in the <i>Passport</i> backseats, even if they are over 6 feet tall.  I've moved once since owning this vehicle, and I could really load this baby down with a ton of stuff, especially with the back seats folded down.

Another factor that keeps me happy is the powerful engine.  When I step on the gas pedal as I get on the freeway, this baby responds.  Even loaded up with 4 or 5 people, you can still feel some serious torque as the <i>Passport</i> accelerates.  Of course I would <i>never</i> break the law, but lets just say that I kept side by side with my friends V8 Cherokee on the freeway one day when we were putting the pedal to the metal.  

I still feel like I got a good deal when I bought this car.  Although not my ideal SUV, for the price I highly doubt I could have done much better.  I think the closest worthy competitor would be the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but if you've researched them at all you know those are well over $30,000.  I happen to think the <i>Passport</i> is a sharp looking vehicle, but that's a statement of taste and yours may very well vary.  I will state that next time I'm shopping for a car or SUV, I am going to pay much closer attention to the ride and suspension.  Where as I originally rated the <i>Passport</i> with 4 stars, I think I can fairly drop that down to 3 stars, which isn't saying I'm disappointed with this vehicle, just that it could be improved.

*NOTE* 
I really haven't had the opportunity to check out the 4WD on any severe terrain, although I can say the <i>Passport</i> switches in and out of 4WD with ease at the push of a button.  I will state that the button location is ridiculous, about 1 inch away from the Cruise Control on/off button.  This will probably never be a huge problem, but Honda does say <b>never</b> engage 4WD when traveling over 55 MPH, so who knows what the hell would happen if you accidently hit this button at 70 MPH or so...
