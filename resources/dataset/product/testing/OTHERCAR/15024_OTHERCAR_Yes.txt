            This camera has to be the best purchase I have made in my life.  It is so easy to use and makes emailing pictures a snap.  When I first decided I wanted a digital camera I knew I wanted one that the floppy disk fits right into.  I didn't want to deal with more hook ups to my computer.  The Sony was the one that met this criteria and many more.  When I email a picture to someone I am told that they cannot believe the quality of the picture.  Three of my family members have since gone out an bought a Sony. (Some have gotten the FD83 for the zoom requirements that they have) If you are in the market for a digital camera, consider the Sony and cut down on the wire mess on your pc.<br><br>
