            At the dealership, my wife and I saw the econo. version and if that's all they had to offer we would have left but fortunately the salesman had a short wheel base LS model that had not been sold due to it's colour (brown). We were able to cut a deal for the LS model (fully loaded) for a little more than the sticker price on the econo. model. 

We bought the Venture Van we love it! The Venture Van is one of the smoothes vehicles I've ever driven. It has guts on the freeway but the ride is quiet and comfortable. In the city you don't fell like your in a van. I was surprised by the tight turning circle. 

The interior is tops. A sound system with CD and no tape deck (who has tapes anymore?). The two integrated child car seats are a must because when you have kids, your friends have kids. 

What made the difference for me was the seven bucket seats and the power sliding door. Both of these were not available in my price range from any other dealership.
