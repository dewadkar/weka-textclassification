            Great car.

I got an Achieva S Coupe with the 2.3 litre 115 hp
inline four-cylinder engine mated to a 3-speed automatic. It is
pearl grey color with a dark gray cloth interior. 
It has power door locks which lock when the car is in gear.
Interesting feature is all Olds come with ABS. Nice.

Very good car mileage, got 36 highway.
About 23-25 about town.

Very comfortable seats, better then my 90 Camry
and 88 Accord.

I would recommend an Achievia to anyone.
It's got 91K miles. Don't know if I can get 200K.

Since these didn't sell that well, you can get a good deal on them.
Most people, like me, are blinded by Honda and Toyota.
You can't go wrong with a Haonda or Toyota, but the best deal is 
an Achievia. Save $.<br><br>
