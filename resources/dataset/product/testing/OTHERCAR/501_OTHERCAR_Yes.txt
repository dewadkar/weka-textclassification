            I love my Bonneville.  I drove my Grand Am for 8 years and loved it but I desperately needed a bigger, family-size car when our son was born.  My husband hated driving the Grand Am--it was &quot;too small&quot; for him.  I could not afford a new car, so I just started calling some dealerships, giving them my price range and what I was looking for.  The first guy told me, &quot;I have your car&quot;.  He did. The previous owner had bought it new from the dealership and kept it serviced there.  It is immaculate.

It is a black, 1994 Pontiac Bonneville.  It is great! It drives and handles wonderfully.  I thought it would be hard going to a bigger car, but after just a couple of times driving it, I didn't even notice the difference in size.  It is very roomy and comfortable.  My husband does not like to feel &quot;cramped&quot; when he is in a car.  This car has a lot of leg room as well as &quot;elbow&quot; room.  It has a HUGE trunk-a definite necessity with a baby.  When you go on a trip, you know you have to pack the house of course!   I am not very tall, but my seat will go up enough for me to drive comfortably.  I have leather seats which are really nice also.  Mine also has power seats-I really like that.  I have a CD player and it has always worked fine with no problems.  I guess the one negative would be that the gas mileage is not as good as my Grand Am, of course, but overall, it is decent enough.  I do mostly driving around town and a few longer trips during the week.  I usually fill up every 7-10 days. 

This is a great family size car that looks good too.  I love it when it is all cleaned up and shiny! :)  I wanted a nicer, newer, bigger car that was reasonably priced and this was the one I found.  I was not disappointed.  I would definitely recommend this car.<br><br>
