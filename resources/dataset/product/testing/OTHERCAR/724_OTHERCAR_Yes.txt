            It's sad, really; I couldn't find anywhere to post about my Talon when both vehicles are made in the same factory.  The only reason I chose the Eagle was the dealer made me feel like royalty, while the Mitsubishi people were so snotty to me they called me up and taunted me two days after I test-drove their car because I hadn't placed my order fast enough for them!

I wanted to comment on others' assessments of the various models of Eclipse as well as give my opinions on my car.  My neighbor bought a '97 Eclipse GS at the same time that I got my '97 Talon Tsi AWD.  He had the same problems other Mistubishi drivers have mentioned here, with it popping out of gear and, worse yet, the water leaks (his trunk was full of water).  I find stuff like that really disappoints me; shame on the manufacturer!

I have a sunroof and have no problems with any of the seals.  In fact, if I accidentally hit a window with a high-pressure hose while washing it, nothing leaks in.  I did have factory defects, though, and some of them were severe (a transmission seal!  A valve cover!  Replaced multiple times until I got non-defective parts!  Again, shame!).

If you can get past the bugs, this car is absolutely beautiful.  Once the initial factory defects were ironed out it has driven like a dream.  It handles like nothing on this earth.  The AWD package is more than worth it!  I will never drive a 2WD vehicle again.  This car is like a rocket that slingshots through curves and eats up pavement in a way that honestly rivals my previous car - an '87 Camaro with a 305 V8.  I've developed an annoying habit when someone tailgates me:  I speed up on a curve and watch them drop off in the distance with their eyes popping out of their heads.:-D  

If you don't mind a lot of gearwork and a drop in off-the-line acceleration, there's a very tolerant and willing 4-cylinder begging for you to kick in that smoothly-engaging turbocharger.  The clutch is very weird because it goes really deep, but fuzzy logic in the engine lets you break it in to a preferable range of foot movement.

When I first looked at the car, I thought, &quot;I'll never fit in that thing!&quot; (I'm 5'11&quot;) but that was when I discovered its secret:  lots of legroom.  An adult would be hard-pressed to sit behind me for long, but otherwise the back seat is also better than most.  In fact, I think the only problem with the back seat is the bench is too long and the foot room too short.  If they shortened the seat-cushion and applied that to the floor pan, you'd have a seat an adult could be comfortable in on short highway trips.  

Even though my heart was originally set on a Mustang, I bought this car because it was the most comfortable thing I have driven to date.  The ergonomics on the controls are well-placed (though some console buttons are hard to see around the steering wheel); they cater to the driver without making the passenger unable to touch the climate controls or the stereo.  And speaking of that, the Infinity Gold 8-speaker sound system is magnificent.  I am an audiophile now, and having that system has been one of my favorite add-ons to the driving experience.

As far as handling, a lot of people complain that the Eclipse/Talon are rough, and pick up every bump in the road.  I've discovered that if you tap 5lbs. off the tires you get a really smooth ride.  It's low to the ground, but not uncomfortably so.  The tail in the back (on the Talon it looks like a prop from the Jetsons) blocks some of the rear view, but you get used to it.  

Overall, the interior is decent but not overly roomy; the glove box is too small and the center console compartment doesn't add much.  The trunk is very deep (good for tall stuff) but not very long, so you do a lot of vertical lifting when you load/unload.

I haven't test-driven the new Eclipse body, but I don't need to; I like the look of this previous generation much better, and I want to see if I can keep this car long enough to give it to my daughter in 16 years - by then I'm sure it'll be a well-remembered classic.<br><br>
