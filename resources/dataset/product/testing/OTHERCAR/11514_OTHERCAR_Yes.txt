            When my wife and I were shopping for a new car, I had a few requirements. First, no mini-van or SUV. That said, we wanted a sedan, but I wanted it to have a sporty look, roomy interior including backseat legroom as my son is nearly 6 foot tall. Also, it had to be sporty looking, good performance and around $30K.

I spent a lot of time looking at reviews of different cars and then we settled on looking at 7 different cars. The 7 cars included Cadillac Catera (see my review on this car also on Epinions), Lincoln LS, Pontiac Bonneville, BMW 325i, Chrysler 300M, Infinity I30 and Maxima. After test-driving and pricing the above cars, we were set on two choices were the I30 and the Maxima. 

Our first choice was the I30 as the dealership was very convenient. However, being in the midwest, the winters and cold and the hot summers we didn't want leather seats. The I30 didn't offer anything but leather so we decided to look at the Maxima. Being sister cars they share many of the same features, including the same engine in the I30 and the Maxima 20th Anniversary Edition. The Maxima was also thousands of dollars less! The Infinity dealer didn't really want to deal, offering $1,500 off the $31,500 base sticker - that's no deal!


FIRST IMPRESSION
The base Maxima has decent looks, but the 20th Anniversary Edition really grabbed my eye. With its sunroof, spoiler, side flares, low profile tires and chrome spoke wheels, it truly (in my opinion), really dressed up the car. All of these features can be added as options to one or more of the base models. Some seem to find the Maxima styling bland. While it doesn't have the appeal of the more exotic looking cars, it's a nice look for a family sedan. The interior looked roomy enough and cloth seats available! The 20th Anniversary Edition also comes with 227hp engine compared with 222hp from the other models. The Infinity I30 also has 227hp, now sure how they squeeze the extra power out.


RIDE
The 20th Anniversary Edition is dressed up Sports Edition, that being said, I was expecting a rough ride. However, while the ride is slightly rougher than non-sport models, it's not really rough. If you want to experience a rough ride, check out the Catera from Cadillac (see my Epinion also on that car). The cornering in this car is very good, helped by the sports suspension and the low profile 17-inch tires. 


ROOMINESS
Headroom in front is very good, even with the sunroof. Rear headroom was average, providing enough room for me. Same to be said for legroom. The front provides more than ample legroom while still having plenty of legroom in the back. Compared to the other 6 cars we looked at, the Maxima (and sister car I30) provided the most head and legroom. The 300M had more overall spacious cabin. 


PERFORMANCE
Acceleration is very good, with power source providing 227hp. Merging into highway traffic is no problem, plenty of power and quick acceleration when the pedal is punched. Engine noise is very good and there is no noticeable transfer of engine vibration to the passenger compartment. I'd also rate road noise as very good even at highway speeds.


VALUE
We purchased this car for under $26K (sticker was almost $30K). This is lower than the pricing we were quoted on the other 5 cars. This was about $4K less than the Infinity, with about $1.5K difference due to cloth vs. leather, there were a few other minor toys that the I30 had the Maxima didn't. Still, hard to justify $2.5K difference for a few toys such as "memory seat settings" and "electronic rear sun shade". 

The Catera was over $30K and offered an inferior ride and performance, plus a trouble history. The BMW was also over $30K and had a TINY backseat. Ditto from the LS. The 300M was several thousand more as well and didn't have the "look" that we were looking for. 

For the money, we felt we got a great car for the price. The Maxima, based on the reviews I've read, has always been a very reliable car and the engine one of the best. We've only logged slightly more than 500 miles on it, but we've not found anything we didn't like.


CLOSING THOUGHTS
The car has been fun to drive. My wife drives it most of the time and this has been the first car we've had in a long time where she commented how much she likes the car. Gas mileage is hard to gauge as we've only filled up the tank once so far. With mostly local driving (we haven't had this beast out on the open road yet, sigh...), it averaged 18 MPG. This is in line with the EPA estimate of 19 MPG. Gasoline in our area (Chicago) is formulated to reduce pollution and as a result the MPG is always less than with standard gas blends (at least 2-3 MPG difference based on my experience while traveling in our other cars).

This is the first import that we've owned. We have always bought "American" (one of the big three). As you can tell from our car list above, we considered several different "American" models (can you really consider the Catera to be an "American" car since it's built in Germany? The Maxima though sold us on our first import.
