            We bought our Lincoln Continental in 1996 when it was two years old. Clearly, some of the best things about this car are the many luxuries and amenities it offers.  The leather seats, sunroof, and fully automatic seats are just a few of the goodies you'll find. 

It is the small things that I really found useful--by punching in your code into the door, keys are an option when you leave the car.  I don't like carrying a purse, so I often left the keys under the seat, locked the car, and was off. Another small but appreciated feature was the outside temperature button--I often checked the temperature before getting out of the car, which helped me decide whether a coat was necessary, for example.

This is a BIG car.  It handles well, without drifting all over the road like other large cars I've driven, although it doesn't &quot;hug&quot; the corners like smaller, sportier cars. The large front end did take some getting used to at first, especially when it came time to park--parallel or otherwise--but the roominess inside compensates for the small adjustments you must make to accommodate its size.

I do feel that the Continental is designed for a larger person than I am--I am 5'6&quot;, so I am not short, but I found that when I adjusted the seat to a comfortable position to reach the pedals, my knees were very close to the steering column. The car appears to be designed to accommodate those over 6 feet rather than those around my height (woe to the 5' tall woman who tries to drive this car!)

The other potential drawback is the possibility of major repairs after a few years.  This past year, the head cracked, and needed to be replaced.  This was a major expense, and one which I didn't feel a 6 year old car should typically experience.  Another friend, who had a car identical to this one, also experienced some major repairs after a few years.  If you are planning on keeping this car for a long time, this could be a serious issue.  In comparison, we have a 1989 Honda Accord (5 years older than the Lincoln) which has had NO major repairs.

Bottom line: The Continental is a beautiful, luxurious car, which will should give you several years of service.  But in my experience, trade it in before it's 5 years old to save yourself some headaches.<br><br>
