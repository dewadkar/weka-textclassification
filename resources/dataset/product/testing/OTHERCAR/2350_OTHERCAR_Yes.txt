            Well, first off, this was my first digital camera, but I had done extensive amounts of research on them before coming to my conclusion.  The main deciding factor was the price i was able to get it for off of Ebay.  Well, the first thing that caught my eye, was the nice size.  It is a nice travel companion.  The 2.1 megapixels also helped because i knew i didnt want to go below two and have only internet worthy pics, but I wanted some power.  I have taken this camera with me everywhere, and it has only failed me when i failed it (forgot to charge battery, wrong picture quality chosen)  The case is amazing.  I never would have thought that a company could make such a strong, metal, attractive case, and make it appealing to comsumers and professionals alike.  Because most digital cameras on the market now, will be made of pure weak plastic shells, and a good strong case is a thing to look for if you want the camera to last, and this one will!  With only one exception on my opinion, the jog dial... I had the camera in my pocket one day and i was on the tile floor, and i slipped and fell!  Good news, no broken circuitry, bad news, the jog dial fell off.  Nothing a little super glue and a fine-tuned eye couldnt fix (like 6 pieces were involved)  The most impressive aspects of this camera really got to shine when i was taking close ups (very good detail!) night shots with flash, and black and white (very crisp images)  One of the things i didnt like was the fact that there were no image settings like sepia, of negative, only black and white.  A very handy feature on this little guy is the half-touch focus. You push down the shutter button halfway and it auto focuses!  One of the things i didnt like, was the 16-frame movie mode.  It was useful on a rare occasion because it is basicaly taking 16 pictures them seaming them into one big picture, not in any movie format, just a colage.  If you do take that kind of a movie, you can watch it on the camera (no sound, jerky) but not on your computer.  The software features one very handy feature....QuickFix, this is a one click solution to unscrewing the pictures that the camera screwed up in quality.  Other than that on the software, i just use it to download the pics to the computer which is easy enough for me.  You can adjust the cameras bulb speeds, which i havent found handy yet, but yet is the key word.  I love the LCD display so much compared to all of the ones offered on sony models and so on, it is very crisp, bright and easy to read.  The LCD leads me to the battery life, which can be greatly reduced with the use of the LCD.  The battery just never seemed to pull throught when i needed it most, but hey, for what you can buy this camera for these days, you might as well get a better battery, right?  Since im not a professional photographer, and I dont get paid for the pictures i take, Me and the PDR-M4 are a perfect match, but hey, who says a pro could tell the difference, most can't.  Over all, this camera is a great buy, the only camera that i will warn you not to buy if your life depends on it, is a sony mavica with a floppy drive, they are fat, loud, too bright, horrible picture quality, heavy, yet people and schools still buy them, don't waste your money, go for the PDR-M4 it is worth every penny!
