            I know that most people just love theirs, so I'm sure I'm a minority of one when it comes to minivans....I hated mine!

In 1992 we purchased a used minivan that had less than 10,000 miles on it. According to our dealer, it had been a &quot;dealer vehicle&quot; and was an excellent buy. We thought a minivan would be the perfect addition to our family. After all, we already had the two growing kids who needed their own space while traveling, (does &quot;Mom, he's looking at me again&quot; sound familiar??) We also had a pop-up camper to pull, and lots of &quot;stuff&quot; to haul around such as bikes, camping gear and the neighbor kids. A minivan was just what we needed!!

I'm not sure at what point my &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship with my van began. It was possibly at the gas station when I had to fill that &quot;much larger than my little economy car&quot; gas tank. Another possibility is that it started from day one, when I pulled into the garage and realized that the side sliding door was on the opposite side of the garage as the entry door to the house. Groceries had to be loaded wwaaaayyyyyy in the back so I could open the back hatch to retrieve them. Ohhhh...and did I mention that every time the bag boy at the grocery store loaded my groceries, that back door slammed so loud and hard that the whole vehicle vibrated? 

Shortly after we purchased the van, we began to receive cards from the manufacturer, informing us that there was a &quot;defect&quot; with the model of van that we owned. We had it to the dealership more times than I can remember to fix a number of things,(for free, of course), including problems with the steering column and the safety latch on the rear door. But our biggest challenge with our van was yet to come.

Beginning in 1998, we noticed that the paint on our light blue van was beginning to bubble and chip. In a very short time the chipping so bad that the van was an embarrassment to drive. A local body shop owner told us that the basecoat that was applied to the van before the color was applied was defective (hmmm...I don't remember receiving a card on THAT defect). According to him, he had repainted many Voyager vans from the same year as ours and in most cases the manufacturer had paid for all or part of the repainting. My husband returned to the dealer where we purchased the van, armed with the facts given to him by 2 different body shops. He was referred to a district manufacturer rep that refused to admit that the paint job on our van was defective and denied our request to have it repainted at their expense. The dealership also refused to acknowledge any problem, and to be honest, they were very rude about the whole incident. We ended up trading in the van on a beautiful Olds Cutlass (I feel another review here &lt;grin&gt;). When the dealership heard through the grapevine that we were shopping for a new vehicle, they called to see if they could be of any help, and my husband politely told them that because of the way our van situation was handled, we would be shopping with another dealership.

I will have to admit that the van did have a few redeeming qualities. The kids loved having their own space to &quot;hang&quot; when we took road trips. For me, the best part was &quot;riding high&quot;. I am a short person and I loved driving through banks and fast food restaurants and being able to see eye-to-eye with the person in the window. It was the one time in my day when I wasn't looking up at someone.
