The main reason my wife and I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee was children.  Up until now we've been pretty much limited to Firebirds (1 Firebird, 1 Trans Am, 1 Grand Trans Am).  If you've ever tried to put a baby car seat in a firebird, it just doesn't work too great.  With the Jeep it's simple.

What I love about this vehicle:

1.  The ability to go anywhere!  It's the truth.  I tested it out thoroughly during the 1999/2000 winter season (I live near Cleveland, Ohio in the USA).  First I headed for parking lots full of snow piles created by snowplows, and drove straight through them.  It'd rip right through 2-3 foot deep snowdrifts with no hesitations at all!  Next I found two parking lots separated by an approximately 45 degree grade (the parking lots were about 4 feet away from each other, and there was about a 4 foot height difference between the two) covered with snow.  I gave it a little gas and it went down with no problem at all.  I then turn it around and climbed up the snow-covered grade, once again with no problems.  It was Awesome.  I feel very confident with its handling capabilities.

2.  Lots of room.  Room for three full sized adults in the back, plus a ton of room in the cargo area for groceries, camping equipment or other stuff.

3.  It's appearance.  This is kind of self-explanatory.

4.  It�s safe and comfortable. I saw on one web site where you�re six times more likely to survive a crash if your driving an SUV.

5.  Bells and whistles.  Every gadget you can imagine is here.  From heated sideview mirrors to an automatic rearview mirror that senses when someone�s headlights are shining in your eyes and angles itself to a better position.


What I dislike about this vehicle:

1.  The keyless entry system.  It's a joke.  The system uses infrared (instead of radio frequency like the 1996 and up models) to activate the locks and trunk release.  If any obstructions get between the transmitter and the receiver, it won't work.  The range is also very limited, like to about two or three feet (sometimes I have to place the transmitter directly against the driver's or passenger's front door window to get it to work).

2.  The absence of steering wheel mounted radio controls. This is just more of a nuisance than anything.  When you have the seat adjusted to an average position you can't reach the radio controls on the dash without leaning towards it, or slumping over in the seat.

3.  Scraping the windshield or washing the car.  Because of the cars height it's difficult to scrape ice off the front window, especially for women.  It is also hard to reach the top to wash or dry it.


What is it like to drive this vehicle?

Driving this vehicle is great experience, but it does not come cheap.  Gas mileage is poor, as with most 4x4s, and fuel cost increases with the optional V8 5.2 liter engine.  It cost about $26-30 (depending on gas prices) to fill the 22.5 gallon tank.  The overhead computer says my average gas mileage is 15.4 mpg.  The sound system is outstanding with an amp and EQ... it'll go as loud as you want with base that will thump your chest.  The supple leather seats cradle you and the ride is luxurious but still responsive enough to let you feel the road.

Buy this vehicle if...

1.  you want the ability to go anywhere.
2.  you want comfort and safety.
3.  you want bells and whistles.

Don't buy this vehicle if...

1.  you are looking for something economical (gas mileage)
2.  you are going to try and impress your friends with its keyless entry system.
