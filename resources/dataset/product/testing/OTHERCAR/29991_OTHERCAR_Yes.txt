            I recieved the crappy Kodak Digital Camera and Printer kit for christmas a couple of years ago.  They didn't work out and my old Vivital Digital Camera was in need of replacing. So I sold the old digital camera and took the crappy Kodak kit back to Walmart. 

I was still in need of a digital camera so I played with all the cameras on display then asked the guy in the photo department for his recommendation. He suggested the Canon Powershot.  It seemed easy enough to use in the store and came with a memory card.  Plus I already owned a Canon 35mm camera that I loved. So I bought the Canon Powershot camera.  

Details on Camera
1.3MegaPixel
3X Opital Zoom
8MB Memory Card 
Built in Flash


The PowerShot A10's design makes it almost impossible to take a bad shot. Easy to operate and small enough to fit into my backpack purse. 

I use the camera to take pictures of my stuff to list on ebay. Then tote it along to my best friend's little girls beauty pageants. The zoom comes in handy so I can stand behind the judges table and take pictures of her.  My fiance even quickly picked up on how to use pictures and takes pictures to send to his family in Utah. Everyone loves the quality of the pictures. I set the picture size to small on the camera and still turned out great pictures.

It does EAT regular batteries like candy so I went out and purchased a Rayovac charger and recharge battery kit. Plus one more set of extra rechargeable batteries to keep in the charger as a backup.  I upgraded to a 64MB memory card I got off ebay for $20.00 so I could have more pic room. Now the batteries die before I ever run out of room on the card.  

I have dropped this camera a few times and nothing has broke and it gets carried around in my backpack purse so the duribility is pretty good.  

The camera is hooked up to my HP computer that is running Windows XP. When I firsted plugged the camera up to the cable that is hooked to the computer it automatically recognized the camera and it prompted me to install the software that came on cd. The software was easy to install but after awhile I discovered I didn't use anything but the zoombrowser software that is used to view the pictures on the camera. I use the software that came with Windows to edit the pictures or Paint Shop Pro. I downloaded new drivers/software from Canon's website so I would have current software. Now when I startup the camera software it automatically pulls up the zoombrowser software so I can download the pictures to my computer. 

Now that I have owed this one for a couple of years I hope to be able to afford the A60 that is out on the market so I will have the newest version.  

I wanted to get my fiance a used A10 but even on Ebay they are selling for new prices.  So apparently this cameras have a great resell value even used.
