                 I bought my white 1993 Plymouth Sundance when I was fresh out of high school, and needed a reliable vehicle when I moved away from home.  After looking around at different car dealerships, the Sundance seemed like the best deal for the money.   I also thought it was pretty decent looking, and the power compared to its size was very appealing.  The car rides comfortably,   though it has somewhat of a low ceiling.  Little people like myself  (I'm 5' 2") have no problems at all, but my taller friends have bumped their heads while exiting the vehicle.  While they may not appreciate that feature, it gives me something to laugh at!

     It was hardly used, since the previous owner only had it for a year and a half. (bought new)  Everything on it was nearly perfect.   For as long as I've owned my Sundance, it only required any major work on it twice.  One was for the paint job.  After two years of ownership,  the paint on my car started chipping and peeling all at once.  

    The damage was due to the fact that I didn't have access to a garage for until just recently.  (After I moved out of my apartment and bought a house with a garage) Also, I have heard that the paint on all chrysler vehicles are notorious for peeling. I was able to use touch-up paint on the trouble spots.  Also, the outdoor exposure included the infamous Ice Storm of 1998.  The paint damage didn't become truly severe until after that winter.  Fortunately,  it was all just cosmetic. There was no rust and base coat was able to protect the metal. My only real gripe is the paint job itself.

    The only other time I had major work done on my car was a loose tie-rod end.  Even then, it wasn't a deal deal, and didn't cost too much to fix.  All other work on my Sundance is routine oil changes, and front end re-alignments. (which is necessary after driving on the very bumpy Maine roads!)    Most other small problems such as burnt-out tail-lights were either fixed by my dear old Dad or myself.

    I still own my Sundance, and will continue to drive it for as long as I can.  It's been good to me so far.  I think I got my money's worth out this vehicle.    Be warned, plan to shell out money for a paint job later on.  If you don't want to face that reality, then don't buy this vehicle.   

     My ex-fiance' drives a 1986 blue Dodge Shadow,
 which was manufactured around the same time. It's what you might call the fraternal twin to the Sundance.  The front & tail ends are slightly different, but both cars share many of the same interior parts.  He had to re-paint his car as well, but he has also made very few visits to the garage.  That's excellent, considering he is a procrastinator when it comes to taking care of his car.  (his oil changes are very few and far between!) 

     Overall,  the Sundance is a car you can rely on,  as long as you give attention to preventive care. With safety features such as a driver's side airbag and anti-lock brakes,  it would an excellent teenager's first car.   In addition,  replacement parts would be easy to find and relatively inexpensive to purchase, since they are common.    
However, I would not recommend it as a family car. It is quite an operation to hook up my niece's car seat in the back. I cannot imagine having to do that all the time!
