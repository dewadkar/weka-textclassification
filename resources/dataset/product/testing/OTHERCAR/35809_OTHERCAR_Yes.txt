            When I decided to look at a car I was told by a few of my friends that Saturn's were good. So I did some online research. Prices was
a large factor for the car. After looking at several web sites which included Mazda, Ford, GM and Honda I returned my attention to
to the Saturn web site. I got look at not only prices, but features, colors and styles. I loved playing around with all of the options and learning what I needed in a car. Once I have done my research on the web I decided to go to the local dealer. I was nervous walking, this was the first time that I had gone out seriously to look at any car, never mind a brand new one. I was greeted warmly
by the reception person. I had called ahead to make an appointment, I was to meet Ron. As I waited for Ron I began to look around the show room. As I did I immediately saw a car that seemed to have the same features that I wanted, it was a four door, green colored SL1. I casually looked it over. Then Ron appeared. He had a smile and his face and was friendly off the bat.  He sat my husband and I down to talk over what we were looking for in a car. After finding out our needs he asked if we wanted a test drive.
I figured why not. He pulled around a car that was the same color and make. The test drive was great. We even took the car on a dirt road, it handled extremely well and it was so quiet. I fell in love. All of the financing was down at the dealership and they even gave me a launch.

I tell you this story because I want you to think about the people that you deal with when you buy your next car do you want someone who will be honest with you, someone that you fell like you can trust. I know I sure did. And that is exactly what I got.
Not to mention I bought a car that seats four, has a large trunk, pull down back seats for those long items, and the car drives like a
little sports car. It is great for newly married couples who are hoping to start a family, but still want something that is fun, safe and gets amazing gas mileage.

Take a test drive and see for your self.<br><br>
