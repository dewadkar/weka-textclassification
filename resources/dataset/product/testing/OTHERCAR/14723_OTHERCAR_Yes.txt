            First let me say that it is unusual for me to purchase &quot;cutting edge technology&quot;.  I am usually the one who sits back and waits for something to become a &quot;proven&quot; product and common place enough for the price to drop considerably.  Circumstances allowed me to take a gamble and purchase the Yashica Samurai.  Not really having a clue as what to expect, I anxiously awaited my purchase.  The day the UPS man delivered my digital camera to my door was the beginning of a wonderful excursion into the world of digital photography. Upon opening the box I was first amazed at the compact size and light weight of this item.  As I began stumbling through the unknown frontier of this new technology I became more and more excited with my findings.  Everything I had read regarding digital photography had terrified me about making such and investment.  Now I was in the position to discern the rumor from fact.  

1)     Battery consumption - Many online reviews had let me to believe that digital cameras ate batteries like candy.  Not so with this model. One of the distinct advantages to this particular model is the rechargeable battery pack.  I have not noticed and more &quot;battery usage&quot; than most electronic items.

2) Resolution -  Most online reviews portray digital photography as fine for small photos but lacking the resolution to print large pictures. The first test I made of the Yashica Samurai was to take a photo with low color concentration and view it on my 60&quot; big screen television.  Using normal resolution to take the photo and even after using the zoom feature there was no distortion even at 60&quot;.  This camera has the option to increase resolution to &quot;super fine&quot; also.  Although, I had not found the need for the super fine as the normal creates photos capable of being printed at 8&quot; by &quot;10 without any grainy effect.

3) Cost Prohibitive - Realizing that the digital cameras with mega pixel resolution are a costly purchase it is easy to justify the expense.  Using just the 8 meg compact flash card that comes with this camera you can use the normal resolution and save 58 photos on the card. Now that would be the equivalent of 2 rolls of film. Now the cost of the film and the developing alone would be in excess of $50.00. Then you have batteries, let's assume batteries for the standard camera would cost $5.00. Now, once you download the photos you can erase the card and start over and just recharge the camera.  So if you shoot on average 20 rolls of film in a year the camera would have paid for itself.  Every picture from that point on would be free.  So the initial investment may be large but it is extremely cost efficient.

I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone who wants great pictures and knows the value of a dollar.
