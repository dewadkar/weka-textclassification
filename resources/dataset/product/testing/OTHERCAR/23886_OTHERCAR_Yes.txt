            Bought '95 S model in 1997 for $17,000 (about half of MSRP at that time) with 50K miles. Now has 85K+ and no major problems altho 60K maintenance was expensive (slightly over $1100). Purchased the car because of its styling, performance, and  great price used. Since I live at 4,300 ft. elevation (SLC) wanted a car that maintained its cited performance at that altitude and I haven't been disappointed by the Millenia. Ride quality, noise, comfort have been addressed by others and I agree that they are &quot;near luxury car&quot; and obtainable at a significantly lower price (if car is bought used anyway) than other comparable models. 
But, my particular love of the car is in its performance. The supercharged Miller Cycle engine is a joy to listen to. Unlike a Lexus ES300, you can hear the sweet sounding Millenia building up its power and the &quot;OOMPH&quot; comes on a great deal sooner in the rev range(compared to other Japanese V-6s)due to the supercharger. Feels like a V-8 instead of a small V-6. And extremely smooth throughout its RPM range. Top speed?
(Please save your keystrokes about what I am to describe if you want to warn me about the foolishness, danger, unlawfulness, etc. I am sharing my experience so that others might get a feeling for what a great car the  Millenia S model is.) Last month, east of Winnemucca, NV on I-80 I finally was able to open the S model up and see if it truly would go 145 MPH as listed in the dealer's brochure. My particular car couldn't reach 145 MPH but with 80K plus on the odometer it did settle in at 141 MPH and handle quite nicely at that speed. (Clear view ahead, daylight, dry and straight freeway, only passed three other vehicles and I had earlier checked the speedometer accuracy at 100MPH and it was dead on; 36 sec/mile). Since the car came with a rear air foil (I like the looks but it probably adversely affects the low coefficient of drag that Mazda designed into this model), figured that the factory was truthful about the top speed. 
Excellent snow country car. ABS, traction control, able to start out in second gear, heated seats, mirrors (last two available with cold weather package option) If you like performance, comfortable and mostly quiet ride (coarse pavement noise can invade cabin), luxury for less money, and understated styling, definitely look into buying a Millenia S model. <br><br>
