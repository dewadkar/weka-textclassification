            I purchased my Durango back in early November and I'll tell you this, it was truly worth every penny. The Durango gives me the best of both the offroad and the urban worlds. Having the 4x4 SLT gives me all the ruggedness i need for the dirt roads and all the rough riding that i do. The compact size, while being very generous on the inside, is perfect for city life. The Durango is also a very nice looking truck too, which in my case style is very important.
The easily foldable seating allows me to store my mountain bike and riding equipment with no fuss, and it is also great for when my friends or family ask me to help them move.
I have been thoroughly impressed by its handling both on paved streets and on the back-roads. Unlike the 4-runner that i sold off, the Durango seems to center very well in turns and taking obstacles.
