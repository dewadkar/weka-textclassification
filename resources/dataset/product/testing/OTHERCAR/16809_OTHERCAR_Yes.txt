            I've always wanted a convertible ever since I was 16.  I pulled into the dealership with no intention what-so-ever to purchase a car.  The convertible caught my eye immediately and I was drawn to it to take a look.  The overall look of the car speaks for itself.  The newly redesigned front fascia gives the Camaro the well deserved aggressive look of an American muscle car.  I love the layout of the interior and the easy access of all the controls.  The only matter of concern is the back seat.  I advise anyone with children to reconsider trying to put a carseat in the rear.  Not only is there not enough room, but the shape of the seat makes it almost impossible to install the carseat properly.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a sporty car that looks, performs, and handles like a sports car should.  <br><br>
