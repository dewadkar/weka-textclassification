            What does a family of seven drive on long trips?  The Chevy Suburban is a god-send.  This truck has all the room you'll ever need and the interior is designed for comfort and convenience.  Even with all seats occupied, you can still fit the week's groceries, the dry cleaning and the family dog in the rear cargo bay (we've done it!).

The Suburban ranges 10-14 mpg city and 16-20 mpg hwy.  I extended my gas mileage by 3 mpg just by using Mobil 1 (0 weight) synthetic oil.  The 37 gallon tank makes for long stretches between fill-ups, but refill your bank account before you fill-up your gas tank.  I figure on $45 per fill-up every 600 miles or so... thank goodness it can take regular unleaded.

I have the front bucket seats with leather interior.  The comfort of the seats is as good as any Cadillac I have driven.  Two zone heating and cooling with switchable Rear Control offers quick cooling/heating throughout the vehicle.  Cup holders for everyone and even two extra; map/magazine nets behind both front seats; and gadget/toy wells next the rear seat on both sides.

The handling is better than any pick-up as the Suburban really has some mass to it.  The GM 4WD can be hard to handle when weather or terrain does not dictate; the optional 4WD on demand feature is a must.  Pick-up is not a problem for this beast; just make sure noone is in front of you when you punch it... it will giddyup and go!

I highly recommend that you use Rain-X or similar glass coating on the windows.  This especially comes in handy for the barn door windows in the rear which are prone to muddying in drizzle or lightly wet road conditions.

All-in-all, I look forward to driving mine a million miles!
