            Since we have a unique situation and need 5 car seats the Chevy Venture Extended version was the perfect vehicle!  We needed a van and even though we really need the roominess of a conversion van I find them very hard to drive and park.  We looked at just about every minivan out there and fell in love with the Chevy Venture!  This minivan works perfect for us because it can safely handle 5 car seats.  We purchased a 7 passenger van with 3 seats in the second row and 2 bucket seats in the rear.  This allowed us to put the triplets car seats facing backward in the center for easier access.  We put the twins car seats in the rear seats.  The extended version allows us to get BOTH the Peg Perego triple stroller and the Graco side by side twin stroller behind the rear seat (which is a must!!!).  I would highly recommend this minivan to any family with multiples. 

Other wonderful features are dual sliding doors, flip and fold removable seats which allows for versatility.  Rear air keeps the children comfortable.  The overhead console allows you to store sunglasses and your garage door opener in arms reach.  There is also a drawer hidden underneath the passenger front seat.  An extra adaptor for a cell phone comes in handy.   <br><br>
