            Rationale for Purchase:
With a family of six (four kids 9 to 14 and two adults) there is very little choice for a family vehicle other than to go with a Minivan.

In June of 1999 we purchased a Dodge Grand Caravan SE, with a few options. The reason this was important is that we were going to drive from Mississauga, Ontario to Halifax, Nova Scotia. This is a journey of some 4,000 kms.

Experience:
We owned a 1984 Plymouth Voyager LE until it died last year, and this had been a reliable people carrier, up until it started showing its age (15 years, 250,000 km).

With the new 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan, the only problems we have experienced are the replacement of one rear brake-light bulb soon after receiving the vehicle, and a faulty switch in the passenger middle door, which would cause the power doors to lock and unlock as we were driving.

Both of these minor problems were repaired under warranty and without cost.

The seating configuration is quad captains chairs, 2,2,3 and this works out well for the kids as it separates them. 

Driving:
I love driving and the long journeys with the family are great. The kids are comfortable, awake or sleeping, and they complain very little.

The Grand Caravan is a worthwhile investment as the extra length comes in very useful for carrying suitcases, camping equipment or various other family junk.

The vehicle has the 3.8 liter engine which provides good acceleration even when heavily loaded. The only drawback is the fuel consumption; my wife drives alot of short journeys in the area and gets about 20 miles to the gallon. On longer journeys this can go up to 28 mpg when you are cruising all day.

We had test driven many of the competitor offerings, but when it came down to the buying decision, my wife preferred the Dodge Grand Caravan (this is someone who used to drive a Mini in England). The vehicle handles very well, particularly for its size and is easy to park.

Overall:
Both my wife and myself love driving this vehicle and the kids love the van as well. We would definitely buy the same again.
