            Nissan knows how to appeal to the young, hip crowd of generation X.  Its engineers based their design on the 2000 model which has been a hot item so far.  They only had to improve it just a little and add a few extras to it.  The Nissan Co. knows how to make a few good moves on the competitors.  At a time when a lot of bulky, limousine-like vehicles are passing for SUVs, Nissan came up with Xterra.  It has not stopped making people turn their heads or cast a few curious glances.  When I test-drove this jewel of a vehicle, I found a lot of points you will be interested in knowing if you want to purchase one.

<b>Nissan Co. continues to surprise competitors and customers with 2001 Nissan Xtera.</b>

About a year before this small SUV appeared on the market, I read about it in some spy car magazines.  (the kind of magazines where photographers hide in the bush or get perched on trees to take some shots when they are being tested in various landscapes...) From the moment I saw the pic, I recognized that it would be designed and priced to attract the young buyers.  Well, mature buyers who want to live their youthfulness once again can purchase it too.  <i>This is where the 2001 Nissan Xterra is poised to go head to head with competitors such as Jeep Cherokee, Isuzu Rodeo and Honda Passport.</i>

<b>2001 holds its own as an SUV</b>

The 4-foor, five passenger, midsize sport utility is a definite head-turner on the Bay Area and Central Valley roads and freeways.  In fact, even the worst, out-of-shape guy who is driving it may feel an air of superiority on the road.  It provides him with comfort in that he knows that he is maneuvering some steel, muscle vehicle.  Personally, I have been in love with the platform on which Nissan Frontier is built.  Nissan Xtera is built on th same one.  It's a 2.4 liter, 4-cylinder engine with 143 horsepower and 154 foot-pounds of torque.  

<b>Standard equipment and features</b>
5-speed manual transmission, air conditioning, anti-lick brakes, power steering, brakes, AM/FM, rear window defroster, rear-seat heater ducts. On the way back from Los Banos, I let my wife drive the Eterra and sat in the back seat with my son.  Being a tall guy, I was surprised to find out that I had enough leg room in the back.  I also had enough head room despite the crooked top you may have noticed.  Actually, the rear seats are somewhat elevated to allow you and your company sitting the back some fantastic view.  Now you can see why the roof steps up over part of the rear of the truck.  <i>By looking at the rugged exterior of the SUV, you would think that it is difficult to drive, but actually the steering is very smooth.  It rides just like any regular car.</i>  

<b>Some of the new options in 2001 Nissan Xterra are:</b>

T-lamp grill guard, in-cabin microfilter, auto-dimming.  You can find the exterior colors in Blue, Gold Rush, Khaki, mineral Blue.

By the way, if you are a skier, a surfer, a bicyclist or practicing a sport that requires to carry equipment, the 2001 Nissan Xterra is for you.  You will fall in love with its rails which you can use to tie, strap your tools and equipment.  If you go to Santa Barbara, Pismo Beach or any others for that matter, you can see these vehicles loaded with gear.

If you want to impress a man or a woman this holiday season, 2001 Nissan Xterra is a great present idea.  Well, your spouse will be glad and feel better knowing that you are driving up and down the roads in one of these Xterras.  It can definitely be a family vehicle!
