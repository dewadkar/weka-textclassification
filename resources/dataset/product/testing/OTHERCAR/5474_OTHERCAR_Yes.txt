            The main reason I bought the prizm is its good price and quality.  Knowing that the car is almost identical to a Toyota Corrola, I was sure that the car is of great quality, requiring very low maintenance.  The car is very efficient in gas usage -- 37 miles per gallon on Freeway.  The manual shift works smoothly, much smoother than the Suzuki Tracker.  The engine is a little small, but having 118 horsepower, I can achieve pretty good acceleration with the manual shift.  The interior is cozy.  Five people can fit in comfortably.  There is also a quite big trunk suitable for everyday shopping.  The shortcoming is that the sound proof isn't optimal.  Although the engine is quiet, but when you run it at 75 mph, the noise from the ground and the air is pretty big.  If you are looking for a low maintenance, high fuel efficiency, low-lasting compact car, and you are not fervent about turbo acceleration, the Prizm is definitely a excellent choice.<br><br>
