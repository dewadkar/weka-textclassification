              I would highly recommend the Infiniti I30 to someone looking for a four-door luxury sedan.  The engine is one of the best V6 engines on the market and I have heard that they have increased the horsepower in their new 2000 models (I have the 1999 model and the engine in that model has quick pick-up and more than enough power for me). The I30 has been ranked very highly by some of the consumer magazines, as well, in terms of reliability and consumer happiness - this was definitely a big factor for me in buying the car. 
  The I30 has a roomy interior that insulates well from outside road noise and seems to have larger cabin space than some of its competitors, such as the BMW 5 series.  I drive a lot for work and the comfortable, adjustable seats make driving long distances a pleasure - no more leg cramps from an uncomfortable seat or numb arms from a steering wheel that shakes when you travel above 60 mph on the freeway. An added bonus on my model was a GPS Navigation system that has come in extremely handy when I am lost - it has been an invaluable addition and I no longer have to have a glove box filled with cumbersome maps.  It was thrown in for free on the model I bought - I think the normal cost of this add-on is in the $2000 range, but I would highly recommend it.
  One of the main reasons I purchased the I30 was that it gave me all I wanted in a car - good engine, reliability, safety features (incl side air bags), roomy cabin, and comfort - in a sleek design and for a very reasonable price.  I paid under $30,000 for mine and, after looking at some of the luxury car competitors, don't think you can get more car for less money out there.
   The only downsides about the car are that, since it is a &quot;luxury&quot; car, the costs of maintenance and routine tune-ups are costly.  The average price for a routine tune-up/ maintenance check runs $500-$600.  <br><br>
