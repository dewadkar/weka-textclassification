            OK, some honest disclosure, up front. I'm 6-feet tall and weigh north of 200 pounds. I am not as limber as I used to be.

Every time I get in this thing, I bump my head on the roof. Not a good frame of mind, eh?

This car is my wife's play-thing. She loves it, so who cares? Well, I do. 

Mercedes took the engine out of the E-class and stuffed it into this little (and I do mean LITTLE car). The result is plenty of power, but no finesse. If you have a heavy right foot and don't pay attention, this car can get away from you.

The Mercedes fit and finish that I had grown accustomed to in two previous Mercedes is absent in this car. Materials are cheaper. Build quality, not quite as good. I suspect that Mercedes deliberately dumbed down this car so as not to cannabalize sales of the costlier (and aging) SL.

The seats are awful. No lumbar support. When the doors close, there's no "thud".

On the plus side, the steel top folds nicely into the trunk in about 25 seconds. And with the top down, my claustrophobia melts away.

But unless you place a high premium on "being seen" in an admittedly attractive car, the lack of creature comforts will drive you crazy.
