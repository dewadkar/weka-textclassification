            I have owned an Acura Integra LS for over four years and I have never been disappointed.  Sporty and with plenty of power, this is a reasonably priced and highly reliable sports car.  Both of the Integras I've owned (lost one in a wreck...more on that later) have handled well, have plenty of power (with a manual transmission), and look great.  They get high marks from Consumer Reports for reliability, are well built, and they hold resale value very well.  

I first owned a 1992 LS, I bought it used and drove it for a bit more than a year.  One day, my wife and I were hit head-on at 40 miles-per-hour by a driver who had illegally crossed the center line.  We sustained minor injuries, though the doctor told me that, at that speed, we should be dead.  Credit Acura crumple zones which worked perfectly, and some strong seatbelts, for saving our lives!  Once the insurance was settled, I set out to get another Acura.  

I bought a 1995 LS three years ago and it served me well for three years.  Other than routine maintenance, I had no problems with it at all.  It looked and drove even better than the 1992 model, plus it was even more safe as it was equipped with airbags.  I recently sold it and couldn't believe how &quot;in-demand&quot; the car was.  I got a great price and sold it quickly.

As we now have a child, we needed a larger car and there are very few Integra Sedans on the used-car market.  Unfortunately, they were hard to find and also a bit small for a family, and we ended up buying a 1999 Toyota Camry.  

If you are looking for a sporty car that is fun to drive and doesn't enjoy visits to the mechanic, the Acura Integra LS is the way to go.  A tremendous value in the wallet and on the street, I can't say enough about it.<br><br>
