            Now, there are many other cars that compete with this car, most notably the Acura RL and Lexus LS. But both cars pale in comparison to the luxuriousness of the Q45. With tasteful touches of chrome, glove soft leather, gadgets galore, brilliant Bose sound system and enough wood to make the Sierra Club weep, this car dazzles! 

Nissan, the parent company of Infiniti, is known for making extremely reliable cars with virtually "bullet-proof" transmissions and there is no doubt that this definitely extends to their Infiniti line. The car has been nothing but a joy to drive with hundreds of TROUBLE-FREE miles; only thing I've had done were the requisite oil changes. I don't forsee any major issues coming up either, especially when I know other Q45 owners who have driven theirs Qs for years.

The Q45 I have is a touring edition and so it handles a better and rides more firmly than regular Q45. It's no BMW 540i but that makes no difference to me because if you want a sports car, you buy a sports car. The handle is precise and steering wheel is completely isolated from the road so you get a just enough road feel to still feel like you're part of the driving experience. The LS400 is just too isolated from the road but the Q45 is more sporting. Infiniti is to Lexus what BMW is to Mercedes: one company is more performance oriented and the other more sedate.

The interior is a joy to be in. The seats are comfortable and supple to the touch, but not very supportive in spirited cornering (grin). All the controls are easy to reach and easy to use. The whole interior from the doors to the rear seat vents are covered in bird's eye maple. The door handles are chrome (not plated) and blend well with everything. The sound system is a 200-watt, 8-speaker monster that is superb! The bass is good and can get very heavy, if you turn it up, but the mids and highs aren't washed out by it. 

All in all, it's a wonderful car that will have you thinking of places to go just to drive it. I've gotten many compliments, from friends and strangers alike, on it and I don't intend to give it up any time soon.
