            When making the decision to spend the money to have the luxury that you want it is important to look at the most minute of details.  The fit and finish of a BMW 7 series is in my opinion the best example of luxury available for less than 100k.  From the rear sunshades that you pull up and lock. To the spring loaded ash-tray covers this car has no other rivals.  The electronic 12 way seats have enough side bolstering to hold you gently while you use all of the available power that comes from the smooth and silky BMW V-8 (or 12 if you opted for the 750).  As for the driver comfort the seat offers you more than enough back support while at the same time letting you relax in the fine comforts of the clean and tight lines of the cabin.  The passengers have more than their share of room as well especially in the L models, with the extra length it really does not matter who is in front of you there is a ridiculous amount of space to be had with the small footrests at your feet keeping you all the more comfortable at all times.  The optional audio system with the GPS navigation is a must.  To truly enjoy something like the experience of driving this car you must also have the soundtrack to accompany your adventure.  The highs mids and lows are all accurately reproduced with an ability to make you feel the performance as if you were there.  The DSP also allows you to fine tune your sound.  One thing that I appreciate most is the on board computer that will beep at me when I have let my foot come to far down on the accelerator.  The performance of this car gets you excited about driving and life and keeps you there.  The suspension while soft and gentle is also tight allowing you to drive it like the BMW that it is.  The motor provides silky thrust all the way through the power band and keeps you running around all the annoying Honda Civic drivers.  The trunk is a cavern and will hold three golf bags running in a fashion parallel to the car conveniently leaving room for whatever else you might be carrying on you trip.
