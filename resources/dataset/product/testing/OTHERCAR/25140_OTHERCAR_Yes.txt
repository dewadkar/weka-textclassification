            I confess, I hate cameras.  I hate lugging around the bulky things, plus case, plus film, plus spare lens, plus spare battery, plus lens caps.  I hate how the size of them basically ruins my participation in events and relegates me to an observer.  I hate having to pay to develop film.

Thanks to the S110, I'm out of excuses.  The camera has the surface area of a credit card.  It easily fits in to a shirt or pants pocket, even with the optional case.  I don't mind carrying this around, I'm no longer a party pariah.  It's made out metal and feels sturdy, unlike the Sony DSC-P1 which felt plasticky and fragile.  The resolution is only 2.1 megapixels, but that's more than sufficient for my needs.  I'm not Ansel Adams, so I don't need 10 megapixel resolution to print out posters.

The color reproduction on this camera is excellent compared to others, especially the Sony DSC-P1.  The LCD is good and responsive.  The movie mode is a neat feature, though not one I use much.

Max resolution is 1600 x 1200 I believe.  In addition to the movie mode, there is a black and white mode, timer, multi-shot mode, stitch, and many more features than I have occasion to use.

The included software is adequate for normal retouching.

The camera comes with an 8MB Compact Flash memory card which is sorely inadequate.  I am using a 128MB card now and find that its storage capacity more than generous.

The camera also comes with a USB cable and a battery charger.  Additional cost options include an A/C adapter, and carrying case.

The flash is somewhat weak, but this seems chronic to digital cameras as a category.  

The selling point for me was the size.  No matter how good a camera is in every other category, I won't carry it (and thus can't use it) unless its not a burden.  The size and package gets an A+, all other features get a B+, making it a very attractive product.

Once you get the camera, spend the $15 for the nifty suede fitted case.  Unlike generic black cases, it fits the camera well enough to retain the size while providing a place for extras.
