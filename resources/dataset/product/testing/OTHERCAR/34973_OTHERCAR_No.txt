             This past week I took a small unexpected &quot;vacation&quot;
to California to attend a funeral.  What i ended up
renting was a 2000 Grand Prix.  After going to budget,
and several other rental places, Avis was the only 
renter that had an available vehicle.
  The ride was superb for this vehicle...more than i 
expected.  The exterior styling was pleasant, and true
was the interior.  The front seats were firm, and
adjusted just the way i was used to.  Gauges were easy
to read, in the unfortunate color of orange.  A color 
that tends to be distracting while night driving.  In
one week i drove this car nearly 1000 miles and found 
a couple disturbing features.  
   First was a large bump in the middle of the back
seat where the &quot;5th&quot; passenger would have sat.  This lump
was so hard, we only toted 4 passengers.  Not a single
person would sit in the middle of the back seat.  It 
would be like sitting on a cantaloupe.
   Second was the cluster of gauges on the steering wheel
that controlled the cruise control.  The plastic surrounding
these buttons was very sharp and i found my self scraping
my hands many times.  I learned quickly not to put my hand
at the bottom of the steering wheel.
   Third was road and engine noise.  The engine was very noisy
and the car was always followed by whistling and howling. 
   Last was  the acceleration.  I doubt the engine in 
this vehicle was top of the line for the grand prix, but 
the gas pedal was...mushy.  It took a bit of pressing on the pedal to get
the car to move.  This i found hard to get used to. 
   For the money i spent on it as being a rental, the car
came with ample luxuries, and it suited its purpose.
