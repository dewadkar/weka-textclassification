            I bought this truck brand new in 1997.
It was a brand new &quot;Silverado&quot; with everything offered, except leather seats.

I've finally gotten rid of it - and there were less than 34,000 miles on it!!

I went trough 4 differentials - (big pumpkins on the axle).  For some reason, this POS couldn't seem to hold it's fluid (no, it wasn't leaking through the vent hole...).  On the third RE-BUILD of the differential (GM was too cheap to get me another one, until it had become defective &quot;at least&quot; 3 times in one year...), I also had to get all my brakes replaced.  Why?  My differential had gotten SO HOT, it literally shattered my back brake shoes.  Now, my truck was only using it's front brakes to stop (small safety hazard).  Luckily, I had &quot;felt&quot; this and caught it within the first week I realized &quot;I have no back brakes!&quot;

This wore down the front brakes prematurely.  GM wouldn't cover this under warranty.... which cost me approximately $150 (so much for &quot;3 year/36,000 mile warranty).  Then, I had to shell out over $150 for the rental truck needed for the 3 days the dealership had my truck ($25 alloted by GM will not by you &quot;jack squat&quot; as far as rental vehicles go).

Add to this needing new tires after only 3,000 miles (Uniroyal Tiger Paws aren't worth squat, either).
Also, with my bad differential (and/or axle), I could barely keep the rear end of this POS on the road...  To get any descent traction, I had to drive around with 300 lbs. of sandbags in the bed!

Did I even mention my &quot;power steering control module&quot; went out after 1.5 years?  What's scary is when I called the dealership about it, they literally said &quot;Yeah, we know what that is.  We've been seeing about 20-30 of these a week.  GM redesigned the part, so bring it on in...&quot;

The only saving grace I could give this truck is that the 5.7 Liter Vortec was fast... but I could barely tell this because I could hardly ever keep the rear end on the ground to get any traction...

I will NEVER by another GM product again (I've also had two Cutlass').<br><br>
