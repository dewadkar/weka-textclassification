            1999 Kia Sephia

The Kia Sephia is a nice little car. It is not uncomfortable on long trips, as some small cars tend to beat you to death. We needed a car that was good on gas and comfortable. 

However what we have found owning a Kia Sephia might be something to consider for others. 
In cold weather in the teens and twenties it will take it ten to fifteen minutes to warm. This might not be important I thought I'd mention it.
 
Heater: It is very good but the option of directing the heat to the floor is very, very poor. We took a close look and found while there was heat coming from the vent it was going across the bottom of the dashboard and disappearing, thus not reaching the floor. 

Venting:  There's not a off to the venting. You can turn it off the fan however there is still air coming from the vents. This makes it rather uncomfortable in the summer or winter when you want no response from the unit. In the summer it is a must to use the air conditioner to off set the hot air coming through. This is not fuel-efficient, you use more gas and it is noticeable.  The air conditioning is great but in view of the above it's a constant fuss to keep a happy medium. 

Minor details:
The engine noise can be rather loud. We are still not use to hearing the engine and wonder sometimes if we are in top gear or need to shift. 

The woven cloth seat covers are nice and durable but the weave catches your hair and pulls and snaps your hair ends off. 

The water dogs for the windshield work well however the design of the car, should you use too much spray ends up on your side window or on you if your window is down. Instead of being whipped away it follows the curve and into the car/window
