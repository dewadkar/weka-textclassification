            When I was growing up in Southern California, I noticed a lot of Volvos everywhere I went.  At the beaches, in the desert or up in the snow.  People who owned these cars seemed to like to have fun and the car of choice was the Volvo, which was known for it's durability, safety and comfort.  It was also said to be ugly and boxy but it looked ok to me. My sister owned one and after her experience with it, my parents decided to buy not one but four more Volvos!  The third and fourth Volvos were the 240 series sedans.  The first one used and the other new.  They were comfortable and looked like other more streamlined cars found on the market.

   I enjoyed the sunroof and the electric everything. I also liked the Volvo comfort - legroom, headroom, adjustable seats, (after all, I am six foot one and need to fit in a car to drive it), cruise control, power steering/brakes made it easy to drive on long trips.
It had power too!  On the open highway it hauled a___s.
However, I found this model of Volvo not as durable as the older ones I was used to.  The fan quit and the repair bill was outrageous! then a lot of little plastic parts started to break off and it became clear that these parts were not cheap to replace if even they could be found at all.
Several components started to fail as follow;
The fuel pump failed
The ignition computer failed
Fuses corroded and failed
Air conditioning failed
Sunroof leaked when it rained
door handle came off
body dented easily in parking lots
camshaft failed in both cars and had to be replaced

After several very expensive repair bills, both 240s were traded in for a new Toyota Camry and a Mazda.
Although we had problems with our 240s, I have seen others on the road and spoke to the owners who liked what they had. I also noticed they were mostly families with children and a dog. I guess they did not drive theirs as hard as mine... I would recommend only the basic model station wagon for its usefulness and comfort.<br><br>
