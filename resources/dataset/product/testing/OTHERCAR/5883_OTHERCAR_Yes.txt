            I wanted this thing ever since it came out in 1994- It's looks can hardly be improved upon. When the Quad Cab was introduced in 1998, I had to have it. My wife and I anticipated buying a boat and camper and finally enjoying the outdoor life..BUT I got accepted to Grad school, boat and camper were postponed, and the HUGE Ram became nothing but a daily commuter, something it is ill suited for.

The handling is ponderous at best {compared to the cars I'd been driving all my life}, the sheer bulk makes changing lanes in traffic something you have to plan well in advance, and 13 miles a gallon makes you forget how much you originally loved the deep burble of that big V8.

The Ram had 35000 miles on it when I traded it in for a practical economy car..It was totally reliable, had a great, compliant, well-damped ride and was the quietest vehicle I'd ever owned. The seats, driving position, and interior design were all exceptional. Its just too big and heavy and impractical unless you really need a truck.<br><br>
