            ***just an update to this opinion*****

Yesterday at 43800 miles my 1998 Dodge ram conversion van that transmission went out.  I contacted Chrysler and all they said was it isn't under warrantee anymore and the dealership wants over $2000 to fix it.   Think hard before buying one of these.




I bought a Dodge Ram Conversion Van 1500 short wheel base on October 31, 1998.  This was the worst mistake I could have ever made!  Not only did I have problems with the vehicle, but also the dealership where I bought the vehicle - MONROE DODGE OF MICHIGAN - was the worst dealership in handling this account.  All accounts in this are accurate and are verifiable thru Chrysler complaint line.  The day after I bought my brand new van - which only had 180 miles on it (conversion vans have more miles because they are driven to the conversion site) the anti-lock brake light on the dash came on. 

I looked in my service manual to see what I should do and it said - do not drive - return to dealership for immediate repair.  The next day we took our vehicle back to the dealership and they (after leaving us an an hour in the waiting room) told us they would have to keep the vehicle for examination (which meant they didn't know what was wrong with it) and they gave us a dodge Stratus as a rental car.

After two days with the rental car we find out that there has been a recall on the rental car on the parking brake.  The problem is that it rolls when on inclines (which of course our driveway was).  We called the dealer and they told us quote "don't park it on an incline".  

We then contacted Chrysler to open a complaint file....it took them 7 days to replace an AB Module in our car.   We then thought we'll we have our vehicle back and we returned the faulty rental car and were on our way - -  when on the way home the brakes start to pull to the left side.  We thought 'well maybe it is working out an air bubble' - right.  We were afraid to take it back to the dealership because of the last time but after talking with Chrysler and other dealers they said we had to.

This time the dealership had our vehicle for 27 DAYS!!!  The problem you ask?  A pinched brake line!!!!!  .....Probably something they did when they changed the AB Module.

Since then, we have had two other problems with the brakes needing to be replaced and the rotors turned and I am not convinced the problem is actually fixed.  My main complaint is that I am driving a vehicle with rotors turned to specs and it is almost out of warranty.  I feel that this van has brake problems yet (still pulls to the left) (which the dealership tells me is normal!) and Chrysler did not stand behind us the consumer but the dealership.  I will never buy a Dodge again or any other Chrysler product.
