            We bought our Alero in January of 1999.  Other than routine oil changes, the only repair necessary was a taillight that had to be replaced. I drive the car every weekday to work and home, occasionally on the freeway, but mostly at 30-35 mph with a lot of stop and go congested traffic.  I am amazed at the lack of problems.  I've owned a lot of cars in the last fifty + years, and this is one of the few that didn't start to nickel and dime me to death after the second anniversary of it's purchase.  

I may have to replace the original tires late this year.  The car handles so well and has such exceptional engineering, that I don't skid, or spin rubber, or jerk to a stop.  The Alero has plenty of power available when you need it and wonderful visibility in every direction.  I recommend the Alero as a dependable car for commuting, running errands, or even a college student because of the better than average gas mileage (approx. 22 in town and 27-28 on freeway).  The seats are fantastic for the driver and front-seat passenger, but the back seat is a little crowded.

The only drawback is that the car's interior is fantastic for one driver and one passenger, but very difficult for adults to enter the backseat area and sit comfortably once they have avoided strangulation by the seat belt anchoring position on the post.  This may be due to the fact I have a two-door.  We purchased the car for me and very seldom does anyone ride with me, so this isn't really a problem for us.  But, this might be an issue if a person had several small children or car pool riders. <i><b>Suggestion:</b></i> If it's raining, don't roll down the windows!  Or, do as I did and buy the plastic drip shields for the side windows.  They look great and work very well.<i>
