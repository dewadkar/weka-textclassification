                 When you first look at the 2nd Generation of Mitsubishi's Eclipse, what are the first words that come to mind: sleek, beautifully styled or perhaps just plain awesome.

     In 1995 Mitsubishi Introduced a totally new body style from the previous generation. Mitsubishi improved on it's turbo version drastically, adding a more powerful turbo, putting out more horsepower (195 1st generation vs. 210 2nd generation).  One of the big things better about the 2nd generation is its looks, I like that Mitsubishi took the Eclipse and made it more rounded, appealing to the eye. That is what attracted me to the Eclipses in the first place.Well I think that the engine parts were more reliable for the 2nd generation, I mean I think all of the bugs with the 1st generation motor were fixed for the 2nd generation. 

     Although Mitsubishi improved on its 2nd generation, some parts of the 1st generation were better: The 1st generation had a better turbo that could put out more boost. It had a better wastegate meaning that it could hold boost better.  The blow-off valve was better. The bottom end of the engine was built stronger so that the engine could take higher boost levels without having to be rebuilt. 

     If your a import lover and you enjoy speed then this car is for you. The best way to solve the handling problem (it is a little rough going around turns) is to buy a strut bar for the engine. This will drastically help your handling. If handling is a big deal for you and your not willing put a modifications on it, then you might want to steer clear of any Mitsubishi's and get yourself a Honda. Overall, the GS-T met and surpassed my expectations and I'm sure that the 2nd generation Eclipse will also.
