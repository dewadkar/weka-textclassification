            First introduced to the US in 2001, the Lexus IS 300 was a huge hit when it first arrived.  The problem is that this car isn't really quite a Lexus.  Sold in Europe and Japan as the Toyota Altezza, the Lexus branding is a clear attempt to command a higher price and to better position Lexus against BMW and Mercedes.  This car is rather like the odd duck of Lexus given that it's sportier than most
other Lexus but also lacks the refinement found in more expensive models like the GS 300 or LS 300.

First off, here's what's good about this car.
The IS 300 achieves 80% of maximum torque at 1800 RPMs which means lots of low end power.  The exterior styling is trendy and the lines are clean.  The only complaint I have is that the clear tail lights look too much like the lowered Hondas in the area (the riceboy cars).  The base model comes with lots of nice features like an in dash 6 CD 
changer, a 240 watt stereo with dual sub-woofers.  Most people opt for leather as well as a power moon roof, both are pretty much a necessity for purposes of resale.  The IS 300 also comes equipped with remote entry and trunk release integrated into the key.  The ride on the Lexus is very smooth despite its somewhat stiffer suspension.  The IS 300 corners very well and feels solid even during fairly rough driving.  

What's not to like about this car?  Well, lots of things actually. Despite the great low-end power, the engine lacks the excitement of other cars in terms of power delivery  throughout the mid and high range RPMs.  This leads to jerky starts when stepping on the gas without the continued delivery of power.  This is especially true when engaging the "ECT Power" mode where you feel like the over-anxious engine powers you off the line then disappoints by not  continuing to push you back in your seat.  Another  performance aspect that needs improvement is the traction control system.  Traction control engages far too frequently which results in unpleasant surprises when driving around.  While I realize that this is a performance
oriented luxury car, other cars in this class don't exhibit this behaviour.  The interior materials could also be improved somewhat.  The dashboard materials feel cheap and not at all what one might expect from a Lexus.  The leather escaine seats, while comfortably keeping the driver and 
passengers from sliding around during hard turns, looks like cloth and the mixture between the traditional and suede leather looks funny.  The interior space also leave a lot to be desired.  While I personally have no problems sitting in the car, it definitely feels somewhat cramped.
