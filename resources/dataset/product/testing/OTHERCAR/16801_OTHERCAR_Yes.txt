            Hi, my name is Courtney, and i love my Z28!!!  For as long as i can remember the Camaro Z28 had been my dream car.  I  loved the way it looked on the road, I loved the attention it would get from other people on the road, i loved how they sounded with modified exhaust on them. I just loved them period.  I knew one day i would have to get one, so I finally got it together saved my money and got one, and let me tell you, i have not had one regret.  My particular Z28 has a 6 speed, corvette LT1 engine in it, so it is slightly faster than some of the other models, and it will beat a corvette.  Take my word for it.  The car has the best handling, i never slide all over the road when it is wet, as you probably would in a mustang, and i live in Florida, so we do get our fair share of rain.  It has better traction and better steering than any other car i have driven.  This car, is the one car that I really love to drive, and i'm not afraid to drive it.  The ride is smooth and the stereo system is also great!!  There are so many things you can do with that car that it is unbelievable.  Bottom line:  I love Camaro Z28 (especially with 
T-Tops)!!!!   <br><br>
