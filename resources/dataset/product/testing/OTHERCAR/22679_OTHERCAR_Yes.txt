            After enjoying my first Grand Am for over 4 years, (you can read my review on it under the '94 Grand Am's) I purchased a 1998 Grand Am. After searching in 3 cities, at numerous dealerships, for several weeks, I came back to my loyal friend.

As a mother of two, comfort and reliability are VERY important to me.  My 1998 Grand Am offers both.  The interior is comfortable enough that even a 12 hour trip isn't torture.  The heat and air is very efficient and works quickly even in extreme conditions.  I've even made a trip in the back seat myself, with no complaints at all.


With a quad 4 engine, the car has plenty of power without guzzling gas.  The last time I checked, I was getting 32-34 miles to the gallon.  (in town-highway) With gas prices the way they are right now...that makes a huge difference!!!  The car is also a lot of fun to drive.  It handles very smooth, taking turns with ease.  It has dual airbags, ABS, cruise control (that works much better than the'94 model), automatic door locks and trunk release.

I think what I like most of all about my car is the appearance.  With the rounded rear and front end, the rear spoiler and compact size, it has the sleek appearance of a sports car...with a back seat.

I would highly recommend this car for nearly anyone.  It's fun and sporty enough for the student, and comfortable and roomy enough for the family of four.
