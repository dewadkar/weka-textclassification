            The PDC-300 is a good choice for a first digital camera in my opinion.  The price is nice and it is easy to use.

I purchased this camera at Wal-Mart mainly for use with my auctions at eBay.  I did not want to spend a great deal of money without comparing other cameras.  I didn't want to invest piles of money for a camera I would not use often.  For a camera I would use more extensively, I wanted to research and comparison-shop and read the consumer reports.  This camera was my best bet, however, for the stills I would use at the auction.

Included with my camera was a wrist strap, a registration card, tips sheet, PhotoMAX Image Maker instructions and CD-ROM, Quick Start instructions, AC adapter and power cord, instruction manual, and a special offer from AOL.  Also included was a soft protective carry case with a place on the back to slide your belt in so you can carry it on your hip.  A nice plus was the inclusion of 4 Eveready Energizer AA batteries.  The camera-to-PC cable (serial cable) and the camera-to-TV cable (video cable) was also included.  It was all packaged in a nice, sturdy box with a flap to open and view the contents safely.

As for computer requirements, you need and IBM PC or compatible, 486 CPU or higher, Windows 95 or higher, CD-ROM drive, 8 MB RAM, 17MB available on your hard drive, serial port, color monitor.

The instruction booklet is very informative and has good illustrations.  Troubleshooting is included in the back after some helpful tips.  If you get a tripod, the self-timer option is a plus.  

With the Image Maker CD-ROM you can edit your photos, send them with email, print your photos, save your photos, and even add some humor to them.  The camera features two distance setting.  They are Normal (for pictures 15 inches or more away) and Macro (for pictures 6 to 14 inches away).

After you press the shutter to take the picture, the LCD screen will show 'processing'.  When that disappears, you can take another picture.  The LCD has a brightness control which is a nice surprise for a camera of this price.  The LCD display will show you what picture you are about to take and the flash setting if you have chosen to have the icon display on.  There is an auto-flash feature also.

This camera will store 64 pictures.  You can transfer them to your computer or display them on your television.  You don't have to have the memory full (of 64 pictures) to do this.  You can do it anytime.  You can also erase them at anytime either from the camera itself or by using your computer.

There is a switch on the camera that allows the user to record or to play back images.  When it is set to play, you have the option of playing images back one by one or in rapid succession.  The one by one feature is helpful in erasing images from the memory if you know you will not want to keep that picture.

The manual goes through every option and ability in depth.  That fact is good for a beginner, as I was.

On to the specifications---the color is 24-bit color; resolution is 320x240 pixels; the flash memory is 2 megabytes; speed is ISO Guide 200; flash is electronic and built in; flash range is 15&quot; to 8'; self-timer-10 seconds; weight 10 ounces with batteries; compression is JPEG; and other specs.

Now for the drawbacks--the resolution, the battery-life, and loading and reloading time of the pictures using the CD-ROM.  The resolution is okay for a camera of this price but definitely not the best out there.  Often I have found the pictures are too dark when I load them on eBay.  Unsure if this is the fault of the camera or its user.  The batteries will definitely drain if you do not make use of the other power cords supplied whenever you can.  When transferring your pictures, take the batteries out and use the power cord.  I even do this when viewing pictures after I have taken them.  I also erase pictures solely by use of my computer.  The loading time after you click &quot;get picture&quot; with the Image Maker software is too slow for me.  Uncertain if this is my computer or the software.  Also, after you select pictures to erase, the reloading time is horrible if you have 25+ pictures stored.

All in all, this camera is worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a good, dependable first-time camera.
