            I bought my '96 Cutlass Coupe used in 1999 with 25,500 miles.  It was red, with dark gray leather, sunroof, 16&quot; alloy wheels, dual-zone climate controls, AM-FM, cassette, CD, and the 3.1 V6.  I felt it was an excellent car for the price and I loved the styling.  The handling was more responsive than I expected for an Oldsmobile.  The engine power was adequate for the car, but I wish I had opted for the 3.4 V6.  Other than the engine, this car had every available option and was very comfortable to drive.  It did have any annoying air leak on the driver's side at the A-pillar.  Both doors also rubbed the weatherstripping at the A-pillars, causing the paint on the inside of the doors to slowly rub off.  I later learned that this problem was common to the Cutlass coupes and that GM had issued a service bulletin on the problem.  Since the car was out of warranty, I did not have it fixed.

The car had 4-wheel disc brakes.  Never, ever, let anyone use air-powered rachets to install lug nuts.  The rotors were warped when I bought the car and needed to be turned.  Mechanically, I had absolutely no problems with the car.  Other than scheduled maintenance, I never had to do any work on the car.  The oil filter was a nightmare to reach, so I would recommend letting the dealer perform the oil changes.  I averaged 26 mpg, mostly in the city and on back roads.

Access to the rear seats is somewhat difficult, but no worse than any other 2-door car.  I would not recommend it for anyone who regularly has adults riding in the back seats.  Interior room was excellent and the visibility was outstanding.

Overall, this car was an outstanding value, very reliable and an incredibly good-looking car.  I would definitely recommend it!
