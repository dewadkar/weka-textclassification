            My family currently owns 2 Maximas, a 1995, and a 1998.  The reason we chose to purchase a second Maxima is due to the fact that not only are they a stylish luxury car, we have had no problems beside the obvious wear and tear of most vehicles.  We went all out on ours, including leather seats, sunroofs, and BOSE stereo systems.  We use it to travel on vacations all the time, and it is great for families.  It provides luxury for the adults, and the kids have plenty of rom in the back in which to play, fight, or spread out and sleep the trip away!  A very greatly balanced car.<br><br>
