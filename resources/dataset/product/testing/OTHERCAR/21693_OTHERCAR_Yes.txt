            The 1995 Honda Passport seemed to be a high end SUV when it came out.  Now that it is 4 years old, it has become more affordable for me.  It is a Honda and seems to keep its value like the cars, but it is still not a Honda compared to the last 2 Accords I owned.  The worst feature of this vehicle like most SUV's is the gas mileage.  Don't think you can get over 20 mpg's with this one.  One reason I can say it is definitely not a Honda is the noise when it idles.  It does not make considerable noise, but I was looking for the nice whisper my previous Accords had.  It is not a car I guess.  Overall I feel this vehicle suits me well since we live in an area where it does snow.  I would not recommend this vehicle to a southern climate customer who would never need 4 wheel drive.  Another item I found out about this Passport 4 wheel drive is you need to stop the vehicle when putting it into 4 wheel drive.  Also once you get it in, the front wheels only turn at a certain ratio in comparison to the rear wheels, thus when you step on it on ice, the rear end can still spin around.  This in my mind is not a true four wheel drive.  The couple friends I know who purchased this model have like them, mainly because the price dropped on these 1995 used models.  I would definitely not purchase one without the 15 inch tires.  The vehicle just doesn't look the same.<br><br>
