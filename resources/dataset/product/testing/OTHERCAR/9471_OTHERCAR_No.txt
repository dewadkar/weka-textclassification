            Wow, what can I say.  When I first saw this truck in 1993 in all the ads that Chrysler was running, I had to have it.  All of the ads saying that this was the most completely tested and engineered truck ever were all I needed.  I promptly went down to my dealership and ordered a loaded one from the factory.  It took a while, but when it arrived I was so happy......until I took delivery.  First things first.  The drivers door fit was terrible and had to be refit.  At 7000 miles it needed a new front end alignment and refastening of the tailgate which was coming loose.  At 11000 miles the steering began to feel very loose.  The steering dampener is replaced as it is leaking and thought to be the problem.  12000 miles: door needs realignment, and stereo stops working.  The Very loose and clunky steering again is looked at deemed normal.  This problem will haunt me later and eventually I find out that it is a known problem with these vehicles.  14000 miles:  First recall for steering wheel plugs and stereo is replaced when part arrives.  19773 miles:  Headlights need replacement and steering is judged to be faulty.  Parts ordered.  Second recall for seat belts at this time.  20238 miles:  Entire upper and lower steering column replaced.  Also replaced the emergency brake mechanism which failed.  28232 miles:  The clutch slave cylinder fails and needs replacement.  Also maddening rattles in the dash.  30042 miles:  Third recall for steering wheel back cover.  When work was done, steering wheel was replaced by dealership at literally 90 degrees off center.  It takes my almost raising my voice at the service manager to get them to put the steering back on center.    At this time the lumbar support in the seat fails.  I am told that it will cost $400 to repair.  I live with it.  But I have to replace the heating control knobs that broke off.  39758 miles:  Brake rotors shot.  42537 Miles:  NEW front brakes wearing VERY fast.  Brakes adjusted.  Also, other interior parts breaking off.  $60 for parts and I make repairs myself.  53845 Miles:  Fourth recall for steering column and window wipers.  54588 Miles:  Axle seal fails.  Seal replaced.  Fog lights fail approximately every three months even though I hardly ever use them.  

At this point I think that the problems are worked out and I can enjoy the truck.  Ha!  From here on out the repair costs and time spent taking this thing in to be repaired start to go ballistic.

69845 Miles:  Another rear axle seal fails.  71858 Miles:  Fifth recall for fuel tank roll over valve.  Also rattle in catalytic converter is noted.  I am told this is normal by dealership.  Also more plastic parts for sunvisors break requiring replacement.  80000 Miles:  Steering going really loose and clunky again.  84466 Miles:  Replace the front track bar assembly which failed catastrophically almost stranding us, to the tune of $450  This is another known problem with these vehicles.  The steering still feels scary.  The dealership says this is normal for these vehicles, but they will not provide me with any documentation saying they feel this vehicle is safe to drive.  I have another shop replace the steering column again, costing $350.  86000 Miles:  The catalytic converter fails catastrophically stalling the engine out on the freeway in the middle of utah on a rainy Sunday evening.  A call to a tow-truck company reveals they will charge me $500 to tow into St. George.  I decide to get into town by cutting holes in the exhaust just prior to the catalytic converter.  Chrysler refuses to replace it as I cut holes in the exhaust to get into town.  Go figure.  Replacement cost at some other Chrysler dealership in St. George Utah $300.  88709 Miles:  Rear differential fails.  I am told that the parts that failed cannot be ordered from Chrysler anymore as Chrysler has deemed the original design faulty.  I am forced to purchase a completely new rear differential assembly for parts and labor of almost $1700.  Also a known issue with Chrysler.  700 miles later, the brand new bearings in the differential fail.  The shop repair this at no cost, replacing all the bearings with new products from Chrysler.  1000 miles later, the bearing fail again.  The new $1700 differential housing was deemed to be a faulty part from Chrysler and will have to be completely replaced.  Thatï¿½s where we are now.  The truck is in the shop again.

I should note that this vehicle sees very light service with mostly highway miles.  I have towed with it twice.  It always gets regular service every 3500 miles.  The brakes get replaced when needed as do the tires and belts hoses etc.  I did not include the regular service as part of my history above as these things should be done.

My current status is when the stock market recovers a bit, I will be buying a new Toyota Land Cruiser.  I will be very hard pressed to ever purchase another Chrysler product.  The poor service, the bad attitude from the service people and the abysmal reliability of a vehicle that is supposed to be RAM Tough have tainted my experience.
