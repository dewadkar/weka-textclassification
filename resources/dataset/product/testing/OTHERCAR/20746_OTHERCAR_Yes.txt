<TEXT>
            Our 1998 Chevrolet Blazer is a very beautiful, sporty vehicle.  The 4X4 option is handy in the snow, she drives like a gem, and has very comfortable seating.  But, I do not recommend this for a family of more than four.  Seating in the back fits three tightly and would be most comfortable seating just two.  And if you have a car seat to add to that scenario, it makes squeezing three in the back extremely cramped.  I love our Blazer, but with a family of five it is just not very practical.  I recommend the Blazer for those with smaller families.<br><br>
