            I needed to replace my work pickup, and after careful consideration chose the 2001 Dodge 3500 4x4 diesel. In my line of work I haul heavy loads, parts and equipment to remote areas. I needed a vehicle that would stand up to the punishment of off-road as well as pulling equipment trailers at highway speeds,and the Dodge fit the bill. Plenty of power and torque (I did add a dealer installed power chip for a little more pep) to pull trailers rangeing from 10,000 to 17,000 lbs. In the mountains or on flat ground the Dodge handles the task.
 The body style is either love it or hate it. Ride and comfort are very smooth considering it is a one ton.  Front seating is ample although passengers in the rear seat are a bit cramped. Driving a pickup of this size is much like driving the family car.The cummins diesel provides ample power and torque for those who pull horse trailers, travel trailers and boats with good fuel economy. Anyone who pulls trailers or heavy loads should check out this pickup. It's built for serious people pulling serious loads. 
Vechile Description:
2001 Dodge Ram 3500 4x4 Diesel 5.9L (360cid)
Heavy Duty 4spd automatic, with 3.55 gear ratio Limited Slip rear end.
Power chip from Van Aaken ( www.vanaaken.com )
Stock horse power 235
Stock torque 460 ftlbs
Horse power with chip   295 hp with 619 ftlbs torque.

I have used this pickup with and without the chip and recommend using the chip the difference is very noticeable, with a gain in fuel economy of about 3mpg over stock. And with rising fuel prices any gain is good.
 For those who think the 3500 is to much for their needs check out the 2500 (3/4 ton) it offers much the same options without the dual rear wheels. Either way I think new purchasers will be pleased.<br><br>
