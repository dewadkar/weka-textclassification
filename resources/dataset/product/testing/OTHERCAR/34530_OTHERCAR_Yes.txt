            This camera was my first adventure into digital photography.  I am an experienced weekend photo shooter, but never anything serious.  I was impressed with this camera because of it's simple nature, not a lot of adjusts needed and also that it was a 1 megapixel camera under $300.00.
I have had this camera for about 9 month's now and have used it in almost every situation from a dimly lighted room to the outside under direct bright sunlight.  I have never had any bad experience in any condition the camera seems to be able to handle any situation.
The things I like most about this camera:
1. Small size, easily fits in a carry on bag for the plane
2. Powerful 1 megapixel resolution, under that and pictures are really grainy.
3. Easy to use, I used it right out of the box with minimum effort.
4. Ability to transfer photos either by serial cable or flash memory card, this is great because the photo printer I have allows you to directly print from the flash memory card no need to use the computer.
5. Storage system.  It stores photos on a removable flash memory.  16mb card holds about 80 medium quality photos, 120 low quality, and 35 or 40 High quality.
Things that I don't like or needs some looking at by HP
1. Serial connection cable to download pictures is hard to use, mine gets stuck in the port on the camera and you feel like your breaking it to get it out (even though I have checked with HP it's not broken :) )
2. Software that comes with the camera is limited, basically only photo management software, and printing software (allows you to print out multiple prints sizes, and types on one page)
3. Only comes with a small 8 mb flash memory cartridge needs to be bigger amount of memory.
4. Recovery of camera after taking a shot is slow, takes about 15 seconds for the camera to be ready to use again, not good for multiple action shots. 
I think that the camera is a great investment, but I think the software that it comes with is limited and that the recovery time is too long for fast moving action.

Overall, I like this camera, easy to use and a great beginner digital camera.
