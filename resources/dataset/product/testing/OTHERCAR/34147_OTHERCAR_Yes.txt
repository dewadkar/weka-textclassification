            The 2000 Lexus LX 470(a.k.a. Toyota Land Cruiser) is the best
luxury SUV, next to the Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG. It is a neatly
packed steel and aluminum SUV, with all the elements of luxury,
style, performance, and off-road capabilities. 

<b>The Interior/Ride/Handling/Comfort:</b> 

This LX470's interior is awesome. Sitting in the driver seat gives
you a feeling of being on top of a mountain. Everything is right
in-front of you. The wood dash accents the leather and gives
you a feeling of ultimate pride to be driving it. The rear captain
seats are designed for the passengers maximum comfort, and
that is what it does. The rear bench seat on the other hand was
mainly designed for small kids, so if you are over 5'10&quot; and wiegh
over 170 don't even try to go back there. One factor I was really
dissapointed with is that this SUV is huge, yet it hardly has any
trunk space. The handling of the LX470 is incredible, you are
glued to the road. Despite its high center of gravity it doesnt roll
much on sharp corners. The Lexus LX470 is a great Luxury SUV
that is sure to please.

<b>The Powerplant/Specs/Performance:</b> 

The Lexus LX470 comes equipped with a 4.7liter/230hp V8
powerplant, that chews out all the torque you will ever need. The
added safety and performance of VSC and Off-Road Traction
Control makes the LX470 an Off-Road monster with elegance. 

<b>The Last Word:</b>

The LX470 is great for a night onthe town, or like I said litteraly
with its 5390lbs of wood, leather, and steel its an off-road
monster. Besides the bulky look, its got a dead quite ride. New for
2000 are : illuminated running boards, moonroof, and illuminated
key-less entry. The Lexus LX470's only downside is its rear cargo
and passenger space. My overall grade : <b>A</b> <br><br>
