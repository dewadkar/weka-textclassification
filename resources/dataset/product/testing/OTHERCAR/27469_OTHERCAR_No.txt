            A few weeks ago, I had a wedding to go to with my fiancee in Philadelphia.  The weekend was perfect, and the Sable could not have run any better... except... when I stopped at the toll booth (only about 2 miles from home) the car died... poof - the end.  It would not go any further, and when I accelerated, nothing happened.  Anyway, it had to get towed, and I could not believe my luck.  But I began to think about &quot;my luck&quot; and the past couple months in my household, a home with 2 Mercury Sables.  This happened a couple months before with the other Sable, in which the transmission went and cost us $1500.  It can't happen again, can it?  To our other car?  Well it did, and this one cost $1700.  We were furious.  We take excellent care of our cars, for they are such a large investment.  We had a few problems with the cars in the past, maybe $50 here, $100 there, but still we could not believe a car with 50,000 miles (93 Sable) and a car with about 70,000 (90 Sable) both needed towing within a couple months of each other.  I talked to the mechanic who fixed the BOTH cars, and he said that he does more Sables than any other car.  As a matter of fact, at his shop he had 2 Sables (one besides ours), a mustang, and 2 Tauruses.  Of course, we called the Ford Motor Company, and they did not even want to hear it.  This was the first time we ever purchased 2 Ford manufactured cars, and also the last.  Unless you have a lot of money to put into a car when you purchase it, because of towing, break-downs, and transmissions (which they are noted for - to break down) do not purchase this car.<br><br>
