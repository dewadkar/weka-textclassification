            Ever since High School I told my self that if I made it through college and the amount of loans I took out didn't match that of the national debt, that I would buy myself a phat car...

After graduation I was looking for a car harder than I was looking for a job.  Eventually though I was able to land a better than descent first job and decided its time to purchase. I was looking at Impala SS, Cadillac STS, or anything that projected power and agility.  Finally flipping through the auto trader I saw a 98 Lincoln Mark VIII for $19,900, and with no time to spare I found myself at the dealership.  It was a Lincoln/Mercury retailer that just to also happened to have a used car section where the Lincoln was located.

When I was approached by a salesman I played dumb, which in my opinion is the best way to handle those slippery characters.  I started mentioning a 2000 Sable and possible a Mystic, but while walking through the lot I saw my baby, there she was the Mark VII.  Then I preceeded to mention how attractive that car looked. The sales person continually tried to get my mind off the Mark VIII, and then said that it was going for $23,500 and with a very suprised look on my face, I said &quot;really, I thought I saw it in the auto trader for $19,900,&quot; and then preceeded to pull that exact auto trader out of my brief case.  At this point the sales person was in a pinch, he tried to play it off like it was just a miss print and that it held no validity.... He then tried to adjust my attention to a brand new LS which is completly out of the question, and I kept bringing up the Mark VIII.

Well enough bably one thing led to another and I made them stick to the $19,900 w/ help from another salesman who felt the urgency for me to get the Mark VIII.
