            This camera takes an excellent shot, with pixels over 3.3 Million!  With a 6x optical and an 8x digital zoom, the is camera is great fore the person who likes high quality close up photos.  This camera has a very clear LCD screen in the back which allows for an easy to use menu system and picture reviewing, and a viewfinder for taking pictures outdoors.  This camera runs on a Sony Memory Stick, which can also be used in Sony MP3 Players and digital camcorders.  It downloads through a USB interface, and for those of you who only have serial, a floppy disk adapter is available for easy accessability straight ones floppy drive.  This camera comes with a rechargable Lithium Ion battery for a convenient power supply.  This camera takes a beautiful picture and captures good coloring.  The pictures can be easily enlarged without distortion, for a high quality photo.  This camera would be a great buy for anyone.  I highly recommend it!  <br><br>
