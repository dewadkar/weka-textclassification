            If you want a sporty car for a very reasonable price, then the Eclipse is the one for you. With "I-Look-More-Expensive-Than-I-Am" looks, this is definitely a head-turner, especially in silver. Inside it has a powerful V6 engine going to 200hp. Of course, you could expect more horsepower, and wonder why Mitsubishi discontinued the turbo engine... But I dont complain. Acceleration is very good, slightly over 7s for 0-60mph, and good performance at high speeds. I heard people saying they went up to 150mph, but I didn't go over 125 for fear of cops, and road conditions... Anyway, at 125 it surely shows it can get much higher. One problem could be the high-rev maximum torque, which occurs at 5000 rpm, meaning you have to rev strongly before being pressed to the back of your seat. The engine makes a nice sound, resembling an italian sports car.

Inside, it looks stylish (I have leather), comfy, but very incomfortable in the backseats (but who cares?). I have the GT Premium Package, which comes with nice features, like ABS, traction control, power sunroof, 4-InDash-CD Changer, etc. I heard complaints about poor reliability, but also good words about this. I didn't have major problems in one year since I bought it... the only problem was something with the chair restraint system, which was promptly fixed. Oh, and worse problem were 3 traffic tickets in 1 year.

If you're looking for a sporty car within $25.000, this should be the best choice. Competition should be the Celica, Cougar or Integra, but Celica is 4 cylinders, Cougar is slower and Integra is slower and uglier (Sorry Acura fans!). I raced all of those, and outpaced them... I also outpaced Mustangs, a Z3, two times Carreras, so I feel very good about this car.

The Eclipse handles very well, has a good skidpad, you feel very in control behind the wheel. One minus - a very wide turning circle.
