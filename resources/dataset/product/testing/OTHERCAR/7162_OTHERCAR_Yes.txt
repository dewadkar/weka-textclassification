            I love this van!!!  When I went to the dealer my friends all said, &quot;You are not going to get a mini-van?&quot; and I said &quot;absolutely.&quot;  With three kids and strollers and diaper-bags, this is the car for me.  I could care less about the stigma of the mini-van, this is the most convenient car I have ever owned. 
 
I prefer the caravan over the grand-caravan for the ease of driving, the shorter back end makes it easy to park and it hugs corners quite well.  The back hatch opens and will allow plenty of room for a stroller and several bags, or a full van full of groceries and shopping bags. 

 In the two years that I have owned it, it has been dependable and started every winter with no complications.  In driving several brands, the Dodge Mini-van was more solid, had nicer colors and the two sliding doors makes getting kids in and out very convenient.  I can't say enough for this car.

  The dealer was quick to try and push the larger grand-caravan on me, but the smaller van drives like a four-door car and isn't like driving a boat.  I highly recommend getting the tinted windows as I did, especially for sunny days and the visibility for children is wonderful.  This is a great car for mom's and anyone that has to transport children.  Car seats go in with ease.  Like I said, &quot;I love this van!&quot;<br><br>
