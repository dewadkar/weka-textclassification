            We love our car, we bought it Brand spanking new in 1996 and it has never given us a problem.  We are a honda family. we'll never own another brand of car. We have put 120,000.00 miles on it, and its still going as good as the first day we bought it.

We have taken it on several trips to florida, and it rides great.  It has very comfortable seats and is very roomy. Its also very quiet.. you can't hear road noise at all.


If you're thinking of buying a Honda, believe me you can't go wrong.
This will be one of the best purchases that you've ever made.<br><br>
