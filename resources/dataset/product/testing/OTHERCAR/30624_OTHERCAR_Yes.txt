            I was drawn to the 2001 Aurora, 3.5 V6, because of it's unique, luxurious and yet sporty body style and accessories.  Before buying the car, I checked it against comparable luxury Japanese, American and European makes.  In most, if not all cases, the Aurora seemed to outclass these cars.  This is a great car for someone with the money to buy a BMW or Lexus and the like, but would like to own something different and not so common.  I have now owned my Aurora for about 8 months.  It gets lots of looks, attention and admiration.  I enjoy driving the car.  Unfortunately there are some negatives.  Namely, still American parts and workmanship.  Things seem to break and go wrong too soon.  Most are minor, like irritable dash and console noises.  But I have also experienced things such as the transmission slamming into gear in traffic situations, having to have a sensor replaced there and also the harness connectors tightened to remedy the problem.  I have had moving parts on the underside loosen and make irritable noise, however, there were easily fixed.  I had to have an oil sensor replaced in the pan because it was not accurately telling me that my car was almost 2 quarts low on oil.  There was also a technical advisory on problems with wind noise causing a howling sound by way of air moving through the trunk cracks if the car was driven over 60 mph and so a rubber seal had to be ordered.  It has been things of that nature.  On the positive side though, it is a beautiful car, fun to drive and I have gotten just great treatment from service and sales management alike after buying the car from my dealership.
