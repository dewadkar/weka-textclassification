            After 8 years on Civic # 2 I bought a 2002 Civic EX.  
I like the new design and the consideration of all the new safety features &#150 of which Honda does very well.
When at the dealership- and looking at the 2002 civics and accords &#150 the accords just looked a bigger version of the civic.  The 2003 accord, of course, looks great and nothing like the civic.  
The re-designed dash is nice and there are options to modify the interior after market to personalize it to you, which is also nice. 
I appreciate the air filters that constantly filter the incoming air &#150 but I REALLY like that now, I am able to change out the filters every 15,000 miles or so.
The car handles nice &#150 I miss the old suspension.  
It is nice to not have to roll out of the car to get out (seems like they raised the seats), however, it seems like they re-designed the car for the shorter population.  Being a height of 5&#14611&#148 I now appreciate all the room that I had in my old car. 
I do like the fact that they took out the hump in the middle of the back seat.  
The cup holders were re-designed nicely- even has a space for a coffee cup handle. 
I have owned the car for 1 year and 2 months.  The problems I have had so far have been very minor but the dealer states that the problems I am having, several other customers are also having.
At 20,00 miles
My vents, I am told, were not engineered correctly and do not keep their position &#150 the are loose.
The cloth on my two front doors has bubbled. I took it back once and their solution was to poke holes in the fabric and squirt more glue in there &#150 this did not work &#150 the bubbles soon re-appeared and I will have to go back again. 
I don&#146t know what type of glass they are using on the windshield but I noticed that it seemed to be pitted very quickly and cracked. 
When I roll down my windows in the back &#150 they make a very strange  noise like they are having a hard time holding their position. 
The biggest complaint I have is when the brakes are depressed, especially when first leaving where ever I am parked &#150 in warm or cold weather, the brakes seem to make a knocking sound.  This is something that the dealer also says is common.  They say there is nothing they can do for that.  This is not something I want to live with for the next 5 &#150 10 years. 
So far, that is thankfully all in all it is a nice new car with only a few quirks so far.
