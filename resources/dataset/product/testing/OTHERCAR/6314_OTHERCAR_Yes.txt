            When I went to the Dodge dealership, I intended to buy a Neon, it is economical, kind of sporty and fell within my price range.  Also on the lot that day was an Avenger.  The striped down Avenger was about a thousand dollars more than the loaded Neon, but I thought I would give it a test drive for comparisons sake.  I fell in love immediately.  The Avenger has a much more solid drive, it is roomier and feels like it costs more than it does.  My friends always compliment me on my car after asking what it is!  The Avenger is rather uncommon on the roads, and I am constantly aware of people giving it a double take, or searching the sides or back bumper to see what kind of car it is.  And this is in Los Angeles, where people can be real car snobs!  I have found the ride to be exceptionally smooth, quiet and particularly responsive.  I average about 22 mpg during regular commuting, and about 30 mpg on long highway trips.  Not terribly economical but worth it!  And though I did not get the larger engine available, it still has kick and seems especially powerful going up hill.  I love cars!  And there are few cars I would trade this one in for.  The back seat is very spacious, for even my taller friends, and the trunk is so large people gasp when they see it!  This is the 5th car I have owned in my life and, even after 3 years, by far my favorite!  <br><br>
