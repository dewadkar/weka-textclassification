            I have been an avid photographer since the late 60s. Over the last few years, however, I've taken less and less photos--until I got my first digital camera.  I currently have three digis: An Olympus D-600, Nikon 950, and a Kodak 4800.  I guess you could call me the one, two, three (mega pixels) kid!

I reviewed a lot of cameras before considering the Kodak 4800.  The sample photos that this camera generates were very impressive.

The camera had everything I wanted: compactness, three mega pixel resolution, and a real flash synch connector.

Some of my photo experiences 

I live in beautiful western North Carolina.  This year, I shot at least 600 photos of the fall foliage with the Kodak.  The Kodak's default saturation mode is not unlike their Kodachrome slide film.  I happen to like the saturated look of this color.  If this saturation is too much, the saturation can be reduced via a menu item.

The Kodak's zoom range is in the 35 to 85mm range.  This really works well for me, because I enjoy shooting wide angle vistas.

I also enjoy available light photography.  The Kodak shines in this area, and I was happy to see that night time exposures up to 8 seconds in length at ISO 100 produced zero noise! 

Another great plus about this camera:  F-stops can be selected from a top  mounted dial--no digging through menus to do this!!
