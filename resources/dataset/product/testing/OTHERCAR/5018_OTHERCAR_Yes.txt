            I picked up the Sentra SE after test driving the Sentra GXE, Toyota Corolla, and Honda Civic.  I ended up picking up the Sentra SE over the GXE because of the power difference (the GXE uses a 1.8L 126HP engine, while the SE uses a 2.0L 145HP engine -- a VERY noticeable difference).
The main problem people have with the Sentra in general is the seat size, but looking at the Corolla, it didn't seem much smaller.  So I wouldn't take much away from it (if you were really looking for spaciousness, then "compact car" is the wrong category for you).

I picked up the Performace Package with the car (16" rims, spoiler, Stage 2 suspension, audio upgrade, security, ...), and the car handles beautifully (I just wish they didn't use firestone tires).  The ergonomics are very pleasing, reminiscent of a Maxima with the white, titanium lined gauges.  The leather wrapped steering wheel feels very solid, with the seats being very comfortable.  NOTE: WHEN UPGRADING WITH THE PERFORMANCE PACKAGE, THE SEATS ARE UPGRADED TO THE MOST HIDEOUS/UGLY SEATS IN THE WORLD.  My dealer had an option for dealer installed leather seats -- you should definitely ask, as leather seats aren't available as an option.

Handling for the car is good.  Wind noise at higher speeds is a lot lower than you would expect.  Pickup speed is good also, probably due to the 145 HP engine.  I would advise getting the SE over the GXE, as there are many features unable on the GXE.  Another thing that I noticed was that I could not find one dealer that had a car with the side-impact airbags/ABS, so consider yourself lucky if you do.

This is also the second year that this sentra design has been out, so it should not have any of those "first year defect" problems that first year cars have.

All in all, I would not have expected this kind of performance from a Sentra.  Had I just based my decision on the previous line of Sentras I would have missed out big time.  For the price, you definitely cannot find the same options/performance anywhere else.
