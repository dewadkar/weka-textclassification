            As a regular user of SLR cameras,I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the digital photos.  I found that this with a little practice, (mostly to find all of the many functions and the numerous things I can do with it), it was actually very easy to use.  The photo quality is great. I love how fast and easy it is to change lenses with the just a menu setting!  The software that comes with it works great too.  Use some sort of card reader to download the pictures to your hard drive, since batteries for all digital cameras are expensive and have a short life.  I can not complain about the battery life, since I was able to take over 150 photo's on one battery.  

The body style, shape and color seems outdated.  It is a boring black, and not as slim as some of the nicer looking silver colored digital cameras.  They could have worked on making it a little more attractive looking.
