            I looked long and hard for an interesting car to own and drive that
met the needs of a busy family of four living in mid-town Manhattan.
I need room, safety, reliability and professional local service.  I had
owned Saab, Audi, Nissan, VW and Subaru over the years...never
thought I'd have a Benz.  The new  Mercedes wagons are out of my price range, but the used one I got from Mercedes Manhattan is absolutely lovely..an absolute joy to drive, with lots of room for my youngsters and their stuff. 
                          
Who should buy this car...These older E320 wagons have a blend
of style, roominess, quality and understated prestige which is 
ideal for someone who likes cars and driving, wants to avoid SUVs
and is comfortable paying the premium asked.   I am very pleased
with mine and think it is worth the price.
