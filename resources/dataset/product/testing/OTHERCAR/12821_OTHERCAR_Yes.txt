            We purchased a 97 Altima new, in 1996.  And I absolutely love it.  It has just been a fantastic car.  <br>Absolutely no service problems - regular oil changes is all we have ever had to do to it, and the factory brake pads made it to over 55,000 miles.  It is a smooth ride, with plenty of head and leg room.  My husband is over six feet tall, and he has more room in our Altima than in my friend's Lexus.  He actually has to open the sunroof so his head won't touch the headliner!<br><br>It is easy to wash the outside, and to clean the inside.  It has a very roomy interior as well.<br><br>It holds two Century Smartmoves with enough room for a slender adult in between them, with plenty of floor board space - even with the front seats moved back.  <br><br>But, the best feature is how safe I feel driving it, and putting my children in it.  I was rear ended recently, and although I was hit pretty hard, the rear bumper was hardly damaged at all.  We only realized how well it had handled and distributed the impact, after we took it to the shop.  The understructure of the bumper was damaged, and the front end was even knocked out of alignment.  I had no idea that we were hit with that much force.<br><br>Since we are pregnant with our third, we are having to consider something else.  I hate to think about it.  I love my Altima.<br><br>The only con I can think of is that in very rainy weather, the driver's door becomes difficult to open, although there is nothing physically wrong with it.  Just an oddity I suppose. =) <br><br><br>
