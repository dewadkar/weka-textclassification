            First of all, I'd like to start off by pointing out that the picture provided for the Solara is OLD!!! That isn't what the 04' Solara looks like at all! The new Solara's body style can be compared to a Mercedes CLK because it's sleek, simple, a 2 door, and the windows and the body have the curvation of a Mercedes. 

The car I had before the Solara was a 2003 Toyota Corolla. 
I chose to get another Toyota because I think they're top quality when it comes to cars. 
	When I saw the new Solaras, I couldn't believe it was a Toyota! It looks like something you'd only see as a concept car. It's amazingly sporty in design, unlike the old Solaras, and much appreciated by me is the modern look of the interior. The interior is silver (if you by the SE model) near and around the radio and a/c controls and also by the doors. It looks so "techie." lol. 

	Another thing I love is how the automatic transmission is set up. On the driver's right side, you'll see the shift knob for the automatic transmission located between the 2 front seats. What&#146s different is the way the knob slides. Instead of making a long line to slide from park to drive to neutral, Toyota &#147slanted&#148 or &#147curved&#148 the line. What does this mean to you? Well, it&#146s a safety device. A couple of times, I have found myself to accidentally switch my gear to neutral when I really wanted to put it on drive. I may hit it because I&#146m leaning over to get something, etc. The point is, this new curved line stops the knob from moving where you don&#146t want it to and it definitely comes in handy when there are other people in the car who may accidentally hit the knob and cause the knob to shift, if, for instance, they&#146re changing the radio station.

The new Solara has a V6 engine, but you can get a V4 on some models, but it&#146s not as common for this particular car. The colors are silver, &#147absolutely red,&#148 black and granite, although there are a few more I&#146m not quite sure of. 

My new Solara is silver and it&#146s so darn gorgeous!!! I get compliments from people walking by all the time. It&#146s definitely a looker=) You can get cloth or leather seats in black or light grey. 

The Solara gives you about 23 miles to the gallon and about 30 highway miles (to the gallon). The good mileage on the Corolla is really the only thing I really really miss. The performance of the car is outstanding. The cabin noise is&#133well, there is NO cabin noise! And as for the control when I&#146m turning, I haven&#146t even heard the car screech even once when I&#146ve made a tight turn on a tight curb. I do wish the doors weren&#146t so darn heavy, but after all, it is a 2-door and those doors always seem heavier then the doors of a 4-door car. I&#146m not too happy about the back seats. It&#146s not very spacey and my friends say there&#146s not enough leg room. Oh well! It&#146s still a sexy lookin&#146 car. Hehe. 

I believe there are 2 or 3 models to chose from , the SE, the SLE, and some other initials that I can&#146t remember. I have the SE, which is the cheaper one. The SLE is a bit more expensive because there are a few luxury features that the SE doesn&#146t come standard with. To tell you the truth, I like the cheaper SE better because of the silver trim in the interior (which I mentioned in the beginning). The SLE has a wooden trim in the interior, which I don&#146t like at all. 

One of my favorite things is the safety feature on the steering wheel. You can change the radio volume, the radio station, or a cd track at the press of a button! Another awesome feature is the screen on the dashboard that gives you valuable information. Here&#146s a list of what the screen gives you:
Range &#150 ie. The amount of miles you can go with the amount of gas you have left in your tank
Temperature
Time
MPG &#150 Miles (driven) per gallon
MPH &#150 Average miles per hour you are going

If there was one reason for you to get this car, I&#146d say do it for the look of the car. It&#146s so hot and so well priced. I got mine brand new for $21,000 at Libertyville Toyota in Illinois. I bet you can even get it a lil&#146 cheaper if you negotiate a price. 

My second reason for you would be the Toyota quality you&#146re getting. Toyota stands behind their vehicles and they have great warranties. Their cars last for years and you can go well over 150,000 miles on a Toyota easily! 

If you&#146re really interested in this car, please feel free to email me at anae428@yahoo.com with any questions you have. 

Thanks,
Your epal, Ana
