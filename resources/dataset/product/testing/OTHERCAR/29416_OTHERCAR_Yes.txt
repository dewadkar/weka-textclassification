            After three years on the market, the Porsche Boxster has been given two new performance increases. The one which is available on the new Boxster S, with its engine bored and stroked from 2.5 to 3.2 liters and elevated from 201 to 250 hp. Accompanying the elevated energy level are a six-speed gearbox, a pumped-up suspension, a higher level of trim and features, and twin exhaust outlets.
If you've driven a Boxster, think of the new S model as simply having more of everything. Performance increases dramatically now that the quarter-mile time is in the 13-second range, with top speed at an even 160 mph. The elevated pace is easily matched by the firmer underpinnings and larger brakes, maintaining the all-around balance that makes the Boxster so satisfying to drive.
With the 2000 models, the base Boxster also gets an engine boost to 2.7 liters and 217 hp. Both versions retain the eminently practical twin trunks, the rapid power-operated top, and the comfortably arrayed cabin. As an outstanding sports car that can also handle the everyday grind, the Boxster, in either form, remains superb.
