            I have to admit that since I was young, I always admired anything that had four wheels and a VW sign. Since I was starting College in September, I was looking to buy a nice Volkswagen between the years 94-96. I found a nice red Golf CL 1995. The dealer asked for 5,000 canadian. I bargained it to 4,500$. 

First of all, I decided to write this review because I noticed that not many people had written a thorough review on a Golf yet. Second, most of the reviews talk about the negative aspects of this car. I won't deny it, there are a few bad things about Volkswagen's products. However, Volkswagens have also plenty of positive aspects!

The Exterior:
The style is simple, yet stylish. The car kept is squared style from its previous model (1988-1992). Since my car was a two door, it was considerably smaller than it's sister, the 4-door. I have no negative comments to make on the exterior components, except for the side molding. I was told by the Volkswagen dealer that almost every molding on my Golf will eventually fall off. My first one fell off last week and I've only had it for two months! If this ever happens to you, I recommend you buy some epoxy glue and glue them back on yourself. DON'T GO TO YOUR DEALER for this problem! They will only stick it back on with cheap german glue and it will eventually fall off again.

The interior: 
The interior isn't comparable to that of a mercedes, but I think that it's very decent for the price. The dash is mounted high, which makes it a bit weird at first... especially if you are used to drive sporty cars where the dash is very low. The plastics used aren't too cheap. I haven't ran into any major problems yet... except for the horn which isn't working at all... although I'm pretty sure it's just a fuse. After reading some reviews on older Volkswagens, I noticed that one problem specific to VWs that came up often was leaking with the sunroof. In my case, I haven't encountered such a problem... I'll just keep my fingers crossed!

Power Door Locks is a nice feature that comes standard on all VW Golfs and Jettas. The whole door lock system, which includes the doors, the trunk and the gas panel is controlled by the master key. Turning the key to the left once unlocks the driver's door. Turning the key to the left twice unlocks every door, including the trunk and the gas panel. Turning the key once to the left will lock everything up and warn you with the horn (when it works) that the anti-theft system is on. 

Performance:
Unfortunately, I didn't have the money at the time to buy a GTI... So my engine is only a 1.8L 4-cylinder... performance is very decent. The car has an unbelievable torque, especially with the manual transmission. If you are into drag racing, I strongly recommend to buy the GTI, which comes with a VR6 engine. From what I've heard, VW's VR6 engine in stunning.

Handling:
Every Volkswagen owner will tell you that what they like the most is probably the handling of VWs. This car is like a tank! I often take curves at very high speeds and my Golf sticks to the road. I know from experience that certain cars, especially GMs, don't stick at all to the road. (i.e. Sunfires) 

However, VWs seem to have a problem with the wheel alignment. I had my car aligned a month ago, and I'm already starting to have problems again. My steering wheel shakes and I slightly turned to the left when the car goes in a straight line.

Fuel Economy:
This car runs very cheap on gas! I can go to school for a whole week with 25 canadian dollars worth of gas. I live in the suburbs of Montreal, and my school is located in downtown Montreal. This gives you an idea of how this car is easy on gas. 

In short, This car meets all of my expectations... I would strongly recommend buying a Golf to anyone who is interested in buying a small and reliable car. 

UPDATE:

I have several comments I'd like to add on my review. First, the constant wheel allignment problem I referred to earlier was caused by a dented wheel rim, which has nothing to do with the car itself.

Second, I've ran twice into the same problem with this car: the computer. Three months ago, my car refused from starting in a parking lot. It turned out the computer stopped working. I replaced the computer for 400$. Last week, my Golf suddenly stopped on my street for the same reason. Repairing it will cost my another 400$. I have no idea what's causing this but let's just say that having the same expensive problem twice is enough to make you real angry.

And third, I have a little story to tell about the questionable security with those cars. My roomate go into an accident two weeks ago with the same Golf model. She has been hit on both lateral sides. She has significant brain trauma and is still in a coma as of today...
