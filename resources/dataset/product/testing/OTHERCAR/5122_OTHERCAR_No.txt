            I bought a 1994 Intrepid ES, top of the line right from the showroom floor. I absolutely loved the styling, road handling and the power of the 3.5 engine. All was well for the first 44000 miles. The transmission went out and of course I was 8000 miles out of warranty. I appealed to Chrysler that the transmission should outlast the first set of tires so out of the goodness of their heart they repaired it at a cost of $100 to me. In the next 30000 miles the lens popped out of the rear window stoplight, power antenna quit, computer that operated the climate control went out twice (at $300+ a pop)fuel rail leak developed, I paid for that but was later reimbursed under recall, security system malfunctioned intermittently keeping the car from starting (that went on for a month), tierod bushings had to be replaced and at the time I traded it in there was another recall out for the engine cradle mounts. From 44 to 74000 miles it seemed that it was in the shop more than out. Good side,- brakes were still good at 74,000 - two of the four original tires lasted for 70000 miles and the car was still relatively squeak -rattle free. I still loved it when I thankfully got rid of it - but lost a lot of confidence in Chrysler with that car. Their styling is great but quality is really suspect.<br><br>
