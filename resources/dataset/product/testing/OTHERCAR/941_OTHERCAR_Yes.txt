            I bought my Kia almost 5 years ago in 1995...they were new on the market, and I had heard many good things about them, including the fact that they used strong steel for the body and that the safety standards were good.  I wasn't actually in the market for a KIA at the time, I had it in mind, but I was after a Saturn.  I was living in a small Central California city, and the Saturn dealer just didn't have what I wanted, nor were they willing to haggle a better price.  So, onto plan two...I decided I would go to the new KIA dealership and see for myself what these new imports were all about.  I found a Sephia that I liked, a lower end model, but with all the options I wanted and i took it for a test drive.  I liked they way it handled, and with a gas mileage of almost 40 on the open highway, and about 32 around town I was impressed.  What also impressed me was the fact that I was able to purchase it out the door for $12,000.  

I was totally pleased with the car, and told myself that since this was my first new car I would treat it well.  That lasted for about 6 months.  I got a job working as a driving instructor and had to use my car.  Well, to make a long story short, I never had a accident...and over the course of the years I put 220,000 miles on the car...yes, 200,000 miles!!  I officially retired the car last year from business use, but i still use it for my personal car.  

The only problems I have had with the car itself was the half shafts failing...but that is a common repair as I found out..and with the number of miles piled on, it sped that process up.  My only real complaint about KIA is the availability of parts.  I was always having to go to the dealership for the parts.  And we all know that dealer parts are expensive!!  A couple of years ago I was told by my wonderful mechanic that the KIA was comparable to a Mazda Protege, as were most of the parts!!  I was using the parts with success, and I also found a great auto parts company that has everything you could possibly imagine for a great price!!  

If you own a KIA, or plan on owning a KIA you will find that only basic parts are available through retail auto parts stores.  You still have to go through the dealership for spark wires, brake pads and so forth.  I recently have needed to replace my brakes and rotors...first time for the rotors...and after finding out how much the dealership wanted just for the rotors turned my stomach and compelled me do a web search for parts.  I found a great company named USA Auto Parts...they had everything for a KIA, and for a great price.  For $200, which included shipping and handling charges, I was able to get two rotors, front pads, rear shoes and a set of spark wires.  The dealership would have cost me more than $200 for the rotors alone!!  

The car has held up real well over the miles, and I have experienced no major problems at all.  As long as you keep up with the preventative services and change the oil when you should, the car will last a long time!!  I would recommend a KIA to anyone who is looking for a good car that does well on mileage, and has a great price.  

I would not recommend taking a KIA on a cross country trip...KIA is not a nationwide distributor, and if you were to break down you would have a very hard time finding someone who could fix it, let alone get the parts for a fair price.  But if you are using it for in state travel or for a commuting car, it is the car for you.<br><br>
