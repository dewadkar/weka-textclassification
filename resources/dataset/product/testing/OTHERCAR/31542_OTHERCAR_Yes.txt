              After much research and deliberation, I bought this camera 1 year ago. After a busy year of holidays, parties and family events I can unreservedly recommend this camera to anyone who needs a good compact allrounder. 
  The image quality is comparable to a Minolta Vectis APS camera which we used previously, but, without any film development costs. 
  The only drawback to the whole experience is the low download speed to my PC via the parallel port link (no USB connection available). So much so that I bought a new printer which has a builtin Smartmedia port. Since then I have totally satisfied with my purchase.
  It is also very easy to carry being only slightly larger than a pack of king size cigarettes. The lens cover is built in so in is not necessary to use a case, a good idea that all manufacturers could do to follow.
  All in all a brilliant camera!<br><br>
