            Let me start off and say I am not a minivan kind of guy. However, minivans are a practical family vehicle.

<b>Exterior</b>

As far as minivans go, the MPV is a looker even without the optional packages that add the rear spoiler, or the chin spoiler and side skirts. It has a very clean appearance which is heightened by the fact that the sliding door rail is cleverly hidden along the bottom of the rear pop-out windows. Contrast this with some other minivans on the market that have a cutout in the sheet metal for this rail and you will know what I mean.

Only the ES trim gets 17 inch wheels, and it makes a difference. We purchased the LX with the 16 inch wheels. I recently had the opportunity to compare and contrast our LX against an ES on twisty mountain roads and the difference in grip is noticeable. If you are not prone to throw your minivan around in the twisties, you'll never notice the difference, but the 17 inch wheels do look and perform substantially better at the limits of the MPV's handling.

If you do not opt for the MPV's "magic" doors, the non-powered sliding doors are very light and easy to open and close. The rear liftgate is also easy to operate.

The gaping five point grille gives the MPV an aggressive look not found on any other minivan. Overall, the exterior is very eye-catching for a vehicle in which form is definitely following function.

<b> Interior </b>

The interior of the MPV comes in grey or tan, cloth or leather. Leather is only available on the ES model.

The captain's chairs for the driver and front passenger are quite comfortable, and provide the driver with seating that is high up. The benefit is an SUV-like commanding view of the road, with great visibility.

Initially I did not care for the gear selector lever, as it interferes with both radio operation and the wiper stalk. Also, the gear selection points for the lever are not intuitive, but you do get used to it over time.

It may be a little thing, but I really enjoy the foldaway tray table in between the passenger and driver seating. It allows for an extra drink holder as well as some useful temporary space for stowing sunglasses, maps, toys that are in timeout from your children, etc.

The storage bin in the center console is also excellent, allowing for storage of CDs and other assorted items. The coin tray in place of an ashtray holds several dollars worth of assorted coins and is large enough to accommodate spare change from several trips through the drive-thru or to provide enough for quite a few tolls.

There is also in-ceiling storage for sunglasses and for garage door openers.

The six disc changer is quite convenient to have in the dash, but the standard four speaker system is overwhelmed by the interior volume of the vehicle. The sound is adequate, but nothing special.

The mid-row seats are also captain's chairs, but with a twist. Like the Honda Odyssey, the MPV offers "side by slide" seating which allows the two middle captains chairs to become a bench seat for two. Only one chair moves (passenger side), but it also allows for easier access to the third row seating. I'll get to the third row seating shortly. Each sliding door has a cupholder that should easily hold the 1 liter drinks that are popular in 7-11 type stores. It is a deep cupholder, so it will also hold 12 ounce cans easily with no risk of spills. In the sliding captain's chair there is also a slide out tray with some more storage room (albeit small) and another cupholder. The middle passengers also benefit because the MPV is the only minivan to feature windows in the sliding doors that open. I have found this feature is of more benefit when the car is stopped to allow fresh air to circulate, as the wind noise with one or two of these windows open really causes some horrible wind noise that tears at your eardrums.

The third row bench seating is not going to be comfortable for cross country trips, but one look at the cargo area behind the third row  and it is easy to understand why. There simply isn't room for luggage for a long trip for 6-7 people in the rear. If you are looking for a vehicle to serve that purpose, you are better off looking at something like the Odyssey, a Grand Caravan, a Suburban or Expedition sized vehicle. The third row is perfectly adequate for two adults or three kids, and would be tolerable for drives up to about 5-7 hours at a stretch. The third row is comfortable enough for the day/weekend trip to the beach or the mountains. But wait, there's more. The third row can be folded to create a flat load floor (again like the Odyssey) and make an enormous amount of storage. Even better, the seat can be flipped around for tailgating, a feature the Odyssey lacks.

The trunk of the MPV is not large, but it is deep. With the third row up, there is plenty of room for groceries and around town shopping. There is enough room to pack bags for four travelers for a weekend if you stack the bags to the ceiling and restrict your ability to see what is behind you. However, if you are only taking four people, you can fold the rear seat flat and keep your rear visibility clear as well as have enough room for luggage for four for a week or two. With the rear seats folded, you can fit 4  golf bags side by side in the trunk. You could stack 16 golf bags easily, but where would they all sit?

Overall, the interior is comfortable and quiet. The design is well thought out and driver oriented. 

<b> Performance </b>

Previous MPVs had a lackluster 160HP engine that made driving tiresome, and the buzzing from the squirrels in the engine compartment was not tolerable.

The new 200 HP engine has remarkable response for a minivan, and the 5 speed automatic transmission is very smooth and never seems to hunt for the proper gear.

One aspect of the MPV's performance should grab your attention, and that is handling. I've already touched on the wheels in the exterior section, but keep this in mind when minivan shopping. Mazda engineers are suspension wizards. The MPV handles better than any minivan, bar none. The way the MPV weights and unweights in transition when turning exhibits an almost perfect balance. Given the weight of the vehicle, and the weight bias of front over rear and the fact that the MPV is front wheel drive, the handling is truly remarkable. I don't know that any minivan is truly "tossable" in the turns, but the MPV has imbued what could be a mundane ride with a suspension that makes driving an MPV fun.

<b> Conclusion </b>

I believe that Mazda has designed a "right-sized" minivan for a family of four. With the third seat folded down, there is a huge cargo area. When family is in town, you can carry up to 6 passengers comfortably, seven if you put 3 kids in the third row. 

Mazda is making great strides to establish the brand as affordable performance, and the MPV fits nicely in that scheme as a sporty minivan.

Overall, a great ride at a reasonable price.
