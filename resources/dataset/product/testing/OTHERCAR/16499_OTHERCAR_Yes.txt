            My little dream car is a 1997 BMW 318i.  I leased this car used with about 12,000 miles on it and have loved it from the second I drove it off the lot.  BMW definitely makes driver comfort a top priority.  After a car history of inexpensive american models, driving this little beemer has spoiled me.

This car has too many extras to list but a few of my favorites are one touch windows, easy to operate controls for a/c and radio, multi-positioning seat for driver and passenger, very roomy backseat, and more.  The ultimate feature for the forgetful mommy is the cars ability to raise windows and close the sunroof when the key is engaged to lock the doors.  Just a quick hold in the locked position and the windows and sunroof are automatically closed.  The BMW 318i drives like a charm handling corners so tight you can forget you ever learned a 3 point turn because you'll never need to use one!  Even with a 4 cylinder engine, this car has the umph and speed of a 6 cylinder.

Most BMW's come with a higher sticker price but finding this used model helped me lease an affordable luxury car.  I recommend considering the purchase of any model BMW if its in your price range for you will never tire of the driving ease and comfort features BMW has to offer.  <br><br>
