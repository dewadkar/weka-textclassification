            I bought my E320 AWD in January 1998 but had to wait until May for delivery. The new M-series trucks/SUV's had just come out and had placed such a demand on the all-wheel-drive drive train that back-orders were the only way to get the vehicle.

The wait was worth it. I planned a 1000 mile road trip soon after receiving the car, so I could stretch it's legs and get a feel for what it was like on long drives. And it was a dream.

The E320 AWD is a driver's car. You have to love to drive to love this car. Don't buy it otherwise! It's feel for the road is like nothing you've ever felt. You know the bump is there, but it doesn't crush you. The turn is there, but there there is no sway. The brakes are there. They simply stop the vehicle. The doors close like a jar seal. the auto-up-and-down windows for ALL windows is a sensible option that I wonder why GM/Ford/Chrysler (when I have to rent for business) never thought to add.

I've clocked just over 40,000 miles since I bought the machine and people look at the automobile as if it was new off the lot. I've been to the dealer for a a few parts I've broken, but regular service costs in for those 3 year and 40,000 still total less than $1000. In fact, the first service check (at 12,000 miles! Yes, no oil change for 12,000 miles!!) was free!! I drop by the dealer, who replaces headlamps, etc. for free. (I wonder when that courtesy stops?)

The AWD adds a dimension of road feel that you just can't get with a 2-wheel drive car of any sort. You accelerate through turns, you don't slow down. I call this a "point and shoot" car. You point the car where you want to go .. and it goes! Road feel is unbelievable!

The cons. There are few. My wife complains of the simplicity of the car and the seat on long road trips. The integrated cell phone, despite claims of the sales rep, was analog and costs me a fortune to keep in service. And lastly, it wasn't cheap. Having owned an Acura Legend before, which was a VERY good car, I thought the experience could not be surpassed. But it was!
