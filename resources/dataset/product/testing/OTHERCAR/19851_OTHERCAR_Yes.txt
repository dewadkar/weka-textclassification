            I recently purchased a 99 Chevy S-10.  Basically its stripped not equipped.  I bought the vehicle because I like the overall design of the truck.  At the time I opted for the model without the options because I did not think that it would make that much difference.  Since then I find myself wishing I had bucket seats and better wheels.  The bottom of the line factory wheels are not attractive, and the higher priced models look completely different just because of the wheels.  My truck would look totally different if I upgraded the wheels, but the manufacturer does not allow you to purchase the wheels seperately.  Best bet I have found is to go to a junk yard and get the wheels for about 200 bucks.  Otherwise the truck is great.  Runs well and has a decent amount of power for a four cylinder.  One other thing I don't like is that you cant ever turn the headlights off.  They are on from the minute you release the parking brake to the time you turn off the truck..day or night.  Thats all.  <br><br>
