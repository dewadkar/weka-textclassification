            The 1998 Toyota Corolla LE is definitely the best car I have ever owned (or leased, rather!). My new Toyota Corolla had just 22 miles on it when I started my lease, back in the summer of 1998. It is by far the most reliable car I have ever had. (I have owned a Dodge Shadow, VW Rabbit, Nissan Sentra, Chevy Nova, and Chevy Malibu.)

Granted, the car is only three years old, but the only things I have had done to it are the basic maintenance things that any car needs. NOTHING has ever needed to be repaired, except a flat tire due to running over a nail. The car is a dream! It provides reliable, fairly stylish and very comfortable transportation. It does not demand constant attention from you, (almost none, in my case) and gets decent gas mileage. My Toyota Corolla LE has traveled across the country from Virginia  to California, over a 7- day period during the hottest months of summer. The air conditioner performed like a champ, nice and cold, even though it was over 100 degrees outside in some states! 

My 3 year car lease will be over in July 2001, and I will be very sad to turn my car in. (Yes, I could buy it, but I do not want another 4 to 5 years of car payments, since I am now a college student, so I will be buying an older used Toyota Corolla.) This car has exceeded my expectations for reliable, stylish transportation with good gas mileage. I recommend this car to everyone who wants a great reliable car that you will not have to worry about.
