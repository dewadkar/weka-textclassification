                This car is probably one of the strongest cars, I have riden in. I like this car not only because it has a big engine, but because it is very roomy in the front and in the back. This Truck I am talking about is a 1500 SERIES GMC Sierra, with a V8 327, fuel injected. I really like this car and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be up high. It has been proven that cars that are higher, are more safe. It has pretty good gas mileage and it only cost about $27 to fill it up and only about a hundred dollars a month.   <br><br>
