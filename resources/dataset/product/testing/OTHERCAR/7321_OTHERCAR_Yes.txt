            I purchased my Olympus D-460 eight months ago now, and I've used it very frequently during this time. It's taken some wonderful pictures, largely due to the fact I can carry it anywhere as it is portable enough to place in my pocket.

The feature-set of the camera is excellent with flash options, resolutions variations, 'burst mode' (taking many pictures in a three second burst) and other facilities. This, combined with the 3x optical zoom, make the camera a very decent buy at �310 ($453). I was looking for a well-specified camera with my limited student budget for a first digital camera, and I found all my needs met by the Olympus D460. Only the inability to transfer images via USB makes me fault this camera, but then I knew this when I bought it. This can be overcome by purchasing a SmartMedia card-reader for your PC (but it'll cost you �30).

I will undoubtedly need to buy a new one soon (next Summer) as increased resolution becomes available at a decreased price, but for my first digital camera (bought back in May) this was an excellent deal. <b>Perhaps eight months on though, one should look for USB support and maybe 2 Megapixel resolution.<b><br><br>
