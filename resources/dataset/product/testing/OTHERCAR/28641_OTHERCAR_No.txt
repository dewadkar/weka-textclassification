            Let me start out by saying that I bought this camera for $179 refurbished in an online auction. My expectations were not that high. What I got pretty much was inline with those low expectations. Let's start with the cons since they come to mind first.

CONS:

Big problems with batteries. The batteries that came with the camera managed to end my playful 3 hour break-in period. When I took the batteries out they were HOT. The next day, they worked in the camera just fine. I guess if you need to use the camera for more than a few hours straight, you would need spare batteries to swap in eventhough the original batteries still have juice in them. I guess the camera just gets them too hot to be useful. Also, the camera doesnt seem to like certain, less powerful batteries, and can act strangely when they are used.

Close-ups are a no-go. The lens has a focus limit of 2.23 to 10 feet I believe. Meaning you cant get any closer than 2 feet or everything gets blurred. This can be corrected by spending $40 on close-up lenses, but why should that be a solution that needs to be paid for?

If there is a way to adjust the shutter speed, I havent found it. As it is, the shutter speed is way too slow and if your hand happens to not be completely still when you're taking a picture of something up close, blur-o-rama.

The viewfinder is way off-center compared to the lens. This means that pictures get cropped close-up, and need to be adjusted for by awkwardly aiming the viewfinder to keep what should be in the picture, in the picture.

The flash and LED are not practical because they use up battery power extremely quickly.

4 megabyte picture card is a tad small. 8 megs would have been much better.

The LED is not really bright enough to read in sunlight.

Transfers to computers via a serial port are slow.

The software that comes with the camera is useful, but REALLY limited.

PROS:

Fits comfortably in the hand. Seems to be designed so that stray fingers stay out of pictures, and so far it seems to be working.

The camera is easy to use overall. There are not tons of complicated menus or combinations of buttons that need to be pushed. A quick look at the instructions and some experimentation should result in being able to handle this camera like an expert.

High image compression on this camera is very good, and generally the 4 meg picture card will hold 15 or 16 high resolution pictures instead of the 12 it is supposed to be capable of.

In high resolution, best quality, with a flash, the pictures look VERY good, colors are excellent, vibrant even. Low resolution pictures at best quality are still acceptible, and are very useful because 25-30 pictures of that sort are able to fit onto the 4 meg picture card.

There are tons of accessories available through Kodak for this camera which, for a price, enable you to turn this camera into what you wish it was out of the box.

CONCLUSION:

Overall, I wouldn't say that the Kodak DC200plus is a BAD camera for the price, it's just not a GREAT one, and therein lies the problem.
