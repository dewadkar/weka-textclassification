            I purchased my 1st digital camera a few months ago, (Olympus 360L) it was a great little unit for knocking around and snapping pictures at the beach and so forth. But it was lacking in close-up pictures. So after a month I went back to my local camera shop, when I left it there was a new Olympus D-460 under my arm. The D-460 has all the features I love about my 360L and a whole lot more. It is the same 1.3 megapixel quality and it's a 3X zoom too! If you are looking for a camera that will go with you anywhere and be ready when you need it to be, then this is the one you want. The only drawback I can point out is the power issue. As with any digital camera, the D-460 will eat batteries fast than kids go through Milk and Cereal. But that is a small inconvenience to put up with for the fantastic time you will have with this camera. Any novice shutterbug or even a seasoned Photo Animal will ejoy this camera, FIVE STARS!! <br><br>
