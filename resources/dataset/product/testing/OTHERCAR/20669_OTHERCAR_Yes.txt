            Let me start by saying, we have had audi since 1988. They are grat cars. Now I am not saying that cars like Mercedes or BMW are not good cars they just are not like the audi since damiyler-chrysler bought mercedes they just have not been the same high quality elicte craftman ship. For one lets compare the BMW 740IL to the Audi, not only is audi slightly under priced to the BMW. The audi A8 has all wheel drive, which is a big plus back in the east with all the snow. It is roomy not as roomey as the BMW but very close to it with the features the audi has like the &quot;special lights&quot; it has and the rear automatic cover so the sun doesent burn the back of your neck. The sound system is unbeliveable crisp sound like a stratvarous, and the leather is jsut georgous. You will not be let down with this car. Also it is very reasonbaly prices the way luxury cars go.
