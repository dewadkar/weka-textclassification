            our first new car purchase was a '95 subaru impreza purchased in 11/94 .. yeah we had bought new trucks before but with the added distance we had been traveling we thought we would try a car .. but we were still in need of a 4x4 so we thought we would try a subaru ... well we just loved it that year we traveled all over.  even made a trip to NH and drove it up MT WASHINGTON ... I highly recomend these cars .. ours was a station wagon , 5 spd manual ... they are great .. but boy have they improved to the eye over the years ... 
if anyone is in the market for a reliable 4x4 that can haul the family  without breaking the bank these are the cars for you  ..
 other than oil,tires,gas , and wiper blades ... 
we did very little maintenance to it in the 94,000 miles we had it ...
 we even bought a second subaru in 11/95 this time a legacy LS ... which you will have to read about in my other opinion ... so i say hi ho by a subaru ,,, they wear like iron ... :)<br><br>
