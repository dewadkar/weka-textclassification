            A 1987 2 door Olds Firenza was my first car.  I worked all summer, saved up and bought this car in 1994 with 80,000 miles for $3000.  

It was as close to a base model Firenza as you could get.  Inside it had crank down windows, no power door locks, no tilt wheel, AM/FM radio without cassette.  It did have air conditioning, which did work well.  The seats were surprisingly comfortable for such a small car.  It had two bucket seats in the front, which were fairly firm.  There was no cupholders, or armrest between the front seats.  This car would not be your first choice to travel long distances in.  If you were going to use it for commuting the Firenza will be adequate there.  The back seat was very difficult to get into, this is to be expected with such a small car.  The Firenza is basically the same car as the Cavalier, or Sunbird of the same year.  Once in the back seat there is suprisingly a lot of leg room, adequate for me at 6' tall.  

The car was powered by a 2.0 4cylinder engine.  This was the base engine in this car and was fairly peppy for such a small engine.  This was helped along by a 5-speed manual transmission.  By having the stick shift gas mileage was great!  About 38 hwy and 33 in town.  With a 12 gallon gas tank you could expect to go over 400 miles.  This was a great feature for a high school student with very little money.  

The car was fairly reliable for the mileage on it.  This was a 16 year old guys first car, so it wasn't always driven with TLC, but it held out very well.  It had 80,000 when I bought it.  I had a water pump go out and a head gasket go out on it.  Some things to be expected at the mileage it was at.  

One other problem I've noticed with many Firenza's is rust.  The one I had, had very little rust on it.  Many of them that I see on the road are very rusty.  I live in a northern climate that uses salt and sand on the roads, so many cars of this age are rusty, but the Firenza seems to be worse than many others.

All in all it was a fun, tough little car for a new driver.  

IF, and that is a big IF, you find a Firenza in decent shape, it is worth taking a look at.
