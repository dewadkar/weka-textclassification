            Canon's PowerShot S10 is a great value.  My friend and I both purchased the same camera.  Our thinking was that the most important reason to buy a digital camera was the ability to take over a hundred shots without reloading.  This is one of the few consumer cameras that support the IBM MicroDrive, which allows for at least 300+ exposures.

Although it is only a 2.1 megapixel camera, unless you are a professional, you should not require print quality images that don't even fit on a floppy disk.  For maximum enjoyment, though, I'd recommend the purchase of an IBM MicroDrive as well as at least two NiMH rechargeable batteries to avoid having to buy any additional accessories, such as regular batteries, later.

The only disadvantage, in my opinion, is that the setup sequence is rather slow.  This is primarily due to the fact that the camera lens has a built-in lens cover that needs to be extruded and retracted when you use it and put it away, respectively.  This is common in a standard non-digital point-and-shoot, so it may not be a problem for many consumers.  But don't be expecting to whip out the camera to snap a quick shot in a hurry.<br><br>
