            I have owned a 2003 Subaru Forester XS since October 2002. Since then it has had problems with the ABS (three trips to dealer), No-Start condition (two trips to dealer) and the A/C (one trip to dealer). There is also intermittent noise from the front end, but I cannot reproduce it for the dealer.

Hey, &^%% happens, but what is really disappointing is how the car handles off pavement. I live in Northern Canada and was expecting amazing control. Not with the stock tires - the first week of snow had me all over the road. I have driven RWD and FWD cars up here for twenty five years and only a VW Golf with fat, slick tires was harder to keep on the road. I put on four Toyo winter tires and that fixed things up a little.

I am a good, but not expert driver. What happens is the rear-end wants to come around on corners and when slowing down. The whole car is "twitchy" on snow. Maybe I liked the dead ride of an FWD car - it may not be going exactly where you wanted it, but at least you knew where it was going. This Subaru seems like it needs a rally driver to maximize speed around corners by hanging the tail out. I admit that's fun, but not when I am tired and on a busy road.

The other thing that is disappointing is the power and fuel economy. I joke that this car has all the power of a Toyota Corolla and the gas mileage of a Dodge Ram truck. Even on highway runs I am challenged to get less than 10 liters per 100 kilometers (sorry non-metric folks). This is about 40% worse than the claimed mileage. Passing requires the "slingshot" technique honed in my 65 HP Honda Civic - certainly not what I would expect from a CDN$29,000 car.

I keep waiting for it to get better, but it doesn't.
