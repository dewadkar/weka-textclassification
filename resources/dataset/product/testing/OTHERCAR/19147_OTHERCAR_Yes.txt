            I am not the type to buy in to all sorts of stereo types but one that I have found to be pretty accurate, at least in my own experience, is that women are not good drivers.  In particular, my wife has a tough time behind the wheel.  Its not for a lack of effort or anything like that, its just that she lacks the eye-hand coordination that make me the force to be reckoned with that I am  on the highways.  Therefore, when our son was born, the thought of the two of them driving around in our Jetta with all of those SUV monsters on the road scared the hell out of me.  Not that the Jetta isn't a fantastic car, I just thought we needed something a bit bigger.  

So we said goodbye to our Jetta of four years and purchased (actually I leased it) a 1999 Volkswagen Passat Wagon.  This car rules.  Since the Wagon was in Michigan and we are in Chicago, the dealer loaned me a car for a few days while the wagon was transported.  The car he loaned me was a Passat as well but it was the Sedan with a V6.  The Wagons (at least in the US) do not have the V6 option.  So I was a little afraid that after cruising around in the V6 for a few days, the wagon would seem a bit pokey. This was not the case at all.  Not only did the wagon ride every bit as smooth and sturdy as the sedan, it was NOT noticeably slower.  Thats because this baby is packing a turbo 4 cylinder in-line love machine.  This is the same engine thats in the new turboniums (turbo beetles).  The full power of this engine can really be felt when driven with the Tiptronic option that lets the driver shift gears manually.  This option in essence makes the car both a stick and an automatic.

I really can't say enough good things about this car.  It is the perfect choice for anyone that wants to get a little more space without feeling like a dork.  This is not your moms wagon with the wood paneling on the side.  Furthermore, it makes me feel better knowing that my wife and child are as safe as my current income can make them.
