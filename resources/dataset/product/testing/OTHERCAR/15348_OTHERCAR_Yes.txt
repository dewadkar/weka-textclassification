            I waited a long time to buy a digital camera.  I read all the reviews in PC Computing and PC World about which camera to buy and it always came back to the Sony.  I looked at the prices and said I'm going to wait because they will come down.  But how long do you wait?

The price is high compared to the other cameras out there but the pros out weigh the cons and if you wait you miss out on a lot of cute pictures you could be sharing with friends and family right now.

First I bought the HP Camera from Best Buy for 499.00.  But all the extras that you had to buy to use the camera slowly added up to the price of the Sony.  First the camera = 499.00, then the extra parts needed to read the mini disk in your computer  =  99.00, then you needed batteries, (it came with 4 double A's) but when I used the camera for less than an hour, the batteries were dead and the instruction booklet said you had to replace all 4 batteries even if only one went bad.  That added up....  Next trying to find the adapter to use, which you had to have to download the pictures, was next to impossible.  Best Buy did not carry it but told me if I went to a store in the nearby mall they would have it.... NOT......  So I took it back and traded it for the Sony.... which I should have bought in the first place because Best Buy charged me 45.00 to return the HP.  

So back to the Sony....
This is the best camera for the money.  Even though it cost 699.00 it was only 200.00 more in the long run, because you did not have to buy anything extra to read the 3 1/2 floppy disks.  The camera came with a battery that lasts for over 120 minutes on a full charge.  You can charge that battery over and over again.  I am having trouble finding the adapter for it also but so far I have been able to use the battery as long as I've needed too.  A new charge takes an hour, and the charger comes with the camera.  Too bad the adapter isn't part of the camera package.

Great job Sony, this is the easiest camera I've ever used....
