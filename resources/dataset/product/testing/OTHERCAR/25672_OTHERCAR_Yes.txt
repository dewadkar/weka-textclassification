            I bought this car in 1995, and I've never had any problems with it at all. It still runs and looks just like new. I bought the car because it had excellent reviews in all the consumer reports I read, and I fell in love with it when I test drove it. It was also an excellent value. Another bonus is that it is quite spacious compared to other cars in its class. I'm pretty tall, and I often find some compact cars don't have a lot of head room, but this car has plenty. It also gets pretty good gas mileage (even more important now that gas prices are so high!) <br><br>
