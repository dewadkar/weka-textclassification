            Never heard of the Leganza? Or even Daewoo? The Leganza is the top-line model from Daewoo Motor America, which is a subsidiary of the Daewoo Group--a giant South Korean industrial firm. Besides the Leganza, Daewoo will offer the lower-priced Lanos and Nubira autos in this country. Daewoo Motor said its cars will start at approximately $9,000, and that the Leganza will cost from $15,000 to $20,000. Cars from South Korea once were marginal and didn't have much success in the United States. But Daewoo did its homework with the front-wheel-drive Leganza, which qualifies as a mid-size car because of its 105.1-inch wheelbase and roomy interior. The old fashioned hood prop rod should be replaced by hydraulic struts, but Daewoo generally has come up with a very sound car that will sell for less than many rivals.
