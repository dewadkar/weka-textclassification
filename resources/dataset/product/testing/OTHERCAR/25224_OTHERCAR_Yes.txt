            I bought a Dodge ram v-10 back in 1994, the second they came out.  This is by far the best truck I have ever owned in my life.  The only drawback is the gas mileage, 11 miles to the gallon is not the best.  This truck has amazing power, more than any other truck I have ever seen.  <br>I recently was driving in the mountains when I came across two trucks, a Ford, and a Chevy, they had just cut this massive spruce tree down, they had both tried to pull it out, even both vehicles at once, with no luck.  They then asked me to give it a whirl, so we hooked the rope up.  The truck spun a bit, but it only took two good tugs and the tree slid out easily. They were both amazed in the Dodge's power, just like I had been.  The guy who owned the Ford also bought a Dodge two years after the incident, and the funny thing was, it's identical to mine.  <br><br>The only thing I wish I would have done differently is get the diesel, I have drove my friends and everything seems about the same, including power, and the gas mileage is a lot better.  This vehicle is perfect for just about anyone, it's great for all of them avid sportsmen, and is also great for women, since it is very easy to drive.<br><br><br><br>
