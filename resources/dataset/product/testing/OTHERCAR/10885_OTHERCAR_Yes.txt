            **Update at Bottom**
I've always wanted a digital camera. They are great if you like taking pictures without the hassle of film or waiting for them to be developed. If you arenï¿½t pleased with a picture, simply delete it. 

The Panasonic PV-DC2590 1.3 megapixel camera is certainly not a toy. It has a nice selection of features such as its 1.8" LCD viewfinder screen which makes it easy to see exactly what you are capturing and have captured. It also allows you to navigate through the numerous settings in each mode. It also features an Optical Viewfinder for saving battery life. 

As for power consumption, this camera eats up batteries like potato chips. It runs off of 4 "AA" batteries. The batteries supplied with the camera didn't stand a chance. It would be pointless to buy massive amounts of batteries for this camera. The best advice I would give everyone using high tech devices like these would be to buy yourself a nice rechargeable battery charger with an extra set of rechargeable batteries (so you always have a charged set on hand), preferably Ni-Cd or *Ni-MH*, as I did. They last just as long or even longer than standard batteries and you can use them over and over again. In order to preserve battery life, you may wish to shut the display off and use the optical viewfinder and/or simply put the camera into standby mode for short periods of time when not using it. 

This camera produces nice, clear images even in normal mode. It features 3 different image quality modes: Normal, Fine and Super Fine. It also has a zoom mode, 4 second motion image recording and a burst record mode. 

With the supplied 8MB flash card, you can capture (All Approximations): 15 images in Super Fine Mode, 30 in Fine, 100 in Normal, 100 in Zoom Mode, 6 in Motion Recording and 100 in Burst Record mode. 

This camera transfers information via serial I/O port on your computer. It can be kind of time consuming whereas super fine images take about a minute each to download. It also features a compact modem card where you can transfer images over the phone or even operate the camera over great distances! I have yet to use this feature nor plan on ever using it. 

Some other standout features of this camera include a B/W LCD Indicator Panel which displays battery status, images left and lots more, 3x optical zoom, 10 second self-timer with flashing LED, and TV-out.

-Some things I don't like about this camera is the long delay when pressing the shutter button to take a picture. You can miss a lot because of this. When my sister tried the camera out for the first time, the first thing she spoke out about was the long delay and how she missed her test shots. In general, the camera's functions are also slow (responding). 
-I'd say the camera eats up batteries fast, but i cant compare because i haven't had any other cameras.
-The zoom on it is kinda noisy and flimsy sounding.
-The battery door is hard to close and takes some practice to get used to. The first time I tried to close it with batteries in, I thought i had the batteries in wrong. Then when i made sure they were in right, the amount of pressure required to close it felt like it would snap.
-Serial (i/o) transfer is slow and outdated...transfer errors occurred frequently.

(3/8/01 Update):
As of today (3/18/01) I have returned the Panasonic DC-2590 in hope of purchasing a better camera. It wasn't a bad camera, but I was looking for a higher image quality than 1.3 megapixel and USB transfer. I am set on the Kodak DC4800 Zoom, a more professional camera, which I will be reviewing soon.
