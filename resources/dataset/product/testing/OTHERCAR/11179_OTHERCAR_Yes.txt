            We are a growing family of 5 and had tolerated our car for as long as we could. Last fall I decided it was finally time to purchase our first minivan. I decided to buy my Previa because it was rated excellent overall in some consumer polls and I trust the Toyota name. Toyota is long known for building reliable vehicles that can go the distance and then some.
 My van was used but had only 43,000 miles on it and is in excellent condition. You can tell that whoever owned it before me loved it as much as I do. I was impressed during the test drive. It is very roomy and rides quietly and comfortably. It has more leg room than some of the newer minivans on the market. The interior is ultra modern and durable as well as attractive and rich looking. I wasn't too happy about the exterior &quot;egg&quot; shape of the van but it has grown on me and I love it. The turning radius is awesome. It can turn tighter corners than some of the compact cars I have owned!  The fuel economy isn't that bad, about 20 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway.  It has a 4 cylinder engine that would be underpowered if not for the super charger. Because of the supercharger I have no complaints about passing on the highway.
 It is well equipped with lots of options. My Previa has a CD/tape player, rear AC and rear heat and lots of cargo space in back. The middle seats swivel and the back seats split and fold flat against the sides for extra cargo space. I absolutely love my Previa and know that I made a great choice. I am disappointed that Toyota discontinued this model because it is roomier than their new minivan. <br><br>
