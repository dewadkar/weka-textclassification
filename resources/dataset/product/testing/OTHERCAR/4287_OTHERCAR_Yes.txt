               As a past owner/lover of multiple VW's over the years, I had been waiting for the return of the Beetle.  I expected a good, economical vehicle...but nothing so refined and exceptional as what VW has delivered.  This car rocks!   I love everything about the car except the price...you definitely pay for the cool factor that this car delivers.   
   Being a big tree-hugger, I passed on the gas turbo and went for the diesel.   No regrets there, as the diesel is peppier than many gasoline cars I have driven, and I'm getting 52mpg!   I go about 550 miles between fill-ups, and diesel averages right at the price of regular unleaded, so I'm saving some serious bucks.
   This car handles like a dream.  The low-profile, wide (P235!) tires put lots of rubber on the road...it is totally solid in cornering in any kind of weather.   The ABS disk brakes on all four wheels get me stopped in no time.  No doubt about it, VW delivers on the handling they promise in their TV commercials.
   Inside, I got the leather package...very nice.  When I first saw that I had heated seats I just chuckled...but on the first cold morning my attitude changed completely.   Seat heaters rule!  The Bug is loaded with features like that.
   The Bug has front and side airbags.   Those side air-bags add a lot to the feeling of security I have driving this car.   The New Beetle is nothing like the old ones, much as I love them.  It's a safe, solid, modern car in every way.
   There is one thing about the car that takes some getting used to.   You sit very far back behind the giant dash, and the A-pillars are way out front.   The Bug doesn't have any more of a blind spot than any other car, but it's in a different place than you're accustomed to.   It takes a while to get a feel for where the front bumper is when you're parking and such.   These aren't problems, but if you test-drive the car you may notice them and be a bit uncomfortable.   After one day with my new Bug it was other cars that seemed odd to me.
    As for who should consider buying this car, I would answer anybody who loves fun!   This car does attract attention, and nobody confuses it with anything else on the road.   It's a genuine driver's car...something you can take out on the road just for the joy of it.   It's all that, and yet with the excellent quality and the economy of the diesel (if you pick that) it's a good choice even if you just drive it to work.   It should get you there reliably, cheaply - and with style - for many years.
