            Post script to &quot;Not So Sporty&quot;.  Our 99 Forester S has caused us to have three near accidents.  The occasional stuttering when trying to acceleration left my wife at the mercy of the brakes of the other driver, nearly being hit on three separate occasions.  After ten visits to two dealers and correspondence to Subaru of North America we were no better off than when our troubles began.  One dealer identified a fault in a throttle position sensor and a fault in a torque sensor neither of which they would replace under warrantee saying that both faults couldn't show up at the same time.  After numerous test drives all the mechanic and area representative would say was that our vehicle drives &quot;normally&quot;.

Convinced the transmission was a one time fluke of manufacturing we went to trade our unsafe vehicle for a new one.  We sat in a 2001 S+ and noticed the glove box had a sizable gap between the top of the box and the dash.  When asked the dealer said that this was &quot;normal&quot;.  Sure enough 4 of 5 cars had similar anomalies.  What is &quot;NORMAL&quot; to Subaru?  I know this is just one small example of quality workmanship but after our other problems we are looking for a nice used Volvo.

I will say the amenities of the 2001 are nice.  The many upgrades to equipment make the 2001 a good purchase if you are willing to take the chance that you got a car that isn't a product of Subaru's recent poor quality workmanship.  GOOD LUCK!<br><br>
