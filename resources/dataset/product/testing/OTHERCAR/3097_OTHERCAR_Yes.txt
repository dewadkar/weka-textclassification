            I bought a 2000 Hyundai Elantra last month and I could not be happier.  This is my first new car and an excellent choice in my opinion.

My husband and I took an unplanned car shopping trip one day in July.  We test drove a Nissan Sentra first and we were not impressed with the car or the dealer.  Next we drove to the Hyundai dealership, with me protesting the whole way.  I was sure I wasn't going to like them, I mean really, a Hyundai!!  Much to my surprise I really like the Elantra we drove and told my husband I wanted it.  

The Elantra we drove had everything I wanted except a CD player, so when we got back to the lot we looked around to see if we could find one.  There it was, with a CD player, rear spoiler, and a sunroof, I was in love.  We told the salesman we wanted to talk price and I fell deeper in love when he came back with a price.

I chose the 4 door Elantra with CD, spoiler, sunroof, power windows and locks and a 2.0 liter engine, with a gas mileage of 28/31(SIGH).  The sticker price was $14,951, the salesman came back with $12,898 and a $750 rebate!  He explained they don't work on commission so there are no price games.  I drove home that night in my new &quot;Race Car&quot;, this is what my three year old calls it.

One month later I am still thrilled.  I drive about 18 miles one way to work each day on the most dangerous highway in Florida, three lanes but I also have 18 stoplights, and I still got over 300 miles on a tank of gas, with the a/c cranked.  It is surprisingly quiet for a 4 cylinder and gives a smooth ride.  It is also pretty roomy in the front and back seats.  My husband keeps saying he would have bought it for himself.

I did have a problem after about two weeks, it stalled and bucked a lot.  When I called, the dealership(Fitzgeralds Hyundai) explained some models had a bad oxygen sensor and told me to bring it in the next day(Sunday) and they would give me a loaner vehicle.  I did just that and my car was fixed by 11am on Monday.  I was very impressed with the &quot;service after the sale&quot;.

I highly recommend the Elantra to anyone shopping for a new car.  It is a great car at a great price with the best warranty, 5/60,000 bumper to bumper and 10/100,000 powertrain.
