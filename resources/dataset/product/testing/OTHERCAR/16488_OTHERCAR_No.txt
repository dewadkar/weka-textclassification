            My last minivan was a Plymouth and it held up fairly well to the test of a 3 child family, but in September of 2001 we decided it was time to trade in the old minivan and seek something a little more dependable. 

My father has always been a GM fan and I guess I fell for that father knows best thing when he told me I should look at that Silhouette by Oldsmobile.  My wife and I looked at Chevy, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile.  The Silhouette appeared to be a step above all of them.  We loved the premiere edition which was the top of the line model of Silhouette.  It was sleek, stylish, comfortable, and had all of the features that would make it perfect for our family, leather interior (easy to clean), built in entertainment center (no more "are we there yets" on those long trips), rear heat (keeps the kids cozy), and even seat warmers (to keep mom from complaining on those Ohio winter days).  What I can say really sold us on this van though was the 5 year 60,000 mile warranty that was exclusive to the Olds since it is nearing the end of production.  Everything appeared wonderful as we drove it off the lot and home to our garage.

We had the van for approximately 2 weeks when my daughter reported that they were getting no sound from the headsets when the entertainment center was on.  We took the van to our dealer who assured us that this would be fixed.  When we returned to pick up the van they assured us that they had tested all 4 headsets and it worked.  When I got in it I noticed that 2 of the headsets were still in the plastic and my daughter stated that it still didn't work.  The dealer kept the van for another day ripped a control unit from another brand new 2002 and put it into mine.  This was of course covered under warranty, but not the end of my problems.

As you all probably know, the worst time to own a vehicle is right after a warranty expires around 36,000 miles.  Well my van went in at 37,000 miles because the brake light was coming on.  The list of things that the dealer found was staggering.  Master cylinder needed replaced, 2 wheel cylinders needed replaced, wheel bearing was loose, tie rod arm was loose, all 4 tires, and new brake pads.  We of course were responsible for the tires and brakes even after my protest that the tie rod and wheel bearing surely caused the tires to wear prematurely the GM protection plan covered the rest.  After this we had the van home exactly 1 week when my wife noticed water dripping from the overhead console, the thermometer was reading 107 degrees on a day where it was 25 degrees, the seat warmers wouldn't heat up, the air conditioner wasn't cold and the driver side power door would bounce back from time to time. 

We took the Olds back in and they replaced the main console due to a leak in a seal over the windshield, they also replaced the heaters in the seats, the AC condenser, and adjusted the doors.  2 days later, the brake light is on again and it's back at the shop for the second time for the same problem.

I'm frightened at what the future holds for this $30,000+ purchase.  GM used to make a quality vehicle, but at this point I'm beginning to think that those days are gone.

*Update*  I just had to add this.  A week after replacing the master cylinder again due to faulty parts (At least the dealer said this), the brake light is on again.  It goes back to the shop for the 3rd time tomorrow for the same problem!
