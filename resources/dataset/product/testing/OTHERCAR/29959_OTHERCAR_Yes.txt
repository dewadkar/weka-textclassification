            I bought my wife a 2000 Grand Caravan Sport back in January, 2000.  I wanted her to get an Excursion (see my review), but she refused to drive it every day, so I dumped my 1998 F-150 for the Excursion, and bought her the Caravan.

In today's market for new vehicles, financing rates are a major force in decision making.  I was able to take advantage of 0.9% over 5 years, on top of a great deal from the Dodge dealer.  Unfortunately, I let the deal and the financing cloud some of my better judgement.  Don't get me wrong;  the Caravan is a nice vehicle, but there are some things missing that I have come to expect from previous vehicles I have purchased (four others, all Fords).

If I realized some of these earlier, I would have been harder on the dealer, but probably still would have bought the Caravan.  The four things that bug me the most are:

Pickup:
The 3.3L V-6 dogs it.  Turn on the AC, and I am looking for the bicycle peddles!

Interior lighting:
For the price paid, there should be more illumination.  The cruise buttons and the power window buttons are not lit.  I have been driving (and still am) Fords, so I have their buttons memorized (even though THEY are illuminated).  When I drive the Caravan, I am always having to turn on the dome light to see the dog-gone buttons.  And this is a high-end Caravan!

Controls:
Instead of having idiot-proof knobs for AC/Vent/Defrost with abbreviations such as AC, Vent, Def, there are separate push-buttons with pictures on them.  This is not very friendly to me.  Then, if there is a drink in the dashboard cupholder, you cannot access the temperature or fan knob to adjust!

Driving lights:
Many years ago, I used to add aftermarket halogen fog lamps to my vehicles.  They would be invaluable when driving in the Pocono Mountains in fog or snow.  These lights do not add the same benefits and are of no value.  The only thing they really do is aggravate an on-coming driver, since they are only on when the low beams are on.  I do not have them on the vehicle I drive.  I just curse every time a vehicle comes in the other direction with the driving lights on, blinding me.

All in all, the Grand Caravan Sport is a good car.  My wife drives it 95% of the time, and she does not complain.  It gets OK gas mileage (approx. 18.5 MPG), it handles great, and there is plenty of room for three kids and the normal junk they carry.<br><br>
