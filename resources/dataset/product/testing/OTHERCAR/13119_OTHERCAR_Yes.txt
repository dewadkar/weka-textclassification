            A year ago we purchased a loaded 1999 LTZ Lumina and have not regretted it.  We looked at a lot of other GM products including the Malibu and the Impala both of which were disappointments.  I was considering the Buick Regal but couldn't afford the sticker price.  One day I came across our Lumina being sold as a demonstrator and when the salesman showed me the 3800 series II, V6 under the hood I was sold.  This car is a powerful, sporty four door that is great for the family and the &quot;Tim Taylor&quot; in your family.  It feels like a full size ever though it is more like a mid-size car.  There is lots of interior ergonomic space and features, but it could be a few inches wider inside, like the older model Luminas.

One of the drawbacks of a car with a sports suspension is it's stiff ride.  The Goodyear Eagle 225 60 16 tires are great for cornering but tend to slap even the small road bumps.  The car is great up here in the Canadian winters and travels through snow easily.  I also like the gas mileage for a car with this much horsepower.  We have taken it to Florida and back without any problems and were quite comfortable.  We have not had a problem with it which required servicing.  Love all the goodies we got on it including air, cruise, power windows, and sunroof.<br><br>
