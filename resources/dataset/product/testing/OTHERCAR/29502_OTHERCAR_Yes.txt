            When I decided to buy a digital camera, I scoured Epinions.com for opinions on one that was user-friendly and cost efficient, yet would give me lots of options.  I wasn't looking for something exorbitant, since I'm not ready to give up my regular camera just yet:  I needed a digital specifically for auction pictures.  The Kodak DC240 Digital Camera DEFINITELY fits the bill.  I just bought this camera 2 days ago, and I've already successfully gotten more than 20 pictures on the Web for my eBay auctions.  Actually, within 2 hours, I had the basic features of the camera figured out and my pictures were glaring back at me from the computer screen! :)

The biggest draw for the Kodak DC240 is that EVERYTHING you need to get your pictures on the computer is included in the box.  There are optional accessories available, of course, but all the basics are included:  2 sets of batteries (1 rechargeable), the USP adapter, software, and a bunch of cords that I don't quite know the function of yet, but obviously did not need to get my pictures on the computer.  The manual is VERY easy to understand:  you don't need a degree in brain science to figure out the basic functions of the camera.  Best of all, you don't need to take your pictures at the highest resolution to have them come out beautifully onscreen:  low works just fine and gives you quality pics.  

I will echo the sentiments of other Epinions users and say you'd be wise to buy another set of rechargeable batteries for this camera:  it certainly does suck the life out of them fast, even though loading the pictures is fairly fast using the USB connection.  I'd also recommend buying an adapter so you can work on electrical power instead of battery power while uploading:  it's an expense that will save you the frustration of low batteries, and will pay for itself eventually.

I fully expected to buy this camera and stare at it dumbly for days, weeks, maybe even months before figuring out how to get my auction pictures up and running:  I am pleasantly surprised at this camera's ease of use, and I am very, very satisfied with the DC240.
