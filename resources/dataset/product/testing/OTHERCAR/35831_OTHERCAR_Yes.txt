            This vehicle is great.  It has a sleak look, manuevers well, and gets good gas mileage.  The car is not too fancy and is very sporty.  It has the right luxuries that I enjoy for a non-luxury car: remote keychain lock control, leather, CD player, great anti-skid system, moon-roof.  The only disadvantages are that I can now hear the engine rumble a litle when it idles.  I don't know if this is a normal problem or if it is fixable (I'm not a mechanic), but its not a huge problem.  Although I'm writing many lines on it to make this 100 words :-).  Anyway, the car is nice, is comfortable, and is good for longer trips.  I most like the pickup and it has a great 'performance' or sport mode.  Overall, the car has never needed any real repair and it has been most useful in my life of commuting to school and visiting friends.  I recommend that you buy this car, I looked at recent Saturns, and the 1996 ones seem to be the best year and the best looking.<br><br>
