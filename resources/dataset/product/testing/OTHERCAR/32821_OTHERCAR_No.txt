            While my Cavalier was relatively cheap and gets great gas mileage, it has had many problems.  Since I first received it, it has had an oil consumption problem. Every other month between oil changes, the &quot;check oil&quot; light seems to go on. My oil is low, and I need to top it off--not good.  Worse yet, dealers say it is within GM's guidelines and you should be checking your oil every time you get gas anyway. Many Cavalier owners put a lot of miles on their cars. I fill up on gas at least once a week and am not interested in checking my oil weekly, not does this seem to be required on most cars. So, the oil consumption problem lingers on even today...

Other problems: The ignition stopped working on a cold day in Indianapolis requiring a tow and a couple hundred dollar fix. This past summer, I could hear some rattling when I started the engine. The engine had to be re-built! Good thing I had bought the extended warranty.

Other things about the car:  It is sporty in appearance, it is easy to drive, it fits in compact parking spaces, and as I said before the gas mileage is great. I would only buy it again if it was the only car I could afford.  I'd definitely be interested in something more mechanically sound like a Honda Civic in the future. <br><br>
