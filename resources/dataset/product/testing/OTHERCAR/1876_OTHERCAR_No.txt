            As a junior in high school ('95) I decided I needed to buy my own car because I was tired of driving mom and dads OLD, &quot;not cool&quot; car.  I was so excited to bring home this, what I thought then was the greatest thing ever, '92 Grand Am!  It was not brand new, but new to me.  After about a year of having this wonderful, nice looking, up to date, car, the problems began.  

First one thing and then another.  Still making payments and trying to juggle a repair bill was not the easiest thing to do at that age.  The next year I went off to college with my dad believing that I had a set of wheels that he trusted to get me anywhere.  Okay he meant home and back, but you know how that goes! ha ha  

Anyway, I found myself with a new best friend at the repair shop I started visiting about once every couple of weeks.  He would just laugh every time I would bring my junk of junk in with something else wrong!  I didn't exactly find it funny when I received the bills. 

Needless to say I am still driving the same ol' hunk of junk because my father believes we have fixed almost every part on the car so it should be as good as new.  Plus the day I bought it he told me I would not be getting a new car until the wheels on this one fall off.  He wasn't kidding and let me just say that is about the only thing that hasn't happened to that darn car!  Isn't he just so funny???? <br><br>
