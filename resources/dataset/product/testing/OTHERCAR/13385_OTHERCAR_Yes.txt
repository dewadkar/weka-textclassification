              One of my favorite cars that I have ever owned was my 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier.  The car was purchased for me by my parents and it was my second vehicle, ever.  It was a new/used car, used as a demonstrator model and we got quite a deal on it.  I loved that car!
  
  This particular Cavalier was a 4 door model.  It was loaded with a ton of options including AM/FM cassette, cruise control, tilt wheel, air conditioning, reclining seats, and more.  It was a very nice car for a great price.  We were very happy to get such a steal! 

  The car was white with red striping/trim on it.  As I said, it was a four door model, which made it more roomy and was easier to get in and out of.  I was in school at the time of my owning it, so it was convienient for me to get my books and materials in and out of the car.  I was also a volunteer firefighter and the spacious trunk made it wonderful to haul my gear around and gain access to easily.  

  This car was purchased for $9,500.  We received the same warranty that would come with a brand new vehicle, 3 years or 30,000 miles.  The sales people were wonderful about making sure that we had everything that we needed, including bonus bucks offered by GM as an incentive for purchasing this demonstrator vehicle.

  The car had plenty of power, especially on take off.  Some cars are better on the long run with acceleration, but as soon as I punched the gas pedal, the power was instant.  I loved that feature.  The car was also excellent on gas.  I would get about 28-30 miles per gallon on highways and about 22-25 miles per gallon on city roads.

  The only problem that I ever had with this car began after an accident.  I was rear ended at a stop light and had horrible problems after that.  First, let me tell you that the bumpers on this vehicle are bumper covers and they are expensive to replace! Thank goodness the guy at fault had to pay for them!  They scuff really easily!  The tail light lenses are also expensive to replace!  The accident caused damage to the frame of this car.  Mind you, I was sitting still and the truck behind me was slowing, and didn't hit me with that much speed, but the car was junked!  It drove down the road SIDEWAYS!  You could watch the front and rear of my car at the same time if you were following it!  It was horrible.  Controlling the car was impossible, so at that point, we opted to get rid of it and get something else, as there wasn't enough "damage" to total the car.

  Overall, unless involved in an accident, I highly recommend this vehicle.  Even in a used state (it had 20,000 miles on it when we purchased it) it is dependable, reliable, comfortable, and powerful.  It makes a great family car, or a car for someone who needs the room.  I'd check it out!
