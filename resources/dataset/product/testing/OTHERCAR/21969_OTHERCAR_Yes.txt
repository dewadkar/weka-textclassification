            Well in the market for a sports car and not a lot of initial money, I looked into early 90's RX7's. I loved the look of them and after driving it I was in love. The one I purchased was a 90' GTU. I looked at the turbo's, but didn't want to spend the extra money on insurance. This was a black 5 speed and ran like a dream. I probably didn't drive the car with the best of care. This was my first car that really had some power. After purchasing it and realizing how fast it was, I grew the need for more speed. I started first by getting a K&amp;N filter and then I put on a cat back Dynomax exhaust. What a great combo for performance and sound. The sound it produced was like no other and was not too loud to be annoying. About 5 months after getting the car the transmission went south and ended up have to replace the clutch with it. Little did I know that was going to be a routine thing. I went through 5 clutches in this car in a little over two years. I know what you're thinking, stop beating the car, but that was not the complete issue. After the second replacement I was easier on it than before and the same result. Each clutch I only ended up having to pay labor on, but that was still no fun. I highly suggest if you ever have a clutch go to replace it with a performance clutch no matter how you drive it. On my way to get my 4th clutch put in, because of slippage, I was clipped in the back end by an old Chevy truck. My wing was broke off, tail lights smashed, bumper creamed, and the passenger back panel in pretty bad shape. Initially I was thinking around a grand or two of damage. Little did I know the estimates were around $5,000. Oh well I didn't pay for it! I got the whole car re-painted and all the other things replaced too. I ended up getting an after market wing, because it would have been the same price as the factory one. When I got it back it looked great, and with the new clutch once again it ran like a dream. Then the next problem started, which was a brake issue. For some reason my back brakes would start locking up when it was hot out. After having this looked at I was told it was my caliber's, so I had them replaced.(not cheap) The car then started to run good again for about a month. Then same problem again. I had it looked at again and had to replace the master cylinder. This fixed the problem, but still cost quite a bit more money. About this time I was thinking where can I get a for sale sign. Which I did and ran a couple ads and some lucky guy obtained my lovable car when it wants to be. I heard from the guy a couple of times about the clutch and then the engine. I am not in contact with him now, but I think the engine blew on him. I had seen him around town a couple of times hot roding and I knew that it wouldn't be long. 
I don't know how I can say this, but I loved that car. When it ran right it was like no other. The handling was superb and the performance was super. If I had a lot of money to waste on a car, I would not doubt go get another one. So if you fit that category then go out and enjoy yourself, if not don't even think about it!
Oh and by the way I ran a 97' 5.0 mustang at the track and beat him by a car length.<br><br>
