            When I began to consider buying an SUV, the Toyota 4Runner immediately became one of my top choices when I saw one on the road. Other SUV's under consideration were the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder and the 2000 Ford Explorer. There's no doubt that the 4Runner looks really great. But I had to ask myself whether that's all it was; style but no substance. I was pleasantly surprised. 

EXTERIOR: 9
As I said before, the 4Runner looks great. I got the Sport Package, which includes, a hood scoop, color-keyed fender flares and grill, and the 16&quot; 5-spoke alloy wheels. Having no chrome on the thing really makes it look sharp. It basically looks like a Limited model from the outside, but without the body side molding. When people saw my new car, I just heard, &quot;Wow...&quot; and &quot;I didn't know it looked that good.&quot; The hood scoop is a nice touch, but all it really does is allow cool air to come into the engine compartment. It is not an air intake. But that's fine with me. 

INTERIOR: 7
I'd have to say that Toyota could make some improvements here. For one thing, there are too many options. It gets pretty crazy trying to remember what you wanted and why. I did get a walnut wood dash, which added some elegance. The wood had a nice looking grain/pattern to it, and didn't look cheap. The seats are pretty comfortable, but it does not compare to seats that are in minivans (Nissan Quest for example), or even in the Explorer. Those things are like couches! Nevertheless, they are still fine. There was ample leg room and head room, but it could use some more, especially down below. My brother commented that it seems like there should be more room from what you see on the outside, and that it's sort of deceiving. Nevertheless, it will seat 4 very comfortably, and 5 if that 5th person is on the thin side. I wish that the center storage console was bigger, so I could place my CD-changer in there! I didn't want to spend around $500 for the factory trunk-mounted or in-dash changer. The CD/Tape/FM/AM stereo deck itself is OK, but it would be nice with an 8-speaker system, rather than just 6. How about some more juice? I decided to put my aftermarket CD-changer under the seat. The cargo area is very spacious. I can fit tons of stuff back there! I can't wait to pack all my snowboarding gear back there this winter when I go to Lake Tahoe. I love the power rear window! You can even open it from your keyless entry remote! Cool! All in all, a pretty good interior, but I've seen better, like in the Pathfinder.

ENGINE: 7
V6 with 183 horses is good, but it needs more. This thing is heavy, and the Pathfinder has 240+ horses! It would be nice if Toyota put in some more sophisticated engine technology into this vehicle, as Nissan did with the 2001 Pathfinder. What is up with the small fuel tank? With the gas mileage of SUV's, this is something that can definitely be improved here. I just don't want to be at the pump that often, and 18.5 gallons is not that big at all. That all said, the 4Runner feels great, and the power is sufficient. Don't get the 4 cylinder. I think the V6 is a must here. Also, driving the automatic transmission, I found that you can shift from 2WD to 4WD while moving and vice-versa. But to use the low 4WD (when you go off-roading and you want to prevent excessive spin and get better traction by keeping the gear selection low -- more torque), you will have to stop, put it in Neutral, select L4WD, then put it in Drive. No big deal, just thought I'd mention that for you serious off-roaders. The Limited has multi-mode 4WD, which basically means that it will kick in on-demand, but it uses more fuel to do this.

RIDE: 8
The ride is quiet enough and smooth enough, after all this is an SUV. I didn't expect any better unless I was in a Lexus. Hitting some bumps does cause the vehicle to feel like it's bouncing though. I think it could be quieter. I judge by how much I have to turn up my stereo when I'm moving. It's not as noisy as my Honda Civic, but that is another review. Ground clearance is the largest in its class, but not with the running boards. It brings it back to par. But it sits very high, and it feels great to be able to see everything so well when you drive. I feel like I'm king of the road. 

HANDLING: 8
Well, this IS an SUV. That taken into account, I'd say the 4Runner is very nimble. Turning radius is pretty large, but then again, I used to drive a Honda Civic. It didn't feel like I was driving a boat, however, which is good. It definitely felt less overwhelming (size-wise) than the Ford Explorer. It doesn't seem to sway even when I switch lanes very quickly. 

RELIABILITY: 10
I just bought this car, so I can't say, but having driven a Toyota pick-up for years, I can say these things run and run and run. Not to mention the tons of testimonials from countless others. I'll go by reputation. 

VALUE: 8
I think that if you want the most car for your buck, the 4Runner may not be for you, depending on what packages you get. You can get the same features for less in other comparable SUV's. But Toyota is tops in reliability and this SUV is pretty mature. It is not as new as, say, a Mitsubishi Montero Sport. Toyota definitely has experience in this area. I think that I got a good deal for my SR5, considering that I got almost everything that a Limited Edition has, except leather seats, and multi-mode 4WD, all for about $4000 less than I would have paid had I gotten the Limited. Wow, the Limited is expensive... $35K+! I'd have to say that if you get an SR5 4WD with the Discount Convenience Package, the Sport Package w/Differential Lock, and the Upgrade Package #2, you will get the best value. It looks just like the Limited (again without multi-mode 4WD, no body side molding, SR5 has color-keyed trim instead of chrome or grey, and no leather seats or wood dash). On my SR5, I only got the wood dash (on top of the packages that I mentioned).


FINAL ANSWER?:
I got my SR5 for probably about the same price for a fully equipped Pathfinder. The 4Runner is a fine vehicle, and is definitely one of the best in its class. But to be brutally honest, what put it over the top was it's styling. It looks great! Even though it may not be the BEST value, I'm still very happy with it. Everything is great, and it's so fun to drive!<br><br>
