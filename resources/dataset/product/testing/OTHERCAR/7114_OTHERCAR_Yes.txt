            This is absolutely the benchmark roadster. Many magazines have reviewed it and agreed. 
It is CAR (A British Magazine) magazine's top roadster this year, that was the Mk3, but besides a few minor changes it is the same car.
The 1999 Mazda Miata has a duel cam 4 valves per cylinder 1.8 liter 4 cylinder engine and has around 140 horsepower, and goes from 0-60mph in 8.0 seconds. Throughout my ownership of this car I have attained a Gas mileage of around 25mpg in mainly city drama; a respectable figure. I would only recommend the manual gearbox as when you are buying as raw a car as this, why would you cheapen it with an automatic transmission?

I bought it as my first car and it is a dream to drive. It has been reliable to me except for one problem with the driveshaft sensor which had to be fixed. It's gear shift is wonderful and short- better even than a 911's. It handles wonderfully, and though is not blindingly fast; it makes up for it in quick acceleration and the ability to corner quickly. It's engine note is tuneful, yet not overpowering
The interior is pleasant though basic. The basic stereo is of a high quality and the optional Bose system is excellent. It is cleaner and tidier than a MR-2's and more coherent than a Z3's(not to mention the exterior is much more attractive.) It is cramped at time, though I (6'2'') have no problem commuting every day in it. The boot could be bigger but this really is only a minor inconvenience as more space is rarely needed, especially as many will buy this as a second car)

In conclusion, this is a wonderful 1st or 2nd (or 3rd) car. I would recommend everyone to buy or at least test drive one as I feel that it is the benchmark roadster and may well change you conceptions of driving a car this small.
It may not be fast enough or aggressive enough for some; but it is a pure roadster, and if you still crave extra speed or looks, there is a large amount of easy modifications which can be done to the Miata: new intake, supercharger, new exhaust, all which will make it fast and still keep it cheap.

For more information I recommend that you visit www.miata.net or www.miataforum.com ; two excellent resources in learning about the past and future of this wonderful car!
