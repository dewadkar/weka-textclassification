            If you've seen my two angry postings about how unhappy I was with my 1998 GMC Sonoma, well, that truck finally died at only 55,000 miles from transmission failure.... so I considered a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, VW Passat, and VW Jetta TDI diesel.   To cut to the chase, the camry is too expensive and ugly, the accord too boring, expensive, and uncomfortable, and I couldn't find a VW I liked or could afford.  So on the advice of family and friends I went to Saturn to try the L series.
It was purchased from Saturn of Louisville (Kentucky).  I was very impressed by the dealer's no-haggle price and very low-pressure sales process.  I was there 5 hours and looked at 7 individual cars, and they didn't complain or try to get rid of me.  Finally, I decided on a 2002 L-200 "factory executive car" with 10,000 miles on it.   It had the upgraded Audio Package I, power seats, Sport Package (Fog lights, sunroof, polished alloy wheels).  Original sticker was $21,010.   As it was a "used" car, they discounted it to $18,495.   The bottom line price with tax, license, fees, etc. was $18,940.   I got 3.9% financing for 60 months, which worked out to $348/month.   They were very upfront about the cost of the car, the tax/license/registration/notary fees plus a $289.50 "dealer documentation and preparation fee" built-in to the deal (you cannot get out of paying it I found out).   They consulted 6 different banks, and the GMAC/Chase Manhattan 3.9% was the best deal of them all.  NOTE:  The L-200 series qualifies for this rate, the entry-level L-100 cars do NOT !!    It was a better deal to buy the L-200 with a bunch of options at 3.9% than to buy the L-100 with fewer options at 8.25% for the same monthly payment !!    The saleslady was very, very helpful to me and took a lot of time to explain all the features of the car, where they were, how they worked, etc.   They also introduced me to the finance manager, sales manager, general manager, the parts manager, service manager, and all 4 on-duty mechanics plus the other 2 salesmen present.   Very interesting...I got "The Saturn Send-Off" and I was on my way.  :)      Now for comment on the car itself:    It looks very sinister, positively evil since it is black with a black interior and shiny polished wheels.  ( Dr. Evil would ask, "Is it an Evil Saturn?")   Friends, family, and co-workers have all commented on the richness of the paint job...it is absolutely top quality.  I used to work in a body shop, I couldn't spray it on any better myself!!    It is mirror-finish black.    It came with a couple of minor scratches, but with 10k on the odometer, I'll overlook that.  No big deal to me.   The interior was shampooed and detailed for me while I waited at no charge, and it looked great.   I like the seats...I agree with Mr. Gourmet's review on this one...I am over 300 pounds too and the seats are very, very comfortable for me.   Even with the sunroof there is plenty of headroom.  The dashboard has very large, clear gauges.   Window controls are on the console (GM bought out Saab...you can tell their influence here), which will take getting used to.  I kind of like it...but the shifter blocks the front passenger side window button if you're sitting in the driver's seat.  The rear windows and door locks both can be shut off so the kids don't escape ;)  but if you get locked in the trunk, it has an inside release so you can escape. :)     I like the feel of the interior fabrics...not the coarse tweedy material the Japanese use and not the sticky lint-magnet velour the Germans and Ford use.   The fake wood trim looks really good....best fake wood I've ever seen (a couple of people have thought it is real).   The stereo system ROCKS !!!   I've played everything in it from Mozart and Wagner to Metallica and the Who (you should hear the bass on "My Generation"....wow...).
Very "tight" bass response and clear midrange/treble too from the 8 speakers (with subwoofer).    I've never had a sunroof before, but it is a nice touch I think.    So, how's it drive?   Accelerates very strongly for a 4-cylinder, probably stronger than my old Taurus V6 and definitely better than the puny GMC Sonoma.   The automatic transmission is amazingly smooth and the drivetrain is quiet.   I do like the "RRRwwwwaaaauuuuggghh!!!!" sound it makes when you punch it hard...some might not but it sounds vicious under that hood.  :)     Brakes are very good, no fade noticed and the 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with traction control works well in the rain.    Handling is crisp and responsive...better than the Accord but not quite up to VW standards, firm but not harsh ride.   Others tell me the L series is a good highway car with good mileage...I'm still on my first tankful, but it's gone about 150 miles on a quarter-tank so far.   Visibility is good, but the D-pillar (rearmost pillar) is a bit large.  For shorter drivers the high trunk and spoiler might block vision....I find it acceptable though.    Like I said earlier, I am a big guy and I have no trouble getting in or out of the seats...doors open wide...much better than the smaller S-series!!!   The car sits a bit low but not too bad (it is easier to get in/out of than the GMC Sonoma).   The other thing that I like are the big clear markings on all of the controls.  The placement of the radio buttons is absolutely horrible but once figured out, I'll live with it.  Still better than some of the imports that have 500 tiny buttons on their radios.    Oh, it has a cassette too but I haven't tried it yet!!    That's about it for my initial report on the Saturn L-200.  I'll post a follow-up on down the road but after my first week of ownership, I give it a big thumbs-up.
