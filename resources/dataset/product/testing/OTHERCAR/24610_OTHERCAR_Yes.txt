            I decided to buy an Olds Cutlass Ciera due to how much I enjoyed driving them when working in rentals & leasing several years ago.  I also found these cars to be an average of $5,000 less and in better condition than used Toyota Camrys of the same model year, which had been my initial choice of used car before affordability became the primary issue.

I bought a 1993 SL model in April 2003.  What I love most about this car is the power, roominess, and features you get for such a great price!  I've heard warnings to avoid the 4-cylinder models.  I agree -- the 3.3L V6 is very responsive and powerful in this car; I have no troubles passing or climbing steep hills on the highway.  The engine is super smooth, and the transmission likewise.  The interior is quite roomy and the trunk is cavernous for this mid-sized sedan!  I also like the remote door and trunk release and most of the other options that come with this car, like those powerful GM stereos, AC, and power locks and windows.  I also like the build integrity; I can't detect a single squeak, rattle, or any unusual wind noise.  Fuel economy is great, but adding platinum-tipped spark plugs has boosted that by at least 15% on my car.

My only concerns involve potential electrical problems down the road (none yet, though).  Although this is an issue with any car, the SL model almost comes with too many power options, sometimes redundant ones.  For example, I could do without the power antenna and power seats; I would trade these for remote mirrors any day.  I also wish I could have manual control over the intensity of my headlight beams (in Canada, daytime running lights are mandatory).  In my car, a light sensor determines this.  I also don't like how, as I turn the key to start the car, the headlights come on even before I start the engine.  I consider this a waste of battery power, and what if I needed the extra cold-cranking amps (did I mention that I live in Canada)?

These minor cons aside, I absolutely LOVE this car!!  When I look at certain small and large-sized SUV's for several times the price that have less passenger room, cargo space, and/or power than this car, I both laugh AND count my blessings!

In terms of repairs/maintenance, I had to replace the power steering pump, water pump, intake manifold gasket, and muffler in the first year of ownership.  I was NOT impressed by this start (I'm also a Toyota owner who hasn't had to do this much over a several year period!).  However, the past 6 months have been totally trouble-free, which means I hope the bugs from the mysterious previous owner have been worked out.  I bought it at 129,000 km (80,000 miles) and have since added 25,000 km (16,000 miles) to this.  Keep in mind that I got this car in outstanding interior and exterior condition.  This may be why I've had such a great car to date despite the first year bugs.

So would this thirty-something family man/jock recommend this car!  ABSOLUTELY!!!  But IF you can get a used one in good condition; to this end, have an independent mechanical inspection (not by someone recommended by the person selling you the car).  And also IF you don't care about image.  Sure, some people call this a "granny car", but to me it's one of the best bangs for your buck.  This car kicks most others in terms of power and acceleration (again, I refer to the V6 models).  You get so much for far less than other vehicles.  Let other people spend the big dough for image, less room and/or power, and greater long-term depreciation.  Buy this car instead and laugh your way to the bank!
