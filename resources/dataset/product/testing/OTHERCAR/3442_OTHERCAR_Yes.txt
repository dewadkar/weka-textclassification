            My father always drove big, comfortable, luxury cars, so I am spoiled when it comes to riding around. The 2001 Acura 3.2CL is as comfortable as any car I have ridden it, and when my father allowed me the opportunity to drive his while I was there on vacation I was even more impressed. The car has an excellent design. It is elegant and sophisticated. Its drive is incredibly smooth. Because it is so smooth, you need to keep a special eye on the spedometer. You will think you're going slower than you are, but it's likely that a cop won't. The car feels like a much larger car, but maneuvers like a much smaller one. 

The 2001 3.2CL's impressive performance exceeds anything else I've encountered in its price range and class. Even on the up and down inclines of San Diego (some hills up to 23% grade), the engine never struggled in the least.  

It is very relaxing to ride in this car. The leather seating is cushy. It feels luxurious, even a bit decadent. The controls and instruments are well placed, though frankly, the buttons are a bit small. They are all conveniently located and the dashboard is easy to read. I like the remote keyless entry when I'm carrying things out to the car. Anything that allows me to keep another hand free is good. The leg room in the car is impressive. I'm only 5'4&quot;, but my boyfriend is 6'3&quot; and he loved this car. 

The sound system in the car is another great luxury. It has a 6-disc CD player/cassette player and radio. The sound that eminates from the system is terrific. It has Bose speakers. We listened to jazz, classical and rock with the surround-sound system, and decided that the system in the car sounded better than the one we had at home.

The CL is covered by 4-year/50,000 mile limited warranty, a 5-year/unlimited-mileage outer body rust-through warranty and a 4-year/50,000 Acura Total Luxury Car package with roadside assistance. Most of my friends who have had Acura's tell me that they rarely have to do anything with their warranties. The cars are incredibly well built and reliable. My father has not had any problems with any Acura's in the past, and he anticipates the same quality from this machine.

The CLï¿½s mileage is pretty decent, though not great. It gets about 18 to 20  miles per gallon in the city and 26-30 miles per gallon on the highway.
