                 In July 2000 I decided I was ready for a new car.  I had about $20K to spend and began searching.  I knew I wanted a compact car and looked at Mitsubishis, Mazdas, Nissans, and even an Acura.  I finally came down to the two door Honda Civic or a four door Nissan Sentra or Altima.  The Civic had surprisingly more room in the back then the Sentra and I didn't really want a four door car.  I also knew that Hondas last forever and decided to go with the Civic.
     I finally got my silver Civic near the end of August.  I bought it fully loaded for about $17K.  This included moonroof, spoiler, pin striping, and other good stuff like that.  
     Now, almost two and a half months later I must say I made a great decision.  I probably fill up the tank less than once every week and a half and I have had no problems.  This is a great car.  You will think so too.<br><br>
