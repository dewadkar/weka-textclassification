            i bought my 98 neon R/T in spring '98, after waiting for it's arrival that winter.  with the 150 horsepower 5 speed, it was as fast as you could get for a car in it's price range, and have four doors on it to boot.  the handling is crisp...the tuned suspension gives for a flat turn everytime, even at high speeds, though i wish the car was lower to the ground (tho that can be fixed of course w/ new springs).

the ride is very firm, so if you want a couch while you're driving, this is not the car for you.  the R/T's special seats give more support than regular neons, which helps alot during corners.  this car gets attention everytime i drive it, with it's silver stripes down the center, which came with the car, and unique R/T wheels.  the steering is quicker than other neons as well, along with the acceleration improved by a different transmission ratio.  if you're looking for something that's alot cheaper than the 99 honda civic SI, which has about the same speed, this is the perfect car, and it will be much cheaper on insurance, due to its low resale value.  this is also a great car for someone who wants to stand out, and not be another fast honda, or boring american car.

i've had a few problems with my neon, however, i still love it, and plan on owning it until it no longer drives.  i've had the headgasket replaced, as well as a major trunk leak.  but the week's hassle for those would not deter me from buying it again.  every time i drive it i'm happy with it, and it's the first car i loved to drive...for 15k new, and acceleration times up there with cars double the price.  this is the way the neon should have always been, and if you can find one of them, since they are so rare, you'll love the drive the first time and thereafter.<br><br>
