            It is a little bit of both, a new designed in 1997 Subaru Forester is just what I wanted out of a car.  A 2.3 L Forester is a strong running sport utility vehicle.  It is tall and roomy and gives plenty of cargo space for anything you want to fit, from groceries to furniture.  The 2001 Model runs around $20,000 which I think is a little too much for a small SUV.  I wish it had no options at all, I like cars with no power equipment, no power brakes, no power steering.  They run cheaper too.  Unfortunately Subaru does not offer this.  If they only tried to sell a base model for around $15K, it would be one of the best-selling cars.  There is just too many competetive automobiles in the price range of $20,000 and no offense but some, like Volvo S40 beat the Forester in safety and power.  Power is something that Forester doesn't have a lot of, with its four cylinder engine it does pull five adults on the mountain slopes with great handling of an AWD in snow, but performance is limited for this Subaru.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reliable, fun to drive, small SUV with great visibility and suspension.  Oh, and one last thing, the back seat is not very comfy!<br><br>
