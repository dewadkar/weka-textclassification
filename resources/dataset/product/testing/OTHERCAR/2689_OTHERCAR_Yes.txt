              After years of driving large Lincoln Town Cars and Mark IVs and Mark Vs, I figured it was time to look at a Sport Utility Vehicle. I had considered a Lincoln Navigator (1998) - but these are simply STILL too pricey (approx $33-$34,000 in the Northeast). I then considered the Mountaineer. My local Lincoln-Mercury dealer had a fine selection of these (I ended up opting for the &quot;Monterey&quot;special edition...mine is Light Spruce Green Metallic over Prairie Tan metallic with the Prairie Tan leather-trimmed sport bucket seats). Although the price of my &quot;new&quot; Mountaineer Monterey listed at just under $36,000 (-$950 no-cost leather credit in this part of the country) It has MANY features of the larger Lincoln Navigator...in a tighter and more maneuverable package. I opted for a 3 year - 36,000 lease (another first for me).  
  The main attraction to me other than the very &quot;trendy&quot; color combination were all the luxury features and upgrades that make stepping into one of these from my previous Lincolns that much easier. The responsive 5.0 liter V8 with electronic automatic overdrive at 3.73 limited slip axle - combined with the standard All-Wheel Drive assures a level of confidence...both on dry and wet or snow covered roadways. 
  Plus the Mountaineer actually rides a bit better than the comparable Ford Explorer. The Mercury &quot;feels&quot; tighter and more solid...and I feel, a slightly smoother ride than the Ford's. Plus all the features in the &quot;Luxury Group&quot; and &quot;Convenience Group&quot; seem to make the Mercury a better value dollar for dollar. Plus the leasing incentive and promotion that are occurring in the Philadelphia sales district sweetened the deal all the more. (1.75% lease rate/waiving security deposit/free Mountain bike)
  The six-way powered sport bucket seats make you feel &quot;regal&quot; and you can end up sitting higher in the seat and have a commanding view around you (a'la Navigator/Expedition) The AM-FM cassette/single CD stereo is choice...as is the optional Mach Audio System with 6-disc CD changer in the console. The available side air bags built into the front seat side bolsters instill yet another measure of safety...let alone a reduction in the insurance rate. The available Power Glass Moonroof is WONDERFUL. Almost makes me forget about my Town Cars...Almost. The integral &quot;Homelink&quot; garage door opener with &quot;TravelNote&quot; recorder is an excellent feature...perfect to record directions to a new destination...or to simply &quot;pick up a quart of milk on the way home&quot;
  Several features I wish the SUV would have available are: Memory driver's seat, heated seats, heated and/or signal outside mirrors and something very small, but VERY important - an underhood light. <br><br>
