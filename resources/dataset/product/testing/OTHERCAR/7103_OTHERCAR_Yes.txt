            If you're a true car enthusiast, you should go out to your nearest Mazda dealer and take this baby for a test drive. Why? Well for one thing, the Miata is one of the few affordable roadsters available today. You can get one for around 20 grand. But what truly makes this car great is how it makes driving fun. Any Miata owner will tell you that they love driving their car. What makes this car different from say a Prelude? There's nothing quite like driving a convertible. When your behind the wheel of a Miata, with the top down cruising along, a sense of freedom overcomes you. With the marvelous handling of the Miata, you'll feel like you were controlling a F1 race car. The handling feels that good. There are very few flaws in this car. For one, I wished the trunk was a bit bigger. I would have also liked it if Mazda gave the Miata a slightly stronger engine. The current engine is nice, but more power would be welcomed. But these are very minor things. So, is the Miata for you? Well, if you like the wind in your hair and the feeling of total control and freedom, you owe it to yourself to atleast test drive the Miata. If you're looking for a car to go to work in, you might as well do it in style right? The Miata is perfectly suited for many people. The Miata is no family car, nor is it a vehicle for the faint of heart. This car is for the people who enjoy driving just for the thrill of driving. <br><br>
