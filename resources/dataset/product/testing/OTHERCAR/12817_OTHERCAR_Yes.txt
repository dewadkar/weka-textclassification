            (Note:  This is a previous review that I edited, and placed in the CORRECT category..Thanks.  I have deleted the other one.)

We have always owned Nissan cars, and we always will buy Nissan.  We have had only good experiences with the dealerships, sales people and the cars!  

We previously had a 95 Sentra GXE, but now we have a 97 Altima GXE.  We have never had any trouble with either car.  As a matter of fact, the only time they have ever even been to a shop was for a scheduled tune-up or scheduled maintenance!  

We bought the Altima when our first baby was born because we needed a bigger, family size car.  But it's not TOO big.  I am a small, short person, so I have trouble driving large vehicles, but the Altima is perfect for me. It handles great, and it is comfortable for me to drive.

The first time my husband and I test drove it, we were in love!  It is easy to handle and rides smoothly!  And boy does it have pickup!  I wasn't used to that at first, but now I love it!  And it's great on gas mileage!  It gets about 30 miles per gallon on average, but more than that on longer, uninterrupted interstate trips.

The 1997 Nissan Altima has great features:

- Four door model
- Upholstered seats
- Power locks (with child safety feature on rear doors)
- Power windows (with safety lock on all passenger windows)
- Cassette player
- Stereo with 12 station memory buttons
- A/C and Heat
- Rear Defroster
- <b>HUGE</b> Trunk Space
- Power adjusting mirrors
- Preventative Features (alarm sounds when you leave lights on; doors will not lock if you have left your keys in the ignition)
- 4 Cylinder Engine

Our Altima is an automatic transmission, and it has on overdrive that can be turned on and off with the push of a button.  Turning the overdrive off helps with climbing hills and quick acceleration, but we rarely use it because it will use more gasoline.  

I recommend this car to anyone that needs an affordable family car solution.  We have had no problems with the Altima.  We got a really great deal on this one!  And I absolutely love driving it!!!!  <br><br>
