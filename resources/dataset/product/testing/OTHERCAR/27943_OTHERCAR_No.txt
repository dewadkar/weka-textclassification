            Bought car because it is nimble and quick -- great handling. But then so are a lot of other cars. Interior is HORROR - polyester fabric started to pill within 6 weeks. Took Bernardsville dealership 4 months to order replacement --  but received sports seats. Then another 4 months to receive only half the seat covers -- which are pilling badly. And now 4 months later, they say they are waiting...Actually now, they don't even return phone calls. Aka dealer, they can only order exact replacement part -- i.e. more pilling fabric, even though it is clearly not in stock and not scheduled for production because it failed so poorly. This is our 6th Audi. Apparently Audi sales so robust, they can't get parts and can't keep track. Audi America now 1+ year later says they want factory rep to look at car...again?? Bernardsville tried to explain that this pilling is &quot;natural&quot; -- this after waiting 6 weeks for appointment.Don't waste time standing in line to get natural pilling synthetic fabric seats. 
Audi still can't get those cup holders right -- first ones were so shallow cups fell over and spilled everywhere. Replacement sits in well behind the old cups, behind brake and under center console. You need to be a contortionist to reach there.
But like I said, otherwise a good driving car. If you never need anything beyond routine service, no problem.
