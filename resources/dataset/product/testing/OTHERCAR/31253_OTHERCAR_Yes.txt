            I purchased a metallic- blue Pontiac Grand Am SE 4- door sedan with 89,000 miles. Here is more information about this great car:



Exterior: The exterior is racy and curvy. The front has wrap-a-round headlamps a split- nosed honey combed black grill. The tail end has large tail lamps and a rounded off trunklid. There is a useful and bright center- high mounted stoplamp as well. The SE sedan looks better than the SE coupe because the SE coupe just doesnt fill the long chassis well enough- making the car look stretched. My Grand Am came with the metallic blue paint that turned heads when just washed, but it needs to be polished often to retain its gloss. There are chrome strips running from the front to the back of the car that are well placed. There are ribbed side body moldings that look good too. The car has a low- to- the ground look. Overall look is pleasing and ages well. Everytime i see it in the morning it makes me love it more.

Interior: My Grand Am came with a charcoal gray cloth interior. The fabric holds well to wear but gets dirty fast because of the color. The dash has a modern- simplistic look that emanates throughout the cabin. A simple shifter is in the middle console, along with a storage bin. I liked the multi- function turn signal/headlamps switch, it was easier to use than a knob dial. The plastic materials are hard but dont look cheap. The HVAC knobs are soft to the touch and the AC blows icy cold air on hot days but robs the Quad 4 of some power. The dash glows a soothing red at night and the driver has easy access and reach to the radio and HVAC controls. The door locks lock by themselves when you shift from park to a drive gear and unlock when you turn the car off. Interior lighting is good too. When you pull the key from the slot the inside lights come on, and when you start the car the inside lights fade like a theater, instead of just shutting off. Driver ride height is terrible, you feel like you're sitting on the ground. The steering wheel is nice too. There is a drivers airbag and but no passenger airbag.

Driving impressions: The Quad-4 engine rated at 150 hp and 195 pounds feet of torque is really challenged when it launches off from a stand still or under heavy loads or carrying 5 adult Samoans (my family). The engine has really good mid- to high range respondsiveness and torque, passing power is good. The Quad- 4 is loud and overall unrefined. Gas mileage is quite good. Braking is so-so. The Grand Ams handling is what i like. You can drive this car at 100 MPH and the car will seem to float on the road. The steering is quick and has good driver feedback from the road making you feel well connected to the car. Cornering in the car leans a bit too much. The ride is good but big potholes and irregularities are felt harshly, speed bumps arent its best friend either. I liked the big loud horn too, it didn't sound like those whimpy Toyota or Honda horns.
