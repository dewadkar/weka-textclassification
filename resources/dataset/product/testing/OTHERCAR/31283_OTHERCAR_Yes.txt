            Want an affordable, low maintenance vehicle that you can count on?  I have one.  I bought it five years ago, used, and it has 135,000 miles on it so far.  I've driven it on trips from one hour to eleven hours, frequently, with no problem (with the exception of a flat tire).  I lived in the Ozarks of Arkansas for a summer, and my car took the curves and mountainous hills very well.  

I'm not selling my car, if that's what you're thinking.  I just wanted to remind anyone who is considering buying a Toyota Tercel that it would be a great choice.  From my experience, I would say that one would get plenty of mileage on the car without seeing costly consequences.  As mine is a standard, I also get a lot of miles per the gallon.  My car is comfy and cute as well, with just enough room for maximum five people.

I originally bought the car just to get me to school (10 minutes away), and back, considering how old it is.  Yet, the more I got acquainted with it, I realized that the car was good enough for travel, and I felt safe using it for such.  I love the way it drives.  I honestly do not hate anything about my car.

Well, as you can see, I love my Toyota; I hope you love yours!

PS.  My car's name is Mikey.  :)<br><br>
