            Last week, I rented a Mountaineer in Seattle, and used it both around town and to drive through the mountains to Eastern Washington. I drove the Stevens pass going over and took I-90 coming back. The upside is that the Mountaineer is relatively comfortable, and the leather interior feels luxurious. Everything inside is nicely finished, and driver friendly. The downside is that, equipped with the V8, the Mountaineer uses lots of gas. We averaged just over 16 miles per gallon driving both directions over the mountains, and much less- about 12 miles per gallon- in the city.

For a vehicle of this size- basically four or perhaps five passengers, that's poor mileage, even in the mountains. The vehicles has a full lift tailgate, but the mechanism was a bit confusing, and we often opened the glass when we wanted to lift the whole tailgate. Once, due to this, we got a dash message &quot;door ajar&quot; which turned out to be the tailgate glass.

The Mountaineer is also somewhat noisy, especially under acceleration. Compared to the Blazer I drive at home, I thought the Mercury was noticebly louder.

In the mountains, the automatic transmission was constantly shifting- searching for the right gear. At the steepest point, I needed to take it out of automatic overdrive, so that it would keep a relatively constant speed. Even with the V8, it needed to downshift a number of times going through the pass.

Overall, the Mountaineer is a comfortable vehicle, but I wouldn't want to use it as a regular commuter car with that kind of mileage. I shudder to think how much gas the larger Expedition and Navigator must drink.

This is a vehicle for someone who wants a luxury SUV at a reasonable price, with low maintenance costs that come from its sharing almost all parts with the Explorer. On the other hand, at the price that the Mountaineer goes for fully optioned ($32-34,000) you are definitely getting into the territory of the Mercedes M-class, which will undoubtedly keep its value better than the Mercury.
