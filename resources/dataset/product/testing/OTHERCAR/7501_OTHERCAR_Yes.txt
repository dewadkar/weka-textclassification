            I'm a tall guy so I need a little extra room in my car.  Furthermore I spend about 2 hours a day on the road.  So I need a car that's comfortable.  My stratus fits the bill.  I've had it for 3 years and have been very pleased.  The cabin is spacious, and nicely designed.  I went with the standard stereo system and it sounds good.  (I'm not into mega-powerful super car stereos)  It's a very comfortable ride.

I chose `96 with 2.2 liter 4 cylinder engine.  It gets good mileage and has acceptable pick up when you need it.  It handles nicely on the freeways and on the surface streets.  

I certainly don't regret purchasing this automobile.  Here are a few additional points, good and bad.

Likes
- There is sooo much room inside (even the trunk :)  
- It is comfortable, roomy and a pleasure to drive  
- No real maintenance problems just the one listed below
- Good gas mileage
- Good handling
- Heat and air are very efficient

Problems... 
- Twice I've had to have work done on the brakes.  The rear brakes after about a year and the front brakes after about 2 years. 
- It is a bit long.  I have to pass by some parking spots in the city because the car's doesn't quite fit.
- 3 recalls in 3 years (2 that didn't apply to all stratus's 1 that didn't apply to my stratus) I don't know if that's a lot
