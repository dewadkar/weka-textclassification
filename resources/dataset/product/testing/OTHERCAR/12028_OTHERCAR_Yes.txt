            My best friend just bought a 2001 model S2000.  We went ad drove Boxster Ss� and MZ3s  but after it was all said ad done the S2000 was the toy of choice.  Why you ask? In a word, Purity.  The S2000 is probably the purest of breed in terms of small roadsters with the BMW in close second and the Boxster running dead last.  

Know I know what you thinking �how can this little Honda hold a candle to the much popularized Porsche?�  Lets look at these cars point by point and you will begin to understand why I don�t agree with R&T or C&D magazines.  

The Boxster S is probably the prettiest of these three roadsters.  Its lines are seductive and sleek.  When you arive in a Porsche you have arrived in style and comfort.  Start the Boxster (or any Porsche) and you are greeted with a growl that is a cross between a mountain lion and grizzly bear.  It�s a sound that makes Corvettes throughout the neighborhood run for cover.  The Boxster also has an interior that is geared to the driver and the passenger. Stereo controls and instruments are well laid out but then that is sort of the problem, there is a lot going on in this car.  The eyes are drawn everywhere searching for the right button to push or knob to turn.   The Boxters fatal flaw is power.  It is the 911s younger sibling and as such it really lacks much of it�s own personality.  Don�t get me wrong it�s not a bad car, but for half the cost the S2000 wins.

BMWs little Z3 powerhouse is the M model.  This is probably the purest retro-roadster on the road today.  The body style and gauge placement scream 1960s cool!  Many of this cars parts come from it�s older brother the M3.  This gives it much of the driving feel of the M3 but with a smaller footprint and far less weight.  I actually like to drive this car more than the S2000 simply because it has the V6 and offers more power in the lower RPMs.  Also, I am kinda� partial to the huge brakes that allow this car to stop at will no matter what the speed.  This car is simply a joy to drive.  It is fast, it corners like it has a oneness with the road and when you pull up next to a Boxster S and beat it of the line by almost half a second you can take great satisfaction that you paid about $15K less.  That is the best part for me.  
  
In this age of technology and purity it is uncommon to find a car that is as true to its spirit as the S2000.  At first I did not like this car very much.  Yes, it has an incredibly silky smooth 6-speed gearbox, but when driving you really don�t feel the power surge until you get to the upper RPMs.  I was nervous about this because I had visions of little pieces of cylinder heads popping up tough the hood (luckily there are only 4 of them).  Much to my amazement when I got to 9000 RPM the car just begged for more, and no matter how fast I was going I could speed up or downshift without fear or hesitation the car just seemed to say �Thank you sir may I have another�.  Another peeve of mine was the interior.  Talk about Spartan, there is a stereo and the main cluster that�s it! Nothing more nothing less, but then I drove around for a day.  Everything is controlled from your fingertips.  Weather your starting the car (with the gimmicky start button) or you are changing the radio station your hands will never need to leave the comfort of the steering wheel. Once I realized this, I was converted.  It is truly what every speed hungry, middle aged guy needs a small fast car that wont cost you (all of) your kids college money.   I will say I am still not crazy about the body styling by day the lines are a little hard on my eyes, but at night that instrument cluster is a work of technological art, and the xenon headlights light up the road better than any car I have ever driven.  

The S2000 has more than the soul of a race car, it is a race car pure and simple.  Put a helmet on and your ready for the track.  While this little beast will haul *ss, it won�t haul golf clubs, groceries, or much else.  Like the flight attendants tell you �if it doesn�t fit in the overhead compartment, your luggage will need to be checked at the gate�.   I will also say I can�t wait until we are at a stop light with a Porsche and a BMW.  We will easily be able to keep up or surpass either of them and still afford get away for a golf weekend with our wives with the savings (of course, we won�t be going in the S2000).
