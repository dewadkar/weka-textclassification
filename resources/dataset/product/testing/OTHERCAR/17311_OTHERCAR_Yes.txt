            The 2001 Malibu has many standard features for a lower priced mid-sized sedan.  Although it is not as refined as an Accord, it is a good "bang for the buck."  We originally were looking at the Civics, Neons, and Cougars and were not planning at looking at the Malibus until we saw that Chevrolet was offering big rebates on the 2001 models.  The lure of saving more money brought us to take a test drive. The Malibu base model comes standard with an automatic V6 in the 2001 models. In addition, it offers standard ABS brakes, A/C, and power door locks.  Other mid-sized sedans would price over $19500 with all of these options.  The Malibu that we test drove only had two additional options, a CD player and floor mats.  That was enough for us. The ride is very smooth and quiet, which was a big change from our 1993 Chevy Cavalier.  The Malibu had enough power (170 hp) to pick up and go and a very smooth transmission. The trunk space is more than adequate although the base model does not come with the 60/40 split seats.  The back seat has enough space for an average sized adult to sit behind the driver's seat comfortably and there is plenty of head room in front seat and back. The CD player came equipped with RDS, which is an interesting feature that offers convenience. There are four cup holders and plenty of storage space in the center console and glove compartment.  The driver's seat only moves forward and back and reclines, and is within easy reach of all the controls (radio, A/C).  The arm rest on the driver's side sometimes makes it difficult to comfortably hold the steering wheel while resting the left arm for long periods of time.  The rest of the seats are very comfortable.  The back seat offers three child seat anchors, two shoulder belts and one middle lap belt.  The Malibu also comes with child safety door locks.  The biggest con was not from the car itself but the dealer who wanted to charge $1600 for an alarm, tint, lojack (yes, a lojack for a Malibu), and protection package "deal." We declined the "deal" and spent a few bucks on an aftermarket alarm and tint.
