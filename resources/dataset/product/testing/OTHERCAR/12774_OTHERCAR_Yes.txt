              I purchased a base model red dodge stealth on 12/04/00, and I have no regrets. It handles like a dream. The interior is a perfect balance of looks and comfort. The rear seats are kind of a joke though, ( even my 8 year old cousin complains about leg room). The driver and front passenger seats are both very comfortable though, and all controls are easy to reach. Since December I have had absolutely no problems with it as the odometer reaches close to 100k.
  The exterior turns a lot of heads, and is not much like any other vehicle. The stealth is actually very big on safety as well. It scores five stars for driver side and three stars for passenger in front impact collisions. I figure that the difference is due to a drivers side only airbag. Mine is a manual transmission,  which of course can be tedious in rush hour traffic but makes a very large difference in performance. But if you prefer an automatic transmission they are equipped with a button which will adjust the car from "power" to "economy". In turn this adjusts how high of rpm the car will shift at.
  If you are considering buying one I would suggest the "es" or "rt"(non turbo) both of these are powered by 222HP DOHC N/A (naturally aspirated) motors. Which means lots of less money in repairs due to no turbo chargers or all wheel drive transmission. The base model is equipped with a 164HP SOHC N/A motor. Which is also very reliable. But if you really have performance in mind and have a large pocketbook to pay for repairs the RT TT (twin turbo) comes stock with 320HP and AWD (all wheel drive)-very nice.
  I hope this was helpful in finding the right stealth for you.
