            Our 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan SE has been a disappointment from the beginning. The rear passenger window was detached from the mechanism that operates it when we got the van home.  After about 6 months, the speedometer and temperature gauge began failing about 75% of the time.  After numerous visits to the Dodge dealer, these instruments still do not work all of the time.  

The radio has already had to be replaced.  Of course, this was not still under warranty.  (Has anyone else noticed that as soon as the warranty runs out on a vehicle or appliance the trouble usually begins?) 

It is a strange feeling to be cruising down the highway at 60 miles per hour and look down at your speedometer which says you are going 0 miles per hour.

It had been 10 years since we had bought a new vehicle.  This was a big step for my husband and me to commit to a $500-a-month car payment.  To say we were in &quot;sticker shock&quot; is an understatement when we began looking for a new vehicle.  We researched the Consumer Guide for vehicles and the Dodge Caravan was #1 on safety.  And, with 3 children, that's what we were most interested in.

I can say, without a doubt, that our purchase has been a disappointment. <br><br>
