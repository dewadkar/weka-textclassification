            I originally was looking to purchase the Audi A4, but the price of the vehicle made me swing the other way. It is basically the same exact car with a differnt manufacturers name for less money.  Go figure!! I love the way the car handles and of course a German manufactured car speaks for itself on its reliability and they way which it was built.  I have had the car for about 8 months now and had nothing but happiness(I especially love the heated seats... they heat your back too!!).  Who should buy this vehicle? Well if you are looking at an Audi I believe that you should seriously consider the Passat.  Why pay more when you can get the basically the same car. Save the money and if you feel so inclined, send some of it to me!  If you purchase a Passat it is almost guaranteed happiness. Happy driving...<br><br>
