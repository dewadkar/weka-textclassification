            The 2001 Passat is fun and cute.  It has a fabulous ride and has superb seats, offering firm support in just the right places.  Acceleration with the 1.8T and manual transmission is adequate though a little noisy on acceleration.  Handling is precise and nimble, but there is significant body roll on turns which does detract from the driving experience for the aggressive driver.  The road feel is always quite good.  

The car has plenty of versatile passenger and cargo space.  Fold down seats are great for toting skis and snowboards.  The trunk is cavernous.  Tons of headroom and legroom in the front and back.  

On the downside, the manual transmission is very very finicky, sensitive to ambient temperature changes.  It's crunchy on shifting, especially when it's cold.  A few strange electrical quirks have come and gone spontaneously.  After the first few months, several squeaks and rattles developed, which is disappointing.    

The VW service departments do try to be respectful of their customers.  This is important as Passats and their owners spend a lot of time at the VW service dept.
