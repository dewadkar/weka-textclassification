            We purchased a '97 new with the 4 cyl. engine we have gotten up to 35 mpg on trips where it has been mostly highway mileage, in the eastern mountain ranges. 

Control arm systems are bad '97 model.  The originals were replaced with a redesigned control arm and we haven't had much problems since as long as we don't jack up the car. The front end seems a little weak. The car gets squeaky every time a jack up the car to rotate the tires what the *^&amp;^*.

Overall for the price paid for the vehicle it is nice transportation without spending a fortune. It has some nice features that are standard and I plan on driving it to the ground hopefully for many years to come. I like the ride it gives and is a nice car overall.<br><br>
