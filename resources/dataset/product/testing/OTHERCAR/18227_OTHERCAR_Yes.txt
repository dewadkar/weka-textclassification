            I bought my Integra GS new 2 years ago.  My biggest complaint is that either I'm too tall (6') or the car is too small.

I love the style, and it appears I'm not alone.  Acura is going on 8 years now without making any major changes in appearance or performance.  The average is 4 years.  It has great lines and a sporty look.

If I was to do it over, I would have put out the extra cash and bought the GS-R.  It has 170 hp VTEC vs. the 140 hp of the GS.  At the time I didn't realize how much a difference it makes.  

One serious drawback I find with it is the fact it dents by simply looking at it.  Next time you look at one of these on the road, you will almost certainly notice many door dings.  It's just going to happen.

As far as my earlier statement about how much room is in there, here goes.  With the seat all the way reclined and the back nearly in a laying position I can sit without hitting my head on the sunroof.  Maybe I lose some headroom because of the sunroof, but the fact remains I'm nearly laying down in this car.  Forget the fact that there is a back seat and consider this car a two-seater.  Unless you have children or small adults in the back the rear seats are almost useless.  The cargo trunk is a joy though.  It opens up like a giant clam and I can fit nearly anything in there.  We fit a 32&quot; TV in the box back there.  Every time I say &quot;no that won't fit&quot; this car manages to do it.  

I have the 5-speed and off the line it lacks.  It has little torque and doesn't hit it's peak util about 3500 or more RPM.  It corners great and feels very responsive.  You can feel a lot of bumps in the road though.  I would say it's somewhere between a Honda Civic and a Honda Prelude as far as feel and performance.  It actually bears a strong similarity to the earlier Prelude.  It has anti-lock brakes that I have tested first hand and do the job nicely.  

As far as comfort goes, the leather seats have become more comfortable over the years.  The interior is certainly not luxury level, But pleasing to look at and goes with the feel of the car.  There is a lot of road noise however.  And it can become quite a bumpy ride depending on the road.  

Overall it's a good car.  I upgraded from a 1988 Honda CRX.  I guess I can best describe it and sum it up like this.  I LOVED my CRX and I like my Integra a lot.
