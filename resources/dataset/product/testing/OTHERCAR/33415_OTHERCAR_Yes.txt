            <b>22,000+ Miles Later</b>
Yes, I still love my Jetta! That's why I've only had it a little over a year and already pushing close to 23,000 miles. The few problems I have are minor.

� I find that the cup holders are not in the most logical place (above the        radio?), not only will a spill be disastrous (liquid and electronics make me nervous, but that's just me) and putting a tape or CD in while your cup of java in the the holder is a feat only David Copperfield could do.

� The little hesitation I get, the dealer says it's normal. I have to believe them because what do I know. I have to say it bugs me.

Besides those two, I have to say I still love my car!


<b>Beautiful, Shiny, and New</b> that is what my Jetta is and I tell you I'm in love w/ it. 

But before you get it make sure they fix the seat belt-something about it causing a fire because it has a motor in it. I'm not sure exactly what the problem is but be aware that a problem lurks.

Okay, I love my car, the purple lights that come on dash are too cool, the ride is super smooth, it doesn't guzzle gas, and the warranty-oh the warranty. Ten years/100,000 miles you can't beat that.

The only thing is mine seems to hesitate sometimes when I try to accelerate and I don't think that I'm pushing the petal to the metal but I can't say that its a Jetta thing or a my car thing. I don't recall it happening in my test drive. Any one w/ a 99 Jetta feel free to email me at tee_na@mailexcite.com w/ comments. 

This car has a huge trunk and the back seats full forward making it super easy to haul stuff around. My sister with a sports utility asked my to help her move the stuff see couldn't fit in her car.

One final note: Even though I love my Jetta and am raving about it, I do not recommend you get one (especially in<i> black</i>). There are way too many on the road and every time I see one, I feel a little less special.
