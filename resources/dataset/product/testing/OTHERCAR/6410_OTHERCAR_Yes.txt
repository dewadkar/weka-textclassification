            I have a grey '87 Cutlass which I am using.  It was originally my dad's, but due to disease he can no longer drive.  I used it last year to get to high school and now to college.

I would have to say I love this car.  Mine hasn't been driven much, and has 95k miles on it, which is considerably low for a 16-year old car.  If I weren't saving up to buy a new van for my business, I would try to locate another Cutlass in good condition when this one finally gives out.

GAUGES - PRO: Always a good thing.  Shows speed and fuel (obvoiusly), temparature, oil pressure, and battery.  The tachometer is great, even though mine is automatic.  Gauges are always better than lights coming on to warn you AFTER you have a problem.

GAUGES - CON: The SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT remains on all the time.  It goes on about a day after you get the filters and insides cleaned.  The solution?  Unplug the connector and forget it.

STYLE - PRO: I think the body shape makes this car stylish whether you're in a town, city, or wherever.  They made this model from the early 70s up until around 1990.  It was a timeless design then, but now it sticks out like a sore thumb if it's not cleaned up good.  Otherwise, it looks really sharp, especially with pinstriping!  

STYLE - CON:  Take off the hubcaps and it looks like you're from a bad 'hood.  I have had plenty of kids in my high school tell me it looks like a drug-dealer's car, and it actually does a bit.  People will always cut you off if you drive slow.  Is it ghetto or geezer?

RELIABILITY: This car gets me where I want to go and I can still depend on it.  The only replacements were a muffler, a water pump last year.

Good driving, but it sucks up gas like there's no tomorrow.

HANDLING - PRO: Steering is really good.  It can turn sharply without rolling over like too many SUVs, and it will stop when you need to.

HANDLING - CON: Slow acceleration.  My town is more or less on top of a mountian.  If I'm on Route 280 I can floor it all I want, and I'm still doing only about 45 MPH.  Seriously.  But I personally don't like to drive fast anyway, so it isn't a problem for me.

COMFORT - PRO: You can get motorized chairs!  Fun to play with, but it will break.

ROOMINESS - PRO: BIG BIG trunk that you can fit pieces of furniture like drawchests and console TVs in (believe me, I've done it).  The back is very roomy, such that if you take a girlfriend to lover's lane, there will be no complaints.  The front provides good footroom as well.

Waether problem...  If it's cold, you're not getting to school or wherever you need to be on time, unless you're out there a half-hour beforehand letting the beast warm up.  Set the choke, then give it gas every three seconds or it will stall and you will have to wait all over again.

Another bad point was in the mid-1990s before I started driving, the factory recalled a bolt that would cause the entire A-frame to break apart if this bolt came loose.  Nice thing to keep in the back of your mind, right?

Overall it is a good machine and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a car but doesn't need to go long distances.  Good for kids liek me because it won't cost much to insure and if you're paying for college and other expenses, it won't be too much to maintain.  It's a good first car.
