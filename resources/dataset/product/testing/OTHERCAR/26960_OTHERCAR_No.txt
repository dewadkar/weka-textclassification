            The guys at Enterprise thought that they were doing me a favor when they gave me a 2000 Mitsubishi Galant ES (32000 miles on the odometer) for the price of a Cavalier.    But they weren't.....

When I my wife and I first sat in the car, we were both impressed.  Compared with the disappointingly chintzy 2001 Camry we had rented a couple of weeks previously (no review--I drove it less than 100 miles), the Galant felt almost luxurious.  Rather than cheap-looking straight lines like the Camry, the Galant was padded and curved on the inside--quite nice.  The seats were comfy, and the around-town handling was quite pleasant.

Then we took the car to Reno.  120 miles over a mountainous (and relatively curvy) interstate is enough to separate the men from the boys, as it were.  The Galant wasn't a man.  It wasn't a boy.  I'm not sure it was even an embryo.  What it was is a car that you don't want to buy.

First of all, it had no power.  The 2.4 liter four-cylinder engine, although fine for around town and reasonable highway cruising, was useless climbing hills at freeway speed.  We had trouble sustaining 70 mph on slight grades (less than 5%) at low altitudes.  Imagine how much worse it was on steep grades at higher altitudes.  Or, rent one, and you won't need to imagine--you'll have more than adequate time to form your own opinions.  We finally figured out that the only way to maintain speed on the hills was to keep the automatic transmission in third gear at all times--and keep it under 70 mph.  This didn't bode well for our gas mileage, which ran around 22-25 mpg--not good for a V4 on the freeway.  To its credit, it downshifted when I stomped on the gas, but it didn't let the car run to redline--it upshifted at least 500 rpm shy of redline, robbing me of much needed power.

The handling was a bit terrifying.  I cannot exactly put my finger on what was wrong, but it never inspired confidence.  It felt unsafe to take curves at any more than 10 mph over the posted speed limit, like the car was on the verge of going out of control.  It isn't that there was a lot of body lean, and the car wasn't seriously out of alignment--it just felt unsteady.

The driving experience is not the only thing to complain about in the Galant.  The in-dash CD player's sound is disappointing--decent treble, limited bass, but very little midrange, and it seemed a bit skip happy on a disc that plays fine in our 1997 Pathfinder.  The HVAC system, although quite potent, has little LED's for the most important features (recirculated air and A/C compressor) which wash out and become unreadable in direct sunlight.  Worst of all, the road noise is deafening.  Driving at reasonable speed (65-70 mph) over chewed-up pavement, my wife and I had to raise our voices to engage in conversation.  Although some of the blame for this can probably be laid on the cheapie no-name tires that Enterprise put on the car (they looked quite new for a car with 30k+ miles), there's still no excuse for the quantity of noise that we had to put up with.  One other complaint.... The placement of the window lock button on the driver's door is so high that if you find yourself pressing it a lot (quite likely if you are hauling a family), you will end up rubbing the fabric door inserts bald.

Here's the good news....  Although the car has had about 32000 very hard rental miles on it, it seems to be holding up very well.  The only thing that I can find that is wrong is that the dome light switch has gotten a bit touchy.  Other than that, the engine has no funny noises, it's aligned, and the doors close well.  Better than the American cars we've rented for sure.

How about cost?  At $18942 sticker for the 2001 version, the Galant is about $2000 cheaper than a Camry LE and about $1000 cheaper than an Accord LX and may be marginally cheaper.  Edmunds.com prices a used 2000 Galant at about $13k ($15,400 for an Accord and $16k for a Camry).  That's a lot of depreciation.

Bottom line.... The car is relatively good in town.  It is comfortable and adequate in every way.  It is fine for short distance driving on short-flat highways.  Anything more challenging, though, is outside the realm of its capabilities.  Forget about it for road trips.  And think twice about it for in-town driving....
