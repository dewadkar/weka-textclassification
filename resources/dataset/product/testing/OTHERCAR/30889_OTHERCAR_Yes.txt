             I've had mine for a few weeks now and really love it. I've been on snow and ice and it feels very stable though I wish there was a switch (like the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute has) to lock in the AWD. It feels much bigger inside than it looks outside. Power is fine for me even though it is only a 4 cylinder. The engine is surprisingly quiet and the transmission is the smoothest auto I've ever had. This vehicle will be great for camping! The seats fold into a lumpy bed for 2 or they can be folded up out of the way (or removed all together) leaving room for two 6 footers to sleep with the hatch closed. There are accessory curtains to use for camping. The floor and seats just wipe clean. BTW, even though they are targeting this for young males I think all ages and both sexes will enjoy it. I'm 46 and my wife loves driving it too. The ride is smooth on good roads but jiggled on bumpy roads (though very stable).It handles very nice for a tall vehicle. Really a fun vehicle! BTW this is a 2003 model (there was no option to select other than 2002 when I wrote this).
