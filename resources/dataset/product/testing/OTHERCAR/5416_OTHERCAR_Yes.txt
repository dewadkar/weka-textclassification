            I consider this camera to be a handy little item.  It's a great starting place for anyone new to digital photography, or if you're like me, the perfect point and shoot accessory for anyone who might not want to take their Nikon 950 rock climbing.  

It has a decent zoom feature, takes a good quality photo, and uploads easily to a PC.  While it still tends to eat up batteries fairly quickly, as is the case with most digital cameras, this can be remedied by investing in a good set of rechargeables.  

My recommendation mainly stems from its ease of use and its reasonable price.  You can take it to parties and family gatherings and let people check it out, pass it around, and take a bunch of photos that everyone can view instantly, just like in the days when the Polaroid ruled.  However, unlike then, everyone else doesn't make off with your pictures, you don't spend a fortune on film, and the smiles extend beyond the weekend when anyone who wants a copy can be e mailed one on Monday morning.  

Priced below $400, it's not as big of a risk to hand it over to an uncle or a buddy, who otherwise might make you think twice about the damage they could do by dropping it.  It's fun, it's simple, and it takes a good shot.  <br><br>
