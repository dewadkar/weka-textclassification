            I bought this vehicle because of it's safety awards and the AWD without the height of a SUV.  The power is ok, good enough to merge on freeways, and it handles more like a car than a SUV.  What I hate about this vehicle is the flimsyness of the materials (Ex: visor, arm rest, cup holders).  In the first year the a/c wouldn't work, and it had to be shipped from japan which took over 5 months.  Then the head gasket went and was promptly replaced by warranty, then it went again also replaced by warranty.  Both wheel bearings went twice from 1998 to 2000.  For $36000 CAD, I think this vehicle should have better quality then this!<br><br>
