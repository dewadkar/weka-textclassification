            I recently purchased a 2000 Hyundai Elantra.  It was out of necessity that I bought a new car, but I didn't have a problem accepting the keys to the Elantra once I had test driven it.  It is small enough to give me more than adequate gas mileage, yet large enough to accommodate my family of four.  It handles highway driving extremely well and it's acceleration is exceptional.  I particularly like two features the car has:  1) The cruise control system is really easy to use, requiring the driver to push only two buttons.  2)  The automatic (T-shift) transmission is fun and convenient.  (However, if you're used to a standard stick, try to remember that when you get into the Elantra, it's an automatic.)
About the only thing I don't like about the Elantra is that it is light weight.  If you have to drive on dirt roads for any reason, it doesn't handle soft dirt or mud very well.
I would recommend this automobile to new buyers, or perhaps college students, but anyone would like driving the Elantra.  It is simply a fun car to drive, gets you where you want to go, and provides you with good, inexpensive transportation.
