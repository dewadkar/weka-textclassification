            Having always wanted a convertible, I finally decided in 1996 that this car provided me an affordable way to get one. 4.5 years latter I still enjoy driving it. I've had only one repair that I've had to make in all of that time and it was under warranty. This car is an excellent buy for the price. It's relatively quick compared to the competition: Sebring and Volkswagon Cabrio. It also is one of only 2 production convertibles that have 5 seatbelts, making it good for getting the family around town while having a little fun. 

Understand though that this is not a luxury car. While comfortable, the inside is a little plain. The stock stereo is nothing to write home about and the speaker placement is horrible. The handling on this car is a concern as well. The suspension is far too soft and you really have to slow down on curves. Also, now that the car is a few years old, the top isn't fitting the way it used to and I have to play with it a little bit to get it to close correctly. This isn't covered under warranty.

Overall though this car has been a great deal of fun, very reliable, and I plan on keeping it for a long, long time.<br><br>
