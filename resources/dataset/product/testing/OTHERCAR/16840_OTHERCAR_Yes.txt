            The CLK must be one of the hardest cars to get in the United States.  But why is it so popular, what makes it such a great car?  The Mercedes sports car has many features that make it such a great car.

Price
This car is one of the first affordable Mercedes that is good.  Priced at a low $40,000 it could be priced as high as $70000.  With so many great additions on the car, it is popular among most people.

Features
This car has a computer that will fix itself without you doing anything.  It's air conditioner is really great, no matter how powerful the fan is set to, the temperature will set at the same rate.  The key for the car is really neat too.  To open the car you just click a button, there is no keyhole.  The same is for the trunk, there is no keyhole.  This makes theft much harder with this car.  The rear window is the downside to this car, it is very small so backing up can be very hard.  The engine is quite powerful.  When going 70 mph, the engine will be working with ease.  It is like a light jog for it.
