            We just recently purchased a 2000 Frontier Desert Runner and are thoroughly pleased!  The truck is a 2wd up on a 4x4 frame....less expensive but still has the looks (and who needs 4x4 in Florida?)  The V6 engine is peppy and fun to drive.  The bucket seats are fairly comfortable but I do find that the head rests are shaped for taller folks.  I even enjoy driving it and find it comfortable (I'm a pretty short female).  The truck was reasonably priced 16K or so, and for the money was a good value.  

My husbands biggest complaint is the lack of rear speakers in the cab...and he wishes he'd sprung for the 4 door version!

Overall though, it rides fairly good for a truck, the manual transmission is easy to drive and shifts smoothly, the pep is there and the desert runner is a good alternative to the 4X4...it really is a sharp little truck!

Thumbs up, this one is a good value!
