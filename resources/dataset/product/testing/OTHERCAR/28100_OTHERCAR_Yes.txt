            As a person who never gets around to developing film, I thought a digital camera would be a great thing to have. I found this little guy at Walmart for under $200.00, and was impressed with what features it has.

 The resolution compares with much more expensive cameras. In fact, the only other cameras in this price range were only 640X480 or less. The results are clear and crisp, and if printed on photo paper, look just as good printed.

The only downside is the lack of a manual (on screen help is worthless if you're not taking pictures in the house), and the icons on the camera's menu aren't really user friendly. 

The color lcd screen is bright and sharp (except for outside in strong light), and the picture preview is handy. You can delete a shot instantly if it doesn't look right, and free up the memory for another picture. You can also hook this to your tv or vcr with the provided cable and preview pictures, save them on tape, or even use the camera as a low-quality cam-corder (if you don't mind filming all the action within a 5' radius of the vcr, due to cord length).

Also handy is the separate black and white lcd on the top of the camera. It has a battery level indicator, displays what resolution your pictures are in (Fine, Very Fine, and Normal), and how many shots are left in each mode. The higher the quality, the less shots the memory will hold. On the main menu (accessed on the color screen) you can set the quality to XGA or VGA, XGA being the best. So you end up having access to 6 different film quality settings, with XGA-Very fine being the best, and VGA-Normal being the lowest quality (but still very adequate). 

The flash mode indicator is also on the top lcd, off, on, and auto. Even inside you don't need to use the flash very often, due to the fact that you can also choose the available lighting level on the main menu (sunlight, lamp light, etc). The indoor shots I did use the flash on came out overexposed until I turned the flash completely off, then they were perfect.

I'd recommend this for anyone that wants a digital camera, but doesn't need all the high-end options on more expensive models.<br><br>
