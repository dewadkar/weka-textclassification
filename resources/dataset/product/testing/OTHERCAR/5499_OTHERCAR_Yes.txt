            The cavalier started production in 1982 with front-drive. Similar to the cavalier is the Pontiac's Sunbird and now the Sunfire. The Car was restyled in 1988. Three body styles where offered in 1990: hatchback coupe, sedan, and station wagon. No convertible was available at this time. The sporty Z24 coupe with V6 power targeted the youth market. Engines grew in size for 1990. A 2.2-liter four became the base engine, while a 3.1-liter V6 replaced the prior 2.8-liter as an option in wagons. Cavaliers got new seats for 1990, as well as passive front seatbelts and a stainless steel exhaust system. 
  
Details for years

1991: Instrument panels gained temperature and oil-pressure gauges. Receives a new facelift outside, and somewhat new interior. A convertible returned. Front and rear styling were new; so were headlamps and taillamps. Z24 came with a spoiler.  Tires went from 13- to 14-inch, while the Z24 went from 14-inch to 15-inch rubber. Rotary knobs replaced buttons and levers for the headlamps and wiper/washer. Coupes added door map pockets and could get a removable sunroof. 
1992: Antilock braking offered, 4-cylinder engine gained 15 horsepower, courtesy of a new fuel injection system. The Z24 convertible returned after a 2-year absence, joining the RS ragtop. 
1993: Convertibles now had plastic instead of glass for their back windows, and could now have a rear defogger installed. Previously optional only in station wagons, the V6 engine could now go into any RS model. 
1994: A stronger --ten more than before. Wagons now came in just one (unnamed) trim level. 120-horsepower base engine for 1994 models. Model receives a total redesign in 95.
Powertrain Options and A  I do enjoy the performance of my Z24  even though it is not the fastest thing on the road. It handles nicely around corners and with the 3.1 accelerates well. It makes a great first car or winter beater. It is reliable and cheap to fix if you don't take it to a dealer. Because of its simplicity it makes it easy to do home repairs. The 3.1 V6 is almost unbreakable. I drove it 3 days with a blown gasket. Coolant was leaking into the engine and I found out I had cracked two head bolts and a push rod and it still ran! It cost me about 1000 bucks to fix and should be good for another 150,000 kms I highly recommend buying the 93-94 Z24 models and staying away from the 4 cylinder models.


Problems I have had and key things to look for when buying.
 
At around 150-180,000 kms car hits its expiry date. Gas tank leaks, head gasket leaks, horn fails, washer fluid pump, alternator, power locks, door seal, and ignition switch all went within the same year.
Automatic transmission: automatic transmission shifts late or does not upshift at all. The problem is a stuck throttle valve inside the transmission. (1990-94) 
Ignition switch: The ignition switch may not return from the start to the run position and the accessories may not work because the screws that hold the switch in place were overtightened. (1991-94) 
Transaxle leak: The right front axle seal at the automatic transaxle is prone to leak. GM issued a revised seal to correct the problem. (1992-94)
Prone to rusting in near the corner of the rear window, where plastic moulding meets sheet metal and below doors.
On models 91-92 door seals leak, letting in water. This problems was fixed in 93 with an extra door seal above the door.
