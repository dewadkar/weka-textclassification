            As you may notice with my past reviews on my cars, I mentioned electrical. There are other problems with them but I'll get into that later. I'm not trying to put down Chrysler, I just want you to know about the inherent defects and dangers. There are many other makes and models I would not touch. I had a Dodge Spirit purchased as a rental return from the dealer. Great price and easy to get.
 I ended up using it as courier vehicle, two hundred miles per day. Beat the you know what out of it constantly. For the most part it was great. In my last months of driving it there were serious problems and I'll tell you in another column how great that engine is. During the summer I was  sitting waiting for work to head my way with everything turned off. When I went to start up the engine I smelled what seemed to be popcorn. I wasn't near any food. The smell grew worse. I saw smoke from my dash. The area behind the radio was burning. I was fortunate I wasn't in traffic yet and pulled over. I am glad I have a fire extinguisher in my car required by law for couriers. I put the fire out. What happened, you ask? For weeks after the entire system started to fail and I eventually replaced the entire wiring harness. I don't know what happened but it seems to carry through the other Plymouth products as well. Radios have failed on other ones. My old 89 van had the door locks  and radio fail. Etc. Of course this was not under warranty anymore. 
   Be careful around these things or you may lose you car as well.  <br><br>
