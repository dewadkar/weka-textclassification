            I purchased this car for a number of reasons. It was roomy enough for my family (myself,wife, son,dog), seemed like a fun vehicle to drive, and appeared to be very practicle.
I have not been disappointed. The CRV drives very much like a car and comfortably seats my entire family even on long trips.The split rear fold down seats are ideal for this family. Folding down one seat allows the dog to stretch out from the rear area into the back seat area without disturbing the other rear passenger. 
The CRV has plenty of leg and head room. This care is ideal for a small family.
The only real negative: lacks engine power, especially for passing and going up steep hills. <br><br>
