            Hello everyone, <br>This is to inform everyone about my opinion on the VW Jetta.<br>I bought my car in May of 99.  Its the new model.  The car runs and feels as good as it looks.  The drive is soo smooth, you cant feel it.  <br><br>What i love about this car is that, the way it rides..nice and smooth.  The dashboard lights are nice.  They are a neon blue with a neon red.  The steering wheel is good also. When you are driving you want to feel comfortable, and this car is comfortable.  The steering wheel doesn't only adjust up and down like all cars, you can also adjust it towards and away from you.  <br><br>Another thing i love about this car is how easy it is to adjust your seats.  Has anyone gone through the same thing i've gone through with the seats.?  Well let me give u an idea about what i'm talking about.  When you get in the car and you reach over the front to find the knob to move the seats forward and back.  Isn't it hard?  Isn't it a mission for you to find that knob to move the seat?  And then when you find it its soo hard to move.  Well it's not in this car.  When u reach forward the knob is right there under your seat.  On the right side.  You give it a gentle pull and the seat slides forward and backward. <br><br>Has anyone owned a car, that when they go shopping, their bags don't fit in the trunk and you have to put it in the back seat also??  I have.  But not this car.  The Jetta has the biggest trunk i have seen in a compact sized car.   And the best part is, you can't tell.  The car is a good size. Not too big, not too small.  Just perfect.   Everyone planning on buying a car, just give it a test drive, and you will not look anymore.  Its worth it. <br><br><br>
