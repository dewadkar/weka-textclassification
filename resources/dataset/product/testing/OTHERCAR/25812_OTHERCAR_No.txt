            I bought a Villager used (96 model) because of the way it drives. It feels almost like I am driving my Honda Civic! However, when our family packed up for our first weekend away in the Villager, we quickly were reminded that the small-car feel goes beyond the drive - our Dodge Caravan holds much more!

We also have experienced numerous electrical problems with this car, which we are told is not unusual. The horn beeps, the doors lock, things like that, without our intervention.

This is a nice car, but I would not rate it an exceptional car.<br><br>
