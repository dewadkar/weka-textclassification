            i am buying a new pt cruiser by chrysler when it comes out but i needed a sedan too for business purposes. i got lucky when i bought this fun little car. it is a 5 cylinder zippy little thing when in sport mode. it is fun to drive and has all the amenities. i was lucky enough to get a '91 with virtually no mileage and every option available for about 5 grand. the only issue is that it lacks ample space. if you plan on hauling things this is not the car for you. but if you want a fun car that gets great gas mileage (350-400 miles per tank) this car is a find.<br><br>
