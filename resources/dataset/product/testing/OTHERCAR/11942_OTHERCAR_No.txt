            I was pleased with the easy-to-use Agfa 780 until the LCD malfunctioned. I exchanged the camera for another of the same model, and again, within a month, the LCD malfunctioned and the camera stopped working altogether. I realize this might be a fluke, but what are the chances of two cameras of the same model malfunctioning in the same way? The cameras went through batteries very quickly too. For these reasons, I don't recommend this camera. I am disappointed that it malfunctioned because I really like the easy-to-use software that comes with the camera. For $200, it would be a great camera if I hadn't been doubly disappointed!<br><br>
