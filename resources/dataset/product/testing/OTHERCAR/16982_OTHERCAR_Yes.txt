            We like the Montana an awful lot.  Some of the things we like about the Montana are that it is very roomy with loads of storage space and it has many conveniences.  It has a very nice look to it and it drives like a sedan.  That's a real plus.  It is very steady on the road.  A couple of the things we don't like about it are the headrests are strange and not comfy at all.  The on/off button for the radio is well hidden by the steering wheel.  It makes it a little difficult to locate it in a second while driving.  The cd player is a bit quirky and skips a lot while in use.  It has no tape player which is too bad.

When you turn the van off and take the keys out of the ignition, the radio/cd player stays on until you open the driver side door and the interior lights (nice and bright) come on.  Great feature!  

Other than these few things, it is a fabulous vehicle which is a great family vehicle and very easy to use and get used to.  We like it a lot!
