            I would consider myself an amateur-wanna-be-but-may-never-be-professional photographer.  I look at cameras from that perspective so I try to push them to the limits of their abilities.  I want the Canon D30 but must be satisfied with the D-460Z.  And I am pleased, indeed. 

It's not that it's so great for taking pro quality pictures.  It's not but still does a fine job.  After all it IS a point and shoot style camera.  But you can squeeze close to pro quality out of it with a little care and attention.  It does take clear pictures that are sharper than you might expect from a 1.2 megapixel camera.

I have taken all manner of pictures including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and simple family snaps.  If you are looking to brush up your skills, have a nice point-and-shoot which allows you to upload pictures to a service for printing (no more trips to the grocery store photo center), one that gives you instant feedback about the picture you just took (an addicting feature that view screen) or just want to delve into experimentation with the digital world of photography this is a good camera at a good price (shop around, prices seem to vary quite a bit).  You can use it as a beginner and still have room to grow into it.

It would be wise to upgrade the 8MB smartmedia card to 16 or 32MB card.  This will allow you to shoot in the Super High Quality (SHQ) mode and get around 36 and 73 (respectively) pictures without having to offload them.  This mode seems to be where you get the best out of your pictures without the resulting images being too big to manage.

I shot a nice portrait of my wife in SHQ mode and blew it up to 8x10.  The sharpness and clarity of the 8x10 print is excellent and there is no noticeable pixelation even on the defined edges within the image.  As may be obvious to some, enlarging to 11x14 probably wouldn't be an option with this camera.  The resolution would need to be higher although I have not tried to do so in the SHQ TIFF mode (which is SHQ but instead of JPEG/compressed format, it is saved uncompressed as a TIFF). You can get about 2 of these high res images on the 8 MB card, 8 or 9 on the 32MB card...these suckers are huge.

SHQ images overall tend to be around 300-400 KB size range.  Not too bad to work with and if you are using the serial cable to download them to your PC, it doesn't take too long.

Some things I would get or change.

I would like to see a time exposure longer than 1/2 second.  Although I think the CCD (the sensitive part that captures the picture) wouldn't be able to handle it necessarily.  Not sure though.  Just a wish.

Get the Sandisk SmartMedia reader.  It saves a hell of a lot of time with downloading images and is simple to use.  This might be a better investment than and AC adapter if you are considering that to save batteries during download.

Get the NiMH (Nickel-Metal Hydride) rechargable batteries and a charger.  Other reviews are right.  This thing LOVES batteries.  The lithium batteries that come with it lasted a long time for me with average use but they tend to be pricey so rechargables may be your best bet.  MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT ONES! Read the part in the manual about the specific kind of battery you need before going out and getting them.  There are A LOT of different kinds out there so be sure of what you are getting.  I found some from Panasonic that have functioned well.

Enjoy it.  That's what the point is.

I hope this was helpful.
