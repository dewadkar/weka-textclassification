            This camera is the third digital camera I have used. The others being an old Sony .5 megapixel one that used floppy disks and the Toshiba PDR-M4. I was so impressed with my PDR-M4 that I decided to give the PDR-M5 a shot. I was not disappointed.

It captures all of the features of the M4, improves some, and adds others. Although slightly larger, the zoom lens makes up for that loss. The pictures still look very good, even though a bit yellow at times. The software that comes with it is perfectly capable of removing most of the yellowness that occurs occasionally. Also, the JPEG movie option of the M4 was replaced with AVI capability. A definite improvement is that the movies are now viewable easily outside the camera. 

On the downside (the small downside), this camera drains batteries just as fast as the M4, so you might want to purchase a new battery. The powerful CPU causes this power drain. This CPU is the reason that the camera is almost as fast as a film camera, so the battery drain is no fault of the camera.

Also, the camera takes such high-resolution pictures that the included 8MB card is rarely enough if you want all your pictures at the highest quality. You might want to replace it with a 32MB card as I did right away. 

The only real downfall of the camera is the hefty price tag. It retails very high, but it can be purchased at buy.com for about $530 last I checked. This price is lower than any other place on the web I could fine (even Ebay). If you want this camera be sure to check buy.com to see if the price is still low.

All in all this is my favorite camera I've ever owned. I'd recommend it to anyone.
