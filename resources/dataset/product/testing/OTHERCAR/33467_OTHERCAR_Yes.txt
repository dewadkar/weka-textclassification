            I love this car! I have a 1991 Chevy Cavalier convertible. I have been in a couple of wrecks, and the other cars looked like they were hit by a tank, and my car just walked away with a cracked headlight. I even accidentally drove it over a cinderblock/wooden plank fence, and nothing happened to it! As long as you love it and do correct maintenence on it, it will love you back. My car is 9 years old and my family was the original owners. It has 80,000 miles and I have only had to replace the alternator, and that was this September (1999). 

The only bad thing I can say about this car is that it is a little cramped, but it is a convertible, and it seems they like to make them to be small and sporty- it's backseat is for show only! In other words, this will not make a good family car because it is a two door. The doors are heavy and it is very hard to get things (including people) out of the backseat. It is also a little noisy due to its convertible feature. But, it makes an adorable car that will give you its heart and do all it can for you. It has spent 6 years without a garage, and it still starts and goes without a problem. And, it does not leak! I love it! (Mine is named Candy after its candy red color :) )
