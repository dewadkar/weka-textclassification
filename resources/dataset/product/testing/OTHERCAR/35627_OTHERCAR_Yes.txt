            I am seventeen years old so when my dad told me that I would be driving a chevy malibu I wasn't so happy.  We got a real good deal.  With a trade in we got a 98 with 26k for only $11,000. I used to drive an old chevy cavilier and compared to that old piece, this car is a dream.  I have a dark red 1998 Malibu LS and I love it.  It is very easy to drive, and with a V6 it is very fast and very powerful.  Often I find myself on the highway doing 80 and not even realizing it.  The care, because it has a large engine, gobbles up gas.  I get about 220 miles on a full tank.  The car's interior is very nice and there are options to get the car with a CD player.  The sound system is very good and my car came with a theft deterant system.  Overall, I really like the 1998 Malibu LS<br><br>
