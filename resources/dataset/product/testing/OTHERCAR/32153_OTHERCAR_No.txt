            While looking for a replacement for my aging 94 Geo Metro, I came across an advertisment for Daewoo. I decided to add this to my list of cars to drive. I picked a Lanos sedan with all the options. I was initially impressed with the list of standard features and price. However, after driving the car, my opinion changed rather dramatically. First, I needed to put the seatback of the drivers seat back. There is this round knob that I had a very difficult time turning in order to set the seat back. My hand barely fit and ended up crushing my watch.  The interior seat material was a very strange pattern and color.  The dash and trim looked like it was made from melted plastic army men. Bottom line is it looked and felt very cheap. On the road, the engine seemed underpowered. The only real bright spot was the car handled exceptionally well. If only they had a more powerful engine and had used a bit more upgraded materials in the interior, this car might be more of a challenger to Nissan, Toyota, Honda,  etc. I also didn't care for the No Haggle policy on the price of the vehicle. I can get a decked out 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE for about $1500 more than the Lanos and get a car that the Lanos cant hold a candle to.
