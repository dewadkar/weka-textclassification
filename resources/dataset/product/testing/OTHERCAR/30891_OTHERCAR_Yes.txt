            Ok, I have had my Honda Elephant for a week and I love it.  The name came from my son and seems to fit.  It is such an unusual, goofy, weird looking, ugly car that it is cute in spite of itself.  I purchased the EX model with standard shift, and it is fun to drive.  However, the engine seems to rev high.  I am sure it is designed to do that, but I think this car would benefit from a 6th gear for highway driving.  Going down the highway at 80 mph in 5th gear puts the engine at about 4000 rpm, which gives you great control, but seems a bit like a waste of gas to me.

I love this car because it is basic and simple to use with out a lot of extra stuff cluttering up the dashboard, doors and other spaces.  Some people will feel ripped off without these extras.  To me, it is just less stuff to break and have to repair later.

No rugs! What a concept.  Who wants a rug in their car?  Whose stupid idea was that anyway?  This vehicle, true to Honda style, is so well designed and engineered, and makes so much sense that once you get past the weird form factor, you can't help but appreciate it.

I have to admit I don't get the rear sunroof yet, although I have not taken a nap in it yet either.
