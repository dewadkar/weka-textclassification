            My family buys Chevys. NO, not Chevrolets.  They buy Chevys.  It's a clear-cut distinction in the attitude we take to our form of conveyance.
In late 1992, my father bought my mother this huge, lumbering 92 Caprice Classic for her birthday for $15,000.  Real cheap cuzz it was a program car.
I eventually inherited it due to the impending death of my 6 cylinder cavalier s.w.
The car is now over 9 years old, it has over 163,000 miles on it and it's still a workhorse.  It's not a 100% reliable workhorse, but it's valiant.
Since about 1997, it's had a/c problems, alignment issues, auto window quirks, oil seal situations and other driver-end neglect maintenance shortcomings.  I've had to replace some electrical cables, oil pressure gauges, the entire fuel pump and various hoses.  
Currently, it's got a leaky rear oil ring leak, a broken heater core (smelly coolant leak), and a perpetual service engine soon light.
I'm spending at least $200 every 2-4 months to keep it going.
It may seem like this car isn't worth it.  But some of it's shortcomings can be blamed on me.  Within the past 4 years, I've learned to religiously have the oil changes every 3,000 miles.  I check all the fluids on a weekly basis.  I listen for strange sounds and odd feelings.  I guess I'm more responsible.  I have to be.  It's the only car I've got.
Amazingly enough, this V-8 gets great mileage at about 400-420 miles per 22 gallon tank.  I used to get 450.
My (name omitted to protect myself) once drove about 3 miles with the oil tank empty.  It was allowed to cool down and was given some quarts of oil.  It started without a problem.

A true workhorse.

They don't make'em like this anymore.
