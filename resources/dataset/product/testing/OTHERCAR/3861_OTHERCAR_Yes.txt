            I bought this vehicle used with 47K miles on it in 2002. Would not buy it new as it is too pricey new. But it depreciates fast in the first few years so I recommend picking a vehicle coming off-lease from a reputable dealer if you want to save some money. 

Has been reliable to a "T" over the past 25000 miles ( I have 72K on it as of 7/2003). I have changed the oil every 3-4K and you do need get the steering linkage grease points lubricated every 5-7K. I am going to need a front brake job soon....Hence my only major negative point about the truck.It just needs bigger brakes to slow it down but fortunately it is not an expensive maintainance item. It leaks a drop of oil now and then from the rear transfer case but that I am not worried about unless it gets worse prior to 100K miles which I should be getting close to next year.My mechanic checked that out and validated that assessment.

My family prefers to go on all roadtrips in it...even though we have a full size Euro station wagon and sedan those are not as comfortable as the Yukon's "Lazy Boy" recliner ride on long hauls. The two power captain's chairs up front are very comfortable.(arm rests could be bigger) The rear bench holds three comfortably. A lot of cargo room behind the rear bench. If one folds that rear bench down then the rear becomes a cavern! I have helped a friend move a 6 foot couch that fit in there with room to spare for a lot of other stuff and the rear barn doors closed fully.

Good visibility with all that glass in all directions except the rear visbility is slightly obstructed due to the barn doors. 

The gas mileage could be better but if one looks at the YUKON and expects it is going to be frugal on gas then I would recommend looking at other vehicles.A tank of gas takes a whopping 29.5 gallons to fill. But I do get about 15-17 miles to the gallon. I use regular gasoline and that seems to suit it fine. Tried premium for about a month and that did not result in any performance improvement so I stick with the regular.

Engine power and transmission are great.Acceleration for a big truck is very good; I estimate it does 0-60mph in about 8.5 seconds. It is not a slow poke and cruises at effortlessly at highway speeds with comfortable passing power. The engine starts and transmission shifts smoothly even on the coldest winter days after it has been sitting outside all night in sub 10F weather.It came with the tow package and I have towed 5000lbs with it recently and I believe its rated limit is 6000lbs. If you needed to tow something heavier on a regular basis I would look at the Suburban in K2500 trim.That 5.7L engine so far appears to be bullet proof. And it should be as it was produced for many years by GMC and was dropped into many of their pick-ups and SUVs.

It took me a week to get used to its size and steering and braking characteristics. I drive on narrow country roads and that requires taking it very easy as its size does not leave much room for a vehicle passing in the opposite direction. High center of gravity, as with any other SUV ,means one has to be prudent in cornering and of course avoid sudden lane changes at high speeds. Crusing on the highway is very painless exercise. The 16" tires with alloy wheels with BFGoodrichs that it came with have held up really well over 25000 miles. I have driven it through
2ft of snow on my drive way and traction with 4WD is very good. It can shift on the fly in wet or dry conditions; and the electronic selectable allows 2LO, 4LO, 4HI or automatic AWD. That mode is very convenient for mixed driving conditions. The 4WD drive system is well thoughtout and the push button controls make it a snap to use. I believe this is a factory option otherwise one gets the shifter on the floor for 4WD operation.

Mine came with heated seats (a relief on cold winter days as you wait for the car to heat up). Leather is holding up well. I really like the front & rear AC (which can make it cold in the truck fast). Radio/CD/Stereo is adequate for my tastes.Favorite feature are the auto-adjusting rear view mirrors....they dim automatically if someone behind you has their high beams or extra bright headlights. And last but not least the compass and external temperature gauge are nice to have. Interior fit and finish is not as good as Japanese or European vehicles. The only minor nit is that the console between the driver and front passenger seat can develop an irritating rattle over bumpy roads.


Overall I give it a resounding thumbs up. I have driven the Toyota Seqouia, Land Cruiser, Ford Expedition. And I would take the YUKON in terms of value for money. The Toyotas are reliable but overpriced and with high re-sales they stay overpriced from my perspective. The 99 Expedition  was too high to climb into comfortably for a family vehicle .
The above is an opinion based on my experience with one 99 YUKON so your mileage may vary.
