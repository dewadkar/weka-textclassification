            I bout my '94 SL1 when I was a young, single gal.  I didn't have a lot of money, but wanted a car that was super reliable and got good gas milage.

I got all that and more with my Saturn.

I didn't want to haggle over a price, because at the time I didn't feel confident that I wouldn't get taken for a sucker.  The folks at the Saturn dealer were very kind and helpful.

That car took me everywhere over the next 7 years.  Numerous road tips, and just your everyday grocery-type trips.

The only problems I had were with the battery and alternator.

I rode to my wedding in my Saturn.  I brought baby #1 and baby #2 home in that car.  There was room for the 2 car seats, but getting another person in the back seat was afully tight.

We were starting to outgrow our Saturn, and talked about selling it.  Just about that time (3 weeks ago) we were in an accident and the car was declared totaled. No one was hurt, which says something for its safety.

I bid a fond farewell to my Saturn.<br><br>
