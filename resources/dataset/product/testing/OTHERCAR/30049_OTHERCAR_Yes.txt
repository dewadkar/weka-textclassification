            I received a free digital camera when I joined up with an internet provider, and was happily taking digital photos with that for months.  I enjoyed the "instant gratification" of digital photos so much, I knew my 35mm days would be over as soon as I could get my hands on a quality digital camera (the camera I got for free only captured in a resolution fit for internet-viewing, not printing).  I did some research and was considering either a Canon or Olympus, but my husband surprised me by getting me the Kodak DC280 Zoom as a gift.  I was initially skeptical since I hadn't researched that particular model, but he said he'd read many reviews and thought I would really like it.  I gave the camera a chance, and he's right.

First of all, it's SIMPLE.  Auto-focus, auto-flash.  Once I figured out how to get the compact flash card (the "film" equivalent for digital photos) in the camera, the rest was easy--I was taking great photos within minutes (not that it's particularly difficult changing the flash cards, but they only go in in one direction, and I turned it every which way before I figured it out. . .).  The batteries are regular AA, and are easy to insert.

After you take a photo, you can see it on the little (1.5" x 1") screen on the back of the camera.  Based on what you see, you can either keep the photo or delete it.  This is such a good feature--when I was using a film camera I would take a few shots of whatever I was trying to capture, and hope that one of them would turn out well.  Now, I take photos with abandon, knowing I can delete all but the best as soon as I'm done shooting.  For example, I was recently on vacation and saw some flamingos, so instead of just taking three photos and hoping for the best, I took a dozen shots of them, then a few minutes later reviewed them on the spot to pick the photo with the best lighting and composition to keep, and deleted the rest.  This is also very useful for "action" shots, where you might have to take quite a few photos to get one where your particular subject is captured well.

Now, I must say that I'm not particularly impressed with the photos I see on that little screen (although they're entirely adequate for weeding out obviously bad photos), so I was still skeptical when I first got the camera that it would produce really good pictures.  But when I got home and downloaded the photos to my computer, I was amazed.  Just for an experiment, I took a photo from my window seat in an airplane.  When I looked at the resulting photo on my computer, I was flabbergasted at the detail it captured!  I could see not only all the houses we were flying over, but also individual cars on the street that I didn't even notice when I was looking down with my own eyes!  And other photos that seemed over-exposed when viewed from the camera's screen were fine once they were viewed full-size on the computer.  Some photos are improved by adjusting the colors and exposure using a photo-enhancing program on the computer, but I honestly have no idea whether any problems are the fault of the camera, or my own lack of photography skill.  Many photos are just fine without any tweaking.

Other features I like are:

Flash control button:  There is a button on top of the camera that toggles between auto-flash, flash off, flash on, and red-eye flash (the camera flashes 2x, to make the subject's pupils contract to reduce red-eye--it works pretty well).  I'll often take photos both with and without flash to see which turns out better, so it's nice to be able to quickly switch between them.  It's also nice to be able to turn the flash off completely for when you're taking photos in one of those "no flash photography allowed" areas.

Zoom:  It's very easy to zoom in and out using a control button on the top of the camera.  If you zoom in more than 2x, the lens stops moving and the photo will zoom in digitally and can only be seen on the camera's screen.  It's hard to see if it's sunny outside, so I generally stick to just the 2x optical zoom unless I'm indoors.  But it's nevertheless easy to use--just keep pressing the zoom button until you get the composition you want.

There are other features available through the menu, but I don't use them very often, although I did try taking black & white and sepia-toned photos (the B&W actually turned out quite nicely).

In my opinion, the camera does have a few drawbacks.  I like to carry a camera around with me pretty frequently so I can take photos of things I see in my everyday life, and this camera is much heavier and bigger than my little freebie digital camera.  I'm willing to deal with the extra weight for the vastly improved photo quality, but it's just not ideal.  After a few weeks of using the camera I also thought it prudent to invest in another set of rechargeable batteries, and a higher capacity compact flash card, and a camera case to hold everything.  I've found that having one set of batteries in the camera, and another charged up and ready to go is the best way to make sure you don't run out of batteries during an important occasion (although carrying the extra batteries adds even more weight. . .) Of course you could just buy new batteries at any convenience store if you need to since they're standard AA.  And unless you are taking photos exclusively for email and the internet, you'll probably want to get another flash card, too, for times when you'll be away from your computer for a while (like on vacation) and will want to store more than a dozen photos in the camera.  This is not really even a drawback since it's easily remedied by just buying a card large enough for your needs.  The one I got was relatively expensive, but once I considered that I would easily spend that much developing several rolls of film, it made the cost seem more reasonable, since the flash card is reuseable.  Oh, I almost forgot--downloading goes pretty slowly using the serial port, so use this with a computer with a USB port unless you have a lot of patience.

Overall, I'm very happy with this camera, and the drawbacks are minor compared to the advantages.  I can't comment on its suitability for the very serious photographer, but for someone who just wants very nice snapshots, it's really great!
