            When I was looking for a new car, I didn't have the Cabrio in mind. I hadn't even looked at one. When I was at the Volkswagen dealership, that changed. When I first saw it, I thought that's a cute little car. The next day I went back and got it. The price is nice and I got a lot more features on it than the two cars I previously owned. 

The stereo is pretty nice but not all come with a CD player. The buttons are included and you can have the CD player installed if you like. One of my favorite things is the cassette holder. The tape doesn't stick out when it's not playing. It's easy to switch from tape to radio to CD. 

I love the how all the windows are automatic. If something is in the way, the window immediately goes back down as a safety pre-caution. Putting the top down is a breeze as well. The trunk is a little small but still big enough to put your groceries or bags in. 

Even though it's a small car, there is plenty of room. It may not look like it has a back seat but there's room for someone to sit. The heater and the A/C work great as well. 

The Cabrio is the best car I've had. It's fun and sporty. There's many features that you wouldn't expect that is included. This would be a good car for teenagers or people who just want a fun little car.
