            I've leased a 1997. Company vehicle so there is a lot of driving. 
Purchased in Oct 97, The beginning was great. The Whistler Edition, Top of the line. 
By March 98 the air conditioning started to work overtime and the brakes were getting soft. April 98 Full change of brakes, they had had put &quot;general brakes&quot; on in stead of the super tough brakes needed on an SUV. So they changed them.
August 98, Hottest spell in  British Columbia history, 43ï¿½C, NO AIR CONDITIONING the compressor had broken and they had to order one. 3 weeks before it came in. 
September 98 needed brakes again full set
In October 98 I had to make an emergency stop because of a pedestrian crossing the street, both feet standing on the brakes, dry pavement and no stopping I now have to replace the front bumper before the lease is up.
March 99, needs new brakes. Replaced them.
Last visit to the Dealer, rear brakes need to be replaced again, I only have 54000 on the vehicle.
For a &quot;Luxury Vehicle&quot; @ $600 per month this is unacceptable.
As for the comments about the plastic around the doors, mine too, all of the map holders at bottom of the doors are either cracked or broken completely. I don't recall ever using them!
There are plenty of pros to the vehicle. 
Lots of excelleration, Gas mileage is ok.
Comfortable, Lots of space in the back, Looks good, Handles excellent in the snow.
Just doesn't like keeping brakes.<br><br>
