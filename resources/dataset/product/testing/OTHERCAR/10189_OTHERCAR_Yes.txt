                 Buying a car on a budget is often a crisis.  This Lexus SUV is the perfect solution.  The price often ranges from 28 to 32 thousand dollars.  I must say that for the package you get, you will be happy.  The real turn on is its sleek styling on the outside.  People seem to think that because a car looks nice on the outside that it will be disgusting on the inside.  Lexus has ended this thought.  The controls on the dashboard are well placed and easily accessable.  You will also find that Lexus has given it a sports car look on the inside.  You may feel like you are in a BMW five series instead of a suv.  
     Jeep should consider this car a threat to their grand cherokee models.  This is the first real competition that they have had in a long time.  The only problem few will find is that a Lexus does not ride as well off road as a Jeep.  But, if you are in the market for one of these, I doubt you really want to go off road.  The seats are very comfortable.  the head rests are not the best I have rested up against, but they are definitely not the worst.  We can give that award to Kia.  Handling is swift and statistics say it is reliable, so if you feel like this is a car for you, do not hesitate.<br><br>
