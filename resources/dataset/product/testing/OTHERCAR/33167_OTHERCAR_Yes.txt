            As Chrysler advertises - I'm not sure what it is - although my local car wash charges me the extra "suv" fee.  I previously owned both mini vans and mid-sized suvs.  The lines of the vehicle are much more attractive than the mini van, and the ride feel and comfort is far more superior than the suvs.  The ergonomics for the driver are fantastic, although the dash suffers from an excessive amount of plastic down the center console.  The Pacifica is fantastic for four adults, although there clearly is not as much luggage space as mini vans. Seating position and support are outstanding.  Seats four adults extremely well.  Although I would have never ordered this option, I'm surprised by how much I like the the remote rear hatch.  Of all the all-wheel drive six passenger vehicles I test drove, the Pacifica has the lowest center of gravity (i.e., very safe feel) and smooth ride. Although reviews indicated this car was underpowered, I have experienced good power in the Allegheny mountains - which I drive regularly. Buy Chrysler's aftermarket rear bumper protector - it is easy to install and proves to be very functional in protecting the rear bumper. Visibility is difficult when backing up.  Rear doors hold an unusual amount of water when opened after a rain.  Gas mileage is only 18 mpg (as advertised - but you would expect better from a V-6) I ordered chrome door seals from the Chrysler aftermarket brochure - they look great - but the "glue" provided by Chrysler was inadequate.  I had to use super-glue - which worked great. Bottom line - I'm very happy with this choice - I now have 8,000 miles on my Pacifica.
