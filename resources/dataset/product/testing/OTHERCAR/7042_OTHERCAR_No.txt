            My wife and I selected this model after doing quite a bit of reading reviews at a variety of sites, and comparing prices/features.  This was rated well, and other things that tipped the hand in Sony's favor was the metal casing (knew with our daughter it was going to hit the floor a few times), our success with our Sony TRV-730 Handicam, and because of the Handicam we already had a supply of SmartCard media.

Overall the camera is easy enough to use and learn and has nice controls.  The pros have been documented by many others so I won't bother going into them deeply because you've likely read them already.

The cons, however, are where I seem to have a more unique perspective from the other reviews.  Ultimately we wouldn't have bought this camera knowing what we know now.  We bought this primarily for family photography, something that it has performed miserably at.  The slightest motion from either the subject or the photographer renders the picture blurry and useless.  This is a conclusion I've come to after very thoroughly testing out every setting the camera has, both automatic and manual, under a wide range of illumination and motion conditions.  Conclusion - unless you are taking a picture of a basket of fruit with a tripod and heavy lighting, expect the photo to be fuzzy.  Not exactly what we were expecting or needing to take pictures of our little toddler.

The shutter lag (time from when you click the button to take a picture and when the picture is actually taken) seems excessive (can easily be 4sec or more - plenty of time for that toddler to stop that cute thing she was doing and be in a different room).  This can be helped if you do a half-press on the shutter and wait for the green light before clicking all the way (this just sifts some of the lag to picture prep, as you're still waiting for it to focus lock).

I've spent several hours on the phone with Sony tech support, to no avail.  Nothing more than a "Hmm, well, sounds like your camera functions within factory parameters so there's nothing we can do."

Summary:  This is a very expensive Sony Paperweight.
