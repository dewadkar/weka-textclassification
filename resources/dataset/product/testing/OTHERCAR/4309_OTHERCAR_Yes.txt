            When asked why we bought the beetle, I like many people mention how safe the car is. We were impressed by how well the car did in the independent safety tests. But I think this hides the strong emotional appeal the car has. In fact, VW did so many things right, that the emotional appeal might cloud your vision a little. So its good to also be aware of a few concerns.

All of the good things are true about the car. There are many details that just make you smile when you're in the car. People love getting their first ride in it. The first time you are in it at night and flip on the lights is pure joy. But here are my warnings so that you can make a more informed decision...
-- Visibility is great looking forward once you get used to the HUGE dash and not seeing any of the hood. There are 2 blindspots that take some getting used to... where you would normally look when making a left turn is blocked by the larger than normal front post. When backing up and changing lanes, there are also large blind spots. 
-- The engine is packed into the hood and I have heard that some repairs require VW to remove the fender to gain access to some parts. Once the warranty wears out, this could be expensive. I read this on the http:www.newbug.org web site.
-- I had the electric fuel regulator go on me after just one month. I brought it in for service. They didn't fix it properly the first time so I had to bring it in again where it sat for almost a week while waited for the part that was back ordered. I heard that Consumer Reports may have reported on there being a lack of replacement parts. VW Customer Service did not exactly handle this whole situation well (no offer for a rental car while they waited for the part among other things) but this may only be a factor of my dealer. 

It definitely affected our feelings about the company as the car was only a month old which is why I felt the need to post my thoughts on the less than perfect parts of the car. In the end, its still a fun drive.<br><br>
