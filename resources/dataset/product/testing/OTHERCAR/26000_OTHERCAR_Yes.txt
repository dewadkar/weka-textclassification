            I bought my Cavalier in December of 2000, while a Senior in college and working part-time.  I need to buy quickly and to find something that was affordable.  My dad's a fix-it type with knowledge of American cars, so I was discouraged from buying foreign cars (the Hyundai was cheaper).

Anyway, I test drove the car and was still thinking that the Dodge Avenger was a little roomier, and a little nicer looking.  The price on this car was much better, though and it included a CD player, which the Avenger didn't.  In addition, I would be able to afford the sport package which offered additional cup holders, and a sporty addition to the rear of the car that sort of balanced out the otherwise too rounded shape.  The color I chose was a very pretty metallic aqua.

A year into driving it, I must report I'm very pleased.  I've driven through snow with no problem, as well as rain.  The interior still looks beautiful as well as the exterior.

The car fits me very well.  I'm only 5'3" and I find seatbelts usually lie uncomfortably - not so on my Cavaliere!  I have plenty of leg room.  My 6'3" boyfriend can move the seat a comfortable distance for his legs, as well.  The trunk comfortably fits my gym bag, roller blades, books, groceries, etc.  The back seat is wonderful!  It folds down and allows larger items like suitcases the full expanse of trunk through back seat.

I was in an accident on a major highway where road debris was hurled from under another car and slid under mine.  It resulted in $1,500 worth of damage with seemingly little impact.  I'm not mechanical enough to determine whether this was the Cavaliere's fault or mine for not choosing a less expensive mechanic.  Anyway, it bent my rim, bubbled my tire, caused body damage to my bumper and punctured my windshield washer fluid holder.  Could be unscrupulous mechanic or could be less than stellar body on the car.

All in all, aside from oil changes and the aforementioned accident, I've spent little on this car in the past year.  It's reliable, comfortable and inexpensive.

I recommend it to people on a budget and particularly young people just starting out who need nice looking, affordable transportation.
