            Not everyone needs a 4x4 pickup but if you do that is why i am writing this revew.  This is my cousins 1998 Chevy extended cab short box that i am refering to.  It is forest green and has a rock crushing 230 horsepower Vortec 305.  For starters it has lots of power.  I have driven it and in the right conditions, with his old tires, you could bake the tires at any stoplight.  Him and I have tested some of the same trucks with the Vortec 350 and have concluded that the 305 has almost as much snap as the 350.  The only difference is the 350 has more snap off the line because it has more low end torque.  It will fly, doing 0-60 in 8.8 seconds.  Now you might be thinking 8.8 seconds, that is slow.  Keep in mind that we are talking about a full sized truck with a small V8.  I have ridden in it going 95 and it feels solid.  As far as comfort, it rides like very well (for a truck anyway).  It is enjoyable to take long road trips in it.  It dose not ride as nice as a park Avenue, but you would be disappointed if you put 1 ton of sand in the back of a Buick.  As far as problems and reliability, he has had very little or no problems with it and it is just north of 100,000 miles the only major problem is he had someone contaminate his break fluid so he had to replace the master cylinder and the rear break calipers.  The only other problem is those 100,000 mile spark plug wires broke when he took them off when he did a tune-up.  It is an excellent rig and I would suggest getting one.  Thanks for reading.
