                 I usually buy new small pick up trucks.  However, with the addition of 2 grandaughters, neither my little truck nor my husband's 1-ton is large enough to haul 2 kids around so this time I decided to look for something with a little more seat room.  I was still undecided whether to buy new or used so I started doing a little searching and got exactly what I wanted for a lot less than I'd planned to spend. 
     The Jimmy I bought is a 1998 SLE.  The color is green (which matches my husband's GMC 1-ton pickup), it is automatic with a V-6 engine.  I absolutely love this vehicle!  The automatically adjustable seats are a dream.  They are so, so comfortable and adjust to a number of positions in seconds.  The push-button 4wd is located conveniently at the top of the dash, just above the radio, so I never forget to take it out of 4wd.  When I first got it I was a bit concerned that the roomy interior may take awhile to heat up (NH has some cold winters!), but my fears were gone when I found that in less than 4 minutes, the interior was nice and toasty.  

     My Jimmy has AC but I can't comment on it at this point because with the sub-zero temps we've been experiencing....I haven't needed it!  

     The sound system is excellent with a control that adjusts the sound to account for open windows and road noise.  The alloy wheels look very sharp and the tinted glass all around helps with the bright glare from sun on new-fallen snow.  This is the only vehicle I've ever owned that has keyless entry.  I like this feature because even with a load of stuff in my arms, I don't have to fumble around for the key to lock/unlock the doors. The windshield wipers have multiple intermittent settings and the rear windshield wiper/defroster works great.   
    
     The back section is roomy and if you need more storage, the back seats fold down independently to add space.  There is also a tarp-type thing that pulls out of the side and slides over the back section to hide valuables. There are also many little storage areas in the vehicle.  There is a good sized one between the front seats, pockets on the bottom of each door, storage pouches on the back of each front seat, overhead CD storage, an overhead cubby for the garage door opener, a large glove compartment and a nice little storage compartment in the back for the jack, prybar, etc. 

     I love to drive this vehicle!  It is the first vehicle I've owned with that independent front suspension that my husband raves about so much.  He's right.  It makes for a smooth comfortable ride and the vehicle handles like a dream.  I've driven through a couple of snow storms with it already and I was completely confident even in 2wd.  This holds the road much better than any of those little trucks I've owned.  

     The exterior is gorgeous.  The deep forest green color is very pleasing and the chrome trim pieces really accent the details in the styling.  

     The only problem I've found with this Jimmy is that the back corner pieces block my view a bit when I'm trying to back up.  However, after driving trucks with such clear back views for 20  years, I guess it may just be that I need to get used to using my mirrors more.  

     I bought this Jimmy second-hand with 55 thousand miles on it.  It was a private sale from a guy who took meticulous care of it and transferred the bumper-to-bumper warranty to me.  I have full warranty on this vehicle for another 20 thousand miles.  He gave me a folder with complete records of everything from the sale to oil changes.  He paid over 26,000 almost 5 yrs ago and sold it to me for 10,000.  I feel that I got a great deal.
