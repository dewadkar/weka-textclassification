            The Jeep is a nice ride, and the V8 has lots of power,
There are some problems that you should be aware of. (My Jeep is at 110,000 miles right now)
I have had to replace the radiator, the original was is plastic and not fixable! It was the same price to put in another metal one as it was to buy a new plastic one.
Lots of wind noise through closed windows.
The electrics keep on having minor problems..lights in the radio fail, door locks don't work. A new automatic door remote costs $95 so when the battery dies, ( about 50 to 70K miles) open it with a knife and replace the battery yourself.
The seats start to sag at about 70K, and the headrests loose their fittings. Apart from regular $700 repairs at about each second service, the car still runs well, just costs much to much.
