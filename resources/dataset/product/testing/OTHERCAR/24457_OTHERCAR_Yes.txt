            This is my first purchase of a digital camera. I was set on buying a Olympus digital camera, until I tested S50. After doing my research I was sure that I was going to purchase a Olympus, but after dealing with some salespeople that had no knowledge of digital cameras, I bought the S50 with out doing any research. Smart? This is the best purchase I have made in a long time. After seeing the movie mode and the 6X zoom, I made my decision. I looked at the S30 and the S70, but the S30 did not have as good quality picture and the S70 did not have the rotating LCD screen, which is why I choose the S50 over the S70. The price of the S70 was too much for me.
I've only had the S50 for two weeks. This camera has much more than I need. 
I haven't used the Sharpness/Exposure/flash Level/or the White Balance setting yet. Once I understand these features the pictures should be even better.The movie mode is outstanding, a little slow on playback but this is the best speed at this time.
The memory stick incredible. Now I have a Sony laptop,which has the memory stick port. Downloading is simple with the memory stick. I can't give any information on downloading the memory stick and other computers, but having a Sony notebook and the S50 makes downloading simple and fast, very fast.The ease of recharging the battery is a plus.
Also, the ease of connecting to a T.V. is simple.
The S50 is small easy to use and is perfect from the expert or someone like me , who is just playing around with a new toy.
There are only three things that I don't like about the S50:no light or flash during movie mode(you should buy a camcorder if you want a light) The memory stick that is provided with the camera sucks(you have to buy a 16 or 32 memory stick and finally the price, for $600 there should be a 16 or 32mb stick and there should be bag that comes with the camera.
If you own a Sony notebook and are looking for a digital camera you must buy the DSC-30 50 or 70. The S50 is easy to use simple to e-mail photos and movie clips. The rotating LCD screen made me choose the S50 over the S70. If you want better then great picture quality go with the S70.
