            I'm writing this reviewed based on having driven the vehicle only once, ridden in the front and third row twice, and relative to my '99 RX300. 

I'm not sure what to make of the 2004 Highlander. Is it a 'bad' minivan, a better than average handling SUV, or a cheap RX330? The model I drove was the Highlander (not Limited) with AWD and V-6. A colleague recently purchased this vehicle up in Syracuse, NY to replace an existing car. He purchased the vehicle for approximately $800 above INVOICE, which is almost $4000 below sticker. He bought the Highlander with the tow and appearance package. This included fog lights, alloy wheels, upgraded engine/transmission cooler, etc. It basically has everything except the sunroof and upgraded interior (leather, wood grain, etc.) 

With the Highlander, you're getting the exact mechanical twin of the 2004 Lexus RX330. Unlike the Acura MDX/Honda Pilot 'twins', you don't get a tuned down engine like on the Pilot. The engine here is the same 3.3-liter, 230 hp V-6 matched with a five speed automatic transmission with 242 lbs. of torque. This bests my '99 Lexus by ten horses and 20 lbs. and from the first drive you can feel the extra horses and torque. The increase wasn't substantial, but enough to be noticed if you drive both cars. The additional torque does help it to go from a dead stop with more force. I believe the acceleration is about high 7, or low 8 seconds from 0-60 mph. The handling was precise and steady, almost sedan like. The four-wheel independent suspension definitely helps with the ride and quietness. The vehicle, although not a Lexus in quality, was surprisingly quiet and fun to drive. 

The interior, although advertised as a 7-passenger vehicle, is really fit for five medium sized adults, and two children (below the age of ten). The third row in this vehicle is totally useless for adults. I am only 5'10" and I barely fit into the third row. I could not sit with my legs straight because I would be too upright to fit sitting straight. I had to sit slouched and my legs so far apart that another person my size could not fit back there with me. The third row at best is for your dog, little children, or your in-laws. If you're considering this as a replacement for a 7-passenger minivan, forget about it! 

The exterior of the vehicle was silver with a grey interior. The seats were cloth covered, with grey accents and polished silver trim on the dash. This was not the limited, so there was no wood trim and the climate control buttons were separated from the radio bezel and controlled by three knobs. What at first looked like a typical Toyota interior, upon further inspection, resulted in a slight disappointment with quality. The dash and panels, which typically are a soft to the touch plastic/rubber material, was now a hard plastic and felt cheap. The fit and finish however was very good, with screw holes well covered and out of eyesight. The vehicle is for 'seven' but surprisingly there are ten cup holders. Two up front on the bottom center console, two on each rear door (that's right, cup holders on the door), two more on the second row pull down center arm rest (if no one is sitting there, which is actually then one passenger less), and one on each side of the third row wheel arch. So, ten holders for four adults and two dogs. Overkill, I think. 

The radio was an integrated CD/FM/Cassette radio, with probably six speakers minimum. I don't know the exact specs. for the radio, but it sounded just as good, if not better, than the one in my Lexus. The ergonomics on this vehicle are very good. Everything is well within reach and placed where you would normally expect those controls to be. As mentioned earlier, the AC controls are on the center dash, with three dials located above the radio. The transmission shifter is on the middle console, not steering column mounted. There is an airbag on/off button for the passenger seat, but it's not a button to turn the airbag on or off, just a display. My colleague didn't know what is actually meant, but we believe that if there is no passenger seated in the seat, the airbag is deactivated, but we're not sure, read your owner's manual if you buy the Highlander. 

The exterior of the vehicle looks like it's smaller than the Lexus RX, but we've seen one parked side by side, and they're comparable in size. With the spoiler and fog lights, the vehicle looks fairly aggressive. I know that this vehicle isn't going to wow or catch anyone's eyes, but you know which flavor ice cream is the best seller every year in America? Vanilla. Plain Jane vanilla, and this car doesn't get any more vanilla. It won't inspire brisk drives down the autobahn, or crazy off-roading,  but it won't offend either. 

Comparably equipped with leather and sunroof, this car could run you about $33000, but a Lexus would run you $43,000 so this could be your cheap Lexus. It could be a bad minivan replacement, or it could be a competent SUV on snow and rain. Mentioning snow, this vehicle was purchased up in Syracuse, so it came with Toyo tires, rather than Goodyear Integrity (see my review on the Intergrity). The Toyo looked a lot more aggressive in tread and would probably handle better than the Goodyear's. I believe that Toyota does vary tires supplied based on region. I'm sure Highlanders sold in Florida or southern California would not come with Michelins. 

With all this said, the vehicle is a nice vehicle. Well packaged with plenty of punch and fun to drive points. I think it loses some points for interior quality and feel, but they're not horrific. I would recommend this vehicle because based on my Lexus' record; this car should handle itself very well and drive smoothly for a very long time. Just don't think it'll replace your Sienna or Odyssey, it won't.
