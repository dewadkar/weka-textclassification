            I bought my red '96 Eclipse RS in Jan of '96 and just traded it three days ago (Dec of '02) for a Mazda 6--I'm 26 now so it was time for a more "mature" car. Throughout those 7 years, and only 54,000 miles, I never had one problem with the Eclipse. However, I took exceptional care of my baby (i.e., oil changed every 3,000 or 3 months, all factory recommended maintenance was scrupulously observed, washed and waxed religiously). I did have to have the brake pads replaced every 15k miles or so and even with regular maintenance the transmission started jerking at 50k miles. 

The Eclipse has a good base 2.0L 140hp 4 cylinder engine which, even with an automatic, was quick off the line. The engine was absolutely flawless. The car's ergonomics are also outstanding. I loved the way the center console area is angled towards the driver. I also really liked the way you sit in the car. You feel fairly close to the road and the way the seat and steering wheel are positioned I was able to drive the car with my knees. After so many years it almost drove itself. 

All of that said, I would still never buy another Mitsubishi b/c the intangibles of the car are sorry. There is a tremendous amount of road noise in the car--even at low speeds and it doesn't feel very "tight." The suspension on the car was not very good and consequently the car had a lot of body roll when cornered hard. The so-called "bucket" seats were also pretty pathetic. They felt more comparable to a Buick. As the car aged, the power assist steering got very nervous and light at high speeds so I was always nervous driving it on the interstate as it felt so loose. 

Also, I was not a big fan of how skimpy Mitsu is with their options and standard features. I had manual locks and windows (huge pain in the neck btw), cloth seats, no moonroof, and the sticker on the car was $17,500. And that included their so-called sports package of a spoiler and 14" alloy wheels. 

Still, I loved my Eclipse very much. It never failed me and when it was brand new I did 105 mph from Naples to Fort Lauderdale (or the entire distance across the peninsula of Florida) and it felt like I was going 50. She aged rather quickly though even with regular maintenance. For that reason I would never recommend you buy it used. I think the main reason she was so faithful to me was because I babied her so much. If you love a car and give it the attention it needs, it will love you back.
