            What impressed me most when I went to buy my Nissan was its quiet, smooth ride.  Mine was not an automatic but a 5 speed, standard transmission.  When I drove it on the highway, the shift was smooth, no jerking and the pick up was very fast for a standard.  I left some pricier cars in the dust.

I was astounded and pleased to see that my car also had cruise control, which I thought was not an option with stick shift. The cruise control has worked very well and was especially helpful on long trips on the interstates.

The mileage was excellent, especially on the interstates.  I found a tank of gas would take me about 370 miles on the highway.

The speakers which came with the car were excellent and provided great bass and treble sounds.  The music could be heard well throughout the car.

The bucket seats give excellent back and leg support.  The seats come up underneath the leg and gives it proper support.  This is important if you are driving any distance at all.  Legs can get fatigued and the Sentra prevents most of that.

As long as the car was serviced regularly, there were no problems for a few years.  Lately however, there has been a creeping electrical problem which manifests itself in the dashboard lights cutting out once and a while.  This is a problem that occurs in Nissan Sentras of a certain age.  My previous car was a Sentra, and, when it reached the age of seven years, electrical problems began to plague it also.  

Overall though, the Nissan Sentra has been a marvelous ride and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
