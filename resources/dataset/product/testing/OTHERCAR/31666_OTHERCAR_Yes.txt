            I have been driving Chevy vans for years. (Other makes also). We now use Chevy vans(G30) exclusively for my business because of the reliability and availability of replacement parts.  One example is my 1995 Chevy G30 van. It now has over 100,000 miles and is still going strong. My trucks are worked very hard (they have clutch drive systems attached and run at 2500 rpm all day long, so the 100,000 miles are about half of the actual use on the 350 motor). Only minor repairs have been needed on this van. (Brakes, starter, alternator, etc, mostly caused by the daily abuse this van endures) 
The 350 motor supplies plenty of power. My van carries a couple thousand pounds every day and has never had a problem with steep hills or a lack of needed power in any situation. 
The only drawback I can think of : the door hinges need to be replaced after 4-5 years. I highly recommend Chevy vans!
