            The Nissan Maxima (Max) is a great all around quality sports sedan.  If you're looking for good looks, comfort, power, ergonomics and functionality (i'm probably forgetting one or two categories), then get a Maxima.

I bought my '03 Maxima in December of '02, and now have almost 23K on it and haven't had one problem, squeak, rattle, etc.  It does everything well.  I didn't buy the Max to throw it into high speed corners and auto cross it.  The Max handles and brakes just great.  I have the SE model w/ the 17 inch wheels/50 series tires and 4 wheel disc brakes, and as long as you are not street racing or driving like you think the Max is a race car, this car handles and brakes nicely.   

I like how other reviews get carried away with their version or expectations of what 'sports sedan' means (bear in mind the price/value of the Max, it is not a 50K-100K luxury sedan that may rise to all expectations)...the 'sports' basically means a basic sedan is taken and fixed up with a little bigger tires, maybe 4 wheel disc brakes, better engine, a little better suspension, etc.  It's still a basic car.  Yes, the Max is a sports sedan and it does all of your running around and travels in excellent form. 

Yes, there is torque steer which is inherent in all front wheel drive cars but this engine is considerably more powerful than the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry engines.  Torque steer isn't a problem unless you accelerate with no hands on the steering wheel, so if you are going to punch the throttle, hold on and get ready to keep it from getting out of control on you. 

This is a brand new Nissan Max which means quality from the get go.  As I mentioned above, I haven't had one problem.  I have even stopped on occasion to check my tire pressure at the local service station and even the tires didn't need any pressure adjustment as you might expect it to after several months.  My Max is basically flawless/problem free (knock on 'wood') at this point.  I love this car.

Now granted I don't have kids to transport, nor do i travel in the car a lot for work where i would need various storage compartments that some folks would like.  This is a basic sedan that does everything well, not a recreational vehicle or minivan.

Ok, i will say it's turning radius is horrendous,,,in order to turn around,,,at minimum, it requires a three point turn,,,be careful, at some intersections if you are thinking of trying to do a U turn (it may not make it), but i had read about this particular problem before i bought it and accepted that short coming.   Also, i wish Nissan would have illuminated the steering wheel control buttons for night driving (like the cruise control and stereo volume controls) but i can live with it.
