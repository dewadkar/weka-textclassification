            Well I've been driving my '92 Toyota Camry for almost 3 years now and besides a flat tire here and there thankfully there have been no serious problems with my ride.  In fact my mom who drives a '98 Toyota Corolla and dad who drives an '89 Toyota Previa are able to say their cars are for the most part trouble free.  
Besides its durability it is extremely roomy evidenced by me traveling with 8 people in the car at once one night.  Dunum knows how roomy it was since he was passed out in my back- seat on New Year's Eve.  The trunk space is large which is nice for making those keg runs on certain nights.  The car also drives good in all weather conditions and provides such a smooth ride.  
My favorite feature is the automatic headlight cutoff when you open a door when the keys are out of the ignition, which means you can never leave your lights on and come back to a dead battery.  All in all it is a great car and I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
