            I have had 2 other brand digital cameras and this is the only one that worked for over a month. I am an online auction seller and take a number of pictures nearly every day. I have had this camera for nearly a year and it still works like a charm!

First of all, after loading the batteries and memory card you simply push the spring loaded power switch and the camera is almost instantly ready to take a photo. You may then turn the dial on the right hand side of the camera to the play icon to review the photos that you have taken or to the trashcan icon to delete any unwanted photos.

Secondly, after installing and configuring the software you may download the photos to your computer by simply attaching the serial cable to the computer and camera and switching the turn dial to the computer icon and clicking a few buttons on your computer. This process is however very slow.. It takes around 5-20 minuets to download the pictures to the computer depending on picture quality and amount.

The camera takes excellent close up macro photos when configured properly. In this mode you may get the camera as close as 3 inches from the subject to take a photo. You may find that when in the macro mode the camera will display a camera shaking notice, you must set the camera to forced flash in order to get rid of this message and take focused and properly rendered close-up photos. 

The bundled software is not exactly one of the cameras better features. It has an old not very user friendly interface. I would personally recommend that you use Adobe Photo deluxe or a similar software package to edit your pictures.

Finally, the Fuji MX-1200 is a great deal for the money. It is excellent to put in a purse or pocket for quick snapshots on the fly. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone as a first time camera or for a teenager.
