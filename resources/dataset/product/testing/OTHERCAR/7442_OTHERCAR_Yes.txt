            To me, grand am used to be the name of a normal run of the mill car.  Well today grand am has grown up, providing a sporty engine and looks and providing comfort that we all desire. 

The low down on this car, Affordable, Great Value, Fun

There are several items i would like to point out about the Grand AM GT, first the engine consists of a sporty 3.4 Ram Air V6, This gives the GT 175@5200rpms horsepower and 205ft/lbs@4000rpms torque. Since this car weighs ~3000lbs, this propels it along like a rocket. Another interesting feature is the option to get the &quot;bright chrome cast aluminum&quot; wheels, these wheels look like chrome wheels, but many are suprised when they tap it.  Its actually a bonded chrome on an aluminum wheel!  This is a great idea, because a) its lighter than chrome rims b) cheaper than chrome rims c) just as easy to keep clean as chrome rims.  I have only 2 complaints about this car
1) The ride is a little rough, this is because of the GT specific   suspension, but in general is very acceptable 
2) Blind spots, This car seems to have a large blind spot, thus more dangerous

Another great feature is that insurance is much cheaper than its competors, IE: Mustang, Celica, Eclipse, Firebird, etc, thus this car is perfect for teenagers

I have provided some Specs on the Grand Am GT, and GT1
