            I bought this vehicle a year ago with 156000 miles on it. Although, I cannot say that the money that I have spent on it wasn't hard to part with,  my 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee is like my best friend.  It goes everywhere with me.  It is my road buddy.  It is comfortable for up to five riders.  I know the driver's seat alone is quiet comfortable.  I am usually the one to haul all my buddies around in it.  

We had a really tough time with the transmission.  For those with this vehicle, the model year had two different types of transmissions.  This can be quite a serious problem.  If the wrong transmission parts are put in to fix it, serious transmission problems will occur.  Once, our transmission mechanic learned of the fact that there were two different transmissions this model year, it was simple to fix once this little detail was worked out.  

I also like the way my Grand Cherokee handles.  It turns sharp and fits in tight spaces.  It is easy to park and maneuver out of small spaces despite its size.  It is quite impressive to be an SUV.

I have to admit that it was well worth every penny I paid for it.  It now has 183000 miles on it and it is still going strong.  I am sold on the Jeep company, and will own a new one when I graduate from college.  The Jeep company makes one heck of a vehicle that is built tough and built to last.
