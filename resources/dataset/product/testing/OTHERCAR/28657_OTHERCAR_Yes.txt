            I got the Kodak DC200 Plus when it was on sale for PhP15500 or about US$ 325 . 
I was eager to take photos of my kids and YES ! it did the job quite well. It was good for regular home activity pictures, even at night time parties and picture quality was really good. The kids loved seeing their photos in the camera display right after the shot was taken.
Photo quality can set into 3 settings, taking up more of the memory cards capacity with each higher setting. At the lowest setting you can store about 50 pictures, middle 30 pictures and highest about 15 pictures. 
As soon as the memory card is full with good pictures (you can delete bad pictures as you take them)be sure to load them onto your computer first chance you get and bring a book while doing so....file transfer does take some time.
but once in , you can organize these pictures and crop them with kodaks picture easy software. More serious enhancements are not available however and you'd have to use other software for that.
And believe me, your kids will have a million things to do with their pictures on your computer so allocate some of your budget for your color printers ink cartridges!
I found that you can take good pictures up to about 8 feet from the subject...go farther away and the faces of the subjects get really small..since this model doesnt have zoom. 


When i got the camera, the dealer wisely advised for me to use rechargeable batteries, which i bought with a charger.
And the camera worked fine , so long as you remember to recharge your batteries and a spare set ( so 8 AA batteries in all) before going out to use your camera on a trip or to a wedding..etc.

Then after a year of good use... the camera refused to take on the rechargeable batteries, wanting only the expensive energizers....grrr...so i sold the camera.

now, my kids are asking me to get another one.
I miss the kodak.
