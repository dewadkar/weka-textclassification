            This camera is a very nice camera. High Resolution Pictures and great snapping speed.  But the one thing I dislike about it is the size!!! This camera is way too big for its time.  In the 21'st century we can do a lot better than this.  We have cameras that are no bigger than my palm.  This thing is huge.  Well even though this is so huge it is a overall great camera that people should own if they need a simple camera and dont want it to be small.  This camera does deserve to live and I think it is okay to have a camera that is big in size but so great in taking pictures.<br><br>
