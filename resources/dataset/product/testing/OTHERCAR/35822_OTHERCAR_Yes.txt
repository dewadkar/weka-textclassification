            I actually didn't buy my car.  Originally my Kentucky grandmother's, it sat in her driveway virtually unused for 2 years after her stroke in 1997. My grandmother died last August, and, knowing I was going to be getting my driver's license soon, willed it to me.   I got my driver's license last October and since then, (except for the month of November--more on that later)my little Saturn and I've been inseparable.  It's a 1993 white two door manual transmission SL2 coupe--except for the addition of a cd player, it's pretty bare bones.  I live in Northern California, and with gas prices of at least $1.75 for REGULAR a gallon, I greatly appreciate &quot;Trixie&quot;'s superior gas mileage.  I got in an accident last November, and the shop where I took it said that in many other cars the damage would have been much worse.  Being so small, the turning radius is excellent (perfect considering my affinity to curbs) and I haven't had any major problems from the engine.  California has stricter smog regulations than Kentucky, but &quot;Trixie&quot; passed the CA smog test with flying colors.  As much as I love my car, there are some problems: The interior is miniscule; my 6+ feet tall friends refuse to ride in it because of the lack of head and leg room.  I've never been in the backseat, but I hear it's VERY uncomfortable.  The configuration of the knobs and buttons isn't always easy to find, and the shoulder seat belt practically chokes you at times.  All in all though, I'm very happy with my car.  For a first car, it serves all purposes; good gas mileage, easy to drive (it's the easiest stick I've ever driven) and cute sporty look.  I would recommend this car to the younger crowd-and only someone who usually drove alone (for the size reasons.  Families with kids should shy away--at least from the two door version.  Thank you!<br><br>
