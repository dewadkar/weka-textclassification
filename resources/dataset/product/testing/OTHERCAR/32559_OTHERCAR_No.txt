            My first Saturn (SL2-fully loaded) was leased, new, in 1996.  24 hours after I drove it off the showroom floor, it had to be towed back because it wouldn't start.  After having a rental car for a few days, I finally got my new car back.  It started, but it was rough.  There were barely 100 miles on the odometer at this point.  I originally had decided on the Saturn because of the advertising that boasts quality, reliability, and safety.  Plus, it was affordable and I had just graduated from college.

Within the first 30 days of ownership, the car died (again) for no reason, twice.  Both times, I was stranded miles from home and not always on the best sides of town.  All three times, Saturn had a different explanation for what they felt went wrong and &quot;fixed&quot; it.  The last straw was when the glove box door broke and wouldn't close properly and I went back to them about that 30 day money back guarantee they used to get me to lease the car in the first place. I feel they took advantage of my lack of knowledge concerning thier guarantee (I'm female, and was 26 at the time), and Saturn quickly replaced my vehicle with one that was similar.  I didn't know I could have gotten my deposit and downpayment money back and walked away, they forgot to mention that option.  I also had to sign a waiver saying that I had received a replacement and I was not entitled to another one in the future, regardless of the reasons.  

Needless to say, I had numerous issues with the replacement Saturn as well.  It was also brand new, but the problems kept coming and they could never seem to fix it for good.  Sometimes it wouldn't even start in the winter or took several tries and it was brand new!!  I don't have to tell you how happy I was to get a company car (Grand Prix- extremely reliable!) and I just recently sold my Saturn.  I was so eager to get rid of it that I took the first offer that came along, even though I ended up eating a couple thousand dollars.  

The moral of this story is that the only people I've ever heard say anything good about the Saturn is Saturn itself, but try asking the people that get stuck with an unreliable Saturn. Sure, they treat you nice when you go in there for repairs, but I would rather get treated like most car dealerships treat you, and have a reliable vehicle,  then have to spend hours in a repair waiting room while people are trying to be nice to you.
