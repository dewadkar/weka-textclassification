            I love my Montana.  I surfed the web, researched, test drove, and bought the perfect van -- almost.
  This van has the most powerful standard engine in it's class (3.4 L), drives wonderfully in snow with the traction control (I was skeptical about that new feature, but living in snowy PA, with a steep driveway, I've rarely gotten stuck), and has storage features galore.  Let me tell you why I bought this van instead of the old stand-by Dodge Caravan.   
     1. It was the only other van besides Dodge at the time with a passenger sliding door.  (Now you have 5 or 6 to choose from).
     2. It had 8 passenger seating capacity with very mobile seats - my favorite thing.  I've been amazed how many times I've had every seat filled.  The Dodge has heavy bucket seats or bench seats that take two people to safely take out of the van when you need more space.
     3. The great rebate program, interest rate, and service of my Pontiac dealer made it worth the wait while they found the van with just the options I wanted.
     4. The engine is more powerful than any minivan I have driven, and has a long track record, having been used in the older &quot;ugly dustbuster shaped&quot; Pontiac Transports from a few years ago.  It is indispensible when passing Amish Buggies on these hilly PA roads, and on the highway at full speed.
     5.  The space to carry stuff (unlike the Toyota or Mercury's).  This is made possible by the individually movable seats that can be reconfigured easily, and moved by one person -- even my wife.  I can carry full 4x8 sheets of plywood, and have done so several times.  It helps to put a few shorter pieces of wood on the floor first so you don't scratch the plastic molding at the rear opening or snag the carpeting when sliding the plywood in.  What other vehicle, (besides a fullsized-extended cap truck) could haul five people, PLUS groceries, PLUS 11 sheets of 4x8 paneling (stowed on edge between the removable middle and back half seats)?  This one did.
     6.  The power-sliding door is VERY convenient with my little kids who couldn't normally close or open the door themselves.  The power door operates from the remote Keyless entry, as well as the driver seat or passenger seat.  It can be disabled from the drivers seat in case curious fingers like to punch the button too often (although it is automatically disabled while driving, you can open the door manually in an emergency.)

Other features that I consider extra's but I have learned to appreciate are: In-cabin air filters, Power rear windows, Auto-leveling shocks, built in air compressor (I've used it in an emergency), rear 12V power plug (we use it to plug in our electric Igloo cooler), self-sealing tires make nail holes leak slower, and the 24 hr. roadside assistance (when I ran out of gas, they brought it and I just paid for the gas).

I bought my Montana new in '98 and have over 35,000 miles.  I would call it perfect in every way (driving, comfort, styling, flexibility, serviceability, and features), EXCEPT: I've had a handful of warranty items that have needed to be taken care of.  Things like: moisture in the headlight (happened to both), a seatbelt that got stuck and had to be replaced, a cross-threaded lug nut, a cracked grill, a temperamental power sliding door, a faulty trip computer (I ran out of gas when it said I had 55 some miles left on this tank of gas), a power window switch that shorted out. (And now the latest thing, 12/16/99, the rear heater fan is blowing, but no air comes out. They plan to fix it on Monday, with 34,500 on the odometer.Yikes, 36K is just around the corner.) Everyone of these was quickly remedied under the 3 yr/36,000 mile warranty, thankfully.  But I'm a bit nervous about what happens after 36,000 miles.  These type of hardware problems are rated low in Consumer Reports on this van, so I guess I should have expected it, but not quite so soon.  Some of the interior storage compartments (i.e. for tapes, etc) seem a bit cheap to me, but the overall engineering is great.  Some might call these factory defects.  I call them annoyances.

Gas mileage is fair considering the size of this vehicle.  It gets 21 mpg on the highway, and 19 mpg bumming around town, getting 20 mpg overall (all according to the onboard trip computer).

Anyone expecting to haul more than four people should go with this comfortable minivan.  Definitely get the longer version.  You'd be surprised how often you need the bit of extra space behind the back seat.  I occasionally carry a few elderly people with me, and they always find it easier to get into my van than most cars, which you have to step 'down' into. Instead you just sliding in.  The middle row of seats fold up quickly to make room for entry into the back split-bench seat (accessible to kids and nimble adults).<br><br>
