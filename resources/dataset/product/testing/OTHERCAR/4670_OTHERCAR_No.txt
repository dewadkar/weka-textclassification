            In 1996 my mother bought a new Cavalier.  It was a great car and she seemed very happy with it, so the next year when I needed to buy a car, I bought the 96 Cavalier as well.  Mine was a program car and had 15,000 miles on it at the time of purchase.  It was a fine car for the first two years although the factory speakers were wired wrong and the factory radio had been replaced with an extremely cheap one that the mechanics didn't even install correctly.  Other than that, my only first complaint about the car was that the *plastic* covers that covered the metal bases of the front seats were cheap and didn't take long to break off, leaving sharp metal objects exposed to rip holes in more than one pair of pants as I entered or exited the vehicle.  Also, the covers over the metal attachment where the front seatbelts meet the wall of the car fell off, leaving more metal exposed.  The console between the front seats was made out of this same cheap material and was also put together so poorly that it came apart the first time I opened it.  There was a triangular shaped piece of the same material on the door, between the window and the frame of the door.  That also fell off.  I could go on about the cosmetic problems with the cheap interior.  By the time I'd had the car two years, the entire interior was falling apart.  I've driven cheap cars before, but when I paid what I paid for my Cavalier I didn't expect it to be so cheap, even if the problems were merely cosmetic ones.  For the first two years, the only mechanical services the car required were routine oil changes, battery replacement, brake pad replacement, etc.  The first major component to go out was the alternator.  My mechanic informed me he had noticed that alot of 96 Cavaliers were coming in at almost precisely 60,000 miles on the odometer with bad alternators.  Shortly after the alternator was replaced, the car died for no apparent reason.  I had to have the fuel filter replaced, and the car was leaking antifreeze so fast that I couldn't keep coolant in it, so that had to be fixed.  This summer, the air conditioner went out.  This was initially attributed to a possible leak, but we later discovered that the compressor was shot.  Then it turns out the head gasket was leaking.  About $1,000 and 1,000 miles later, the head gasket was completely blown.  Since the cost of replacing such a major component outweighed what I still owed on the car, I opted to park the old wallet leech and am now driving the first 96 Cavalier that my mother bought the year before I bought my pink lemon.  The pink lemon is now taking up space in the driveway and is not even paid off yet, so I have to keep making payments on it and have to keep paying to have it insured, even though it is no longer driveable and only has about 85,000 miles on it.  The first Cavalier, the one my mother bought brand new, has approximately the same mileage and still runs pretty well and has only needed minor work so far.  Maybe the good experience we've had with the first Cavalier should offset the bad experience we've had with the pink lemon, but I still wouldn't call one out of two a good success rate and therefore do not recommend the 96 Cavalier to anyone who is looking to buy a used car.
