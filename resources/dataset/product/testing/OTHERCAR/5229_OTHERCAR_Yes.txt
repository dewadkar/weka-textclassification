            This camera is so great that I bought two. One for my seven year old to use and one for myself. It is very sturdy. Can be banged around by a seven year old and still work great. Takes great pictures. And the size of the camera is such an added bonus. It is small enough to fit in my pocket. Many great features too, like the red eye reduction. So you never take one of those horrible shots again. And then spend all night removing them from all of your pictures. It has a self timer. Which I just love. And you can view your pictures on the tv. So when you are over to a friends or family members you can preview your shots, right there. I also like that I can purchase extra smart media chips, to take lots of shots. <br><br>
