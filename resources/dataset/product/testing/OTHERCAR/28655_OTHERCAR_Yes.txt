            A fun little camera!  

The DC-200 has been a great introduction to digital photography for my wife and me.  The downloaded photos look great on screen and the camera's interface is very easy to use.  And my mother- and father-in-law love getting pictures of our daughter the same day that we take them!

Relevant features:
- instant review of image on LCD
- optional date/time on image
- easy to operate menus
- very nice flash
- good color saturation

A couple of minuses:
- the memory card could be a little bigger
- the camera can be a little bit of a battery hog

We sometimes miss having a zoom, but we have learned to work around that with digital photo editing software.  It is really not a limitation any more.

While it is not the most sophisticated camera on the market, the DC-200 has a great balance of features for the price.<br><br>
