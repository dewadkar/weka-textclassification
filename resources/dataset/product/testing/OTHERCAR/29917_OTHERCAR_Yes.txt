            I am a sophomore in college and needed a car to get me to school and work...so I saved up enough cash for a down payment on a used car and the next thing I knew, I was the proud owner/financer of a white 95 Pontiac Sunfire. 

Well, I am not going to diss the car too much because it already had problems when I bought it, so I can't judge based on previous problems, I mean...who knows how the previous owners drove this car. 

Ok...from what I can tell, the Pontiac Sunfire has pretty good gas mileage. In fact, its better than pretty good, most of the miles I drive are highway miles, so I can go a long way on a single tank of gas. 

The exterior of the car is quite attractive actually, I was glad that there was no visible damage to the outside of the car. The only problem that I really have with this car, is the shape. I am used to driving a tiny Kia Sephia. 

The Pontiac Sunfire is much bigger than a Kia. I really think that this car was made and designed for a man and not a woman (I am not trying to sound chauvinistic or anything). 

It really does look like a sports car. 

My favorite feature about the car, aside from the fact that it has 4 doors and can fit many people, is the trunk space. Talk about incredible. The trunk in my car is absolutely huge, and it is the kind of car where the back seats can fold down from the inside, to get into the trunk. 

Currently, the air conditioner is not working, which is killer in Florida, but this was a previous condition...I'm still shopping around to find a mechanic who won't rip off a young gal such as myself. I never knew that air conditioning was so expensive. 

One thing I will say is that the Pontiac Sunfire is a very smoothe ride. The acceleration on the car is great and the car can go from zero to like 90 without you even noticing the slightest change ( I would know because when I'm on the interstate, I have to often slow down because I have no idea that the car drives so smoothly when going so fast). 

The gas and brakes are very light, the drop of a feather could initiate them...this is good and bad depending on what type of driver you are...don't get this car if you have heavy feet. 

When I am done paying the car off, I will have paid around 7000 for it. It has some 60,000 miles on it, but it is looking good. 

I am happy with my new car all in all, because it is a good car...but mostly because it is all mine.
