            I bought the 1999 Neon RT for 3 reasons. This buggy had the most room in it's class. The price was right, $16 ish. And it came with 1.9% financing.

I absolutely adore the looks of the car.  It is truly visually appealing.  Black, sleek.  It came fully equipped with a sunroof, CD player, wing, aluminum rims, and power everything. Not too bad for 16 grand.  The car handles incredibly well.  I have yet to zip around a corner or bend and feel any roll or slip at all.

I have always been a Japanese car owner.  The Dodge was my first American car, and haunted by stereotypes, I opted for the extended warranty.  Since I only have 23,000 miles on it, I have yet to use it, but I am pretty sure I will.

After 800 miles, the evil eyes of the &quot;Check Engine Soon&quot; light peered at me for 2 days. The problem, a &quot;Multiple Engine Misfire.&quot;  After being slightly annoyed at the fact I had to see the dealership so soon in the relationship I was building with my car, I got over it for the next 22,000 miles by being problem free.

At 23,436 miles, HELLO, that light started glaring at me again. I guessed at the problem, &quot;Multiple Engine Misfire.&quot; After doing some digging, I found out that there is a Technical Bulletin on this.  That means that the dealerships are aware of an ongoing problem.  Their solution as of right now, is to replace the valve springs.  Which I will have done this week.

When I sent the car in for a diagnosis, I also had the sunroof serviced.  After being opened probably 30 times in 2 years, it stopped working.

I also heard through the grapevine that there is a recall on the paint.  I am still looking into this.

Overall, I love my buggy.  The price is right, the car is appealing, and though it sports 150 horses, upgrades are relatively inexpensive. You could easily push over 200 horses, for $350.00.

I would recommend this car to anyone on a budget, and small families. 

A word of caution:  The factory tires where very well.  They are however aweful in the snow.<br><br>
