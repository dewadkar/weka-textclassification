            In November 1999 I purchased a Saab 9-5 sedan for my daughter. The vehicle was equipped with turbo 4 cylinder, sunroof, leather and the entire host of goodies standard to the 9-5.

Safety was the primary consideration for this purchase. My research, somewhat extensive on the internet, led me to believe there is no sedan sold in the US that exceeds the safety features or crash test results of the 9-5.

Since my daughter has undergone spinal surgery and has 2 steel rods in her back, I looked for the driver protection as a primary consideration in selecting a car for her. My daughter reports that the drivers seat is EXTREMELY comfortable and easy to adjust, even for long drives.

The reliability of the 9-5 is still undetermined, as the vehicle has 5,000 miles, it has required 2 repairs, both done at the same time.

The onboard computer kept reporting: &quot;Tighten Filler Cap&quot;, certainly no big deal but rather a minor annoyance. The dealer determined the cause to be a defective gas tank and replaced the tank. The dealer explained that the computer &amp; its sensors monitor various conditions of the gas tank for green reasons, fuel emissions being discharged into the atmosphere. As this did not effect the reliability, we elected to wait to have it repaired.

The second problem with the 9-5 was an absolute problem, the transmission shift selector would refuse to come out of the &quot;PARK&quot; position, this disabled the car from moving. My daughter sez she was always able to persuade the selector out of park, but found it disconcerting, as she felt she might have to call for help.

Upon bringing the car to the dealer, the problem was one the dealer was familiar with, having the same problem with other 9-5's. The problem is a solenoid that requires brake engagement to release the shift selector. 

Both repairs were made without a hitch and a loaner car provided. That sums up the problems with 9-5, if the vehicle runs trouble free from this point on, both my daughter and myself will be satisfied and give this car an otherwise OUTSTANDING RATING.

The Saab 9-5 is not just a safe car but a really great car to sit in and drive. I am rather large and &amp; I find the front &amp; rear seats outstanding. Living in Miami the climate control (AC) has to great and it is.

The features and goodies on this car are so numerous that it really makes you feel you are driving something really special. The fit and finish are outstanding.

The bumpers, color keyed to the paint of the car are reported to be 5 MPH, supposedly no damage inflected by hits of under 5 MPH, maybe so, but the bumper suffers the same stupid weakness of all these color keyed bumpers. They scuff easily and the cars look is compromised &amp; requires a couple of hundred bucks to repaint. Comï¿½on give us a break and give us a bumper that can be BUMPED.

If safety is a major consideration, and you love to drive a drivers car, that meets all luxury requirements, this car MUST be a top consideration.

I have to admit, I find excuses, just to drive it and my daughter LOVES it. I own and have owned a Lexus LS 400, Acura Legend, Acura 3.2 and Mercedes 300, THIS SAAB DOES NOT BOW ITS HEAD TO ANY OF THEM.

Update March 15, 2000: The 9-5 now has 8,000 miles, no further problems. If this keeps up the jury will come back with a verdict of one of the finer autos available of this sports (near or luxury) sedan.
