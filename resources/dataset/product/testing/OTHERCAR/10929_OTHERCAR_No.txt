                 Even though the BMW 3-Series is technically sophisticated car, it has lost some of the razor sharp handling of its predecessors.  Under normal driving circumstances, the driving is crisp, clean and quite fun, primarily due to its great turning radius, but when its presssed to its limits, the tail can get a bit figity.  This even true when the DSC (dynamic stablity control- new as standard equipment this year) is activated.  If you order the sport package, the matters are slightly improved.  
     Another big improvement, would be the engine.  Prior to this years model, the 323, only came with a 1.8 liter engine, this year BMW upped it to a 2.8 six.  The five-speed manual transmission shifts flawlessly, and the automatic is refined and smooth.  
     The interior is quite good, though a little conservative for mine and most peoples likes.  The controls are well laid out and easy to find though plain as I already mentioned.  Seats as a seperated entity in the front and back, are comfortable and firm, but in the back onece you mix the seats with leg room, its another story.  A a whole the interior gives you a cramped feel, although the rear seat room is improved for 2000.  
     Exterior styling is great.  For this year the grill was a little streamlined.  All in all a good car, a bit conservative, and my biggest complaint, the world renowned BMW handling is dwindling.  I say go for Audi's A4.  <br><br>
