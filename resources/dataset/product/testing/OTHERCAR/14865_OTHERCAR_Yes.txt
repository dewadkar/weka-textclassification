            This digital camera is wonderful! It's easy to use, takes wgreat, high-quality pictures, and has impressed everybody.

I worked on a smaller weekly newspaper that invested in this camera about six months ago do make deadline photography quicker and easier. When we first got the camera we thought it was going to complicate matters because it was a new system to get used to. We were nothing less than impressed with the performance of this camera. For business use, especially in the newspaper industry, this camera is a must-have.

For home use, if you can afford this camera, it is well worth the investment. With the Sony name behind it, you should not be disappointed.

Now for the technical stuff:
The camera photographs everything automatically at a 72 dpi resolution so that your photographs are already web-ready and all you will have to do is resize the picture to fit where you need it to go. If you need a higher resolution for a higher-quality publication, after you upload the photo into your computer, you can increase the resolution without distorting the quality of the photograph. Some cameras do not allow you to do this.

The Sony Mavica has several other features which allow you to photograph in Sepia tone, black and white, or solarized, in case you are looking for a unique effect in your photographs.

One small and relatively insignificant downfall to this camera is that all phot files are saved to a disk rather than on a chip on the camera, which means you have to carry around a few disks and each disk only holds between five and eight pictures.

There are so many features on this camera that I could write a novel, but take a look for yourself, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
