            On a sheer whim, my wife and I test-drove a 1999 Daewoo Lanos 4-dr hatchback.  The dealership has just shown up in town, and I wanted to try one of these cars for myself.

I will say, the standard features are impressive for a car this cheap.  Cars in the $10,000 price range usually skimp on radios and things, but this Lanos had a radio, rear defrost, height-adjustable seat, and several other nice options.  The seats were hard and flat, which some may like, but I do not...on the other hand, we drive a 1999 Volvo, which has seats designed by orthopedic specialists, so I'm a bit spoiled.

Under the hood, the motor (&quot;designed by Mercedes-Benz&quot; the salesman crowed) was well laid out, but already starting to corrode in several places.  Not a good sign for longevity.

On the road, the Lanos accelerated as well as could be expected.  There is no tachometer, so shifting the 5-spd manual was a guessing game -- especially considering the racket coming from under the hood.  The motor sounds like a Briggs &amp; Stratton lawnmower engine, and gets very loud under acceleration.  The brakes were already warped at 50 miles, and shook the car firmly.  The ride was typical econobox -- nothing out of the ordinary.  The car was stable at 55mph, and relatively unaffected by the slipstream of passing semi-trucks.

All in all, the Lanos seemed to be an affordable car which included a healthy dose of features, which were hopefully not traded for reliability.<br><br>
