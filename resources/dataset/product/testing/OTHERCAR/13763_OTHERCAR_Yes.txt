            I've learned my lesson well. The last Dodge vehicle I bought was a 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan SE. This vehicle lasted all of 68,000 miles before it fell apart. By the time I had 72,000 miles on it, I had replaced the engine, transmission, the front seats and had to completely repaint it and it was not even a full four years old.

I swore I would never buy another Dodge product again. Well, never say never. In August 1999 I broke my vows and bought a 1999 Dodge Ram Quad-Cab 1500 Sport, and at 23,430 miles I am happy to report that nothing can be finer in the state of North Carolina.

However, before I committed another sin, I did a lot of research and took my time to review all other comparable trucks. The first thing I did was talk to several mechanics to find out why my mini-van had total heart failure at such an early age. The answer was unanimous... your engine was too small.  &quot;When you buy Dodge products buy what Dodge does best...BIG engines.&quot;  So I ordered the 5.9 V-8 Magnum, bigger than what I will ever need but they live a long, long, long time (at least as long as the loan this time, I hope). 

I also ordered the leather interior package, since it brought with it the heavy duty front seats with a six way powered driver's.  Now having a Lincoln Continental I discovered that the powered driver's seat was a more ruggedly constructed seat than a non-powered. Since I am such a rugged type of guy, it seemed to make sense that I needed a better constructed seat, especially since my mini-van seats literally disintegrated beneath me.

Next I ordered the heavy duty tow package, since I just knew I was going to get a BIG boat that I was going to haul to the lake. (Haven't found one yet, but when I do you will hear from me.) Anyway, as a bonus I got an auxiliary transmission cooler (which the mechanics recommended).

Now you might think that with all the heavy duty mechanics and add-ons  that I would be getting the gas mileage of an M-1 Abrams Tank, but would you believe that I am averaging 16.2 miles to the gallon! Pretty good considering a lot of folks with smaller engines aren't getting much better.  This exact measurement is courtesy of the overhead on-board computer that even tells me which way I'm going. See, bigger is better! 

Well, I've got to go.  My wife is yelling at me to feed the dogs and change the oil in the truck. (By the way, the mechanics also said that the little book in the glove compartment tells you when and what to do to keep you from having to visit them other than socially.)

The bottom line folks is this - if you are going to spend up to $30,000 for a pick-up truck, get one with all the heavy duty packages and bells and whistles.  The only one I could find that gave me the best value for my money was the Dodge Ram.   Happy trails to you.        <br><br>
