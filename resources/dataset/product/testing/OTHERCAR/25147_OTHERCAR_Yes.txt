            I read practically all the reviews on the web before deciding to purchase this camera and I'm glad to say that most of the reviews I've read were right on the money.  This little camera does quite a bit even when packed into such a nice small package.  Being so small is very nice because it allows me to take it with me everywhere I go, which means I'm more likely to take pictures.  Other than the size, my favorite feature would have to be the movie mode which really adds value to the camera for those of us who don't own a video camera.  I'm an avid golfer and I've found it useful in recording clips of my swing to help me improve.  It can also be used to send quick messages and shoot it off in an email.  The other feature I really like is the stitch mode, which allows you to save panoramic shots and also create QuickTime VR movies as well.  This really wows most people who've seen what it can do besides taking great pictures.

The only negatives would be the battery life (I'd recommend at least having one extra).  For example, with the LCD screen on, it only takes about 50+ shots then you'd need to recharge it.  It also does not come with an AC adapter, which you would need to buy separately.  Another thing you'd need to purchase is a larger capacity memory card (the 8MB that comes with it is a joke really).  I paid about $107. for a 256 MB card and the large size does help because of the movie files that I capture.

Hopefully the next generation will allow larger movie files to be captured.  Currently, the average movie length you can capture is only 10 seconds.  Other than these minor annoyances, this camera has proved to be a great buy in my Epinion.
