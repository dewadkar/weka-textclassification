            Overall a good car, especially for the money.  We got the 5-Speed Manual transmission for more control and power but it still seems to be underpowered (even though the horsepower was upgraded since last year).  Tackling sharp inclines and off-road terrain makes the engine howl like it's dying.  Ironically, this lack of power is complemented by a rather loud engine. The Real time 4 wheel drive is also unpredictable, engaging at the last possible second.  If you won't be doing any off road driving with this car, however, it is fairly comfortable and the styling and Honda quality can't be beat.


ONE YEAR UPDATE:

Well I've been driving this little Ute for over a year now and even managed to go off roading.  Overall the car is a joy to drive.  It handles nothing like one of those bulky SUVs that are essentially pick-up trucks with leather seats.  Driving a CR-V is virtually like driving a sedan except that you have to be bit more careful when cornering.  You also get the advantage of a higher point of view.  Comparing it to a Jeep is like comparing apples and oranges.  You'll feel like you're riding in a tractor when you hop back into a Jeep.

It also handles snowy conditions like a charm.  I had no problem zipping around when the snow started to tumble.  As far as off roading goes - the car performed very well on over 250km of logging roads.  It has a clearance that's more than descent and the ABS really kicks in on loose roads.  The only time I had trouble was on a very steep hill where the car just could not make it.  Also the 4-wheel drive can't be forced so it takes a split second before it kicks in.  This is noticeable and sometimes causes you to spin out for just a bit. (A Jeep would not have these problems because it has low gears and the 4WD can be turned on permanently.)  Of course if you want to do serious off roading just get a real tough 4X4 like a Lada that can take a beating without even getting a scratch on the bodywork. 

I still feel the car is underpowered.  However because we have the manual transmission version you can effectively manage the performance of the vehicle.  Passing on the highway has to be done in third gear with the engine up in the 8000RPM range.  On the other hand if you drive in the city between 2-3k RPM the gas mileage is pretty amazing for an SUV.  I usually get 10km to the liter (about 24mpg).  With a Jeep I was lucky to get 18mpg. As far as further flaws go they are minor.  The picnic table in the trunk is just useless.  Engine noise could be improved.  Keyless entry is a bit finicky.

I've actually warmed up to this SUV even more since I bought it.  It has performed better than I ever expected, has had no mechanical problems whatsoever and is comfortable to ride in for long distances.  Unless you're planning to go up 45-degree inclines or through 6 feet of mud then it's also great for off roading.  Oh one last thing: you'll have to get used to people calling your SUV a truck like &quot;It's the green truck at pump 3 right?&quot;
