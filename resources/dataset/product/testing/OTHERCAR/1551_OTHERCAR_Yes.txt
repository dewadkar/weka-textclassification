            We'd never had a digital camera before, so we went for it. We were tired of film and not knowing if the pics came out (usually didn't).

The sound of the digic processor sounded good to me.

We love it. I can carry it in my pocket to Magic Mountain. In auto mode, somehow almost all of the pics come out great. I don't know how it does it.

It is really cool to look at the display and have it tell you where it is going to focus and meter from. 

I rarely use the other auto modes. Portrait mode doesn't make any difference in the house, there isn't enough depth and there isn't enough light to be able to deal with it. It still takes great pics, but no blurred background.

Program AE mode is cool, but full auto does such a great job we never use it. Manual mode is cool. I like taking 15 second exposures at night. But dissapointingly, shutter and aperture priority don't have the range of shutter and aperture settings that manual does. But that's okay, if it doesn't come out the way you want it on manual, change the settings and do it again.

You can use raw, but we don't. We got a 128 MB card for $40 and shoot EVERY picture at 4MP and don't worry about it. And the second-highest JPEG setting is fine for everything we do. That means each shot is about 1 MB. So we can get over a hundred pics on a card. 4MP just means we can blow up any pic we want, kind of like 35MM film that way, huh?

And I can fill a card or two on a battery charge, so we never worry about that either.

My wife doesn't like that you have to wait a second for it to focus (shutter lag). She feel like she misses a lot of cute kid pics that way. But good cameras have to focus and meter, so she's learning to push the shutter halfway, then wait for the cute pics.

On the lack of a lens mount: you can use photo stitch and it will automatically put any number of shots together, so you don't need wide-angle. Telephoto...what are you taking pictures of anyway?

And on the flash. I have not found this to be an issue. If you need a hot shoe, then get a studio camera or a G3. This isn't for you. But then, you wouldn't look at a pocket camera anyway, would you?

It is very addictive. We've had it 3.5 months and have taken 1400 pictures with it. Lots of great kid pics. The secret to great results is to take tons of pics of the same thing. We pick the best ones.
