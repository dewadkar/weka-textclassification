            While concluding a long day in the office I was small talking with one of my clients to realize that we both purchased black hatchback cars the previous week. Hatchbacks are a growing segment in a shrinking market (Cars, as opposed to Trucks and SUVs). Ford has the Focus ZX3 and ZX5, Toyota has the Matrix, Mazda the Proteg� 5 and a Mazda6 hatchback is about to be introduced, Chevy is coming with the Malib� MAXX and Pontiac markets the Vibe, a Matrix twin. Even Lexus has its hatchback the IS300 SportCross.

Anyone that has read my review of the <a href="/auto_Make-2003_Ford_Focus_Hatchback">2003 Ford SVT Focus 5-doors</a> knows how little reason prevailed in my decision on purchasing my car, but there may be few car that makes more sense than a hatchback. They make the best use of space without sacrificing looks and style, and you don't go around driving a thirsty elephant. Bottom lone you make the best of your dollars.

My client and I rushed to the parking lot to exchange drives in each other cars. His a Matrix XR with the 125 hp engine, mine an SVT Focus 5-door with the obvious power advantage of the SVT tuned 170hp engine.

The Matrix is a fantastic car, is everything you expect from Toyota. &#147Extremely well built&#148 and &#147relentless attention to details&#148 is shouted all over the car.

Sadly the Matrix was equipped with a 4 speed automatic transmission which in my book kills 60% of the fun-to-drive factor and should never be attached to any engine with less than 150 hp. Anyway, the engine felt very adequate and the car felt very well poised. The ride was Japanese soft, you know very subtle and comfortable without being floaty and disconnected. Brakes were very responsive


Where the Matrix really shines is in its interior appointments. The gauges are a joy to look at and a lesson in car design. I couldn't believe the 115V auxiliary power outlet in the dashboard. The seats sit high and give you the commanding view that SUV drivers give so much as a reason to buy their vehicles. My clients&#146 Matrix was equipped with cloth seats that looked durable and of good quality. Plastics and other trim feel good. You can read the word quality all over. Another nice surprise was the rubber covered cargo area with closed compartments, really neat.

In conclusion, this is a great car. I like the look of its twin brother the Pontiac Vibe better but I guess that is just a matter of taste and of course the ownership experience of a Toyota car apparently is much more rewarding.


While going back home in my SVT Focus that night, I couldn't help to draw a grin in my mouth as the 170 ponies kicked in while shifting my own gears sitting of my soft leather/cloth seats, listening to my 6-disc in-dash CD / 290-watt stereo with premium speakers and 8-inch subwoofer. Sweet!
