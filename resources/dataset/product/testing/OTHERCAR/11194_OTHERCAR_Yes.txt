            We bought our 1992 Buick Roadmaster (86,000 miles)sedan in 2001 after our 1992 Chevrolet Caprice (250,000 miles) was t-boned & totaled by a semi-truck that ran a red light.  We determined that if it weren't for the size of the Caprice, my wife would have been seriously injured.  Besides, we loved the Caprice and wanted something similar if for nothing else than it was a great value.  

A word about rear-drive cars and icy roads.  Before I bought my Caprice I spoke to taxi drivers, police officers and state troopers about their experiences in a rear-drive car.  Just don't over-drive the conditions of the roads.  Common sense? Yes, these people DEPEND upon their cars to get them around I figured if they weren't willing to be on the road driving their cars, I probably don't have any business important enough to be out either.

The Roadmaster is very similar to the Caprice but fully upgraded for the Buick market.  While not a Cadillac, the ride is very smooth and about 800 extra pounds of sound deadener keep it quieter than the Caprice hoped to be.  The doors feel heavier, the headliner feels thicker, even the feel of the carpeting feels more like a wool carpeting than the polyester in the Caprice.

The seating is great.  The leather is nice quality and holds up to my family very well.  I've two young children so two car seats dominate the rear seat.  However, there is still room for an adult passenger back there.  You can't do that in a smaller car.  The front seat backs are extra tall.  For those who like to drape an arm over the seat back you're SOL.  The trade-off is that you have a very comfortable rest-stop bed.  The seats feel very supportive and my 34" legs don't require the seat to be all the way back into the rear seat.  The 60/40 split seats have a hint of a bolster but don't try to hold you to one position like the smaller cars do and nothing like the sports cars do.  

The 5.7L V8 is perfect.  Very reliable and efficient.  I've noted up to 25 mpg with the A/C on and as low as 18 with city driving in the winter.  My mechanic has mentioned a carburetor lift kit that he has installed on all his V8s.  He notes an increase in power immediately and a corresponding 3 - 4 mpg increase.  That'd put us close to 30 mpg.  A decent fuel additive could bump us over 30 very easily.  Freedom was a brand I used in my Caprice that normally gave us an extra 3 mpg.  Could you believe getting 32 mpg from a car this huge? I'll let you know when I get that done.

I haven't noted a problem with the brakes.  The car brakes well even on snow & ice.  The weight may have a roll in that, but it may also be that after driving for over 30 years on Iowa roads that I've come to respect the ice enough to allow room to stop.  My mechanic is a big fan of the Caprice/Roadmaster/98/Fleetwood and installed a higher density pad as soon as we bought the car as well as moving my cross-drilled rotors from the Caprice to the Roadmaster.  Hey, this is a very large, heavy car.  Inertia being what it is, it takes a lot to stop it.  Don't skimp on the quality of your pads or you'll be buying new brake pads yearly.  (That means stay away from the pads made in China.)

The trunk is very roomy.  My daughter's bicycle is normally back there with a full sized spare and we can still fit essentials for an extended weekend in there for two adults and two kids.  It is a choice of bike or stroller though.

I've never had a problem with transmissions on any of my GM cars.  They just never register in the problem line.  Nor have I personally had issues with rust.  I agree with another review in that the rubber side bumpers seem to need something extra to keep them in place.  I think the polished chrome they stick them to is too smooth to hold glue or any other adhesives.  If someone were to take some 60 grit sandpaper to the centers and use a good adhesive with that they should stick.  Again, I'll let you know if I decide to try that myself.

Do watch your alternator and water pump.  I replaced both on the Caprice as well.  Neither were expensive and neither required a tow.  If you're one to do your own automotive work, when you remove the shroud & cooling fan you can almost stand between the bumper and engine.  That makes if very easy to get to the water pump.  

I've also had some issues with the radio/tape player.  The radio has some problems pulling in stations at any distance.  I noted the same with my Caprice.  The Ford Tarus I drive pulls all stations in at least three times further out.  I've checked connections and can't find any reason for this deficiency.  The tape deck has eaten a couple of tapes.  The peg that advances the tape fell out after the last incident.  I believe if I want to listen to tapes from now on I'll have to buy a new deck that may also help the radio reception.

We also replaced the exhaust system at about 120,000 miles.  The ice-melt on Iowa's roads could have had something to do with this.  I didn't have a problem with the Caprice.  But, this car has two, count 'em, two mufflers on the same pipe.  We were basically running straight pipes for about a month before we got it into the shop.  Talk about a difference!  That also makes a full exhaust system a bit on the pricey side. 

A minor detail is a broken clip on the driver's window.  This also broke on the Caprice.  The clip connects the window motor to the glass.  When it breaks, you have to help the window up and down, keeping it straight in the tracks.  On the Caprice, you could buy the clip by itself.  On the Buick's motor, that clip comes only with a motor as well.  About $300 or so just for the part.  My mechanic called around and found a clip for me.  The last one in Des Moines according to him.  Saved me about $285.  

The courtesy lights are mounted in the bottom of the rear-view mirror.  I've always disliked dome lights as they blind everyone in the car with direct light.  These direct the light were you need it and wash the entire front seat in light without shining in your eyes.  My wife can have the light on and I can drive without being blinded every time I look into the rear-view.  There's also a very nice compass built into the rear-view mirror that comes in handy more often than I would have thought it would.

There are enough interior storage compartments to hold distractions for two kids.  The center arm-rest opens up with cup holders that are much nicer than some others I've seen.

The insurance company seems to like these cars as well.  Iowa's vehicle licensing policy makes an older car more attractive for me as well.  We've the comfort without the high costs.  This car seems to hold its value a bit better then the Cadillacs do as well.  None of the options on this car feel delicate like some in the Cadillacs I've been in and they aren't cutting edge (even for '92).  By that I mean the first year or so a technology comes out is the year I want to avoid.  Let someone else beta test, I've enough issues coming from the two kids in the back without trying to figure out why the wipers or lights are suddenly on.

Given the option, I'd go for the wagon.  The extra seating would be nice and I've always liked the sun-roof over the back seat.  But, this is the best car I've ever owned, I've had several, from Ford, Dodge/Plymouth/Chrysler, & Audi.  The Ford products are a close second.
