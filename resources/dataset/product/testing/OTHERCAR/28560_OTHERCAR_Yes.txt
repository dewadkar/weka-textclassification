            As you may have read in some of my other reviews, I'm not much of an SUV fan.  Yet again, however, I am finding myself with an appreciation for yet another SUV.  Not a love, just a slight understanding of why someone might buy one.  This time around it is the Jeep Wrangler Sahara.

My friend just got this Jeep a few months ago, right when Florida (where I live) was getting cold.  Apparently the fact that the Jeep is so basic in design doesn't mean it can't be civilized.  My friend reported that even in 30 degree weather the Jeep warmed up commendably quick.  I was skeptical, so I held off driving it for a while.

Once temperatures climbed above 70 it was time for a road trip to the beach.  This Jeep is the ultimate in cruising-the-beach cool.  Take the doors off, pull down the windows, and presto! an instant dune buggy.  But oddly enough there's more to like about the Wrangler than mere simplicity.  It actually rides decent (for such a proven off-roader, anyway), is relatively nimble (at least for an SUV), has great visibility, and is downright sprightly.  Equip with the smooth-shifting 5 speed manual as in my friend's and this thing is a sleeper.  And if you get the engine excited it makes some wonderful mechanical stirrings.  The light weight is what I think contributes most to these attributes.  On the soft sand of New Smyrna Beach (a non-tourist haunt just south of Daytona) the Wrangler couldn't be denied traction or forward progress thanks to its legendary off road capability.

In addition the Wrangler is also quite easy to maintain.  Good gas mileage for the 4.0L in-line six and a &quot;spray it out&quot; interior mean upkeep is relatively simple.  The engine bay is easily accessible (maybe too easy) and oil changes are a snap thanks to the high ground clearance afforded by the suspension.  All in all, a great bargain for such a venerable marque.
