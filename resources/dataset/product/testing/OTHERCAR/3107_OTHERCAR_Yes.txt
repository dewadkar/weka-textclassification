            My mother owns the 2000 Hyundai Electra GLS, 4-door Sedan.  After experiencing costly engine problems with her 1994 Hyundai Sonata, which was a nice powerful V6 car, she purchased the Electra in May of 2000.  Even though the Electra�s 2.0-liter DOHC 4 cylinder engine is a step down from the Sonata�s V6 engine, it can still keep up with any V6 vehicle.  She purchased the Electra for its �in the budget� price of 13,500, its Hyundai warranty, its safety and performance, and for its roomy interior.  This car is covered under a nice Hyundai warranty, but the only downside to that, is the fact that after reaching 50,000 miles � you have to purchase additional warranty.  Which is not a bad thing, but for people with budgets, it can be a problem.  The car standard features include all power, Cass. Player, and driver side/passenger airbags.  The car is very roomy.  It�s a lot of leg and headroom upfront; the back may seem small to some, considering on how much legroom you need.  It�s a lot of truck space, you can fit around a total of 7 brown groceries bags in it.  And the drop down back seat provides even more storage room.  This car has very nice engine performance and handling.  We have driven this car on the highway at a high speed of 90mph, and I can honestly say that this car handled beautifully.  The steering wheel never jerked to the right or left, and the engine never once made a struggling noise, it was smooth riding.  So this car performs very well under high speeds.  We really didn�t experience any major problems with the car yet, but we did have to replace the starting cable just 2 months after buying the car because it was rotted.  Just recently, the car�s body paint started melting, a result of the hot summer weather.  It�s numerous little dime size spots where you can tell the paint is melting because when you touch the spot the paint is liquidly, and you can see the metal of the car, it's starting to show all over the car.  My mother still have the car after two years with 21,000miles on it.  Overall this is a nice car to own, especially to drive.
