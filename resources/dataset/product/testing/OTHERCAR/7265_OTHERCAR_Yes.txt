            How would you like to surprise your loved ones this time of the year?  You can do so with a simple present that will speak volume.  If you are living the American dream, you are like the rest of us, with parents scattered all over the states and the globe.  Staying in touch with them becomes more and more urgent especially when the grandkids start asking questions about grandpa and grandma.  Digital photography has come to shorten that great distance.  Extended families can remain abreast of their loved ones' news and progress.  <b>Minolta F100 Zoom Digital Camera</b> is the right camera that can help family members to bond once again.  With the popularity of e-mail and customized web albums, this camera is the right addition to the family's set of equipment.  In my interaction with my friends and some customers who ask me for assistance, I have never hesitated to let them know that their needs should justify the purchase of a specific camera.

<b>Why should anybody invest in this camera?</b>

Well, if you are looking for superior performance and style, then you'd better go with the best on the market.  There again, it's all relative to your needs.  If you are only a beginner, obviously your needs will be drastically different from those of a professional or an intermediate user.  They may need to get some specific results.  Don't let the preceding statements fool you when it comes to which cameras to use to e-mail pictures to your loved ones or post them on your sites.  All digital cameras can meet this basic need.  The Minolta Dimage F100 comes loaded with 4 megapixels.  For sure, your pictures will have a higher resolution.  Keep in mind that the higher the resolution, the more megapixels are in use, the sharper the image will be when blown up to larger and larger sizes.  When we are talking about low resolution, we mostly see cameras with less than a megapixel.  Don't fall into that trap.  Buy a camera you can be proud of for some time.  The Minolta Dimage F100 is one of the top cameras on the market right now.  It can give you superb quality pictures.  With 4 megapixels, your images can only be great even after you do all the editing, cropping etc.  The chance is that these images will still look great.  The DiMage F100 is one of Minolta's best outputs so far.  No matter what your current status is, you will find great joy using it for your various work-related and home projects. So far, all I have heard from my friends and customers who have used it is just praise for its standard features.

<b>What are some of the features you will fall for in this camera?</b>

Using a PC platform, the Minolta DiMage can be used to record movies.  Fortunately, it uses the Lithium Ion batteries which can last much longer.  In fact, they are the best batteries you can get on the market right now.  It has a storage capacity of 16 MB.  It's already a given that this camera has a very high resolution.  A very important feature that all buyers should care about is the difference between <i> optical and digital zoom </i>.  It all comes down to the optical zoom being the better of the two due to the fact that in a camera such the Minolta DiMage F100 or any other one is like zooming in a film camera.  When you zoom, the image quality or resolution of the object is preserved.  The DiMage F100 uses 3x optical zoom/2.5x digital zoom and movie mode with sound.  It's a combination of the two features that will ultimately produce great images.

<b>Where can you catch the action?  Are you ready to take a few snapshots?</b>

<i>Point-and shoot</i>

With an affordable camera such as the DiMage F100, you can take images of your active life.  You can share the precious moments of your working life with others all over the world.  If you live on a farm, take pictures of your animals, livestock, poultry, cattle or the fruits from your orchards and the beautiful roses of your gardens.  Just take the pictures, download them into your computer, get down to the editing room whenever you have some time and get ready to e-mail or post them.  For sure, the Minolta can reduce distance.  If your kids don't stay in touch with their grandparents living on the other coast, it's not due to the lack of technology.  You can take it a few steps further by investing in webcams.  With the Minolta DiMage, you can be sure to always refresh, update pictures on your small business web page.  

LCD display, Disk Media Type:  Secure digital Multimedia

<b>Would it make a good present idea?</b>

If you want to give to give a memorable present this holiday season, you invest in this camera.  Its recipient will be grateful to you for your generosity.
