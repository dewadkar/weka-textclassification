               I have been in the market for a digital camera for several years.  Being a big visual-phile, I am an incredible stickler for the absolute best image quality.  This is the first camera to enter the market that had a quality sufficient to satisfy my criteria.
   When I first saw the specs for it, I though it was up to snuff.  After scouring every magazine, message board, and website (though not this one, did not know it existed) for reviews and opinions from people who had gotten a chance to use it.  After recieving the highest image quality at that time from c|net, I decided it was good enough for me.  I couldn't have been more right.
   The camera's images are beautiful.  The 1760 x 1168 resolution isn't the only thing that makes the images amazing.  All the hype around digital cameras focuses on the resolution.  That is only half of the criteria for the image quality of a camera.  In my opinion, the DC280 has very low CCD noise.  There is some, especially in the blue channel, but this is something common to all digital cameras.  Kodak does a good job of managing the problem.
   Besides, the CCD, the rest of the camera is on the same level.  The controls are thoughtfully laid out.  The most common controls have physical buttons, but many functions require require the use of the LCD screen on the rear.  The screen is very bright and has saturated colors.  The camera comes with powerful, rechargable batteries, and a charger.
   All in all, I would say this is a very good buy.  Especially because the large memory media included (I got a 32meg card from buy.com).  With the introduction of high-res cameras, this camera is dropping in price.<br><br>
