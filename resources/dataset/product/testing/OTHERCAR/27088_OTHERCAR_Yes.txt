            Let me start with a little bit of my automobile history. I was the proud owner of a brand new solid black 1999 Dodge Viper GTS back in November of 1999. I kept the car for 14 months before I sold it. I had previously owned a 1997 Corvette. Before that, I owned a 1995 Corvette, a 1992 Acura NSX, and now I own a 2000 Corvette. 

Let me start off with the positive aspects of the Dodge Viper GTS. 

1) It has unbelievable power and torque. I was able to run 12.4 @ 116 mph in the quarter mile on a STOCK engine. 
2) It is probably the best looking sports car made. (This is subjective though.) 
3) It was surprisingly reliable. I had ZERO problems with it in the 14 months that I had it. I never had to take in into the service department ONCE. I can't say that about my 1997 Corvette or my 1992 Acura NSX. I believe part of this has to do with the fact that it has almost no creature comforts, i.e., there's a lot less gadgets and computers to break down (compared to a Corvette, for example.) It's also due to the fact that the engine is hardly stressed at all.  What I mean is, for an engine with 8.0 L of displacement and 10 cylinders, it doesn't put out a whole lot of horsepower (only 56.25 HP per liter, or 45 HP per cylinder).  There's just not a whole lot of stress on the engine, it SHOULD last a long time.
4) It is very exclusive. You won't see many of these machines on the road. 
5) It holds it's value very well. 
6) It handles superbly, like it's on rails. 
7) Up until 1999, the engine parts were forged aluminum, which is stronger than cast aluminum.  They will handle power modifications much better.  All Vipers built after 1999 have cast aluminum parts in the engine.
8) It's just plain fun to drive. 

Now for some negative aspects of the car 

1) The air conditioning is not very powerful. In the hot Texas heat, the air conditioning is almost inadequate. 
2) The car builds up exhaust dirt on the rear bumper very fast, you have to clean it every time you drive it. 
3) It IS an expensive car. I paid $78,000 with luxury tax and gas guzzler tax. Putting $10,000 down and financing over 5 years gives a $1412 per month payment. 
4) It gets awful gas mileage. Mine averaged 10 - 12 mpg. 
5) If you are into modifying the car for performance, it is extremely expensive. Just a set of headers costs $4000. (For a Corvette, headers cost around $800) 
6) Every time you stop to get gas, some kid will come up gawking at the car and asking if he can see the engine. This gets annoying after a few months. 
7) Opening the hood to see the engine is a pain, it requires that you unlock a latch in the front of the car, then you have to go back to the windshield and pull the large clamshell hood open like a Corvette. It can be opened without the use of a key either, even when the car is locked! Not good. 
8) In order to even see the battery, you need to remove the rear wheel, the battery is stored behind it. 
9) It does not have ABS, traction control, cruise control, climate control, or a cup holder. There is no travel computer or outside temperature readout. (All of which are available on the Corvette, for example.) 
10) People automatically assume you are a rich snob. Which makes daily driving a hassle. 
11) The ride is somewhat rough at times. 

I REALLY enjoyed my Viper, but I eventually got tired of it for some of the reasons I listed above. I decided to go back to a 2000 Corvette.
