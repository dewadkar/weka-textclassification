            You're on the verge of upgrading your car to something a little nicer. You want performance, comfort, and a sexy design, all for less than $40K. While the 2000 BMW 328Ci may be a bit more pricier than similar cars in its class, its performance and handling make it a temptation hard to resist.

1. Performance - Get the 2.8L 6 cylinder and you'll enjoy every bit of zippy acceleration. The car is equipped with rear-wheel drive, common in most BMW models, which makes a noticeable difference when turning or changing lanes quickly. If you want an additional edge, there's also the new 330, which has a 3L straight six engine. [FYI, previous year's 323s are now correctly named 325s (2.5L engine) and they are also being sold as a 2-door coupe for a little less $$$]

The &quot;Dynamic Stability Control&quot; feature is a nice touch. The car's computer senses when the wheels are slipping (when there is less traction), and compensates by directing more power to another wheel. The DCS light flashes when the system is needed, although its ready at any time. If you're stuck in mud or snow, you can turn it off with the push of a button to let your wheels spin.

2. Comfort - I'd recommend the optional leather seats. You feel very snug and natural in them. If you really want to go all out, you can purchase the optional heated seats. The seats, of course, can be programmed for more than one driver; this is a cool feature if you and your spouse prefer different settings.

Even though the 328Ci is a 2-door, there is ample room in the back for two people, but less leg room than in the 5-series vehicles.

3. Sexy design - the curvy look of the 328Ci gives the car a more aerodynamic, sporty appearance. The lower fog lights are a nice touch. Also, there is a dual exhaust positioned towards the left of the back side.

Other nice touches:

- Control the car stereo system from your steering wheel! If you've never had a car with this feature, you'll never go back to the standard stretch out your arm until it's sore routine. Switch between stations, change volume, etc.

- Multiple ways of controlling the inside temperature. You can set a specific temp (like 75 degrees), and the car will adjust air flow as necessary. Or you can manually control it.

- On-board computer gives you odometer reading, MPG, range (miles left until you run out of gas, as I like to call it), and outside temperature. And you can access this info from the steering wheel too.

- One touch everything! Open/close windows, sunroof (optional, but definitely worth it), and doors with one touch.

- As is becoming standard in many new cars, your car keys can be used from outside of car to unlock/lock doors, open trunk, and one other bonus: simultaneously opening all windows and sunroof by holding the open door button for an extended duration. Very useful on those hot sunny days!

- Safety features: dual front and side airbags! In third-party tests conducted for insurance purposes, BMWs are on top during head-on collision simulations. The sturdy frame does not collapse as easily as on other autos.

- And of course, cupholders and change holder/bank.

BMW sells this model at an MSRP base price of $33K. If you want options, you'll be closer to 40K faster than you can say &quot;autobahn.&quot; Also, most dealers will tack on a luxury tax, not to mention registration fees. Other competitors may offer more value in terms of options.

In my opinion, this car is ideal for couples or single folks ready for a &quot;real&quot; car. It's a great car for both city driving and commutes to and from the suburbs. I've driven it from the Bay Area to Southern California and back, and the ride was significantly more comfortable than in previous vehicles that I've owed.
