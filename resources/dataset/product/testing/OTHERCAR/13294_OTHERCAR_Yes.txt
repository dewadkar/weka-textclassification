            Approaching 70,000 miles, 1999 EX V-6 Accord has been very reliable and comfortable car to own. The V-6 has been the best part of this car. 

I wish the car had better handling to match the engine. In sharp corners, the car leans and doesn't feel tight to go around with confidence.

The quality of materials used in interior is very good. The dashboard is clean and no cheap plastics!  The front seats are comfortable but lack lateral support. One more thing about the seats. As a tall person I wish the headrest would tilt forward to support my head better!  With lowering the seat using 8-way driver seat, you could get good headroom for 6'2'' person like me with sun, sorry, moonroof with tilt.

The road noise does come in more than I like but overall it's average noise level. I found some noise coming from the fan and started to hear some rattles near the passenger side of dashboard. 

As for repair and maintenance, I had to replace one side rear wheel bearing and headlight halogen bulb. 

It's hard to complain about 1999 Accord EX V-6. I still get good mpg for V-6. I average around 22 to 26 MPG.
