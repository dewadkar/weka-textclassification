            Here it goes:

I've owned this S2000 since June of 2002. I paid $49,000 Canadian (equal to the $32,000 MSRP for the U.S.) and it's worth it. It's no exaggeration when people have described this car as a go-cart on tracks. You point, you drive. It's that simple. There are no sounds emanating from the body, just the engine-and only if you could ever get used to driving above 6000RPM. And yes, there are 3000 more RPM's to go!

I purchased this car because I needed somthing small enough to park, and negotiate city traffic. I've read reviews that people only used the S2000 as a second car, and that it's not practical for daily driving. That I'll never understand. Mine is used for business driving in the city-everday. That includes the rain. There are no problems that I've experienced. I've read that some feel  the S2000 can give you nightmares around corners in the wet. Humm, I guess if your testing what the car "could" do in the wet, then yes, you'll lose it-and quickly. I suspect that experience might be shared with other high performance vehicles too.

Nearly every time I run an errand or simply go for a drive (with the lovely wife), we are approached by people. Everyone wants to talk about it. Most love it, some don't. Everyone has an opinion. That's fine. Just add a few minutes to your schedule to accomodate. I can't speak for the U.S., but you do not see S2000's on every corner. That's another reason I love this vehicle.

Oh, back to the rain, well there is one thing I don't appreciate. When it rains, and if you have the window powered down, there will be a slight trickle of water falling from the top edge of the A-Pillar (where it meets the canvass). Unfortunately, it will fall on your BRAND NEW ARMANI PANTS!! Sorry.

Is it fast, yes. Is it quick, well, kind of. I've driven 12 sec 1/4 cars and everything else is slow. I would not purchase the S2000 if you looking for street-light encounters (not to mention it's illegal). I'll be surprised if (at a designated track with 0 elevation), I could muster 14.0 seconds. However, from a rolling start, look out. This car is not for someone who just got their licence. That's for certain. If you know how to drive (and I mean safely), you'll enjoy it.

As for the room, well, it does not have a lot. But don't buy it thinking you could transport a TV set. This vehicle was made for one thing and one thing only; to enjoy every aspect of road driving. It's a true roadster. Right down to the racing sound of those RPM's. Honda obviously learned from it's F1 racing (and CART).

Enough rambling. Enjoy.
