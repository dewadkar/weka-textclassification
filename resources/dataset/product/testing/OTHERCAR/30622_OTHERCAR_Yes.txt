            This vehicle was purchased after becoming sick of the repetitiveness of Cadillac at the time.  We have owned every Aurora since its beginning year.  They only continue to get better.  This car has quite a bit of pick up.  The engine (V-8) is quite capable of beating others off the line.  The exterior is impeccable.  We have had several small problems with the cars: a window that won't go up or down: it just got stuck midway, a latch on the truck that wouldn't work and would release, and some problems with the wood paneling splitting on the console.  Driving this car is like a moving living room.  Though in no means a large (Cadillac) car, this car is comfortable enough to take 2 adults, 2 18 year old kids, and a dog on a 21 hour drive...straight through.  Imagine doing that in most cars.  THe 
stock speakers are nice..but they do offer an option of speakers located all throughout the car.  I do recommend this.  This car comes fully loaded...in fact, the only thing we added was a sunroof.  Leather seats, tilt wheel, auto locks/windows, security alarm, keyless entry, fog lights...you name it, is has it!  I recommend this vehicle to those that want to feel sporty yet not compromise safety and comfort.<br><br>
