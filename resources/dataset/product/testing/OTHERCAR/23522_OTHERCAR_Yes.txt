            I'm a current '96 9000 Aero owner who's dearly loved his swedish luxury rocket. But, as of yesterday afternoon, my heart belongs to another.

Lordy, what a ride! Not the fastest, perhaps. You'll never keep up with a significant array of road warriors out there. On a dry road, C5 Vettes, M5 Beemers, 911s, will all walk away from the S4. But the bigger picture is something else. 

I'm in the New England snow belt, so superior winter mobility (particularly among witless SUV drivers) ranks high on my commuting agenda. The S4 with properly selected snow-sneakers will be hard to top in all conditions except deep snow (clearance).

And, to be fair, on any surface but open highway, there aren't a whole lot of cars out there that will beat the S4 for flat-out point-to-point times. 0-60 in 5.9 secs may not be earth-shattering, but it's plenty damn quick viewed against the majority vehicles out there (my Aero, by comparison, is around 6.7). Coupled with the broad torque curve, and a well-apportioned 6-speed tranny, the platform inspires confidence across-the-board.

The virtual invisibility of the ultra-bland styling is ideal for those of us who prefer to enjoy our motoring superiority 'under the radar'. Most highway patrol and pony-car drivers will never know what they're looking at. Bon Appetite!
