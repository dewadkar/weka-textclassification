            I purchased the Olympus 450 zoom as my first digital camera.  I had done some research and decided it was the best choice for my needs.  I bought my cam in February and have enjoyed my experiences with it.  I tend to take my camera with me most of the time and have captured some wonderful pictures.  The ease of learning the camera was surprising.  The manual looked large and overwhelming, but is explained concisely and very easy to understand.  I have recommended this camera to many people already. I feel the quality is well worth the price. I've had a very good experience so far and am pleased with the Olympus 450 zoom digital camera.  <br><br>
