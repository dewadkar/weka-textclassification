                 I have a new baby. It's not made of flesh and bones but rather smooth, shiny metal, plush cloth, and vinyl.  For those of you who have read my other reviews, you know I drive a Volvo. Not anymore. My sister got a 4-Runner as a graduation gift, so she gave the Camry to me, so I gave the Volvo back to my mum. (She deserves it.) Granted, it's not as luxurious as my previous vechicle, but it has my personality.<P>    For starters, it's black, which is my favorite color.  It has sleek, graceful lines like a shark. Aesthetically speaking, it's easy on the eyes.  Then you slip into the driver's seat.  My seats are grey cloth that has a funky purple pattern on it. They're comfortable, but I wouldn't want to sit there for hours on end. The seats can be adjusted without hassle and the steering wheel can be tilted to accomodate you. The dashboard is well designed, and you can see all your gauges without obstruction. My one complaint is the placement of the clock.  It's off to your right and is tilted to the passenger side, which can be annoying sometimes because to have to lean over to see what time it is.  Cruise control is a separate little lever that is wonderful and very easy to use. Trunk, hood, and gas release levers are located to your left near the floor.<P> Now on to what really matters...<P> THE CUPHOLDERS!!!! In my Volvo, they would slide out of the center console and teeter over the master controls for windows and locks. I'd always be paraniod about spilling my drinks because the holders didn't hold large drinks so I'd have to stradle it while driving.  But the Camry cupholders are deep, can hold very large drinks, <i>and</i> keep them from spilling. The backseat passengers also get the luxury of two cupholders that pop out of the back of the console toward the floor. I can't help it, I'm easily impressed.  The radio is generally easy to use, but adjusting the bass and treble involve skilled dexterity, the damn knob is tiny! My CD player is very simple, just push the CD in and press the ejector to get it out. Easy enough. The console is also wondeful.  It holds all my CDs with enough room for napkins and random found objects. It's a good place for parents to keep small toys. Climate controls are well placed and easily adjusted while driving.<P> Now we venture to the backseat. it's generally roomy and comfortable with three-point seatbelts for three passengers. There's not much to say about it, all the cool stuff is upfront. I just use the backseat to hold my books.<P> What about performance?<P> Just one word: <b>Wow</b>. This baby has some major get up and go! Superb acceleration with a quiet, smooth ride. I always find myself speeding and not knowing it. =) It hugs the curves and has responsive braking. Now what I had expected from a typical family car! In my book, it drives better than the Volvo 850. It's also just as safe. Do the research. Oh yeah, it also has airbags standard. In my eyes, safety is just as important as the other aspects of a car.<P> I have also personalized my car too. Leopard dice and steering wheel cover spice it up in my eyes. I also have a leopard air freshener, a Simpsons air freshener, and a Bettie Page one, too. Soon to come are bumper stickers Yes, this is an average family car, so don't be afraid to mix it up a little! Hope this was helpful!
