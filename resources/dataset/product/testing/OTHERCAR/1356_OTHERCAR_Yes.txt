             The Chevrolet Silverado and its sister GMC are very good vehicles and the styling while conservative is very nice, while there were rumors of the frames cracking while it was in development these were completely untrue, The frames are Hydroformed and extremely strong and the Gen-3 engines are the best yet, and the new 5-link rear suspension gives them an excellent ride without sacrificing its ability to be used as a truck (its a fact most people don't use trucks as trucks that is why GMC has thier 1 percenter commercial). The seats are very comfortable even for long road trips especially the up-level trim seats which have power lumbar support and can be heated, However the trucks do have some flaws that must not be overlooked, if you are going to buy a used vehicle. The outer box sides on the older trucks are still steel and susceptible to damage while the newer trucks will have plastic outer box sides to prevent things like door-dings and similar damage that could happen in the mall parking lots etc. There is also a whole lot of plastic in the interior trim, but this is true for any vehicle in this class<br><br>
