              I bought this truck because I was tired of my little volkswagen and I've always loved trucks.  I couldn't afford a Pre-Runner or a Ford F-150 like I wanted, but I did want a pickup truck.  I settled on the little Tacoma because it was half the price of a full sized truck and was still good looking.  I was excited and happy at first, but I soon grew very tired of this truck.
  
  For 13,000 I got a cute pickup truck with nothing really in it.  It was a stick shift manual transmission, a tape deck (no CD) no power windows or doors, no extended cab, no bedliner, a 4 cylinder engine, and it did have air conditioning.  It also had a bench seat that did not split.

  The car got good gas mileage, but not as good as I would've expected for a car you can practically pick up by yourself.  It also wasn't fast at all (at least the 4 cylinder wasn't) so I don't understand why it only got 20-24 miles to the gallon.  Granted, my V8 Tundra only gets 16-19, but at least it's a powerful and fast 8 cylinder.  

  Mechanically speaking I never had a problem in the year that I owned it, and I did beat that car up in that one year.  What did I do to that car?  Well, I put over 20,000 miles on it in the first 10 months, and I only got one oil change, at 15,000 miles (they recommend you do it every 3,000 miles).  I also broke the front headlight, tried to tow a travel trailer with it and probably cut quite a few years off the transmission, and I totally wrecked the back bumper and scratched the bed up.  But it never even threatened to break down and I'm fairly confident that it never would have.  I'm a big believer in reliable Toyota cars and trucks.  

  I didn't like that the truck was so cheap.  I understand that you're not getting the best car if you only pay $13,000, but I feel that it could've been better.  I've seen higher quality cars for less than that before.  On the other hand, I'm sure the Tacoma will far outlast the other cars and will need far less repairs along the way.  But I'm not the kind of person who needs or wants to keep a car forever anyway.  I'm usually done with cars after 4 or 5 years, and I was not pleased with this one.  Now, I've been in Tacomas with all the fancy features, and those are some quality cars.  I just happened to pick the one they REALLY held back on.  

  PROBLEMS WITH QUALITY: before this Tacoma, I had never seen a car that didn't have a glass dash piece to go over the speedometer.  There are pieces around the individual instruments, but there isn't even a plastic plate to encase them in the dash.  It looks bad.  

  The emergency brake pulls out from the dash under the radio in the fat middle of the car.  That's fine except you have to pull it when you park and then there's this big stick in the middle of the floor of your car.  It looks bag and it's impossible to unload stuff from the floor with that in the way.  Also, my roommate kicked it once and knocked it in, which made the car roll down the driveway and hit another car parked on the street.  My insurance went up because by law you have to pull the E brake and put the car in gear every time you park.  Now I know.  

   The bench seat that did not split was a real problem for me.  I am not a tall person, but I have A LOT of tall friends.  So everytime we drove somewhere, my friend's legs were crushed up against the dash and glove box so I could reach the pedals.  The seats were also really cheap.  When I put the seats forward to put something in the 6 inch space behind them, there wasn't even any fabric on the back of the seats.  You could see the padding and wire frame of the seats, and it looked like it had cost them a dollar to make and they had thrown it together without a thought to durability or safety.  If I had known that the bench seat did not split, I probably would not have bought the car.  I think that is the dumbest thing a car could ever have and it's the worst way for a car company to cut corners. 

  I did not get the extended cab and that was a HUGE mistake.  This car just will not fit three people in the front like it claims.  How are you supposed to shift when someone's legs are in the way?  I'll tell you.  You can't.  The person in the middle has to work the shifter while you do the pedals and steering.  Try coordinating that sometime and see if you can do it.  You have to constantly tell them what gear to shift to.  Forget that.  Also, there is no room at all behind the seat.  If I didn't have much, I could fit my backpack.  It's totally useless.  So essentially you're buying a pickup truck disguised as a Mazda Miata.  Totally useless if you ever want more passengers.  

  The truck is fine for hauling just like any pickup.  I used the bed of the truck maybe twice.  It's totally stupid because you can't lock the stuff up when you put it back there, so the bed is only good for a one-way trip back from somewhere.  This is true of any pickup, but I had to experience to find that out.  Also, without a bedliner, the bed of the truck gets scratched really easily.  If I hadn't traded that in, it would've rusted and rotted through in no time.  I pity the person that bought it after me.  

  The 4 cylinder is weak.  All 4-cylinder engines are weak, but this one is especially obnoxious.  The stick shift helps that, but not much.  It made this annoying airplane noise when I cruised in neutral at high speeds.  I took it into the dealership over it but they said they couldn't hear it no matter what.  I didn't worry about it, but it was annoying.  A 4 cylinder is also useless for towing.  I think buying a pickup truck that you can't tow anything with is a waste of time and money.  I was able to tow a single jet ski around, but the trailer hitch scraped the bumper every time and it ended up looking awful and needed to be replaced badly.  

  I don't think I like the Tacomas.  The Pre-Runners are good little trucks, but they cost almost as much as the Tundras that are so much better.  They also cost the same as a nice Ford F-150 or Chevy Silverado.  Then if you get the stripped version and pay only half the price of the Pre-Runner, you get a useless little car that looks like a truck.  I guess they would meet the needs of some people, but not most.  I'd avoid it, especially the 2001 Tacomas with the ugly front grills.  

  It's a fairly quiet ride, and very smooth on smooth roads, but the shocks are incredibly soft so the car bounces really hard on speed bumps or any other kind of bump.  It's a rock 'n roll car.  I didn't like it.

  The tires are cheap when you get the car.  Because the tail end is so light and the tires are basically bald when they're new (they have no traction) it's really easy to spin out and fishtail if the road is wet at all.  When it rains, you can't get to second gear without spinning out no matter how slowly you release the clutch.
