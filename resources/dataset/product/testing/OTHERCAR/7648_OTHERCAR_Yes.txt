            When I saw the new 2002 Ford Explorers, I fell in love.  I really liked the look of the new models.  When my wife and I decided to trade in our F150 pickup truck for a sport ute, the Explorer is what we wanted.  We soon realized that Ford is very proud of the new Explorers, and we started looking at used 2001's.

That was when a friend put us in touch with his buddy who is a salesman at the local Lincoln Mercury dealership.  I met with him several times and looked at 2001 Mountaineers.  I just couldn't convince myself that it was the vehicle that I wanted.  Then one day, he called me to let me know that they had received 3 2002 Mountaineers with very slight hail damage.  At first I resisted, because even at a reduced price, I still was hesitant to spend $28,000 on this vehicle.  Then one day I stopped in and took at look at it.

I fell in love.

This is a beautiful vehicle.  Although I still like the looks of the front end of the Explorer better, the interior of the Mountaineer is much better, and the vehicle as a whole seems to have more style and class.  The one I ended up buying is black with the convenience and luxury packages.  It has leather, 6-disc CD changer, heated seats, etc. (a long list of features!).  It had about 4,000 miles on it.

This vehicle rides and drives like a dream.  The V8 gets it up to speed quickly and effortlessly, and the 5 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly.

The only complaints I have so far are that the seats seem a little flat and hard (I've never been satisfied with the seats in any car I've ever driven, by the way), and the switch for the seat heaters is difficult to find.

The back seats are great for our 8 year old and 5 year old.  They love the "way back" seat, and it easily flips down to the floor to create more cargo space.  I've found this vehicle to be very functional; whether it's commuting to work, hauling the family around, or moving furniture, it's up to the task.

The creature comforts are great.  The sound system is top notch, the automatic dual zone climate control works great - just set it and forget it.  The Message Center provides all of the information the driver may need: Miles to empty, average Miles per Gallon, trip odometer, compass, and system checks (things like low oil, washer fluid, brake fluid, etc.)

In the 2 weeks I've had it, I've loved it.  It's a great vehicle.  It has the comfort and drivability of a car, and the functionality of a truck.

The other thing I would mention is my experience at the dealership.  Maybe it was because I was dealing with a friend of a friend, but the salesman treated us great.  This is a new experience for us.  At the Ford dealerships we've visited, we've always walked away feeling like they thought we were idiots.  Not to mention the fact that they keep you there for hours on end.  When we finalized the deal, I told our salesman that we would come by to pick up the vehicle, but only had about 30 minutes to do it.  Sure enough, when we arrived, he had all of the paperwork ready.  We signed and left in our new ride in about a half hour.  It was excellent!!!  This was my first dealing with a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, so I'm not sure if they all are like this, but I certainly hope so.  It was a RARE pleasurable buying experience!

UPDATE - 4/26/2002
I've had my Mountaineer for about 3 months now.  I still love the vehicle, but wanted to update my review on the problems I've had.  After owning the truck for about 6 weeks, the cruise control stopped working.  At about the same time, the ABS warning light started coming on, and staying on.  I took it in to my dealer, and they fixed everything in one day, including giving me a complimentary oil change.  Since the service, my Mountaineer has been perfect.  I still enjoy this vehicle very much.  My only complaint, now that the weather is getting warmer, is that the fan is very loud.  When I have the climate control set on Auto, and I climb in after it's been sitting in the sun a while, that fan kicks in and it's loud!  I usually turn off the Auto so I can turn down the fan.  Other than that, I'm loving my truck!
