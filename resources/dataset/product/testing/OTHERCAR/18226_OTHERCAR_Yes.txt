            While many many people will explain what a completely wonderful car the Acura Integra GS-R is, few will speak about it's many problems. Many of these problems concerns various rattles eminating from the dash, headliner, rear hatch, etc. Also, GS-R's have a poorly designed clutch with springs that happen to break a lot, in some cases with less than 10,000 miles on the car. The drivers seat also has a tendency to become quite loose, which in my opinion that's not exactly a good thing. The paint is also horrible, that's gotta be some of the cheapest paint ever put on a car, usual honda style of course. The suspension is pitifully soft and body lean is very severe in stock form. Calling this car a sports car is like calling a yugo a luxury coupe. At best, I'd consider the GS-R to be a Sporty Coupe, but that's all. Granted, with enough modifications you can make a GS-R very, very nice, but by the time you are done with all that work you could have easily afforded an Integra Type-R, a much better car for anyone who can get over the loss of a useless sunroof and very unsporty leather. Now, this car is a blast to drive, especially after the secondaries open at 5700, the brakes are fairly good, and the suspension can be fixed. Overall, I give it 3 out of 5.
