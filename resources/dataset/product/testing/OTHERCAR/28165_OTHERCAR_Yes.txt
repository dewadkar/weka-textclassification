            The FinePix S602z seems to be a rarity among consumer digitals:  A high-resolution image with good zoom quality.

Apart from it's lovely 6x optical zoom  (don't let anyone tell you different- optical is always better than digital) giving you a versatile working area comparable to what most people shoot on an SLR, the S602z has a serious pixel output.  While it takes shots at a respectable 3+ megapixels, it has a Pixel Coupling system which gives you an effective file output of 6 megapixels with very little alteration of the image.  In well-lit conditions, I found almost no loss of image quality.  In low-lit areas requiring a flash, the coupling does seem to 'soften' the image a bit, but not to the point of making me want to throw out the shot.

The S602z also has a dizzying myriad of options available, from adjusting the effective ISO (film speed) of the picture (up to 1600 ISO which allows low-light shooting without a flash) to adjusting the brightness of the built in flash for those times when you just don't need quite as much flash in your flash, to zooming, panning, and trimming shots right on the camera. Remember, though, that a lot of features means learning a lot of features.

The S602z also comes with an electronic viewfinder as well as an LCD panel on the back, so if, like me, you're more comfortable shooting through a viewfinder, you're set.  

The camera has optional lens attachments- a wide-angle and 2x teleconverter (attachments require a converter) to further increase the versatility.

Its only real drawback is that it has a high power demand, so keep those batteries charging, and carry a couple of spare sets.
