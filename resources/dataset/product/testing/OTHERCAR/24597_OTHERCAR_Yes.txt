            I purchased this car almost 2 years ago with about 125k miles on it.  The guy I bought it from informed me that it did burn a little oil but besides that it had been an excellent car that he did religious maintenance on and used mainly on the highway as he traveled a lot for his job.  As soon I drove it I knew it would be my next car.  I was on a limited budget and the seller practically gave it away since he got a good deal on his VW Passat he bought to replace it.

The car now has 152k miles and is still running like a champ.  It continues to be an oil guzzler but otherwise runs beautifully.  I try to combat the oil problem by using higher grade gasoline when possible (amazingly this helps) and trying to keep the gas tank at least half full at all times (which I've heard is a good idea for any car).  I also do regular oil changes which helps to slow the oil consumption.  The oil burning is the only major issue I've had with the car and I figure it's a small price to pay for the overall incredibly reliable vehicle.  Plus it forces me to stay on top of maintaining and checking the car's vital signs.

The only repairs I've made are replacing a plugged PCV valve (75 bucks) and some hoses ($150) and I'm just now replacing the radiator which shouldn't run more than a couple hundred!  The clutch and transmission are in great shape and my mechanic always comments on how well the mechanics seem to be working.  I've never needed to do anything to the brakes (the car is so light it hardly wears them down).

Sure there are some not so spectacular things about this car, such as the lack of roominess and relatively uncomfortable seats (which is mainly noticeable on longer trips).  Also the vinyl seats are cracked and peeling but I have seat covers to help with that.  Another pain is the automatic seat belt on the front passenger side.  I also wish it had intermittent wipers and A/C, put you can't be too picky with a car like this.

It is very good at holding up against rust, unlike some of the older model toyotas.  It does have very basic features, but they are designed well and I have had almost no problems with them other than some minor electrical shorts.

The car does have trouble getting up to speed on the highway at times as well as up hills, but I found the high grade gas helps give optimal performance (and it makes the tank last longer too!).  It can have a bit of spunk to it at times also, especially when driving around town, helped by the fact that is a very light car, which can also make it a bit noisy on the highway.  I put in my own stereo system which is a necessary improvement as far as I'm concerned and it sounds great due to the small interior.

Overall, this car is the most reliable peppy little thing around.  Toyota engineered these thing perfectly as far as I'm concerned.  They made everything just right for the size.  They really know how to make long lasting engines and if you treat it right these things can go over 300k miles.  I'm hoping to get near there myself unless I decide I can actually afford, or even need, to upgrade to a bigger or faster vehicle.  But at this point it gets great gas mileage and suits me just fine.

***The most important thing I would recommend with this car is to upgrade the tires.  The car comes with tires that should be meant for bicycles only (the 155 width)!  I would recommend getting at least 175 width or higher (some mechanics may not want to put the wider tires on so find one that is willing to do so).  The wider tires greatly improve the car's handling.  Without them it feels like the car might tip over if you take as sharp turns as I do. 

I recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an excellent economical commuter car or young students on the go.  I'm planning on giving an update when it nears 200k miles.  Go Go Tercelly!
