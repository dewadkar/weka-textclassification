                          I have a family of 5. We have looked every where for the best ride to suit us. Well I have found it in my SideKick.

              I live in the country, So we needed 4 wheel drive
With 3 kids we needed a 4 door.I did not want something to big,
Because of the gas prices

              My SideKick, fits all of what I wanted..my kids, the price,4x4, and the view is great.I did not know how many blind spots I had in my car untill I got my sidekick.

               They only thing I do not like is there 2 door.
I have been told by to many that they do flip.

             Hello Again
I am back here to update you on my SideKick seens I have had it for 6 months now. I still LOVE IT! 

              These gas prices are killing everyone, But me LOL, I get anywhere from 30 to 35 miles to the gallon.

               I took my SideKick mudding for the first time last weekend.I had a blast! Let me tell you it is not like a big CHEVY TRUCK
or anything but it was fun. I believe that the light weight of the SideKick does not allow it to go through big massive mud holes,But if it did then I would be paying the price in gas right now.

                My only problem with it is.
the back seat,I being very tall person have to but back my seat ALL THE WAY! There for it takes the space from my children in the back seat.
So if anyone knows how I can move there back seat back more let me know.

                     WAIT STOP THE PRESS.
       There is one more thing.I told you I had three children.
        So there for when we are all in the SideKick.
          THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SEAT BELTS.

                  &quot;&quot;&quot;THERE IS ONLY 2 IN THE BACK SEAT&quot;&quot;&quot; <br><br>
