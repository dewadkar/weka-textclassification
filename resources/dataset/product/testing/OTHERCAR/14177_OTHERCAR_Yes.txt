            My husband and I purchased the 2000 Voyager a week before our son was born.  It has been a life saver carting around a newborn.  We have already gone on three overnite trips with our baby and couldn't be happier with our vehicle.  It handles like a car and we haven't had a single repair needed.  We got the model with the V8 engine, which is great for highway driving, but not so great on gas consumption.  My only complaint would be the wind noise that comes from poor fitting of the window glass against the rubber molding.  The back seat comes out easily, but it is very heavy.  Two people are needed to carry it.  The extra outlet in the back is also quite handy.<br><br>
