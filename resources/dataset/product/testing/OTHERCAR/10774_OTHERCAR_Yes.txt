            After comparing nearly all the 4-door, 4X4 SUV's available, the suburban seemed to be the best overall bargain.  Much more cargo space for very competitive price compared to Yukon, Tahoe, Expedition, Explorer, and Navigator.  Major drawback is gas mileage.  Comes with two engine sizes and the smaller is more than adequate for everything except the heaviest tow loads even uphill.  The tow pckg. includes a transmission cooling system and beefier suspension.  The luxury pckg. includes heated front seats, leather, special shocks, and heated outside mirrors to prevent icing/fogging.  Good points are GREAT visibility, very strong power/acceleration, gobs of cargo space, steering controls that stiffen with increasing speed to stabilize at highway speeds, and the AM/FM/cassette/CD automatically adjusts its own volume to the ambient noise with increased speed--meaning you don't have to turn up the volume on the highway, it sounds the same regardless of the speed you drive.  One possible area of concern is that many of the reviews I read warned of brakes wearing out around 30K miles.  Most come with running boards now so a stepladder is not needed for the 4X4 suspension.  Overall a refined towing vehicle with capacity.  More nimble and flashy vehicles abound, but compromise the practical aspect for a family with a trailer.<br><br>
