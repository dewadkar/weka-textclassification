            THIS IS MY SECOND VW.
I was originally shopping for an Audi A4 when I bought my first New Beetle in 1999. After the VW salesman promised me a 30-day 100% buyback guarantee, I took him up on it, and purchased a 1999 New Beetle 2L gas.  It was my first Volkswagen, and a very positive driving experience.  After two years of excellent experiences, I have now traded up to a second New Beetle, this time a 1.8L Turbo model, and I am even more pleased with my choice.

MY DRIVING HABITS.
I am a regular commuter and a confessed yuppie.  I am in and out of my vehicle up to 20 times a day when doing consulting and client meetings.  The ergonomic details of entry-egress, seat height, steering wheel height, head clearance, and driver-friendliness are very important to me.

Furthermore, I drive "briskly" and crave a nimble car that is agile-yet-commanding in traffic.

THE BEETLE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
This is a car with tremendous personality and a surprising level of engineering quality.  Not only does the Beetle cut a silhouette like no other car, it is also a very carefully designed with meticulous attention to driver detail.

1. The seating position and driver perspective of the road is tremendous.  Adjustable seat height, lumbar and side support, taller line-of-sight, and good visibility make this a high-grade positioning for a 5'5" to 6'3" driver.

2. Amazing horsepower in this peppy little 1.8L turbo.  When driven above 4000rpm, this car will lunge forward like a Jack Russel Terrier after a frisbee!  I have shocked several mustang, 300-series beemer, and Japanese-model drivers with my car.  

**Techno trivia for you: Although the official VW dynometer states 150bhp, the Great Secret of New Beetle 1.8 Turbos is that they really deliver 183 bhp.  The higher-end Turbo "S" Beetles push 200 bhp. Beetle owners who choose to dyno their cars are often pleasantly surprised to discover this.  

3. The driving itself is good-to-excellent.  Stock suspension doesn't lend itself to aggressive chicane moves, and the road feel isn't as positive as I would like, but the Beetle is still a tremendously-nimble and agile vehicle in stock form.  Aggressive drivers who want a distinctive car should seriously consider investing in a Turbo S Beetle, and modding it with suspension and chip upgrades.  

4. Fun Factor!  Not only is the Beetle a great choice for a sporty commuting car, it is also an emotional and playful statement to the people around you.  Often called "The Pod" of cars, the NB even mimics a bubble-shaped craft.  People who like this look also love this look.

DOWNSIDES

1. The trunk can fit only two stuffed gym bags.  Camping requires the rear seat to fold down.

2. Service can be really inconsistent, especially around parts of the USA.  VW Canada is particularily disciplined in performing warranty service, but I have heard horror stories of VW dealerships being rude and inconsiderate to their Beetle owners in America.

3. Third and fourth passengers need to be short people.  The rear seat is not for adults over 5'4".  I would not put anyone taller than that in the back for more than 10 minutes.

OVERALL
I absolutely enjoy driving my "brisk little pod". It is one of two cars in my family, and since we have no young children nor do we need to haul soccer teams about, then the Beetle is a practical and pleasant choice for commuting.  I highly recommend this sporty and surprisingly-powerful little vehicle to anyone who shares my driving habits and who enjoys the silhouette of the NB.


4.5 stars out of 5 for the price.
