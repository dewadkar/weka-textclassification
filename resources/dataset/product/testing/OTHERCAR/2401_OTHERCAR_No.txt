            I purchased the camera in February 2000 to use at my sons wedding in May, but we had to send it off to be repaired in early May and didn't get it back until the end of June. It would have been nice to have some great digital pictures of our vacation trip in August but by then it was headed back to the shop and I didn't get it back until October. Christmas pictures of the grand kids would have been nice too, but on December 8th it was back to the shop. Around the end of January we received a new (reconditoned) camera from Toshiba. We have been treating it as if it was a bottle of nitroglycerin, very carefully, and it has been working pretty good up until last week. Now we are unable to download the pictures from the camera! When the camera is working it takes very nice photos as long as you hold it very still, a slight movement and you will have a blurry picture. The camera body is very fragile. The rubberized hinge for the flap that covers the charging port came apart after about six months, the charger had to be replaced after six months also, the lens cap won't stay in place and I've taken the carrying strap off because it has come undone twice and I have almost dropped the camera. (the strap is too narrow). I purchased this camera because of some of these features, it seemed so delicate, so well made, I guess I expected too much from a $800 camera.
