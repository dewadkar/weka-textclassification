            I purchased my 2000 Chevy Malibu in September 1999.  I had shopped around considerably in my quest for a safe, reliable, larger car.  It came down to a 1999 Saturn or the 2000 Chevy Malibu.  For the SAME price as a 1999 Saturn I picked up my Malibu....I got more car!  The Malibu comes standard w/ a V-6 engine and air condition.  Not to mention the built-in child safety seat anchors.

I LOVE that the car came with TWO cup holders...on in the center console and on the driver's side, LIGHTED visor mirrors and a stereo system in which the volume adjusts to the speed of the car.

I didn't pay anything extra for the scotchgard on the upholstery, which would've been well worth the money spent when blood got on my seats.

I have a 10 month old baby boy and his safety was of utmost importance to me.  I feel very safe and secure in my Malibu.  Plus, it handles well in the snow and rain!<br><br>
