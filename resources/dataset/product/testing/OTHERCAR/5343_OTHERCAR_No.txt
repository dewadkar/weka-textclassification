            Update:  Since writing this opinion, the transmission died at 84,000 miles.  We were visiting relatives in Pennsylvania over the Christmas break.  On Dec 30, the transmission began acting up.  At first, the engine sputtered while stopped for a traffic light.  Within about 50 miles, the van quite running completely.  We had it towed to the dealership where we purchased it on the day of New Year's eve, where the mechanics began working on it immediately.  The diagnosis was the transmission and luckily, they had one in stock.  The following Monday, Jan 3, the repairs were finished.  Turns out they had to replace the transmission twice.  The first one they installed made noises when they test drove it, they had pulled it out and replaced it with another.  The total bill would have been $1800, but the owner of the dealership called the Chrysler rep and asked if Chrysler would cover any of the cost of the repair.  Fortunately for us, Chrysler agreed to pay for the parts.  Our final cost was only the labor, which came to just under $300.  Obviously, we were happy with this arrangement, but we had inside help.  My brother-in-law is the general manager for another dealership owned by the Dodge dealer.  I'm sure we wouldn't have received the same treatment had we called Chrysler ourselves.

In 1996, my wife &amp; I purchased a new 96 Grand Voyager LS.  We bought most of the options: dual sliding doors, rear AC, 3.3 V6, towing package, power everything, tinted windows.  We were reluctant to buy the van because I had previously purchased a new 85 Dodge Daytona which turned out to be a real lemon.  We had hoped that in the 11 years since, Chrysler had tackled its reliability problems.  That turned out to be extremely optimistic.

Our problems began when the van was less than 1 year old.  It would sputter and die while driving down the highway.  After several trips to the dealership, the computer was replaced.  Six months later, the problem resurfaced.  The most disturbing aspect of the problem was the suddeness of the onset.  On one occasion, we were driving along I-95 north of Wash, DC at about 65 mph during rush hour.  There was a slowdown ahead, so I applied moderate pressure to the brakes, without warning, the engine died, as if I turned off the ignition.  I was in the middle lane of heavy traffic, without steering or power brakes, by now traveling along at about 45mph.  I immediately put the van in neutral and tried to restart the engine.  It turned over just fine and seemed to start, but it died again instantly.  Fortunately, there was a gap in traffic just large enough for me to steer off to the side and coast to a stop.  After about 5 minutes, I restarted the van and was able to resume our trip.  Another incident occurred just as I was turning a corner.  I was halfway through the turn when the engine died.  Without steering, I nearly drove the van into a ditch.  Again, after several minutes, I was able to restart the van.

Chrysler was never able to fix the problem.  And that wasn't the only fault with the van.  In 3 years, it has been repaired numerous times: a new computer, new water pump, new steering column, three new batteries, new rear drums/cylinders, new turn signal stalk, new gas tank, new fuel pump and a new starter.  Five times we had to have it towed to a garage because it wouldn't start.

If we were alone in our problems, I would be willing to accept that maybe we bought one of the few lemons.  But I have learned of far too many other people having problems with their vans.  

Our next family car will most certainly be a Japanese import.  We have owned two and never had any problems.<br><br>
