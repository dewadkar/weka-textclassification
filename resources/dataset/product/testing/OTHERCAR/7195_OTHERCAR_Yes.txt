            When I first bought this car used back in March of 1998 it had 42,000 mile on it.  Currently (Aug 2001) it has 112,000 miles.  The only major problem I had with it so far is the fuel pump had to be replaced.  Meanwhile, the only minor problem I am having currently is that the brakes tend to squeal a lot.  Other than those two issues, this car is fabulous!
I have the basic GXE and I love it!  I purchased it as an off-lease vehicle and made sure to get whatever maintenance records they had at the dealership to make sure that it had been serviced regularly.  If you can get this information, it'll really help put your mind at ease about the history of your purchase.
Outside the car is crisp, clean and nice looking for a four door sedan.  The trunk is pretty big and there is a backseat pass-through.  I would have liked the backseats to fold down but I think they do that now in the new models.
The interior is great.  The front seats are very supportive even for long trips although it is nice to get out and stretch every once in awhile.  The backseat passengers have plenty of leg room.  The dash is layed out well and everything is within easy reach.  
Under the hood is one of the best engines in it's group.  I think it has even won some awards (J.D. Power?).  It has great pick-up for those passing situations or if you just want to leave the line in a hurry!  
Overall I'd definately think about getting another Maxima in the future when I decide to retire this one, but I think this one still has plenty in it!!!  Don't overlook this car when shopping!
