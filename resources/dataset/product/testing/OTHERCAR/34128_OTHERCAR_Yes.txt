            Well, I must say, without a doubt, this is the nicest car I've owned.  I bought the car over several other choices, both more and less expensive, but couldn't pass up the 240.  It's an absolute blast to drive, comfortable yet quick and agile.  The ergonomics are very well laid out in the interior, and there's plenty of legroom for me, and I'm 6-4;however, I pity those who are in the back seat.  BUT, if you're anything like me, Those in the back seat will be fine, a little lack of legroom never hurt anybody....  

Seeing as how I bought the car about 12 hours ago, I can't comment on reliability just yet.  Fit and finish are excellent, the paint is not peeling or cracking anywhere,  and the rims are new-looking.  I would recommend this car to anyone who want's to enjoy what they drive, and want performance and style with a comfortable well-built car... Ok, so I guess that's about everyone, but hey, it's great.  There. I'm done.<br><br>
