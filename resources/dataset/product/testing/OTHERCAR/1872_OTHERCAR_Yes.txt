            The first car I ever bought was a grand am. It was brand new when I bought it in 1992. It was a four door, SE with the turbo. The back seats have a feature where you can pull the backseat down for access into the trunk. This came in handy when we were on trips and even a few times when I locked the keys in the trunk on accident. You can pull the backseats down and haul things that require extra space too. The car got pretty good gas milage, approximately 25 miles per gallon in the city. This car lasted many years and was a good buy.<br><br>
