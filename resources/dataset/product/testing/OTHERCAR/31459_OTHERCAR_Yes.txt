            For technical info, please refer to another review of this product by firstdefence, who did  great job detailing specs that I didn't see the need to repeat here. Instead, I will give a subjective evaluation of this camera.

I had never used a digital camera but had been wanting one for a while. We have a 2-year-old daughter and my dad said he wasn't getting enough pictures, so he got us this camera, a flash card, and a card reader for an early Christmas gift. I opened it and got it all set up without even opening the manual - yes, it's that easy and intuitive. Having never used a digital camera before, however, I did have to refer to the manual to learn what some of the features and functions do.

If I had bought a digital cam for myself, I would have preferred one with greater than 2x zoom, but it's better than nothing. When using the zoom feature, I found I do need to preview the photo using the built-in previewer, not through the lens, as viewing from the lens in zoom mode does not give an accurate view of what will actually appear in the photo. Using the preview pane is a huge drain on batteries, though, so I advise using it sparingly. However, the preview pane is very useful for scrolling through photos, choosing which ones to delete, and there are several other things you can do with the menu there.

Having three resolutions in this camera is very nice. I do use the lowest resolution for e-mail and web pictures, and even the medium resolution is wonderful for printing out  photos. 

The software is easy and intuitive. My favorite thing is that the software gives you a shortcut to a wizard from which you can automatically upload your pics to one of several free photo-sharing sites for family & friends to view. No more going to the site, logging in, trying to find your image files on your system, and doing them 3 or 5 at a time. For some reason, the physical process of uploading pics (transferring the file) seems to be faster with this than the other way, though I don't know why that would be.

I highly recommend using a flash card and card reader; downloading directly from the camera (via USB port) is very simple and quick but is also a major battery drain. I saw in another review that this model will accept rechargeable batteries - I had meant to look in my manual and see if I could use them. I have used this camera a few times in the one month I have had it and have changed batteries 3 times (4 AA per swap), which is getting expensive.

The software for this camera also works perfectly with Windows XP, which I have previously gotten.

I have not yet had photos professionally printed from my picture files. I do have a Wolf/Ritz camera, locally, that will print them directly from my flash card so I look forward to trying that.

Though, as I had mentioned, I had no prior experience with digital cameras and nothing with which to compare this one, I am very pleased with it. The price is right, too. It was a gift but I know it goes for right around $200. I think it is a wonderful camera with great features for a fairly entry-level model.
