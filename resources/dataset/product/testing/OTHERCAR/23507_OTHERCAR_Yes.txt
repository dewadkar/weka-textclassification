            I became an Audi enthusiast in 1996 when I purchased the 2.8 A4 Quattro.  After driving it through hurricanes, snow, and wet leaves, I was convinced that Audi was the only car worth owning.  When I heard that the 2000 S4 was coming out, I immediately went to my local dealership and put down a down payment.  The day it arrived, I was at the dealership waiting for them to finish prepping it so I could drive it home.  Needless to say, the drive home was extremely quick.  
When I first stepped into the S4, I immediately recognized how much it felt like the A4 on steroids.  Everything was the 
same as the A4, yet everything was also different.  I drove the car off the dealers lot and decided to give it a little test run.  It is fair to say that I had previously pushed the A4 to it's performance limits.  I am one of those Quattro Club members that puts their car on a track whenever possible.  I've run the north and east track at Pocona raceway in Penn. and Limerock in Conn.  Even in the pouring rain at Pocono, the A4 quattro never skipped a beat.  So you could imagine how excited I was to be behind the wheel of a 250HP Quattro with a stiffer suspension, 6spd, with z rated tires.  On the street, just a slight depression of the gas pedal will pull you around a turn with the confidence of an Andretti.  The biturbo really emphasizes the potential of the Quattro system.  Off the line, the S4 has the acceleration to push you into the seatback.  The turbo lag is short and predictable.  The steering is much stiffer on the S4 than the A4, and more responsive.  The S4 does not bounce and sway nearly as much as the A4 resulting in quicker turn exits.  I have had only one problem with the S4 since i got it a month age:  I live in Manhattan and the streets are filled with pot holes.  Only 2 weeks after owning my S4, and driving it as hard as i can through the concrete jungle, my left front tire grew a bubble.  I brought the car to AUDI and the service center would not take care of it.  Ultimately the tire was defective, but I had to take it to tire center, where the tire was replaced for free, but I had to pay for the labor.<br><br>
