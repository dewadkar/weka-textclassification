            <b> Size Does Matter </b>
In short, this camera has eye appeal.Size and ease of use are the two biggest advantages of this camera. The small size makes me fear that I might drop it.

<b> Comes included with MP3 Player </b>
Concerning the MP3 player - you'll need to get a MUCH bigger memory card to really use it.  

<b> Battery Life </b>
Battery life (2x AA NiMH : costs about 5x more than alkaline goes on and on) Also, the camera uses AA size NiMH rechargeable batteries - it comes with two and you can get more cheaply. You can also use standard alkalines in a pinch. The problem is, if you have used your rechargeable batteries (NiMh), and cannot recharge them using normal AA batteries is a waste as it chews them in about 2 hours.

<b> Create your own MPEG Movies </b>
The camera is able to create Mpeg short movies.

<b>Pet Peeves </b>
Having to switch-on the LCD everytime you power on the camera in still-mode.

<b> Memory Requirement </b>
Small Memory. Increased with  32MB smartmedia, since it has the MP3 capability.

<b> Zoom Features </b>
Also, there's no zoom. There's a digital zoom that simply enlarges the middle of the frame, but obviously image quality suffers when you do that. unable to zoom in 2400x1800 mode

<b> Summary of the Camera </b>
If you need a small camera that goes everywhere with you, then this is a good choice. Decent photo's and excellent build quality, and it's tiny. Features are great in contrast to size. Because of the size, but all the features are terrific. The fits in a shirt pocket, is a mp3 player, records movies.
