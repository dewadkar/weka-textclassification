            I bought my '93 ES300 used, from a couple who recently ended their lease on the vehicle. For the price I paid, I really got a great deal! A Lexus for under 12k... almost every bit the same as it was new.

So if you want an ES300, then my advice is to buy it used. The luxury features are nice, but not worth over 35k (buy a nice home theater system instead, unless you already have one).

If you wish to spend such money, the GS or LS provide more relative luxury. My guess is that if you can spend 35k on a car, then you can spend 50k on a car. Live a little! That is only my opinion though.

Anyway, the ES is basically a beafed up Camry (I also own a '99 Camry). I love my Camry though, and I love my ES even more because of all the luxury options. And not to be forgotten is the beauty of the ES300. This is about as refined a Camry will ever look.

The ride is very quiet (as you would expect), the seats are comfortable, the transmission shifts extremely smooth, the paint is beautiful, the moon roof is large, and the control panels are easy to see and adjust.

You know you're riding with Luxury when the wiper blades retract under the hood when not wiping, when the dome light slowly fades after the doors close/open, and there's little lights in every compartment you might wish to look in. These things are the difference between the Camry and Lexus. The attention to detail and refined look of luxury.

Again, buy the ES300 used, and enjoy because it's a great car that will last a long time!<br><br>
