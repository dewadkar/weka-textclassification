            I have now owned a Audi A4 Avant for about a month. I bought the 2.8 with the Triptonic gearbox. I also got the sports package and CD player. 

I am very happy with this car, it fits my needs very well. I had a VW Quantum Syncro Wagon and was looking to replace the car with a new one as I had owned the VW for 10 years and it was getting a little tired. I knew I would need a wagon again as well as 4 wheel drive. I like the extra grip where I live in Seattle for both the rain and the ski trips in the snow. Thus I looked at the Volvo, the Subaru�s and the Audi's. I felt the A4 was the right car for me as it was smaller than the Volvo and more fun to drive. It was also much nicer than the Subaru�s on several accounts. In-fact my 1987 VW was faster, handled better, and was less noisy than the Subaru Legacy GT I test drove. 

I have now driven the A4 Avant just over 2000 miles, and nothing has gone wrong. It has been perfect. The sound system has really impressed me, it is far better than I expected, the CD never skips even on very rough roads. 

The seats are very nice to sit in for long trips, but I expect the sport seats would be too small for larger people, so take care in getting the seat that works for your size. The Triptonic takes some getting use to but is a very nice system once the driver gets the hang of it. When letting the gearbox shift its self, it is the best automatic I have ever used, it adapts to your driving as the road changes. 

Could Audi improve the car, well yes in a few small ways. I would like more head room in the front seats, I am 6'-3&quot;, I would like the vent fan to be a little bit quieter, I would like to get more power (my other car is extremely fast as I use it for racing, so this is only in comparison) and I would like to get more than the 19.7 MPG that I get (I do almost no freeway driving). 

To summarize: I felt the Audi A4 Avant would be my best choice and after 30 days I believe that it is indeed the car I hoped for. I would by it again with out hesitation.
