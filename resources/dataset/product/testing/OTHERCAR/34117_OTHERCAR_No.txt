            I bought a Dodge (Shadow) vehicle because I had heard good things about it in terms of its mechanical reliability.  Little did I know that I, as well as every other buyer of the 1991 white Dodge Shadow, would be rewarded with a totally defective paint job.  You can spot my car and every other 1991 white Dodge Shadow by the classically defective peeling paint job.  Consumer reports, by the way, also noted this same defect.  How can everyone rave above their Dodge when I see many other 1991 white Dodge's out there in as sorry a condition as mine.  Every white 1991 Dodge Shadow is an eyesore to put it bluntly!  Why do I not here from the other consumers concerning our mutual rip - off by Dodge?  Why was this obvious defect not rectified by Dodge via a recall?  Would I buy another Dodge after being raked over the coals by such an unsympathetic corporate giant? The answer is - I WOULDN'T!!!  To make matters worse, I did speak with one other local Dodge owner who also reported another problem with their 1991 white Dodge Shadow that I have also experienced.  I would be interested to know if any other owners of the 1991 white Dodge Shadows have noticed a defect in their front - either driver side or passenger side panels in terms of a bowing defect of the metal body after running their cars and then parking them - only to return and be unable to open either the driver side or passenger side front door without bending the panel.  Please feel free to write me, as their is strength in numbers.  <br><br>
