            Avoid this one at all cost!!  We bought our 1993 Dodge Intrepid because of the way it drove.  It seemed to really hug the road like nothing I had ever driven.  

But, after being stranded on the freeway....and I mean numerous times...I finally traded it in for my peace of mind.  This car would &quot;shut down&quot; for no apparent reason....no matter where I was or how much in a hurry I was....

According the the &quot;magazine expert reviews&quot;, we could expect electrical problems...yep!!  We could expect fuel system problems...you bet!!  We could expect transmission problems...ahuh!!!  After being in the shop for what seemed more than my own garage....I gave up!!  

Avoid this one....life is too short for that much stress and you probably won't be able to afford the repair bills either!!<br><br>
