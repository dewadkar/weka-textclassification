            I just love this camera so much.  It takes great pictures in it's automatic mode, plus gives you the flexibility to have complete (manual) control over everything.  I don't even know what else to say, other than this camera is a must for anyone who wants to take some seriously cool digital pictures.  It's a great beginner camera, an awesome intermediate camera, and an outstanding professional camera.  Yeah, so it's only 2.1 megapixels; unless you're wanting to create posters, it more than enough.  Not only can you get great 8x10 prints from this, you can get images for your website, as well as Quicktime videos with sound.

I originally bought this camera for $799 and used it for almost a month and loved it, however, I was strapped for money at the time and decided to return it for a less expensive camera.  So, I bought an HP 618 camera which was really good, but no where near the experience I had with the Olympus.  The Olympus C2100 was the camera I compared all others too, so it made me realize how many "cheap" cameras there are on the market.  When I say "cheap", I mean price and quality.  Well, I returned the HP and tried out the Fuji Finepix 4900, which was a big step up.  It had a 7x optical zoom, but lacked the Image Stabalization and the overall quality of the Olympus.

With all this said, I decided to go back to the Olympus, which I found at Wal-Mart (of all places) for only $499.  Since then, I've taken thousands of pictures and many videos and have been completely and utterly satisfied.  I can't imagine any other camera being as good.  It even has that "fancy" look that makes it stand out.  When I pull out this camera, people automatically think I'm an experienced photographer.  Well, with this camera and all the help it provides, I am an experienced photographer.

I should get a job with Olympus because I love the products that they put out, and this camera is just another reason to buy only the best.  And at the price it's currently at, you'd better grab one before they're completely gone.
