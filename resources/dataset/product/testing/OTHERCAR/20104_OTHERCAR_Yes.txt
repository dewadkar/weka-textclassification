            Having driven this car for over three years, I must say it is my favorite car of all time (I also have/had a Viper and Acura NSX). The car is quick and comfortable on long trips. I think others have covered to positives of the car so here are the negatives:
BY FAR the biggest problem with this car is the fact that it doesn't come with a spare tire and jack. To save room, BMW gives you a small compressor that holds some "goop" to seal punctures. You also have roadside assistance (free while under warranty). This may seem like an OK idea until you need it. What should take about 15 minutes to change a flat, turned into a 4+ hour ordeal because the "goop" didn't work. After getting the car towed to the dealership, I was told the tire couldn't be repaired(?). ELEVEN days later they had the flat tire replaced! And still they forgot to recharge the "goop" in the compressor (which will cost me another $137)! I now have a great car I'm afraid to take out of the area. I'm going to buy a spare and jack. I'll have no trunk space, but... The only good part was that I was close to my home town. If I had been on vacation this would have been a total disaster. Cell phone coverage here is spotty, at best, so the roadside assistance was OK, but it took us 1/2 hour to get a ride to a phone. If we had been further out in the country, I might still be there. Give me a spare any day.
These cars tend to use oil. Mine isn't too bad so far - about one quart between oil changes.
If you have the "brushed titanium" interior trim, it is likely to peel with some sort of plastic clear coat flaking off. Mine was replaced under warranty but it's happening again. I may not bother getting it fixed again.
A little more room, especially in the back would be nice when you need to use the back seat.
