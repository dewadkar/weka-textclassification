                 Well, she's not new anymore. I bought my Kia in the summer of 1995. It was one of the best decisions I could have made for a first new car purchase. The Kia was my third car. The others (A Volkswagon Jetta, Toyota Tercel and a Ford I'd rather not remember) were all second hand and I was ready for something new, something all mine. 
     I had very few requirements: it MUST have air conditioning (Texas augusts are unbearable otherwise), It must have a decent stereo (I commute about two hours every day), and there must be room for my dog AND my fishing equipment. I was pretty skeptical when I first saw the car (they are definitely compact) but I manage to fit the dog and my fishing equipment inside by folding down one half of the backseat. 
     I bought the extended warranty on my car which more than paid for itself. Today my car has almost 150,000 miles on it. I have (knock on wood) not had to make any major repairs. I have had to replace tires as needed, get oil changed on a regular basis, and a few new belts. The most major repair my car has needed is a new clutch (about six months ago). I can replace all four tires on my car, balancing, etc for about $150.00. (I have spent less when tires were on sale.) In the past 4 years, I have spent a total of less than $1000.00 on car repairs. 
     I get great gas mileage. The car is comfortable for two people and my large dog or four people. 
     I was pretty impressed that when I first bought my car, KIA sent out questionnaires about every six months for two years. I wouldn't trade my car for anything. 
     HOWEVER, there are two things I would like to change. The drink holder is located between the front seats at the back of the middle console. It is very inconvenient and makes drinks easy to spill and there is only one.  Sometimes the seatbelt straps stick. I don't think it is dangerous, but it is irritating. These are incredibly nit-picky which I guess proves how much I like my car, even four years later.  <br><br>
