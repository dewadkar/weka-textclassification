            I apologize for the title, but that was basically my father's reaction when he realized what the rental company would be giving us for our trip to Atanta. See, the funny thing about our car rental agency was, they never told us exactly what they would give us. They said "It will be <i>like</i> a Plymouth Breeze". Of course, idiots that we are, when we heard this we were thinking "OK, that means I'll be getting a Plymouth Breeze."

And of course, knowing the long, extensive reputation that Korea has in the US for making high-quality cars (<i>sarcasm intended</i>), my parents were more than a little surprised and disappointed to see that the Kia name annointed the grill of our cross-country chariot. But, as they say, <i>c'est la vie</i>, or something like that. It wasn't like we'd be spending the rest of our lives with the thing, only a week. And who knows, maybe we'd even come to like it.

<i><b>The first thing to know about Atlanta is that people are friendly and helpful in person but tend to be just a tad bit different on the road.</b></i> Stand on the street for five minutes looking lost and a friendly Atlantan is very likely to come up and ask in a friendly southern drawl, "Y'all need help?". Sit in the left lane of urban expressway Route 85 for more than 5-10 seconds looking lost and a friendly Atlantan is very likely to close to within half a car length or so and ask using friendly hand gestures if you're able to move over right f#$king now under your own power or do you need him or her assist you with the front bumper of their car. Before I begin to receive plenty of friendly emails from Atlantans telling me exactly what they think of Philadelphians, please realize that I know almost any city in the U.S. has its share of drivers like this, but the contrast between an Alantan in person and an Atlantan blasting down route 85 at 90 mph driving like a demented New Yorker was too funy for me not to comment on. To make matters worse, it seemed like <i>the lack</i> of a cell phone is a ticketable offense while driving in Atlanta. So how did the big Kia that could fare in these hectic traffic conditions?

<b><i>The answer is quite well, as long as we did not need to accelerate.</i></b> When I revved the engine in our driveway and I heard what sounded like someone blowing on a kazoo from underneath the hood, I knew this car wouldn't be much fun on the highway. I was right. When you press down on the gas pedal, here is the normal sequence of events. From a stand still, nothing happens. There is no low end torque whatsoever. Try all day long, and you will not get this 4 cylinder equipped car to chirp its tires even a little. At medium and high speeds, floor the accelerator, for instance to get out of the way of a friendly Atlantan, and...nothing happens. At least for the first 3-5 seconds. Then the revs start to climb at a glacial pace until the message gets through the cobwebs to the automatic transmission that a burst of speed is needed. Then the transmission downshifts to second and the tachometer spins to around 4 thousand rpm as the engine howls in a ferocious manner appropriate for any sports car. Finally, in as little as another 3-5 seconds after all this racket begins, the car actually starts to increase speed and inch forward ever so slowly. By the time you've hit 6000 rpm you actually feel like you could merge without being rear ended, hopefully before the engine explodes. So that's all she wrote for acceleration. Sadly enough, good fuel economy wasn't even a trade-off, as we never seemed to do better than 25 mpg. Weighed down with luggage and propelled by lead feet, I guess you can't really expect much better when you have to keep the pedal buried to get through traffic. If I were to buy this car, which is highly unlikely unless I suffer a sudden bout of insanity, it would have to be with a V6, a 5 speed manual, or both. 

<b><i>Ride and handling were actually quite good.</i></b> Body motions were taught and well controlled in tight turns and the  Hankook tires(I know, I never heard of them either and would like to see a name I recognize on my tires, but they seemed alright) clung to the road well in tight turns and quick u-turns that became necessary whenever we noticed we were headed in the completely wrong direction. Ride quality was quite good. Not cushy, not jarring, just taught and devoid of unnecessary bounding or leaping over ruts and bumps. The car tracked straight down the highway. The steering was a bit annoying though. It went from being almost completely devoid of all effort and feel to being very heavy, right at about 15 mph. A more progressive increase in weight would have been appreciated. Brake feel was firm and progressive, but stops were a bit long. Only lots of large bumps closer together penetrated the cabin, and even then they were well damped. Wind and road noise were noticeable though, as well as loud growling from that beastly 2.4 liter 4-banger, whose bark seemed to have been louder than its bite. 

<b><i>Inside the car,</i></b> the first thing I noticed was the spaciousness, both front and rear. I've ridden in a Jaguar, Camrys, Accords, and various other mid-sized cars, and this Kia was right up there in terms of stretch-out room. Front and rear legroom were plentiful. There was an abundance of toe, hip, and head room for rear passengers. Dashboard plastics were cheap and hard but assembled with meticulous detail. The trunk was absolutely cavernous, easily swallowing a week's worth of luggage for four plus a cooler with snacks for the road along with souvenirs. Its hinges were designed so they don't intrude on cargo space or crush fragile things like groceries. Seat comfort was where the ball was really dropped.

The front seats were very supportive, but much too firm. The driver's seat offered enough manual adjustments that it was practically impossible not to find a comfortable driving position. Both the seat bottom and the seat back were adjustable for angle, in addition to the inflatable lumbar support and height adjustment. An interesting note: My lower back was aching after just an hour and a half with the lumbar support inflated, but with the lower seat back left flat I could drive for much longer in comfort. I think the lumbar support would have been perfect had the bulge been just a couple inches lower. However, as it was, the very base of my spine was just a few inches too low to benefit from it, so I felt more comfortable driving with it deflated.

Controls were clearly marked and mostly easy to use. The stereo was a pleasant surprise, offering strong bass and better sound than I normally expect in this class. At fist glance, it seems like the whole hub of the steering wheel is the horn button, which is the best way to go. But I soon found out when cut off by a weaving soccer mom in an SUV that the button is actually maybe about 2-3 inches across and is hidden somewhere underneath that wide expanse of plastic on the wheel, making it very difficult to find in a panic. I say either make the whole hub the button or at least have the horn clearly marked in the center of the wheel or on the spokes. I was angrily slapping middle of the wheel like an idiot until I found the sweet spot right in the center, and I hit the rapidly disappearing shape of her vehicle with a blast of Kia fury I'm sure she won't soon forget as she became a small dot on the horizon. I am sure she was quite impressed. 

The air conditioning was weak and slow to cool the interior. It took awhile to get cold and even at full blast was not as cold as we would have liked. If any car makers out there are listening, I firmly believe engineers and designers should be required to drive prototypes across country and go extra slow through desert areas. I get the feeling if this happened they would suddenly come to realize how extremely important good AC and comfy seats are, and seat comfort and air conditioning systems would improve throughout the industry.

A center console served as an armrest for both seats and also offered a small storage area that included two cup-holders. They were sturdy enough to hold two soda cans without the risk of a spill, but not adjustable for anything bigger, so forget the 711 big gulps. 

Rear seat passengers are treated to an abundance of head, leg, hip, and toe room that is excellent for 2 and acceptable for three. A center rear head-rest protects the middle passenger from whiplash. When there is no passenger it's removable for improved visibility when backing up. There is also a trunk pass-through, which made access to drinks and snacks while the car was moving a snap and made stops less necessary. This is an option sure to be a favorite of those pscho dads out there who hate to stop because they've gotta make good time even though you can't really be late for a vacation. The center of the seat back folded down to become another console/armrest similar to the one in front with another two cup-holders. It greatly added to rear seat passenger comfort and convenience.

<b><i>Overall,</i></b> I would call it an OK car. It had a very good equipment level and seemed to be pretty well constructed. The de-contenting that made it possible to offer a car this big at a price this good took place under the hood and in the choice of interior plastics and other materials. Like the Chevy Malibu, what makes it so attractive to some is the space and equipment levels available for under 20 thousand dollars, especially in a market where that's what most mid-sized sedans will run you with just one or two options. If cheap, hard plastics and having to put the accelerator through the floor to merge are worth it to get a bigger car with more options at a smaller price, go for it. Otherwise, a slightly used V-6 Camry or Accord just off a lease can be a very good deal.
