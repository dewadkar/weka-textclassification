            My plant recently settled on the Sony FD92 Digital Camera for our plant to use.  Although against my better judgement, it turned out to be an okay purchase.  Whereas it doesn't meet my own standards, it does just fine for what it is needed for.  

<b>They wanted the one with the floppy disks</b>
I had to get a new camera for my job.  Of course, they put me in charge of choosing the right one.  I settled on the Kodak DC4800.  This was a 3.1 MegaPixel camera with a lot of optical and digital zoom.  It had a 16 MB memory and had a number of options of connectivity (serial, USB, etc.). It was truly first class - the Cadillac Escalade of Digital Cameras.  

But my co-workers didn't want that one.  They wanted the Sony FD92 - only because it has floppy disks.  It doesn't come close to having the resolution that the DC4800 has.  It only has 1.5 MB.  It its significantly larger and heavier than the DC4800.  This was definately not in the same class - it was a Honda CRV of Digital cameras.  

<b>Make due</b>
So I had to suck it up and go with the compromise.  But this camera has been okay.  It takes surprisingly sharp photos of high quality.  It has a really good optical zoom feature as well.  I was able to take a clear photo of one of our pumps from 40 feet above.  This is important when documenting damage in any of our industrial equipment - cracks, leaks, misalignments, etc.  I still hold that the DC4800 is a better camera, but the Sony has been no slouch.

<b>Great Features</b>
The Sony is relatively easy to use.  It has a simple interface and is easy to navigate.  You just switch between Still mode (for taking pictures) and Play mode (for viewing your photos).  There's also a Recording mode for short (and I mean *short* movies) but I don't use that much.  There are a couple of other nice features like being able to include the time on the photo.  This is good for documenting our photos.  What is probably the best feature is the ability to switch between resolutions.  This will allow you to better manage your disk memory as well as take the sharpest photos when you need them.

<b>The floppies aren't that great</b>
Although many people find them very convenient, I find that the floppy disks add an element of uncertainty in taking photos.  Most prominently, floppy disks break very easily.  I would hate to have a disk break on me before I was able to download it onto my computer.  Furthermore, floppies are slower to access than a built-in memory.  They also make the camera that much heavier and expensive.  The camera does come with a memory stick option - but for additional money.  An 8 MB memory stick would be really helpful, I think.  It just doesn't fit into our budget for this camera.  

<b>Could have gotten a cheaper camera</b>
If all we were going to get was a 1.5 MB digital camera, we could have spent half the money.  The Sony FD92 cost us $579.  The DC800 was $599.  The extra $20 would have given us a technically superior camera.  The main cost factor for the Sony is the floppy drive.  But as I stated before, I don't see much of a benefit.  You still have to use a computer to process you photos.  Why would you spend twice as much money just because you're uncomfortable using a USB cable?  Doesn't make much sense to me.


But all things come out well in the end don't they?
