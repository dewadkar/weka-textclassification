            I love to try new products, especially if they're well-priced, and often put myself in the position of commercial guinea pig.  In keeping with that tradition, I owned one of the first Hyundais ever made back in May of 1986 - the 4-Door Excel sedan.  In the 4 years I owned it, I crashed it 4 times (hey, I was young and I promise nobody got hurt! ;-) and put over 72,000 miles on it driving from Boston to Baltimore and everywhere in between.  Amazingly, that car never gave me any problems.

I waited as long as I could for the Hyundai &quot;sports car&quot; to arrive, but when I wanted a new car in 1990, the best they could do was the Scoupe and it wasn't out by the time I needed it.  Two Geo Storms and a Mitsubishi Eclipse later, I went back to Hyundai for the 1997 Tiburon FX and walked out with the sweetest car deal I've ever made.  For a hair over $250/month, I got a brand new Tiburon FX, fully loaded with power everything, cruise control, sunroof, AM/FM stereo tape deck AND CD player, cup holders, and 15&quot; alloy wheels, not to mention the super-light Porsche-designed body and the super-fast, 5-speed, 140 horsepower Mitsubishi-designed engine.

I adore this car for it's sleek looks, loaded cockpit, fast, smooth ride, excellent gas mileage, manufacturer's warranty and support, and above all, the low monthly payment!  To be honest, I can't think of a darn thing I don't like about it.  So far, it's taken me from Dallas to New Jersey and back, and all over Texas with absolutely no complaints or problems, except for the CD player going a little nuts when I spilled coffee in it - my bad, to be sure, and Hyundai replaced the whole thing for me, under warranty at no charge!

Hyundai is often, yet mistakenly perceived as a bargain basement, second-rate car manufacturer which is simply untrue.  This company makes reliable, high-quality cars at very good prices, but better than that, they truly appreciate their customers and stand behind their products.  In other words, Hyundai does business the way business should be done!<br><br>
