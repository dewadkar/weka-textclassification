            Hello Everyone:  My apologies that my review of my new Toyota is under the wrong year heading but it could be months before the 2001 heading is up and I want to tell you that Toyota continues to build a reliable, stylish product that I believe will support me and my family for years.

I purchased the CE because of just having a 1999 Dodge Neon that had power everything which ended up being totally miserable.  Getting what I did for the trade in at the Toyota Dealer was a blessing... I was willing to lose $3000 on the trade to get back into a quality vehicle like a Toyota. 

I have over 600 miles on it and the nimble feel of handling is ten times better than that bloody American designed car I had.  The only thing that I can find fault with on my CE trim level is the fact that the car is not equipped with an intermittent wiper setting.  Other than that... I am madly in love with this car and am a totally changed person since getting it. 

From 1992-1999 I had a 92 Toyota Corolla and after driving a Toyota... nothing else can compare.<br><br>
