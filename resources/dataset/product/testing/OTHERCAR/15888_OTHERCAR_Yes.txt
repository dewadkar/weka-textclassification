            The Mercedes-Benz SLK is a unique roadster, with an innovative hardtop. It can turn from coupe to convertible in about 20-25 seconds. There are 3 different models, which include the SLK230 Kompressor, the SLK320, and the new-for-2002 SLK32 AMG (my test car).  SLK is the German abbreviation for Sporty (Sportlich), Light (Leicht), and Compact (Kompakt).

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The SLK's styling is a bit quirky when stock. The optional SP1 Sport package adds AMG aerodynamic enhancements (side skirts, rear spoiler etc.), 225/45ZR17 front tires, 245/40ZR17 rear tires, and special alloy wheels. I like the muscular look of the Sport package models (optional on the 230K and 320, standard on the AMG). 

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The SLK32 AMG's supercharged V6 engine emits a smooth growl, with the addition of some supercharger whine in hard acceleration. The supercharged-4 in the 230K is a bit gruff and the supercharger whine is more prominent. The V6 model is the smoother and quieter than the other 2 engines. Otherwise, all SLK's are relatively quiet. Wind noise is a bit more noticeable though. Being that I'm a rather tall driver, there is only adequate headroom, but more than enough legroom, though. For added child safety, the windows stick up about one-half of an inch when lowered fully. I like the classy, stylish interior. The steering wheel design does look a bit strange to me though. 

<b>ENGINE</b>: The SLK comes with 3 different engine options. The 230K is powered by a 2.3-liter supercharged 4-cylinder engine that produces 192 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, and 200 lb./ft. of torque as a low 2,500 rpm. It comes standard with a 6-speed manual with an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The 320 model is powered by a 3.2-liter naturally-aspirated V6 engine, and has the same transmission options. It produces 215 horsepower at 5,700 rpm and 221 lb./ft. of torque at 3,000 rpm. Although the 320 is heavier than the 230K, the extra torque makes it noticeably quicker from a standing start. My tester, the SLK32 AMG, is powered by a supercharged version of the same V6. It produces a massive 349 horsepower at 6,100 rpm. That same engine also produces 332 lb./ft. of torque from as low as 2,300 rpm, all the way to its 6,200 rpm redline! The torque is always there. Although Mercedes' so-called "SpeedShift" shifts faster than a standard automatic, it's still an automatic. The only feature SpeedShift offers that I like is the ability to automatically downshift when it descends a hill (engine braking).  I averaged 19 mpg on the mandatory premium fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The base SLK handles very well but with a bit more body lean than usual. Strangely, I did not notice too much of a difference in handling between the Sport package model and the base model. The only noticeable difference really was less lean. The AMG model is an entirely different story. It handles as if it were on rails. Whatever AMG did to that suspension, THANK GOODNESS! The car is so entertaining to drive on twisty roads. The brakes are extremely powerful. The SLK32 AMG weighs 3,220 pounds...a bit heavy for a car this size but is still light in general. 

<b>RIDE</b>: The standard suspension is actually quite compliant despite the extremely short 94.5-inch long wheelbase. The Sport package models ride is very uncomfortable. I would not recommend the Sport package unless you plan to do some form of racing. The AMG version is strictly for enthusiasts only. 

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: All vehicles made by Mercedes-Benz are of the utmost highest quality. There was never a point in my test drive where I felt that there was some form of quality lapse or defect in the car. 

<b>VALUE</b>: Each SLK has its own personality. The SLK230 Kompressor is a fun, sporty roadster, best suited to the Sport package and 6-speed manual. The smooth, refined SLK320 is more of a touring car that is best suited to the automatic and NO Sport package. The SLK32 AMG is an extremely fast and highly understated exotic. Its ride, however, is better suited to the track rather than the street. All SLK's are worth a test drive if you have the money for them.
