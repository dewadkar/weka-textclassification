            Why buy this car????    
1) Handles like a bemer (I previously owned a 325) BUT
it is cheaper to buy, insure, maintain and from a tax standpoint.
2) If you live anywhere it snows front wheel drive a must... traction control doesnt work nearly as well.
3) Superb off the line, great highway car, handling in turns etc.
4) Sharp looking car doesnt hurt.
In summary my best car yet and I have owned more than a dozen.<br><br>
