            I was saving up my hard-earned student cash for a $450 Canon S300, when I saw this thing on AnandTech's "Hot Deals" forum, for about $150 shipped with 25% off coupon from hsn.com. Heck, I remember when the first greyscale QuickCam was $99.00- "the camera must be horrible for that price," I thought. Still, I did my research anyway- turned out the image quality on this 2.1MP thing was most impressive! I bought one immediately, as well as a generic 64MB SmartMedia card, found on pricewatch.com, for an extra $26.00 shipped (my advice to you: get 'em while they're cheap!)

As expected, the image quality was incredible for the price, easily keeping pace with my friend's older (and much costlier) Fuji MX-2400. Graininess wasn't as pronounced as with other sub-$500 cameras I've used, and the camera handles highlights on shiny surfaces very well. Color was excellent, considering some of the terrible lighting conditions I've used- the light balancing in this camera is also excellent- I shot many interior scenes with the flash off, with dead-on color, that turned out muddy or discolored on other cameras. The FinePix 2300 does seem to be a bit more sensitive to hand shake/fast movement than the MX-2400, though. These are the first photos I've taken in a long time (reason for a digicam, actually) so I'm sure there's a bit of "user factor" involved, but getting sharp close-ups with the macro lens were nigh-impossible without a nice hard surface to rest my arms on, and I had more "ghost people" than I'd normally like. Also, for what it's worth, my camera's CCD seems to have two "stuck-on white pixels" that appear in the same place every frame; while they don't affect image quality unless in very dark settings, I am still contacting Fuji about this.

The interface was a snap, the same as with earlier Fuji digicams I've tested. Control layout was excellent, in typical Fuji fashion- I cannot stress enough the importance of easy controls, and this one was top-notch- I worked with one old Ricoh that was an absolute nightmare. Fuji classifies the FinePix 2300 as an "entry-level" camera, which means no frills like movie recording or optical zoom, but means it is INCREDIBLY easy to use. I had it out of the box and had photos on my Mac within five minutes. As for the optical zoom bit, you probably know REAL photographers don't need zoom! :-) The digital zoom is pretty useless- just "chunkifies" the pixels- and I don't really feel like I'm "missing a feature" with the lack of optical zoom. The time I'd be spending zooming would be better spent taking two or three extra shots instead.

I didn't bother installing the bundled software- the camera comes with Adobe PhotoDeluxe, which is a decent little image-editing program, but pretty useless for a Photoshop/Illustrator jockey like myself. I was very happy with the camera's USB function- I simply plugged it into my Mac and it showed up as a removable device on my desktop within three seconds, from which I could just drag and drop images... much easier than using an image-transfer package.

Construction quality was pretty solid for a plastic camera- I prefer a digicam with no protruding parts, and this one fits the bill very well- nothing to catch on your jacket pocket. Along with what seems like every other owner of the FinePix 2300, I had issues with the glass lens "window;" namely, that it would be scratched somehow. For whatever reason, it's flush against the surface of the camera- even if it turns out to be hard to scratch, I think it would be psychologically reassuring if it were inset as little as 1-2mm. But that's a minor complaint, given this thing's amazing image quality for the price. (I also got a free slipcase, but don't tell anyone.)

This thing has image quality on par with the Canon S300 I was looking at, for one third the price. Its simplicity is a virtue- I'm spending more time taking photos than messing with settings.
