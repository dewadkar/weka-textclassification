            After many years of Honda-devotion, we're now part of the VW family. We've had a 2000 Passat Wagon for 5 weeks now and we love it, and here's why (keep in mind that we've been driving a 1990 Honda Civic hatchback for 10 years):

- Turbo rocks. The car's natural peppiness is helping me in my attempt at curtailing my turbonium indulgence.
- It has nice handles. Sure, the door handles are comfortable, but the attention to detail really shows itself in little things like the cargo-area cover's handle, which is covered by a little flap to keep riff-raff from peeking in through the handle at your stuff, and the hinged above-the-door handles, which snap up out of the way when not in use.
- After an afternoon parked in the sun, we can turn and hold the key in the driver's side door to open all the windows and let out the hot air. Turning and holding the other way closes all the windows plus the sunroof. I find myself &quot;forgetting&quot; to close windows before getting out of the car just so I can do this (though once the engine's turned off, you still have some time to close the power windows).
- Driving at night is an aesthetic experience. The panel lights are blue. The dealer told us it's for ergonomic reasons, but we suspect it's really because it looks cool.
- I like playing with the trip computer. It's entertaining: I watch my instantaneous mileage go from 12mpg uphill to 56mpg down the back of the hill. It's a competition: I try to keep average mileage as high as possible. It's informative: How far and how long was this trip?

Here are my gripes:
- The key is enormous. It feels like I've got a big rock in my pants pocket.
- The Cruise controls are clumsy. They're clustered on the turn-signal stick in such a way that (after peering around the steering wheel, drifting into a brief visit with the road shoulder, to figure out where they are) you've got to take one hand from the steering wheel to adjust it (trying it with your hands still on the wheel results in flashing your bright headlights).
- The glove compartment is big enough for the VW manual you get, but not much else. There are plenty of other compartments throughout the car for stashing maps and such, but we'd prefer to keep them all together.
- The front cup holder is terrible. It flips out at an angle, toward the passenger seat, obscuring the ashtray (which is the best place we've found for keeping change, so approaching a tollbooth with the cup holder out is a harrowing experience). It's shallow with rubber grippers inside, to keep the cups snug. Too snug, as it turns out, since we can't wrestle styrofoam coffee cups and aluminum cans from the holder without spilling and cursing. We now take 2 cups when ordering coffee; one cup stays in the holder and becomes the actual holder of the full cup.
- On our car the trim panel on the inside of the back cargo lid is loose. After a visit to the dealer, it's still loose. They've threatened to replace the whole &quot;back end,&quot; whatever that means.

I'm known to buy stuff based solely on its design, the experience it affords, its attention to detail. Now that I'm living with the car, I'm learning where that attention to detail slipped. But in spite of the gripes above, I'll repeat myself: we love it.
