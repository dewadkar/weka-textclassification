             I won't get technical on this car. Basically I use it to commute 90 km a day in total to and from work. You can't argue that it doesn't get great gas mileage. Even with expensive gas prices up here in Canuckistan I barely noticed a difference in what I was spending.

The styling still gives that new car look, which is good for a used econobox. I'm in my mid twenties though and I've had other guy's comment (mock) to me though on the street on what a small car it is. This would be the Rodney Dangerfield factor. It gets you no respect if your a guy. Yet when frequently I've pulled up to a gas station and noticed the guy in front of me filling up his Yukon/Tahoe/Suburban SUV. I fill my car up from empty, pay, then drive away while their still emptying Saudi Arabia. And I'm good for the whole week. It's a very gratifying experience if you've never had the pleasure.

One thing though, if you live near hills this thing is very underpowered. I got the 1.0 ltr. version and it's gutless. Yet my commute is flat level and I often pass BMW's and other high performance vehicles in the highway. I have no problem getting to a 120 km cruising speed.

The other problem would be the convenience factor. The twin cup holders are designed more for pop cans than your favorite Grande sized coffee. You also might find yourself jockeying for elbowroom with your passenger, yet as a commuter I don't find that much of a problem. I assume if your looking at this car you won't be using it to tour N. America in.

In short, if you hate taking the bus, take the Metro.
