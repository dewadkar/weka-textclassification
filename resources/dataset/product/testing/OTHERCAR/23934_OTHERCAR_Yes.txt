            My Jetta was 9 years old and had a ton of miles on it, not to mention that the bumper was stolen (can you believe it?!), the antenna was broken, and the paint was ruined from the couple years I lived in Florida.  In short, it was time for a new car.

I really liked the Audi A4 and thought that's what I wanted to get.  I drove one and really liked it.  Then my husband encouraged me to look at other cars so we went to Volvo, BMW, and Saab.  He suggested we go to Mercedes so I agreed although I didn't think we'd be able to afford one.  We ended up leasing an SLK which was only a few dollars more than a Saab convertible because the residual value is so high that you don't have to finance that much.

I absolutely love this car!  It's a convertible and a hard top rolled into one which is wonderful for someone living in the Northeast.  It's really quiet which is nice because we do a lot of highway driving.  It handles like you wouldn't believe - it really hugs the curves and has great pick-up.

I had to learn how to drive a stick when we got this car and I have so much fun driving it.  Even mundane tasks like going to the grocery store are fun now.

The trunk is remarkably large when the top is up for a convertible.  My husband can even fit his golf clubs in the trunk.

I used to do most of the driving since my husband gets rather aggravated by traffic, etc. but now we fight over who's going to drive because it's such a pleasure.  We even took the car on a 9-hour trip and it was very comfortable.  Usually my back aches when I sit in a car that long, but not in a Mercedes.

Check it out.  It's probably more affordable than you think and it's so much fun!!!!<br><br>
