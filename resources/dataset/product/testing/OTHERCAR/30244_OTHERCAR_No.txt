             Purchased through AOL member services.  Intended for eBay photo's, unfortunately not up to the task.  The feeble beep at exposure is hard to hear, there is no way to preview your image w/o a computer, clearing the exposures became a game of &quot;work around&quot; frustration. I had to load the PhotoWise CD's data twice....not sure why. The image manipulation program is basic, equal to the camera itself.  The focus was tried from as close as three feet, up to infinity.  It never produced a clear image, at least not for an internet auction image of any thing smaller than the proverbial breadbox. When the infinity focus images were printed, (a Chevy Van at 30 feet), any attempts to print an image larger than 2 X 3 inches were very unsatisfactory.
 The price was nice, I've seen it cheaper since I purchased it. It is probably aimed at the casual user, or teens (like mine) wanting to send a ePic to a friend. Looking back I think I would have saved up for a couple more months and purchased a more capable camera for my particular use requirements. <br><br>
