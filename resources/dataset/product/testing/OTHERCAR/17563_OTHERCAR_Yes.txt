            Bought a '03 AWD4 VUE.  The reason for this purchase was an SUV that had good room, economy, all wheel drive, dependable bullet proof engine by Opel, low maintenance, easy to drive, and a good price.  Vue has all these attributes.  I immediately felt at home in the Vue as I had been driving a Saturn SL2, to and from work.  I like the idea of the Opel engine with twin balance shafts and a chain drive for the dual overhead cams.  The VTi transmission is different but smooth as glass.  The ride is excellent with virtually no engine noise at cruise speeds.  I love the power package including the electronic compass and temperature that shows on the rear view mirror.  I also like the rear view mirror auto dim feature.  The Vue, like all new Saturns, takes time to break in.  My mileage average with half freeway and half heavy street traffic yields 24-25 MPG.  I have not taken any long open road trips but expect the mileage to be from 28-30 MPG.  The side mirrors are large and give a good view of the road.  I compare this SUV to my last SUV which was a Rodeo and our other current SUV, a Dodge Durango.  Although the Vue is light duty compared to the heavy duty Durango, most of my daily usage will be light so this is perfect.  The size is perfect; the largest of the compact SUV's.  The Saturn Dealers are a different type of car company and buying a Saturn is a positive experience.  I bought mine during the March sale which included a $2000 rebate plus a $1000 customer loyalty rebate which dropped the price of this vehicle with CD, power package, and ABS brakes to $19,460 plus tax, doc, and license.
