            Ever since I purchased this vehicle, its been nothing but a convenience for me. Whether its been on a trip the the coast or just around the corner to the local grocery store, its been a load of comfort, dependability, and safe to ride in. I really feel safe in my Tahoe. I bought my 97 Tahoe about a year after it came out. The things I like most are the smooth and comfy ride, the room it has inside, and the overall power. I personally like to be high off the ground when I drive so my Tahoe makes that perfect for me. I believe anyone who likes big trucks should defenitly purchase on of these, but it probably is mostly for those who need to pull trailers and actually use the 4-wheel drive. <br><br>
