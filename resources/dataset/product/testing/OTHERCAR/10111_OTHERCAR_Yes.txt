              We just completed the purchase of a 1996 Mercury Sable GS.  This was a program car and had relatively low mileage (35,000).  The car is metallic red with a tan cloth interior.  The retail blue book value of the car is $10,500 and we paid almost exactly that price before trade.
  We feel like we got an excellent deal.  The car is big enough for our family but yet gas mileage is good.  The 1996 models are the first in the most recent design and it shows.  The exterior of the car is sleek and professional looking and the inside has a modern look to it.  The car also has both daytime running lights and a passenger side airbag, features not found in many of the 1996 cars.
  I realize this review is premature but I hope that it gives you an idea about why we bought the car.  I'll be sure to post a follow-up as time goes on.

----Update: 4/24/2000----
It's now been 3 months and I can say that we continue to be extremely satisfied with our Sable.  Our biggest positives are the handling and drivability.  The car is so much easier to handle than our Lumina van.  It's definitely been our vehicle of choice for our frequent travels.  The one negative is that we'd like to be getting better mileage.  On the interstate we're getting about 25 mpg and in the city about 19 mpg.  Overall we've been extremely pleased with the car and happy about our purchase.
