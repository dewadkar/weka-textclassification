            I bought my '95 4runner from my mom and I swear to you, it has never had to have one part replaced or anything tuned and it runs like new. We live in Lake Tahoe, CA and in winter, this car is very good in snow and just works flawlessly! The 4runner is also very solid and keeps this throughout its life.

There are a few annoyances I am still working out. One of them being a loose bearing in the steering gear box which is clanking when I brake over rough road or ride over a dip. Another is a squeak I am still trying to find in the dash area. A major negative though is the fuel economy. Its VERY poor for the power that the engine puts out which sometimes isnt enough. I average around 16 mpgs now and we have a 150hp V6. I know some SUVS like the pathfinder that have a 245hp engine that get the same mileage. Dont let the engine sound (which sounds very cool by the way under heavy acceleration) fool you into thinking this is a power monster, cuz its not.

Its kind of scary how this vehicle has gone so long without needed any repairs. I recommend anyone who owns a 4runner though to take it in for minor fix-ups once and a while to keep it in check. I also add some oil additives to the engine to keep it in an even better condition along with fuel system cleaners (once and a while).

Next summer I am taking my 4runner to death valley with a friend for a few days for our Graduation trip. I am however going to replace a few parts (fan belts and thermostat) to be safe. 

I have no doubt this vehicle could last a good 15 years more before it needs some REAL repairs. This car definitely represents Japanese quality!<br><br>
