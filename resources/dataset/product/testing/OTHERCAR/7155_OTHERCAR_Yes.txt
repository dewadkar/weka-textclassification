            If you are looking to buy a small truck you may want to by-pass the 98 s-10 section.  These trucks are filled with glitches, apparently due to the new body style.  Our truck was back in the shop 8 time in 6 months.  There was a problem with the spark plug wire connection.  The map light was blowing fuses.  The recliner handle broke off three times.  I am not sure what is was but something wore a groove in the hub, and you do not want to experience loosing your brakes at 65 mph.  Then it really upsets you when after 2 years of ownership you are only offered $7000 for trade in (paid $16900).  On the other hand this truck has very comfortable seats, nice radio, and has with stood a two year old.  Now that the problems are through(knock on wood) I love it. <br><br>
