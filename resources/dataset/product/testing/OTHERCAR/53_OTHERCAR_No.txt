               As the happy (very happy) owner of a 1990 S Class (the year before they changed to the wedgy shape), I have fallen in love with the tight, solid feel of Mercedes vehicles.  Unbenounced to me, Mercedes has completely changed the driving dynamics of its automobiles, and in my opinion, for the worse.

My father purchased a 2000 E320 4MATIC, and I could not be more disappointed with the overall 'American' feel of the steering.  Although this is just one element of the driving experience, I always consider it the most important and characteristic facet of a car.  The Teutonic and precise feel of past Mercedes has completely been removed from this, and all other, Mercedes automobiles.  There was once a time when you actually felt like you were &quot;going somewhere&quot; while driving a Mercedes:  the steering wheel had the tactile feel that meshed perfectly with the satisfying and legendary 'clunk' of the doors.  But now, you can easily steer the car with your pinky.  This brings a tear to my eye.

This being said, the car had the potential to be one in a long line of legendary automobiles produced by the venerable nameplate.  The engine is quick, responsive, and torque-y in all situations (unlike pre-1995 Mercedes engines that did not begin to pull until after 3500 RPM, which was compounded by the fact that they started in second gear).

The ergonomics, while still somewhat staid, are evolving to a point where you do not need to take you eyes off the road in order to change the stereo settings or adjust the temperature.  The stiffness of the frame and suspension while cornering is fantastic, as it is in all Mercedes vehicles, but the stiffness is also present in the seating surfaces.  This second drawback is probably less of a matter of personal taste than the first, and I think that everyone much prefers the spring-loaded seats of cars such as pre-1991 Mercedes and current Rolls-Royces to the park bench solidity of the current Mercedes seats.  But the interior is spacious, and adequate for 5 people during medium range hauls.

The 4MATIC system is a blessing in snowy and hilly Western Pennsylvania, and if you live in a snowy locale, this option comes highly recommended.  No matter how good traction control and skid protection is, attempting to move or control such a heavy rear wheel drive automobile in slippery conditions is not fun at all.

All that being said, my father bought the 2000 E-Class for one reason and one reason only:  it looks FANTASTIC.  In my mind, there is not a better looking luxury sedan on the road, and that goes a long way in today's market.  Unfortunately, the light steering removes all joy and soul from this car, and both my father and I refuse to drive it, opting instead for one of our old favorite Mercedes, or one of our newer and equally Teutonic Audis.  The 2000 E-Class has been handed off to my mother, who, incidentally, prefers the light steering.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this car to anyone who wants to experience the typical German driving experience.  If you live in a warm weather locale, look instead to the BMW 5 Series or the Audi A6 or A8.  If you live in a snowy area, I can promise you that you will fall in love with the Audis.<br><br>
