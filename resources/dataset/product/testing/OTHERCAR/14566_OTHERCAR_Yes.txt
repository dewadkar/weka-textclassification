            We have a pair of these Mavica cameras in my department at the university where I teach. I've used them frequently to take photos on field trips, which I can then post on the web for my students to review. For this kind of purpose, the camera is terrific: instant photos that outdo the old Polaroids by a long shot. The camera uses an ordinary floppy disk to save pictures to -- very convenient! No fussing with the hardware.

Professional photographers will still be disappointed in the photo quality. The pictures are grainy and sometimes a bit fuzzy, though reducing them in size helps considerably. Further, the camera has a fixed-focus and adjusts to light automatically -- great for us amateurs, but of limited use for professionals.

Pros may still prefer film for their best quality work. For those of us who want a quick photo for a web page, to email to someone, or to paste into a letter to grandma, and don't want to fuss over focus, exposure, and hardware, the least expensive of the Mavica cameras will provide.<br><br>
