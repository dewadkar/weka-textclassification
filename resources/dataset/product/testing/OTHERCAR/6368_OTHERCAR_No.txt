            Remember the Monte Carlo SS from the late 80's? It was an unapologetic muscle car with a big, loud V-8 and decidedly masculine lines. It provided an alternative to the Pontiac Firebird and the Camaro -- all the guts, but with a somewhat more businesslike exterior. It was cool.

I rented a 2000 Monte Carlo from Hertz during a 9 day stay in the San Francisco Bay Area. This was what I got when I paid $5/day more to upgrade to a "sporty" car.

<i>Sporty</i>? This is a grandpa car, an Oldsmobile Cutlass in swoopier sheet metal. Only the unspeakable new Impala has done more injustice to a legendary model name than this imposter has done to the old Monte Carlo.

This car embodied just about everything I've come to hate about GM, ranging from the disconnected feel of the steering column to the massive body roll that accompanied any attempt to turn in to a "sporty" corner.

Don't even get me started on the anemic engine. This car was no match for the hills of San Fran's outlying areas. After a few runs between Concord and the city, I learned to leave the automatic transmission in second after leaving the vicinity of the Bay Bridge.

I'm not much of a domestic automaker fan -- I drive a Toyota. I'd love to see Detroit finally get its act together and start cranking out interesting cars again. Chrysler has been moving in the right direction, and I have hope for Ford, too. But I've resigned myself to the fact that GM is never going to put out a really <b>refined</b> car. It's just not in them. This car represents, for me, their nadir. Even as the auto industry is entering a new era of innovation, GM is not only failing to keep up -- they're going back and soiling the names of the few models that had something going for them.

Maybe new hire Robert Lutz can save them. I hope so. But I'm not holding my breath.

Don't buy this car if you're a fan of the old Monte Carlo. You'll be sorely disappointed. If you're just in the market for an American coupe, go check out the Dodge Stratus.
