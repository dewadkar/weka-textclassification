            One of the reasons my wife and I bought this car was its saftey recommendations.  We feel the car handles well and is safe in almost all conditions.  

I use the car mostly for transport of electronic equipment.  And the space is great.  I fell like I have the advantages of a minivan with the comforts of a car.

To me the most important thing was price and this was a car I could surly afford.  We have had a few problems with the bank that financed the transaction but that is not the fault of Subaru.

We will use subaru in the future again for our next car.  That is for sure.

I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a family automobile that acts like a SUV<br><br>
