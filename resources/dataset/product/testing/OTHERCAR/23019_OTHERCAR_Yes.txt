            WHY DID I BUY IT?
I bought this camera because I wanted to use it for online auctions, such as eBay. I was looking for a relatively inexpensive camera with acceptable resolution on the web. It was not my intention to use this for personal photo-taking purposes (e.g., vacations, get-togethers, etc.) I want to thank all the others who left comments in this forum as I reviewed all the feedback before deciding to purchase this particular camera. It seemed to have all the features that I was looking for. (FYI I am 40-something female.)


MY EXPERIENCE -- SO FAR
I have to admit that I received the camera only yesterday. I purchased it for a very good price from an online auction house (Onsale.com). Within minutes, I was up and running. The user guide was quite user-friendly and easy to understand and soon I was merrily snapping pictures of people, places and things. No one in my household was safe last night!(Although it was not my intention to use it for this, I was pleasantly surprised at the results.) 

After I had filled it to capacity at the highest resolution, I then concentrated on installing the accompanying software and moving the photos onto my computer. One thing I should mention here is that the software cannot be used on an Windows NT machine. However, when you try, the message comes up right away that the software is not designed for NT, so at least you do not waste your time. (In all fairness, the CD does say for Windows 95 and 98 machines, but sometimes they work on NT.) This was not a problem for me as I also have a Windows 98 machine that is networked to the NT machine, however, it might be a consideration for some. On the Windows 98 machine, the process went very smoothly. I plugged in the cable, the camera beeped in readiness, and the software guided me through the process until I could see (and play with) my photos on the computer screen. 

WHAT I LOVE AND HATE...
I am very pleased with my purchase. I particularly like the fact that you can immediately see your photos and then decide to reject or accept them on the spot. I experimented a bit with taking the same photo using the three different distance settings. I found that it is important that you set this properly as it really does impact the quality of the photos. So far, I don't hate anything about it. I guess the one small drawback is the NT problem mentioned above.

WHO SHOULD BUY IT?
I would recommend this camera for people at the amateur-end of the picture-taking scale. For instance, my regular camera is a $100 35 mm Canon Snappy. It is idiot-proof and I have no desire to have my brother-in-law's $2,000 camera. Similarly, I have no need for a professional-type digital camera. My needs are simple and straightforward. This camera would likely be shunned by someone who wants perfection. But, it suits my needs perfectly. I trained my husband and 15-year-old son on its use in about one minute. If your needs are similar to mine then you would likely be pleased with your purchase. <br><br>
