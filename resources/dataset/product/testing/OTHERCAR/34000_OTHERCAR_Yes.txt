            OVERVIEW:

The model I have is extended cab, 4 wheel drive, 6-foot bed, with the 350 "small block" V8 engine. Although it is extended cab, there are only 2 doors. 

I bought this truck used a few years ago, as a third vehicle for weekend hauling, camping, some amateur off-roading, and snowy weather driving. At the time it had just over 100,000 miles on it. Yet, the engine runs like new, burns almost no oil; all controls, features, etc work fine; and aside from a few squeeks and rattles due to the age and the mileage, this truck runs as good as a new one. From my experience, this truck was well designed and built by GM back in 1994 and it has been one of the best purchases I have ever made.

EXTERIOR:

This is a big brutish truck that sits high. Aerodynamics were not considered much in it's construction, it is kind of boxy. Well, let me back off on that just a litle bit, there is an understated black rubber air dam in the front and the grill/headlights are built relatively flat into the front, so aerodynamics are not a complete zero.

I guess my point is, this vehicle is made as a work truck, back in the days (not long ago!) when trucks were still made to look like trucks. Many of the newer models (there are some exceptions) these days are getting very "car" looking. What I like about this truck is that it is not afraid to look like a real pickup made for hard work and hard play.

The front grill and the back tailgate sport the red GMC logo proudly. Chrome bumpers front and back give this truck a more classic look.

The windows in the back (rear window and rear passenger) are tinted dark for some privacy for whatever you may stow back there.

Oversize, chrome mirrors are adjustable/can be folded in. Very good size and funtionality.

This truck is very customizable, mine has an aftermarket lighted visor over the front window that works great and looks cool. Also some body colored running boards have been added for ease of entry and exit. If you want to add all manner of things to this truck to change it's look, there is a huge variety of parts; hoods, all kinds of running boards, rails, etc that will fit this truck.

INTERIOR:

Very spacious and comfy. I have cloth seats that have held up well. The front seats are suprisingly supportive and roomy. It's like sitting in a nice comfy chair in your living room. There is no lumbar support or heated seats(come on, this is a work truck!). Head and leg room in the front is substantial.

In the back, there is a folding seat for the occasional rear passenger. Again, it is more comfortable then I thought it would be. It is perfect for little kids, but adults will be wishing for a bit more room on longer trips.
With the seat folded up, there is quite a bit of storage space behind the front seats. The rear seat is very easy to fold/unfold. 

The dashboard is a bit dated by contemporary standards, but here is what I like about it. There are no idiot lights. Temp, Battery, Oil pressure, etc are real working gauges. Controls are well placed for the driver, with the exception of the cassette player and equalizer controls  - they are a reach for the driver, since they are placed towards the middle of the dash (and this is a wide vehicle).

The sound system (4 speakers, AM/FM cassette with equalizer) is functional but not high quality sound. Power is low and dynamic range is limited. I don't really care about that, for me the crappy sound system is part of the work truck ambiance of my pickup. But if it were my daily driver I would consider aftermarket upgrades.

The switches for headlights and rear bed lights are not backlighted, so at night you have to do some feeling around for them.

The heater and AC work great. The climate controls are just a tad confusing when it comes to adjusting the vents, however. If you want to get a mix of air to your feet and to the windshield, for example, you have to hit a button and then watch a bar graph move, and then hit the button again (quick, before the graph moves too far!) to set it. 

ENGINE:

The engine in this truck is a 5.7 liter 350 V8, rated at about 220 horsepower. It has electronic fuel injection. This baby starts right up every time (okay, I maintain it meticulously, but still it has lots of miles on it and I am still amazed at how well it runs).  The previous owner must have taken good care of this truck and did oil changes, etc on schedule.  

Even with 130,000 miles, the engine still has plenty of power and does not burn oil. Of course, some day it will start to come undone, but for now I am impressed with how well it runs. Gas mileage has been great too. About 15 per gallon around town, 18 on the highway. Not bad for an old V8 that has been around the block a time or two. I added a K&N filter to help it breathe better. Other than that, it is stock.

Another thing I like about this engine (the entire engine compartment, really), is that it is easy to work on. Plenty of room under the hood, and you can pretty much get to everything without too much trouble.

DRIVING/HANDLING:

This truck rides like...you guessed it... a truck! It has a turning radius similar to that of the Queen Mary.  The ride can be a bit bouncy (which I improved with some Edelbrock Performer IAS shocks). There is plenty of body roll on sharp turns - hold on for your life! But this is not meant for the race track, and the truck-like handling is part of what I like about driving this pickup. 

It does corner pretty well, and the engine is responsive. Lots of low end torque that you would expect on a truck. Acceleration is actually pretty good.

Steering is a bit floaty and you are reminded that this is not a BMW.

Braking is average. This is a half ton truck. There are disc brakes in the front, drums (with ABS) on the rear.

The four wheel drive is controlled by a stick on the floor next to the driver. It is "shift on the fly", there is no need to leave the truck and lock any hubs. Speaking from my experience, it works great. I have never had any problems. When I shift into four "hi" for snowy driving on roads, this truck plows right through. In four "low", it can go through almost anything. Of course, I have good off-road tires so that helps. All in all, for my moderate use (I am not rock crawling at the Rubicon) the four wheel capabilities of this truck are just great.

REPAIRS:

Here are a list of things I repaired or replaced (sometimes out of necessity, sometimes just because I wanted to):

- Windshield washer motor and circuit board. This was going out on me intermittantly. I thought is was a short but could not fix it. After taking it to the dealer and paying $180 for all new parts, a year later I found out there is a recall on this problem for this model year. If you have this issue and are the original owner you should be able get this fixed for free.

- Shocks; I just wanted better ones than were on the truck when I bought it.

- K&N filter (for obvious reasons)

- Optima red top battery (because I wanted a better battery)

- Dual, high performance exhaust (needed to replace the exhaust from the cat all the way back, so figured I would upgrade while I was at it).

- Tie rod ends and various other front suspension parts (all necessary due to normal wear and tear and rust).

- New rotors on the front, and new brakes all around (normal wear and tear).


CONCLUSION:

As you can see from the modest repair list above, this truck is in great shape and in my book, it is a testament to how a well built truck can keep on going strong if it is well maintained. As with any used vehicle, when looking to buy I would recommend you have it inspected before buying it, because you never know how it was treated or what may have happened to it. But from a design and build quality standpoint, I think the '94 K1500 pickup is a great truck.
