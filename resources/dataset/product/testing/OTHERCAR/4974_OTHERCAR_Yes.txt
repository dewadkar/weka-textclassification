            I was shopping for a mid-size sedan under 30 grands.  I looked at Accords and Camrys and disliked their dull "rubbermaid" looking faces.  I was on my way to take a look at Maxima when I passed my local Hyundai dealer.  There, a black XG300 being unloaded from a semi caught my eyes.  With combination of chiseled looks and curves, it looked like no other: distinctive while looking sleek and luxurious.  I immediately asked for a test drive.  It was absolutely a blast to drive.  Smooth, sophisticated 5 speed shiftronic auto transmission with equally quiet, strong engine to boot.  Just as solidly structured as the bimmers my boss drives.  After the test drive, I was even more amazed at the value XG offered.  When I checked out Accords and Camrys with the options I wanted (leather, sunroof, and CD changer), the price rose way too high.  In comparison, when I looked at XG300 L, not only were it several grands less, but it comes loaded with many standard features.  I didn't expect to get heated seats with memory (driver's side) for the price I paid.  And when I found about Hyundai's excellent warranty on XG, my mind was set - no other car companies could  match it even with their offering of extended warranty (of course, at additional cost).  Everyone who took a ride in my XG liked the smooth, quiet ride and the roomy interior.  They can't believe it is a car from Hyundai, and neither do I - I still can't believe I bought a Hyundai!  Overall, I am really satisfied with my purchase, except for that puny sized wheels.  Anyone who writes this fine automobile off because of its brand, must be illogical, insensible, lives in a cave, or must won a lottery with too many greens to waste.  Just go for a test drive, and who knows, you might get one just like I did.
