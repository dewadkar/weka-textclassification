            My Jeep Cherokee is 5 years young and still in great shape (knock on wood).  My husband wanted a vehicle with good performance qualities, good mileage, enough room for us and 2 children, and room to move things like furniture (around town) or lots of luggage (on a trip).  He settled on the Jeep because of its reputation and great price.
This vehicle sits up some from the ground, so I can see over other cars and low walls. I will admit that the getting in and out of the vehicle took a little getting used to for me. Being a short person, I found myself falling into the Jeep a few times, but after a while I never thought about it again.
I think that this is the perfect vehicle for a young family in which the children are out of the carseat stage.  It has great visibility while traveling.  Older people who have trouble walking might find it more difficult to get in and out of the Jeep, but once they were in it, they'd think it was a fine ride.
My daughter learned to drive in my Jeep and is looking forward to the day when I move on to a new Jeep and she can inherit mine.<br><br>
