            Rodeos have always had a particular appeal to me, ever since they rolled off the production line almost a decade ago.  They are nice, average-performance, yet reliable SUV's, and it's generally a good buy for your money.  The newer Rodeos that came out in 98 are sleeker than their more top-heavy, boxy predecessors, and they are safer on the road, too.  The rounded-off aerodynamics of the new models accounts for less body roll and better gas mileage.  The mileage of the old Rodeos are rather unimpressive.  My aunt's '95 gets about 17 miles to the gallon.  That's about the same as my '87 Cherokee 4x4.  Off-road performance is no great shakes, but it'll pull you through normal, everyday situations, and ANY 4x4 Rodeo will perform better off-road and through slick on-road conditions than a 2wd high-end sport-ute.  I generally like the Rodeo, esp. with its attractive sticker price.  Maintenance is usually on the low end, and on-road performance is not bad at all.<br><br>
