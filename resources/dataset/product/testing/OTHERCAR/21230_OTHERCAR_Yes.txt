            My family grew up on American made cars!  My parents have always owned Chevy's, Dodges, Fords, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, and no one ever considered a *gasp* Japanese car!  My husband's parents both worked for GM for many years so his family was also dead set against owning foreign cars.  So neither family looked too kindly at my lease of a 1998 Corolla three years ago.

I have to say I wish I bought a Toyota a long time ago!  My Corolla was a fantastic little car and I would still have except for one fact, my husband is 6'4" and couldn't drive it without his knees hitting his chin!  So back in September 2000 we decided to see what we could do to trade it in for a Camry.  We went shopping one day and came home with a 2000 Camry LE.

The car is a beautiful silver color with just a hint of green called Lunar Mist.  The car came with alloy wheels (no hubcabs for this girl), a spoiler, and a power moon roof.  I felt so spoiled!  It is truly a sharp looking car.

The car has a 4 cylinder engine and because of this the gas mileage is fantastic.  I average 390 miles on an 18 gallon tank.  This is in stop and start rush hour type traffic twice a day, 5 days a week.  On the highway she seems to barely sip the gas. (Especially when compared to my husbands Dodge Durango that gulps it down in record time) I think this is one of the smoothest riding cars you can find in the midsize car market, I regularly drive over railroad tracks that most people have to slow down to a crawl to pass over, I slow down a little but really don't need to the car just floats over them.

There is adequate room in both the front and back seats.  I am 5'10" and my husband is 6'4" so we tend to ride with the seats all the way back and there is still room for three adults in the back seat, two is more comfortable but you can fit three.

The car came standard with both a CD and a cassette player, the speakers sound great and one of my favorite things to do is open the sunroof and crank the stereo on the highway.

The only thing I had a little problem adjusting to was the cruise control knob.  It is on the right hand side attached to the steering column and it is on the part that turns so the knob goes with the wheel making it hard to find if you are in a turn mode.  The function of the knob is a little different than I'm used to as well so it was an adjustment.  If I had to change anything on this car, I'd put the cruise control up on the wheel as buttons like most cars seem to have these days.

My Camry has good pick up for a 4 cylinder car and most of the time I'm pleased with it.  There have been a few instances where I wished it was the V6 though and when I turn this in for my next Camry I will get the V6.

All in all I am thrilled with my car!  I recommend the Camry to everyone I know.
