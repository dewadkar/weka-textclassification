            I've had an Integra Coupe since 1991 and I love it.  Back in 1991 I was a first time car buyer. I was about to start college and I needed a car for my daily commute.  My parents wanted me to get &quot;a nice, trustworthy, family-type&quot; car. I had ideas about something a little less practical, and a bit more high style: A Cheverolet Beretta in Turquoise. Now, looking back on that moment in my life, that choice makes me laugh. That was the car I wanted more then anything else.  No, I hadn't actually driven one, but I was a Jersey girl with big hair that wanted to make a statement with her car.  But when the Chevy dealership couldn't get it in that color, I figured I might as well test drive the white one they had available. (I WAS actually smart enough to get into college, I swear it!)  Well, I did fine on the highway, but decided to try a real test.  The local SOB exit that could make anyone hold on for dear life.  Let me just say that in that single moment where I almost lost control of the car, my hair would have stood up without that can of hairspray.  I drove back to the dealership in silence and told my dad that maybe we should look into some of his choices.

We did the tour of all the major American manufacturers.  Then we looked at Toyota's and Honda Accords. Throughout my eye kept peering at the sportier models. I even test drove the Honda Prelude, but the cockpit just seemed too reclined for me being all of 5' 2&quot;.  I was getting very educated on the different cars, but I just wasn't thrilled with any of them.  That was until I drove my first Integra.  I actually test drove the 4-door model first.  Back then only the coupe came with a moonroof, and only the 4-door came with automatic door locks.  I chose the moonroof and the coupe and I am very happy with that choice.

My little coupe has incredible trunk space.  I am a member of Costco, a warehouse store where nothing is in a small quantity. Once, I actually brought home a new big office chair, in the box, and all the other stuff I bought that day.  Granted, I had to use bungies to keep the trunk down, but still! 

Ok, for some this will be a con. There isn't a whole lot of room inside the car. But as a teenager, my parents LOVED that I couldn't fit an army of teens in it. It is comfortable when you are sitting in the front. I love the lumbar supports in the seats and find them quite comfortable. The back seat however is more on the firm side, but hardly anyone ever sits back there. Another possible con is that it is very low to the ground--sometimes I call it the Flintstonemobile... It may be hard for older people to get in, but even more so OUT of the car. My grandmother hates it. But my grandmother is 84.  Enough said.  I've had to put about $1000 worth of work into it about every 4 years, but that includes new batteries, tires and it lasting so long that I had to replace the timing belt.  And you know what?  It still runs beautifully and its almost 10 years old.  In fact, when my brother in law decided to get a used car last year, he ended up buying a 1992 Integra. They are just fun to drive-you feel like you are in a cockpit of a two-seater plane. Not to mention you get great gas mileage. I average 28MPG Highway and 25MPG City. If you are thinking about buying one, do it. These are good cars, and I I'd tell that to anyone.
