            What can I say... I love my 2000 Hyundai Accent.  True, I've only had it for 6 months, so cannot pretend to have really put it to the test in terms of reliability and staying power.  But it runs beautifully, feels sturdy, has some of the most attractive styling on the road, and oh what a warranty (5 years bumper-to-bumper, 10 years limited).  

When I bought it, I was trying to decide whether or not to get a used car (following a string of not-so-reliable second-hand Mazdas).  The ex-rental vehicles I tried were decent, but not special, and the $8000-$10,000 price tags for those basic-model Ford Escorts had me worried.  By contrast, the $9,500 base price on a brand new Accent was most attractive.  And the warranty was particularly heart-warming (my last Mazda blew up in rather spectacular fashion, so I was naturally risk averse).  

It's true, Hyundais don't have the name recognition (or the likely resale value) of a VW or Honda.  But I am more than happy with the car I got for my money.  And the constant compliments from friends (many of whom think it's a Jetta or Beamer from the looks) are also much appreciated.  It's also surprisingly roomy for such a narrow sedan -- it carries 4 adults in comparative comfort, though it probably wouldn't be the ideal choice for a family of five (or any family, for that matter -- it's really a car for singles or couples).  

On the downside, Hyundai did manage to send me a recall notice after I'd had the car for just 3 months.  There was apparently some small problem with the windshield wipers, but that did tend to take the gloss off the new car experience.  The service at the various Hyundai dealerships I've visited has also been less than exemplary.  But while the car stays healthy, I'm extremely pleased -- it's cute, it's stylish, it handles well, and it pleases the crowds.
