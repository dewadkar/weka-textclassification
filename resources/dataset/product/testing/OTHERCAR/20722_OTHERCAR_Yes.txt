            I for one am a big fan of all chevrolet trucks. I myself own a '98 blazer and i have to say it had been one of the best, most durable car i have ever driven, in the jeep class that is. I have had this car for about 2 1/2 years now and i have found no problems what so ever. Always running inn tip top shap and i rarley have to bring it in to get serviced. When you think about suv's you think about its performance in bad weather, especially snow. I for one go to a school thats get ridiculous snow and this car gets me through the tundra. Its got an easy way to change from  2 wheel drive right into 4 wheel drive with just a push of a button. I had a jeep cherokee laredo and its system of shifting into four weel drive you had to yank the handle and it was not a easy process. This truck also is amazing off road. I have takin this car on many dirt road to mess around a little and it has handled superbly, not problems only performance. Another thing i really like is how the console is turned a bit towards the driver so that it easier access to change the radio or air condition/heating. Speaking about the heat, i swear this car gets so warm in such a short period of time its ridiculous. I for one love it because when its cold outside, and its cold alot theses days, a nice cozy car ia what i am lookin for. Well the fact is if you are looking for a quality suv that is not to pricey take a look at a blazer, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
