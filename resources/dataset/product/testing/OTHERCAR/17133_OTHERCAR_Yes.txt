            I just entered the world of digital photography and my first camera pick was the Canon Powershot A40.  I did a lot of research before I made my selection and I think that the results paid off.  My film developing costs were getting out of hand.  I guess that&#146s the reason a lot of us go digital.  Take as many shots as we want, but only print or develop the best ones avoiding paying for shots with &#147Blurred Disease&#148,  &#147Ugly Mug Shots&#148,   the &#147Yuck, what&#146s that in your mouth?&#148 , or my personal favorite the &#147Chopped Off Head&#148 Snydrome.
Being a novice to digital photography I wanted and camera that had a gentle learning curve.  The goal was also for the digital camera to replace my 35 mm point and shot.  Since I get prints in 4x6 (or 3x5), and rarely got 5x7 prints I thought that a 2 megapixels would be just fine.  (If you plan to do a lot of cropping or get bigger prints, consider a 3 megapixel camera).  My point and shoot also had a 35-115mm zoom lens so I wanted a my digital camera to have about the same capability so I opted for a 3x optical zoom which is approximately equivalent to a 35-105mm lens on a film camera.  Tip:  If you&#146re looking for a camera with a zoom lens forget the digital numbers they give you.  The optical zoom is most important.
The A40 fit my criteria.  I had budgeted about $400 for a camera.  The Canon A40 was only $250. If you purchase it now you may be able to get it for $200-230.  
First looks:  It&#146s a 2 megapixel camera with a 3X optical zoom. The camera resembles a point and shoot and it&#146s not a pocket size camera, but I do carry it with me at all times in my purse. It weighs 8.8 oz without the batteries and the Compact Flash card (an 8 MB card is included).  It uses 4 AA batteries.  This is a nice point.  You can get rechargeable batteries to save on having to purchase batteries over and over.  But if you do get caught somewhere and need batteries it&#146s nice to know you can pop into just about anywhere and get standard AA batteries.   Take a look at the website www.powershot.com if you to take a look at the camera.  It has a viewfinder - careful thought, you will only see about 80% of what the shot will actually cover.  Keep this in mind when you compose your shots, the 1.5&#148 LCD will give you a more accurate view of your shot.  Again, knowing this it&#146s easy to compensate with your viewfinder.  In addition to the 8MB CF card also included are batteries, USB cable, A/V cable (to link directly to your TV), an extensive camera manual and software manual.
Camera Operation:  You can put the camera in Automatic mode and be quite happy there.  You can take it right out the book and be snapping photos within minutes. The shots I took in auto mode came out great.  In low light you may have to turn on the camera&#146s flash.  Sometimes in auto mode my flash didn&#146t fire so I went ahead and set the flash.  The camera is very good in low light situations. The shots I took in low light were very, very nice. The auto focus worked great.  One word here about that.  Some folks who bought the A40 when the camera first came out had problems with the auto focus.  There is a firmware fix for this at the website above.  But the problem was caught long ago and cameras made since then already were adjusted.  Unless your camera has been in inventory for quite some time you shouldn&#146t have a problem. Shutter lag is quite acceptable; I have yet to miss a shot.
Other stuff:  The camera has Program modes that can be used to adjust exposure, white balance, continuous mode, macro, snapshot and infinity modes, photo effects (B&W, sepia tones), a self timer, 3 quality/resolution modes and more.  In Manual mode the user can set the shutter speed and aperture.  This is great for a more seasoned photographer that wants to have more creative control over his/her shots.  It also has a stitch assist mode for panoramic shots.  The camera also has a movie mode with sound.  Movie clips can be 10 or 30 seconds long.  Perfect size for emailing a video clip.  In a pinch use this feature to make short voice messages.   
Picture Quality:  You won&#146t be disappointed.  I took photos in several types of settings (indoors, sunlight, low light) and the camera&#146s performance has exceeded my expectations.  The photos were sharp and the colors were realistic and evenly saturated.    The camera has been a champ in low light shots as well with the same nice results &#150 sharp, realistic and even color.  My photos were printed on an HP 7550 Photosmart photo printer.  So unless you plan on getting your pics developed by any number of digital developing services you may want to invest in a photo printer.  I&#146ve also heard good things about Canon and Epson photo printers.  But for great shots a good camera is the key and this camera is great.
