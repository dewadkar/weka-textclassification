            I am saddened to report that the Intrepid has gone to the big car lot in the sky. 21 March 2002 was the night she sacrificed hers for mine. I was on a back road in rural Central Illinois when a deer ran out in front of me and I had to swerve. When I avoided the deer, I hit a patch of gravel and spun out of control head first in to a tree. Ms Margaret was totalled and I now have a BMW.


The worst part of writing about something that you like or love is where to start! So let me start with what I do not like about my Stone White 1998 Dodge Intrepid ES aptly named Ms Margaret. I name all of my cars according to what I feel when I drive them. 

I purchased my Intrepid used from Sam Leman Van Land in Morton, Illinois. (DO NOT EVER BUY FROM SAM LEMAN ANYWHERE!) I am not unhappy with the car itself other than the mileage it gets. I find myself at the pump more often than not and putting premium Amoco fuel in Ms Margaret. I find it hard to believe that an automobile the size of the Intrepid would have such a small tank. You know I would rather spend $30 filling up every week than have to go to the station every couple of days. To my knowledge it is only a 14 or 15-gallon tank. Very disappointed with Daimler-Chrysler with this one.

Please be advised that the Intrepid is one of the most well designed vehicles in its class. A class, which I feel, is one all it�s own. 

The Intrepid is one of the most beautiful automobiles I have ever seen in my entire life. I have a passion for the auto and believe the Intrepid to be the perfect all-in-one car. Not only can you have a family of five on a long trip, you can also have five large adults in the auto as well. There is ample seating, storage and power to take five adults to Chicago for the weekend and still have room to spare!  The trunk is larger than the S-500 from Mercedes. The only thing bigger is the Cadillac Deville, Chrysler LHS and the pores on a 16 year old! 

The styling of the Intrepid is astounding and reminiscent of the original Oldsmobile Aurora (circa 1995-1999). The cab forward design gives almost seven full feet from the front of the hood to the chest of the two front occupants. This car is long and wide yet just as easily navigable as a smaller sedan. I don�t know what to classify the car under other than �Luxury�. The look is both luxurious and sporty giving almost anyone the chance to look ultra fabulous with out spending a lot of cash. People will think you spent a lot more on the car than you actually did. Additionally, you can take your clients out for lunch, in the ES or R/T, and know that you only spent $20,000-27,000. I love the compliments people give me when they get in the car! 


The interior reeks of taste and elegance. From the leather seats to the white-by-day green-by-night instrument cluster. Just be sure not to have the dials too bright or the light could blind you. Above you are a thermometer, compass, trip meter, instant and average fuel economy and my favourite: HOMELINK! If you do not know what HOMELINK is, you do not know what you are missing. Please make sure that your next auto purchase has it available! HOMELINK is an integrated garage/gate opener as well as any automated lights in your home. It is the neatest thing. I used to have three garage transmitters, now I have one! 

My roommate also thinks that my car heats up more quickly than any other automobile she has ever been inside of. I will agree with her for if you warm the car prior to leaving; you simply melt in the seats! They are like butter! I don�t know about the SE, or cars without leather, but you just feel so cozy when you sit down! It is the epitome of luxury without the cost. 

On to power, my Intrepid came with the optional 3.2 V-6. This puppy will get up and go when told to do so. On a recent test with a friend (2000 Dodge Stratus ES; 2.7 V-6) we were traveling down the highway when she decided she wanted to race me. She had her pedal to the floor and I still glided by her with ease. She wasn�t too happy. Ms Margaret will glide down the road as if it were on rails. The ride is smooth and you feel comfortable, even when facing high winds! This is the most sure-footed sedan I have ever driven. I really do love my car. 

Oh yeah, I almost forgot; the Infinity sound system. What a performer. The only drawback is that you have to replace every component if you want a new system, EVERYTHING down to the wiring harnesses. That is only if you aren�t completely satisfied with the factory sound. I do not see any reason why you would want to. The CD players are manufactured by Alpine, one of the leading names in mobile audio. 

Remember that you only look as good as you feel.
