            We bought our A4/1.8/Avante (station wagon) as a family vehicle. It came with all the accessories we wanted as standard (16&quot; mag wheels, leather seats, aircon, radio/tape, electric everything), and it is just wonderful for us.

I can't think of anything I don't like about it besides the mess that my wife allows my son to make in it. It performs well above expectation, its quiet and smooth. Its also by far the best value we could get. I suppose there could be a bit more leg room in the back seats.

I personally really prefer the design of the A4 station wagon (called an Avante here) to the sedan. On the A6 and A8 I would probably prefer the sedan. Although on that point, I guess for me, I hope my next car is an Alpha 156 (or the new Porsche Turbo).
