            I bought my 1994 Saab 900 V6 2.5Liter engine with slightly under 90,000 miles on it.  It came with every feature a luxury car might offer: moonroof, power everything (including seats), dual side airbags, ABS, leather interior.  Considering the car was made in 1994 the dual airbag standard option was way ahead of its time.  

I kept up regular maintenance including the large service points.  I eventually bought a few upgrades (new floor mats, Viking Wheels, CD changer, better seats from a seller on EBay).  

Seats: If the heater goes out in them there's no way you can affordably repair it.  Replacing the heater element by hand practically requires a degree in upholstering and electronics.  

Headlight switch: Prone to breaking in its setting but is  still usable. Easily replaced, just annoying how it spins if you decide to turn the headlights 'on' or 'off'.

Struts: The front engine placement has a tendency to wear out front struts pretty quickly.  If you're buying a used Saab with 90,000 or more miles on it you can ride on the old back shocks and springs but it's better to replace them.  Regardless, expect to change the front struts once every 30,000 miles.

Brakes: Wear evenly but must be replaced if mechanic tells you to or if you hear squeaking.  Reason, rotors are very thin and cannot be 'machined' if they wear- easily damaged and expensive to replace.

Electronics: Never had any trouble with wiring or electronics.  However, my antenna got stuck and would not function.  This (and having it taken off in a car wash because people leave the radio/cassette/CD on) is a common problem and easily fixed with a replacement mast and/or motor.

Transmission: Never had any trouble with it at all but was noticing some difficulty shifting into highest gear towards the end of my ownership.  I heard this is a common problem.

Engine (V6): Here is where your real trouble is on these cars.  Most Saabs are four cylinders with or without the turbo option.  I hear if you have the turbo you must take special precaution to lubricate it regularly separately from the main engine (i.e. an oil change will not keep the turbo lubricated.  You must find a mechanic to do it separately for you or do it yourself).  The V6's major problems are a tendency to blow head gaskets (very expensive to fix but won't kill the car if you keep up the oil) and have a timing chain slip (this will will will will kill your car).  The timing chain slip is caused from wear on the sprockets over the heads.  I've read this is the most common problem for the V6.  If you catch a loose chain before it slips you can replace the chain (which involves removing the engine = rediculously expensive) but it won't solve the ongoing problem of the gear which wears quickly.  The best way to fix it is to replace the timing gear mechanisms/cams/chain at once.  If the timing chain slips, I repeat, you won't have an engine (or you will but it will cost five times what the car's worth to fix it).

Replacement parts: Outrageously priced but admittedly better than aftermarket.  I ended up replacing my rotors and skimped on one replacement driver's side through Midas.  It rusted where as the others never did.

Dealer service: These guys know what they're doing but they do charge an arm and a leg to fix anything.  Find an independent who deals with SAAB/Volvo or just SAABS.  They do just as good of work for usually half of the dealer's amount.  If you take your car to another shop do so with the understanding that they use inferior (but less expensive) aftermarket parts.  Many will just do the labor if you can bring them a part (i.e. search the internet for OEM discount SAAB parts before you go).

My Saab story is like so many.  Loved the car (perhaps too much), enjoyed it's unique styling and rarity among road cars.  Even felt a strange bond with all Saab drivers; still do.  A small rattle (barely noticable) persisted the entire time I owned it.  I'd ask shops to make sure everything was OK to avoid surprises.  They'd tell me it was, bill me and hand me the keys.  If I would have searched the internet before hand for Saab problems I would have found it was the timing chain all along.  When it broke (believe me when I say it was an 'out of nowhere' surprise/shock) I soon found that the price of a Saab with less than half the years and miles equal to repairing the engine.  I no longer drive a Saab and check the internet for every opinion I can on every potential problem issue a car I'm considering has before I buy cars now.

Are the 9-3's better?  I may never find out but I can say this.  I've read several reports regarding the 94-98 900 S (also called 'New Generation' or 'NG') and I've come across the same things.  The 94's were the first year the body/chassis/engine changes came about and these had many problems which were under warranty at the time.  If anything, avoid the 94 and get a 95 or newer.  I'm starting to read more and more that new car introductions are always plagued with some type of difficulties so I suspect the 1999 9-3's (first year of 9-3 introduction) probably aren't as good as their counterparts.

Hope this review helps.
