            THIS OPINION HAS BEEN MODIFIED!!!!
I first wrote this opinion a couple of months ago but have since had a change of heart.

A couple of weeks after I wrote the following, I had the largest vehicle repair expense of my life and that is a hard feat to beat considering I used to own a 1989 Jaguar VanDen Plas.

At 45,000 miles, my beloved Mountaineer blew the transmission.  After spending 10 days at the dealer, I was given the sad news that my bill was $2600.

Ouch!  

Likewise, the transmission blew for "no apparent reason".  I didn't take it off-roading.  It wasn't leaking fluid.  It just died!

I don't know if other Mountaineer owners have experienced similar problems but I am kinda curious.

My first opinion - before I had the repair bill from hell!

Looking for a sport utility with class but have a beer budget?  The Mercury Mountaineer is the one for those who us who have taste but not $40K to spend on a car.

After about one month of researching all of the barely used vehicles in 1999, I determined that the Mountaineer was the one for me.  Since it is on the higher dollar end of all of similar sized vehicles, it is easy to find with all of the toys you want in a pre-owned vehicle.  It came equipped with power moonroof, 6 CD changer, leather, power everything and all time 4 wheel drive. 

Roomier than the Blazers and Cherokees, it has lots of features and in everyday driving conditions doesn't have the truck-like feel of the others.  After 2 years of ownership and 45K mileage, I have had only minor problems with it.  

The best thing about this truck is its ability to fit your whole family plus dogs, luggage, Home Depot purchases, etc.  One of the only things that I don't like about it is the steering sometimes feels loose to those of us who were formerly used to driving GM products.

Likewise, the service at the Mercury dealer is awesome.  Free loaners, true estimates, and replacement of my Wilderness tires in under 1.5 hours.  Sure, this vehicle costs a little more than an (new)Explorer but it truly is an awesome value in the secondary marketplace.
