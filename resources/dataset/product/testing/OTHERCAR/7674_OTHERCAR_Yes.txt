            I am the second owner of a little burgundy x-tra cab pickup called Tacoma. I purchased it last July. I use it to drive back and forth to school and work. The peppy little 142 horsepower 4-banger sips fuel, as I average around 30 mpg on the highway. The rear seats are a bit cramped, but not more so than any other pickup in its class. The climate control system is awesome. One of the most appealing features that encouraged my buying decision was the fact that not too many people my age own one of these. They are a bit pricey, Toyotas always hold their value well. <br><br>
