            I  bought my '91 4-runner about 3 months ago. So far it is still in great condition except for a muffler noise and a front end in need of an alignment. This truck has 113000 miles on it and is fairly decked out with options (power everything, CD and Tape deck, etc). The engine is pristine and it runs wonderfully. The body is starting to show its age with a 
bit of rust here and there (mostly hidden behind plastic trim). 

<b>Milage</b>
How it thins the wallet. I get aprox. 20 miles to the gallon on the highway and a little less in the city. Welcome totfhe wonderful world of  SUV's, they all perform similarly when it comes to fuel efficiency.
<b>Handling</b>
Your going to have to pay attention to those recommended speed limit signs around turns. I've heard that you may also want to avoid Firestone tires,tee hee. When it comes to anything off road or uphill, the 4runner is an ace. Its not quite winter yet, but I will update this opinion when I get a chance to drive in some treacherous conditions (if I survive of course) 
<b>Comfort Factor</b>
One word: Cadilac. The sound system is nice for a factory install. The seats are comfy. 
The cruise control is works like a charm. Rear heating gets a thumbs up from my passengers. And I just love taking my 4Runner on road trips (the gas tank could be bit larger though, 15 gallons seems a bit small far a vehicle this size).
<b>Cargo Capacity</b>
For loading and unloading this truck kicks butt. I moved my entire apartment with this SUV. NO problem. The one feature that realy makes this SUV stand out as far as cargo is concerned is the pick-up-like tailgate. The rear window rolls down into the tailgate and the gate then opens down to create a great loading platform. If youve ever banged your head on a hatch-back type tail-gate, you will apreciate this unique feature. It is one of my main reasons for choosing the 4Runner over a Grand Cherokee.
<b>Overall</b>
I have alot of faith in Toyota, my Camry, 11 yars old with over 150000 miles, still runs great. My 4Runner has quite a few miles on it also and it really runs like new. I test drove a few other Suv's and was not impressed. The 4Runner does drive more like a truck than a car, so if you are looking for something to cart the family around town maybe look into a minivan, a much safer choice as well. For the price (I paid $7,0000) I am more than completely satisfied with this SUV. I don't think you will find the level of reliability in any other SUV of the same age and milage. If you are concerned with rust and are looking for an older 4Runner I would recomend checking under the rubber trim around the windows, this is where I found some bad spots on my 4Runner.<br><br>
