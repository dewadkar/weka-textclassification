            One of my roommates owns a 1990 Audi 100, and I have driven it many times in varying road conditions and driving circumstances.  Through this experience I have developed a strong knowledge of this car and its many eccentricities.

At first, I actually liked this car.  It handled well enough in very slow winter driving and the seats were adequately comfortable.  The climate control works very well and the seat heaters are nice in winter weather.  The car also has a very nice center console ski-pass-through in the back seat.  The fifteen-inch alloy wheels are the quality of those on a Mercedes-Benz.  However, as I drove this car more, I started to find its many faults.

To start out, I did not realize until the third time that I drove this car that I had been looking at the tachometer thinking it was the speedometer.  The real speedometer was in a strange position and was very hard to read.

The gear-shifter on the automatic looks really neat but it is a hassle to use because you have to push it down and move it in a strange zig-zag pattern.  In addition, there is absolutely NO way to know what gear you are changing to when it is dark.  The letters on the gate are not lit and there is no display on the dash telling what gear you are in.

The steering wheel requires too much force to turn and the car feels quite unstable taking any turn at more than 10 MPH.  I would think that the quattro feature would provide good handling but it does not seem to.  

The acceleration is abysmal.  The 130 hp 5-cylinder engine is definitely not enough for a car this size, and it is VERY loud.  The gas pedal is also very heavy requiring a strong push to obtain any power.  The brake pedal is also far too heavy allowing very little modulation.

Practically all of the controls are very hard to use.  I have driven the car many, many times and I still struggle when I have to turn on the lights, especially the high-beams!

My friend has had numerous problems with this car in the short time that she has owned it.  Thank goodness that her parents pay for her repairs (unlike my parents).  Most of these problems have been electrical or related to the ignition.  These problems were not cheap to fix.

Finally, this car is UGLY!  The worst examples of car cosmetics from the 80's packed into a car built in the 90's.  The front headlights are way too big and with their strange shape they sort of remind me of the "family truckster" from "National Lampoon's Family Vacation".  The body is shaped like an elongated fig-newton, and is tilted forward which makes it look like the front suspension is broken.  It simply boggles my mind that anyone could find this car even remotely non-ugly.

For the money there are many better used car values.   I would not even suggest borrowing a friend's unless you are curious to drive an example of German engineering at its worst.
