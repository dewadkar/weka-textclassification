            The Dodge Ram Pickup... Everyone's favorite sport vehicle.  Well, watch out over those bumps, those leaf springs might not be holding as well as you'd like to think!  
I have a '99 Dodge Ram, and have had the rear leaf springs replaced 3 times.  Each time with no victory.  There isn't a real 'problem', more like I hear a popping during each acceleration.  That popping is the leaf springs shifting.  No dealership wants to &quot;deal&quot; with this problem.  Sure it's covered under warranty, but is my time?  I think not.  Each time I replace the spring... That is one day of my time.  Take that into consideration!

Hopefully searching for Dodge,
