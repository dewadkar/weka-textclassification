            I am an 18 high school senior.  My father purchased this type of automobile for me, so i would be able to get to point A to point B, without trouble.  
Being diesel, a full tank of gas is relatively cheaper than other high priced automobiles.  It comes to about $20 for a full tank of gas, which is a benefit, since being 18 the only jobs available are part-time minimum wage ones.  
My father got this particular vehicle because of mainly 3 reasons.  The first big one is that this car is basically a moving tank.  It is as sturdy as cars come.  Granted, it does not have airbags.  However, if in the god-forbid circumstances, it can withstand a terribly large amount of force. (ex. another car, a tree, etc.)  You have no safety worries behind this car.
The second main reason was affordability.  My particluar car is from 1984.  Since this car is mercedes AND is diesel, it is made to LAST.  I got it with 120,000 miles on it.  This car should be able to give me at least another 200,000 miles.  The engine is superiorly crafted.  
The third reason he got this car was because it is BEAUTIFUL!!!  It is a very good-looking automobile.
