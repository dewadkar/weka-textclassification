            I have a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Country and I love it!  It has a 6-cylinder engine and plenty of power whether I'm merging into 65 mph traffic on my way to work or going up the mountains in Vermont.  The ride is generally comfortable...although it doesn't compare to the ride in a luxury car by any means!  The occassional rough ride is offset by the fact that I can go through snow without sliding as I did with previous vehicles.

There are only a couple of things I would like to change about this SUV.  The cup holder stinks.  It is a plastic thing that snaps into the side of the console.  It is designed to hold two cups, but I never put anything heavier than a half-full soda in there because the weight will make it fall off.  Also, it's really in a bad position for the passenger whose knees have a tendency to knock into it.  My second complaint is the back seat doors.  They aren't wide enough, especially at the bottom.  It is difficult to get in and out for an adult.  The doors should be upgraded to be the same as on the Grand Cherokee.

I would definitely buy another Cherokee...but possibly the Grand Cherokee instead of the Country version.
