            I have been using the c200 for several months.  It is light-weight and very user friendly.  The camera was up and running in a matter of minutes. It comes with the basics and would be advisable if you are a real photo buff to upgrade to a larger memory.  The pictures are clear, taken under many different conditions.  For the money and the ease of use I feel this is a great value for the dollar.<br><br>
