            I have a 1998 Avalon and absolutely love it!  This was the first new car I ever purchased, so it was an important purchase for me.  I wanted luxury, reliability and stability - and actually had planned to purchase a Camry.  Once I drove the Avalon, however, the decision was made.

This car has POWER!  It is very responsive, and handles beautifully.  When you get in the Avalon, you feel like you are driving a luxury car.  Every aspect of this vehicle says &quot;luxury&quot; - from the heated seats, the terrific stereo system, the plush carpeting, the way the dashboard looks, the way outside sounds are non-existent, and the fact that you don't need a tune-up for 60,000 miles! The interior of the vehicle is very roomy, especially the back seat.  And the trunk - wow!  Not only is it large, but the entrance to the trunk is lower than most vehicles, so you don't have to lift anything too high.  What a wonderful feature, especially for a single woman.

In short, this is the best car I have ever owned, or driven.  My brother owns a new Mercedes sports car, and I much prefer driving my own vehicle, which says a lot!

Test drive an Avalon - you'll fall in love with it!<br><br>
