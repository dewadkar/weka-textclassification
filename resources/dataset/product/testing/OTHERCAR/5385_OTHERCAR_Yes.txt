            It was the summer of 1998.  My 1987 Ford Taurus' transmission had gone kaput for good.  Time to choose a new vehicle!  I wanted a pickup truck.  I wanted a beautiful truck that I could be proud of.  I chose a 1998 Club Cab Dodge Dakota.

I'll be honest when I say that my truck has not been perfect.  The paint scratches ever-so-easily (the pearl coat!), and the spark plugs ping on 87 octane.  The shocks in the back squeak.  What is perfect, though?  If I had chosen a Ford Ranger, would it have less problems than my Dodge or any other truck?  The answer must be no.  Any vehicle has problems, no matter what make, model, or price you pay.

The few problems it has had--as all vehicles do--don't eclipse the great features of the Dodge Dakota.  The perfect lines of the Dodge Dakota amaze me every time I see the truck.  The well-designed interior and comfortable seats make the truck a joy to drive.  The engine is very reliable.  The side view mirrors are substantial in size.

The back seat (a.k.a. Club Cab) can seat one adult (sideways), two mid-sized children, or three very small children comfortably.  Since I most of the time drive solo, I consider it more of a storage area.  It's such a convenience to have extra space to store book bags, tennis racquets, jackets, and/or other potential clutter.  Once you go Club Cab, you'll never return!

Regrets?  Well, one thing I wish I had opted for was a V6 engine for more power.  However, with rising gas prices, I'm beginning to think I chose correctly.  The 2.5L I-4 is not large by far, but gets me around just fine.  Another regret is that I didn't get a 4x4.  All potential truck buyers should consider this.  When your tires start balding and you don't have 4-wheel-drive your back end becomes a sled of sorts!

All in all, I believe I made a good choice.  The Dakota Club Cab is an overall good pick for a truck.  To you potential buyers, consider the Quad Cab.  Though more expensive, it offers two extra doors and a LOT more space for those who decide to ride in the back seat.  I tend to think of the Quad Cab as a hybrid between a &quot;traditional&quot; new style (97+) Dakota and a Durango, and if you compare pictures you'll see what I mean.

If you buy a Dakota, I can promise you that it won't be perfect, but you'll be getting one <b>bee-u-tee-ful</b> truck!<br><br>
