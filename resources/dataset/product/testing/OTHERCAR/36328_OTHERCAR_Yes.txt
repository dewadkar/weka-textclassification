            Couldn't resist the 2.9% financing and my wife wanted a new sports car.  So the Chevy dealership offered me a lot for my trade in and took $2000 off the price of the car.  So, how do I like it now?  For the price I paid 18,900, I like it.  I like it a lot.  

This car can get up and go.  I bought the V6 version.  Now, I have owned a mustang before and that car didn't have nearly the amount of get up and go that this car does.  I believe the Horse Power is 250 and it drives like all those horses are running.

The steering is pretty tight.  I find it hard to turn, but the car makes up for it handling wise.  I feel this car could turn on a dime but it takes some muscles in doing so.

The inside of the car is pretty much non-existent.  The back seat, of course, is small.  Little kids only will fit in the back.  The passenger side floor board has this big hump to the left allowing you only to put your feet on the right.  Trunk space is OK for a sports car.  Don't expect to put more than two medium sized suitcases in the trunk.

The sound system ROCKS.  Very very nice.  A neat feature to the sound system is when you turn off the engine to the car, the radio is still on until you open the door.  I thought that was cool.  

The camaro comes with an alarm and daylight running lamps.  Also featured is cruise control.

Bottom line:  This is not a family car.  If one person is driving it most of the time, this car is for you.  It is fast, very fast, and handles very well.  One thing I did forget to mention.  Visibility is LIMITED.  Even looking out the windshield.  If you have view of a sun setting, you will get tons of glare.  I recommend this car for the single driver, who likes decent gas mileage, and wants to rule the road for a cheap price.  To find a better deal, you need to make lots of money and buy a corvette.
