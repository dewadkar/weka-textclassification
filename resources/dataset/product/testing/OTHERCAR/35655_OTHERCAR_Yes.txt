            --==This review is specifically of the v6 coupe==--

The first time I test drove the new Accord, I was impressed the second I sat down in the comfortable leather seats. The car I first drove was an EX automatic v6. I knew I didn't want the sedan, or the automatic for that matter, but I had to start somewhere, and at the time this was the only new accord at the dealership. 

The 2003/4 accords are the 7th generation accords, following up the award winning '98-'02 6th Generation Accords. Some will argue that there was no need for Honda to overhaul the entire Accord project, as its sales were still doing extremely well in 2002. Nevertheless, Honda did overhaul the model line, and left us with this (controversially) beautiful car. The styling is completely new, as is the engine. Anyways, on to my review:

<b>First Driving Impressions</b>

Back at my first test drive, I was pulling out of the parking spot when I immediately noticed the extremely sensitive gas and brake pedals, a common characteristic of Japanese cars. Being used to my German-made BMW, I had put my foot down on the gas with authority, and realizing that I was reversing much too fast for my own good, depressed the brake, only to find myself dead stopped within half a second. This only took about 5 minutes to get used to, as I have had other cars like this in the past. 

Out of the parking lot on a beautiful Sunday morning, I was able to see how this new Accord drove. The steering is tight and concise, and the power is really something else. The car comes with 240 horsepower and 212 lb-ft of torque: not a slouch. Honda listened when the 6th generation owners complained about lack of low end power. 

Another common complaint about the previous generation of accords was the automatic transmission logic. For example, you might pull into a parking lot and want to be in 1st or second gear, but the transmission would stay in fourth until you really put the pedal down. Then the car would downshift to the desired gear and shoot you forward like a bullet. This problem does not exist with the new Accord automatic transmission. The Transmission's downshifts and upshifts are smooth and logical, almost not even noticable. 

Overall, the car drove better than I had expected. My first experience with the car was very favorable.

<b>My Car</b>

Before I knew it, I was the proud owner of an Accord EX v6 Coupe with the optional 6speed Manual transmission. The buying experience was overall pleasurable, however, the price really wasn't negotiable on my car, as the 6 speed v6 coupe is a limited production variant of the car. The car was flawless off the lot with only 1.4 miles on it. Now I will get into specifics that pertain to my car...

<b>Styling</b>

I love the styling of the new Accord coupe; however, not everybody is as enthusiastic as I am. Styling is really not something that I can write a review on easily, as everybody has their own opinion on what and what doesn't look good. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, lets leave it at that.

<b>Engine</b>

The particular engine in the v6 accords is the Honda J30A4. This is the Honda engine code: The "J" pertains to the block/throttle body/engine type; the "30" pertains to the displacement (3.0 Liters); and the "A4" is the version number. For example, the previous v6 accords had the J30A1 under their hoods. 

The engine is rated at 240hp and 212lb-ft of torque. Honda gave the new engine an significant torque increase and 40 more horsepower than the 6th generation Accords. 

The engine's power delivery is very linear, and feels almost as smooth as an inline 6 cylinder engine as was in my BMW. The 6 speed Accord coupes actually have tiny bit more power than the other v6 Accords. This is because the 6 speed models have a removed intake resonator (for a better sound/growl and higher RPMs), and a different intake manifold with the addition of a butterfly valve not found on the other v6 models. This only adds up to an estimated 5 extra horsepower, but it is worth mentioning. 

<b>Transmission</b>

The Automatic transmission I test drove was very smooth and the logic mapping was extremely good. It has 5 gears, up from 4 from the previous transmisson. However, I can't comment too much on the auto, as I have the manual variant.

The optional 6 speed transmission takes a little getting used to, but once you have it, the fun never stops. The clutch is a little wierd... I find the word "wierd" to be a bit crude, but there really isn't a better word for it. It's not really bad nor good, just wierd. The clutch doesn't engage until the last 4th of the pedal stroke, creating a bit of a learning curve, but it really is not a huge issue. Once you get used to the clutch, the 6 speed is a joy. Relitively short throws and close ratios make the transmission a step up from what is expected from an Accord. 

It should be mentioned that Honda has never made an Accord v6 offered with a manual transmission. Manual Accords previously only existed with the inline 4 cylinder engine.

<b>Handling</b>

Coming from a BMW, the handling was not exceptional. The body rolled quite a bit in the tight corners, and the stock tires do not help the situation. This being said, the car is certainly capable. Just in comparison to my BMW, the car is not in the same league when it comes to handling. Getting a new set of tires as I did helps the situation quite a bit, however not completely. The optional Factory Performance package offered on the '04 models help. This package includes 5 spoke 17" wheels, sport shocks, and springs that lower the car 1". 

<b>Performance</b>

Car and Driver got the 6 speed variant of the new accord to go 0-60mph in 5.9 seconds. Thats quite a number for a "family" car. They also ran mid 14's in the quarter mile, also not bad times at all. This car could really be classified as a performance car in a family car's disguise.

<b>Problem Areas</b>

The '03 model does have some problems that I assume were for the most part fixed for the '04 models. I will go over the problems anyways:

The first problem I had was that the headliner started rattling at somewhat high speeds (80mph+). I took it in to the dealership, and they fixed it within an hour under warranty. 

The second problem I encountered was that the molding underneath the window on the outside of the car was starting to fold in on itself. Not a big deal at all, but again I took it to the dealership and they fixed it all under warranty. 

The third and last issue I had was a bit more of a problem. My brake rotors warped at about 12,000 miles. You know your rotors are warped when your steering wheel starts to shake when braking. Again, I took the car in and everything was fixed free of charge... however, it is unnerving that my rotors warped with so few miles on the car.

<b>Final Thoughts</b>
Overall, the car is wonderful. Although there have been a few slight problems, the car has not let me down. The comfortable interior along with the sporty looking exterior never fail to excite me, and the power is just amazing for a Honda Accord. A great car for the price.
