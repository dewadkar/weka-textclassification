            I recently purchased a 1996 Saab 900 S Hatchback. I love this car! It has a huge hatch and the rear seats fold down to create gargantuan cargo space. It's a nice solid ride although it does rattle a little when it's cold first thing when you start it. It's also very attractive, it looks WAY more expensive than it was and has some great features. It appeals to my "Champagne taste on a beer budget" sensiblities and I would absolutely recommend others to check one out used. The Saab depreciates so much, a well maintained used Saab is the way to go. I have been warned about astronomical repair bills, but also heard great things about their reliability. The only things I don't really like are the seats, mine are cloth and although they are heated (yea!) I always feel too tall ( I'm 5'6") and can seem to get completely comfortable. Thank heaven for head room, which is very ample. The other flaw and this is probably the one I feel strongest about is it takes turns horribly. I've tried approaching turns in several ways, adjusting my speed and style, but it seems like the car wants to roll right into the curb! I would imagine with time this will change as I become accustom to driving the car. But overall, a really awesome car!! I love it!
