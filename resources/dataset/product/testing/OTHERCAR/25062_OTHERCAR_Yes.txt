            I have had a Kodak DC-260 for just over a year now and loved it. I got an e-mail from Kodak about their 2 new cameras - the 5000 and the 4800. The 5000 is built for the outdoorsy types with its waterproofing, etc. The 4800 was built for photographers. I went on the waiting list, paid my money and got the best camera you can buy for less than $1000.

There is so much going for this camera from its 3.1MP (mega-pixel) images to its programmable operation and built in rechargeable battery.

I have been using this camera for the last 2 weeks taking pictures for web site work and for ID card backgrounds. I have also been using it with an NEC 4650 color laser. The results are amazing - 10x8 prints on high brightness paper look like photographs.

The 4800 seems to offer a good balance between features and size, it would be nice to have interchangeable lenses, but they do have an optional lens adaptor kit to offer wide and telephoto capabilities. In additon to the fully automatic exposure mode there are both aperture priority and fully manual settings. Unusually on a digital camera there is an exposure adjustment control, ideal for working with sunsets, etc.

I love the solid feel, the image quality, the nifty way it appears as an extra drive on the system it is connected to and its rechargeable battery.
There is nothing to hate about it.....

Anyone looking to spend $600 to $800 on a camera, should look no further than the DC4800 it is the king of personal digital cameras<br><br>
