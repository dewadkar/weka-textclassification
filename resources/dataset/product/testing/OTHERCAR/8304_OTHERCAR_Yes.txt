            My Corolla is a 2003 "S" model with power doors , windows, moonroof, mirrors, air conditioning, leather wrapped wheel and shifter, 6 speaker cd player, spoiler, aluminum rims, fog lights, body side molding, cruise control and automatic transmission. I spent 2 weeks test driving other cars but immediately fell for the Corolla. Another model I looked at was the Mazda Protige. This car drove very smooth, but I did not care for the interior layout. There was no center console, and head room in the back wasn't great. Also, the resale value had an effect on my decision not to buy.
I drove an Oldsmobile Alero. It was loaded with features, but I found it noisy and uncomfortable inside. The seats were too snug ( my husband and I are not large people). 
I tried a Pontiac Sunfire. It was nice too drive, but the features were not plentiful. Overall, it had a cheap feel to it from the others. However, for feature/value the price was right. Others I looked at were Saturn, Nissan Sentra,and Honda Accord.
When I drove the Corolla, I knew it was the car for me. The interior is very comfortable. Cup holders in the back for my son. Plenty of leg room too as he is now taller than me! The feel of the car is elegant yet sporty. I've had the car for over a month now and have had no problems whatsoever. Gas mileage is 38mpg, thats a combination of city and highway. So far the only complaint I have is that you cannot have the rear windows down if you are going faster than 70km. You get an awful wind vibration, not just noise. It actually hurts the eardrums. If a front window is down it balances and the vibration goes away. Unfortunately, my black lab likes his head out at all times and I like my window up. He may not get as many drives now! 
Another small annoyance is that the side windows do not clear the morning dew by rolling down and then up. My old car did that and it saved getting the squeegee out.
This is the first Toyota I have owned. Wherever I go people tell me I made a good choice, and they are really impressed with the sporty look of the 2003, so I do feel good about my purchase even though I feel I paid too much. There were not many around on the car lots, and this was the only one in the city that had everything I wanted. It had been ordered in for someone who changed their mind on the colour. Even still, for the features it has, and the quality of a Toyota, it was a better value than any other car I had considered. All would have cost more if the same features were included, and they were all 2002 models. I like my car!
