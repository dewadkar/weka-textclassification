            In October 99, my wife and I purchased a Silverado with the intent of using it to haul antiques, yard supplies, etc.  We went with the extended cab and the 5.3 L engine.  So far, we have been thoroughly happy with our truck.  The cab is very roomy.  The seats are comfortable - so comfortable that we joke that the seats are like lazy boy chairs.  The 6ft bed is big enough to haul just about anything we have had to move.  We have had 5 people in the truck at once.  The back seat is roomy enough for a taller people (6ft+) but I would not suggest going on long trips with many riders.  The engine is powerful enough for us but it does drink gasoline.  We strongly recommend the chevy silverado to anyone; it is a smooth riding, fun to drive, and economically priced truck.
