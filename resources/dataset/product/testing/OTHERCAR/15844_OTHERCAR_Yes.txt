            This is a great choice for professional pictures. Captures good pictures in any situation using all the options in the menu. Even includes a few photo effects. Takes great pictures in the dark when using the night time mode. Clear, bright viewfinder with multiple brightness settings. I used it mostly to take close up pictures of items and it captures details excellently. Good resolution for full page prints on photo paper. Digital zoom is the most useless feature on any camera. All it does is just makes the pixels larger. You dont actually zoom in and get more detail. The movie mode is useful with decent quality video. The video is good, but not that great because it lacks sharp details. The battery and charger it comes with last long enough for me, but the 8MB card it came with was very tiny. I had to go out and get a 128MB right away. I was then able to take about 130 full quality pictures or 5 minutes of high quality video, plenty of room. I bought a Sony instead of other brands because it used Memory Sticks and my laptop had a Memory Stick slot. This made things easier for me because I could just slide the stick into my computer instead of fiddling with the USB cable to connect the camera. Another useful thing I found I could do with the camera was use it a portable disk drive. When I plug it into a computer via USB, it will show up as a disk, and I can move files around from computer to computer easily.
