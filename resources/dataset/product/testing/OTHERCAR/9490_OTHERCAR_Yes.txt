            My husband and I own a 1996 Dodge Ram extended cab 4x4 truck. We still get compliments on the looks of the truck. It handles well for such a big vehicle and seats 6 comfortably. The leg room in the back seat isn't the greatest, but the seat is a lot more comfortable than most back seats of full size trucks. This truck is great for a family that enjoys the outdoors and off road travel. The gas mileage is decent for such a big truck. We have over 46,000 miles on the Dodge and haven't had any  mechanical problems. There are a few squeaks in the truck due to the amount of rough terrain we travel over, but overall it's been a great truck!<br><br>
