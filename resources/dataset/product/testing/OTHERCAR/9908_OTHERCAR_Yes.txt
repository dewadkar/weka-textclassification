            I was looking for a small, not very expensive and in a good condition car. The MX-2 was on my list along with some other larger cars. I have a crush for hatchbacks so I intentionally looked for one.
It turned out to be a great car. I am driving it 4 months - so far not a major problem. I am the third owner, the car had 88,000 miles on it. Now it has 91,000 and it is happily looking for more:)
The overall look of the car is beautiful. I really like this big glass hatch. The trunk is surprisingly roomy and convenient. The bucket seats and very comfortable. Let's be honest - this car doesn't have back seats:) They are small and you can not sit there for more than an hour. But it is really comfortable for 2 persons.
The console is very well designed and ergonomic. I occasionally drive it for more than 6 hours and I felt great after going out of it. I guess during early 90s the automatic seat belts were popular, but I hate those. Real stranglers.
It has blind spot, all right. If you have a panoramic rear view mirror and get used to them you will be just fine.
I knew about the engines in advance  so I properly choose the V6. It is amazing how Mazda was able to fit in a V6 under this small hood. It is a great engine. Very smooth and quite. It doesn't have a very high torque on lower RPM, you can feel the sudden pull at about 4000. But this is a sporty car and you should drive it like one. Gas milage is really bad in the city - 20/22 - for 1.8L engine. Stick shift is a must. I can not imagine this car with an automatic transmission - it would be a disaster.
One big advantage is the very low center of gravity. Very stable on the road, sticky on the turns. It has some tendency to understeer at high speed, I guess it is because of the heavy 1.8L engine in the front. If you get used to it becomes an advantage.
I think it was a great mistake from Mazda to stop making this great car. I would love to see a revival. Anyway, if you decide to buy MX-3 do not forget it was designed in the early 90s. Do not expect all the bells and whistles you would find in a brand new car (mine doesn't have air bags for example.) 
If you like small sporty cars - this one is definitely a very good choice. Family car - never.<br><br>
