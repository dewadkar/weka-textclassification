            I enjoyed my Chevy Cavalier for about three days!! It was a '97 and I
just needed a car.  I'm not a car person, so I went with Chevy because it
is close to my home, and Cavalier just because I liked the color.  I just
used it cruise around my little town, and never put many miles on it..
My problem was.. it just didn't start!! Yep, it didn't start!!  In the
two years that I had this &quot;car&quot;(?)I had to have it towed from my garage
to the dealership  FIVE TIMES because it just simply didn't start.  Turn the key, and
NOTHING!!!  First time they said they &quot;fixed&quot; it.  Second time they said
they REALLY &quot;fixed&quot; it.  Third and fourth time I was told that I needed to
drive it more!! Well, I thought I was going to GM prison because I didn't
drive enough.  I told them that I was not  about to change my driving habits and that that was a ridiculous excuse.  I wrote to GM, and did all
the &quot;stuff&quot; a person does when they are pushed to the limit. I still had
my cavalier.   When it happened the FIFTH time, I called the owner of the
dealership.  I cried, and fought,and argued, and cried some more.  And
guess what??  He put me into a '99 Prism for 25 dollars a month more!! And
I still had two years to go on my cavalier, and didn't have to put any
money down!!!  The dealership was GREAT!!I felt very satisfied after
suffering for TWO years... I LOVE my prism.....HATED the CAVALIER!!!!!
PLEASE!!! DO NOT PURCHASE A CAVALIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
