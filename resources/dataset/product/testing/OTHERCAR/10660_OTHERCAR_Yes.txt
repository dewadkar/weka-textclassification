            I love my '98 Plymouth Grand Voyager.  It holds us, the two kids and the dog with room to spare.  It has lots of room, lots of cubby spaces, did I mention lots of room?

We've not had one bit of trouble with it aside from one of the wheel covers coming off on our first real outing (the dealer gladly replaced it for us). No rattles, no squeaks, no trips to the dealer, nothing.

This is our second car that we've bought new and it was by far easier.  We bought it online and it was, get this, delivered to our house!!  Good thing since our other two cars decided to pick that day to quit working and I was due in 3 weeks.

I do have one complaint.  I'd like to get my hands on the idget that decided positioning the cup holders in front if the climate controls was a nifty idea.
