            I wanted to like the Boxster. I knew personally the head of Porsche North America and waited with great anticipation when it was first announced. As an owner as driver of various Porsche models over the years, I have learned to form my own opinions based on a bank of 30 years experience.
 First the good. High build quality overall, paint is excellent, and I do love those headlights! Mid engine placement gives good neutral handling. The engine has a nice sound and tries hard. Brakes are powerful. The convertible top is easy to use. "Some" of the appointments inside are nice.
Now the bad.
The standard model is grossly underpowered. The gearing helps some to compensate but the feeling overall is unsatisfying. While the seats are of good quality I personally had a hard time finding a comfortable position. I never felt a "part" of the car.
The standard dash plastic is poor with a shiny look that screams cheap. My understanding is that the optional leather trim for the dash improves this somewhat. The tachometer and speedometer are easy to read. But the radio is almost impossible to adjust while driving. This porsche would be a good second sports car that was driven daily. The S model is the one for more serious sport driving.
Considering the cost of this vehicle I would recommend a two year old 911 which would give you a much more satisfying experience. Sorry Doctor, this one is a miss..
