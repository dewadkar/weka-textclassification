            My husband and I had an old truck that was given to us and I was tired of driving a piece of junk.  We decided to buy a brand new car and so I looked for a good month.  We were on a budget and so I had to make sure I found the best car for the money.  The first thing that caught my eye about the Cavalier was the way it looked.  I test drove 3 different Cavaliers.  We ended up buying a 1999 black 4-door basic model except for the C.D player.

The car's now about a year and a half old.  We've had one very minor problem with it.  The battery went out on it right after it reached a year, but we got the problem fixed for free.  There's rattling that we got fixed... but overall we've had very little problems with the car.  I love my car, but only as a first car.  I would never recommend this car for people who've had new cars in the past.  It's very basic.  One problem that we have found is that the gas mileage isn't all that great.  We drove 8 hours from San Antonio, TX to Oklahoma City, OK and had to fill up half way there driving 65-70mph.  If you're looking for a good sound system, this car has it.  As far as a 4-cylinder is concerned this car definitely has some pick-me-up.  It does have a very smooth and quiet ride as soon as we got rid of the small rattles.

Now my husband and I are on a higher income level and so I plan to buy a car that I put more thought into as well as looking beyond the exterior.  But like I said... it's a great first car and I would recommend it, but not for everyone.
