            just back from my every 4 year torment of buying a new company car according to the guidelines...must be 6 cyl auto 4 drs etc etc blah blah. this time around my allowance was 23425 plus tags and tax so the field was a little more interesting than in years past. I drove the Intrigue twice and was overall impressed at the super acceleration( 3.5 dohc is a screamer especially from 50-75 mph) and the car handles nimbly and precisely(drove both the PCS model and the non PCS GL models)
I like the interior, in leather it's clean and well designed but the exterior styling frankly did not light me up(or turn me off)..choice of colors though is overly conservative/BORING).
Anyway the seats are good, handling is good and the car feels tight(although first 2 years of production were apparently somwhat less than perfect)  Would I recommend this car-- yes but with reservations--1- NTHSA stats are terrible--passenger and back seat passenger side impact stats are apparently among the worst out there(why don't they at least put in side airbags?? and 2- price is a little high compared to what you get: i had several deals on a honda accord lx v6(they only come loaded) at 22800 whereas the Ols, at around 23200 was a choice of either PCS, Sunroof or CD Premium stereo( but only 1 of these pricey options) in the end I bought a Dodge Intrepid ES...more features and better crash results.<br><br>
