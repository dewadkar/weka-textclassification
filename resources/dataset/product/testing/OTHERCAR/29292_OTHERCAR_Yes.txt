            If you want a sports car, you'll like the Camaro. If you want a sports car but need seating for more than two people, forget it and get a Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Saab, or other sports sedan. But this is a very good sports car with sleek looks.

Storage
Although it offers hatchback versatility, the Camar o's trunk space is limited to 13 cubic feet. Of course, you can keep stuff in the rear seat if no one's back there.

Comfort
The Camaro has a very stiff ride. Even small bumps provoke hard kicks, but the ride is good enough on smooth roads. Noise is okay; the engine roars during hard acceleration.

The front seats are fairly comfortable, although the passenger's seat has a bulge on the left-hand side which makes it rather uncomfortable. Access is awkward.

The rear seat is useless for most people. Don't use it unless you must, and even then, only put small children in. When the front seats are even slightly reclined, rear seat occupants' legs are painfully wedged between the two seats. Access to the rear seat is awkward, and getting out of the rear seat is miserable.

Driveability
The Camaro handles very well. The 5.7-liter V8 provides plenty of power, and the brakes are great. The Chevy is fun to drive.

Controls and displays are clear, but the driving position is a little bit too far away from the steering wheel. Visibility is hideous, a problem with many sports cars. Being very low and having very wide roof pillars, the Camaro is abysmally hard to see out of.
