            I'm renting the 4Runner and have had it just over three weeks. I've spent time driving it on both highways and back roads, maneuvering it in and out of parallel parking spaces, braving the pothole stricken streets of Boston, and threading it through the congested airport roadway. I've driven it in rain, but so far, have no temptation to take it up a rocky incline or through a muddy pasture, though I have no doubt these are the types of terrain that 4Runner was truly designed for.

I've always thought of Toyotas as dull and overpriced and this model is no exception. My first thought when it comes to the 4Runner is how anyone can justify paying $28,000 for a vehicle that is so stripped down: No rear height adjusting seatbelts; no side airbags; Firestone Wilderness tires; and stick-to-your-clothing upholstery. By the time you add on the desirables - moonroof, leather, fog lights, heated power seats - the price spikes up to around $36,000. You could get a BMW for that, or a loaded Explorer or Grand Cherokee for even less. 

Upon hoisting myself up into the 4Runner, I find the driver's seat to be soft and supportive. On the base model, there is no height adjustment, but at 5"3, I haven't found that to be a problem. The view up here is commanding and visibility is exceptional. The tilt steering wheel is quick and easy to adjust. However, considering how close I sit to the wheel, I find myself leaning slightly over toward the passenger side to reach the radio and climate controls. Not only are these instruments not angled nicely toward the driver, they are placed far beyond the fingertips. Like all Toyotas I've ridden in, I do like the illuminated ignition. The engine starts up with an angry roar - the kind that makes people hesitate before crossing in front of your parking space. The 4Runner reminds me and all those around it that it is a TRUCK. And from this point forward, it will behave like a truck. 

Once you put it into drive, the engine settles down and the transmission shifts smoothly. Make no mistake, in the 4Runner you will feel every little uneven surface, bump, rut, and pebble on the road. Some of the more significant dips and potholes produce a jarring effect, and the 4 Runner has a tendency to thrash its occupants from side to side. As one of my passengers said, "This thing beats you up." I compare it to the Ford Explorer, which in my experience, has a much more civilized ride. By the time you're up to around 35mph, the whirring noise from 4Runner's beefy tires cannot be ignored. On the highway, wind and road noise soon take over. You'd think with all the slamming and banging along the road, the interior would protest. But that's where Toyota's legendary integrity comes in. I have yet to hear one squeak or rattle. 

At this point, I recommend turning on the stereo. This model has a single CD/cassette unit with six speakers, (including the tiny tweeters mounted on the front doors.) The buttons are large and easy to read, as is the display screen. There aren't too many bells and whistles to distract you, but I do appreciate the added Mid level adjustment. The sound quality is sharp and full of rich bass. I replaced the factory stereo in my other car, but would not feel the need to do so on the 4Runner. Another plus: The 4Runner has a generous turning ratio. U-turns and crowded parking areas are not as challenging as you might expect from a vehicle of this size.

Handling is definitely an area where the 4Runner falls short. Again, in comparison with the Ford Explorer, I've found that when driving the 4Runner, I have to slow way down before taking a corner. And when the roads are wet, watch out! One rainy morning, I was doing a mere 25mph on a rotary, when the thing began to slide sideways. An alarm went off and a little red light came on in the form of a truck skidding out of control. Well, no kidding! I wonder how much that "feature" costs. After surviving the roundabout, I timidly continued on my journey, not sure what other surprises 4Runner had in store for me. This is the kind of suspense I can do without.

Now let's talk about the climate control. In the 4Runner, it's really a contradiction in terms. Since I'm driving the base model, it doesn't have automatic climate control. (Maybe that comes on the $36,000 model?) The heater is either way too hot, or way too cool. In any case, I find myself constantly having to stretch over and adjust the controls, frustrated at the unnecessary distraction it causes. 

On the flip side, I do like the 4Runner's "real" chrome bumpers. They mean business: no cracked plastic or scratched off paint like you see on many bumpers going down the road. So, there's one less worry for owners. I haven't put the 4Runner's large backseat and vast cargo area to the test, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to take it on an outing to Home Depot. 

I have to return this car in a few days, but I will not miss it. I would never consider owning a 4Runner because for me, there's no value in purchasing a bare bones SUV for nearly 30 grand. Especially one that rides awful and scares the driver.
