            My mother in law has one of these cameras and I would say that out of all I have seen that this is a camera that is very easy to use.It takes no time for you to snap your pictures, and load them onto your computer or Floppy disk.It actually takes really good pictures, she doesn't use a regular camera anymore now that she can get her pictures and see how they turned out just minutes after she takes them.
The Polaroid Photomax camera is at the top of my list because it is so easy to use and it comes with a great program that enables you to make several things and even print your pictures on a sheet of paper in multiple numbers.I, myself, rather like that option because it saves you time on trying to  get the exact size and having to go back each time to print more that one of the same size. You can do it all at once.
It is my opinion that if you ever use the camera that you will love it and the program that comes with it.<br><br>
