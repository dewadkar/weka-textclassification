            I just recently bought a 2000 Saturn SL1 after months of research and hoping that my old Chevy Celebrity would hang on long enough for to make make a wise decision, rather than one forced by necessity. I lucked out and the old Chevy held on while I researched and researched and finally concluded that Saturn was the best car for safety, value, comfort and reliability when all were important.

I think by now, most people have heard about Saturn's reputation for safety. During my research they scored extremely well in government crash tests. At the dealership, they proudly had a bulletin board of smashed up Saturns, that the owners had walked away form with only minor bumps and bruises. Some of these cars had been crushed like an accordion from both sides, but the passenger compartment was never compromised. With standard dual air bags and a frame designed and modeled after NASCAR cars, I feel completely protected from the lunatics on the road.

My Saturn's final bill came to $16,020, thanks to Maryland state tax, tags, and the state tire recycling fee (I want to see this tire recycling facility!) Saturn's charge for this 4-door car was $15,100. For my money, I got the following options: automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, AM/FM radio w/CD player, power locks, security system and keyless entry. These options came in at about an extra $2,300, which isn't bad considering the AC and automatic transmission accounted for $1600 of that. 

Many people may feel that a Saturn is too small for them. I was a little concerned so I focused on the 4-door SL. It certainly looked big enough for my needs (no family) and with fold-down rear seats, the trunk expands to provide more than enough room. My first weekend with the car, I played chauffeur to many of my friends to show of the new car. I asked each of them how the legroom was in the back and they all said it was terrific! Even the six-footers had no complaints. The back seats also come with harness restraints for car seats if you do have a family or are thinking of starting one.

The Saturn engine is built to last, but is laid out simply enough that regular maintenance is a piece of cake, even if you want to do it yourself. This was an encouraging sign, because I strongly believe that the simple things work best. One key engine feature I like is the use of a timing CHAIN rather than a timing BELT. Theoretically, unlike many cars, the Saturn will never have to replace the timing chain, which in other cars is destined to wear out and need replacement.

Some other miscellaneous benefits of a Saturn include no pressure or haggling with salesman. There is something to be said for a company confident enough in their product to say &quot;Here is our car. If you like it and can afford it, please consider us. If not, then have a nice day.&quot; Also, the gas mileage on Saturns is very good with close to 40 miles per gallon on the highway. With the rising gas prices, this cannot be dismissed. Also, I could not believe it, but my insurance rate went down! It cost me more to insure a 12 year old car than a brand new Saturn. This is due to the enormous reputation for safety that comes with the Saturn.

If you are single or a newlywed, the Saturn seems like the perfect car. It is sporty enough in design and amenities to feel &quot;cool&quot; but practical enough to not burst the budget and be as headache free as any car can be. It also is roomy enough that a young couple planning on starting a family will not outgrow it quickly. 

If you like practical, affordable automobiles with a splash of fun so you don't feel like a fuddy-duddy, the Saturn has got to be at the top of your list to check out. <br><br>
