            I bought my Grand Marquis new almost three years ago.  In 40,000 miles of driving I have had no repairs and no service issues.  I use Mobil One synthetic oil and change it every 5,000 miles along with the oil filter.  I bought this car because I wanted a V-8 engine and rear wheel drive.  Driving in Florida presents no snow problems but the "Florida Ice" does.  For the uninitiated, "Florida Ice" is the oil residue on top of a roadway after a rain, making for hazardous conditions what with our afternoon showers in the summer.  The demographics for this car indicate a large percentage of drivers over 50, so it it not a car that will usually appeal to the younger set.  I have found this type car to be extremely reliable in the past and this one is fine.  The interior appointments are ergonomicaly good, at least for me.  Seat adjustments, radio and power window controls are easy to reach as are the power mirror controls and the cup holders  The only thing I dislike are the automatic door locks which activate at about 5 MPH or any time a door is opened,  then it will lock again when closed with the transmission in gear.  Disconcerting if someone opens a front door, places something in the back seat and then tries to re-open front door.  I understand the safety technology behind it, but I am a big boy and prefer to open and close my own locks, thank you.  Seat support is good for long trips and short drives.  If you are looking for a large car with rear wheel drive, smooth ride and gas mileage in the low 20's this could be the one for you.
