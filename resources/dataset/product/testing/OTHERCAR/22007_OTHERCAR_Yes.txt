            Having driven both the Mercedes E 230 and the BMW 523, the LS 400 is my dream car come true. It turns on a dime with a simple flick of the finger, is tremendously responsive in acceleration, and is whisper soft in operation (careful - you could easily turn the ignition key because you can't hear the engine running!)

The sound system is to die for - better than many full size home systems - whether on soft Bizet or on blaring Deep Purple. The much vaunted German competition isn't even in the same class - even after I threw out the Merc's pedestrian Blaupunkt and replaced it with a Nakamichi.

As expected with a Lexus, I've never had to send it for any repairs - and their service is exemplary - they'll drop off a spare car and pick it up when done

The ride is super smooth - even on average quality roads, you neither hear nor feel the road. A family of four can really spread out in this car - five travel very comfortably. The boot is seriously large - no problem in taking lots of luggage to the airport or on a cross country trip. 

I do wish they would evolve their own distinctive design - they tend to ape the Merc too much - particularly in the rear end. It would be great if they were to learn from BMW by adding more controls on the steering wheel.
