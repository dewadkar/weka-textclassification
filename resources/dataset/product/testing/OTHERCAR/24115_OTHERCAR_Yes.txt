            I've had my 1991 Acura Legend LS Sedan Automatic for a year now.  My review: 

I adore the 2nd generation Legend and would recommend it to anyone.  13 years later, it is still one of the best looking cars on the street.  If you're thinking about buying this car, then you already know it's aesthetic virtues. 

The G2 Legend was designed in Europe and made in Japan.  Everything about this car behaves in a substantive manner, from the closing of the door to the transmission shifts.  200hp is plenty of power for most and the car corners well for a luxury sedan.  FYI: the accelerator takes some getting used to and there is some understeer when turning at speed.  

The cabin is comfortable and well engineered.  The gauges are probably the one way to date this car.  While just fine by me, the gauges and basic controls are no different than you'd find in an Accord from the late 1980s.  I find the seats to be too deep at the bottom.  I've bought something to remedy this, but I wouldn't say the seat ergonomics are very good.  The leather, relative to newer cars, requires good conditioning and care.    

The factory coat on this car is unbelievable.  My car has seen a lot of desert sun and the white paint is still excellent.  A good wax and it shines like any new car.  

The Bose sound system is alright.  I'm not impressed by the bass output.  I've been told you have to replace all audio components with OEM product, which translates to at least $150 to replace a speaker.  Problems with the sound system have been often reported.  If you want to change out everything, look to spend $1000 for comparable equipment, speakers and rewiring of the vehicle.

A/C works GREAT, even in the desert heat.  Outside of the auto mode, the climate control is a bit cumbersome.  

Gas mileage is no plus.  I give the car hell and get about 17mpg around town.  Haven't taken any trips of substance, but I'd guess you might get 25-28mph on the highway.

You're not going to be able to get an auto loan on a car this old, so you'll have to pay cash.  For reference, I paid $5500 for mine...120k miles, dealer serviced for the life, immaculate condition.  I've put about $1300 into hood struts, a window motor, a window regulator, and new brakes pads.  I'll need to replace the rack soon...another $800.  Look to spend about $7500 for a well maintained Legend...one that won't require any service for at least 20k miles.    

Before you buy, thoroughly check out everything... professional inspection is a real good idea so you know what you're getting into.  I've read mostly about problems relating to the radiator, speedometer, antenna, and audio system.  Personally, I've found the power windows to be the biggest headache, as far as expense.  Expect repairs in a 13 year old car.  If you can't afford the repairs out of pocket, then you can't afford the car.  

I beg of everyone not to rice this car up.  It's perfection as is.  Buy it and enjoy.  :)
