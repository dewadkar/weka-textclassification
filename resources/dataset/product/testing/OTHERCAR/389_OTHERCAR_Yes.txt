             I have not yet purchased my X-TERRA because I have an International Scout which has a NISSAN SD33 TURBODIESEL under the hood. If the new Nissan's are as dependable as the old '80 model I own, I will have to have one, but I think Nissan is missing the boat by not including diesel power on their list of options.
 I have long thought that Nissan should buy up the old International dies and create NISSAN INTERNATIONAL SCOUT III's. I have built one the way it should have been.
 The life expectancy of the diesel engine is reputed to be much more than a gas engine and the torque is amazing, alright so people don't like the noise, but some of us do.
 When I bought my Scout it had 13000 miles on the speedo though I assume it was 213000 since it was underpowered and had considerable blowby. I drove it till you could not see the cars behind you and then tore into it to assess the damage. Besides the 6 holes in the radiator it had a crack between every valve, a hole in one piston, and 2 bent pushrods- and it would still start and go!
 As I began to try to locate parts for my diesel I discovered that International was eliminating the Nissan inventory since they no longer sold Scouts. The parts I could locate were HIGH- $100 for a head gasket,$500 for a set of rings, and $45 for a TAPPET COVER GASKET! To much for me, so I did some research and found out that NISSAN made the same engine and used it in offshore boats and forklifts. A call to SHANNON CORP. FORKLIFTS brought me a set of rings for $200 and a head gasket for $45. Some items are different slightly so I build or modify them to fit. 
 Since I have overhauled the engine it has 60000 miles on it and will probably see 140000 more. The best miles I have driven were in the Rockie mountains, on the back side of Pike's Peak. I drove through the timber until it played out and was headed up through the snow melt at about 13000ft. when my nephews shouted &quot;That's far enough Uncle Dean!&quot;. I could have made it over the top, I know I could. Let the black smoke ROLL!
 NISSAN.DRIVEN.
 INTERNATIONAL-ANYTHING LESS IS JUST A CAR.
