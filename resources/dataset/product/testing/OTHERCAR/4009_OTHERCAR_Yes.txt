            I needed a reliable and affordable vehicle and after hearing and seeing all the commercial hype about saturn I decided to give it a try.  Saturn truly does give new meaning to the term &quot;customer satisfaction.&quot;  Let me assure you that those commercials with the dealers taking pictures of you and clapping...it is all true to life.  My Saturn runs great and is truly designed for the comfort of the owner.  My favorite feature:  the six (count 'em) six cupholders that came with my car. My only stink about this car is the trac button...which I love and hate.  I'm sure the TRACtion button will come in handy in snowy situations up where I go to school, but in the meantime I have to remember to turn it off everytime I start the car...I suspect that if I don't, my gas mileage is affected quite noticeably.  All in all, I couldn't be happier...the people at the dealership are great and I LOVE my new car!<br><br>
