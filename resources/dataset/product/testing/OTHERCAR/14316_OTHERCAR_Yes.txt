            PERFORMANCE
     I opted for the stick shift version of this car. Although the Sentra only has a 4 cylinder engine, it still boasts 126hp and feels like more. It accelerates quickly, even with the (standard) air conditioner on and allows for easy passing in traffic. The shifter itself provides road feedback, further enhancing the driving experience. The suspension is excellent - very smooth ride and a feel of going slower than you actually are. You have a good grip on the road and feel very safe and in control with this vehicle.

OPTIONS / INTERIOR
     The GXE comes standard with all the goodies: am/fm radio, cd player, A/C, tachometer, power windows, power locks, alarm, adjustable seats, keyless entry, and even remote opening of the trunk. My Sentra included the "Road Trip Package" which added a 7 speaker sound system (including subwoofer!), 180 watt head unit, cruise control, and a neat overhead carrying case for sunglasses.
     The cab is very quiet - both from outside noise and from engine noise. You really appreciate it when listening to the stereo. Though not quite as nice as a good aftermarket system, it is above average for a stock radio and I am satisfied with leaving it alone.

SAFETY
     The car is very well put together and you have a good sense of control when driving it. The engine is strong enough to quickly move you out of harm's way and even the standard front disc/rear drum brakes let you stop quickly with very little foot pressure. ABS brakes are also available in a package with side-impact air bags (neither of which I purchased). There are standard dual-airbags and crumple zones, as there are with most 2002 cars.

LOOKS
     Not too blocky, not too bulbous, and certainly not "riced out". Many other cars in this class have a very economy girlish looks to them. Not the sentra...it looks like a smart, full size sedan - and especially looks great from the front. It is available in many combinations of interior and exterior colors. Mine is silver.

WARRANTY
     A 3-year/36k mile powertrain warranty comes standard from Nissan. It covers pretty much any mechanical failure within the engine and transmission. For a little bit more (negotiable with the dealer) I got a 5-year/100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that covers EVERYTHING. It's a nice feeling when the craftmanship is under warrenty and anything else that may happen to your new car is covered by insurance. Ahh.....

OVERALL
     I am VERY pleased with this purchase. Every day I drive my new car I continue to be amazed. You really get a lot of car for little money. The Sentra feels like it belongs in a higher class of cars than it's low MSRP would have you believe.
