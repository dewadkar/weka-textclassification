            I bought my Dodge truck used in Dec. 1997.  I had a 1988 S-10 Blazer that I traded in for it, and was as glad to get rid of it as I was to have my 'new' truck.  There were only two on the lot, a long-bed, and the the one I bought.  I was in love with it the first time I drove it.  I didn't want to wait for the next day to finish the paperwork, so the salesman stayed late to finish.  He gave me $5000 for my Blazer (4-door, 4X4, all the door handles breaking off, etc) and I was glad to get it.  After the deduction for my Blazer,I paid $8995 for it.

I told them the only way I would buy it is if they put brakes and tires on it for me, and they did.  It had almost 50,000 miles on it when I got it, but looked good, had a canvas cover on the bed and drove like a luxury car.  It's emerald green, and the grill is green also.  I've seen so many nice looking trucks (Dodge) that have a chrome grill.  It's kinda eye catching, but I prefer the grill to be the same color as the truck.  I went to transfer insurance, and much to my surprise, it was almost the same as my 4X4, even thought the Dodge was 5 years newer.  You really pay for insurance for a 4x4!!  Even if you don't take it off the road.  Back to my Dodge...

It had a much better sound system that my Blazer....a mid-range and a tweeter in each door, and 2 bass speakers behind the seat. The jack and jack handle had their own place behind the seat as well as the lug wrench.  There are nets behind the seat also to carry papers, school books, or other suitable items.  The spare tire was up under the rear of the bed, so no room is lost there.

I have the 2 door regular cab, and I absolutely love it.  I think I would have liked the king cab a little better, but I'm not gonna trade it in just for that feature.  I've added a cab-high topper to it put on dual exhaust and added a viper alarm.  It seems like everyone that I ride by looks my truck over and I can hear them saying to themselves, &quot;What a nice looking truck!&quot;  Of course, I can't hear them, but I am VERY proud to drive it and be seen in it.  It handles great even in cold or rainy weather.

In the 2-1/2 years that I've had it, I had to put in a fuel pump/filter that is inside the gas tank and was pretty expensive ($300 parts and labor), had the brakes re-done (front), had the fuel injectors cleaned, put bigger tires on it, and tune ups, regular oil changes. 

I now have 118,000 mile on it (yes I travel a lot) and it still runs and looks as good as when I bought it.  Oh yeah...I had to but ball joints on it too, but they were reasonable.  All of the major repairs that I had done have a lifetime warranty, so that eases my mind if things go wrong.

It's equipped with a 5.2 liter(318 CID),power brakes, steering, windows, seats and mirrors, AM/FM cassette and of course air conditioning.  And this A/C will freeze you out!  There is a fold down console that has plenty of room for papers, cassette tapes, and other things, and it folds up out of the way for a third person to ride.  It also has a towing package with factory hitch, lighting, and power steering fluid cooler, a cargo light and a third brake light. (I think these are standard for most cars and trucks anymore).  It has a driver's side air bag and ABS (anti-lock braking).  The headlights will allow you to see far enough in the dark to not have any surprises, and the back up lights are bright enough to back up in the dark with no problem.

I have thought about trading it in for a newer model, but have decided to keep this one.  It is a wonderful truck, easy and fun to drive.  It practically drives itself. It's not an economy car, but it sure gets better gas mileage than either my old S-10 Blazer and way better than the gas hog Ford I had before that.  It has all the power I will need from it, and it will really scoot!  I can haul just about anything in it, and it hardly knows when it goes up a hill, loaded or not.

All in all, I can honestly say &quot;I have found my truck&quot;.  It's everything a person could want in a truck and most of what one would want in a car.  Test drive one and you will see for yourself just why I love it so much.<br><br>
