            Well folks, I rented one for a 2,000-mile trip. Here's what I think of this car, broken down into categories. 

Exterior: I think the exterior is sleek, sexy and nice. It does turn some heads. At speeds over 80 mph the aerodynamic body holds up extremely well. I even took it up to 100 mph and it still drove fine. I love the interior and also like the paint job. I think they paid close attention to make sure the exterior paint was a quality job. It reminded me a lot of some foreign brands. 

Trunk Space: The trunk space is awesome. The trunk space is as big as a full-size luxury car's. Going on trips is not a problem with the trunk space in this car. 

Performance and Ride: This car's ride is extremely good and very smooth. There are no jutters, bangs or pops. It rides a lot like a good import. Acceleration is very smooth and does not punch you when you accelerate, like so many cars do. The gear ratios are dead-on and the car shifts right at the correct moment, even under extreme conditions. I do wish a little more power was under the hood. It had lots of power but 'ya know you can always use more power. :o) 

Interior Electronics: I didn't like the cruise control. I found it to be very, very touchy but it's really hard to explain. It seemed close to impossible to get the cruise control set to the speed I wanted. When I set it, it accelerated really fast to almost 8 miles over where I set it. My recommendation is to go 8 miles under what you want and then it set it. And if you want to make adjustments, hit "coast" and "accel". This is my only advice to help you use the cruise control. The CD player was good. The sound system was very good with nice highs and very deep lows. I wondered if those were sub woofers in back. It has the typical foreign console design with the gearshift down at the floor and not at the wheel. The console is good but I feel like Dodge could have spent a little more time on its sturdiness and smartness. For example, the drink holders need to be bigger. There need to be more CD holders and a place for sunglasses would have been nice. But still the console is good... just that I think it could have been a little better. It did have automatic headlight turn off. I'm sure you can get more options but mine was a rental. 

Interior Comfort: The front is very comfortable with the seat being elevated and tilted back in the correct position. Both front seats are more than comfortable and make a long road trip comfortable. But the back seats are a little different story. You almost wonder if they forgot about the back seats. They're adequate but I really wouldn't call them comfortable. The seats are too straight -- if they had tilted them back a little it would have been great. The only redeeming quality about the back seats is that you do get used to them after awhile. I wish that the comfort of the front seats was available in the back. 

Reliability: The gear ratios make the car run smooth and quiet, and this should help the car run longer. The low RPMs at highway speeds should make for a longer-lived engine. 

Overall: I think the car is good. The Intrepid is an attempt to get many of the nicer attributes of foreign cars in a domestic model. But Dodge fell just slightly short. I will say that it is one of the biggest full-size cars I have seen, which is a plus to me and a potential reason to buy it if you're on a tight budget and need every bang for the buck. I would probably buy it if I had the money. But for people who are used to compact or mid-size cars, this car will seem quite big to them. I have looked at a lot of full-size cars and I'm convinced this is the biggest of the full size cars.
