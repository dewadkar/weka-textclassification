            THE GOOD: I bought this car 16 months ago and am quite impressed with the whole package.  It is a loaded GS and had a sticker price of $29,495.00.  After cutting my best deal with the dealer, rebates and cashing in my GM MasterCard points, I walked away with this car for $22,400.00 before tax.  This car has better acceleration than the new VW Passat W-8, and it looks so much more classy than the Grand Prix GTP which share the GS' engine.  I simply could not find another sedan for less than $40,000.00 that can do 0-60 in 6.5.  Let me tell you there is no lag with the supercharger like there is with a turbocharger.  Immediate power is on tap the instant you step on the gas.  It takes awhile to get used to the power, especially if you've come off a Toyota Camry / Honda Accord lease.  But it is FUN!  The car seems more substantial than the Camry and Accord, with its large supercharged V-6 and beefy 16" tires and wheels.  Surprisingly with all that power, I get a decent 23 mpg mixed hwy/city driving, and easily get 30+ mpg on a trip.  Keep in mind the GS requires premium fuel.

THE BAD:  I am 6'4" and keep the driver seat all the way back.  There is really no leg room left that way.  Since I am single with no kids, it does not present a problem for me, but it might for some families.  The handling is superb, or at least would be with the right set of tires.  The stock Goodyear Eagles just do not have the grip.  The tires will smoke when you jab the accelerator, even with the traction control on.  When these tires need replacing, I definitely will upgrade and I know the car will handle with the best of the midsize sedans.

THIS CAR IS NOT UGLY: If you are looking for a car to bring back memories of the 60's and early 70's Buick GS musclecars, this is the car.  And you can be proud to take your clients out in it too... very classy styling.
