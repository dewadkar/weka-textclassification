            The MX-2900 offers the best of both worlds: a &quot;camera-manual&quot; mode for serious digital artists, and a &quot;camera-auto&quot; mode for <i>point &amp; shoot</i> connoisseurs in the 2+ megapixel category. 

This is the 4th digital camera I have worked with in the last 5 months.  Previous cameras included an Olympus 400Z, a Ricoh 5300, and an Olympus C2500L.   The Fujifilm MX-2900 zoom is my current favorite in the 2+ megapixel category for it's light/white handling features, color fidelity, and ease of use. 

<b>GADGETS, FEATURES, &amp; WIDGETS I LOVE:</b> 
1) Not only does the MX-2900 offer a pop-up flash, there is a separate shoe that can be used to run a flash attachment.  Running the flash off an independent battery does nice things for the camera's already impressive power usage.
2) Viewing images is a breeze, as is erasing, saving, and adding a few sparkles: just twist the dial to VIEW mode... and press the MENU button.  UP/DOWN and R/L buttons allow you to scroll &amp; scan menu options with ease. 
3) Want to play with depth of field, shutter speed, and white balance?  That's <i>really</i> easy.  Just set the camera mode to MANUAL and turn on the menu. It's all there. 
4) Color fidelity is phenomenal!  I will give a digital camera a tremendous amount of leeway in image quality if the color fidelity is good.  The Fuji's is comparable to the color handling of a decent 35mm SLR print film camera.  After working with digital images for years, I can safely say ... &quot;Wow.&quot;  
5)I was also fond of the ease with which it was possible to swap between the 2 image resolutions and the 4 levels of image quality.  File size, which controls the number of pictures you can store on a smartcard, is affected by both. My guess is that anyone who has difficulties with image quality, hasn't had a chance to explore all the possible levels of picture quality.
6) An ultra simple 10 second timer is the crowning touch.  Twist the dial to the timer mode... press the trigger button... and scurry into place.  

<b>The Downside</b>
Initially I fussed over the absence of a spare battery.  However, the spare was going to run me an extra $62, so I passed.  Since that time, I have come to believe the spare is unnecessary.  In truth, a fully charged battery will last you through as many pictures, erasures, flashes, and tweaking as you desire during the average four hour &quot;outing&quot;.  In fact, you are far more likely to run out of room on the <i>smartcard</i> than you are battery power.  Now <i>that's</i> a trade-off I can live with! 

<b>Pleasant Surprises</b>
It's a breeze to display pictures from the camera to your television.  (and after seeing pictures on my 27&quot; TV, I'm wondering what they'd  look like on a big screen) I plugged the cable provided into the camera and the VCR, pressed all the appropriate power buttons, and that was all it took. 

Downloading software is also easy to install and use.  All this for under $1000 is a bargain.  For less than $800?  This one is a keeper!
