            I originally bought my Shadow because it looked like a fun car and it was the nicest on the lot.Now I've had it for about 2 years and it's still very reliable.I did have to replace the timing belt a few months after I bought the car but other then that,it's been pretty good to me.But I have found that when I put the top down that it's hard to latch it down to hold it in place.And I found on a website that the car has recalls and some were things that I've noticed but that weren't really major problems.One thing was the paint.It chips a little on the hood but it's not too much of an eyesore.Also,the steering column squeaks and the windows are hard to roll up.My driver's side window just quit and I had to pay $90 to have it repaired.Maybe I'll get Chrysler to pay for repairing the recalls.I don't know.But until then,I'll just enjoy it while I got it.
