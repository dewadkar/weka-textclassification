            I can't specifically address the 2000 Mazda Protege, but I bought a '95 Protege and will give you some insight into the car and the service from the dealership.

I have 300K kilometres -- (yes, I'm Canadian) -- on my car and it has yet to give me any serious problems.  The motor is in A1 condition.  All cylinders registering very good compression.  I have a manual transmission and I'm still on the original clutch.  Isn't that amazing!  I have had to change my radiator, muffler, and struts.  One complaint is that Mazda parts are very EXPENSIVE.  So, when something does breakdown, it is not cheap to fix.  For example, my radiator cost CDN$650.00.  That was simply the cost of the radiator, not the labour to re+re.  The muffler was not expensive, but it shouldn't be anyway.  

Yes, I would buy another Mazda product.  Before my Protege I had a Mazda 323 and it gave me the same kind of reliability.  I can't say anything more about these cars.  They're great.  The downside is the cost of replacing Mazda parts with OEM parts.  They are not cheap.  Luckily for me, no major repairs yet, but with 300K on the vehicle you know that something is bound to go sooner or later.
