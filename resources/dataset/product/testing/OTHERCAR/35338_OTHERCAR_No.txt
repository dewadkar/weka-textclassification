            We bought this car because it was the best looking and riding of the minivans.  It still is, when it is running.  In the first 3 years it broke down and left my wife stranded 5 different times.  Once in the middle of the Mojave desert in June.  It has been in the shop for repairs or needed to be, nearly monthly for the 3 years we owned it.  It got so bad that we waited until something serious went wrong and then gave the dealer a list of the little items to fix at the same time.
It needed a new battery every August, like clock work.  The dealer told us, &quot;that is the way it is with cars that have electronic features&quot;.  Funny this doesn't happen with our other vehicles.  Also the dealer said we should buy good batteries since MoPar batteries are not reliable.  
Fortunately, we purchased the extended warranty so the repairs cost us very little, but the inconvenience and headaches were maddening. 
Some of the more significant repairs included a wiper controller on 4 different occasions, new water pump, new radiator, three brake jobs, three batteries, new arm rests, 4 trips to the dealer for a leaking rear door, etc.  All of this on a car that was less than three years old and had less than 50,000 miles.  Interestingly consumer reports now rates this as one of the most reliable minivans, that's why I have never paid much attention to Consumer Reports.

The service from the Chrysler dealer was terrible.  They practically accused my wife of lying every time she complained about the car.  The service reps were rude and the sales man lied to us about loaner cars.

If you are looking for the best riding and best looking minivan and don't care about reliability and frequency of repairs, this is the vehicle for you. Be sure to get the extended warranty, you'll need it. 
 
By the way, we traded the T&amp;C in on a 2000 Ford Excursion last week.  Having never owned anything but GM products I can safely say I will never own another Chrysler product, including Dodge and Plymouth.  Now I hope I haven't made the same mistake buying a Ford, only time will tale. I can't blame this purchase on my wife.<br><br>
