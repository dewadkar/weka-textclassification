            This vehicle is a good buy because it is so low on gas. As I have a Buick Le Sabre Custom and the gas is so high now I got that car from my dad. It is so easy to work on. 
Other than the buick I can do more engine work.
If you are low on money and need a car who runs and brings you from A to B than that is the right car. I like the luxury of my big Buick, but the gas milage on my little Colt.
I changed the oil and see there this car doesn't burn oil anymore. How did I manage that? I put a secrete fluid in it. 
This car has a 1.5 liter engine 5 manual what is very adiquate for my needs. And it is not so boring than driving a automatic.
The shocks of course which are still the original are with 150000 miles not that good anymore, but better than walking.
I drove with this car from Oklahoma to Louisianna and to Colorado, California. It was a ride we enjoyed and we were 3 adults and two children. No backpain at all with my 6'2.
