            In January 98 I helped my sister select a new used car. The car that she ended up picking was a 97 Tracer with around 30,000 miles on it. The Tracer had a lower price tag than several other cars on the lot that had more miles on them and were older. In 97 Ford redesigned the Tracer replacing the engine, which was a 1.9 liter, with a brand new 2 liter engine. The 1.9 engine that had been in the Tracer before 97 was one of the worst engines that ford produced. It had very poor performance, and over all was a very weak engine. The new 2 liter engine that took its place on the other hand has a very good power curve. It is also a very reliable engine. Since my sister has gotten the car she has not had any problems with the engine. The only time that she has had to have the car in the shop other than regular maintenance was when she had a blow out. The car has very good styling inside and out. The interior is very well laid out and the seats are very comfortable. The paint job on the car has held up very well. This car is very well priced for what you get.<br><br>
