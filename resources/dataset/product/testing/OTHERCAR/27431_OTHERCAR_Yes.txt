            I purchased my 95 Dodge Neon in November of 1994.  I bought the car because it handled better and accelerated faster than the other cars in its class.  At the time of my purchase, the DOHC engine was not available, nor were power windows.  I did, get everything else on the car that was available other than a CD player.  The Sport model came with 4 wheel anti-lock disk brakes and a stiffer suspension for better handling.  

I still own this car.  It now has 87,000 miles on it and I have found it to be an excellent car.  The only major problem I had was an oil leak that developed at about 40,000 miles.  The dealer told me that the head gasket was leaking and that they were going to have to replace the head.  I couldn't believe this.  I asked more questions and found that there was a design flaw in the 95 neon's (and maybe some 96's also) that caused the head gasket to start leaking between 40K and 50K miles.

Fortunately I had the extended warranty and therefore the $1500 repair cost me $50.  I was pretty depressed after that and, combined with some other minor problems I had, I began to wonder if I had made a wise purchase.  But since that time I have done nothing to the car other than new tires and routine maintenance.   The car still looks very nice, runs great and gets 30 mpg. (which is important with gas prices where they are!!)

A growing family will keep me from ever buying another Neon, but for a single person or a couple, I highly recommend this sporty little vehicle.<br><br>
