            I decided it would be a good idea and step into the 21st century and purchase one of these new fangled digital camera thingys and this truly is the best camera for your
money.  

First it has optical zoom standard, Unlike the DX3500.  This improves image quality when you need to zoom in on a face or small object.  Digital zoom on this camera along with any digital camera is crappy, or so I have been told.   So, spend the extra cash and get the 3600 as opposed to the 3500.  

The flash works great, will turn any dark corner into daytime.  Flash can be a little overpowering at times.  

The size of camera is also handy and will fit in the pocket of your cargo pants or use the wrist strap that is included and loop in around your belt, handy to have close by for those "Kodak Moments." 

The video feature is handy on this camera, nice to catch a quick video when you don't have the video cam handy, or if you know that you are going to email the clip.  (The videos are it Quicktime format) Don't plan on using the cam to record the kids whole school play however, as the videos do include audio, and the longer videos will eat your memory and batteries.  

Software on the camera and computer is very easy to navigate and with built in driver support included with Windows XP, this makes installation a snap.  You don't really have to install the software if you have XP, but for all the features to be available (i.e. deleting pics from the cam via windows explorer) you have to install the kodak software.  

Another thing this camera has is the ability to display images on a TV, this is very handy for showing Grandma pictures of the fam, the cable for this function is included.  

Overall I love my camera, and would recommend it to anyone just starting in digital photography.  A word of warning:  Get the dock with rechargable Ni-Mh batteries or the Travel Kit that Kodak makes for DX series (which includes the rechargable batteries and quick charger.) I also recommend the travel kit as it comes with a case that is good sized for housing the camera, charger, cables and accessories. Any other brand of batteries or charger is a waste of time.  I learned this the hard way...  

Also pick up a chunk of CompactFlash (I got 64MB) this makes storage a non-issue especally if you won't be close to a computer for a while.  I get about 100 images in high quality, 400 in good with my 64MB card.  Should be good for a vacation or two...
