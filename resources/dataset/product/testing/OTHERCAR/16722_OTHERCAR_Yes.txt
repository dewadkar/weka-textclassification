            Well my husband and I decided to buy a mini van. We were told by everyone and their brother not to buy a dodge minivan but guess what...we did today.My husbands father is a mechanic and so is my husbands best friend.They all told him not to buy one because ALL of their cars are &quot;junk&quot; &quot;If some thing needs to be replaced &quot;it'll cost you a fortune&quot; Well with our budget, a 1993 dodge caravan looks great, runs nice,and for $3,700 including tax and title we were sucked in. It's red( I LOVE RED!)and its not too big.Well we go pick it up monday, and I'm scared now I haven't heard a single good thing yet.Doesnt anyone out there have a caravan with out major malfunctions?  p.s.I wanted the red caravan, my husband wanted the chevy astrovan guess who won that one... ;o ) <br><br>
