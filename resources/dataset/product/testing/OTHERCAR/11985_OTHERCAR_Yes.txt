            After finding out that my wife is expecting TWINS, I realized that I cannot have the better part of my family riding around town in the Honda Civic that she's had since college.  Time to grow up, slap down the cash and buy a new(er) car.  Being the kind of person who would rather buy the best product from 7 years ago than the mid priced crap on the road today, I went with the Toyota Landcruisers.

This truck is the real deal.  Not only is it reliable but can haul around 7 (small) people at the same time.  There is the station wagon utility.  It also can go just about anywhere you would normally brush off as impassible in most verhicles.  There's the big truck utility.  She cleans up pretty good too...ready for a evening in the city.  Luxury car utility.  One of the only problems is that it lacks the small Honda car utility of using a coffee straw to suck down the gas.  This monster uses those big Quickie Mart 64 oz. straws!!  I've got it currently at 14mpg...whew

There is another detail that concerned me.  Airbags were not an option until 95 and standard until 96.  I rationalized getting the 94 because the kiddies are not to sit in the front seat until they are 8 yrs old, or so I have read.  By then, I'll probably have gotten a 98 or 99...when the price comes down.  Prices are high for these beasts...the 98 I was looking at had 50k miles and they were asking close to 40k.  That's a lot of cash.  Luckily I was able to find my 94 with higher miles for 14.2k out the door.

Over all I have had nothing but great experiences with this truck.  I have yet to take it to the snow or on some really bumpy trails near my uncles house in Nevada, but I have trucked through some sloppy mud near my house and she handled just fine.  I also bought some peace of mind when I purchased this truck.  Knowing that my wife and childrens are in a big Heavy vehicle which will protect them in an accident...god forbid.  And hey...it's a Toyota!  My 78 celica had 324,000 miles on it before I sold it, so it should run a good long time.
