            I've always wanted to own a 318 ti. I just love the sporty hatchback design so when my husband received a pre-approved auto loan from our credit union, we went to shop for one. We went to Cunningham BMW (which is a very good dealership)...no pressure and very friendly. We saw one white 318 ti which was the manager's service car.It has 12K miles on it and it has a moon roof which added to its beauty. I have small kids so the legroom
in the back serves no problem. We changed the battery once (boy..it was expensive) and the tires. The rear window wiper motor is having some problems...so I think it's almost time to change that part...which I think will be expensive. I usually just drive it to and from work. The uphill climb is no problem for the 318. And the gas mileage is pretty decent. The air conditioning is good,too. <br><br>
