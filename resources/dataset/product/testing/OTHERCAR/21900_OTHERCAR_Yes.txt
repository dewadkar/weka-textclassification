            I love this car.  I don't own it, but I had the pleasure of driving a 540iA during the Ultimate Drive, which is put on by BMW.  For 45 glorious minutes I piloted this beast.  The car looks very nice, although it is pretty common place among the luxury cars of the world because it is so good.  As a result, it's handsome appearance is often overlooked.  I think that this is one of the few cars that one could own forever.  It seems to do everything very well.  If it had the optional six-speed I would have seriously thought about not bringing the car back.  I would love to be a fugative in this baby.  This car is all about brute speed.  It looks harmless but when you get on the gas your face and every visceral organ is tighly pressed against the seat.  At the same time, the car was ultra quiet and very composed.  What you can hear is the engine which was quite muted.  It almost sounded like an electric car.  This would be my only complaint.  I love the sound of German engines espeically the big ones.  However, I think I can deal.  However, when driving normally the car is a dream.  It has wonderful seeat, very communicative steering and is just a wonderfully engineered machine.  It is so good that I can't imagine how any future generations can improve upon this model.  Ok, I have to admit that the M5 is probably better, but it is all about what you want.  This car with a 6-speed would be soooo amazing.  Inside of the car, the size is similar to a huge American car, but the handling makes one think they are in a much smaller Z3.  While the M5 is probably a magnificant machine, I don't know of many people who would be upset with just the plain 540.  It is such a nice car.<br><br>
