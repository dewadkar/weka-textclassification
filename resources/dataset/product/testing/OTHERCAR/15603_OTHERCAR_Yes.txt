            I am a fair weekend photographer, but had no experience with digital photography. The main attraction of the FD-91 was the floppy disk storage system.  To be able to take large quantities of pictures without taking out a mortgage was tempting.

I bought my FD-91 through an Ebay user that had one for sale and had seen my name on the bid lists. The sites warn about this kind of purchase, but the person was very upfront and honest, and agreed to ship COD. The purchase price was 670.00 including overnight Fedex and COD fees.  The camera had been opened, but never used.

Straight out of the box, I was able to take some great photos.  Right now, the majority of my pictures are of my daughter's drill team.  I can get high quality photos from 50-75 yards range.  At this range, they are grainy when enlarged to 8x10 size, but the 5x7s are great.  I don't take the time to adjust the many variable settings (white balance, exposure time, ISO, etc.) but tend to just snap.  The only feature I have trouble with is that the camera writes each picture to the disk and there is a 2-3 second delay between shots.  In addition to the great long distance shots, this camera can also take a macro shot as close as 1&quot; to the lens. 
The auto-focus works quickly and accurately and the steady-shot feature eliminates any &quot;shake&quot; from the pictures, even at extreme range. The video feature is surprisingly handy. You have the ability to take regular still pictures, stills with 5 seconds of verbal notations (great for work, or just notetaking, or surprising grandma with an &quot;Luv you!&quot;) or a video function.  You do have to make a choice between 60 seconds of fair quality video or 15 seconds of good quality.  It doesn't replace a camcorder, but to catch those wonderful memories without having to carry a camera AND a camcorder is great.    

I strongly recommend this camera to anyone that is interested in getting into digital photography.  With a little patience and judicious web shopping, this camera is a great deal.  Get the upgrade battery (NP-550) and keep one in the charger at all times and you'll never have a reason not to get &quot;the shot&quot; again.  <br><br>
