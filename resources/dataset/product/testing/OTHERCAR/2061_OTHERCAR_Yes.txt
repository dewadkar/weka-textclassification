            I bought this camera because I'm on a tight budget, yet I needed a digital camera to take decent photos for my webpage and for my scrapbooking hobby.  I was going to buy the CL18 because I read rave reviews on it and even saw someone's online photo album which had really nice pics taken with this camera.  The CL 20 had just come out on the market, and it was only a few dollars more and had the LCD screen so I went for that one.<b>

NOTE:  you can't see the image you're photographing on the LCD screen. It just tells you the following:  how many pics left, flash or no flash, battery level, that sort of thing.<b>

What I do like:  It is small and compact - fits in a pocket.    It comes with the case, a mounter to use it as a webcam, the USB cable, 2 cheap batteries, and a handstrap.  <b>

Agfa has excellent and responsive customer support - they will replace your camera if it malfunctions according to their warranty. <b>

This camera accepts CompactFlash cards. <b>

The image quality is wonderful if taken outdoors and taken at highest resolution.<b>

Indoor pics are trickier.  Using the flash indoors is tricky, too.  Make sure your image is in the right range: otherwise, too close and your pics will have a 'whiteout' effect.  Indoor pics without a flash sometimes work. <b> 

I had to experiment using the camera indoors using all light conditions and most times I use the PhotoGenie Quick Fix and sometimes even Photoshop to get the image I need.<b>  

You'll get nice images at 4x6, maybe even 5x7, but not any bigger.<b>

What I don't like:  Goes thru batteries like nothing.  I mean it REALLY drains batteries fast.  I've had it for 6 weeks and already I've gone thru 12 batteries.<b>

The Agfa website just recently recommended using Duracell Ultra batteries or Ni-Cad rechargable batteries. <b>

Also, this camera is NOT rugged at all.  It's on the delicate side and should be in a cushy camera case when not in use. 

Hope this is helpful to someone.
