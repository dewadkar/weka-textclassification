            Considering all the trucks I've seen, this one is pretty much mediocre.  It holds up pretty good compared to the 4wd version, which is a little better for hauling things and driving in bad weather, but also more expensive.

I came across this truck back in December '99, when I had a lot of junk piled up and needed to haul it to the dump.  I new a couple of people who owned trucks, but I asked the man who owned the Nissan Frontier first.  He agreed to help me out as long as I promised to put a tarp down to prevent damage to the superb paint job.

My driving experience went well.  The truck didn't exactly hug corners as I was hoping compared to a few cars I've driven, but it seemed to be able to keep on the road after some getting used to.  I was also driving a stick shift which didn't give me any problems in the time I drove it.  I felt a little different being up so high in the truck, but I suppose that would also take some getting used to because it has larger tires than most other cars.

Recently I asked my buddy about any problems he'd been having with the truck.  He says pretty much everything's been fine since he bought it, but he had a little bit of a problem with the radiator leaking.  He is unaware of what caused it.  He was on a road trip and when he parked to eat their was a puddle under his car after he returned.  He felt this shouldn't have happened so soon, because the truck was only up to 90,000 miles.  He also mentioned that the gas mileage was pretty good compared to most trucks (considering the bed is empty).

If you need a nice stylish truck, this one is at least worth looking into.  If your in need of a truck that has beauty on the inside, you might want to try looking elsewhere.  I also recommend looking into the 4WD version which is very similar if not identical.<br><br>
