            This message refers to 1999 Toyota Tacoma 4X4 Xtracab Limited.  I bought this truck because I was willing to pay extra for a well built vehicle.  It was pretty pricey for a truck this size, but what do you expect from Toyota.  One week after my purchase, I began to have problems with steering wheel &quot;shimmey&quot;.  After six or seven attempts, the dealer could not fix it.  
I bought the truck in the winter.  When summer came around, I noticed that the AC didn't have much effect cooling the truck.  At best, it can get the temperature down to 80 in the cab.  The dealer tried to deny the problem.  After a lot of talking, they finally admitted that it might have a problem with AC.  They have tried several remedies, but none have really fixed the problem.  Additionally, the dashboard rattles now because they have done so much work behind it.  
The drive train on the vehicle had slack in it.  It is a 4X4 and I have never gotten to take it off road.  The dealer has fixed the slack in the drive train, but broke the rear differential in the process.  The rear differential had to be completely replaced.  This is at around 10000 miles.  The drive train seems OK at 14k miles, but I am not very comfortable with having multiple drive train repairs within the first year of ownership.  
I contacted the company about the problems, and it turns out that I have to pursue them in court in order to get anything done about it.  I am an engineer and I really don't have time for court, but I have to go unless I am willing to accept this vehicle for my $26k.  
I would be careful about buying from Toyota.  I don't think that Toyotas are worth the extra money that you have to pay for them.  My recommendation, buy from a less expensive Japanese manufacturer.  You don't get anything extra for the high price of Toyotas.  Especially not from the service department.      <br><br>
