            There is a lot to like about the 928, but my mistake was to buy it as a daily driver in a city with congested traffic. I drove an '86 5-speed 928S in Seattle for about 1.5 years. I had never owned a serious sports car before, and after much research I was attracted to the 928's great value, great handling, performance, luxurious comfort, and relatively practical layout. Also its timeless, otherworldly, eccentric beauty.

What I found is that the 928 is a lot of fun above 90 mph, but I wasn't there very often. In heavy city traffic, its tall gearing gave it a sluggish feel, and it's great width (much wider than it appears), combined with its rounded shape and high sills, made it very difficult to tell how close it was to other cars and objects. I had to be so cautious in the city that it just wasn't very fun to drive. If you're looking for a nimble, agile, "tossable" city driver, the 928 is not going to be your cup of tea.

One of the most remarkable features of the 928 is the combination of relatively smooth ride and great handling. It smooths bumps almost like a luxury car yet takes corners like a sports car. 

Other considerations:

The 5-speed is a royal pain to shift. Before driving this car I would never have considered an automatic for a daily driver. But I found myself often wishing mine was an automatic. At first I figured I would adjust to it with time. I was able to adjust to it a little bit, but never nearly enough. Unless you're planning on racing your 928 at the track, you should seriously consider getting an automatic, even if you never would have considered one before. An added bonus to the automatic is that the sluggishness around town would seem less of an issue. Note, the shifter was much improved on the GTS.

The air dam on the 928S, along with its brackets, breaks very easily and the parts are very expensive. Approach all driveways at an angle and slowly, and never get close to a parking lot curb. Consider getting an '87 or later, which does not have an air dam.

It's too wide, and the doors too thick, for compact parking spaces. If someone parks next to you in a compact parking space, you may have to get in through the passenger door and crawl over the center tunnel. If someone parks on your passenger side too, you may have to crawl in through the hatch. Let me assure you that this is not fun. I haven't compared the numbers myself, but I recall reading that the 928 is about as wide as a Chevrolet Suburban. But the Suburban has higher, thinner doors, and so is easier to get in and out.

Even under normal conditions parked in standard parking spaces, you'll typically have to contort yourself awkwardly to get in without scratching the adjacent car. As you might guess, this did not endear the car to my girlfriend. I often had to let her out before pulling into a parking space, then pull out of of the parking space before letting her in. This is not the way to impress a girl, know what I mean?

So imagine this scenario, guys. You're taking a great girl out on a first date. At first she admires your beautiful 928. When you arrive at the restaurant, she accidentally smacks the door against the adjacent car -- the door is so thick she didn't realize how close the outer edge was to the adjacent car. She starts crying and apologizing profusely. You assure her you don't mind, and leave a note on the other car offering to pay for the ding. Getting back in, you hear her grunt trying to slide in as you hold the door open as wide as possible, one finger between the door and the adjacent car. At your destination after dinner, only compact spaces are open, and you have to let her out before parking. When you get back, someone has parked too close so you have to crawl in through the passenger side (or worse, the hatch), then pull out to let her in. After a few dates, she starts suggesting that you drive her Toyota Corolla and leave your Porsche parked at her place. Are you feeling suave yet?

The automatic door locks are very noisy and slow. You'll think something must be wrong with them, but it's normal. They're silly and embarrassing by today's standards.

The maintenance costs are in the stratosphere. Be prepared for $2 - $5K a year or more. I knew maintenance costs would be high, but not that high. The 928 is not a good value once you consider the maintenance costs.

You've probably read elsewhere about the myriad electrical problems. Be prepared to live with things that don't work properly, or to spend a ton of dough replacing very expensive electronics. And then replacing the same damn parts again and again.

But for all that, I still adore 928s. Someday if I'm making a lot more money and have a lot more parking space, maybe I'll pick up a GTS (or an '87 or later automatic) as an occasional cruising car.

Due to a recent house purchase I'm back to driving my '87 Honda CRX Si, but when finances once again permit a luxury GT, I'll choose one built more for city streets than for the track. I'm considering a Lexus SC300 and a Honda Prelude. But I haven't entirely ruled out a Porsche 968. I'd be interested in the Boxter, too, if it was available as a coupe. 

In summary, buy a 928 to cruise highways or open roads, or to race at the track. Don't buy it as a daily driver in a city with heavy traffic. Unless you're planning on racing it, get an automatic (or cough up the extra dough for a GTS). Don't get one with an air dam. And don't buy it because it seems like a great value, because once you start paying the maintenance costs, you'll realize it's not.
