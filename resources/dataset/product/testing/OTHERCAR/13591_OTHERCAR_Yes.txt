            Everyone has a devilish side. that part of you that just wants to throw caution to the wind and let yourself be free. The Mazda Miata is the car that turns that side loose. From the beginning I have drooled over photo's of this auto in magazines and test drove them in the car lots. Imagine my joy when I was stumbled across a beautiful red one with VERY few miles and in mint condition. 

Now I had driven these cars before, but its not until you own one that you truly appreciate the eye popping style and handling this car offers. It was a pure pleasure to drive. The Miata turns on a dime and the acceleration is so responsive you would swear it could read your mind. There are few rattles or pings and the ride is enjoyable even with the top down and freeway speeds. Eventually the car had to leave my life. There is just enough room for a single man and when I started my family, it was my wife or the car. Belive me I made the right choice. 

The Miata is and affordable, exciting car. If I were ever to stumble upon another I would look long and hard before I walked away. This truly is a beautiful Automobile. <br><br>
