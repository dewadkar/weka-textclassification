            Mercury has really made a good quality product with this car. In contrast to the one disapproval of this car by another epinion's writer. I found it perfect for the money. 

This car is a great buy if you are in the market for a realistically priced sports car. I have owned a Cougar for 4 months now and am I true believer that you will not find a car that handles and negotiates corners and turns like this car (Unless you are willing to pay $40,000 plus. In addition the 2001 model has improved on the years past by improving their seats, which now are really comfortable. The pickup off the line is great for the 2.5 Duratec V6 under the hood.

However there are some Cons to the car, and that all depends on what kind of car you are looking for. If you are looking for a sports car then this is a great car for the money. The small backseat and firm ride are all not much of an issue when it comes down to the characteristics of a sports car. On the other hand if you are looking for a family/sports sedan then this car is not for you. First off the ride quality is not that of a family sedan. the suspension is very tight and responsive, typical of sport car set-ups. Secondly the backseat is not the greatest for anybody who has to be sitting back there.

It all truly depends on what you need the car for, and your preference. If you as used to the "floating on air" feeling with room for you and your friends/family, then this is not a good choice for you. But If you like a car to be nimble and responsive like a sports car, but don't want to spend the big dollars that come with the more high end cars then this is the ideal choice!
