            When I had the task before me of buying a new car, I shopped around. I looked at several makes and brands, and nothing really struck my fancy.  A friend of mine had been a Saturn owner for 3 years, and urged me to go to the dealership and look at the new SC2. When I walked in, I fell in love with the car just on looks. It looked to sleek and new in the showroom. The interior was equally comfortable, beautiful leather and a great system.  It didn't take long to convince me. I walked out of there that day the owner of a new SC2.

As it happened, a year later, I was driving on US Route 80 at about 1 am, coming back from a concert, when 2 deer suddenly leapt in the road in front of the car. One hit the hood, then the windshield and flipped over the roof, and the second went under the car. The airbag went off, and my nose was broken, but that was the extent of my injuries.  The car was nearly totalled, but I was alive.  The windshield was strong enough to propel the animal over the roof, so I wasn't hurt by it. Eventually, the car was fixed, but looked like new... the body specialist told me it was one of his best works :-)

Two months ago, my lease was up on the SC2, and I happily bought it.  I will be with this car for many years to come. I had almost no problems with it, and I still think it looks great!<br><br>
