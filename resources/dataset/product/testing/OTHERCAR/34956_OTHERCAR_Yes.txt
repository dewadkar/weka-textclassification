            I've had my 2000 Grand Prix GT for 8 months now and still love winding it out on curvy roads out in the country. This is a beautiful, powerful looking car that gets heads turning as you glide on by...
The Grand Prix is a great family car with enough room for the kids and all of their gear. But it's also a great, growly muscle car (especially in the GRP trim) that can sit you back in your seat and power its way around curves and over rises.

My only complaint is that the seats don't have enough lumbar support. Why design a car that can go fast around corners and then neglect support for your legs?

I've had two small problems with the car. The right rear tail light developed a small leak, allowing some water to get in during hard rains and car washing. Recently the external temperature gauge stopped working properly which makes the auto setting for AC/heating function incorrectly.
Both problems were fixed quickly by my local dealership.

I was loath to buy a minivan, and looked at every sedan and SUV on the market before getting the Grand Prix. Decided to go to a  domestic sedan after years of owning Mazdas and Volkswagons. Almost went foreign and bought a Nissan Xterra, but the lack of negotiating room, and having to wait for the vehicle sent me back to Pontiac and I'm very happy with my choice.

I paid just over $27,0000 Canadian ($18,000 US) for a &quot;Bronze Mist&quot; GT model with dual temp control, polished steel wheels, overhead console, and their most powerful CD/radio option.
