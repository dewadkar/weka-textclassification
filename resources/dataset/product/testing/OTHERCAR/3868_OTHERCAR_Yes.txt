            This past summer my husband and I decided it was time to get a minivan. We are a military family with three kids and we truly need a vehicle that is going to suit our needs. We chose this van for many reasons.

<b>1)Cost</b>: We purchased the basic van and even though we do not have all the ammenities that we would love, I am satisfied with the $13,500 we paid. We looked at many other makes and models and even for a basic van I feel we got a great deal.

<b>2)Comfort</b>: After test driving many vans this one drove wonderfully. It is smooth riding and very comfortable.

<b>3)Two power outlets</b>: I absolutely love this feature. As soon as we seen the two outlets and decided on the van we went straight to the store. We purchased a VCP and a mini TV. We use the outlet in the rear for the TV and the one in the front for the VCP. We chose a VCP over a VCR because we knew we would not be recording anything.

<b>4)Rear winshield wiper</b>: I hate driving in the rain especially when I can not see. This feature makes for safer driving. I love being able to see so clear in front and back while driving.

<b>5)Removable seats</b>: Both middle and back seats can be removed. This is great for getting those big items home. I have taken these seats out and they are very easy to remove. 

<b>6)Style</b>: I did not want a van that looked like a bus. I love the rounded back end of this van. It is very stylish for a minivan.

<b>7)More room</b>: Including the driver and passenger seat this van seats 7. We have already made a long trip and it was the most comfortable trip we have made in along time. Two of my children sat way in the back watching TV while my youngest daughter sat in the middle seat all alone. It was quiet and she was able to sleep. This van makes our trips more relaxing.

I am happy with my <b>1999 Plymouth Voyager</b>. The only feature I miss that my old car had is pick up. This van is only a 4 cylinder. We do not plan on pulling any trailers so we are in the clear here. I am very satisfied and plan on keeping this van for a long time. Like my daughter says I am now driving <i>The mom mobile</i>.<br><br>
