              As a junior in high school, my father and i decided it was time for me to own a car. Since we had planned on spending no more than $10,000, the Neon fit perfectly into our budget.  We decided upon a two-door Highline Coupe. 
  The interior of the car is quite roomy. I can fit easily and comfortably into the drivers seat despite my 6'2 frame. Front seat passengers enjoy a large amount of room as well. The back seat is also quite spacious, even with the front seats all the way back. At one time , I was able to fit myself and six college aged friends into the car. 
  The gas mileage is about average for a compact car. I got around 28 mpg, using regular unleaded fuel.  The car is a great commuter, and handles its mileage well. I put 50,000 miles on the car in two years, and had it into the shop once in that time (at 30,000mi, the head gasket was leaking) 
  The factory speakers are pretty impressive as well. With my cd player pumping out techno beats, the car would rumble so much that my rear view mirrors would vibrate. This was with the bass all the way up of course. 
 For a first car, i would recommend a Neon to anyone.  Its an affordable, quality compact car, that can withstand huge amounts of psycho teenage driving.<br><br>
