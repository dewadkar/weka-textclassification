               See that silver car in the picture?  That's my car.  Sure, mine's a little dirtier.  And it's got slightly more wear.  But still, same make, model, color, and everything.  And it's beautiful, don't you think?

   I do.  I admit, I probably don't appreciate it as much as if I had saved up the money for it myself.  My parents bought it for me, for Christmas.  But I do adore it.  And I think I appreciate it.  Yes, I believe I do.  And not just because it was the best gift (not including unconditional love and support and all that) that my parents ever gave me.  Because it is a GREAT car.  It is visually pleasing, it runs well, it hasn't broken down after more than 1000 miles (maybe that's not a lot of miles to some people, but this IS my first car.), and, most of all, it can carry 4 friends!

   This is the perfect car for a teenager.  It holds 5 people, including the driver, (but I think you could fit more, if you saw fit to do so); it has low mileage, perfect for the poor teen with a minimum wage job; it is reliable and breaks down rarely, if ever; and it is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

   I admit that there are more beautiful cars out there.  One, for example, is my dad's car.  It's a Jaguar XK8.  It is REALLY a thing of beauty and a joy forever.  Sleek and pretty, a joy to drive, wonderful shocks, and speeds I've never reached in my little Civic.  But not everyone can have a Jag.  For example, I can't.  Like I could afford that.  I can barely afford college loans, and they won't catch up with me for four years!  But I've gone off the topic.

   Although the Civic is not or everyone, it is the car for me.  Still, it has it's faults, like any other car.  It is sort of small, in the driver's seat and the other seats, especially for people large in girth or height.  The backseat doesn't have much legroom.  Also, it has a slight difficulty reaching high speeds.  It will go to 60 and 70 and 80, but it has 'issues' getting there.  For example, where another car would take 6 seconds to accelerate from 40 to 60, mine takes about a minute.  Not a big fault, in my book.  Also, it's suspension and shocks are not the best.  It is sort of a rocky ride on the freeway.  But it'll get you there.  And, keep in mind, I'm comparing it to a JAG in the suspension department.  It's hard for any car to match it, much less a Civic.

   Along with it's faults, the Civic has many good qualities.  It is small and thus can fit into tiny parking spaces.  It is resilient.  You can hit things with it and not get a scratch (or, at least, only a small and barely noticeable scratch).  It also has a spacious trunk.  There's rooms for at least 4 or 5 suitcases.  Or a full-grown man or woman.  But that's another story.  Actually, you could probably fit around 3 grown people in the trunk....

   So, all in all, the Civic is a good, sensible car.  It has a huge trunk space, it gets GREAT gas mileage, it fits 5 people with little effort, and it can fit in very small parking spaces.  However, it is not a sport's car.  It's not a car for a speed demon.  And, hey, let's face it, it's not going to win the Indy 500 any time soon.  Still, I do love my little car.  You might too.
