            Everyone knows that 95% of all SUVs are used for on-road purposes, typically to go to the grocery store, the mall, hauling the kids to school and their activities, commuting to work, and roadtrips. So why is it that Motor Trend and a small collection of other journalists and critics manage to single out any SUV that can't negotiate outrageously-steep off-road inclines/declines, boulders, tree trunks, and rivers? People who buy SUVs don't care. If it looks tough enough, thats all that matters. And if it drives like a car, all the better.

That is the winning philosophy behind the ML55. Mercedes is smart enough to know that most owners of any M-Class won't need to drive through rugged terrain best suited to Range Rovers and Hummers. ML owners want the SUV ride height and commanding view of the road that comes with it. They also want four wheel drive for safe driving on rain-soaked/snow-covered roads. And the ability to drive on some off-road unpaved passages to get to the equestrian trails or favorite fishing lake/stream. The ML320 and ML430 meet these requirements, along with the usual Mercedes conveniences and luxuries. But the ML55 goes much further by offering the company's potent 5.5-liter 5439cc V8 engine, producing 342 horsepower at 5500 rpm and 376 ft-lb of torque at 3000 rpm. The ML55 can accelerate from 0-to-60 mph in 6.8 seconds, and top out at 141 mph. Fuel consumption is just 1 mpg less than the ML430 at 14 mpg city and 18 mpg highway, with a fuel tank capacity of 24.6 gallons. Impressive numbers for a 4913 lb SUV.

Just don't expect the ML55 to drive like an E55. The ML55 is still an SUV with a high center of gravity, so it will never corner like something that is lower to the ground than it. What the ML55 does offer is supreme straight-line acceleration best exploited in highway driving situations, as well as the autobahn-ready high speed touring capability. And since most SUVs are found in these situations, what better acclaim than &quot;best real world SUV on earth&quot;? It may not have the country club cache or safari respect as a Range Rover 4.6 HSE, but like other AMG Mercedes products, the ML55 doesn't scream &quot;look at me&quot; but rather &quot;I can do 140 mph all day long without breaking a sweat.&quot;

My criticisms of the ML55 are very minor. The factory-spec Dunlop SP Sport 9000 tires are too biased towards dry condition driving, and won't perform well in snow and mud. A set of Pirelli Scorpion Zero tires would be much more suited to the ML55, as these tires are intended for both high-speed dry pavement and snow/mud conditions. Mercedes chose to move the ML55's full size spare tire from the ML's undercarriage into the rear cargo area, seriously cutting down the usable cargo space. This decision was motivated by the ML55's sport exhaust, but I think Mercedes should have either found a way to incorporate the spare underneath the cargo floor, or just delete the spare and equip the ML55 with a can of SprayFix for emergencies. I also dislike the mandatory charcoal colored interior. The new-for-2000 Java interior in the ML320/ML430 is much more luxurious looking and brightens-up the entire cabin space. There ought to be a way for Mercedes to accent the standard Java color scheme with AMG sport touches, without having to resort to an all-black interior.

Lastly, and somewhat controversial from a marketing perspective, Mercedes should offer all of the ML55's cosmetic components (front bumper with integrated fog lights, flared wheel arches, 18-inch wheels/tires, side skirts, rear bumper with integrated dual chrome exhaust tips) as options on the ML320 and ML430. The ML55 look is very muscular, but at $26,000 more than a typically-equipped ML320, the premium price will restrict this model to very few buyers. A reasonably-priced Sport Package with the above-mentioned components would allow ML320/ML430 owners to achieve a more muscular look from their bargain-priced models.<br><br>
