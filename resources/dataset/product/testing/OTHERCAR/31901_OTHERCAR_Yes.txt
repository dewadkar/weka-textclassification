              I bought this vehicle so I wouldn't have to hunch over while driving anymore.  I drove a little Honda around for a few years and finally got sick of the lack of space in the car.  The Caprice has an incredible amount of headroom, legroom, shoulder room, etc.  I'm 6'4&quot; and I fit fine and dandy in this vehicle.  My 1992 Caprice drives quiet and smooth, but since it's a very large vehicle the handling isn't as good as a smaller car.  The fuel economy isn't incredible, but it's worth an extra 10 bucks each fill-up for the added comfort and smoothness of the ride.  A friend of mine has a 1986 Chevrolet Caprice with well over 200,000 miles on it, and it's *still* running smooth.  (The car survived my friend's teenage years; that has to say something about the reliability.)  If you're a larger / taller person who would like to drive a big, cozy car then this is the car for you.  <br><br>
