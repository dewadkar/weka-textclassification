            We have owned and enjoyed two Dodge vans.  I just ride in them, so that is where I am coming from, but, both have been economical, sturdy and we have used them to take some wonderful trips.  We have traveled by Dodge van from Maine to New York to Florida - all over Florida and then to the western states.  We have been able to travel on a shoestring and have not been plagued by expensive car repair bills.  Whenever something needed to be replaced or fixed it was a simple, low cost deal that did not interfere with our plans in any way.  They made these things tough in the 1980's.  I am sorry to hear that they have problems in the newer models.  There is nothing like one of these large size vans to use for a trip in my opinion. We have had a V-6 and a V-8, and as I said, I know nothing about them from a mechanics's viewpoint, just from a passenger's.  But I love the older models for their rugged, economical driving for 10 years now!<br><br>
