            Chrysler�s modern performance efforts began in a very unlikely place. The place that I speak of was the post muscle car, front drive K platform era. Today�s performance venue, especially at Dodge is worlds away from the roots of this movement, but it was the crude buzz-bombs of the eighties that got the proverbial foot in the door for cars like the Viper. The development period in question is what some like to call the �Turbo Era� at Chrysler. It ended gracefully before the mid nineties to make room for the new volley of LH based, cab forward designs that ultimately propelled Chrysler back as a builder of near world class cars. But before all of the political correctness, quality engineering, and concept driven designs that we enjoy today, were a rag tag bunch of small, ragged hot-rods, based on work-a-day family cars that had the audacity to stand up to the big guys from America, Asia, and even Europe. The success was not so much in sales, but in image. Several exciting products crept quietly out of stodgy Chrysler in this brief period from about 1984 to 1993, trying to make something of themselves and avoid the hatchet block of Chrysler�s conservative upper management who were, at the time, savoring their mini van efforts. This edgy line of product thinking culminated in 1991 with the introduction of one of the best Chrysler sleepers of all time, the Spirit R/T.

The initial steps were small. In 1978, Dodge released the Omni, hoping to capitalize on some of the success of Volkswagen�s Rabbit. The Omni was not only identical to the four door Rabbit, but was actually powered by modified Rabbit engines, bought from Volkswagen. K-platform engines followed, but nobody raised an eyebrow until 1984. One of the keys to the Rabbit�s success was the image set forth by its sporty GTI variant. Dodge did not have the quality, reliability, structural integrity, or handling of the Rabbit, so they attacked in the only way they knew how, horsepower. A 110 horsepower 2.2 liter, in line four was installed. The suspensions were beefed up, final drive shortened, and better tires thrown on. Exclusive colors were offered with jazzy rims, but overall, the look was subtle. The Omni GLH (Goes Like Hell � I�m not kidding) was a bit scary when pushed to its limitations, but a firm hand could return quite respectable 8.7, 0-60 times. This year also saw the introduction of the Daytona Turbo Z (and Chrysler sister Laser), as well as the new Shelby Charger, which was mechanically similar to the GLH. These two cars were indeed hot, but the GLH�s power to weight ratio made it the most intriguing of the three and symbolized commitment on the part of Dodge to more than just painted on performance. The GLH and Charger received turbo power for 85, now allowing the little Omni to tail a Camaro Z28 through the quarter. 

The rest of the eighties saw a plethora of exciting turbo powered cars from Chrysler. The 2.2 liter Turbo II powered LeBarons, Daytonas, and Shelby Lancers, with sub 8 second, 0-60 runs, proved to be viable low cost alternatives to some rather big names. But the real jaw droppers were yet to come. Consummate performance man, Carroll Shelby, warmed over the Omni GLH to create the GLH-S, and the humdrum Dodge Shadow, to create the Shelby CSX VNT. In addition to VR-15 Goodyear Gatorbacks, and Koni adjustable shocks, was a heavily modified 2.2 liter Turbo II plant producing 175 horsepower and 175 pound feet of torque from 2200-4800 rpms! The little Omni was pulling down 0-60 times in 6.5 seconds! The Shadow CSX was even wilder with variable nozzle turbo power producing 205 pound feet of torque! 0-60 was a touch slower but then again, a lot of the CSX�s juice came though above 60 and on up to more than 130 miles per hour!

These cars were wild rides, but were incredibly crude and difficult to use. A CSX could hold its own with a Mustang GT of the era, but to do this would be quite a workout for even a skilled driver. The engines were simply too much for the early to mid eighties body structures of these cars. About this time, though, Dodge was introducing its new mid sized family sedan, the Spirit. As Chrysler worked to streamline itself, the Omni and Aries were merged to form the Shadow, and ground formerly covered by the 600 and Lancer, now fell to the Spirit.

The Spirit was part of Chrysler�s new A-body, midsized sedan platform that would take them into the 90�s.  Initially, two models were offered, the Spirit, and Plymouth�s Acclaim. For the 1990 model year, the Chrysler Lebaron Sedan (which moved from the Lancer/Lebaron GTS platform) and Saratoga versions were added. Though the cars were all fundamentally the same, the way they were packaged and marketed was rather different, and based on the market goals of each individual division. The Acclaim was the more conservative, economy oriented of the bunch, featuring value option packaging and more reserved looks. The LeBaron was the more traditional, luxury variant, offering buttoned, leather upholstery, wire-type wheels, and padded vinyl tops. The Spirit, being part of the Dodge stable, was the sporty version. A five-speed transmission and turbo power were offered (though they were also available on the Acclaim, Dodge keyed advertising more to the benefits of performance, while Plymouth used the same technology to sell fuel economy). In addition, the Spirit offered a European ES package with sporty seats, fog lamps, and aggressive aluminum rims. The Saratoga was one of Chrysler�s early nineties ventures over seas. Sold only in Europe, the Saratoga offered Spirit engines, and transmissions, with Spirit ES wheels, trim, and interior (though leather lined). It utilized a monochrome version of the LeBaron grill (sans ornamentation), and used Lebaron instrumentation. 

The Acclaim and Spirit used familiar Chrysler plants. The base engine was a 2.5-liter, 100 horsepower 4, followed by a turbo variation yielding 150 horses, and then Chrysler�s 141 horsepower, 3.0 liter V6. The Lebaron used just the base 4 or the 6. The Saratoga used just the turbo 4 or the 6. A five speed manual transmission was standard, and a 3-speed automatic was optional with the four cylinder engines. Step up to the V6 and you were privy to Chrysler�s new 4-speed, overdrive automatic. An independent, strut front suspension and solid beam axle rear was employed that was similar to most Chrysler products at the time.

The net result in the Spirit was positive, yielding first year sales of nearly 70 thousand units (three times the sales of the last year Lancer and 600 combined). The exterior was non-offensive and not very creative, but was clean, simple and modern, especially in the way that the nose and C-pillars were handled. The interior was comfortable and spacious enough, especially in the rear seat, though the dash was painfully angular and looked dated even when it arrived for 89�. The cars were more solid than their predecessors and were very fun to drive. People liked the smooth, Mitsubishi, 3.0-liter V6 and fuel-efficient 4-speed automatic. This was a minivan transaxle and allowed for more than adequate performance in the 3000-pound Spirit body.  

The new Dodge sedan was fulfilling its destiny quite nicely. Sales were acceptable against the all powerful Taurus and Accord, and everyone was happy. Unfortunately, though, all of us that lusted after the pocket rocket Dodges of the eighties, had a new performance king to worship. For 1989, Ford canned their slow selling MT-5 Taurus and replaced it with a performance model that filled its shoes and took it up a notch, the SHO. Ford�s new 220 horsepower, Yamaha powered �Super High Output� sedan was astonishing. It was not quite as quick or as extroverted as some of Chrysler�s small hot rods. However, it was a total performance sedan offering speed as well as handling and refinement in a car that could be driven to work every day.  Maximas were, by now, quite fast and multi cam Lumina�s and Grand Prixs were on the way. Something had to be done.

For the 1991 model year, Dodge revived its R/T (Road/Track) appellation and applied it to the Spirit sedan. The R/T retained the modern, monochrome appearance of the ES model, (the photograph associated with this Epinion is actually that of the R/T) but utilized a new dual overhead cam, turbo charged and intercooled version of Chrysler�s familiar 2.2-liter engine, mated to only a 5-speed, manual transmission. Featuring twin balance shafts, this engine, produced the highest specific horsepower per liter of any Chrysler ever at more than 100 horses per liter. It delivered 224 horsepower at 6000 rpm�s and 217 pound feet of torque at a nice low 2800. Do not laugh, with the right performance parts, Carol Shelby was able to draw 500 horsepower from this very engine in prototype CSX�s.

All front drive Chryslers received front and rear sway bars for 1991, including the Spirit. In addition to this, the R/T received increased spring rates, increased front valving, heavy duty rear shocks, front jounce bumpers for stability, and thicker rear anti roll bars. The R/T also received P205/60HR15 Michelin tires mounted on 15x6 inch wheels. R/T sedans looked very similar to lesser ES models and were initially only offered in Bright White or Indy Red. The white cars featured white Eurocast aluminum wheels (also known as �Snowflake wheels�) from the ES and orangy-red trim stripes. Red Spirits ditched the trim strips but instead had polished aluminum rims (the same wheel) with red accents. The only real indication that this car was something truly special, was the �DOHC INTERCOOLED/MULTI-VALVE� decal, subtly applied to the front doors.

Inside, the R/T featured front buckets with upgraded sports upholstery and improved lateral support. A leather gearshift knob was included too. Medium quartz was the only color offered and cloth upholstery the only fabric available. Racy, red and gray stripes were standard on the seats (though, apparently one R/T was made without them). A tachometer is included, but that was about it. As this was a lightweight, budget rocket at heart, hefty and expensive power functions were mostly all optional.

This brings us to the true heart of the R/T, the orange and black 2.2-liter, Turbo engine. This hot plant began life as Chrysler�s aged 2.2-liter four-banger that had powered millions of Shadows, Aries, and Omni�s over the years. Twin balance shafts were added to quell harshness and vibration. Next was a terrific 16-valve cylinder head mostly developed by Lotus of England (who, by the way, have always been masters at pulling major power from small engines). The head features cross-flow porting and individual intake runners for each cylinder. Shallow pent roof combustion chambers allow room for the four valves (two intake, 1.4 inch, and two exhaust, 1.5 inch), and a central spark plug. In the unfortunate event that the camshaft belt should fail, cutouts in the pistons help prevent damage. Sequential, high flow fuel injectors are computer controlled to allow for precision as well as fuel cutoff capabilities to manage over-rev. Ignition is direct, eliminating the need for a distributor and turbo charging is provided by a Garrett TB03, water intercooled unit.

The on-road results were simply startling. Many journalists have taken a stab at the track with an R/T. The quickest 0-60 time that I found was 5.8 seconds, though this was likely achieved through the uses of clutch-frying tactics. Top speed was 141, though an IROC Daytona with this same engine hit 150, suggesting that the Spirit�s brick-like body may cause some penalty to aerodynamics. The quarter mile was vanquished in a respectable 15.3 seconds at 94.8 miles per hour.  The little R/T sedan also pulled 62.1 miles per hour through the slalom and .81 g�s on the skidpad. Performance such as this rockets the Spirit ahead of such proven competitors as the Saab 9000 Turbo, Mitsubishi Galant VR-4 and Ford�s mighty Taurus SHO. These figures, frighteningly enough, were also quite competitive with such novel acts as the Ford Mustang GT, Chevrolet Camaro Z28, Mitsubishi 3000GT, Toyota Supra Turbo, Nissan 300ZX Turbo, and BMW M3! 

In most cars, a red traffic light is an inconvenience. In the R/T, it is a chance to have some fun. There is not much going on right off of the line. The R/T picks up in a gradual surge starting at about 2200 rpm�s. You can feel a touch of turbo lag but it disappears very quickly. From about 3000 to 6500 rpm�s, the R/T pulls relentlessly and ferociously. The in-line four will seem surprisingly smooth to you, especially if you have experienced the plant in a Shadow or Omni. The feeling is sensational as you are thrown into your seat with neck snapping abandon. In fact, when Motor Trend road tested the Lamborghini Diablo in 1991, then owner Chrysler, provided a couple of R/T's to hall around staff and equipment. Now, the little Dodge was no match for the Diablo, but MT seemed to feel at the time, that a better people/camera hauler for this circumstance, could not be found. They also said that unless the Diablo driver was trying to lose them, the R/T hustled down the road, constantly on the heels of the super Italian. 

Unfortunately, though, the Spirit�s late eighties body is a bit overmatched by this sensational engine. When it comes to performance, the R/T is a more than a willing partner and the intoxicating speed and handling are easy to get to. But practice will be required to prevent tire-waggling torque steer, or just plain liquefying the sticky Michelins from over aggressive launches. The linkage feels a bit like you are rowing around in a bucket of rocks. Shift gates are also a bit too notchy and power shifts can cause an unsettling shockwave of energy to reverberate from your foot, through the tail lamps. The torque steer gremlins are always present too, as you are chirping the tires in the first four gears. The shifter itself is hardly a short-throw affair, and it vibrated like a Cessna hitting an air pocket. This vibration cast off from the car, will become increasingly apparent to nearly all senses. You can feel the harshness in the floor and the shifter. You can hear the turbo whine turn into a coarse boom at the limits. You can see the rear view mirror reverberate, making vision difficult. Frankly, though, who really cares? 

While this entire anti-Lexus attitude is going on, (as the orange, Turbo monster beneath the hood is jerking itself clean out of the body as it screams you to sixty), you are leaving that poor guy in the Subaru SVX to scratch his head while trying to keep your tire smoke out of his face. You will feel like a god. Personally, in a car like this, I like the feel of torque steer because I like the feel of torque. And as long as I can still grab the shifter and cram it into fourth at the redline (around 70, mind you) I am ok with a little visual buzz. The R/T has the exciting, ragged, near product liability feel of a Yenko Nova or Fairlane Thunderbolt. However, the Spirit�s reliable technology, driver side airbag, 19/27-fuel economy, and sub- $20K price tag, make the car seem very unintimidating to have in your driveway. I have seen used, strong running, stock R/T�s with 100k to 180k miles for sale in the $4,000 to $6,000 price range. Mint condition, low mileage examples can even be had for less than $8,000.  

A degree of future collectability is almost assured as there were only 1208, 91� R/T�s built (774 red, 443 white). A third color was added for the second and final year. For 1992, the R/T could also be had in Bright Silver Quartz. This color is the rarest yet. Out of the 191, 1992 R/T�s, only 31 Silver ones were produced. The 92�s also moved a baby step away from the Spirit ES by adopting the new 15� Turbo-Star aluminum wheel from the Daytona and Shadow. The upper and lower grills were now blacked out and wood-look or chromed dash trim was standard. A 150-mph speedometer replaced the old 125-mph unit. The only real performance option was a modified first gear ratio for a quicker take off (but also a lurchier feeling throttle).

Chrysler products of this era (as with many American cars of this era) were prone to paint problems (I have my own theories about this), though the Spirits seem to be more resistant to it than some other Chryslers. In addition, the 4-speed automatic will likely require a rebuild before the 90k mile mark. Other than these two issues, Spirits of any year should prove very reliable. I have seen Spirits with every engine and transmission combination (except for the 4-speed) hit 180k miles with little mechanical trouble. I recommend the entire line of Dodge Spirit with confidence. Base model cars are economical and pleasant to drive. Mid level, V6 editions will prove great family cars, and the Turbo models will give you a truly entertaining ride for very little cash. All Spirits are generally safe, reliable, and because of their simplicity and accessibility of parts, very easy to work on in your own garage. For the 1993 model year, the lineup was simplified and a modified grill and taillights freshened the Spirit until its demise early in 1995.  The only Spirit that really interests me, though, is the 1991 or 1992 R/T.

When I was 18 years old and a complete Mopar gear head, I stopped into a local Chrysler/Plymouth dealership one Thursday afternoon, unexpectedly. Driving past, I saw a shimmery, Indy Red Spirit Sedan parked amongst all of the bla-bla, used New Yorkers and Sundances. As I approached it, I prayed that it would be an R/T, and not just an ES. Indeed it was. 30,000 miles and not a blemish on it. I could not get the keys from the dealer fast enough, and ended up keeping it the whole afternoon. I have driven some rather hot cars in my life, but the Spirit R/T ranks among the very most entertaining to drive. It was simply a blast! My only real complaints are the lack of a turbo boost gauge and availability. This marvelous little engine served out two years in the Spirit R/T (91� and 92�) and then two years in the, also rare, Daytona IROC R/T (92� and 93�), though the Daytona�s even more dated platform allowed it to seem like a less refined performance car. All told, only about 2200 cars were produced with this performance equipment*.

The Spirit R/T is not the fastest or the most attractively styled, or even the most comfortable to drive. The charm of the R/T resides in the in way that all of this hardcore performance is wrapped up in a very unassuming, little car, that foregoes unnecessary luxuries for the sake of simple, unadulterated speed. It takes a special breed of performance enthusiast to truly appreciate this sort of car. The R/T is a bit crude and requires concentration, but the rewards are indeed sweet. I highly recommend the Spirit R/T to anyone who wants an inexpensive and truly thrilling car that will catch all but the sharpest of car guys, completely off guard. If this �sleeper muscle car� feeling of satisfaction is a bit lost on you, I recommend buying a Spirit ES. You will get the same look and will not be disappointed on the road. However, if a monochrome Spirit pulls up beside you at a stoplight, carefully check what is written on the front door first. It may very well be an R/T, and it is about to smoke you and the Mustang GT beside you.  

*For this evaluation, the Chrysler Phantom R/T was not considered because it was never offered for sale outside of Mexico and little information was available to me. The Phantom was a rebadged version of Chrysler's J-body, Lebaron. It was essentially a premium GTC model, (coupe only), which was fortified with the turbo III engine, manual transmission, and other performance upgrades like the Spirit R/T and Daytona IROC. As the Daytona and Lebaron were platform mates, similar performance is to be expected (which would be a slight tick off of the Spirit). The Phantom did differentiate in the sense that it offered a complete range of luxury and convenience options that the other two did not and was arguably the best looking of the three. The Phantom was produced in very small but indeterminate numbers during 1992 and 1993.
