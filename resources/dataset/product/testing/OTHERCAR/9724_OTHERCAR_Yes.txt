            <b>Introduction</b>

While I'm no professional photographer, I would certainly classify myself as an amateur who likes to do things right. The consumer market is flooded with an infinite number of point and shoot cameras, both film and digital, that are fine for John and Jane Doe (or is it DOH!) vacationers who like to have their snapshot taken standing next to Mickey.

If you're one of these, please close your browser now before I offend you some more. The Sony DSC-D770 or similar cameras definitely are <b>not</b> for you, John and Jane.


<b>Howz about some detailz?</b>

The D770 has basically come and gone as a product. It's been discontinued by Sony and you'll really need to dig to even find it on their web site. This is really a <b>good</b> thing, because there are deals to be had out there on the D770. Granted, some stores are still selling them for $750 - $1,000 - a price I would never pay and do not believe the D770 is worth - but if you can find a deal like mine, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it. I bought mine, new in the box from a dealer at a computer show, complete with all accessories, for $500 - <b>including</b> all taxes, etc. It was an "out the door" price. I've also seen them on eBay for similar or better prices.

I'm going to refrain from posting a lot of details about the D770. They've been amply covered by the other reviewers and I'd just be redundant. Suffice it to say that the D770 can be fully automatic, fully manual, including aperture, shutter, ISO, focus, zoom, flash, EV, etc, or anywhere in between. If you're used to a modern SLR, like say a Nikon N90, you'll feel right at home with the D770. Instead I'm going to talk about my experiences with the D770 and some of the problems with the unit.


<b>It's my review, I'll do it the way I want to!</b>

Right off the bat, let me say that I've always been attracted to the D770. At this point in time however, I never would spent the $800 that seems to be the average "new" (it <b>is</b> discontinued) price online. I've been eyeing the new Olympus E-10, which is basically a magnesium-encased, four (4) megapixel version of the D770. Unfortunately, the E10 is $1,500 at your cheaper online stores and $1,800+ at your local Circuit City and Photo Shops. 

The largest perceived drawback of the D770 is its lowly 1.5 megapixel CCD. You can still get a nice 8x10" print from 1.5MP, but any enlargement will give you pixelation, no question about it. For 90% of uses, 1.5MP is more than enough however. It'll fill a screen at resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 with images that a 3.3 megapixel "psuedo-cam" could never duplicate.

The D770 is a fine piece of equipment. It's unquestionably aimed at the avid amateur or "prosumer" of the last two years. If Sony would release a 3+ megapixel version of the D770 today, and price it at $999, I think they'd hit a home run, as long as they fixed the two or three universally recognized "<b>quirks</b>" inherent in seemingly every D770!


<b>Identifying the QUIRKS!</b>

The D770 is a big, heavy digital camera, but it feels oh so nice in your hand. It's a digital camera that <b>everyone</b> looks at when you go to your local tourist attraction, and generates a lot of questions from guys sporting popular point and click digicams dangling around their necks. It's obviously from a feeling of inadequacy and camera envy ;-)

OK, so it's size and coolness aren't a quirk, but it's damn cool nonetheless.

The real quirks have more to do with focusing and becoming "one" with your tempermental D770 to get consistently good shots (sounds like a review of my espresso machine ;-). The D770 focusing problems are well known and documented on the web. If you're adventurous, there is also an operation that, once performed, will catapult you into digital picture nirvana. Unfortunately, I'm not going to detail that cure here, but do a Google search for "D770 Focus" and it'll be on the first page. If you have butter fingers (and I don't mean the candy bar), don't even bother doing it yourself. Take it to a local camera shop with a printout of the instructions and pay them $100 - it'll be the best $100 you ever spent. Your D770 will take pictures that you never thought possible.

A few lucky souls got units that were perfectly calibrated from the factory. To those of you who did, or think you did, you are either blind, in which case it doesn't matter, or you deserve my congratulations, because it's apparently a very small percentage.

Another problem, which is nothing new, is the built-in flash. In a word, it <b>sucks</b>! It's plainly the worst flash anyone has ever built into a camera of this caliber. Do yourself a humongous favor and spend $40 on a hotshoe flash made for digital cameras. Using a heavier duty flash from your SLR film camera will purportedly fry your D770, so you may not want to go that route. Sony's model H1000 works like a charm and costs about $80 online.

Once you fix the focus, or "learn" your way around it, get a new, matching flash, and succor your tempermental new sweetheart into yielding her best each time you fire the "shutter" you'll be ready for the big leagues. Then all you'll need to do is find subjects worthy of unleashing your photographic talents onto.


<b>In a nutshell</b>

The D770 is a great little "SLR" style digicam, once you and she get to know eachother (She's definitely female. She'll do one thing today and act totally different tomorrow). As you get to know the very subtle nuances of the D770, you will steadily and (hopefully) rapidly see a corresponding increase in your picture quality until you're generally happy with your consistency of picture taking with "her." 

The D770 is <b>unquestionably</b> the ideal starter digicam for those wanting to break into the more serious side of digital photography. If you can find one for $600 or less, by all means jump on it. Use it for 6-12 months, because if you can master the D770, you will surely be able to handle the next step up to, say, an Olympus E10, Minolta Dimage D7, or even a Canon D30 or Nikon D1 (if you're rich or very serious).

If your experience with Miss 770 turns out to be a disaster, at least you'll have looked cool in failing miserably. 

There's something to be said for that.
