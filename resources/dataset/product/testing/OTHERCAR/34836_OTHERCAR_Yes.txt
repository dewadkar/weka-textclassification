            Honda Odyssey.  Great redesign.  I like it.  I drive a 2000 Integra Type R, and my dad bought this car.  He wanted a bigger car, didn't like the SUV's, so he bought an Odyssey.  And it's a great car.  Or van, should I say?  

Smooth...  Thats what I have to say about the ride.  It's smoother than my mom's Civic EX, and has more pickup.  The turning radius is amazing, really short.  Even without premium, it gets 205 hp.  Not bad.....  V6 VTEC is nice, having some horse power in the top end with some passing power.  Wow, it drives like an Accord or Camry.

Sliding doors..  Coolest thing I've ever seen.  Chevy may have already come out with this, but hey, I just like the Honda. -=).  The 1999's may have had problems, but hey, its a first year car and all first year cars have teething problems.  The doors on the EX are power, pull a handle and they open, or push the button on the remote and they open.  (and close).  
3rd row.  Nice.  The bench folds away in 6 seconds.  (Motor Trend did a comparo of minivans, Odyssey first with 6 seconds, Chevy Venture had 26 sec.  Caravan and Sienna in the middle.)  Its easy to fold too.  

The interior has air vent controls on the top for the passengers, and you can easily turn on or off all the lights.  The Ex has climate control, which is nice; pick a temperature, and leave it.  The steering wheel has stereo controls, which is nice because I haven't seen that in any car in awhile.  It also has cruse, which my integra doesn't have (Acura thinks cruse weighs too much).  Another nice feature is the headlights go off automaticly after 15 sec you close the driver door.  The van can take corners impressively, and it is nice and easy to drive.  It also have big ground clearance (in that Motor Trend comparo,it had the most), which means you keep the front lip off the curbs at McDonalds.  The 2nd row is adjustable, and can be removed, which is very nice.  

There's also Traction Control, to save your butt in a bad situation.
There are almost no options from the facotry on the ex, except for navigation system.  This is a good system, I've heard, but we didn't get it.  

What do I hate?  Well, first the wait is 2 months.  Long time, but worth it.  The price is also non negociable, and sometimes inflated.  White gets dirty eaisly.  Its hard to clean.  The alloy 16 inch rims get dirty quick.  I'm also concerned how these doors are going to work in the cold winter.  The spare is somewhat complicated to get to also.  It's in the middle, and you have to lift up all sorts of things to get to it.  And the gas mielage.  18 city 25 highway?  A Camaro Z28 SS (V8, 320 hp) gets 17 city and 28 highway.  It could be that I just get 25 mpg in my Integra, and I'm not used to this low gas mielage.  

How's the drive?  Wow, like a car.  It's smoother than my Civic, handles good, and its easy to drive because you sit higher.  It's got good pickup, and has nice passing power on the highway.  It's fun to drive, and I'm wanting to take it racing to see how it would do......

If you're in the market for a minivan, the Odyssey is probably definently 1 option to look at, a must look.  Test drive it too.  I like it, and I drive a sports coupe.  My dad likes it, and hes just an average guy.  Unless you got under 3 or over 7 people in your family, its the perfect car.  Or Minivan...<br><br>
