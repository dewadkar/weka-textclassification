            After a great experience with a 1995 XJR, we replaced it with a 2000 model.

The current Jaguar Saloon models are the most elegant looking cars on the road today. The XJR takes the basic form and adds some slight styling cues that give the form a more aggressive look. This is accomplished by a slight lowering of the car, body color trim (instead of chrome), and a wire mesh grill. The larger tires also add a lot to the visual effect.

Inside, the car is well appointed. For both good and bad, the Ford influence is starting to make itself felt. For the good, the ergonomics in the car have improved. Controls are easier to see and access. Leg room and seat comfort have improved slightly. For the bad, the wood work, though outstanding, seems a little less refined than the older XJR. This makes itself quite apparent on the center console ashtray, which is now leather covered instead of wood veneered. The leather also seems slightly more coarse. For what it is worth, this are minor nits to pick, as the interior is still excellent -- warmer, more inviting, and prettier than other luxury cars in its class.

The sounds system is great. The GPS sucks. Jaguar screwed this up in the 2000 XJ series. The screen is a small black and white lcd display which does double duty as the radio display. Because of the limited display, the input controls are difficult. Jaguar would have been better served by not offering this option.

The phone also sucks. Although the voice control interface is convenient and works well, the phone itself is analog. This means poor quality reception and limited rate plans. Repeated queries to Jaguar have yielded promises of a digital phone in the future... but none has arrived yet.

The power train in this car is awesome. The 1995 XJR was a 322 hp supercharged straight six. The 2000 model uses a 370 hp supercharged V8. The transmission has also changed, the new car sporting a 5-speed automatic unit sourced from Mercedes Benz. The combination of the engine and silky transmissions provides a strong, smooth, quick accelleration. The power in this car is addictive.

We've had the car almost a year now. We've only had one small electrical problem with it. This could have been cleared up immediately, except it was hard for the dealer to isolate. It took three trips back to the dealer. Of course, the repairs were covered under warranty, our dealer provided a free loaner, and the dealer couldn't have been more cooperative.
