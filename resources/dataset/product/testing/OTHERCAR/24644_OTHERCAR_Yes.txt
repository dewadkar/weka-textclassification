            I stated in my previous post that I went shopping for a new car this weekend to replace my trusty but aging 1994 Cadillac DeVille. I'm happy with my DeVille, but at the point where I can trade and (hopefully) get something for it or keep it and run it into the ground. I was also motivated by many automakers offering 0.0% financing. Unfortunately, Cadillac has dropped the 0.0% offer and gone back to standard financing as of November 18th and, despite my current car's fantastic condition, the dismal offers for my trade are kind of forcing me to look at used vehicles. Well, GM still is offering its fantastic offer on the remainder of its line-up. Believing I still had a shot at an upscale new car, I went one down from Cadillac and checked out a new Buick Park Avenue.

The Park Avenue I looked at is finished in Bronzemist with a medium gray interior. It is shod with 225/60R16 blackwall tires on beautiful chromed rims as part of the available "Prestige Package." It is powered by a SEFI 3.8 litre V-6 giving 205 hp @ 5200 RPM and 230 ft./lbs. torque @ 4000 RPMs. The engine is mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. The Park Avenue's reported fuel economy is 20 MPG city / 29 MPG highway. Not bad for a domestic full-size car. An optional supercharged 3.8 V-6 provides 240 hp versus the standard 205 hp for more get-up and go. The supercharged V-6 is standard in the upscale Park Avenue Ultra.

The exterior of the Buick Park Avenue can be described as very attractive and Jaguar-esque. The front end features a traditional toothy Buick grille and a prominent stand-up hood ornament with the tri-shield logo. Out back are wall-to-wall tail lamps with a clear Lexan cover. 

The seats of the Park Avenue are comfortable and supportive. Six-way power seats with 2-position memory and recline are standard. Heated seats are available. The driver faces an array of analog and digital instruments along with a plethora of idiot lights. An information center below the gauges gives useful data on fuel economy, tire pressure and fluid life by selecting one of several buttons vertically aligned to the left of the gauges.  There is a little cove below the radio which is handy for holding change, etc.  The Park Avenue comes with standard driver, passenger and side airbags. The windshield-mounted rearview mirror automatically adjusts for day/night driving and features a novel compass display.  The On-Star satellite tracking/GPS system is also standard and is accessed by a tiny button on the mirror.

Driving the Park Avenue was a pleasant experience. Visibility is excellent as one looks through that panoramic windshield using the tri-shield ornament to "aim" the car. The ride was silky smooth like my Cadillac DeVille. Bumps potholes, expansion joints, etc. were barely noticeable. The car accelerated quickly and smoothly with power at the tip of your toe. I felt as if I were driving my 4.9 litre V-8 powered Cadillac DeVille despite the fact that the Park Avenue has a significantly small six-cylinder plant. The ride was quiet with no squeaks, rattles or buzzes. The engine did not protest when I mashed the accelerator to the floor. The transmission shifted seamlessly. Braking was effortless and smooth. Stopping distances were relatively short and there was little evidence of brake fade.The ABS prevented the Park Avenue from losing control in panic stops. The car handled well on sharp curves exhibiting but little of the understeer typical of a big Detroiter. Despite its FWD configuration, there was no noticeable 'torque-steer' effect. 

The Delco-Bose AM/FM/Cassette/CD stereo gave clear and crisp sound as do almost all modern automotive systems. Redundant controls for volume and tuning are located on the steering wheel spokes. The HVAC system was effective and efficient, also with redundant controls on the wheel. Unfortunately, the tilt wheel uses a cheap-feeling and clunky manual lever. I believe an upscale car like the Park Avenue should have a standard electrically controlled tilt & telescope function.

The trunk is positively cavernous with a low-liftover decklid and a handy cargo net to capture loose items. Unfortunately there is a stupid "donut tire" for a spare! Get real, guys! This is the 21st Century and donut tires should've been left back in the day of polyester leisure suits!

The standard powertrain warranty is 36 months/36,000 miles, but the salesman offered a free 5 year/60,000 mile warranty if I considered the car I just test drove. The body is warranted against rust for 6 years or 100,000 miles.

If  GM could only get their interiors right.  I believe that GM is squeezing suppliers for the lowest possible cost for its interior components and switchgear and it is showing. I have noticed a marked difference between the interior of a Cadillac DeVille,  Lexus LS400 and a Buick Park Avenue. The Cadillac's interior is almost as nice as that of the Lexus but I noticed some very disturbing things about the Buick. 

The instrument panel for one seems to be of a pretty archaic design. C'mon, I know Buicks have an older clientele, but I don't want to feel as if I've gone through Mr. Peabody's WABAC machine when I look at my Park Ave's instrument panel. The column mounted shift lever, (no gripe - I like column-mounted shifters) has a button on top for Stabilitrac. The problem is, around the opening for the button was a significant amount of "flash" or untrimmed plastic excess. The false wood at the bottom of the instrument panel really looked false. Its matte finish doesn't impart an upscale look to me. The ashtray was flimsy and got stuck when I tried it, much to the embarassment of the salesman. 

The Park Avenue had a lot of really nice features. It had just about everything the 1998 Lexus LS400 I looked at later in the day but you can tell there was a vast gulf between the quality of the interior of the Park Ave. and the Lex. GM definitely has their drivetrains down pat and offers some of the most beautiful and distinctive styling offered by any manufacturer. They just really have to knuckle under and get their interiors up to par. I know they can do it. I have no complaints about my two current Cadillacs. If the Park Avenue's interior can turn off a lifetime GM fan like myself, how can they sell to a critical younger buyer who favors imports?
