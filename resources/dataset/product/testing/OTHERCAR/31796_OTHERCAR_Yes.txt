              2000 HONDA CIVIC
  1.6 liter 4-cyl engine
  4-spd automatic transmission
  multiport fuel injection
  feedback fuel system


One of the main reasons I bought this car is because I wanted a car that would last a long time. Ever notice all of the old Honda Civics and Accords that are still out on the roads? They may not look so great,but they're still truckin' along. I also wanted something inexpensive but was tired(still am,actually)of seeing Chevrolet Cavaliers and there was no way I was gonna get a Ford. I'll start with all the features on the Honda Civic:

  The gas mileage I get with my Civic is awesome-28 city miles per gallon and 35 highway miles per gallon. Actually this was another factor in determining what kind of car I chose. When I bought it gas prices had skyrocketed and I had previously been driving a gas-guzzler(Chevy Blazer). 
  
  I own a cleaning business and I have a 4-year old son,so my arms are always full. Whether it's toys,cleaning stuff, or kid,I always have my arms full of something so keyless entry is really convenient.

  Of course I love having a CD player,too-now the speakers aren't anything that will win a prize for loudest and bumpin'est-but they're still loud enough without sounding like crap.

  The rear-child locks are wonderful. No longer do you need to worry about your child jumping out of the car when it stops. For people without kids you can just flip a little switch and de-activate it. However,it is kinda funny to have a friend sit in the back and lock them in.

  When I got my Civic about a year ago,I was impressed by what a smooth ride it has. The maintenance-reminder is nice,too-when it's time for an oil-change,a little square in the dash changes from yellow to red. The Civic only requires an oil change every 7500 miles!

  All 2000 Hondas come with a 36,000 mile/3 year warranty and a 12,000 mile/1 year replacement parts warranty. Now I'm sure that your Honda dealer will be happy to sell you an extended warranty for a mere $1200 like mine did. This will cover your car up to 100,000 miles.

  The 2000 Honda Civic is roomier than you might think. I'm 5'6",130 lbs. and there's plenty of room for me. My husband is 6'1",200 lbs. and fits just fine with the seat all the way back. He does,however,complain about long trips in it so we try to fly for those if possible.

  I am very happy with my Civic. I recommend it to anyone that wants good gas mileage,cool features,or anyone that's sick of Cavaliers!! I wouldn't recommend it to someone that's really big or has to drive long distances a lot. So anyway,thanks for reading my review. I will update this if I have any problems with it-right now mine only has 16,000 miles on it so I guess that's a possibility(knock on wood). Don't forget to rate my review-I'd appreciate it!
