            When my daughter turned 16 she got her license, and her first job. It was becoming more and more difficult to take her to and from work, so we decided it was time for us to start looking at used cars for her.  She had the money in the bank to pay for one, but I was <i>very</i> fussy when it came to choosing one for her.  By the way, this was a surprise - she knew nothing about it!

<b>Used Car Lots</b>
We started looking for cars in the used car lots.  I had my mind set on a Subaru, Honda or Toyota.  We've had Subaru's and Honda's in the past and they were VERY reliable cars.  Trouble was, there were very few cars like these on any of the lots.  They were all American made cars, and were way over priced.  When we did find a Subaru it had too many miles on it and was again, over priced.  Now our choice was to buy straight from an individual who was trying to sell their car, but how do you know who you can trust and if the car is reliable or a lemon?

<b>Consumer Reports</b>
I decided to check out Consumer Reports before I made my selection - I knew from the past that they have a "reliable used car" list in their magazine.  But we didn't have time to subscribe and get the magazines - we wanted to buy a car within two weeks time.  I was so pleased when I found Consumer Reports Online!  You can join for a year or for a small fee you can join for just one month.  I joined Consumer Reports for one month, put it on my credit card, and immediately started searching for the perfect, reliable used car.

The 1995 Toyota Tercel was listed in their reliable used car section, and according to their price guide, it was within our price range.

<b>Checking The Local Papers</b>
I started checking the local paper every day looking for this car.  It took some persistence and effort, but I finally found one!  My husband had told me there would probably be a lot of used cars in the paper because of the huge layoffs from the oil companies here in Alaska.  That's exactly what we found.  A British Petroleum worker was moving back to UK, and he needed to get rid of his Tercel and quite quickly.  We dickered some on the price and ended up getting it for $6500.  It came with 4 new winter tires on rims and 4 new summer tires.  This price was cheaper than we were expecting to pay.

<b>Squeaky Brakes</b>
The next summer the brakes started to make a grinding and squeaking noise, and we had to pay $120 to have brake pads put on them.  That seemed to fix the problem and they are working fine now.

<b>How the Car Handles</b>
This car is a four door, and it's quite small.  It is an automatic with front wheel drive, and handles really well.  My daughter did lose control coming down a curving icy hill soon after she bought the car, but she was inexperienced and didn't handle the car properly.  She ran into a hard, icy snowbank with her right bumper, and it cracked the front fender and actually broke the windshield washer bottle.  She was fine and that was all the damage that was done to the car.  After we replaced the washer bottle, the damage was purely cosmetic.  It has always been a little sluggish going up big hills, but otherwise has a lot of pep and handles corners great.  If we take it out of the overdrive while climbing hills is has much more pep.

<b>No Bells and Whistles</b>
This is your basic car.  Manual windows, manual locks, and radio...the basics.  She does have air conditioning, but living here in Alaska it doesn't get used very much.  The gear shifter is between the front bucket seats, and it has an overdrive button.  This over drive is nice for highway driving, it helps get better gas mileage (which is between 30-35 on the highway).

<b>Seating</b>
The front seats are quite comfortable, but the back seating is a bit cramped for three people, or for anyone with long legs.  The material is a naugehide and very easy to keep clean and maintain.

<b>Safety Features</b>
This model has dual air bags and power brakes.  The air bags have never been deployed, thank the Lord!

<b>Our Teenager Loves This Car</b>
It has been two years now since our daughter bought her car.  She came home from a winter teen retreat, and her car was sitting in the driveway, cherry red.  She was estatic!  She absolutely loves her car.  There are only 60,000 miles on it, so it should last her a long long time!
