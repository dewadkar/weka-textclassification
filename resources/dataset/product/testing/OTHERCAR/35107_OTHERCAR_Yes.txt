            After extensive comparison shopping for a business vehicle, I purchased a new Buick LeSabre Custom.  This auto is extremely well built, has excellent power for a fuel efficient V-6 and handles better than any mid-size car I tested from other U.S. car makers.  Paying only $21,000 with a 5 year old, high mileage trade in - the LeSabre has become my favorite vehicle in many years.  Only dislike - with front wheel drive, it's hard to find a utility to hold large cups (unless purchased as a built in feature) because the mid- front floorboard shape is awkward -- even though attractive.  Driving and commuting long distances in Southern California (freeway and mountain driving) is a pleasure.  Quiet as a Mercedes, responsive.  The LeSabre is ideal for professional sales and other jobs where excellent visibility, handling and parking ease are important.  The looks are also a definite plus.  
The Custom is the less 'plush' version of LeSabre - no leather interior - which is better in very hot climates.  Someone wanting the maximum add on's and more luxury should opt for the higher end version.  The Custom is aimed at people who use cars rather than buy cars for show.<br><br>
