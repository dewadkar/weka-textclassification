            I'll start the review by saying that I don't own a truck, but I rent them quite often to do chores now that I've replaced my Jeep Grand Cherokee with an Acura TL Type S.

The first truck I rented this year was brand new Ford F-150 with a lot of luxury options.  I picked it up from the rental place with a whole 17 miles on it (I know the guys who run the rental shop, they always take good care of me.)

I was terribly disappointed by this truck.  It looked great, but the ride was simply AWFUL.  You could feel every bump on the road, no matter how small, the seats had leather but were dang uncomfortable and bounced me around like a toy, it was loud, noisy, and jumped all over the road.  I was exhausted after driving it for two hours and couldn't wait to get my feet back on the ground.

Last week I needed a truck again, but this I got a Dodge Ram with 13,000 miles on it.  What a difference!  This truck was a lot more solid and felt planted to the road.  

The ride was incredibly smooth and whisper quiet, and it laughed at potholes and other road imperfections.  The cab had a ton of room and all of the controls were well placed - although I would have liked radio controls on the steering wheel.  I actually felt relaxed after driving 100+ miles in this truck.  I also loved the tall ride height and visibility, in the Ford, you feel as if the truck sticks out 10 feet in front of you.

On the downside, the interior felt a bit cheap, and I noticed some problems.  The center armrest was loose and one of the storage compartments also had a loose door.  I know rental cars and trucks more abuse than normal, but I expected a better fit and finish after only 13,000 miles.

If I were to consider buying one of these, the Dodge would win hands down - its no contest.
