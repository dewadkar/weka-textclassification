            We bought the 2000 Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Edition after the birth of our second child. Although we loved our sports sedan and still don't  consider ourselves  mini van people, we needed more room.

Our van is loaded with everything you can get, CD, 2 sliding doors (1 of which is automatic, great with 2 kids, but makes me a little nervous!), leather interior, flip and fold seats, TV/VCR, rear heat and air, integrated booster seats, you name it, we got it! We figured if we were getting a mini van, might as well go all out!

First the pros:

Love,love,love the room! We have hauled a treadmill, outdoor children's playhouse, twin doll house bed (okay, our kids are spoiled!!)and every baby accessory you could imagine, playpen, swing, double stroller, travel crib! We didn't have to leave anything home!

The flip and fold seats are wonderful! I can get them out by myself, which is a big plus! Don't have to wait for the hubby to do it for me!
I can also crawl from the passenger seat to the back if one of the kids is having a &quot;break-down&quot;!

The TV/VCR is wonderful! Traveling to my parents house is so peaceful and quite now. They can watch their movie in the back with headphones and we can listen to the radio or CD in the front. Everyone is happy! No more &quot;It's my turn to listen to Raffi!&quot;

Now the cons:

We have had tons of trouble with some of the extras on the van.

We didn't get our headphones until 8 months AFTER we had bought the van. They were supposed to arrive within 4 weeks after purchase. No one had an answer, not our dealer or Chevrolet. Big Hassle! We got really tired of listening to the Little Mermaid!!

From day one our cruise control &quot;surges&quot; when it is on. Sometimes it shuts off, sometimes the car decelerates and you have to pull over. We have had it in 3 times for this problem and they still haven't fixed it.

The over head compass/fuel gauge flashes on and off. No big deal, I know, but when you pay that much for a vehicle, you expect things to work. They have ordered the wrong part 2 times and we are still waiting for this to get fixed. It has been broken along with everything else since day 1. They dealer doesn't seem to worried about it, and neither does Chevrolet.

The overhead console in the back, which holds the air controls and volume controls comes out of the ceiling. This is also being &quot;worked on&quot;.

Hopefully this is just a rare case of a bad &quot;apple&quot;. But the Chevy Venture has left a bad taste in our mouth.  I know these aren't big major problems, but it has been a complete hassle. When I buy a new car, I don't feel like it should be in the shop every couple of weeks! I have called our dealer several times and Chevrolet themselves. Neither of them have tried to resolve the problem.  With all of these problems, I don't think I could recommend this van to any of my friends, just in case!<br><br>
