            The Chevrolet Suburban,  an awesome vehicle.  Big roomy,  powerful, and good looking also.  A long time competitor for the most popular vehicle.  The suburban is easy to get up to speed with the powerful engine that it has, and with that powerful engine you can tow anything whether it be a friend out of the mud, or towing the family boat down to the lake.
   While I only test drove it, I can tell you that it is well worth the time it takes to test drive it.  Especially if you have an awesome car salesman that will let you really drive it to test the handling/ acceleration..  The thing is strong enough to pull up to highway speeds in a matter of seconds..  
   The comfort level in the suburban is awesome.  The plush leather seats just seems to hold you in place, and the back seats are even more roomy.  With enough room that you could lay down the seats and load a 'fridge with out a problem.  Or anything else you might want to do, I don't believe that there are many limitations here..<br><br>
