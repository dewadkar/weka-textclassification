            The redesigned 1999 Grand Cherokee is a beauty.  Inside and outside.  It looks good in your driveway, good from behind the steering wheel, and even more importantly, it drives as well as it looks!  This is an all-around fantastic SUV.

I decided last year to get a new SUV.  I wanted an Explorer.  Everyone has Explorers and they are great.  So I went ahead and did a little research, and much to my surprise, the Jeep Grand Cherokee came back time and again as the leader of the pack in 1999,  The Grand Cherokee?!?  I didn�t know anyone with one of those.  But it sure was pretty after its overhaul, so I decided I should at least look at it.

I went down to the local car-selling strip and the first one I reached was the Jeep place.  Whew, what a relief.  I can look at it and get it out of the way I thought.  So I did.  Only once I looked, I loved.  The car was phenomenal.  It drove like a champ too.

The outside was obvious.  We can all see right away what a good job the engineers did (Keep it up guys!), but inside is even more amazing!  Never had I been inside an SUV and felt like I was sitting in a luxury car (OK, I lead a sheltered life).  And wait a second, this is an AMERICAN car?!?  No way!  There is nothing American about it in appearance and feel.  It feels like a high-quality, well-designed luxury import.

So I finally pulled myself away from the Jeep and reluctantly left to go to the next stop.  It was the Toyota dealer.   Here I looked at the 4-Runner.  No comparison, especially when you look at the sticker price � ouch!  The 4-Runner drove nearly as well as the Grand Cherokee, but the inside was disappointing.  It didn�t feel luxurious and if I was going to spend over $32.000 on any car or SUV, I wanted a little luxury!

The final stop that day was the Ford dealer.  I got out, looked at and drove the Explorer and couldn�t leave quickly enough.  What a disappointment after what I had seen.  This is absolutely an American car.  It drives like a truck, there is no illusion of quality inside, and there is certainly no reason to buy the Explorer over the Grand Cherokee.

I have had the Grand Cherokee for over a year now, and I still love it.  It has been problem free and a joy to drive.  I feel safe, yet I can still have fun and the car never skips a beat at high speeds.  If a midsize SUV is what you want, you needn�t look any farther.  This car is worth every penny!
