            I BOUGHT MY 2000 MPV ES TO REPLACE MY FORD TAURUS WAGON WHICH SERVED ME WELL FOR 11 YEARS. RECOMMENDED BY CONSUMER DIGEST AS A "BEST BUY", I PURCHASED THE VAN FOR THIS REASON. I CHOSE THE TOP OF THE LINE ES MPV, WHICH CAME WITH LOTS OF GREAT EXTRAS FOR LESS THAN A BASIC TOYOTA OR HONDA. LEATHER, SUN ROOF, 6 DISC CD CHANGER ETC., ALL FOR A GREAT PRICE. THE SIZE OF THE VAN IS PERFECT: SHORTER THAN OTHER VANS, IT'S ROOMY INSIDE, YET EASY TO PARK. THE MAZDA NAME HAS ALWAYS GONE HAND IN HAND WITH RELIABILITY. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO TAKE MY VAN IN FOR SEVERAL RECALLS, INCLUDING A WRONGLY DOCUMENTED TIRE PRESSURE LISTING. I HAD KEPT MY TIRES AT THE RECOMMENDED PSI, AND I KEPT PICKING UP NAILS AND GETTING FLAT TIRES. ONCE I RECEIVED THE CORRECT PSI IN THE FORM OF A RECALL, MY TIRES WERE INFLATED PROPERLY AND I NEVER PICKED UP ANOTHER NAIL. WORSE, HOWEVER, WAS THAT AFTER OWNING THE CAR FOR LESS THAN 2 YEARS (PURCHASED IN OCT. '99)AND WITH JUST OVER 18,000 MILES, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. OF COURSE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THIS HAS MADE ME LOOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF MY CAR. I PLAN TO KEEP THIS CAR FOR AT LEAST 8 MORE YEARS AND I AM NOW WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MAJOR REPAIR WILL BE NEEDED NEXT. THOUGH I LOVE MY MPV, I COULD NOT RECOMMEND IT NOW BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR REPAIR AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS CAR JUST DRIVES AROUND TOWN TAKING KIDS TO SCHOOL. IT'S NEVER BEEN PUT UNDER ANY PARTICULAR STRAIN THAT WOULD CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION TO BE OVERWORKED.
