            I'm just a guy who loves to take photos of everything and everyone in all kinds of lighting conditions and situations. The G3 allows me to do just that! This camera is perfect for the novice like me but still sophisticated and feature rich enough for the professional photographer. Some people who have seen some of the photos taken with my G3 often wonder if they were professionally shot. The G3 is capable of taking elegant looking B&W shots as well as sepia photos and time lapsed photos. Since I currently live in Hawaii, I really appreciate the panoramic/photo stitch mode. It also has a movie mode that will take little 3 minute movies! The colors come out rich, true and vibrant. Although there are many modes to shoot in that will produce varying results, the auto focus mode practically takes the shot for you with crystal clear details. 

Connecting the G3 to my Powerbook has never been simpler and the download speed from camera to computer is the fastest I've ever seen! Even though I use Photoshop to edit some of my  G3 photos, the included software makes image editing childs play.

My ONLY complaint about this camera is a minimal one. Upon looking through the optical viewfinder you will immediately notice that the lens barrel is visible. I barely use the viewfinder, preferring to use the LCD monitor to frame images instead, but in the rare instances that I do use the viewfinder, I find this construction flaw somewhat distracting. 

The macro mode combined with an additional macro lens (not included) will produce some dramatic close ups that are so CLEAR you'll practically be able to touch or smell them.

Your photos will just keep on improving the more you shoot with the G3. In the year 2010 this will STILL be a great camera and a wise investment!
