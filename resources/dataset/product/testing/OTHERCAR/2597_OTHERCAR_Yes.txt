            The Nissan Maxima represents the most balanced combination of comfort, performance, styling, and reliability I have ever encountered in an automobile under $20,000. It's as simple as that. 

<b>Accord, Camry? Step Aside.</b>

Why is the Maxima even in the same category as these other Japanese sedans? Don't get me wrong, they're fine cars. But they don't have near the amount of horsepower or handling of a Maxima (SE). The bottom line here is that the other full-size Japanese sedans don't hold a candle to the Maxima and the proof is in the pudding. Drive them and you'll see. 

The only car that can probably compete with this amazing V6 the Maxima has for under 25k may be one of a BMW 3-series. The Maxima has more room though and the rest of the feature comparisons depends heavily on driving preferences but both options are excellent deals for the money. 

<b>Engine and Ride</b>

This thing is <b>SILKY SMOOTH</b>. It's as if the car is gliding over the road with minimal effort. It's Lexus-like baby. It packs in 200 horses (222 for the 2001 model) and can handle a lot more if you're willing to pony up some dough for a few mods. 

If you're looking for pure performance, the Nissan Maxima is the only full-size sedan in it's class that comes in a  5-speed model (SE) with a stiffer sportier suspension and more horses -- ideal for sheer driving fun. Believe me, it is fun.

Be careful though, it's easy to drive this thing 90 mph on the highway without realizing it. The ride is so solid, it's hard to tell that you're in line for a speeding ticket. 

<b>Reliable? You bet!</b>

Go check out the classifieds -- most of the Maximas have extremely high mileage. I read about a guy who took his Maxima over 600k miles! Maximas serve their owners well. Just be sure to change the oil every 5000 miles (yes 5000, this is a Maxima, not a Pontiac Grand Am) and perform all the regularly scheduled maintenance.

<b>Fast? Hell yeah!</b>

Most people don't realize that a standard 99 Maxima SE goes from 0-60 in 6.7 seconds. For a car that size for that price, that's incredible. The downside is that it inspires me to drive the life out of the car -- which, although fun, is undoubtedly taxing in the long run.

<b>Styling and Amenities</b>

The interior is so practical and well-designed. Roomy, leather-wrapped steering wheel, bucket seats, 6-speaker BOSE audio, and many more appealing goodies gives this car an aspect of luxury (especially the GLE model) that can't be found in it's competition. The dash is so easy to read and everything is spread out and easily accessible.

The exterior is modest yet aggressive. What did i just say? I don't know, but you can take a look at the pic yourself. I needn't say a thing.

<b>Keep in Mind</b>

My opinion on this car is entirely relative to the full-size sedan market in the same price range as the '99 Maxima. If you have 30 or 40 grand to play with, by all means explore Acura, Lexus, BMW and Infiniti (side note: The Infiniti I30 is basically a souped up version of the Maxima.. *drool*). 

The 2001 model can get to be a bit pricey topping off at around 30k-- I still would not have any regrets putting forth the money for a loaded 2001 Maxima SE. In any case, I encourage you to consider the Maxima. I find it hard to criticize this car-- and i'm always criticizing everything.
