            I purchased a 1998 Hummer in Feb. of 2001. I found a white
4DR Hardtop in Little Rock, Ark. that was advertised on the internet. I was curious about how the Hummer handled on the 
highway, and suggested to my 'other' half that we go to Little Rock, and just 'look', at some of the Hummers. These 
Hummers are the most incredible vehicles I have ever seen.
 The Hummer has 17" of ground clearance, each wheel has a final drive gear reduction. All of the driveline is located inside of the frame so that none of the components are exposed to damage. Inside is comfortable and VERY wide. Mine has a monsoon stereo system,with 16 speakers. The handling of the Hummer is excellent. The width and low center of gravity make it extremely stable in hard corners,and hardly any side-to-side sway can be felt. At about 68mph on the highway you can actually get 17mpg.
After Test driving this Hummer, I told my other, "Well, I guess I'm going to have to take this one home". I was afraid that I was going to have to sleep with it, (which was really my idea), but my wife made me stay in the house.
If you ever get the chance to own one, Don't Pass It Up!
