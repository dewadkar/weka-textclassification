            My <b>Pontiac Sunbird</b> has got lots of spunk, but it also provides a smooth ride. It is a small car, with 4 cylinders, and gets great gas mileage. It gets around 30 miles per gallon which I realize isn't as good as many cars, but it's a big improvement from the 17 mpg I've gotten from my Chevy Celebrity (see review for more information on this car).

The <b>Pontiac Sunbird</b> was purchased with over 100,000 miles on it, and was still running well. The only problems I've seen is with the cooling system. It has overheated several times, and my mechanic told me that based on some things he found under the hood, that the previous owner had also had problems with this.

They had apparently replaced the thermostat, some hoses and a couple of seals. He also pointed out where there were white traces on the motor where there had previously been a coolant leak.

Aside from that, the car runs great. I don't expect to get a lot of driving out of this one before I need more repairs though based on the evidence shown to me by my mechanic.

I don't know if the coolant problems are common in the <b>Pontiac Sunbird</b> or if I just happened to get one with these troubles. I have driven this one for a bit over a month, and have had no other problems with it though.

I like this smaller car because it is so much easier to find a parking place. The steering is also much easier than my other car, and the ride is very smooth and comfortable.

The rear seating in this car is limited, though I can transport 5 people in relative comfort as long as the back seat passengers are kids. There is ample trunk space for the necessities I need to carry around.

My <b>Pontiac Sunbird</b> is a four door, with an automatic transmission. I think that even with the cooling system problems I've had that this car was still worth the money I paid for it, and even though I am looking at getting more repairs done in the near future, I am still happy with my purchase. I feel that I got a good deal simply because I got the car very cheap and am willing to invest a bit more into repairs. If I had paid more for the car, it may not have been worth it.

I would recommend that anyone considering buying this car take a very close look under the hood before making your decision. Check for newly replaced parts, and especially for white stains where something obviously ran down the side of your motor. If you see these signs, be wary of this purchase because you may have costly repairs to look forward to.
