            1994 Mitsubishi Galant LS; sunroof, ABS, 15&quot; alloy rims, automatic.
     Bought this car used in 1998. It already had 106,000 miles, but ran perfectly besides clunking noise from the front suspension. Because Galants (1994-1998) use multilink front suspensions, there are 2 ball joints to worry about on each side. In my case I remember changing one of them on each side (about $90 each from the dealer - also see if covered by a recall for ball joints), along with stabilizer links (about $35 each), almost all bushings and all motor/tranny mounts. (Mounts are expensive! $50-70 each). I also changed all 4 struts, which was expensive but made the ride much more controlled (and much more stiff and therefore sporty)
     After the suspension was taken of, the driver's side power window regulator got annoying. It was obviously worn and tore the rubber window seal (which I glued back together myself after replacing the window regulator). To replace (which I did myself), it took a trip to the dealer and $120. Window regulator is sold only with the motor, so I had to pay for both.
     The antenna mast cost me $70 to replace, when someone broke it off while it was up.
     The rear suspension squeels because the bushing on top of the rear control arm (I believe?) is worn and I have to change the whole entire piece on each sided to remedy just the bushing. ($$$$ and lots of it). So let it squeek for now. 
     The car has 140,000 miles currently. I personally put about 30,000 in one year, mixed driving. The engine is starting to burn oil more. The problem seems to be the valve stems letting oil drip into the cylinder and burning with the gas. This is a problem on all Mitsubishi engines. Diamantes, Eclipses and older-generation Galants are often the ones with thick blue smoke from the exhaust pipe. However, 140,000 on the original engine is not bad and I will not change the engine until it doesn't pass inspection any more (which it did a few months ago). Also the smoke seems to be visible only after idling for a long time (10 minutes or more) and never when driving. My mechanic predicts another 30,000 miles before engine rebuild.
     Gas mileage is great, even in the city, and the car goes 115mph with little difficulty. The transmission has &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; as mitsubishi calls it. It downshifts for you automatically when it thinks you want to slow down or keep the speed constant (i.e. down a hill). Tranny is pretty good at getting into the right gear at the right time, although it seems to hesitate to downshift more than one gear at a time, which could be annoying (but is the same way even the best GM and honda tranny's are). At 140,000 miles, the original transmission had its tune up only twice, and as long it had Chrysler oil in it (and not the Dextron Mercon latest), it will not slip and shift pretty smooth. Its obviously rougher than when it was new, but in no means unacceptable. Most people who drive lightly wont notice anything wrong with the tranny.
     Handling is great. I installed New BFgoodrich performance tires and those are a big improvement. What the car needs is a rear anti-roll bar. At high speed, the rear gets loose as soon as any maneuver is made. I believe the 1994-only GS models had the antiroll in the back straight from the factory. But that DOHC 160hp top-of-the-line model is VERY hard to find. For the normal trim-level Galant owners, I'd get an aftermarket anti-roll bar installed. Otherwise, the handling is save with very little oversteer (understeer is far more common). Brakes are good, as long as you use good brake pads (Mitsu originals are not bad).
     After a huge thunder storm I was forced to drive the Galant through a very large puddle of water. After that  the splashes apperantly messed up the A/C compressor clutch. The dealer wanted $1000 to fix the system, since 1994 A/C system is a one-year only (notice!) and apperantly not as good as a 1995+ A/C system. Instead I bought the $100 clutch for the compressor and had my mechanic install it and recharge the R134a gas.
     The car always started up with no problems. The power is decent and gear ratios fit the motor pretty well. Acceleration figures 0-60 are below 9 seconds for an automatic, which is good for a 3000lb sedan with 141 horsepower and 148 lb ft torque (which comes at a low 3000 rpm's). at 70 mph, rpm's are at about 3000. Overall, the engine/transmission is a good match for the car, just not as smooth as a heavier V6 (eventhough Mitsubishi uses its patented anti-vibration technology). On the other hand, Galants are much cheaper to buy used then Camry's, Accords and maxima's so its a good choice. just watch out for rattles in the suspensiom and blue smoke (esp. at idle). The car is reliable, besides the usual maintanance. Suspension is weak and breaks easier in NY city, but fine for normal smoother pavement with little potholes. 
Any questions?

Good luck<br><br>
