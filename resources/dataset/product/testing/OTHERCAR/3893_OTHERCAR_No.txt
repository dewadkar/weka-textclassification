            My 1st car was an 89 Horizon, I paid the whole 500 bucks myself.But my dad paid the eventual, enevitable hundreds of dollars in repairs.I know now, almost 4 years and several cars later, that buying a car off of someone's drivay or out of the want ad digest isnt always the smartest thing to do, but at the time, I didnt.

The car was cool at first...I loved it, it was my pri=de and Joy, but soon turned into the bane of my existance.It broke down all the time, and it seemed like every time i got something fixed on it, something else would immediatley break down, good for the greedy mechanic, bad for poor me.

At first, I tried to pay for all the repairs, my allowance, working for my dad on weekends, etc.. but then it got to be too much , and my dad started to pay for the expensive ones.

It all ended when oneday on the way home from school, the thing just flat out died,when i was in the middle of driving it mind you,almost killing me.

My friends mom had this car too, and it also gave her alot of problems like the ones I had, Alternator, Carborater, trasmision, etc.Just If your looking for a car for a teenager , or a car for yourself, and it has to be a cheap or older car... stay away from this one, and if you must get it , like you have some sentimentle attatchment to these God Awfu;l things, just get it checked out by at least three different swindlers, oops I mean mechanics, youll save alot of time money and aggrivation in the end.
