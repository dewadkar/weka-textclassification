            Well to start off with I am a 19 yr old from Arizona and recently traded in my Mitsubishi eclipse due to mechanical problems, I wanted something that looked good, had good pickup and of course something reliable. But ever since I have owned my 96 maxima se, 5spd I have been on cloud 9. It easily beats 80% of most cars on the road, it's quit, handles awesome, and most importantly is reliable. This car is definatly a sports car trapped in a 4 doors body. I actually look for places to go just so I can drive my car around town. I love this car and never plan to sell it, and if I do it will definatly be for another maxima. Ever since I laid eyes on this car I was impressed. From now on I will always own a maxima.<br><br>
