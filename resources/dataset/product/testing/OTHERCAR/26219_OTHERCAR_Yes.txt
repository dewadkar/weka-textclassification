            STRENGTHS:
I was going to buy a Merc M series until I took the X5 for a test drive. I also own a 750iL and 540i BMW and this little beast drives every bit as well as these higher-priced sedans. I was blown away. I am 6'6" tall and most vehicles make me feel cramped - I can sit tall in the X5 without having the seatback reclined. It's got heaps of power for the mountains where I live, steep winding slopes...no problem, just point the car where you want it to go and it does what it's told. It looks great (I've got a mahogany red one) with a nicely styled hood. In Australia the X5 only comes with a 4.4 litre motor (at this stage) and has 10 airbags standard. The integrated car phone is fantastic as is the digital audio processing sound system. I have only had to stand on the brakes once since I have owned it and it STOPPED in no distance. It is so quiet inside except for that subtle V8 hum when you push the pedal hard. The elevated seat position gives you fantastic road vision. My wife and I each have a coded car key that not only operates the central locking but sets up the electronically memorised seating position and steering column position. I like the way you start the car by just turning the ignition key without having to hold the key in the start position; the electronics crank the starter and then release it automatically when the motor turns over.


WEAKNESSES:
The rear seating only allows 3 passengers, so when you have more than 3 kids it creates some problems. Small cargo space, although you can stack up a fair bit with the cargo net that comes standard. The options added about 20% to the base price of the car. It sucks up premiun gas. I was disappointed about the limited colour choices available in Australia - the BMW website in Germany suggests a greater array of exterior and interior colour combinations. The X5 isn't a serious offroad vehicle but it handles the muddy dirt roads around where I live a lot better than a sedan.

SUMMARY:
City (not off-road) all-wheel drive vehicle with great vision from the elevated seat position. One of the safest vehicles ever built with multiple electronic drive assists, monocoque steel passenger shell, lots of airbags, great brakes, unique seatbelt tensioning system, antisubmarining seat design and serious BMW handling. Coded car keys automatically set up the electronic seating for each driver before you even get into the car. Parking distance sensors make it easy to avoid nudging other vehicles when parking. Rain sensors take care of the window wipers. The headlight washers keep the Xenon beam really bright, even on muddy roads. The integrated hands-free car phone is top quality (Motorola)and the dashboard display and steering wheel phone controls are incredibly convenient to use. The sound system is excellent and you have the choice of the 6-stack CD or cassette. The sunroof doesn't detract from the generous headroom but the electronically retractable side mirrors are a bit of a gimmick. The dashboard TV is handy to kill time while you're waiting in the car (obviously is inactivated whilst driving) and the optional rear DVD player and screen keeps the kids occupied on longer trips. I didn't get the SatNav system but it's available and affordable. It accelerates and handles like a sports car and rides like a 7-series BMW luxury sedan.
It's the best vehicle I have ever owned and will probably hold onto it for many years (and it will probably still drive like new as have other BMW's I have owned). Main drawbacks are V8 gas consumption and limited rear seating design (maximum of 5 persons in the vehicle).
