            It was time to buy a new digital camera.

My previous experience with digital cameras has been a "mixed positive" (I had a Polaroid PDC 640 which, though it took decent pictures, died twice...once while under warranty, and finally just after the warranty expired.)  I was left without a digital camera a month before my Honeymoon, for which I would be travelling to Italy and France.

Looking through the various selections the stores offered, I saw the S100 in all of them, and I have to admit...this camera impresses you much more when you're up close and personal.  Still, at $500, the camera didn't seem *THAT* great.  I kept looking, and managed to exhaust all the stores I knew of in the Atlanta area.

What finally did it for me was Epinions.  It seemed that all the cameras I was considering suffered from the same issue of how much time it took to take the picture.  I saw, however, that the S100 had a rechargeable battery, and the charger worked on foreign voltages (keeping fresh batteries was always a pain - not to mention somewhat expensive - in my old camera).  I also saw an opinion which mentioned that pressing the button halfway (allowing the camera to ready itself to take the photo) would usually allow the S100 to take pictures much more quickly.

On top of this, OfficeMax was offering a 32MB Compact Flash card free with the purchase of an S100.  This pretty much did it for me.  I went to the store only to find out that they were out of stock.  They referred me to one of the other stores, but I ended up walking down the block to Best Buy (they graciously offered to match the OfficeMax deal).

So I finally had my camera. 

I'll skip my moments of discovery now, and give you all the poop I've gathered over a month of extensive use.

First, the speed issue does exist...sort of.  This really only seems to affect me when I have to pull out the camera, turn it on, point it at the subject and snap the photo.  If I'm already taking pictures, there really isn't a problem.  I've conditioned myself to press the button halfway while I'm framing the shot, so the camera has already decided what it needs to do to give you a great picture by the time I snap the pic.  To me, this really isn't an issue anymore.

The only thing that I would say *is* an issue is the battery.  Depending on flash use, the resolution of the pictures and whether you're using the LCD, a full charge on the battery usually lasted me one day's use (though usually a full day and a full CF card).  The only time I've actually run out of power was while taking pictures of the Colloseum, but once was enough.  The other issue with the battery is that you have to take it out of the camera to charge it.  Not a huge pain, but enough to deserve mention here.  Unfortunately, if you want to use a power adapter with the camera, you have to purchase it separately, and it *replaces* the battery.  Not the best of designs, but I suppose they had to do some magic to get the whole thing into that small case in the first place.  Beyond the issue of the battery, I have no complaints.

Now for the good stuff.

The camera takes great pictures.  The normal mode allows the camera to select everything, which makes it "point and shoot".  Left like this, it takes pictures every bit as well as most 35mm cameras, and has the advantage of 2x optical and 4x digital zoom (giving you up to 8x zoom).  This will pretty much give you a picture which looks exactly the same as what you see with your eye (equivalent to about an 80mm zoom on a 35mm camera).

You can also choose to fiddle with the settings a bit in manual mode.  This lets you set the exposure up or down a couple of notches (though it doesn't tell you exactly how much one of their notches equates to) or set the white balance (so you don't have green pictures in flourescent lighting situations).  You can choose black & white pictures, or it even helps you create panoramic shots by displaying part of the previous picture...allowing you to line everything up correctly.

It's normal resolution is 1600x1200 and it stores the images as JPG on the card.  The camera estimates 52 images will fit on my 32MB card (though it can vary by a picture or two either way, depending on the composition of the photos).  You can choose to lower the compression rate for the images (which then gives you about 20 images on a 32MB card) or lower the resolution to 640x480 (180 images).  For the most part, I leave it in standard resolution.

The camera will allow you to output the LCD image to a television, and even allows you to create a sort of slideshow.  Of course you can review and delete any or all the images currently on the Compact Flash card.

Other features allow you to rotate the image 90 degrees in either direction (but you can't flip it 180 degrees for some reason), or set the print order for hardware and applications which follow the Digital Print Order Format (DPOF) specifications, such as Polaroid's new P-500 photo printer (probably my next purchase...).

You also have several options for the flash.  By turning it off completely (and holding the camera very still) you can get some great shots, even in low light.  To compliment this, there is a starlight setting, which will flash to get the foreground subject, but will also give enough exposure to get low-light backgrounds.  Of course, there's also red-eye reduction and a setting for your regular old blinding flash.

The camera will allow macro images (though I've noticed the flash will usually wash these out if you're not careful) and distance images, but I've not had to play with that yet.

Like the title of the opinion says, this camera will get you noticed.  While on my honeymoon, I had several people come up to me to ask me where I got it and how much it cost (not easy when they can barely speak English and I can barely speak Italian or French).

Finally, I wanted to close up with a note that, despite its size, the S100 is an extremely durable camera.  I've dropped it a few times (if you know me, this won't surprise you) and it hasn't suffered more than a scratch.  I obviously wouldn't recommend making a habit of dropping it, but it's always nice to know that you didn't just flush $500 down the toilet because you bent over with this thing in your shirt pocket.

Overall, I have to give the camera my recommendation.  The battery issue is offset somewhat by the fact that it *is* rechargeable, and the charge usually lasts through the day.  Since that was my major concern, everything else for the camera is a plus.  I've taken about 800 pictures with it so far, and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.

Now go out and get your own.
