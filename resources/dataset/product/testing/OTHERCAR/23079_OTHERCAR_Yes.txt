            I received this camera as a birthday gift. It�s a great camera for the price, though there are a few things with with it. When taking pictures of objects close up, the flash is always way too bright,even on the up-close setting. If you turn the flash off, of course, it is way too dark. The lighting is hard to get just right.  Taking pictures from far away (3+ feet) produces, grainy, fuzzy, discolored and dark images.
The camera hogs batteries, so it�s a very good idea to use the outlet adapter whenever possible. There is also no zoom, which is a big drawback.
Customer service was also very friendly &amp; helpful.

Overall, it�s a good camera for the price, especially for beginners, but if you can afford it,you�re best off with a different &amp; better one.
