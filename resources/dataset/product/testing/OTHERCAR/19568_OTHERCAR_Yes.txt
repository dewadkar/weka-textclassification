            Words cannot explain the excitement this automobile brings to this family, every day! We, a family of 5, drove in the most basic model Isuzu Rodeo for 2ï¿½ years while the entire time wanting a Chevy Suburban. Now that we finally got it, we can't imagine how we ever did without it!

We bought our 1999 Suburban over the internet in one transaction. It was the easiest auto purchase we've ever had. Which, by the way, made getting this wonderful auto much sweeter! It took just about 4 hours on a Saturday no less. Got there, signed and drove off the lot in 30 minutes! Try it yourself. 

O.k., O.k.! So you want to actually know about this auto. Ours has seating for the driver and 7 passengers. It has a total of 12 cups holders! Which was exciting for us, because we drove without ANY before! It has electric windows and locks, of course. It also has an electric door lock (like the regular door locks) in the very back cargo area for locking the doors. 

It has seat belt aids and the actual seat belt can be positioned higher or lower. The seat belt aids are cool because our almost 6 year old is sitting in a &quot;booster&quot; seat, which has left him strangled by seat belts in the past. The seat belt slides into these aids and guides the belt off the neck and more toward the should like it should fit. The aids are connected to the side of the seat by velcro and can be removed easily.

Of course this next item is pretty standard with the larger vehicles in this class, but it's worth mentioning. The air conditioning has 2 separate controls for front and back. The control for the back is set by either the middle set of seats or can be controlled by the driver/passenger in the front seats. This is especially nice considering I have kids that are &quot;too hot&quot; or &quot;too cold&quot; when I happen to be just right!

It also rides like a dream &amp; I feel very safe now. While the Isuzu was, I guess it's safe to say, like riding in a tin can. Also, before trading our Rodeo, we had new tires put on it. We thought it would help with the road noise, but it never did. NOW though, the ride is nice and smooth &amp; I can hear the boys in the back just fine. I sometimes pretend I can't hear them though. It's nice to have that option, whereas before I had no choice. Before, screaming was the way to communicate in the car!

One downfall we've had is that we haven't figured out the child lock yet. Thank goodness this auto is so big, that the &quot;unlocker&quot; now sits in the back without access to a door! We've only had it for 2 weeks. Maybe it will come to us!

Another downfall is that we have trouble pushing the seat forward to access the back seats. Now, this may be a glitch on our part, but there doesn't seem to be an access lever to do this from the very back seats. From the angle I have to move the seat, it would be easier if the kids could let themselves out instead!

Well, overall we had a great experience with our Suburban! We logged on to www.autonation.com and found our 1999 Chevy Suburban with 43,000 miles for only $23,900. Of course we got the extended warranty: 5 years or 60,000 miles! They told us at the dealership that they have INTERNET SPECIALS all the time and that on the lot, this vehicle was set at $5,500 more, almost $30,000. If you're in North Texas, look up Jim Johnston at Bankston Lincoln*Mercury. He made buying the Suburban peaceful! 

We love our car!<br><br>
