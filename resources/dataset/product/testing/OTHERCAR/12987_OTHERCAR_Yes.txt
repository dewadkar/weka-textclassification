            For the abuse I put this car through I am actually surprised it hasn't decided to just take off in the middle of the night. I purchased a base model with no power steering. I find it odd to have a car produced these days without power steering but I guess I'm just spoiled. The interior is roomy for a compact car and it is compact. I've maneuvered into spaces I know were not really meant for a car to fit in. Being a light car, hence the excellent gas mileage, it's only real problem with handling is staying tight in the corners. But a little skipping out is to be expected and all in all it holds the road very well. I will go through my first winter with this car this year so I will see how it handles in the snow. So far, once I built up my muscles, the handling was fine on wet roads as long as I weighted the trunk. For the price, it's an excellent buy and the warranty is killer. 
Update: I just took this car on a 1200 mile trek for the holidays. All I can say is it was comfortable the whole way and the handling ability of the car is the only thing that kept me out of a 14 car pile-up. I was one of only 2 cars that managed to dodge everyone and not get hit when the whole pack lost it on the bridge! <br><br>
