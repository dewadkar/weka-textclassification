            While I've only had my 2000 Dakota ClubCab SLT 4x4 (with 4.7 V8 and auto) for about a week, I am very pleased so far.  The other reviewers have already pointed out the downsides of this truck (i.e., poor gas mileage...I also get about 12-13 mpg in mostly city driving) and I have noticed that the transmission is a bit sloppy in shifting (I wish first gear were a bit lower) and the brakes are softer than they should be.  But in terms of comfort, utility, ride and handling and power, this is a fantastic truck.  The 4.7 makes a LOT of power and likes to be pushed hard, the interior is carlike in its comfort and features (this is a very well designed vehicle...its far more user friendly than any other pickup I've been in) and its the perfect size for most uses.  While I can't fit my truck in my garage, I think that anything smaller would make for a limited use truck and anything larger would be a waste.  

I was going back and forth between this truck and a similarly equipped Ranger.  What sold me on the Dodge (and I'm a lifelong Ford guy) was the V8, the increased size and the more modern design.  Even my wife, who has no interest in trucks and didn't understand why I was buying this one, has come out as a fan.  

As long as you can live with the poor gas mileage this is the perfect choice.


UPDATE DATED FEBRUARY 21, 2001

I've now had this truck for about 8 months and I'm still very satisfied overall.  So far I have had no real problems but there are a few things that are annoying.  One is the gas mileage.  It continues to hover in the 10-12 mpg range in the city and the 15-16 on the road.  The transmission is also something I'm not too thrilled about.  It tends to shift quite roughly on the 1-2 shift, especially when cold.  In fact, it feels like it's slipping, though I understand that this is something a lot of people complain about and the factory response (naturally) is "that's the way the transmission works."  I'd prefer a transmission that was designed to shift smoothly.  The final annoying area is the fan operation when cold.  The engine tends to roar excessively for the first few minutes and it seems to operate at lower power levels.  Aside from those gripes, I'm still very impressed with what Dodge has done.  I recently rented a new Explorer and it reminded me how good the Dakota is.  The Explorer is gutless, tinny, uncomfortable and handles like a pendulum; the Dakota is very powerful, comfortable, solid and for a truck it handles superbly (is that a word?).  In an attempt to remedy the mileage issue, I installed an Airaid air filter kit.  It seems to have bumped up the mileage by about 10-15% across the board (though it is still too early to know for sure) and it clearly opened up the powerband.  There's not much of a difference at low speeds but at higher speeds its a huge change.  This truck now rushes from 55 or so to 85+mph, where it used to struggle a bit in that range.  

FURTHER UPDATE DATED AUGUST 20, 2001:
Since my last update I've had one more modification made to the truck.  A few months ago I had a catback exhaust system installed (it is a replacement of the exhaust system from the catalytic convertor back...in this case, I had a dual exhaust system put on with Flomaster 40 series mufflers exiting out the back with 2 1/4 inch tips).  The new exhaust system is AMAZING.  Ignore anyone who says that modern motors don't benefit from new exhaust systems.  First, the sound of the motor went from tame to THROATY.  It sounds like a real V8 now and I still smile when I step on the gas or start it up and hear that great American noise.  Second, and more important, I am getting 1 mpg better in town and 3 mpg better on the road.  I drove the truck up to Lake Tahoe from SF a day after the system was installed and I averaged 20 mpg...this was on a day when the traffic from SF to Sacramento was stop and go, I drove around Sacramento city streets for 20 miles and I went flying through the Sierras with a heavy foot (and then did some tame off roading around Fallen Leaf Lake).  I was absolutely shocked that I could get such a huge increase in mileage with all the extra power.  I absolutely, 100% urge anyone with a 4.7 Dakota to get this modification done.  It turns a good thing into a great thing.

Other than that, there hasn't been much to report.  No problems, no issues.  The one minor complaint I have is that there is an odd rattling noise coming from the truck at times.  It sounds like pebbles in a tin cup.  It's annoying but it hasn't caused any problems yet.  Though I am probably wrong, I suspect that what is happening is that the tires are kicking up small rocks and throwing them against the wheel wells.  I'll keep an eye on this one.
