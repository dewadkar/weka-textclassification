            Here is my update I promised you (referring to my initial review titled "First Impression....Wow").  While reading this review keep in mind my saga with digital cameras, which started around Christmas time.  Here is a quick refresher.  With a new baby in the family I thought it would be nice to get mom a digital camera for Christmas.  Not knowing much about digital cameras I spent 2 weeks going from store to store getting sales reps. opinions on cameras.  The first camera I settled on was the 2.3 mega-pixel Toshiba PDR-M60 (see my review on the Toshiba PDR-M60).  The Toshiba took excellent pictures but the camera casing felt cheap.  Basically giving you the "I'm gonna break when the warranty is up feeling".  The Toshiba also used AA batteries which when taking pictures on high resolution lasts about 50-60 pics, even less with the screen on.  I then traded the Toshiba in for a 1.3 mega-pixel Sony DSC-S30.  The S30 came with a rechargeable battery and had a durable case.  Overall I liked the S30 but the pictures, especially in-doors and in low light, were not as crisps and clear as the Toshiba.  In hopes of gaining better picture quality, plus the ability to take minute long videos, I returned the S30 and ordered the S50 from an online retailer (but that is another story all together).  After my first weekend with the S50 I was impressed and left my first review titles "First Impression....Wow".  This is an update on that review.

The Sony DSC-S50 is a great all around camera.  Keep in mind the Toshiba and the Sony DSC-S30 both cost $400.  However the DSC-S50 costs around $600.  As far as durability and features you can not go wrong with the Sony.  

The rechargeable battery is the best.  It really does last.  I have taken almost 200 pics and 15 videos and still have 100 minutes of battery life left.  The battery even recharges while still in the camera.  While others have complained about Sony's flip screen monitor and the lack of a viewfinder, claiming that in bright conditions the screen is hard to see.  I have not run into this yet and we have had some really sunny days in Florida!  I also like how the buttons on the back of the camera are laid out.  They allow for easy access while taking pictures or videos.  

The camera comes with plenty of features, too many to list.  However the ability to record 1 minute long videos is great.  While they are not the best quality they are perfect for email.  Grandma cried when she saw her granddaughter eat cereal for the first time in a video I was able to send within minutes of the actual event.  

I do have one low point to the camera.  We buy cameras to take pictures and the Sony S50 takes good pictures.  However they are not excellent.  If only the Sony S50 had the optics the Toshiba PDR-M60 has.  The S50 takes the same quality image as the S30.  Simply put if you are looking for excellent quality images with clear resolution and bright vivid colors SAVE $200 and buy the Toshiba PDR-M60.  If the Toshiba had a better case or a rechargeable battery I would still own it!  However is you are a gadget person who loves toys the DSC-S50 is the camera for you!
