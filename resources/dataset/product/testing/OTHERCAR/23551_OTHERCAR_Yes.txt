            My wife uses this vehicle primarily as a minivan to haul our family and their stuff.
It holds everything with room to spare, even with the third row seat up.  
Every seat is comfortable with good legroom, headroom, shoulder-room and hip-room -- even in the third row.  
Prior to this purchase, I was sold on Japanese vehicles.  I was a little apprehensive about this Chevy.  
The Suburban now has 6000 miles on it, and, so far, I have no regrets.  No problems yet.
It has a very nice, quiet ride.  It is neither bouncy or harsh.  It has a remarkable, car-like ride.  
And, it has a very small turning radius in spite of its size.  You CAN park it in a crowded lot, and on the first attempt.  
It also gets decent mileage -- about 15 MPG in mixed driving.  Better MPG than my old Toyota SUV that was half the size and only had a 6 cyl engine.
The fit and finish appear to be OK -- better than my old GM products.
The only significant complaints I have are directed to the dashboard and center console.  They are made of "cheap" plastic.  The center console, for example, is hard as a rock with a nice ridge around its perimeter -- it is not a friendly place to rest your arm during long trips.  
The radio is OK, but nothing to write home about.
The Suburban LT comes with front and side air bags, but no curtain air bags or vehicle skid control (which are available on many of its competitors).  
I also considered:
Toyota LandCruiser (too small, too expensive)
Toyota Sequoia (it came down to this or the Suburban; the Suburban won out because it was a little bigger; had more legroom and headroom in the 3d row; had much more storage room behind the 3d row; was thousands cheaper; had better visibility; but had the same turning radius) 
Lincoln Navigator (too small)
Ford Excursion (way too big, impossible to park, no visibility)

Update (Aug, 2001):  The Suburban now has 11,000 miles on it.  We have had absolutely no problems with it.  So far, so good.  In fact, very good.  My wife absolutely loves it.

Update (May 2003): The Suburban now has 33,000 miles on it.  It is starting to show its first signs of what I consider GM trademarks, e.g, some plastic trim pieces around the seats have fallen off, the electric driver seat is sporadic, the local dealer is bickering over fixing such things under warranty (or, with respect to the seat, he pretends he can't duplicate the problem when it is in the shop - despite being shown the problem when we drive in).  Mechanically, however, we have had no problems.  It is still a pleasure to drive and is still solid.  At this point, I would not hesitate to buy another.  Also, we had a ton of snow this past season.  The auto 4 wheel drive feature worked flawlessly.
