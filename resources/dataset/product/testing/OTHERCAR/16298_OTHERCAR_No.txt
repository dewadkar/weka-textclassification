            My husband and I have been wanting to buy a digital camera for quite a while now.  I wanted to e-mail pictures of my kids, and he wanted to put up pictures of his &quot;Transformers&quot; for auction.  

After doing some research... some of it, right here at Epinions, I hit the stores to do some hands on testing.  The sales people were very patient as I tried every single camera under $500, even a few that went over because they were so cool looking.  I finally broke down and bought the one I thought would be the best for our uses, the HP/C200.  I was nervous about purchasing a camera that wasn't made by a camera company, but my nerves have been eased over the past week.  The pictures are saved as JPGs and are incredibly clear and detailed without being large at all.  This makes it just perfect for using in e-mail and posting to auction web pages.

It uses the Compact Flash storage media which I felt was better than the Smart Card or the Memory stick for a number of reasons.  It also uses 4 AA batteries.  This was a MAJOR plus since so many of the others used special batteries that cost a fortune.  The size is just right.  It is shaped exactly like my 35mm camera and weighs the same.  I am really pleased with photography settings (such as exposure time), auto focus, auto-timer and the built in flash with red-eye reduction.  I wish that it had through the lens viewing instead of the seperate view finder because I keep getting my fingers in the shots, but vigilance will fix that. :)  Not that I get to use it much since the kids have become VERY interested in photography now that they don't have to pay for film processing.

I think anyone who is just starting in photography should invest in this camera.  There are much less expensive ones, but if you hope to increase your skills this is the one for you.  Also anyone who will be taking many pictures, new parents, new pet owners, travelers would do well with this camera.<br><br>
