            For years my husband and I planned to travel the areas of the USA that interested us. We went looking for a van with a price limit that we could afford and wanted a nice looking van that got good gas mileage and had eliminated the colors that we didn't want to purchase.  I guess we didn't want much!  We were fortunate to find exactly what we wanted!  We have traveled 9,000 miles in a 6 month span and we found the only disadvantage is we needed a step stool for anyone elderly or disabled to get into it.  Once in the van it becomes a very comfortable smooth ride.  We averaged 30mpg on the trips we made during this time.  We took out some of the removable seats to bring everything but the kitchen sink to make our trip comfortable for us.  The car ran smooth enough to make coffee while we were driving.  Part of our trip was in the summer and through southern states; and the tinted windows was a plus.  Our model has the two sliding doors for easy entry and exit.  We certainly recommend the Chevy Venture mini-van for all around use for home and travel.  One thing we also like is that the new ones have the same styling and many mistake our 1998 for the 2001 model.
