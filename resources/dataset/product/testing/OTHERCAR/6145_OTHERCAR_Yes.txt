            Chevy reintroduces their Impala with its 2000 model year. This 6 passenger &quot;luxury&quot; car is Chevrolet's biggest model. However, it is definitely NOT your father's old Impala from the 70's.

The Impala comes fully loaded from safety features to today's must-have &quot;extras.&quot; The ride is exceptionally smooth and quiet. With a powerful V6 engine, acceleration is a dream and before you know it you're flying down the highway. All the more reason to use the cruise control, as 65 in this car only feels like you're doing 45. Before you realize it, you're doing 90 and the lights &amp; sirens will be pulling you over!

Sound system is above average and the CD upgrade is worth the extra cost. Everything is computerized and well laid out. Storage space is plentiful. Handles well in all conditions. Gas mileage is good (20/32) for a luxury car but be prepared to spend more at the pump to fill this car's tank. Cost is &quot;up there&quot; but not out of line with others mid-size luxury cars.

Today's new chevy is definitely worth the test drive :-)<br><br>
