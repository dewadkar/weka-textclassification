                I will pay off my Toyota Camry in February 2001 and it has been worth every penny. This car is one of the most reliable cars on the road and is always a best buy in Consumer Reports. I bought this car in 1996 when it was 4 years old (1992) and since then, the only thing that has gone wrong were replacement of the spark plugs and some electrical work. It is a car you can become quickly attached to and if this car dies, another Camry will be right at the top of my list.
    One great thing about this car is the radio protection. Since I bought this car used, I did not have the ID number to unlock the radio. My battery died and had to be replaced. After it was replaced, the radio did not work. I bought this to the Toyota dealer and they made it work for free. I appreciate that kind of customer service (since I am in college the money aspect was nice).
    Driving this vehicle is one of the best aspects of the car. It has a nice smooth ride with a great radio/cassette. I would recommend that families with 2 children buy this car or for the younger crowd (I am 22- I was able to afford this expense by a good deal) if money is not a problem, take a shot- advice wise- join the Toyota club at toyota.com. If there is a problem such as a missing owner's manual or to look up a maintenance problem the site is worth it. Another piece of advice is as all cars should- change the oil every 3 months or 3,000 miles. Good luck with your car selection- comments are welcome.<br><br>
