            This would not have been my first choice in a vehicle.  I've always thought they were cute but never planned on owning one.  

A family member purchased a Neon and, after about five months, decided it didn't suit her needs.  Knowing that I had a 10 year old Toyota that was <i>finally</i> starting to die a slow death, she approached me and asked if I'd like to take over the payments.  To make a long story short, I agreed and it was probably one of the worst decisions I've ever made.

<i>Before I begin the actual review of this product, I would like to state that this vehicle has been serviced properly and regularly from day one.</i> 

For the first couple of months, there were no problems at all.  The vehicle was easy to maneuver and drove smooth, even through bumpy construction areas. I got good gas mileage.  All was well and I was pleased.

After the second or third month, I noticed that when it rains, the brakes squeal horribly.  It's so bad that I'm embarrassed to pull out of the parking lot at work after a rain because people begin scurrying in fear.  I asked my brother, who's quite knowledgeable of the workings of a vehicle, and he said it was the nature of some types of brakes these days.  Thinking he had no clue of what he was talking about, I took it in to be checked, just to be safe, and was told that the brakes were fine and the brake pads did not require a change, however, there was no explanation for the squealing noise.  The brakes still squeal after a rain, even if it had been parked during the rain.  The minute I put it in reverse with the brake pedal pressed, the brakes squeal.

I cannot keep this vehicle aligned either.  I've had three alignments and two tire rotations.  At first, I thought it was due to my bumpy ride, to and from work, through a stretch of highway that was under reconstruction.  That was two alignments ago.  The construction is complete, I've had a third alignment and the problem continues.  

During the winter months, I began having difficulties when starting the vehicle.  It would crank a few times then just click repeatedly.  Not knowing a whole lot about vehicles, I thought it was the battery.  I had my brother take a look at it.  It wasn't the battery.  The gas line was frozen.  He unfroze it and it started as normal.  Okay, so it was very cold and I didn't buy gas treatment.  I have since started doing so regularly so this means problem is corrected now, right?  Wrong!  Just the other morning, in fifty degree weather, I had the same problem but with it eventually starting without assistance.  I haven't had a chance to make that dreaded trip to the service department as of this date.

The gas mileage is horrible now and the vehicle has never had any real &quot;pick-up&quot;.  It's very difficult to gain speed, even up small hills, and it's even worse with the front and/or rear defrost activated.  I drove to Tennessee recently and a cyclist could have challenged my Neon on some of those mountainous stretches and gotten better speed than I did.  

The upholstery on the seats is simply ugly.  They look generic and cheap.

These are just a few of the many problems I've experienced with this vehicle.  The ride becomes less smooth with every day that passes.  I am not happy with Neons these days and I plan to make a new vehicle purchase within the next six to twelve months.  Needless to say, a Dodge Neon will <b>not</b> be on my list of choices.

The most upsetting thing about this entire purchase is the amount of money I dish out every month for this car.  These vehicles are suppose to be a decent ride for an affordable price.  For the payment I make on this vehicle, I could lease two Dodge Dakotas or purchase one Toyota Corolla with some extra cash to spare for gas.

I would not recommend the purchase of this vehicle to anyone unless they wanted a new vehicle and absolutely could not afford anything else.
