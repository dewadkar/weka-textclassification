            I own a dodge caravan with approximately 107,000 miles on the engine. I bought the vehicle because it is roomy and peppy (with the 3.3 ltr V6).
I like this vehicle because it has never failed me in summer or winter weather.  It is useable as a cargo van when the seats are removed.  There is really nothing bad I can say about the vehicle.  I like to drive the caravan because it sets high up with a good view in all directions.  Anyone with children needs this vehicle because it can carry 7-8 people and lots of luggage/gear.  The vehicle, even though a mini-van, is kind of large for those who are not good at parallel parking or have a small parking space.<br><br>
