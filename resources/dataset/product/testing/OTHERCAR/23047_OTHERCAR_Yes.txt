            This is a great camera, very easy to use &amp; the pictures come out clear, which with many digitals just doesn't happen. I only wish that I could print them (need better printer) instead of storing them all in my computer! I have a sister that lives in CA (I live in MA), and this is the quick way to keep her updated on her niece &amp; nephew. She e-mails me that the photos reach her looking terrific.

The brighter the day, the better the picture, though. I took a few pictures on a cloudy day &amp; they were not as precise, but still very good. You also need to stand at least 3 feet away from whatever you are taking a picture of, or it'll be blurry. The cameras are very lightweight &amp; that is where my problem was at the beginning. Every time I took a picture my finger would press the button w/ such weight that the camera would move &amp; the picture was shaky. But after several attempts that is not happening anymore.

Just having the camera &amp; not having to get all the film developed is a convenience. There are a few places on line that you can send your film to, download it &amp; they will send you the pictures (for a fee of course). I haven't had it that long, have taken about 160 pictures so far, each better than the last. But all in all, I am extremely pleased w/ this camera. Brings a great big SMILE to my face!<br><br>
