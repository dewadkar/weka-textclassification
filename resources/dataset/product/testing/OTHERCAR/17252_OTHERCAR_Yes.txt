            Chrysler finally did a pretty good job on a completely redesigned car with the Dodge Intrepid.  I currently have 9000 miles on it and not a single problem.  One of the major criticisms I've always had with Chrysler cars (I've owned 4 prior to this one) was a severe lack of refinement in build quality.  Walk around the Intrepid and you will notice a harmonious flow from the Bumper to the fender with only a slight crease to show where both parts meet.  That same fluidity shows inside as well where there are very few gaps between interior body panels. The dash board is very modern in design and extremely practical, no controls are ever out of reach.  I have only two criticisms about the interior:  1) The white gauges, in the daytime, seem a bit out of place in comparison with the rest of the dashboard.  However, at night the white gauges are gorgeous with their white numbers on a black background.  2)  There is just way too much hard cheap plastic in this car.  I think as a general rule of thumb, Chrysler should absolutely minimize the use of hard plastic on anything at or above the steering wheel.   Use the cheap stuff ONLY on the lower end of the dashboard and doors (ie. everything below your elbows as you sit in the car). 

This car drives very well.  Engine noise at cruising speeds is very low.  it only gets noisy, but not annoyingly, if you floor it.  However, over grainy roads, tire noise gets a little intrusive. Acceleration is adequate and the transmission shifts very smoothly most of the time.  I love the AutoStick, which I use primarily for downshifting to slow down the vehicle.  The seats are very comfortable, I chose the leather option with manual lumbar support, although a tad more shoulder support would be nice.  I had the opportunity to take this car on a drive from NY to Wisconsin with my wife and 17 month old son and found it extremely comfortable.  The sound system on the ES is excellent as is the automatic climate control system.
   
One very annoying aspect of this car is rear visibility when backing up to park, it is a guessing game, I have to get out of the vehicle frequently to see how close I am.  I am currently looking into a backup sensor for this vehicle and by the way...Chrysler if you're listening OFFER ONE as an option on all LH cars.  

Once again, I think Chrysler did a pretty good job on these new LH cars.  You probably won't win any races in this car but if you're looking for a comfortable, affordable family sedan with tons of style and space, give this car a look.  I am certainly enjoying it.

Update 11/2/00

I have 18000 miles on my Intrepid and no problems whatsoever.  The car feels very solid.  There is a minor intermittent squeak coming from the dashboard but nothing that will drive me crazy.  My opinion of this car still stands that it is a very nice, reliable family car.  <br><br>
