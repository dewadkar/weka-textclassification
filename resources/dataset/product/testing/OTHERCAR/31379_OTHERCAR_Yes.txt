                When my dad got a new Lexus, we didn't want to drive it for a long distance, in case we might get into an accident or put mileage on a new car, so we decided to rent a decent car for 10 hours of driving back and forth. 
    As soon as we got into the car, we noticed the roominess, it was one of the roomiest compact car we ever been into, and we quickly noticed the cheap plastic that was used for the ergonomics, though we did not care for it much because it was only a renting car. 
   
    Many people describe the Alero as distinctively styled vehicle, but I apparently think it is very unstylish, not because of this experience but when it first came out, I just thought that the rear lights were over-sized and the car looked somewhat uneven, I guess everyone has different taste since I like Mercury Sable's style and majority people doesn't. 

     I was sitting in the back middle seat. after 3 hours of driving, my back was very very uncomfortable and after another hour, my hip felt like it was going to fall off, the rear middle seat is very stiff and hard. you just cannot sit there for more than 4 hours. (if you don't believe how serious I am, I encourage you to try it.)

     I've driven Pontiac Grand Am and Buick Century which are same car as Oldsmobile Alero...the Grand Am felt like I was driving more of Sport coupe because of its interior design and Buick Century felt like I was driving an older generations car, Oldsmobile Alero is little bit of both.
     Alero's exterior I guess was suppose to look sporty (which I find very unattractive) and interior was suppose to be a buick-like. notice I dont use the word &quot;luxury&quot;
     since GLS is top of Alero, most things were all standards: A/C, power locks/doors, ABS, CD player, Dual AirBag(I think it's standard even in the base model), leather, remote trunk open, cruise control...Almost everything you need is in GLS with 170 horsepower.
   
     I just think that there are MUCH more alternatives towards this vehicle. I just don't find anything special or attractive about this vehicle. The vehicle was fairly noisy inside, though it was in smooth side of ride quality. If you want to buy a vehicle in this class, I would recommend other cars like Hyundai Sonata (silky smooth and refined, long warranty), Nissan Altima (similar price, better performance), If you are type of person that only buys domestic then I would try Ford Contour or Used Mercury Sable/ Taurus (suprisingly good)...Just try them and if you still like Alero for some reason...then it is your choice...<br><br>
