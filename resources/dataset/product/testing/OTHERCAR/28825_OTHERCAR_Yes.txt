            I had purchased the Kodak DC210 Plus after reading several reviews on digital cameras.  This is a very nice, compact, lightweight camera that takes great pictures.  There is a 2x digital zoom, and it has a 1.8&quot; LCD panel that you can use to view and edit your pictures after taking them.  You can also use the LCD panel as the viewfinder, but being as small as it is, the subject tends to be a bit muddy.  After taking a picture, you can delete them, add borders, zoom in, add a date/time stamp and move the pictures around.  There are a TON of other features on this camera.  It comes with the AC adapter and an NTSC/PAL cable so that you can plug your camera into your television set and see the pictures there.  It comes with a nice software bundle to help you edit and view your pictures on your PC.  It also comes standard with an 8MB Kodak Picturecard that will hold about 25 pictures on high quality before having to 'unload.'  I also really like the fact that the camera takes pictures in jpeg format (along with several others).  This means that if you are using this to take pictures for a web page, there is no conversion process.  I have found that on average it takes about 12 - 15 seconds to write the image to the card after the picture is taken.  Not bad considering my other digital camera takes at least twice as long.  There are a couple of negatives though.  This thing will go through alkaline batteries like you would not believe.  I would highly recommend that you purchase NiMH recharables.  It also takes a while to download the images from the camera to the PC through the serial camera.  But boy, is it ever worth the wait.  Once you see how clear the photos are and how true the colors are, you will know why this is such a great camera.  You can visit Kodaks site (www.kodak.com) for more information.  I purchased my camera on BUY.COM.  Would highly recommend them for purchases of just about anything.<br><br>
