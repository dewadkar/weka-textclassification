Two words. Resale value. That just about sums up the reason why I purchased the Toyota Corolla. The corolla like all the Toyota models holds its price very well in the second-hand market. I guess that has something to do with a reputation for reliability that these cars have built up over the last so many years. Since this was the first car I was buying I needed  a vehicle which would take a few knocks without getting its price knocked off. I did not really go for looks or performance, just went ahead and purchased this car. But in the back of my mind I always knew I would get rid of it real fast. 
The Toyota to me is like an office PC. A piece of equipment we cant do without but not one that we are going to fall in love with. It is a good car and I ended up doing 25,000 kms in 9 monhts. No trouble. Just regular service and got a few scratches for my trouble of being a newbie on the road. In all that I did not feel at all remorsefull when I got rid of the car...in fact I was quite glad to sell it off. It was like I had finished my apprenticship in that car and was now looking to move onto something bigger and nastier. The car always felt very plastic with its unimaginative interiors and almost tacky sound system. The seat are okay though they could have done with a little more cushioning. 
The car does not even look good with its odd-shaped headlamps and droopy facade. I dont know what Toyota designers where thinking when they were building this one, but one thing I do not they obviously do not bother too much about the design.
Buy this if you are a newbie like me. but if you are looking for fun forget it.<br><br>
