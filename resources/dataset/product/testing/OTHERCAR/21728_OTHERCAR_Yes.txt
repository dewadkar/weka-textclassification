            I have a 98 Cavalier LS, 2 door. The main reason I bought it new, was because I was getting tire of going out to my old vehicle and wondering if it was going to start that day. I figured it was time for my first new car. I went with the Cavalier because it was inexpensive but still looked sporty. I believe mine came to $13,800. I now currently have 39,000 mile on it and the only thing I have had to do is put new front brakes on it.(which I haven't done yet..but need too) It is great on gas, and it has a strong 4-cylinder fuel injected motor. There is one little thing that I noticed would have to be fixed right away. When it is raining out, you cant really roll the window down even a little bit without the water coming inside the door. However, it is an easy fix. I went down and ordered some rain-guards for both doors, and that solved the problem. Other than that, I feel the Cavalier is a well put together car, for its price. It makes an excellent first car for anyone.<br><br>
