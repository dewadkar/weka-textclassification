            I recently purchased the Sony MVC-FD83 digital camera from an online retailer after looking at several other similar cameras from competitors such as Olympia, Canon, Nikon, and Sharp. I chose the Sony unit mainly because of its ease of use and the stored images are transfered directly to a PC from a standard floppy disk. 

The LCD screen and flash operations are excellent as are the camera's zoom and audio features. At the time of purchase, this unit retailed for $699.00 which also includes a battery and charger. A single battery charge will typically last 72 minutes depending upon the mode of operation you select. 

This camera basically has three modes of operation; still, movie, and playback modes. The movie mode allows up to 60 seconds of both video and audio and is only limited by the storage capacity of a floppy diskette (1.44Mb). A carrying case is also available for this camera for additional cost ranging from $29.99 to $59.00 as it is NOT included with the camera purchase. 

If you don't like using USB ports, cabling, and long picture download/transfer time, this camera is the way to go!<br><br>
