            I rented the saturn LS with the four cylender in base model trim with an automatic transmission.  I was very impressed with it.  for a 4 with under 140 horsepower, the engine was quite powerful.  It pulled like a small V6, and it was quiet too.  But for a 4, it sure got poor fuel mileage.  I drove on a 7 hour trip with my son on mostly west virginian mountain highways and I found it to be quite the comfortable car.  The cloth seats were comfortable, the standard CD stereo was VERY good, the A/C worked well, and there was noty a squeek or rattle.  It is also a good stealth speeder.  I got up to 80mph on the highway and I was not pulled over.  This is the best value for an under $20,000 sedan.  The base model is very enticing, but when you get up to the $25,000 fully loaded ones, you might as well get a honda accord.<br><br>
