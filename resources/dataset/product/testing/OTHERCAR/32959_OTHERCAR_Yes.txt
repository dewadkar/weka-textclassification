            I have had my Audi 100 for about two and a half years now.  It has been a great two and a half years.  The problems that I have had are limited and most of them are what would be considered regular maintenance.  It is a great driving car.  You won't be winning races from a traffic light all the time but there is plenty of power to get off the line in a respectable time.  Power on hills is also not a problem.  Even with only the front wheel drive model that I have it is still extremely sure footed in the snow.  


For the problems that I have had now: The first thing that I had to replace was the battery, I pulled out the original one, so I expected that would need replacing.  A non Audi battery is about 90 dollars for this car.  Then I needed to replace the front brakes, both pads and rotor.  This was in the 170 dollar range.  A starter was also needed and from an Audi online parts store costs about 180 dollars.  Then I had an alternator belt go bad only one year after it was changed, this caused my battery to drop to dangerously low levels while driving turning off un-needed electrical components and killing my ABS relay.  Then the exhaust needed to be replaced.  The original factory exhaust was pulled off at 105k miles and replaced with an after market system for around 350 dollars.  Rear brakes were then the problem with the slides freezing on the calipers, the result 170 dollars for pads and rotors, this is something that I knew would need attention well before they went.


Now here are some of the abnormal problems.  The re-circulation flat spring snapped.  This causes the windows to fog up if the conditions are of the right humidity when the temperature is less then 30 degrees.  This is only a 5 dollar part through a good online Audi parts store.  Then the drivers side door lock broke.  the piece that attaches the tumbler to the actual locking part broke due to its bad metal composition.  This means that the door had to be locked from the passenger side.  This is a 35 dollar part.


The car is great to drive though and extremely reliable.  In a one month period the car went on three 300 hundred mile each way trips with out stopping on each trip.  It was running in excellent shape when ever I got to eat destination.  It is a great car to drive on both back roads and highways, at above legal highway speeds it runs rock solid and pulls strong into a high rev band while in top gear.<br><br>
