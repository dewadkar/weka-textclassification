            I reallly do! How nice is theis car really! Just llok at it! A sporty look and great engine!he &quot;Luxury&quot; is covered by the 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, automatic climate control, fog lights, leather seats and other interior appointments. These are great seats, really. Even the back-seat is comfortable for adults. Lastly, for a convertible, it's a VERY quiet ride with the top up. I was amazed at that fact and it continues to impress me. The &quot;Individuality&quot; is covered by the fact that it's relatively uncommon. How  many Honda's do you not give a second glance to every day on the way to work. The distinctive &quot;roll bar&quot; and dual-exhaust keep it looking sharp, and most often, these babies have the striking color schemes to match. Mine is red with white top and white leather seats and black carpet for a nice 2-tone interior. I recoomend this baby to everybody!<br><br>
