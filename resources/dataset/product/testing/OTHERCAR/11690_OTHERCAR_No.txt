            I bought my 95 Land Rover Discovery used- she came with all documentation for every service she ever received- including detailing. I figured she was babied her entire life, and as such would be a breeze to maintain. Perhaps I should have looked more closely at the cost of those minimal repairs she received, but I fell in love with her at first sight. Within the first year of owning her (which was only two and a half years of her precious life), I had to replace the brakes, the complete exhaust system, put in a &quot;cold weather&quot; computer chip because she wasn't starting on cold days, and one of the tail lights blew out once a month like clock work until we moved to warmer climes. Sure, most used cars need some level of maintenance, but the severity of the repairs and the PAINFULLY high cost of parts and labor have made my beloved Land Rover a liability to my checkbook.

Additionally, her atrocious mileage leaves a lot to be desired- particularly in these days of high gas prices... not to mention the horrendous rape of the environment she's causing. Storage is so-so in the back, but her comfortable passenger capacity includes 5 full sized adults.

All that being said, she gives a wonderful ride- like a tank with springs- and she is certainly distinctive on the road, distinguishing herself among the masses of Grand Cherokees, Explorers, Navigators and the like on the highways today. She's great at off-roading, a joy to handle in any weather- including snow and ice. My husband was involved in an accident in her and, while the repairs were costly (to the other person's insurance company, anyway), she didn't require a huge number of repairs and she kept my husband safe and sound in her well-designed cockpit.

If you are looking for a distinctive and safe SUV, then the Discovery may be your choice. If maintenance costs and reliability are key, then perhaps the Discovery is not the choice SUV for you.<br><br>
