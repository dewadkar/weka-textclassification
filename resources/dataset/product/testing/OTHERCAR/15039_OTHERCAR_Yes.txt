             I have had my Mavica 73 for about six months, and it is one of the most delightful gifts I have ever given myself. I can't imagine using any other kind of camera. The serendipities are almost too numerous to mention.
 I was originally introduced to it by my daughter, who demonstrated one to me after borrowing it from a friend. She had told me how nice it was, but I had assumed it would be difficult to use. Several of my friends had other types of digital cameras, and it seemed to me they were forever crawling around on the floor to get to the backs of their computers, fiddling with cords and cables and expensive storage devices.
  To my surprise I discovered the Mavica was very easy to use, and I ordered one for myself. I was prepared to accept what I thought would be rather serious flaws--the weight and the lack of high resolution--because of the great ease of using ordinary floppies as storage devices. Again to my surprise, I found that the resolution was very good, and that the weight is not a problem at all.
   Recently a friend of mine phoned, asking if I had a scanner; he needed to send a picture of himself to a business firm he was joining. I said no, but offered to take a picture of him with the Mavica and e-mail it to the company. He was very pleased with the result.<br><br>
