            VW did very well with this vehicle. Co-designed by VW and Porsche, the Touareg is a bit more attractive from the front than the Porsche version, though it lack the Porsche Cayenne's powerful engine. 

I test drove and or researched a number of mid-sized SUVs before focusing on the Touareg. I preferred the power of the VW over the twin-turbo of the Volvo XC90. I preferred the standard side curtains and airbags of the VW over the Discovery offerings. Finally, the VW offers a number of other features as standard items rather than options. And at a price range between 36k and 60k, (low end V6 to loaded V8) it is an excellent value. 

The Touareg does offer with a navigation system as well as an in-dash CD Player. If you want you can have a CD changer installed in the rear. The upgraded sound system is very good. If you want to go deaf, you can chose to do so. 

If you are looking for a car or car-like SUV/truck then you do not want this vehicle. On the other hand, if you want a SUV or truck this is a quality vehicle. The ride is good for an SUV. The V8 is better than the V6 in terms of acceleration, but the V6 is certainly satisfactory. The car handles well and is surprisingly nimble. It is also sure footed in snow and slush. 

Some people want a third row and others do not. The Touareg does not offer a third row and as a result is roomy in the rear with very good storage space. The third row in vehicles such as the Explorer and Volvo were very limited. In fact, in Volvo's brochure, in tiny print, Volvo tells you that the third row is for small people or children. 

That said, the negatives that I have noticed are that it is difficult to look out of the rear view mirror because of the center headrest. (Remove it until you have someone riding in that location). Also, the electric fuel tank door on the vehicle I have is tempermental. That aside, I have no complaints about the vehicle.
