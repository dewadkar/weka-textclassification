            While this truck looks great and is the perfect size I have found that it is geared terribly. There is way to much torque and the rear wheels break loose very easily when in 2 wheel drive. I would not recommend this vehicle to the soccer mom or anyone that has a heavy foot on the gas pedal. I would however like to point out that it is great in 4 wheel drive and in mud and snow it just goes and goes. I am 6'8&quot; tall and weigh 314 pounds and I am quite comfortable in this truck. I also have a family of 5 and we all fit comfortably and can take long trips easily 
    WARNING: To first time owners/drivers of a 4 wheel drive vehicle. 
    4 wheel drive vehicles go great in bad road conditions but do not            STOP any better than a 2 wheel drive vehicle so be careful.
I own a 1999 Durango and I have had many problems with the computer and ignition system I can not say that it is wide spread but there is a bulletin out to the dealers about these problems and I am currently starting Lemon law proceedings. I will stick with the Durango as anyone can get a lemon from any manufacturer. I will let everyone know what transpires in the next few weeks after I contact Daimler-Chrysler on 12/20/99.<br><br>
