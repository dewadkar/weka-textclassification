            About four years ago, my mother purchased a 1996 Kia Sephia LS.  The first month, a little tiny plastic part which is part of the vacuum system broke.  This made the car unusable at first, but once it was turned off, she couldn't get it started again and was stranded as a local retail store.  After waiting a long time for a towtruck and making a trip to the dealer's shop, she was informed that they couldn't find the part and she wouldn't have a car to go anywhere until it could be shipped in from Kia motors.

That was the first indication that this car might not be put together all that well.  The next big ordeal my mom had and is currently trying to fix is that the dash board covering is pulling up from the body of the car!  At first we thought it could have been because the car was sitting in the sun sometimes, but my mom's friend who has a 1997 Sephia has been leaving hers in the sun just as my mothers and nothing like this is happening.  We've also looked around for other 1996 models and guess what?  The same thing is happening to a lot of other cars too.  We even asked one person about their dash and they said that they leave their car in the garage most of the time, so I think that this problem may be a manufacturer's defect.

Another thing I think is just plain cheap manufacturing is the headlights.  About a year after the car was purchased, the plastic covering the headlights started to get yellow, discolored, and very foggy.  What used to be excellent headlights are now so dull that people don't even flash you when you have your brights on because they can't tell.

Lastly, I know my mother doesn't have bad enough driving habits to make her brakes wear out so quickly.  I have a 1995 Ford Ranger and my brake pads are still the ones that came with the truck (although they made need replacing soon).  Trust me, my driving habits are a LOT worse than hers.  Right now, she has about 68,000 miles on the car and has had to replace the brake pads once already, with another replacement coming soon.

So you're thinking about buying a Kia?  Make darn sure that you don't buy their 1996 Sephia model.  Just to be safe, don't buy Kia.  I know my family hasn't had good experiences with them and I've heard many people not liking their's either because of all the problems they seem to have.<br><br>
