            The 3000GT was the flagship of Mitsubishi Motors in the 1990s. These cars have a very graceful yet aggressive body shape I have not seen in many other cars of this era. 

The base and SL model 3000GT are equipped with the extremely reliable Mitsubishi 6G72 6-cylinder engine, which makes 220 horsepower from the factory. Those 3000GTs that are still on the road are most likely still running strong with this reliable engine. These models are very well built, attractive, and sturdy. They are also heavier than most other cars, which may save your life in car accident. If you are the kind of person that likes to drive your car and never thinks about opening the hood, the base or SL model is for you.

I own the 3000GT VR-4 model. I wanted one the first time I saw it in 1991 and finally bought a used '93 model in 2000.

The VR-4 is at first glance a technological feat. The 6G72 here is equipped with dual TD04 turbochargers, which makes for 300 flywheel horsepower from the factory. The car has a tour/sport suspension mode, which can be selected on the fly for stiffer/looser response. The rear wheels turn in-phase with the front wheels up to several degrees to increase steering response. It also has real-time viscous coupling all-wheel-drive, which really is remarkable.

It handles and drives wonderfully. It can also be modified with aftermarket turbochargers, intercoolers, and so on, to make even more power.

This is all great of course, when it's not broken.

At second glance, the VR-4 is a poorly designed, poorly engineered, rushed product by Mitsubishi Motors. The TD04 turbochargers are woefully undersized for the engine, boost drops way off by 5,000 RPM leaving you with no power at higher rpms. The stock fuel injectors are 360cc and the fuel pump tiny, both are barely large enough to supply the fuel the engine demands at stock boost levels.

And the all-wheel-drive system. Woefully under-engineered and badly implemented. When it works, it works great, but it doesn't like to stay working. The 1991-1993 VR-4 had cast aluminum transfer cases, which are prone to leaking or cracking and breaking on UNMODIFIED cars. Mitsubishi just recently was forced to perform a recall on these transfer cases because of the oil leaks. The '91-'93 cars have small transaxle output shafts that are prone to stripping or shattering, even on unmodified cars. I have personally replaced my own output shaft twice. The transaxle has 1st and 2nd gear syncronizers that wear out very fast; this wouldn't be a problem if Mitsubishi sold you new ones, but they don't! Mitsubishi won't sell ANY parts for the 5 or 6 speed VR-4 transaxle at all! They'll be glad to sell you a completely new transaxle, though, at $5000 each.

All of this "technology" is crammed into an engine bay that was obviously designed by a staff artist, and not by the engineers. If you are not a seasoned mechanic, do not hatch the idea that you can repair your VR-4 without much hard work and research on your part. And be ready to part with a few bills, because Mitsubishi greatly overcharges you on replacement parts.
