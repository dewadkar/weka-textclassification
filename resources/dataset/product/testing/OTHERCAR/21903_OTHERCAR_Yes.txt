            BMW has mad great cars for over 30 years and they have really pushed the perfection on this model here. It is not only a great kids car because it is also safe it is also buissness or trip car.

This is not the avererage floating couch slow cruiser, this thing moves! I took a test drive in these fine car and and remembered to put my seat belt on soon as I hit the gas!

The 5 series is my best bet if you have a family of 4 and don't want a huge car, if so get the 5 series wagon. This car has been tested vs. the Mercedes E420 and many other fine German cars and had been voted the road&amp; track sedan of the year.

Of course since this car is German Made and has the BMW name on it, it is going to be pricy. But it is totally better than buying a Jaguar that is going to be in the shop every other day. This car features front and duel air bags and it is rear wheel drive.

It has many options such as: stereo options, custom colors, leather interior and they have the model m-5. ( a faster version). IF you are looking for a well built german car, this car has your name on it. It is never going to break down, its safe and very reliable.I reccomend this car to teenagers, buissnessman or women, or families<br><br>
