            This car is unbelievable. You can run it into the ground and it wont die. Mine ran for 300000 miles and is still going strong. Its a neat looking car, although not sporty looking. Its a comfortable car too. we have two and both never need to go to the shop. These should be a highly used car in the U.S with all these gas price highs. This cars runs on about 35 to 40 miles on the gallon. Ours is unbelievable. Really this is a car for you. The interior is very nice and comfortable. The only problem I see in the car is that it doesn't have much room. The seats are comfortable though. If you don't plan on using the back much or have little children this is going to be a good car. Also the engine is loud and the car bumps a lot. I somewhat recommend this car.
