            I own a 1992 4Runner with just over 120,000 miles. These aren't all city miles. Most of them come from adventures all over Northern California, and I'm usually hauling a friend or three and carrying multiple mountain bikes, skis &amp; snowboards or camping gear. Through the snow, on dirt roads, on 4WD roads, across creeks�my truck has taken me to amazing places.  It has never failed me on any of these trips and neither has Toyota or Toyota of Walnut Creek. I say that because the only significant problem I've had with it was the head gasket recall. Fortunately, Toyota of Walnut Creek fixed the problem (twice) without any pain or hassle for me (and Toyota picked up the tab both times.)  My truck has been nothing but reliable (just ask a tow truck driver if he�s ever towed a broken down 4Runner). 

I like how it drives and handles more like a truck than most SUV's  (I've driven friends� Jimmy's, Suburbans, Blazers, and Pathfinders) and I believe the 4Runner is the best of the bunch, especially if you want to drive on rugged terrain.  It is a very tough vehicle and it�s narrow width helps you squeeze through tight spots.  People I know that own GM suv�s always seem to have problems with their electrical systems shortening out as well as brake problems.  Makes me even happier to own a Toyota.

Three of my friends are now happy 4Runner owners. I�m not sure if they got theirs because of my positive experience (and always riding in mine), but it does mean that I don't have to drive as much anymore!

Why wouldn�t I want to drive as much anymore? The answer to this is the biggest negative on the 4Runner (but the reality of owning an SUV).  Gas mileage sucks. It sucks for all SUV�s.  I have a 17 gallon tank and am lucky to get 300 miles out of it.  I average about 250.  Oh well�I consider that the cost of being able to go where I want to go.

I'm not particularly fond of the way the new 4Runners look. To me they look like they have too many bulging plastic looking parts - like a wanna-be Landcruiser. I could get over the looks, but the one thing that I believe is a big mistake is Toyota's decision to NOT include a tailgate option.  My tailgate is a big part of the �utility� in sports utility vehicle.  It�s a good camping or picnic table when none are available; it extends the cargo space for carrying large things or even for lying down and sleeping; it�s a great place to sit and have a cold one after an epic mountain bike ride; and it�s a great workbench for making adjustments/repairs on my snowboard in the ski resort parking lot.

As my truck gets on in years and miles (I hope to get to 200K without problems), I�m not sure I�ll be able to afford (or want to afford) the cost of a new 4Runner, but I�ll certainly be looking around for blue-haired women driving a pre-1996 4Runner.  Chances are it�s never seen dirt or snow and it�s never been driven hard. And, it�s got a tailgate.

Misc. Info:
Why did you buy this vehicle?  My research, especially speaking with mechanics, was that it was that Toyota made the most reliable vehicle I could buy. They were right. I also thought the 4Runner looked great.
Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle: See above
What is it like to drive this vehicle?  Like driving a truck.  I have an V-6 automatic, so I don't have excessive pick-up and I can feel bogged down on hills when I'm carrying a load, but that's why I own a truck. If I wanted accelaration and serious speed up hills, I would have bought a sports car, not a sport utility.
Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't? Should: People who aren't afraid to take their truck through the snow, dirt and mud. That's what this truck was made for. Shouldn't: yuppy posers that just drive around town.  Get a Blazer or station wagon.
