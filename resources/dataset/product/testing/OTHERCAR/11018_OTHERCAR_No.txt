            My Dodge Intrepid was totaled in an accident, so the rental agency gave us a Chevy Astro as a rental. After driving it for only one evening so far, I have found some things I really dislike about the van. First, lack of leg room. I am short and have to sit close to the steering wheel. There is literally no room for my left leg, as there is a large wheel well there. Also the brake pedal is miniscule. Good luck finding it quick when you really need it. The emergency brake is also very awkward. You have to lift your leg nearly to your chin to find it. They should have put it as a hand control, rather than a foot control. The braking is rather stiff. The middle dash controls are tilted towards the driver, so I guess the passenger will really have to crane his or her neck to see the controls. Of course, we'll never know because our van came with a non-functioning front passenger seat belt. I am assuming this van is a 2000 model because there is only 1500 miles on it. I am not a fan of the split rear door either because I can't see anything behind me. I guess I was just spoiled by my Intrepid.<br><br>
