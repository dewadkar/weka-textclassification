            My husband and I knew we were in need of a new, dependable car that was roomy enough for our growing family.  My car was on the verge of &quot;dying&quot; and I was 9 months pregnant with our second child.  My husband had expressed interest in the Montero Sport when he saw one on the freeway one day.  Of course his interest was based only because it &quot;looked good.&quot;  I was hesitant on purchasing a Sports Utility Vehicle because of it's size and rollover risks associated with it, but when we heard of the 00 until 01 event, I knew we couldn't pass the opportunity by.  When we went to the dealer and got to test drive the Montero Sport, we were sold.  It rode smoothly, was roomy and comfortable, and we were able to drive it off the lot!!

Basically, we love the feel of a new car (who doesn't).  It has a large cargo area, it is easy to maneuver through the dash.  Radio is within reach, easy to operate.  What we wish we could change on this vehicle is the miles per gallon.  Also, there are &quot;cracks&quot; that need to be sealed more effectively on the dash. A small space between the CD player and the dash has taken 2 CD's which were only retrievable by returning to the dealer to remove them.  And just below the radio is a little storage space where you can put receipts, credit cards, etc.  The &quot;crack&quot; between the storage space and the dash has claimed my driver's license more than once.

I don't recommend this vehicle for families of more than 4.  It seats four comfortably, but when both you children are still in car seats, the back seat is a tight squeeze if you try to fit three people.

Overall, I am happy that my husband talked me into bringing it home.
