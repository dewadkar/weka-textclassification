            My husband and I purchased a used 1996 Sentra.  We love this little car.  It gets great mileage, and the turning radius is unbelievable.  We both have owned other Nissan cars in the past and this car is of the same calibur.  We bought this car because we had an American made automobile that required more maintenance than we felt was necessary.  The only thing that you might want to consider before purchasing this car, is the amount of space you think you might need for passengers in the backseat.  We have 2 kids, one 8 years old and the other is 18 months old.  Right now, the space in the backseat isn't an issue, however as our 8 yr old gets taller, I forsee it becoming a problem.  This would be a great little car for someone's first car, such as a teenage.  The insurance on this car is relatively low too.<br><br>
