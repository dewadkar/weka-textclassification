            I have heard Gm dealers compare the Malibu to the Camry market &amp; brag that it is approximately $2000 cheaper (Canadian). Well the old saying that you get what you pay for holds true in this case. I do not own a malibu, but drive one everyday because it is a company car. Now.. I don't want you to think that this is only a bad report. The 1999 Malibu is not a bad car, but it is not a Camry. 
At 12000 Miles the brakes &amp; rotors had to be changed. When I brought the car in (under warranty) the service people were very aware of the problem, yet there has been no call back. The problem was pulsating brakes... You know shaking when you come to a stop... The faster you are going the worst it is. I have a friend of mine who is an engineer for GM &amp; he was also aware of the problem. He explained it to me in Engineer's lingo.. bottom line, it is a problem with the car. Other than that, the car has been pretty good. There is 22000 miles on the car right now &amp; a few rattles are starting, but not too bad. Road noise is high too. The reason I wanted to write a review on this car, is because I also own a 1992 Camry. It has over 270,000 miles on it &amp; I have never replaced the rotors &amp; have only replaced the brake pads once. I know this is an older Camry &amp; the new ones may not be the same quality, but I know a lot of friends with a new Camry &amp; there has been nothing but great reports. None of them had to replace the brakes &amp; rotors yet. If you are choosing between a Camry &amp; Malibu.. Pay the extra money &amp; get the Camry.<br><br>
