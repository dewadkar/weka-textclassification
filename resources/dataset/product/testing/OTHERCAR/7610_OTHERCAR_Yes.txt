            What a terrific car.  Great looks.  Get the VTEC model; the lesser kin of the Preldue are really nothing to write home about in terms of power.  Again, let me re-iterate: great looks.

Except for the electro-luminescent-Japan-futuro gauge package.  I tried for months to really like it, but it truly spoils the rest of the car.  Simple traditional analog gauges would have made this car perfect.

Geeze, I really don't have much more to say.  I mean, I know I have to write 100 words, but sometimes less is more.  I think that's the philosophy Honda should have taken here.  They cleared it up well in the newer (97+) body style, but the bug has never left them.  The S2000 is the same way: a dashing exterior, a "love it or hate it" instrument panel.
