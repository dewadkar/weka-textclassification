            I researched every camera I could before buying and this one was the best value that I could find.  Backed up by the Kodak brand its quality and ease of use is obvious at first sight.  I got the DC210 Plus Zoom, and &quot;zoom&quot; is not really the word to use here.  All that the 2x zoom does is provide a different angle view.  Probably the difference between standing 5 feet from something to standing one foot from something.
I have taken over 400 hundred pictures and only had to reset it twice because of some operation error.  I once took 125 pictures in a row for an online catalog and the only problem was a very hot memory card!  I suggest not using the LCD panel or the zoom too much because it eats up a lot of battery life, and battery life you will need because this thing is thirsty!  The biggest complaint about digital cameras is that they do not use the entire battery's life, they only use about two thirds of it, so you are left with a pile of batteries that you can use on remote controls or a walk-man.  I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries!  The annoying thing about changing batteries is that you have to reset the clock and date.
I also highly recommend using a memory card reader because uploading the pictures to your computer using the serial cable takes a very long time.  This is undoubtedly the best camera in this price range for color and picture quality and brightness.  The included flash, close-up shot feature and timer give you a lot of flexibility.  Speaking of quality, I dropped mine from about 5 feet onto a wooden floor and nothing happened to it!
I would shop around, this camera is available for a lot less than the recommended retail price.
This is an excellent starter to intermediate camera!
