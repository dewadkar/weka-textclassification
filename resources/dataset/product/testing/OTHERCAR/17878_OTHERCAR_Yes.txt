            I purchased this vehicle just 3 months ago, and so far &quot;I love it.&quot;  The ZR2 package (a suspension package) raises the Blazer about 3 inches higher than your standard Blazer, and makes the car look &quot;mean&quot; and &quot;beefy&quot;, but the pewter color makes it look &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot;. The front seats are very comfortable when just driving around town or  while on a long road trip. I am a newlywed, therefore there are only 2 of us and this is a fun and comfortable car with lots of room for big packages, small furnishings, and groceries.  I don't think I would recommend this car to anyone that has a family, as there is a back seat, but the back only seats 2 and is rather difficult to get into.  One other downfall of this car with the ZR2 package is the spare tire is hung on the back of the car, making your rear view mirror almost useless, thus you have to rely on the oversized side mirrors (it took me a little while to get used to this, it is similar to driving a van in this respect). I bought this vehicle because I wasn't happy driving a small car anymore, but wasn't ready for a standard 4 door Sports Utility Vehicle.  This is the perfect end result and is a real pleasure to drive.<br><br>
