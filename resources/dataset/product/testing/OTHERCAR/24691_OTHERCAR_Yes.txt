            Although I do not own this van, I work at chevrolet dealership and have had many oppertunities to drive the venture, as well as many other products.  This van is actually fun to drive.  I enjoy driving powerful vehicles, and this van gets up and goes, for a minivan anyways.  
    When winter time comes, you have no need to worry.  Here in North Dakota, the weather gets quite icy and snowy.  I have found this car to get through both excellent.  I have never had trouble starting one of our venture vans in the very cold weather we have had.  The only thing I dont like about the van is if you have automatic sliding doors, the handle is kinda stiff, but that just takes some getting used.  
    For the four years that the venture has been out, it is somewhat hard to tell about their reliability over the years, but rarely do Chevrolet Ventures venture into our service department.  I would definitly recommend this vehicle for anybody with a family or else a large grocery list.  You will not be sacrificing much gas for the roomy interior.
