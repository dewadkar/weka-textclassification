            When my twin sons were born we needed to upgrade from our Mercury Tracer to a car with a little more room. We were very happy with our Tracer so we decided to stick with Mercury. 

We were shown the Mystique and knew immediatly this was the car for us. The babies car seats were extremely easy to maneuver in and out of the back and the trunk had plenty of room for their double wide stroller and bags of accesories. 

Once we got it home we went out for a nice long drive. (To help the kids sleep) and we were extremly impressed with the smooth handling and tight turns. 

After having it for two years we have truly enjoyed the comfort of the seats on long trips and the wonderful gas mileage. 30 miles to the gallon usually.

The only cons I can truly think of is the amount of recalls we have recieved on the car. I believe so far we have recieved six as well as having to have the CD player replaced for malfunctioning and the gas monitor not working correctly which Mercury is working on presently. 

Everything was covered by the warranty so with the exception of a flat tire and oil changes we haven't had to put any money into this car. It is a wonderful family car for families of all ages!
