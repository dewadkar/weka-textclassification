            I bought this vehicle because I needed something that would get me through the winter and not cost an arm and a leg in Gas.  So far it has more than exceeded my expectations.  Gas mileage is on par with the Acura Integra I was driving before, and so far there has not been a snow storm big enough to leave me stuck anywhere, and I do dare to venture out in worse weather than ever before. 

Handling the handling of this SUV is on par with a small car, the ride is smooth enough on bumpy roads, an it handles well in higher speed conditions.

Engine - Powertrain.
Mine is a five speed manual, It has more than enough get up and go in the city but the engine seems to be a little overworked on the highway (there is enough power, but the RPM seems a bit high for cruising at 65-70 MPH.  The AC seems to suck a lot of the power.

Maintenance
In the two years I have had this car, it has been pretty much Dealer recommended maintenance, and nothing else.

Overall Opinion
Very good car for around town driving and occasional highway trip, definitively not a large family car.<br><br>
