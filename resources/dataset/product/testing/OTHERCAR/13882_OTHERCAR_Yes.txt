            I want to say up front, this is a review of a 1987 200SX, not a 86. The two cars are different in the powerplant, in a major way. Since Epinions does not have a slot for the '87 200SX, I put my review here. I hope it will not cause any problems or confusion.


If you've read my first automotive review, you know a little bit about my car preferences.  If not, here's a brief review: 

Boy is oblivious to cars (boy very young at the time) 
Boy sees 1970 240Z 
Boy drools over 1970 240Z (even though boy is only six years old and is prone to drooling anyway) 
As years ago by, boy's fascination with fast cars grows 
Boy obtains 1977 280Z (boy is old enough drive at this time by the way) 
Boy owns and enjoys many fast cars and a few trucks over the years 
Boy buys new truck
Boy loses job 
Boy sells truck 
Boy buys practical, affordable, four-door 1986 Maxima (see boy's first car review) 
Boy regains job 
Boy's sees black 1987 200SX SE-V6 



And now, the review truly begins...... 

You could imagine my surprise when I drove up from work and saw, in my father's driveway, this shiny, black, wedge-shape, V6 empowered, light weight dream machine.  (well, my dream machine anyway) I had driven an automatic version of this particular car a few years before, a customer of my father had bought one and he saw the way I was looking at it, so he told me to take it out for a test drive.  As I was driving it, (trust me, I was driving on my best behavior) I realized that this car had the same kind of thrust most " turbo four " cars have and more, without the turbo lag found in turbo cars.  By the time I returned the car to it's rightful owner, I knew I had found a car that I would love to own in the near future.  So, when I did see the 87 SX SE in the driveway, I made a beeline to my father's garage.  The following conversation commenced: 

Me: " Hey Pop "
Dad: " Hey, Tony.  Did ya get a chance to check out that '87 in the driveway? " He says as he reaches for the keys
Me: " I took a peek at it " I say, trying to hide my excitement  " Is it for sale? "
Dad: " Yep, I found it today. "
Then he said five words I love to hear: 

" Take it for a spin. " 

So much for hiding my excitement.  I think I just about took a few of his fingers with me as I snatched at the keys.  

I hopped into the car, cranked it over, listen to the soft purr of that transplanted 300ZX  V6 engine for a moment, then slipped the dark beast into gear and pressed down on the gas.  The next thing that came out of my mouth isn't fit to print in Epinions; let's just say that I was quite pleased with the result.  After giving it a thorough shakedown, I returned back to the driveway, where my dad was waiting; I am sure he saw the glassy-eyed stare and the slack-jawed expression of my face, so I know he knew what I was gonna ask: 

" How much? " 

I won't get into the negotiating process a.k.a. horse trading me my father get into, lets just say the end result was I had lost my Maxima, but had gained a 200SX.  In the end, it equates to paying around $3,000, which was a very good price at the time.  

I guess I should tell you a bit more about this car.  The V6 SE model of this car was only made in 1987 and 1988, and it only came the hatchback form.  It came with most of the goodies, including air-conditioning, power door locks, power windows, cruise control, and a somewhat decent digital AM/FM cassette player.  Some models came with a pop-up sunroof, while others did not.  Mine did not, which suited me just fine.  The seats were nice and snug, fitting for a sports car, but probably not the best for long trips.  The 87 200SX does have a rear seat, but it's only fitting for small children and not for adults.  In other words, it is a sports car, great for a couple or singles, but not considered a family car.  

Alas, the beauty of this car did not lie in the interior or the niceties.  If any of you have owned the Z cars of the early 70's, you'll understand what I'm talking about.  When you put a high performance six-cylinder engine, coupled to a five-speed transmission and rear wheel drive, then wedge that package into a itty bitty body and frame, it makes for big smiles when you hit the gas.  The 1987/88 200SX SE-V6 is just that sort of car.  Back when they first started making this style, in 1984, the only two options you could buy were the normally aspirated four-cylinder XE and the turbocharged four-cylinder SE. Then, in 1987 The engineers at Nissan, for some reason, got a wild hair and decided to take the engine from the formidable 300ZX and put it into their smaller, lighter SE version of the 200SX.  The result was a brand new SX with the agility and cornering ability of the older Z car, coupled with the power of the newer generation Z.  In fact, since this car was lighter than it's 300ZX brethren , it would run circles around it.  Now, I'm sure you know why I bought this car.  

I was very happy with my 200SX for quite some time, three years in fact, (believe me, that's quite some time for me) however it had a few obvious flaws.  Since it is a rear wheel  drive car, it is no snow vehicle by any means.  Be prepared to put studded snow tires on it if you live in that sort of climate, and even then, be prepared to drive gingerly.  Case in point, soon after I sold my 200SX, the people that bought it, crashed it, had it repaired, and crashed it again, all because they did not respect the power of the car in bad weather.  Also, since it was so low to the ground, it didn't take much snow to hi-center it, which  happened to me once with a very small amount of snow.  And finally, during the dry hot summer days, when you don't have any snow issues, be prepared to watch out for the local law-enforcement, for this car can deceive you into believing you're doing the speed limit when in fact you're not even in the ballpark.  If you don't, in due time, they may start talking to you on a first name basis.  Not a good thing.  

In conclusion, if you want a fast car that may be considered a collector's car in the near future then you might want to take a look at a 1987 or 1988 200SX SE-V6.  As I said before, I had mine for three years and it gave me great service.  Only after it was pelted mercilessly by a bad hailstorm and I was snowbound once too often that I decided to buy another four-wheel-drive pickup......... 

And the reviewing saga continues.........
