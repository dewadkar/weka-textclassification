            July 2001 update -- Windows XP does not support this camera out of the box. Canon support will not provide a beta driver to ensure the camera will even support Windows XP. If you plan to use Windows XP; shop for a different camera.

This is an excellent camera, after using many digital cameras at work, I knew I wanted a camera that felt solid in my hand, was small, and shot about 2 megapixels. 

This camera is exactly that, it is not chintzy like some of the other models available (I remember the epsons seeming very cheap feeling to me) and it is the smallest 2 megapixel camera on the market. I actually wouldn't want it any smaller. I have average sized hands, but I think someone with very large hands may not enjoy using this camera.

I also lowered my ranking about the camera, because the very specific free software is not available on the website. When I was traveling abroad for three months, I was not able to get replacement software. However, Windows ME/2000 can using the built in software to download your pictures in most TWAIN aware applications.

Recent prices of this camera (under $400) are amazing, making this a great camera. I'd suggest purchasing a second battery (I could rarely get more than 30 pictures on one charge), a carrying case, and a 32MB or 64MB at the same time you purchase this camera. The 8MB card just will not hold enough pictures.
