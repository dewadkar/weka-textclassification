            I stumbled upon this camera after much research.  It's hard to understand why this camera is so hard to find; when every pro review site has given it very high marks.  I was considering the Minolta Dimage S404, Canon G2, Canon S40, Olympus D-40, Pentax Optio 430 before I discovered the Casio.  All of these camera's received good reviews, but only the Canon G2 was higher than the Casio.  However, the casio uses the exact same lens as the Canon G2.  The Casio is a great camera.  When you first take it out of the box, you realize that the camera is built very well.  Everything is laid out nicely.  It comes with a neck strap that is very comfortable.  I have used a 2.1 mgpxl camera for the last year and a half.  It was a good camera, but seemed to always be in the camera bag when I wanted to take a picture.  On our last trip to Disneyland, I missed a lot of good shots.  This camera has an excellent lens (all glass) and quality CCD (Sony).  Together they produce great pictures.  I have three children, the youngest is 7 weeks.  I took a close-up of the youngest and printed an 8x10 to see how it would look (using a HP Photosmart P1000).  It was astonishing.  I could not see any pixelation what-so-ever.  Without a magnifying glass, there is no way you could tell it was digital.  With the 4.1 megapixels, you can reduce the size of the files, and still have a very high quality output for e-mailing.  This camera also has a ton of manual options that give you great control of your pictures.  Most of the manual settings are accessed with dial controls, not through the menu.  This is a plus. This camera also uses NiMH batteries.  This is great because you will always have batteries ready to go.  One pro review site rated this camera as one of the best they'd ever seen for battery life.  They said they had no idea how Casio achieved this, but were glad they did.  The memory type is very versatile as well.  You can use Compact Flash type I and II, as well as a Microdrive (up to 1 gig).  You will never run out of memory options here.  The camera also has a very informative LCD, threaded lens, and external flash option.  The camera looks good, feels good, and takes great pictures.  Factor in the relatively low cost, and you have yourself a fun piece of equipment.  I knew when I bought the 2.1 mgpxl camera it would be replaced quickly.  However, I know this camera will be around for a long time.
