            I'm probably about to be roasted here with this review and I expect angry emails and certain reviewers here to rate this as a 'NOT HELPFUL' review but I still have to do this review because I just wasn't impressed enough to have kept this camera after having purchased it.

There are a ton of positives about this camera which is why I said "YES" to $1200.00.  The reviews here on Epinions and more so on CNET are superb!  More so, if you're reading Epinions or CNET, you're already intelligent enough to know a bit about this digital still camera or how to find out about its specifications (WWW.Nikon.Com).  So I won't list them...

I returned my Nikon 5700 for just one reason (maybe two).  There was/is no threaded lens and thus there is ZERO protection for this very expensive camera/lens.  You cannot add ANY filters.  Not even a simple UV filter and that means that at some point you are going to scratch the lens with normal use.  Also, this Nikon has limited lens exchange ability unlike most other Nikon SLR cameras.

What I found with this Nikon was that Nikon took their dismal Nikon 5000 of only a few months in age and hurried to correct many errors in design with that camera and quickly came up with the Nikon 5700.  While a major improvement, this was not a Pro-Consumer digital still camera but a very over-priced consumer level camera.  I cannot believe or accept that the lens itself would offer no protection.

Battery life was quick due to a small battery.  You can add-on a 'battery pack' for another $150 but unlike Sony or Canon, the actual operational battery accepted just the one size battery!  Where were the planners on that issue as well?  Let's offer sub-standard battery performance and forget to protect the critical lens...

Pictures were good.  I used various settings with flash, sun, portrait as well as AUTOMATIC settings and just didn't get the excitement I had hoped for.  The camera was soooooooooooo slow in processing a 3 and 5 megapixel shot (and I used a SanDisk ULTRA 128MB Card).

I still give the Sony DSC 707 kudos for quality and performance let alone user-options (I dislike its bulky lens size).  I love the Canon 20 and even the Sony basic P9's and P7's.  But at $1200.00, I just didn't get much from the Nikon 5700 and so it went back to the store after two weeks of intense use. 

The current issue of Consumer Reports (November 2002) rates all digital cameras and Sony's DSC-707 (now just replaced by Sony's DSC-717)tops the list in overall quality despite its bulky size.  There are no Nikon cameras listed in their top-10 list in the 3-5 megapixel range.
