            I have been planning on a test drive of the VW Passat for a while. The original idea was to check out Audi A4, but then I found out that the Passat uses most of the same hardware, also has excellent crash protection, lots of space and costs less.

<b>The first thing that struck me is the fact that sales people at VW dealerships don't try to convince you to buy a car.</b> I went to two dealerships and in both cases there was no sales pressure whatsoever.

Anyway, there are three styles of Passat (all come in sedan and wagon forms with wagons being about $700 more expensive): 

<b>1. GLS</b>

The GLS has a 1.8-liter turbo four-cylinder engine that develops 170 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque starting at 1950 RPM. 

Standard equipment includes a 5-speed manual transmission, front wheel drive, dual front, side and head airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, traction control, trip computer, 195mm 15� steel wheels, 60/40 folding rear seat, cruise control, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, AM/FM CD player with 8 speakers, power locks, windows and mirrors, remote keyless entry (folding key), security system, engine immobilizer, A/C, cooled lighted glove box and a bunch of other cool stuff.

<b>2. GLS V6</b>

The same as GLS, but with 190 hp 2.8-liter V6 and real wood interior.

<b>3. GLX </b>

Same as above (V6, wood trim) plus auto climate control, rain-sensing and speed-sensitive windshield wipers, bigger wheels (205 mm 16� alloy) plus all options available on GLS. It also has power seats, power folding mirrors, several memory settings for seats, automatic dimming interior mirror, passenger-side mirror that tilts down automatically when the car is put in reverse.

<b>4Motion</b>

Passats can also be had with 4-wheeld drive (4Motion) with V6 auto transmission only. Same hardware as Audi A4 is used.

<b>Options</b>

GLS has several option packages available. The cold weather package features heated seats, mirrors and windshield washer nozzles. The leather package � leather seats, leatherette door trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel with cruise control and audio controls and cold weather package.

The luxury package replaces steel wheels with alloys of the same size (with anti-thieft locks), adds power glass moon roof with sunshade, manual rear sunshade. You can also get a premium Monsoon sound system and/or a Homelink remote control.

The 5-speed Tiptronic transmission is another option, available on all trim levels.

<b>Test Drive</b>

I wanted to test drive the turbo model with manual transmission, since paying almost $3K extra for V6 with not much more thrust and with more weight, and wood trim seems a waste of money. The 1.8T also gets remarkable fuel economy with manual transmission � 24 MRG city / 31 MPG highway.

Unfortunately, the dealer I went to had only one car with manual � a loaded GLX. So I test drove both GLX manual and GLS 1.8T Tiptronic.

<b>GLX Manual</b>

First thing I noticed is the fact that the clutch pickup point in the car I drove was high in the pedal travel, which takes some getting used to. 

The instrumentation is violet-blue lighted (which makes it extremely difficult to see) and the tachometer and speedometer are too far apart with tach being on the left and being marked with in hundreds (10-20-30...) instead of more conventional thousands (1-2-3...). 

<i>In other words, the instrument cluster is designed to look good (and it does), but not for functionality.</i>

The shifter has short handle but somewhat long travel, which is OK by me. The shifting is easy and you always know what gear the car is in (the Nissan Altima I drove was worse in this respect).

The acceleration is very good (my Mitsubishi Galant feels slow by comparison) as well as braking. The V6 engine is torquey and pulls very well form low RPMs. It is also less noisy than the 4-cylinder I drove later. Although the ride is not sporty, it is very well controlled and tuned for comfort.

There is enough space in the cabin and it looks very nice with leather and wood. The instrument cluster looks nice with chromed rings around instruments and the trip computer display in the middle. But the nice-looking instrumentation is not as legible (violet-blue illumination) as simple white and red combination of my Galant.

The climate control is very effective and the cabin looks very good with wood inserts and leather.

<b>GLS Tiptronic</b>

The Tiptronic 5-speed automatic allows you shift the gears yourself by sliding the lever to the right and pushing it up for upshift and down for downshift. The current gear is shown in the display below the trip computer information. Maybe somebody will like this functionality, but it felt weird and I felt that it is better to just leave the thing alone and make it decide what to do.

The problem (aside from torque converter eating some power) is the fact that you have to calculate how many times to downshift, whereas the manual can instantly be shifted into the gear of your choice. Say, when I approach the turn, I want to shift into the second gear. With manual, I just shift, well, into the second gear. With Tiptronic, I have to calculate how many times I have to push the lever down.

I am sure that it is just a matter if getting used to. And had the car had buttons on the steering wheel, I might have appreciated the convenience more. But I like manual transmissions...

The 1.8T engine makes good power, but a bit more noise than the V6. Acceleration is also very good and I expect the acceleration with manual would be even better. The chassis feel very solid and the noise insulation is great.

The interior looks less luxurious than in V6 models because of lack of the wood trim, but it still looks nice.

<b>Interior In General</b>

The Passat recently received �real� cupholders between the shifter and the armrest between the front seats. The pedals are well spaced and the glove compartment is cooled by the A/C, which is a good thing if you decide to take a bottle of water or a can of soda with you. 

The interior volume, according to the VW�s brochure, is 95 cu. ft. and is quite enough for the family of 4. The front seats can be moved so far back that I couldn�t reach the pedals (I am 5�11�). The trunk, although has a relatively small opening, is spacious and the rear seats can be folded either fully or separately (60% or 40%).

The car has remote fuel door release (in the driver�s door), so you can feel more secure. I, for one, don�t feel secure with the fuel door of my Galant having no locking mechanism of any kind, so anyone can put whatever he/she wants in there.

<b>Exterior</b>

The Passat is head and shoulders above its Japanese competition in the styling department. The styling is very close to Audi and for 2001 � model year were slightly improved by addition of chrome stripes and other niceties. Although I am not sure that they couldn�t have done better with the tail lamps, the car overall looks great.

The VW also claims to have improved the rigidity 10% comparing to the old model and the laser welding is more frequently used (from the VW brochure). The standard steel wheels with covers look OK, but the optional alloys (GLS) or standard alloys or GLX look great.

The only issue I see with the tires is their width. It would be better if customers had an option to have 205 mm tires on the GLS, or, better yet, have an option to choose a sport package. But that would bring the Passat into Audi territory and VW doesn�t want to compete with its own subsidiary.

<b>Pricing</b>

The prices you can get the Passat for are much closer to dealer�s invoice price than MSRP. CarsDirect�s prices are (destination charges included):

GLS: $21,157
GLS with leather package and luxury package: $23,851
GLS V6: $23,416
GLS V6 with leather package and luxury package: $26,110
GLX: $27,481

For Tiptronic 5-speed auto, add $1,073
To get the wagon version, add about $750

<b>Bottom Line</b>

<I>The Passat is somewhere in between the mainstream Japanese family sedans and German entry-luxury cars from Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. It is definitely a good value, taking into account its feature content, flexibility with options and Audi-sourced components.

I like Passat�s looks, solid structure, its handling, value, fuel economy (1.8T manual), ability to have manual transmission and an option to be able to get a wagon version of any style.</I>
