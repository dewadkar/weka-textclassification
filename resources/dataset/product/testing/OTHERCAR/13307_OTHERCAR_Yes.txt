            Don't get me wrong, I love this car. i just have apparently a common problem. 
You see, we bought this car off of a used lot and did not purchase that expensive warranty that they apply to your loan to make more money off you. We decided against that and less than 1 year later we  had a car with a blown engine all because Dodge makes these cars so that the oil light does not come on until it's way to late. If you own a Dodge of any model check your oil often.
 The other problem comes from blowing the engine up. The engine in this car is a test engine. It was the first year that Dodge was putting hemi engines back into cars. Because of that, these engines cost an arm and a leg to replace. They are hard to find and expensive to boot. If you have to have internal parts for repairs call around before going to get it. Some of these parts are going to be hard to get unless you order them from the dealership. I am sure that it will get easier to find parts in the years to come but be for-warned that if you are going to buy this car either get the warranty or get something else.<br><br>
