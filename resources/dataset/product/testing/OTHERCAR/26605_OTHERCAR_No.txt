               In the year 1988 I purchased one of the best American luxury sedans. That is what I thought. But I was wrong. It was a Chrysler New Yorker. Please no one should buy any kind of Chrysler cars including this one. They should stop making Chrysler because Chrysler is a car that falls apart all the time. The only good things about this car are the special functions.

   Some of the special functions in this car were the leather seats, automatic windows, locks and seats, automatic transmission and mirrors, lots of storage compartments, digital compass, with two storage compartments on the top etc..... Here are all the problems I have had with this car:

1. The mirror on the glass fell off many times.
2. Changed the brakes many times.
3. The stereo cassette player broke.
4. When you turn on the a.c. the car stops running.
5. The engine will stop working after 30,000 miles.
6. The battery will also stop working after 30,000 miles.
7. The fan belt kept on going even though the car was stopped.

   This car broke down many times while I was driving, and this car also wasted a lot of my money. So don't buy a Chrysler New Yorker. It's a bad car. In fact I would suggest don't buy any kind of Chrysler cars. Other wise you will waste a lot of your money in putting repairs into Chrysler cars. Don't buy any kind of cars that the Chrysler corporation makes. They stopped making Chrysler New Yorkers in 1996. That's good. So in the summer of 1999 I sold my Chrysler New Yorker to a ford dealer and bought a much better and safer car the 1999 Ford Crown Victoria. I'm glad I sold my Chrysler New Yorker. Finally after 11 long years I got rid of my big headache. I wouldn't recommend this car to no one.<br><br>
