               When i say that the Honda Civic is the best value in the new car market, i mean it.  The Honda Civic 's combination of inexpensive price tag, great durability, economical fuel mileage, and solid repair history back up that claim.  For the money, you can not buy a more valuable and servicable vehicle.  

   Sure you can buy a bigger, faster, or more powerful car, but the Civic is pretty zippy itself, more than holding its own for the commuting and road trips that i subject my Honda Civic to.  In a time of uncertain situation in the oil controlling middle east, the Civic's fuel economy is especially important.  

   Also, over the past decade or more, the Civic is among the most reliable, long lasting cars out there, along with such models as the Accord and Toyota Camry.  

   My recommendation- if you do not have a large budget for a new or used car, consider a Civic.<br><br>
