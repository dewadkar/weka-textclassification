            When I decided that I was in the market for a digital camera, I wasn�t sure exactly what I wanted.  Digital Cameras are not cheap, so I wanted to do as much research as possible ahead of time.  I talked to friends and family, searched product information pages on the web, and of course � EPINIONS regarding digital cameras. I also had to decide how I was going to use the camera.  So I jotted down a few notes, with �Must Haves� and �Nice to Haves�.

MUST HAVES:
Price � Not to exceed $600
Megapixels � at least 2.0
Picture storage � flashcard (at least 20MB)
Connection to computer � USB
Connects to Windows PC
Good reviews from people who actually own the camera.

NICE TO HAVES:
Connects to Macintosh 
Ease of use.
Photo software.
LED screen.
3x optical zoom

Of course, different people will have needs, but these addressed my needs.  After I decide what I was looking for, I searched the web.  The closest I came up with was the Kodak DC280, which satisfied all �must haves�, and all my �nice to haves� except the 3x optical zoom (it has a 2x true optical, and 3x digital zoom).

Once I got my camera, I was very pleased on how easy it was to use.  It really has the look and feel of a nice standard 35mm camera. It took me 10 minutes to set up, 15 minutes to load the software on my PC, and I was ready to go.  The USB port is great � VERY FAST! It is supposed to be 10x faster than a serial port, and I believe it.  If you have a USB port on your computer, I would highly recommend getting a camera that can utilize it.

Another surprise was that I was expecting a 20MB flash card, but received a 32MB card instead.

The JPEG pictures look great on my computer screen. My brother has a DC210+, which is a 1 Megapixel camera.  The DC280�s pictures seem much clearer, especially the background items. So I think getting a 2 Megapixel camera is really worth the extra cost. 

It is very cool to snap a picture of my kids, upload to my computer, and email it to my family 3,000 miles away within 5 minutes.  Technology at it�s finest!

The one potential downside (so far) is the rubberized plugs on the side of the camera.  I am sure that they will fatigue and fall off in time.  A small quibble.

I have only had my camera for a couple of days, but I�m thrilled so far.  I highly recommend the Kodak DC280.
