            We bought our 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara in August 2002. We do like the Suzuki, yet as time progressed we realized we need a larger SUV. The Grand Vitara is good for city driving, the commute to work or such; not very good for long trips or a large family. The backseat is very cramped to have adults or teenagers in it. 
We have had problems while moving and shifting into 4 wheel drive. It seems to stick and we have to keep messing with it- therefore it is not recommended to shift while on the go. The sound system is average. One thing is the gas mileage is great. This is a very reliable mini SUV. We have had no problems at all as far as mechanical. As soon as we purchased this we did tint the windows, have diamond gloss applied, installed a alarm and remote starter for the extra luxuries. 
For a final note: If you are uncomfortable driving a very large SUV (we recently bought an Expedition for our "large" SUV, and I use the Suzuki as a second car around town) then this is the perfect SUV for you. This is not a family SUV, you will grow out of very quickly. If it is a couple or single person traveling then yes I would recommend it, otherwise opt for something a little larger.
