            I needed a digital camera, but didn't want to spend a fortune.  For $299.00 the Olympus D-340R filled the bill.

It's used for family photos: the grandchildren, special events and the like. Plus I use the camera to photograph items sold on Ebay and other on line sites.  The manual covers all questions, it shoots great close ups of small items and takes the normal shots with ease.  An electrical plug in unit saves battery use when using the camera in the home.

Software is provided to download the photos onto a computer.  It's been used with a power mac and Dell windows 98 machine with a Flash Path device that fits in the floppy disc file.

It's my first experience with a digital camera and couldn't be happier with the system.

The only note:  using the camera's rear photo window and flash wears the 4 AA batteries down rapidly when shooting large numbers of photos.  Carry extra batteries, indoors use the AC adapter.<br><br>
