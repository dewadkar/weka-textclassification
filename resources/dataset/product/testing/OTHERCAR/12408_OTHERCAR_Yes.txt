            I really want to avoid car buying for the next 10 years, if possible. So this time I researched and got the things I've wanted but never had in a car before:  moonroof, good stereo, keyless remote entry/alarm, blue.  I looked at other subarus and the fords.  My best friend already owned this car for a year and loves it.

I traded-in an outback sport which i had been unhappy with.  My issue is that I want the rear seats to truly split 40/60. In other words, someone can sit in the rear seat while things are laid down next to them on the lowered split.  Also, I wanted to be able to have plenty of leg room in the front seats when the rear seats were down - two things the outback sport didn't do.

This car is very roomy compared to my last.  I needed a wagon because I haul stuff around for my biz. This has ample room for me now.

I got the Turbo 1.8. My ex, the Audi nut, wanted me to get the V6 with all wheel drive.  Sorry, my budget couldn't take it.  I did lose AWD that was standard in my subaru. So far I haven't noticed the loss in the passat. Besides, I live in Sacramento - no snow and little rain.  I think I'll be just fine.  I haven't noticed any problems with power and I'm a zippy driver.  I'm anxious to try it up the hills but feel ok since this has the Tiptronic system so I can switch to "manual" driving if I want.

I'm sad that the alloy wheels are so soft.  I scraped a storm drain and it put a nasty gash in my wheel!

I love the fact that I now have both CD and cassette.  The Monsoon sound is great for me - not being one of those thumping, high decibel boom boxes cruising down the road.  

Safety wise, I like the fact that I have the side and front airbags, anti-lock brakes, and sensitive braking.  It also has the daytime running lights and the turning signals on the side of the car as well.  The adjustable height seatbelts are nice because I am petite and have been bad about wearing belts in the past because I don't like the way they cut across me.

The only negatives I see so far are the storage areas in the front seat area.  There are door pockets, the glove box (which interestingly has it's own AC vent for storing temp sensitive items), a little cubby to the left of the steering wheel, a document stash area under the steering wheel, and the between seat console.   The glove box is limited (as all are).  It's nice to be able to put the car manuals under the steering wheel.  The side cubby is awkwardly placed and does not have a little door.  The between seat console is very small - would only hold 4 CDs.
There are 2 cupholders between the seats in front of the console. The console is not convenient for arm rest.
