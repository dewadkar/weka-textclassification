            I purchased my 2001 Rav4 on March 16. The first problem I ran into was the fact that I had to wait 3 weeks to get the car. The dealer did not have any 4WD models in stock. If you plan on buying one get the 4WD model, it's way better and it holds it's value better than the 2WD. The fact that they are so wanted by people, made it very hard to bargain with the dealer. My final price was 21,900 including the Quick Order Package (A/C, power doors,locks, keyless entry, AM/FM stereo with Tape and CD indash ). I also got mats alloy wheels, roof rack and LOJAK. I have the 5 speed manual 4WD in black. So far i have a good experience with it except for a minor rattle from the dashboard. I have checked on Rav4world.com and almost every owner has complained about it. A trip to the dealer fixed it in about 20 min. Other than that the is performing flawlessly. Handling is good and comfortable and there is plenty of room for 5 adults. Because of it's high demand, do not count on the dealer being too nice. "If you don't like it , someone else will!".  That is the attitude you will get from dealers. Anyhow, look past it and buy the car, you will enjoy it! By the way it is the only 2001 model which has NO RECALLS.
