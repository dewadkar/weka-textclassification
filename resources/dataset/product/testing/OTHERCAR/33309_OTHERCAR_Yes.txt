            I hate SUVs.  They use too much gas, are often bought more as status symbols, are dangerous to other drivers, and most people who buy them have no need for all or 4-wheel drive.  BUT, after moving to a remote area that gets a lot of snow, I needed to get something that would get me around in the snow.  I considered an all-wheel drive car, but those I could afford were too small.  We have two kids, so we also needed something with a lot of cargo space for road trips.  I considered the Toyota Rav-4, and Honda CRV, but after driving all three, I found the Forrester the most car-like and it had more room than the equivalent Toyota and Honda in the same price range.  Also, the Subaru had significantly more horsepower at the time.  Anyway, after considerable searching, I found a 1998 S model (the one with all the bells and whistles) with less than 60K miles on it and a 5 speed.  The vehicle has excellent acceleration, and plenty of room for luggage.  I bought a roof top storage thingy, and it has plenty of room for 2 adults, 2 kids and all their stuff.  Handling is very car-like as it's based on an Impreza chassis rather than a truck frame, other than sitting up a little higher, it's pretty much like driving a car.  We average about 28 MPG, which isn't too shabby with regular driving.  We've had no mechanical problems, no leaks, and other than a few minor rattles when you go over a bump, it's a very solid vehicle.  The S model has standard heated seats, heated rear view mirrors, power everything, anti-lock brakes, and nicer tires and alloy rims.  My primary complaint would be the size of the rear seat.  It's fine for kids, but not very comfortable for adults on long trips.  As an added bonus, I don't feel guilty about having an SUV as it gets decent mileage, isn't too large, and the all-wheel drive comes in very handy as we live in the woods.  The new RAV-4 and CRV may be better, but if you want a used, reliable small SUV, the Forrester is a good choice.
