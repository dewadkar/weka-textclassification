            My dad bought a new Dodge Shadow ES in 93. The 93 Shadow that he bought has the 3.o V6 Mitsubishi engine, the same engine that Dodge put in the base Stealth. He also got the all disc abs brake system, which is the same as the brakes on the Stealth, and the 15&quot; aluminum rims with low profile, high performance tires. The car has the five speed transmission. In the past seven years that my dad has had the car there have been no major problems with the car. The engine is very responsive and the car has very good handling. The abs system is one of the best brake systems, with discs at all four corners the has incredible stopping power that does not compromise the handling of the car. The car is very fun to drive with the five speed and v6. The shifting is very smooth. with the power that the engine has it is easy to pass at any speed. The interior of the car is very comfortable with everything in easy reach. Even though the car is now seven years old the finish is still in very good shape. If you are able to find one of these Shadows with the v6 it is a very good car and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a fun car to drive at a reasonable price.<br><br>
