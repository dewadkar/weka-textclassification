            I love my Camry!  I have a 1993 Camry, bought new.  The only thing I have had to replace in 6 years besides tires (which I seem to go through like kleenex) and a battery, was the cigarette lighter.  Just recently, coming up on 7 years, I have had to have the mast in the antenna replaced, but other than that, this is one fine car.  It is well made, and if I had to buy another car right now, I would definitely buy a Camry, although I do not like the styling on last year's model as much as my version.  I have driven and ridden in several other models of cars and this, by far, is the most comfortable.<br><br>
