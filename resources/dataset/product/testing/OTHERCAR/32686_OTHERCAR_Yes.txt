            I was in the market for a good used vehicle(1994's -1998's). My wife and I researched the WEB for best prices for luxury cars.  Determined, we test drove almost every make and model, foreign and domestic in one day!!!! To our amazement, we discovered that the Lincoln Town Car beat all other brands in several categories: Ride - the quietest, Comfort - the leather seats adjust to any position, Gas Mileage - 23 in the city and 28 on the highway with a V8 4.6 liter engine, Price below wholesale !!!! Reliability - rated number one for luxury cars. Listen, I dare you to drive a Cadillac, then a Lincoln Town Car.  We settled on a 1998 Lincoln Town car and I would highly recommend that anyone in the market for a good luxury car GO TEST DRIVE A LINCOLN TOWN CAR.<br><br>
