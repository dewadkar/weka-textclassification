            I purchased my Diamante with 69,000 miles on it and felt it was a good buy for $8,000.00.  However, I have had some problems with it.  The brakes are a major problem!  Rotors &quot;always&quot; warp after 2-3 months of driving (I drive 50+ miles a day).  The main ABS unit had to be replaced eventually and the crank pulley went out one morning.  My speedometer went out when I hit 90,000 miles, in addition to the cap and rotor, main computer and idle controller.  What money I saved when I purchased, I have pretty much had to put back into the repairs of the car.  Fortunately, I had purchased an extended warranty and this pretty much took care of all my expenses ($3000 +).  However, despite all of the repairs, the car is a delight to drive.  Handling is superb, gas mileage is great.  If you are looking for speed, this car has got it!  I mean, take it off overdrive and you are pretty much flying - - use the Anti Traffic button (power mode) and you are flying in style (uses much more gas of course).  The interior is great - the most comfortable car to drive, especially long distances.  I really enjoy driving this car!  The quality is definitely there - very solid.  The interior is luxurious and the sound system is awesome!  I think my car was a &quot;flood&quot; car and this is perhaps why I have had so many problems with it.  I would like to buy a newer one just to see if it would go the distance without visiting my mechanic too often.  <br><br>
