            Toda I went car shopping yet again and elected to visit the Local honda dealership. Todays venture left me examining a 2001 Honda Civic Si. 

Outside - The newest generation Civic has a very nice profile, resembling a high power sports car and looking like more of a sports cars they economy wise coupe. It has sharp angles and lovely lines and are appealing to the eyes. Honda has shortened the front end quite signifigantly. Overall it is a sharp car with its own unique design. Kinda looks like Fords New-edge styling.
I give the Civic SI a 8/10 For exterior design.

Inside - Stepping into the cabin, there were many luxurious items to note. For example the model I drove today had 2 lights on the roof, one fore and the other aft for rear passengers, decent cupholders and a very simplistic instument panel, making it an easy vehicle to drive. Honda has done away with complex switches and levers making this car safer in the sense that the driver doesnt need to remove thier eyes from the road because they cant locate the right button or switch. Instuments are large and night time viewing is easy on the eyes. As well, a small metal-like panel around the automatic shiftgate helps it to look more luxurious. Driver seating is assisted by an armrest that is bolted into the side of the seat. Passengers do not get an armrest or even share an armrest. Both seats are thinly padded, but supportive. The coupes rear-entry is assisted only on the passenger side, as it rolls forward. Rear seats are like most coupes, a bit tight and firm.
The stereo is as good as can be expected but seems to have more trebel then bass. Coupes also get red backlighting at night for thier instruments. Trunk space is on par with most rivals.
For its simplicity, I give the civic a 5/10 for its interior.

The Drive - The drive as a whole was uninspiring. Working with 2 demo Civic SI's I had the option of testing a NON-VTEC engine and a VTEC Engine. Both were 1.7. The Non-vtec claimed to have 107 horsepower and the Vtec claiming to have a whopping 160 horsepower. Driving the 1.7 non vtec engine with an automatic was pleasurable. Its engine was noisy as expected with all 4-cylenders and droned with highway cruising. Its shifts were smooth, but the car lacks any passing power. The 5 speed VTEC engine was next up for grabs. It responded with a bit more response then the Non-vtec, asoundedly I realised the Vtec produces 106hp up until 5400rpm. The maximum 'normal comuting' requires. Afterwords, the vtec springs to life and provides the power until 7000rpm and its power drops off. after doing the math, in order to get the power and using 1 tank of fuel I was getting around 25mpg in comparison to a 39mpg range when it wasnt used. The manual was surprisingy nice with small shifts, smaller shifts however can lead to incorrect shifting to the inexpereinced. The drive was nice however and the car responded well in handling and in emergency braking. Previous model Civics had better handling. But this generation of Civic has better road manners, bumps rarely shaking the cabin. 
For the VTEC let down and basic power I gave the civic a 3/10 for its engines.
For its transmissions, I give an 7/10.
For ride comfort, I give a 6/10.
For fuel economy i give a 9/10.

Overall the VTEC is advertised to be better then what it is and most buyers will never use it. It may be feasable to purchase a model one step down and save by not buying a Vtec engine.
