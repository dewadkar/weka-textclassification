            I bought the 1995 LS Integra sedan new. After 84,000 highway miles, this car can only be described as a GEM of first class proportions! I highly recommend the 5 speed, as you gain power, control, mileage, and the FUN to drive factor.

First, I have not had ONE SINGLE THING ever go wrong with the car. It has driven flawlessly from day one, without a single non routine maintenance repair. Other than routine oil changes, and service, I have had NO shop visit. I have done routine maintenance and had one set of front disc pads replaced. To this day, it rides, accelerates, handles, and behaves precisely as well as it did when I drove it off the dealer's lot.

The LS is a great performer and great fun to drive. Don't believe what you read about how the Integra GSR outperforms the LS. In everyday driving, and even quite challenging driving you won't tell the difference. The fact is, when you overlay the torque/power/acceleration curves for the 140 HP LS vs. the 170 HP GSR, they are virtually identical until you get well above 5500 RPM's. That's really where the VTEC advantages of the GSR kick in.  Now if you are out racing at 100 MPH + on a routine basis, then the several 6 or 7 thousand $$$$ more for the GSR will be justified. In everyday routine driving however, even HARD and FAST driving, (which is what I do), there simply is no substantive difference.

I love the handling on this gem, and commute a winding, demanding road, 80 miles daily. I simply never get tired of the &quot;fun&quot; factor that an otherwise torturous drive, produces from this car. 

Comfort is also a big plus with excellent fit and finish, well laid out dash, strong air conditioner, comfy seats, and excellent visibility.  

Mileage for all this power and fun? Unbeatable! I consistently get 28 to 34 MPG on 89 octane with this screamer, and I drive it pretty hard. 

Complaints? None of substance. My only nits to pick would be that interior road noise is slightly higher than more &quot;sedate&quot; sedans provide, wind noise around door seals is a bit higher than for most sedans, and the stock premium stereo could be better for those into audiophile quality sounds systems. Beyond those rather minor &quot;sound&quot; related caveats, I have simply never owned a car I loved more than this one. And probably never will again, if they redesign the fun out of this, as so many other manufacturers have done.
