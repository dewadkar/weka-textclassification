            I purchased a program Bravada in 1994 with 15,000 miles on it. It has leather interior  and was very nice.  I now have 143,000 miles on it. It has been a real gem. The only problem I have experienced with it is the fuel pump went out twice. This happened in a 3 month period, so I'm thinking that possibly the dealership didn't really change it out the first. time. I have driven through a lot of nasty weather and had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed recently that the paint is beginning to chip off below the back door latch and on the left front fender. This vehicle is a joy to drive. It is tall enough that a short person can see really well, but not too tall to get in easily. I would definitely buy another one.<br><br>
