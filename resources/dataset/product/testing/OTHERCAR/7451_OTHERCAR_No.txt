            My husband and I purchased a Grand Am LE in 1991, new.  It was an automatic, with cruise, tilt, AM/FM radio, A/C, and PS.  The first 2 years, the car seemed to do pretty good.  The only problem then would be the car would overheat when idling.  We took this back to the dealer, but they found no problems.  It got very good gas mileage, 28 in town and 34 highway.

Two years after we bought this car, there was a recall on the paint job.  We took this to the body shop and they painted it very poorly.  We were without a car for a week due to this. 

At 69,000 miles, the ignition module went bad.  We paid almost $500 for an $85 part to be replaced.  This was due to the location of the part, not easy to get to.  A month later, the radiator fan stopped working.  This caused the car to overheat on the Interstate with no place to pull over.  Repaired that problem with a $110 part, but luckily my husband could fix that.

The car has had 4 alternators on it, starting when the car only had 35,000 miles.  The dealer could not find any problems, but definitely there was a problem.

At 90,000 miles, the oil pump assembly went bad causing the timing chain to break.  This cost $600 to repair and again it was working for only a short time.  At 106,000 miles, had to replace the timing chain again due to manufacturer defect in parts.  This cost us an additional $300 to replace.  

There was one good point, the A/C would freeze you out on a hot day.  We never had any problems out of the A/C unit.  The body of the car was put together well, for looks anyway.  It would squeak and rattle on the dash and all the other plastic parts. 

I would recommend a 2.5L Tech4 engine as a boat anchor anyday of the week.  The final draw was when the computer went bad at 112,000 miles.  One day it was running, the next it wasn't.  This is when we decided to drag it to the dealer and trade it for a Ford.<br><br>
