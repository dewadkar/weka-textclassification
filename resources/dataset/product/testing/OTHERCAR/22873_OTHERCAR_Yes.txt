            In 1995 I bought my Shadow from a local dealer.  It was &quot;new&quot; then...a surplus model really, but it was new to me.  Red (of course), 2 door, 2.2 liter, 5 speed, no options, no grace...and certainly no manners.  But, it was all mine.

5 years later, and having survived career changes, a failed relationship or two, several moves, using it as a camper, a racecar, and a hotel, my old Shadow had been through it ALL.  160,000 miles on it when I traded her in.  In that time, I replaced the clutch, the struts, windshield, the ENGINE, a radiator, and a camshaft.  All of these repairs had nothing to do with the quality of the vehicle.  The car had a hard life, because I honestly beat the car pretty badly.  And it lasted....

On the road, it felt like a truck.  You sat up pretty high for a car, and since it was a base model, no creature comforts were to be found.  The interior was the standard fare GREY, with few color accents, if any.  The car was front heavy, and if you pushed her too hard, she would do her best to REALLY SCARE you back.  Under-steer would be a good place to start...as the front end would try to coast off of a highway ramp.

At 92 horsepower, the engine was peppy for a 5 speed, lame with the automatic.  Many people have complained LOUDLY about the 2.2 4 cylinder, but the original engine lasted 151,000 miles before the third cylinder lost compression and dropped out altogether...and even then I drove it for three weeks on 3 cylinders.  On the highway, my trusty car gave me about 38 MPG in overdrive, and in the city I got just under 29.  Not bad for a 2700 pound car with little grace.

I miss my old Shadow.  I traded it in on my new Kia, which I pray is as good to me as my old Dodge was.  In the time I had it, it left me stranded only THREE times: 1)dead battery 2)Cam broke on expressway-109,000 miles  3)Head gasket let go as a result of my love of performance exhausts.  I hope whomever bought my car realizes how great that car is...and will be for another 160,000 miles.<br><br>
