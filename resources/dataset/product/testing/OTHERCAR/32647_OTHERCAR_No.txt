            I had the worst trouble with this piece of junk. It was my first car and I was only 16, but I had to have a sport utility. I was a dumb kid so I chose the most affordable SUV on the lot. It ran good for about 3 months, and it all went downhill from there. The only good thing I can say about this car is its a 4x4 and has plenty of room. Other than that it is a lemon, at least mine was. First of all the oil started to spill right out of the oil cap, this was new to me. Secondly I had to replace the alternator, and Transmission. So far so bad, I was 16 and working at a job that paid about $7 an hour. All I needed was a repair bill to stack on top of my car payment. 

Another thing was it took me at least 15 to 20 min to get it started in the winter. This vehicle had a very high center of gravity and was real prone to tipping over. I saw a report done by consumer affairs soon after I bought the vehicle which stated that the cherokee was one of the most dangerous vehicles on the road, great what else could go wrong. I owned this car for 3 years and had problems the entire time. I had this vehicle in the shop at least 5 times each year. In the end I could not even trade it in on another used car. I simply let the bank repo it.<br><br>
