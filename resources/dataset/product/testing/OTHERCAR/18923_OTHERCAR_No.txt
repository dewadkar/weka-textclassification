            I bought my 93 Tracker in early 1999. The main reasons I bought it was the nice look and the appeal of sitting higher (compare to a car). 

I bought the 2 wheels drive. Since I never go offroad I thought the 4wd was not worth the price difference. HUGE MISTAKE. Well this may be the case if you live in an area where it never snow, living in Canada my experience is totally different. The driving wheels are the rear ones wich I think is even worse. When the road gets snowy or icy you never know what will happen when you take a curve (even at low speed). The rear end just keep sliding, and sometime it even gets frightening. 
With that car you get to hate winter even more... 

Otherwise on dry road condition it is a fine vehicule. Not much comfort but it will take you where you want to go. The "anti-aerodynamic" shape can be annoying in long trip because of the extreme sensitivity to lateral wind, not mentioning the total absence of sound proofing. It is almost impossible to have a conversation with the heavy wind noise. 

Mecanically speaking no major complaints. The engine is noisy but during the 2 winters I had my tracker it always started no matter how cold it was outside. 

Well I'm selling my tracker and I'm not sad.
