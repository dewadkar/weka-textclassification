            I bought a used 1996 Toyota RAV4 this week and have already decided it is one of the most fun to drive vehicles I have ever owned. I got the two-door, 2WD model which has the shortest wheelbase and tightest turning radius of any of the RAV's. The suspension is stiff without being harsh and gives a firm feeling of being in control of the vehicle. The two liter engine is slightly underpowered. It does get decent gas mileage, though, which offsets the lack of power somewhat.

The only real complaint comes from my kids, who don't like the lack of legroom in the back seats. Since I bought it mainly to drive to work, I'm not overly concerned about that. The sound system is decent, the A/C cools nicely and the slight road noise is not overly objectionable.

I love the handling and the way the vehicle responds once the engine is up in the power band where it develops enough power to scoot along nicely. I've had no trouble merging onto the freeway or stopping quickly when someone ahead of me stood on their brakes. Overall, I like it!

Buying it used, I didn't get all the maintenance records, which is something I would normally insist on. Since it was owned by a retiree and had extremely low mileage, I wasn't overly concerned.

If you are considering one, look at three factors: 1. If you have kids, you might consider the four door version. 2. If you are not in a hurry, consider the 2001 models since they are supposed to have the option of a six-cylinder engine with more power. 3. If you aren't planning offroad adventures, look at the 2WD versions which get better gas mileage since they don't have the extra weight and mechanical drag of the 4WD versions.

Having owned Toyota vehicles before, I expect many fun years of driving.<br><br>
