            I love my Chevy Tahoe, and so does my husband love it. We leased it in 1997 as a new vehicle, and it has 50,000 miles on it now. We have taken it on several long trips and it is very comfortable and smooth, and dependable. I feel safe in this vehicle also, I might add. It is roomy , yet not too large to handle. I call it a truck, because it is more of a truck size than a car, and it is higher off the ground, which I like a lot.
It is a pleasure to drive this vehicle. 
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who has children. It is ideal for a family of 4-5. There is plenty of room for groceries, luggage or pets in the back along with kids or passengers in the seats.
