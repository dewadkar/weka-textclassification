            &quot;Aaron,&quot; my dad says in his yellish fashion, &quot;Saturn just sent me a postcard on their new LS sedans that offers 1.9% financing!&quot;  Working for my dad meant he held the purse strings and if there was any way I was going to get a new car he would have to be excited.  He had always liked saturns but I thought they looked lame and had no go.  I only went because it might provide me the opportunity to take him to see some Accords.  You see, he owed me the money but i still had to squeeze it out of him.  As soon as I saw the LS-2 I was very interested... and skeptical.  Then I noticed the wood, the roominess, and the CHROME. (I love chrome)  Soon after driving it I gave him the keys to my 92 maxima and went home in my studly white LS.  It wasn't a BMW M-3 but it was nice.  The engine is spectacular once you get accustomed to the way the pedal controls the engine.  At first I tended to go too slow or rev it too high.  The very same day some friends and I were hanging out and we decided to take a road trip in the new ride to Vegas!  It ran so smooth.  It was then I realized how powerful and clean the audio system was.  I love the way they have a front/back mirrored setup with a woofer and tweeter in each door.  This way the sound is equal for every passenger unlike the rear deck lid 6x9's that are 4 inches away from the back passenger's ears.  I am an audio engineer and I find no fault with this system.  I could use a bigger gas tank.  13 gallons is pretty weak.  Also the Air is worthless when you have it on 4 in the AZ.  Also at idle it looses its cool.  My maxima was black but it was a freezer.  I have taken the LS back to the dealership but they found it to be working properly.  The only other thing is that the remote only works from about three feet and in.  I might as well just use the key.  Still, I love it and it is so origional that everyone wants to know if it is a 2001 Toyota Avalon ($32-$37,000)<br><br>
