            This is a very good car to drive. This car handles well in all situations. Steering is responsive. It's quite, smooth riding, has good pick up off the line and passing. Front and back seat passengers have enough room so that they are not squeezed together like sardines. Back seats could be a little more comfortable though. This car would be very good on a long trip. Every body would arrive refreshed. Wind noise is minimal. Road (highway, secondary, and city) noise is largely not noticeable.(dirt roads and gravel are another matter.) This car is a joy to drive. I especially like the &quot;OTIS&quot; (Onboard Trip Information System). The seats are comfortable, especially the multi-adjusting and heated seats for the driver. <br><br>
