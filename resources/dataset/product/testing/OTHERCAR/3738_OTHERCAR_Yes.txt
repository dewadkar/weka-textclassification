            I've always been a really big Pickup Truck fan.  In my opinion, they are so useful, and I would never be without one.  However, with a growing family, the pickup truck I already owned just wasn't fitting the bill any longer.  It was time to do some shopping for a new Pickup.  

After looking around at a few dealerships, getting some quotes online, we decided to buy a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado, with the extended cab. I've always liked Chevrolet products.  Chevrolet is all I've owned, and I have always been happy with Chevrolet.  

From the moment we sat in the truck, I was hooked!  I never expected a pickup truck to have so much room inside the cab.  Sure, there is enough room in the bed of the truck to haul anything, why would anybody need room inside the cab?  Having two children, I do!  Anyone with children will probably understand the need for extra room in the vehicle you choose to drive.  I really like the amount of legroom in the front and back seats.  The seats are also very comfortable.  The seats have lumbar support in them.  At first I wasn't very impressed with this feature, but after a long ride on a recent vacation, I found myself thanking GM that they put them in the truck!

Another one of my favorite features on the truck is the radio.  When you turn off the ignition, the radio will stay on until you open your door to get out of the truck.

Also, the truck rides so nice and smooth, that you really don't truly believe you are driving a Pickup Truck.  The last truck I owned nearly shook my teeth out, the ride was so rough, so this was a welcome change.  

Overall, this Silverado is a great truck, especially for a growing family, or if you just need some extra room, but do not want to have to give up driving a pickup truck!<br><br>
