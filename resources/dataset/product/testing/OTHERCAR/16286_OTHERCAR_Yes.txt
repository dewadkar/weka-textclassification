            I got this Hewlett Packard Photo Smart C200 for christmas and was very excited.  I had wanted a digital camera for some time and this was the best gift of all.  I have taken literally hundreds of pictures and all of them have had <b>excellent</b> quality.  

<b>Brief Info</b>

The HP C200 Photo Smart digital camera is 1 mega pixel that comes with a digital view screen and a built in memory disk.  Unlike other digital cameras, there is no card for you to take out and insert in your computer.  The transferring process occurs by plugging in a cord from your camera to your pc.  I have heard there is something you can buy for this camera to do it by disk, but I hear it is a bit pricey.  If you are going to spend more money you misewell dish out the extra dough to get a digital camera that </i>comes</i> with the transferable disk.  

<b>Great Benefits</b>

Some of the things you will really notice about the HP is that it takes <B>excellent</b> pictures.  The quality is so clear and crisp you will be glad that you got this camera.  Since this is the only digital camera that I have owned, I can't compare it to anything else but I have gotten many comments on the quality of picture it takes.  

If you want to delete the pictures you took, simply turn on the camera and press delete "all or one".  You can take pictures over and over again and never have to buy film... that's saving money!

There is an easy access menu to delete, edit and zoom & preview and lock your pictures.  Something else that is great about this camera is there is the ability to hook up your pictures to your TV.  It's really awesome checking out your personal pictures on your television screen!

<b>Some Drawbacks</b>

There are a few drawbacks to this camera such as the delay in the picture taking.  When you hit the grey button, it's supposed to lock the picture.  Then you are supposed to hit it again to actually take the picture.  It's sort of annoying especially when you want to take a picture really fast.  Another thing, it eats batteries.  Since it doesn't come with a charger, you're left to just keep feeding it those duracells.  I have seen one for sale at Best Buy for about 40 bucks, that might be cheaper to invest in for the long run.  I still haven't bought one but one day I plan to spend that hard earned cash because I think it will save time and money.  Another drawback is the slow transfers.  Since you rely on batteries for this camera, it remains on throughout the transfer to your pc.  You waste a lot of time transferring the pictures and meanwhile it eats those batteries right up.  

<b>Ending Thought</b>

Even though I listed some annoying drawbacks, I still think this camera is worth the money you pay for it.  I believe that my mom paid about $250 but I can't be totally sure of that because it was a gift.  There are a lot more expensive cameras out there that probably take the same quality of picture.  If you really want a digital camera but don't have $1000 dollars to drop on one, I totally suggest the HP C200 Photo Smart.  I have been happy with it!
