            I am leasing a 96 Dodge Neon. It gets good gas mileage (about 30 miles to gallon) but it does have its problems. 

This is definitely not a cold weather car, things freeze on it that you wouldn't expect. For instance, The turn signal froze and had to be repaired and the door locks freeze very easily (even in temps where you can't see your breath). 

There is a recall out for the 96 Dodge Neon that causes engine stalling but Dodge says that my vehicle was made a few weeks after the recall date (even though it stalls because of the same problem). The steering wheel gets jittery at speeds around 65 and the vehicle is noted (and I have heard them) to make a clunk sound when making a sharp turn at low speeds and the brakes squeak at at low speeds as well.

I am definitely not buying a Neon again.
