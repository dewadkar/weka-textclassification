            We purchased our 1991 Plymouth Grand Voyager at the end of the model year and got a great deal on it!  It has a cloth interior which has held up very well.  Since we bought it in the manner that we did, we had no choice of colors.  My husband intended to buy a deep red model but the white, woody was such a good deal that he could not pass it up.  

I was driving a station wagon which I absolutely hated!  I told my husband when he brought it home for me to look at that I did not like it or want it.  He bought it anyway.  It was luxurious but I was never comfortable.  The best thing about that car was that they gave us a very nice price on it in trade.  

The minivan got about 16.5 mpg, more when on the road.  At the time we bought it, our older daughter was playing select soccer on a team out of our area.  It required a 30-45 minute drive (some highway) to get her to two practices and 1-2 games a week!  The minivan was very comfortable.  When you drive that far for practice, you spend a lot of time in the car!  I felt like I lived in the car during soccer season.  My younger daughter was a toddler and she was dragged along to her sister's soccer stuff.  She also spent plenty of time in the minivan, waiting.  (Small wonder that she did not want to play soccer when she was old enough -- she dances!)  I found the minivan to be quite comfortable.

We had several occasions to take trips in the minivan.  My daughter played several tournaments out of town, including Washington, DC.  The longer Grand Voyager has extra storage space behind the seat.  We filled that!  The kids liked for us to remove the middle seat so that they could sleep on the floor while driving!

The day finally came when my husband was ready to buy something new.  We had an old motorhome that he wanted to replace and he wanted a custom van.  His sister jumped at the chance to own our minivan!  The minivan is still going strong!  It has well over a 100,000 miles on it.  The interior still looks good too.  My sister-in-law says there is a whole lot of life left in the old car!  Of course there have been some small repairs but nothing huge has happened. 

I would say that since our old minivan has served two families well, it has been a good value.  Anyone interested in a minivan cannot go wrong with the Plymouth Voyager! <br><br>
