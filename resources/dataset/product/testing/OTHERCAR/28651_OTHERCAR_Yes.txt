            I received my Kodak DC200 as a gift after many months of toiling over the decision and I am extremely pleased someone else helped make the decision for me. Great pictures and ease of use are the best ways to describe this product. My expectations of quality were blown away. Whether I was indoors or out they came out as clear as when I used a traditional film based camera. The software was easy to install and interacting with it was a breeze once you got everything working together properly. My only suggestions for improvements would be more &quot;easy to use&quot; set up instructions. The documentation could have provided a little more detail to get me kicked off for the first time. Transferring photos from the camera to my PC through the serial port were really slow but I expect it would be like that with all digital cameras as long as you use the serial port. One recommendation is to get a separate piece of hardware that hooks into the PCMCIA slot to transfer picture much faster. If you don't have a lot of money and are looking for a great first digital camera, this is it!<br><br>
