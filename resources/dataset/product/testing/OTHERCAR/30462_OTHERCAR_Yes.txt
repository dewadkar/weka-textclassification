            I am very new to the Toyota Corolla, we recently purchased a few weeks ago, so if you are looking for an opinion with a lot of experience behind it, this isn't the one.  But I can tell you that I love this car!

We (my wife and I) have been shopping for cars for the past few months.  We had looked at a Honda Civic, Saturn's, and a Subaru.  I had totally dismissed the Toyota Corolla as competition to the cars I was looking at.  But a few weeks ago, I saw a Toyota on my way home from work, and then it popped into my head that this wouldn't be a bad car.  So I asked my wife if we could  go test drive it.  She agreed and we went to the dealership.  We first did test drive the Corolla CE, the mid line with a 5-speed transmission.  To be honest, I felt it was in the same category as the Honda Civic, but no better and was prepared to go home.  But I looked at the LE, and it has a lot of features that I was looking for in a car.  But I just though that the price would be too high.  But looking more closely in the price, I was pleased to see that it wasn't that much more in price but a lot more in value.  So I test drove the LE and was very happy.  It felt very solid, and the engine purred.  I liked it so much that I ended up buying it!

There are many other reasons I bought this car other than it was fun to drive.  I know that Toyota's are dependable cars, and the car we bought will hopefully be with us for many years to come, and I have no reason to doubt that.  I also know that the resale value is very good.  So when I do decide to trade it in, I should get a good amount for it.  

This is a good car for just about anybody.  It goes easy on the gas, has a decent amount of room, and is fun to drive.  For us personally, we just became a family so this is the perfect car for that.


I will keep you informed if my opinion suddenly changes, but I don't see that happening.  After driving it for a few weeks, it has been very much a pleasure!

<b>Update July 5, 2000</b>

After buying our Nissan Sentra for $5000 less than we did for this car, my enthusiasm, while still high for this car has lessened.  We have taken it in to the shop a couple times for &quot;factory defects.&quot;  One of those times, the check engine light was on, and they had determined that to be a bad charcoal filter, and they replaced it.  The second time was because the light for the license plate was broken and needed to be replaced.  I feel these are minor and a small amount of these defects is to be expected.  The only other complaint I have now is that I don't have nearly as much headroom in the Corolla as I do the Sentra.

Overall, an excellent car, although for the price, I would look at other possible options.
