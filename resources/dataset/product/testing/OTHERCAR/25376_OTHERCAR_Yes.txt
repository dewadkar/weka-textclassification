            I received this digital camera as a gift for Christmas a year or two ago. I was excited at first because I had wanted a digital camera. After receiving the camera, I played around with it. I took a # of pictures and it began to shut itself off when I pressed the button to take a picture. After replacing the batteries with new ones, it would work for a few weeks (maximum) Then the problem occurred once again. The quality of pictures is great. THERE IS ONE BIG PROBLEM with this particular camera!!
After a short period of use, the camera will automatically turn off after pressing the button to take the picture.
We had the manufacturer send us another one and replaced many batteries. Still it shuts itself down! What a pain!!<br><br>
