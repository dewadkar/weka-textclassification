            I have owned my 2001 Alero for about 6 months now.  I love it. It's a wonderfully smooth ride compared to the Mustang that I previously owned.  I love all the bells and whistles that came with it too.  And the 75,000 mile/5 year warranty gives me comfort that my car will be working for years to come!

I got a silver Alero, with the sight and sound package.  The stereo has had problems - but that's the only problem I've had with the car.  When I run the AC - condensation is forming on my CDs inside the CD player.  The CD player will quit working also when this happens. I have an appointment next week to get this looked at.

I love the sunroof.  I love the way it monitors oil quality and the air pressure in the tires.  I love how it tells me when the wiper fluid is low - before it all runs out.  I like the 7 second delay when I hit the lock button and get out of the car - if I forget my keys I have 7 seconds to open the door and grab them!

It has keyless entry with a trunk button to open the trunk and a panic button for safety.  The trunk is very roomy, and mine came with a cargo net to help keep stuff from being tossed around.

The drive is smooth.  It handles great on snow and ice.  The traction system is fabulous.  I hit one patch of ice and it turned on instantly last winter and I was able to maintain control of my car beautifully.

The seats inside are very comfortable.  The back seat has room.  I'm only 5'2, so I think it's great.  My brother is 6'4, he says it's a lot roomier than a mustang.  He wouldn't mind riding back there for short trips around town.

The headboard seems kind of low to me.  I feel like my head is going to bump the ceiling - and I don't like having my garage door opener on the drivers side, but there's no where to place it on the passenger side except way over on the visor by the passenger window, and that's too far to reach.  

My car insurance has dropped in price since I've purchased it, which is a savings as well. 

Overall I'm very pleased with my Alero.  I plan on driving it for the next 5-6 years hopefully.
