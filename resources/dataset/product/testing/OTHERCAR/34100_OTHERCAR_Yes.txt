            Wow, this car is great.  It is luxurious and comfortable.  That's everything my parents were looking for when they were buying a car.  When they bought it I took it for a little ride and I loved it.  It handled great and I could barely feel the bumps.  Although, I do prefer my mustang better, because it has more speed and smaller.  I don't really like driving big cars that much, but when the occasion calls for it I will.  Anyway, back to the Lincoln.  My parents fell in love with it ever since they got it.  My mom said that she won't drive any other kind of car except a Lincoln.  They haven't had any major problems with it, only minor.  It was mainly things like the muffler.  You know the usual stuff.  <br><br>
