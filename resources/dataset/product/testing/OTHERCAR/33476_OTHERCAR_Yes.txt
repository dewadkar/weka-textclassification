            I bought a 1991 Cavalier RS, when I was 17 years old.  It was my first car, and still is my car to this day.  I just love it.  I had to have some work done to it a few months back, and I was just lost with out it.  I bought this car because my mom had a Cavalier, and hers was dependable.  I wanted a car that was as good as hers.  I also bought it because it was sporty, and ran well.

What I love about this car is that it is me.  It tells every one what kind of person I am.  I hope when people see me they say there goes Kami, and her sweet little car.

To drive this car is a dream.  It rides smoothly, and handles great.  I have never had a problem with the car in the handling department.  It has always been smooth sailing for me!

I recently purchased and newer 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier, and to be honest I wish it ran as good and my 1991 does.  I have held on to the 1991 because I am going to fix it up, but find myself wanting to drive it more than the newer 2000-read my epinion on the 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier.  The 1991 has more engine power and drives better than the 2000.  It even gets better gas mileage than the 2000.  If I had known all this I would have used the money that I used as a downpayment and used it to fix up the 1991 Cavalier.  It would have been worth it!
