            After getting a surprise mini-windfall, I decided that I wanted to try out a digital camera. However, having had experience with poor indoor picture quality with my mother's flashless digital camera, I went in search of an inexpensive digital camera with a flash, just to see whether spending more on a better quality camera would be a wise investment.

I found the Agfa ePhoto Smile for 84 dollars, which was the least expensive digital camera with flash available, and bought it. I was not expecting a high picture quality- it is, after all, a digital camera under 100 dollars. Surprisingly, it did take fairly reasonable pictures. Yes, they are somewhat pixellated, and taking detailed photographs really isn't possible, but they're of a reasonable quality for the price. I've also found that resizing the default 640X480 output images by half sharpens them up considerably.

The ePhoto Smile only holds 16 pictures, and is not at all expandable- completely expected for a camera in its range. I read the specs before I bought it, so I wasn't surprised when I actually got the camera. It does run down the batteries extremely quickly- which is true for any battery to computer peripheral. I did have some problem with the included uploading software- the software wouldn't initially retrieve the photos from the camera. However, a quick trip to the AGFA website provided a downloadable software patch which fixed this problem instantly. Their website was easy to navigate, intuitive, and their download servers were very quick.

The camera itself is lightweight, durable, and attractive. The flash works extremely well, and has four options- off, automatic, red eye fill, and on. There is no display, so using it is much like using a standard camera- point through the view finder, click, and see your photos later. There's also a ten second timer included, all very nice features for such an inexpensive camera.

All in all, the Agfa ePhoto Smile is not going to take award winning photos, but it is a very nice introduction to digital photography. Based on my experience with this Agfa product, I did later purchase an Agfa ePhoto 780, and I'm very glad I did. I find them to be a superior company and a superior product, very reasonably priced. My six year old son now enjoys playing with the ePhoto Smile, and I feel it was a very worthy test investment. <br><br>
