            I was going to purchase an Infiniti I30.. went to a local dealership in the northern suburbs of Chicago.  And was treated with disrespect and pretty much the overall feeling/vibe of the place was of sheer boredom.

What a pity for them, because I left the lot, swung a corner and saw an Acura dealership which I went into.  Immediately, everything at the Acura dealership was positive, professional and different from what I have ever experienced at any other dealership.  I am fairly young, at the age of 22.. but I have owned and purchased six cars since the age of fifteen and the Acura CL is my seventh.  So believe me, I have had my fair share of experiences from Volkswagen, Nissan, &amp; Audi dealerships.

Acura blew them all away.  Well, after some two hours, I walked away with a beautiful 1999 black/black leather Acura 2.3 CL.<br><br>
