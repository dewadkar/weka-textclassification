            I've wanted a Jetta since I was 16.  Eight years and a college education later, I bought one.  Couldn't be happier.

Ok, so maybe it's a yuppie car.  And it WILL haul a Billy bookcase from Ikea, no problem.  The fact is, I LOVE THIS CAR.  I don't consider myself a yuppie. Here ends my defense...

I must acknowledge the change in design.  I've always been attracted to the boxiness of VW vehicles, so it took me a while to decide about the new rounder versions...  I've decided it works well.  A perfectly calculated approach to modern style.  

Good things about the Jetta -- HUGE trunk.  Huge.  I list this first to follow the IKEA comment.  (Anyone read that review with a title that seems to have nothing to do with a VW Jetta?  It's interesting.  About a girlfriend and life after college or something?  I enjoyed it.)  The inside of the car is quite spacious, and the backseat has sufficient, if not ample, legroom.  Visibility is great.  Parallel parking and weaving in and out of beltway traffic are a breeze.  Keyless entry is convenient.  I drive a manual transmission, and it picks up well for being a four cylinder.  The response is much better than I expected.  The engine hums most pleasantly, and I notice no rattles.  With regular gas it gets almost 400 miles to a full tank.  The factory stereo surprised me with its quality.  Seats are comfortable even after a four hour trip.

Not so great things include the fact that three people in the backseat seemed to be too much for the cool little spring-loaded compartment between the front seats.  That's one thing that will be fixed when the next complimentary oil change comes around.  It takes a while for the car to heat up in 20-degree weather -- my old '88 Jeep pickup warmed up more quickly. But it defrosts very rapidly.  Due to its popularity, I had a difficult time finding a car on the east coast with the options I wanted. Didn't get silver, which was the first choice -- but the midnight blue is beautifully reflective at dusk.  There are lots of Jettas buzzing around here in Northern VA (however, back home in Western PA, I only saw one other), which did not appeal to me at first.  However, I enjoy the car so much now that when I see one on the road I am happy for the driver!

Okay, okay, facts aside -- I love this car.  It is sharp looking, super fun to drive, and gets great gas mileage.  What more could you want?  It is a great value.  Every morning I smile to see it sitting in the driveway.<br><br>
