            I had heard of this camera but unfortunately had not read any reviews before buying it.  After finding a great coupon and seeing that the camera did come with a rebate I decided to give it a try.

From the time it came out of the package the problems started.  The batteries (included) were dead, no software and no cord that attaches to computer.  I sent the camera back and got another with all the equipment needed.

After installing the software (not as easy as the packaging says) my daughter took some pictures and we uploaded them.  The quality of the pictures were extremely poor.  Outdoor pictures of the dog, trees, etc. were so blurred that we would not have know what the pictures were of if we had not taken them ourselves.

The only redeeming factor is the print software, "Winnie the Pooh".  The software allows you to make invitations, thank-you notes, cards, etc. and is very cute.  

If you're buying a camera for a 6-7 year old for a toy, (and that's what this is) this would be fine.  If you're buying it for a camera, find something else.
