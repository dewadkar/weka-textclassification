            The camera takes great pictures overall but takes the best pictures while outdoors. The camera can be set to automatic setting or manual setting so as to be able to tweak all of the settings of the camera. In manual you can tweak most settings like exposure, white balance. The camera comes with a 8 mb secure digital card but should be replaced with a 64 mb card or higher if you want to take many photos or use the full photo setting. For most people the 64mb SD card and using the medium setting should be fine. Most time I use medium size pictures because they take up less space and I dont care to print large  pictures. The camera can take up to a 256 mb card. Full picture size is 2048x1536, Half is 1024x768 and small is 640x480. One of the cons of the camera is that it uses AA batteries instead of rechargeable batteries. I recommend using a rechargeable 1800 mAh NiMH AA batteries because they last longer than regular alkaline batteries. One more con of the camera is if you want to use a tripod and you have to change the batteries or change the SD card it is hard because both are on the bottom of the camera. The camera comes with a remote and also has a timer you can set from 2 to ten seconds. Some of the camera's features include: (on the dial) setup mode, pc mode, playback mode, auto photography mode, manual mode and movie mode. Many of these contain sub menus to control other features. It is hard to name all the features of the camera but it includes many more and has a very good manual to describe the many features. The camera also uses ACD software to extract the images from the camera. Personally the software is ok but to edit the pictures I would use Adobe or other.
