            Don't expect to climb mountains with this vehicle. But do expect a smooth comfortable ride and good handling under normal driving conditions.
 Like all SUV's the Jeep Grand Cherokee is not meant to go 4-wheeling off cliffs or cross rivers or traverse a line of fallen trees. Despite what you may see on TV commercials or on road test magazine TV shows this and all SUV's are not meant for off-roading. It's an alternative to the station wagon, which has become passe. It's great for grocery shopping, carting the kids to soccer practice, loading it up with friends to go out on the town, and is very good for driving in light snow. If you try to do any heavy duty off-roading you will probably end up breaking an axle or rolling over. Heavy snow is also a hinderance but it is so for any SUV. Once you get to the point that the roads are frozen over all the 4x4 and chains in the world won't keep you on the road. 
 In town the Cherokee drives very quiet and responsively. Acceleration is smooth and braking is quick. Freeway I could ask for a little more oomph entering but I think that is due to the fact that I've been driving a V8 mustang for so long. Gas mileage is great in both. It's astronomically better after driving that gas guzzling mustang. 
 For the price this is the best SUV out there. It has nice amenities such as a CD player and power everything. And the neat little computer in the fron center of the roof is handy. It displays the direction you're driving and has countless other functions. Cargo space is more than enough. I can fit almost everything I own in the rear cargo bay and back seat. The Cherokee is also not unnecessarily fancy like so many other SUV's on the market. Compared to a Navigator or Mercedes SUV the Cherokee is much cheaper and drives just as good. It just lacks a few bells and whistles that you're paying about $10,000 more for. 
 I can't say I hate anything about the Cherokee except maybe that it's not heavy-duty enough. But that's not what it's designed for. If you want to do serious off-roading, forget the SUV's and go buy an early 70's Blazer or Bronco and fix it up. It'll be cheaper and much stronger. <br><br>
