            Before you buy your next car, read this.  Consider if you want to buy the newest fun fling that will last a mere two years or a good, reliable car. Certain cars fall under both these categories.  If you have been driving lately, you will see the latest craze is a VW.  VW's are and have been for many years, very dependable cars.  And now they have been more upscale than the old VW Beetle.  I dare you take a test drive and you, too, will fall in love.

It is a fun car to drive, and takes off like a sports car.  Lightweight, but with a heavy feel gives the driver a sense of stability and security.  Even the base model has great amenitites, and the radio system is great.  The reception is great even in Malibu, a place where we can only get San Diego Hispanic stations, if we're lucky.  This car also gets great gas mileage.  It can basically run on empty for a long time.
Moreover, VW certifies all their cars, old and used, coupled with great service, so that you only pay a small 25 or 50 dollar deductible.  The only con is that the brakes have a tendency to squeak lightly, but that is normal and hardly noticeable.  

I bought mine used (3 yrs), and it runs and still looks like new.  People still don't believe me when I tell them how old my car is!  I couldn't ask for a better car.  Just try it yourself and see.  Any skeptics will think otherwise with a little test drive.
