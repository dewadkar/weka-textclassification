            I had driven my 1986 Volvo 240 DL into the ground.  I needed something affordable and just as dependable.  A lady in my church told me that she was selling her 1991 Corolla for a measly $800!!!  That afternoon I drove to her house and test drove a great little car.  I bought it that day (something I don't usually do).<br>The car had 154,000 miles on it and handled like it was new.  Ice cold air flowed from the vents on that hot July afternoon (a luxury my Volvo no longer allowed).  The factory AM/FM cassette stereo delivered quality sound.  The engine proved more than efficient on that country highway.<br><br>I have owned the car for fourteen months now and have 171,000 miles on it.  It runs as good as it did the day I bought it!  The only service I have done to the car is regular oil changes and replaced a small pipe in the exhaust ($25.00).<br><br>The car is not perfect.  It could use a paint job and has a little rust along the bottom (dirt roads take their toll).  Neither of which affect the performance, only the value.  Other than that I have been completely satisfied with this car up until recently.  It's just not big enough for a family.  With a new baby on the way and relatives coming to visit, our car is limited on passenger space.  It's time for me to buy a minivan.<br><br>However, if you are looking for a car with great gas mileage, outstanding reliability, little to no service, and moderate comfort, the Corolla is for you!  I know I plan on buying another one in the future.<br><br><br>
