            I had almost convinced my husband to buy a SUV-(Pathfinder)- I love the looks and drive- we also needed the extra room- But I knew that he really would prefer a truck- when I saw the 4 door Frontier I had to take a look inside- At first I can say I was a bit turned off by the short bed- It looks  odd- compared to the length of the truck- but when we took it for a test drive it was a winner from the start- it rides as  comfy as the many SUVs that we test drove, the shifting is smooth most of the time, but can be a bit grindy when warming up..THe 4x4 is a bit hard to get into at times...BUT ....I love the look of the truck inside and out.The interior is plush, We haul around 3 teenage boys  in the back with no problems ( 2 fits best)- THe truck is great because it fits the need like an SUV would allowing extra space like we needed but allowing for the messy garden, fishing poles,bikes, garbage etc.. we sometimes haul in the back without getting an interior messy.The bed is plenty large enough for us.I wouldnt say its got the most peppy of engines- compared to my Honda Si- but I can merge onto the freeway quick enough to keep up with the best of them.THe air conditioning is great, The seats are wonderful  on long rides- arm rest are in the perfect positions, knobs are easy to reach, the cup holders are plentiful, Gas mileage is OK- not great - we mainly drive in the city.The only thing in the year that we have had  problems with is that it sometimes has a hard time shifting into first gear smoothly when the engine is not warmed up- and the drivers side mirror vibrates when driving. We intend on keeping the truck forever.<br><br>
