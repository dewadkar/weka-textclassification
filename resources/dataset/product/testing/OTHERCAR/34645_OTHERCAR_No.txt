            I was pleased with our 1998 Pontiac Montana until it spontaneously ignited and burned up in my driveway one night. It had not been driven for over 36 hours when it went up in flames just like the western image shown in Pontiac's Montana TV commercial. Sifting through the debris and ashes left in our drive, the state fire marshal traced the fire to the computer control area. Pontiac claims no responsibility.
Our family of six liked this van for its internal child seats, automatic sliding door and extra passenger door. The extended cargo area came in handy for lugging groceries or camping gear.
But we've had our problems: the headlamps collected water and had to be replaced; and the electric door stopped working at one point.
The worst, of course, was when it went up in flames! It certainly seems odd that a car would explode into flames like the Pontiac did. We were shocked when we heard the horn blowing at 9:30 p.m. and looked out to see the van engulfed in flames. By the time the fire department arrived, it was a total loss. Thank God there were no passengers in it when this happened nor that it was parked in our garage. In either of those cases we would be in the burn unit or our house would be in ashes as well.
A warning to all Montana owners: be aware that your Montana might ignite just as ours did.  Although Pontiac wrote us that they had no responsibility in what they termed our &quot;alleged thermal event,&quot; I am hesitant to buy, rent or lease a GM/Pontiac product or recommend such use to others. In my opinion, this is a potentially life-threatening situation.<br><br>
