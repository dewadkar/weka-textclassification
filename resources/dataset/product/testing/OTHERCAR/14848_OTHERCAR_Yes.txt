            When I moved to Iowa in 1992 and experienced their snow storms I knew my luxury car that did not have front wheel drive would not work.  I investigated SUV's and determined if I had to give up the car I did not want to give up comfort, safety, and the extras.  After a lot of research I decided the Bravada was the only acceptable vehicle. The day I took it for a test drive it was snowing, so I really got a chance to give it a real test.  I must add that I had not driven in the snow in over 15 years, and this was the first vehicle with anti-locking breaks.  The vehicle had all the comforts and was very attractive but the mechanicals were my main concern.  My husband and I both gave it a work out and decided that this was a great vehicle.
Since the vehicle had to get me to work daily and to night school 4 nights a week I was the decision maker and determined I could easily make the transition from luxury car to the Bravada.  My first experience with the anti locking brakes was a shock, but I found out they work and this was very important for the road conditions in a state where there is snow all winter.  The leather interior even today looks fantastic. Sitting higher up gave me the ability to see further to be a more defensive driver and that is very important to me. I navigated Iowa snows for 4 winters before moving to Northern Georgia. This vehicle has over 120,000 miles on it and has been one of the best vehicles I have owned, I refuse to call it a truck because it does not look or act like one.  We have driven this all over the U.S. and have never had any trouble with it except a new water pump, regular maintenance and a new battery.  I would love to buy a new model but this one is still in tip top condition so my husband refuses, he now drives it since he travels so much.  I think this is a great family vehicle, and good for empty nesters too. There is room to carry all those needed things from the home improvement center, and every home owner knows a car just cannot handle everything.
Oh we probably need to have a motor replaced for the passenger side window, it is getting slow but that's not bad after owning it for 7 years. The tires have been replaced and it is a great riding vehicle, although the newer models are more aerodynamic.  This vehicle is great for families who travel, need room and like style and comfort.  The new models are more refined and have a smoother ride, the additional brake light and other safety improvements.  
I do hate one thing about the Bravada and that is I have no CD player in it. Do not buy this vehicle if you are really short, you will need to stand on something to wash the roof. Also you do not get as good on gas mileage as you would driving a car, but then I feel safer in a bigger vehicle. Also one needs to know that no vehicle is safe in the ice and owning a SUV does not mean you can ignore road conditions.  As with any vehicle you must drive slower in bad weather and take corners at a reduced speed.  You should take corners at a slower speed than when driving a car because a SUV is
 higher off the ground and different.
