            I bought this camera 2 years ago, before getting the Kodak DC 265. Originally, it was meant as my utilitarian camera...the one I would HANG OUT with. Even though I have purchased more expensive cameras, and would probably always shoot through an SLR 35 mm if I had the time and the money, I have found this to be the camera I always go back to in the end. I have found this to be especially useful in portrait photography, when the goal is ease of operation, the shortest time between shoot and product, and the relative expense of producing an image.  

Let me explain. I am a painter by nature, and &quot;people&quot; are my subjects of choice. I like the moments that are unexpected: the gestures that make us human. This camera allows me access to spontaneity, unencumbered by a 200 foot extension cord or an expensive memory card. In addition, as a gift for the image I capture, I can give the disc to the participants for their own use.  I began (again)taking newborn pictures about 2 years ago. The most expressive are in the first hour after birth. I then took the disc to my office, printed a few for parents, or loaded another disc.  The battery is good for a couple of hours, and the camera monitors this as you shoot.  If you don't like the pictures, erase the disc and start over!  I have loaned this camera for weekends for people to try before buying their own. In fact, it is on loan now.  I should be earning a commission for Sony, since I have sold at least 10 of these for them in the past two years.

A word on the prints:  These will only be as good as your photo software and your printer. I had a friend who didn't care for his finished product. (Of course he was just a regular guy, not &quot;A ARTIST&quot; like me). His main problem though was printing with a substandard printer. Be sure to print with a printer that offers &quot;photo resolution&quot;. My HP has been going strong for 4 years, and has a little more stored memory than the standard ink jet.  If you are interested, I will be glad to tout the glories of this camera anytime.  Also give my address to Sony. I could use the money...about time to buy another one! 

If I had my &quot;druthers&quot; I would buy a camera with all these features, and higher resolution too. I suggest, however, that you practice taking pictures with this one first! If you are a mediocre photographer, a more expensive camera won't help. Invest in some solid edition software. It helps, no matter which digital gets your money.<br><br>
