            I bought my Corolla (base model) a year and a half ago and it is one of the best buys I've ever had. If you want a dependable, comfortable, economical and cute compact car that will get you there every time, this is the car to buy.  I've never had a moment of worry or needed to do a single repair since I've owned the car.  Basic maintenance keeps it running well, and running, and running, and running, and running.  I'm confident it will keep on running for as long (or longer) than I need and want it to.
Especially for a moderately priced car, the interior is comfortable and stylish, not to mention roomy.
The car is responsive, the steering is tight and the brakes always grab without hesitation.  Acceleration's not bad at all, either.  
In short, if you're looking for a car to get you to work every day (and out of town on the weekends), if you want it to last forever, require almost no maintenance and never need repairs, and if you want economy with your style and comfort, get a Corolla.
