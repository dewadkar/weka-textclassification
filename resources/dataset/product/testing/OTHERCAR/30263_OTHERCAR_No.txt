             I bought this little blue camera for 85 hard earned dollars and was extremely displeased. The darn thing didn't work. This little camera, which has a resolution of 640x480 max, broke when I put the cord into it to upload my pictures. This camera is only for people who have a lot of patience, which is not me. Agfa probably has one of the worst technical services in the world. I called them up and asked for help, after waiting on the telephone for 30 minutes they finally helped me. The person claimed that the camera couldn't be fixed and all that dog poop(please excuse my language except it is the truth). The software for this camera is great, however, that is if you can get the camera to work. This camera does have a flash which is nice. It is one of the cheapest cameras on the market, however don't buy it. If I were you I would look on ebay for something in the price range of $120. I have seen some really nice cameras being sold for only 120 dollars. I'm serious if you have any questions about this camera feel free to email me at Sail36@aol.com....I would love to help out in your decision.<br><br>
