            My parents bought me my 1999 Chevrolet Malibu in March of 1999 and I love it!!!  After shopping around, I fell in love with the Malibu.  It was exactly what I wanted; small yet roomy, sophisticated yet affordable; and cruise control with wonderful gas mileage.  Gas mileage and cruise control were big factors in my decision because I go to college almost 400 miles away from home.  The cruise control on the 1999 Malibu is easy to control since all buttons are right in front of you on the steering wheel.  Also the gas mileage is amazing.  I can make it all the way from my home in New Orleans to Louisiana Tech in Ruston on one tank of gas!!!  This long trip doesn't bother me at all because I enjoy my Malibu so much.  The way it handles those curves of the highway, the comfortable seats, and the quiet ride make my trip so pleasurable.  If I didn't have coffee on those long trips, I'd fall asleep in the sofa-like comfort of the seats!  The way my V6 handles those curves and hills is amazing.  I set my cruise on 70mph and it doesn't even strain or fluctuate speed at all when I'm on those roller coaster of hills.  Other features that I enjoy are the automatic lights and other chiming reminders.  I am a forgetful person and it is very helpful that the Malibu automatically turns the headlights on at night and off when you park, chimes when I'm on empty, and doesn't let me drive with the parking brake on.  All these feature have helped me tremendously and saved me from killing my battery too!  The Malibu is not only fun to drive, but safe, comfortable and stylish.  I would recommend that anyone car shopping for a four door sedan should test drive a Malibu.  The drive will amaze you!!!  If you'd like to hear a parents point of view on the Malibu, read the epinion titled Dee (that's my mom!).    <br><br>
