            I'd previously driven a small, underpowered 1985 Corolla, but boy was I surprised by the 2004 Corolla S which I bought!  Precise power steering made this vehicle easy to maneuver safely and precisely in any tight situation, either changing lanes on the interstate, making a tight turn, or just plain parking at the local supermarket.  Acceleration was quite impressive getting on the interstate, as my wife insisted she have something with some power, but not gobble gas like a big V-8.  The four cylinder engine matched with the 4 speed transmission was ideal for this purpose, and allowed us to merge into high speed traffic with ease.  What really impressed me about this new Corolla was the amount of interior room, especially in the seats.  I'm tall, about 6'1", and had plenty of headroom to spare whether I sat in the front or back seats.  Also, there was ample leg room in the back seat, though the front driver's seat was a bit tight until I figured out that recline the seat a few inches made all the difference in the world.  Then, it was smooth sailing on the interstate with the cruise control on and the tremendous radio pumping out some good music.  A lot of features are standard on this vehicle, so the only option I chose was the keyless remote.
