            I purchased this vehicle about 5 years ago and I'm just sold on Jeeps! I paid a pretty penny and got it fully loaded with all the trimmings(Leather seats, V8, 4WD, 12 Disc CD Changer and so on..) and I absolutely love it.

The first thing that caught my intention was the smooth ride and the nice power it had, and it just got better and better.  I've actually never once needed to do any work on the car besides an oil change or tune up.  The gas mileage is decent at about 20 mpg and the cars handling is great!
There is really nothing I dislike about this vehicle.

I've gone to the mountains many times, just so I can drive it there.  The reason for this, is that it just tackles the mountain so well with absolutely no struggle!

I completely recommend this car to all who are looking for a solid SUV at a great price with nice features.  It's a fantastic overall package!<br><br>
