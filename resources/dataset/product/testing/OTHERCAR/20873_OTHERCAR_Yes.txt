            I had the opportunity to test drive a PT Cruiser at my local Chrysler dealer last weekend.  I was told there is a 6 month waiting list and there are absolutely no price negotiation on this vehicle.  I wanted to take a look at the PT Cruiser since I have been anticipating its arrival for some time.  All the car magazines have given the PT Cruiser extensive advance publicity.  Early reviews have been mostly good.  Though I just bought a new vehicle in February for myself, my domestic partner wants a new car for Christmas and I plan to be obliging.  The PT Cruiser was on his shopping list.

The PT Cruiser is a great looking car.  It successfully blends design elements from the 1930's into a very fresh and contemporary design.  Nothing else on the road looks anything like it and that is a plus these days, with all the boring, cookie-cutter car designs on the road.  The car I test drove was a silver Limited Edition model priced around $21,000.00 - and it was pretty much fully equipped. 

The car seemed well put together, but the hood already had two paint bubbles on it, which is not, to say the least, very encouraging.  I noticed this defect almost immediately and I wonder why it left the factory that way - or why the dealer did not have the hood repainted if the bubbles developed after delivery.  Otherwise, exterior build quality looked pretty good for an early production American designed car.  The PT Cruiser is actually assembled in Mexico.

The interior is incredibly roomy for such a small car.  The rear seats have a seemingly endless variety of configurations that enable one to create many different shapes and sizes of storage space.  I am six feet, three inches tall and I found both front and rear leg room to be very generous.  Head room is ample as well, even with a sunroof.  In some ways though, the design of the interior is a bit of a letdown.  While attractive, the car's interior simply lacks the freshness and imagination of the exterior.  The plastics and switchgear are definitely of Chrysler quality - which is to say cheap, flimsy and generally not very good.  Interior workmanship was okay, but no more than that.  

I found it difficult to find the right driving position and the seat lacked sufficient lumbar support, at least for someone my height.  Visibility is very good and the driving position offers a commanding view of the road.  Controls and instruments are legible and for the most part logically laid out.  The stereo sounded very tinny and if I bought a PT Cruiser, my next purchase would be a better stereo system. The air conditioning worked well.

But I was truly disappointed in how the PT Cruiser drives.  The handling is secure, but not the least bit sporty.  The steering felt a bit loose and vague and road feel was noticeably absent.  The engine was noisy when revved, but that is to be expected from a 4 cylinder engine.  The car braked well on drive pavement, but I have not driven one in rain or snow. The PT Cruiser I drove had an automatic transmission, truly the car's fatal flaw.  

When I tried to get any power out of the engine, the transmission downshift pattern was alarming.  If you press the accelerator to the floor, you experience about 2 seconds of hesitation while the transmission hunts for passing gear and you go next to nowhere.  This robs the engine of its available power and could pose a safety hazard while trying to pass other vehicles on two lane highways. The available five speed manual transaxle may more responsive and fun to drive, but I have not heard any glowing reviews of the Neon's five speed transaxle.  The Neon is the source of most of the PT Cruiser's components, including the manual transmission; however, the Neon's 3 speed automatic transmission is not - thank goodness - used in the PT Cruiser.

Come to think of it, deja vu knocked on my door while test driving the PT Cruiser.  Driving this car reminded of an experience I had way back in 1995, when I first drove a Dodge Neon.  The steering was vague, controls and materials were cheap, seats were unsupportive, the engine was noisy - but the PT Cruiser sure looks better than that Neon ever did.  But looks aside, I could only recommend this car to someone willing to take a risk on a first year model built by a car company known for great styling and poor quality.  Perhaps my recommended second purchase would be an extended warranty, not a stereo system.

The PT Cruiser - like the VW New Beetle before it - will be purchased by people for emotional rather than practical reasons.  The styling will primarily sell this car, though of course the PT Cruiser also has great utility and practicality.  And for some people, the car's shortcomings will be more than outweighed by its styling and flair.  I am just not one of those people.  <br><br>
