            I just recently got one of these from Ritzcamera.com auctions.  I only paid $250 so I cant really complain about it But to remover ther flash card you have to open the battery cover leaving the batteries in the camera while taking the card out is not easy!!!

As with all digitals batteries will cost you more than regular film, so use some that you can recharge.

Pictures are pretty good and software easy if not very fast.

The camera looks solidly build and is attractive.

easy to use menu and tv viewing is possible.

Not bad for $250

Not great at $500!!<br><br>
