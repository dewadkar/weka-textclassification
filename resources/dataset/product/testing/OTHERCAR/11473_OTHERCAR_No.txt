            I bought this car, new, in 1995 because of all the wonderful things I'd heard about Saturn, particularly about their customer service, and reliability, and safety record.  I had several problems with the car while it was still under warranty.  I've had it for three years, and am on my third sunroof, as the others warped, and rusted.  The air conditioner/defrost system is a wreck.  It has leaked odd mists, failed to defrost, and every year I've had to add fluid.  Though I had it checked each year for a leak, they continually told me there wasn't one, until a month after the warranty lapsed, when I was having the fluid refilled for the third time, and they told me there may be a leak.  Now, shy of 30,000 miles, the headlight &quot;motor&quot; is broke ($300), I need new brakes, I've bought new tires, and have had continual alignment problems, and I'm told the alternator may need to be replaced.  Also, it is an incredibly squeaky, car, with many rattles, and when I've taken it in to ask about this, I was told, &quot;Oh, that's a Saturn noise!&quot;  I would NEVER again buy another Saturn because of my experience.  It is the worst car I've ever owned (and I've owned a number of cars!)<br><br>
