            I drove my 1996 Neon cross country, and got terrific gas mileage!   The ride was a little hard, and being a light car the wind tends to blow you around.  
I traded my '96 Neon in for the Neon 2000.  The 2000 is less noisy, and a little smoother than the '96 model.  The 5 speed is fun to drive!  The size makes parking, and U-turns easy.
For the price, you get a lot of car.  This is a good second car for a family, great for people of any height of age(it has great head room, and is easy to get in and out of).
I enjoy my NEON, that's why I named her Sassy!<br><br>
