            Unfortunately, the Volvo S40 is not as popular in the US as it is in Europe. In Europe, the cars of the S40 size are considered family cars because they are quite roomy, are easy to park, have good fuel consumption and drive well. But in the US, the small premium cars are a tough sell. Because of that, my girlfriend was able to get an S40 for $5000+ off the sticker price.

The 2004 S40 is available in base form as well as in Luxury trim. The best choice was the S40 with Sport package and here is why:

1. It replaces the base model&#146s 195/60HR15 tires on 15-inch wheels with 215/50R16 on 16-inch wheels, which mitigates the wheelspin exiting turns. The base model as well as the Luxury Package equipped one have narrow wheels that struggle to cope with the turbocharged engine&#146s 170 horses.
2. It adds front and rear spoilers, fog lamps and nice &#147Alluminum Effect&#148 interior trim (called &#147Cyborg&#148).
3. It adds premium speaker system, which sounds simply excellent.
4. It adds leather wrapped stearing wheel and better seats with small leather inserts.
5. It only cost $550.

The only drawback to getting the Sport package was a tacky-looking spoiler, which obscures rearward visibility somewhat. I wonder if it generates any downforce.

We drove both the narrow-tired Luxury Package model (which is expensive, has moonroof that intrudes into the headroom and still has narrow tires that spin exiting corners) and the Sport Package equipped model, which has much better tracktion and handling, comfortable seats, excellent speakers and nice, albeit funky called, &#147Cyborg&#148 trim.

The S40 sold in the States come with 1.9-liter low-pressure turbo 4-cylinder 170 hp engine, 5-speed auto transmission, CD player, power windows, door locks and mirrors, auto climate control, ABS, cruise control, alloy wheels, full array of airbags (front, side and head), Volvo&#146s Whiplash Protection System.

<b>Driving</b>

One thing that disappoints me is rearward visibility both directly rearward (obstructed by the wing on the trunklid) and rear-sidewise (C-pillars). The car drives well with well-damped body motions and not much body roll in turns. The acceleration and braking are impressive as is the fuel economy. The throttle feels a bit artificial, however, there is not-so direct relation between the pedal travel and acceleration / engine response.

The turbocharged engine works well in the mountains and the transmission downshifts as needed quite well. However, the 5-speed automatic transmission doesn't have the second gear manual selection. You can select first gear ("L"), 1-3 range ("3"), 1-4 range or 1-5 ("D"). There is no "2" position for the 1-2 range, which would be very useful in the mountains going downhill as the first gear is too slow and the third does not provide enough engine braking.

The instruments are legible and the controls are quite ergonomic overall. The seats are excellent if a little small.

<b>Interior</b>

The interior is well constructed and is very functional. It definitely looks better with Sport Package&#146s seats and Cyborg trim than in its standard form.

The radio has good reception as it employs a telescopic antenna that extends by means of an electric motor. The CD player and speakers provide excellent sound with good imaging and frequency response. The air conditioning has automatic mode where it supports the temperature you set. It is controlled by three round dials.

<b>Styling</b>

Unlike some people, I like the S40&#146s European styling. Although it is not as athletic as Audi&#146s recent designs, it is functional, tasteful and very... Swedish?

<b>Trunk</b>

The trunk is surprisingly roomy and the trunklid has an inside handle for closing it without having to touch the outside of the lid. The gas-filled struts do not intrude in the cargo space.

<b>Maintenance</b>

Volvo provides free maintenance for 3 years or 36,000 miles with service intervals of 7,500 miles. The service has been quick so far.

<b>Bottom Line</b>

<i>Although you can get bigger and possibly more reliable car with more options for the same money, it will not be as originally-looking, stylish and comfortable. If you don&#146t want to drive something that looks like what everybody else drives, the S40 may be just the perfect car for you.</i>
