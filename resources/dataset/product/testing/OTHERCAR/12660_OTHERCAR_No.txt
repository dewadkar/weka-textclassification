            Jaguar S Type 4.0

Recently on a trip to Las Vegas I had need of a rental car. I have Gold Membership with Hertz and Wizard (huh?) Membership with Avis. These memberships stem from a recent time when,living in downtown Chicago, I didn't feel the need to have a car permanently on call.
During the year 2000 however I totalled up my car rental bills and found that I was renting at the rate of $1000 a month. Great googly-moogly!!! None of these drives were for business reasons and were coming from my own pocket.

I eventually bought a good car-a BMW 3 series, reviewed elsewhere, and was living happily ever after.

However, I occasionally still need a rental from time to time. Avis in the past was getting most of my business based in large part on the variety of cars available. With Hertz it was, as one would expect from the parent company,  the Ford/Mercury/Lincoln line of cars with the occasional Jeep thrown in. Avis had GMs extensive line plus gems like the Nissan Maxima and Altima.

Hertz has since "upped the ante" over Avis by introducing their "Prestige" Line which includes new members of the Ford Automotive Group-Volvo and Jaguar.

I booked a Jaguar S Type on the Hertz web site for pickup in McCarran airport Las Vegas last week at a rate of $120 a day before the many and various taxes are applied: airport tax, concession fee recovery, adjusting the seat tax, over-filling the ashtray tax, left-turn tax and so on.
I did get a 15% AAA deduction which basically paid for the "honking at pretty girls tax".

Hertz #1 Gold Club is a time saver in many ways. You give them your account number and they have all your personal info on file and don't waste your (my) time trying to sell you insurance and such.

I took a cab from the Bellagio hotel (another review) to the off-airport lot, walked in, gave my name when asked and was on my way. I actually had my driver's lisence and credit card out to show but the counter clerk said he didn't need them. I like that.

My name was on a billboard, showing the location of the car and all the paperwork was in the car waiting.

The first thing I have to say about the Jaguar S Type is that it is a very handsomely sculpted vehicle. It is eye candy of the first order. The hood lines, especially with the sweeping curves that run from the windshield to the 4 headlights, are the kind of shapes that make you want to get into the thing and fire it up. The wiser man in me of course is well aware that any automaker is capable of bending thin sheets of metal and that the proof of the pudding is in the driving-er, well-you know what I mean. Speaking of pudding I am getting hungry....but I will press on!

As is wise when picking up a rental car I walked around the car first checking for dings and scratches. The car had silver metallic paint,very lustrous- but had many scratches.

Once inside and satisfied with the deep solid thud from the driver's door I was sitting on a silvery-white leather seat. I had to adjust the electric seat to get closer to the pedals (two in number). The engine-a 4.0 liter V8 started almost immediately,which is not how I remembered British cars of yore (I am British) and settled down to a quiet hum.

Controls in the Jaguar cockpit fell readily to hand and were intuitive-no need to reach for the manual to get the thing rolling along. Steering in the parking lot was heavily power-assisted but tightened up at speed somewhat.

At the check-out gate I opted for the Pre-Pay gas option-an 18 gallon tank of  premium gas for $22 which works out at less than $1.25 a gallon and saves you(me!) the hassle of looking for a gas station on returning the car. This makes sense if you figure on using most of the gas on your 
travels. I invariably do.

I had opted for the Hertz "Never-Lost" navigation system-a no cost option. I set it to guide me back to my hotel even though I could see it in the distance. It worked well except in that later it didn't recognise the Hoover dam as a destination.

The speed limit was 35mph so I had to dribble along in traffic. The car was very comfortable and was already getting looks from other drivers and pedestrians. My ego was growing so big I had to open the moonroof (one-touch open and tilt)

At the hotel I parked the car and as my friend and I were heading out for an afternoon of touring I opened the trunk to check for luggage space and to load up the cd changer magazine there. The trunk is long and wide but rather shallow- it later held a small carry-on, a garment bag a laptop and an overnight bag but I couldn't imagine more than one full-size suitcase fitting in due to the restricted height.
Unfortunately the cd magazine would not respond to my "eject" command(nor to the Hertz representative's when I returned the car a few days later)

We set off for a drive to the Hoover dam without cd entertainment. We had FM radio but the reception was always fuzzy and static laden, no matter which station.

Once on the highway-I95 and travelling at over 70mph I realised that the "brakes" as they were mistakenly called were not up to the task of slowing down a car weighing 4,000lbs.
The car had 10,880 miles on the odometer but that's no excuse. The brakes felt like I was stepping on a slowly deflating basketball-I know they were trying to slow the spinning wheels and God bless 'em for trying but they were inept and out of place on a car who's MSRP is $49995.
Had I never driven a car before I would have thought- "ah well, maybe this is what brakes are" but I drive on a daily basis a car who has wonderfully responsive brakes. 
With the Jaguar I could have sworn when I stepped on the fat pedal that I could hear the brakes saying "do we have to??" Whereas the BMW brakes say-"you want to stop?Ok-we're stopped hotshot....what's next?"

V8 engines with over 280 hp are great-but you need the brakes that can halt that hurtling metal in an instant. I don't tailgate ever-I drive defensively, but these brakes alone would keep me out of a Jaguar. 

It's a fine touring car-strong engine, supple ride, comfortable leather seats, moonroof, dual climate control with digital readout which I loved and made much use of. It has strong headlights and fog lights fore and aft. The heater and A/C are fast acting and easy to adjust to the right temperature.
All the interior and exterior electrics worked as expected. You ride in comfort that's for sure.

We stopped at the Hoover Dam,less than an hour from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas and enjoyed this magnificent engineering achievement. A friendly guide suggested a trip to the Valley of Fire which is a scenic drive of spectacular proportions, and involved a drive around the undulating coastline of Lake Mead.

We put a fresh Coke in the one usable cupholder and set off.

The road around Lake Mead is Highway 159 if memory serves and we began a 60 mile trip on what was a rollercoaster of a road....hilly, twisty- around every bend and over every steep hill was a jaw-dropping panorama of mountains and lake and freshly paved with the smoothest black tarmac a man could wish for.

As someone who loves to drive, I was in Heaven-or would have been with a better handling car.

The Jaguar's transmission was very slow to downshift when encountering a steep hill and when I did get it moving at a fair clip-over 80 or so I  had to keep in mind the brakes and so a few turns were taken a tad too fast for comfort as I was unable to scrub off enough speed. Real brakes on this car would make it fun to drive-and much safer! The hand-brake, by the way was to the left of the passenger seat.

When we stopped at a scenic overlook to take some video shots, my friend asked me to turn off the engine as it was so noisy at idle outside the car. Up front the fan was indeed whirring away but at the rear of the car was where the problem was-a very rough sputtering idle
from the twin exhausts. I turned the engine off for some peace and quiet. She stooped down to pick up her maps which fell from the shallow door pockets each time she opened the door.

After 60 miles or so of spectacular canyon scenery we joined I15 and headed the 30 miles or so back to Las Vegas. The Jag eats up the miles and cocoons it's passengers in comfort. The ivory leather showed many scuff marks from previous careless renters but would come back to life with an application of Lexol.



In summing up- the Jaguar S Type is a handsome comfortable vehicle. It will certainly turn heads as you drive along. Is it worth $50,000???


Well, when I think of the cars one could buy for that kind of money and include names like a BMW 540i or M3 and the many Lexus,Mercedes and Audis that come under that lofty threshold-I would think one would have to be so enamoured of the car's shape and comforts to overlook the price and the competition.

While I could live for a couple of days without the CD changer' the weak brakes shattered my confidence in the car, particularly as I did a lot of mountain driving.


It is at least possible now to rent one for a week and give it a thorough test drive, thanks to Hertz.

I intend to return to Las Vegas in the near future and when I do I will rent another S Type just incase the few problems I found were atypical.

Hertz Prestige line also features Volvos; S60 and S80
