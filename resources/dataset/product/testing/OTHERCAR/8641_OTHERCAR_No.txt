               Ok, I didn't have an 87 but it is almost identical to the 84 S#!tvette I did own about 15 years ago. I decided to look up the Chevette on a whim and was suprised to see anything positive at all.

   The engine: In spite of it's dimunitive displacement and complete lack of anything resembling power, my Chevette never really did better than 20 mpg. this may be due in part to having automatic transmission. By comparison, my mom had a 1977 Volkswagen Rabbit with an automatic and almost identical displacement never failed to get 30 mpg. The Rabbit would absolutely pound the Chevette in acceleration. The engineer that designed the component layout in the engine compartment should be shot. (Ok, not shot, I don't want him or her dead, but they should be really embarrassed)Wanna do a quick tune up? Remove the air-conditioning compressor to access the distributor. It's an overhead cam engine. What is the distributor doing down there anyway? Need to change the starter? (and you will) Start by removing the intake manifold. That's right, the whole intake manifold. I've been told that you can just remove the steering column but it was the manifold for me.
   The brakes: Ok, no dancing around it here. THE BRAKES SUCK!!!I pulled everything apart and everything worked. It all just worked poorly. An interesting note: I thought I might have had some air in the brakes from the sponginess of the brake pedal. I bled, and bled, and bled the brakes until I noticed THE WHOLE FIREWALL FLEXES when the pedal is pushed. I felt so safe. Not to worry though. In an emergency situation, simply turn the A/C to max. It effectively stops all forward motion.
   Interior and controls: The stereo was simple with big pushbuttons and the old two knob style for tuning and volume. I was sure to make note of the weird pictographs of like a 16th note for volume and a transmitter antenna for tuning. I noticed this as it was being thrown in the trash. It was junk. The wiper switch was typical GM except no interval. Headlamps were a simple pull knob. A/C controls were pretty typical of GM at that time also, fairly simple but not backlighted so set the climate controls before it gets dark. The A/C was very good. Same compressor as a Suburban. You could store ice cream in there if you could keep the engine running. Between the front seats is a HUGE hump in the floor to accomodate a TH180 (most Chevettes) or a TH200 (also used in full sized cars)Both are good transmissions but it severely limits the amount of foot room availiable. The speedometer was entertaining. To determine your speed just add the highest number indicated to the lowest indicated (as the needle swings wildly back and forth) and divide by two.
   The rest: The rear axle was this big, sealed, weird unit that doesn't look like anything else on the road. No problems from it though. I had some minor rust on the body around the rear wheel wells. This is pretty unusual in the Southwest, DFW to be specific. Snowbelt Chevettes have probably disolved completely by now like so many slugs in the salt. Seriously, I understand that having the front shock towers rust out completely among other front suspension componenents. Handling in bad weather wasn't really that bad considering it was rear wheel drive. Guess it didn't have enough power to get into trouble.
