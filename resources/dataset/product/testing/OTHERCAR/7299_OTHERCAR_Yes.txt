            UPDATE: 3/13/02 My camera no longer works as of 2 months ago.  My 2yr old dropped the camera.  I left it on the table and little hands found it.  The zoom stopped working and any pictures taken with the camera are extremly out of focus.  I called Olympus, they said I could send it in for repairs and they would see if it could be fixed, but I would have to pay for the repairs since acts of toddlers are not covered by the warranty.

I'm really surprised it broke so easily.  It must have hit the ground just right.  I'm planning on buying another digital camera soon.  I liked this olympus, so I will probably look at some of their newer digital cameras.

Original Review:
The Olympus D460 zoom is a great entry level digital camera.  

The camera is 1.3 megapixel, has a 3x optical zoom, 2x digital zoom, uses smartmedia and has a fairly easy to use menu system.  

I think the most important feature on the camera is the 3x optical zoom.  Since the 3x zoom is optical and not digital you will not see the "jaggy" lines in your images.  

You can either use the view finder of the video screen to take pictures.  If you use the video screen your battery life will decrease rapidly.

The flash on this camera is pretty good.  It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like other cameras.  The flash has several features as well - auto flash, red eye reduction, slow sync and flash fill in.  I use the red eye reduction the most and it works well.

This camera also gives you the ability to control some exposure settings and iso film speed settings.  I have not used these features yet so I cannot say how well they work.

The menu system is a little confusing to start with, but within 10-20 minutes of use you should have everything figured out.  I have yet to see a digital camera with a good menuing system.

Some people have reported that you have to use special batteries with this camera.  That is not true.  The batteries that come with the camera are special batteries - but you can use 4AA batteries with the camera.  In fact I buy a bulk pack of AA batteries from costco to use with this camera.

When using AA batteries with this camera you will only get about a week of heavy use out of the camera.  By heavy use I mean filling up the smartmedia card every day. 

The only other problem with this camera is how you have to connect it to the computer.  I really don't understand why digital cameras are still being made with serial connections.  This makes the image transfers to the PC incredibly slow. 

If you do buy this camera I would suggest you also invest in a USB smart card reader.  This will save you hours in the first to months of use.
