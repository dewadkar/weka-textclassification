            several times i have had the chance to drive my friend's cutlass.  while it's lightyears better than her now deceased '90 cavalier, the interior annoyances are things i simply cannot get over.  the seat simply does not tilt back.  and being a 6 ft+ person, my face feels like it is in the windshield and chest in the steering wheel.  never mind how i look in this car!  and what is up with the automatic door-lock feature?  if i had to get out of this car in a hurry, i'd never make it.  you must manually open the door locks (or press the power lock button--same difference) to get out, which continues to frustrate me.  you cannot manipulate the heat/air vent to go only to your feet, or in the console vents.  oldsmobile figures you don't care about it and simply gives you a &quot;heat&quot; or &quot;defrost&quot; setting on the dash.
   however, the engine power is adequate enough for most drivers, but you'll never have your breath taken away.  and why does the gas gauge swim back and forth from empty to 1/4 full?  it is very inaccurate; reminds me of my parents' dodge shadow.
   the looks of this car say &quot;retirement&quot; all over it.  the styling has the excitement of a mid-80s compact sedan...boxy.  however, i must say that the car has been reliable at its 90k mark for my friend and myself, has spongy but predictable handling, and is pretty quiet inside. it'd be a great first car for someone who cared more about transportation than looks or creature comforts.<br><br>
