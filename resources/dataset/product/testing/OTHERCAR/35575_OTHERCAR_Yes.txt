              The Honda Civic, which is just naturally cute and has been since the day it came out, has really grown up over the past few years.  They made it more powerful and loaded it down with a ton of options and features.  This is the perfect car for:  (A) a new driver (B) someone who doesn't want to pay a lot for a quality car (C) someone who wants a cute car =)

  This car comes 4-cylinder in all models with the horsepower ranging from 115-117 @ 6100 and in the EX, 127 @ 6300.  The EX and HX also come with a V-Tech engine, which is known for speed and high performance racing in many foreign cars.  All the models are available in either 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmissions.

  Anti-lock braking is also available on all models, although with some it is considered optional.    As for wheels you have a choice of 14 inch or 15 inch in alloy or wheel covers.  I strongly suggest against wheel covers because I have seen more than one case where they start to peel and crack and basically look like crap with normal wear-and-tear.  This is not at all attractive and in the long run it's more sensible to pay extra for the alloy wheels.

This car is quite roomy.  Headroom ranges from 36.9 - 39 inches in the front and 35 inches to 35.4 in the rear.  Legroom in all models is 42.5 in the front and 32.8 in the rear.  This is not at all bad when you consider that the Honda Civic Coupe is a fairly small, compact car.  The trunk has an amazing 12.9 cubic feet which can be put into great use when moving or going on trips!

Exterior colors include "Clover Green Pearl", "Tafetta White", "Rally Red", "Satin Silver Metallic", "Nighthawk Black Pearl, "Eternal Blue Pearl", and "Titanium Metallic".  Interior colors, which are available in either cloth or leather, consist of beige or black.  Choosing the color of your car is a big decision, but Honda makes it a little easier since all their colors are gorgeous...the only problem?  Since they are all beautiful, this may be the hardest decision of your car-buying experience!
