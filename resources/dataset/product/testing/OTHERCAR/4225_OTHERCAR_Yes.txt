            I have driven many cars, but nothing compares to a Cadillac. The Lincoln Town Car is nice, but too boaty. The Lexus does not ride as nice as a Cadillac. The Cadillac DeVille is the perfect balance between comfort, soft ride, high performance, and good handling. The only gripe I have is that it is damn expensive to fix. Repair costs are high on a Cadillac, as parts are pricy, mechanical systems are complicated and few problems are easy to fix without the help of a mechanic. Fortunately I do NOT have the Northstar engine, which is even more complicated, and expensive and difficult to fix. I just have a regular General Motors 300 ci (4.9 Liter) engine with 200 Horses, which is plenty of power to get this baby going. My grandfather owned this car, and I took it when he passed away. He had had several problems with the heater core, and it appears that I will need to have it flushed again because the heat, once again, does not seem to be working. But the air conditioning is great, the car is all-and-all reliable, and the ride is excellent. The seats are not quite as soft as my seats in my 1979 and 1983 Cadillacs, but they are ergonomically designed well and are very comfortable. The car is also very stylish and elegant. The stereo has very good sound, but I need a CD player so I will be replacing that.

UPDATE: I discovered that there is a common problem with this car, related to electrolysis , which causes heater cores to clog, as described above. My mechanic's solution was to install a less narrow heater core, and so far it has worked fine. Another mechanic at the Cadillac dealer also told me something about fixing a ground wire. I don't know the full details of this solution, so contact a Cadillac dealer. Please don't be discouraged about buying this car because of this - this is an excellent automobile. Since my mechanic installed the less-thin heater core, my heater core has not clogged and i have had perfect heat. I may also look into that ground wire thing.
