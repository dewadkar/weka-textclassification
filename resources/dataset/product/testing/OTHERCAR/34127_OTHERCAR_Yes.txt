                I bought my 240SX used around 2 years ago.  Since then I've put on close to 30,000 miles and the car has been outstanding.  The interior build quality is excellent and mechanically it has proven to be very reliable.  Even after 30,000 miles, it is still a joy to drive.
    I have had a few problems with the car.  Since I bought the car, I have had to replace both oxygen sensors (about $75 each), plugs, wires, and a new front main seal(about $100).  Also, the temperature control lights on the dash burnt out.  Overall, its been a very trouble-free car.
    If you in the market for a sports car, I would definitely recommend the 240SX.  It has good acceleration and handles great without being punishing.  The engine is very quiet, if a bit rough, and the ride is smooth and quiet.  If you are looking for a car to move a lot of people or a lot of luggage, this it not the car for you.  For 2 passengers, the interior is roomy, for any more, its very cramped.  The trunk is fairly small with room for a few small bags.  Also, if you are a person who does not like to wash their car, I would not recommend this car.  I've noticed a small rust spot starting on the seams in the rear wheel wells that is easily fixed with some sand paper and touch up paint, but the car should be washed often to prevent this from happening.  Also, the wheels are getting discolored from salt.  I am not sure if these problems are just on my car or are common to all 240SXs, but if you are looking to buy one, it is definitely something to look for.
    If you are looking for a car to upgrade to make it faster, this car responds well to modifications.  I have installed an Apex'i N1 exhaust, a Random Tech cat and a Hot Shot header as well as a set of Suspension Tech sway bars.  These modifications alone have made my car at least a half second quicker in the 1/4 mile (5 mph faster too) and with the sway bars the car corners totally flat.  I'm sure there is much more power left in the motor for other modifications and there is still much more you can do with the suspension.  If you are looking for a car to modify I would highly suggest that you find a car with ABS and the limited slip rear.  When I race the car I get almost no traction and I'm sure if I had a limited slip the car would be much faster.  Also, I would choose a quieter exhaust.  With the setup I have, it is extremely loud, even with a silencer.  Due to the volume of the exhaust, the car has developed some rattles.
    Overall, I consider this an excellent car and would recommend it to anyone.
