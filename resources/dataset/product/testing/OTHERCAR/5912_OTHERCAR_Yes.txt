            The problem with people nowadays is that they want to take the idea of something rough and tumble and cosmopolitanize it.  

The SUV is that.  SUV's used to have the reputation of the tough, go anywhere trucks that were based on pickup bodies.  The classic example was the old Range Rover Defenders that were seen everywhere from the Sahara to the rain forest of Brazil.

Nowadays, SUV's can barely do offroading things due to the fear of tipping over, the lack of a solid axle suspension and a frame designed from a car, not a truck.  And forget about Range Rovers.  Since they go for 50K+, no one would dare screw up their insurance and go out into the great outdoors.

The Rodeo is a throwback to the old days where trucks were trucks.  It has a solid rear axle and is not the smoothest rider around.  Sure, Isuzu has gotten into the 20th century by offering a higher revving all aluminum V-6 engine, but it still has the tried and true part time 4wd with low range (seems not be offered much anymore.)

My Rodeo was the S model and it was pretty bare.  It had no power windows or lock, but did have CD, A/C and Automatic.  Of course I bought it 2 years used for $13.5K with 30K on the Odometer.  It had a utilitarian interior, but the fabrics were durable and tough, and it didn't stain when I put my surfboard/wetsuit, Skiis, Snowboard or Mountain bike in it.  No butter soft leather for this hombre.  

It was also durable and the V6 was quiet and smooth.  It could carry my Jetskis or ATV without any questions.  I have taken it offroading and those who whine about the suspension on smooth pavement will kiss the Rodeo's butt when they realize (if they ever go on anything other than asphalt) that this suspension will take them places Lexus 300's, Ford Expeditions and Navigators cannot begin to come close to.

I'm not impressed with all these people civilizing what has always been a workhorse.  They are foolish to believe (IMHO) that driving an un-nimble, tall center of gravity, poor suspensioned TRUCK is safer than driving a car.  The only thing safe about an SUV is that you are more likely to survive an accident (while probably killing the other person), but if that is your goal from the getgo, you know you should probably not be driving....
