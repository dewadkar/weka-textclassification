            Ever since I can remember, I've loved Mercedes-Benz cars - not because all the rich people drove them, not because the German engineering was (and still is) simply the best and blends the best characteristics of sports, luxury, automotive technology, and safety, but for a very simple, nay childlike, reason - the cars had SPIRIT to them.  Just as I pretended that my G.I. Joe  action figures, toy robots, even spaceships had minds and hearts of their own, so I FELT that the magical cars with the three-pointed stars had lives all their own.
I'm sure that my father had much to do with it.  You see, he bought one of the last 450 SELs, in 1980, and neither he nor I could get enough of that car.  It was his lifelong dream to own a Mercedes-Benz, and I am sure that to this day, he remembers the feel, the smell, the motion, the RESPONSIVENESS, the POWER of that amazing automobile.
Fast forward a decade or two, and this little voice is telling me to GO FOR IT, to buy a Mercedes.  Sure, I had driven Hondas and Subarus, and knew them for what they were -  good, dependable, inexpensive cars, easy on the eyes and the wallet.  However, I had NEVER owned or really driven my own Mercedes-Benz; could I really afford to drive and enjoy one?
Well, I took the plunge and grabbed the best model I could buy - a 1991 560 SEC with 99,500 miles on it.  The Mercedes dealership said that the original owner took such good care of it that they did very little 'conditioning' prior to putting it up for sale.  It mattered little to me; when I saw it, I knew that this was THE ONE.
The actual negotiation and sale is still a blur to this day, and yet, three hours had gone by before we shook on the deal.  They let me drive the car home, and ALL the memories I had of being in a Mercedes came flooding back.  The car fairly SLID down the road, GLIDING as if it was a hovercraft flying just above the ground.  I guessed that fighter pilots had the same sensation of purposeful and directed POWER, completely under control and yet ready to be tapped to the full at a moment's notice.
Well, as the months went by, I just couldn't stop looking at that car.  I literally smiled almost every time I parked it and looked back at it.  I felt like a starship captain every time I drove it, and, like any other ship-of-the-line, I fed it the proper fuel, kept up the regular maintenance, and basically enjoyed the hell out of the car.  Even though I had never pushed her past eighty, I knew that she had at least another 50-60 mph in reserve.
Of course, as with any luxury or sports car, even basic maintenance was fairly expensive; however, I saw BMW 3-series, 5-series, and 7-series , Jaguar XJ6s, XJ8s and Vanden Plas, and I had no doubt that I could SMOKE any of them.  The price I paid was well worth the costs that came with it.
Well, I am happy to say that I still have the car (with 128,000 miles on it and doing very well, thank you very much).  The ceiling leather is sagging a little, and since I've owned it, I've replaced the air conditioning circuit three or four times (about $60 every time).  I still  get the same feelings of POWER, RESPONSIVENESS, SAFETY, and PURPOSEFUL DESIGN whenever I drive my car.  God willing, I'll drive her until she gives up the ghost gracefully.  I really think that when Mercedes-Benz created this masterpiece, they were striving for automotive perfection, and even though this, like any car, falls short, I believe that the 560 SEC could easily be a 'Boddhisattva', an automobile in the process of becoming perfection.  Remember, this car was (and in some respects still is) the TOP-OF-THE-LINE.
