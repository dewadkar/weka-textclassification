            This is one of the best cars I've ever owned, &amp; why did I buy this car, well 1st off I was in the Market for a new TransAM but my only problem with that was, insureance, it costs too much when your only 23 and you automaticly get put on high risk.  So knowing that I was looking around &amp; noticed the Grand Prix, it was very attractive,lots of room, leather &amp; everything, the Stereo sounds wonderful for factory,lots of trunk room, ok so then I left the dealership, did some reasearch on this car, noticed I was liking the GTP, all until I had come to find out about the SLP Model called GTX which is basicly a $5,600 upgrade if you have the $$$ for this I highly recommend this because it adds more great items to your car such as, high performance exhast, ram air, cold air intake, beautiful chrome 17&quot; wheels with tires, &amp; more.  So knowing the info I had, I went to my dealer placed the order.  But that was only after taking a GTP for a Test Spin.  On this Test Drive I noticed this car had good power for a V6 it turned very well with with it's Wide Track Feature, the speed also shoots up on the Windsheild along with car info &amp; radio stations making it safer for you as you don't have to look down off the road, radio controls are on the steering wheel.  Ok so I am at my Dealer I place the order for a Black GTP 2000, then request it be sent to SLP for the GTX Conversion, which all went great, all I can say is when this car arrived on the Lot it looked diff from all the other Grand Prix, it drew the attn from everyone.  Many people wanted to buy the car that they hadn't seen yet, well most haven't, only around 300 of thease are around as far as I know.  Now one thing you will want to Consider about this if you want to go with the GTX package, the Exhast does change how the car sounds personaly I love the way it sounds, but when driveing in town yes it is kinda loud inside but doesn't bother me, this is only because of the exhast system on the GTX, now if you had the GTP you whouldn't have that prob, but thats a lost of horsepower too.  Ok So I have my car I end up taking it on a 4000 mile drive.  Everything went great for me the car handled smoothly with everything.  Got around great.  Now the people who should &amp; should not buy this car, well honestly, I say buy what you think is best for you, &amp; for me at the time this is what I loved the most &amp; fit into my price range with insureance &amp; everything.  The car comes in both 2 door which I think is the sportest &amp; then the 4 door which is great if you have kids.  It's a very smooth rideing car :) hope this helps some of you out in buying :)<br><br>
