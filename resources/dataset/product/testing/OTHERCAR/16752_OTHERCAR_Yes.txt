            I am one of the younger buyers (relatively speaking) that Lincoln is trying to get into their cars with the new designs starting in 1998.  My wife and I have owned many sedans over the years, mostly S-class Mercedes.  While it is unfair to compare other full-sized cars to the new S-class, once you have experienced them they automatically become the benchmark for full sized luxury automobiles.  Having said that, I started to look for a replacement for my aging Merc Benz sedan and thought back to the best car (value, $ spent on upkeep, function, etc.) I have owned up to this point, a 1985 Mercury Grand Marquis LS.  

This led me to a search for a used Lincoln Town Car (same basic front V8, rear drive, body on frame platform as the Grand Marquis/Crown Victoria).  I researched the options available and decided that the Signature Touring Sedan was what I wanted.  After weeks of unsuccessful searching using local dealers I stumbled upon the exact car I wanted in the local paper classifieds, a 1999 Touring Sedan, Pearl white w/ light grey interior.  It has all possible options including the engine block heater (which won't ever be used thank goodness).  The Touring Sedan option, while being VERY hard to find, is well worth the search.  With it you get the dual exhaust (220hp, 290 torque), 3:55 rear gears (HUGE help on this heavy car), upgraded springs, shocks, anti-sway bars, wheels, tires, specific torque-converter, and more.  This gives the car a much more &quot;Mercedes like&quot; handling feel without sacrificing the smooth ride for which someone purchasing a Town Car is looking.  It also does away with some of the chrome which makes it look more like contemporary auto styling and less like the boxy, heavily chromed cars of years past.

I have only owned it a short while, but I am very satisfied with the value you get for the dollar spent.  While there are some that say the Town Car is a dinosaur from another age, I say that once you have owned some large Detroit Iron as well as the best that Europe has to offer, you are able to appreciate both for their strengths.  The Town Car is roomy, quiet, relatively quick (7.9 sec. 0-60 w/Touring Sedan option) and built like a tank (look underneath one to see what I mean, other cars look flimsy and toy-like in comparison).  There is a reason that livery drivers are able to put hundreds of thousands of miles on these vehicles...

Cons - Large vehicle (parking maneuvers, sliding in and out of garage, etc., take a little attention).  Front seats do not go back as far and give as much leg room as European and Asian competition (I'm 6'3&quot;).  Back seats don't have quite the room you would expect from so large a car.  New Town Cars depreciate rapidly once driven away from dealer.  Highly recommend looking for a low-mileage used one.  They tend to hold their value after first year depreciation hit.<br><br>
