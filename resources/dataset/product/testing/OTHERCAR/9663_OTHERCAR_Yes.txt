            Well first I have to say that I bought my car brand new, so it is almost 5 years later..I only have 2 payments out of 60 left, so I am VERY happy about that.  I got the car with 10 miles on it, 5 years year later I have over 135,000 miles on it & it is still going..my fiance drives daily 50 miles back & forth to work!  

The problems I had in the beginning seemed NEVER ending..my air conditioning until broke the first season, they replaced it, but it broke again the second year, by then I had already gone over the warranty so basically 1 year into owning the car I already didn't have A/C.  The front end has posed many problems, I argued with the dealership from the get go that something was wrong, they argued back that there was nothing wrong however I have replaced the tires on my 5 times in 4 years. 

The stereo is my car is great..I ordered the car especially for me so I picked the 8 speaker system with all the horns & whistles..I still think the sound is better than my fiance's new Honda...

The ride is extremely rough, hitting bumps feels extremely violent, feels like the whole car is going to fall apart.  I have had a sqeaking sound somewhere in my car since I got it, but of course the dealership didn't hear it & couldn't find it...I have had numerous other problems..the paperwork in my glove compartment is so thick it could be a dictionary.

However, in defense of the Neon however, it's still going even though the A/C isn't working, it blows oil and I just spent over $500 to fix a broken timing change & a blown head gasket...
