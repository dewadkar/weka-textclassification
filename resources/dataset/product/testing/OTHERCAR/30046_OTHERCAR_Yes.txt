            This is an excellent camera!  I've been looking at different digital cameras over the last year or so and this one actually met some of my high standards. 

EASY TO USE
First off, this camera is easy to use.  There is a simple graphically-oriented display menu that doesn't have a little of arrows and directions on it to confuse me.  I especially found it easy to scroll through the pictures I've taken and delete the ones I don't like.  

GOOD QUALITY
This camera has good quality too.  I was really surprised when I brought my pictures up in Photoshop for editing.  They weren't small and pixelated.  They were large (1700 x 1200).  I took pictures at a party with low-light, but all of my pictures came out with good colors and lighting.  Furthermore, I was taking pictures of people dancing and there wasn't much blur.  It definately exceeded my expectations.

SOME IMPROVEMENTS
There are some things I would have liked to see in the camera's performance:

* This camera has a lot of memory.  You can get 17 high-res images with the on-board memory card (8MB).  I prefer, however, to have images to be saved on floppy disks.  This is just an added convenience.  

* The DC280 is a point-and-shoot camera in capture mode.  I'd prefer to have a live-LCD display so I can see the picture I'm taking while I'm shooting. This is also just another added convenience.

* This camera also has only 2 resolution settings (High and Standard).  I'd like to get a couple other options to choose from.  In the end, there probably isn't a *real* need for too many of these options, but something else to choose from might be nice.

THE VERDICT
This is a good product.  It's easy, it's got excellent resolution and it doesn't cost as much as other high-res cameras.
