            We have owned the Lincoln Town Car for many years.  We enjoy how this car handles on the road and in town.  It is easy to drive, comfortable seats, that can be adjusted to ease tension on long drives.  We like the roominess of the inside of the car and also the trunk space.  Since we travel back and forth from Iowa to Texas, we need good space to carry those important things, such as computer and golf clubs.

We have traded for newer models every two to three years, he trades for used models from auction by a dealer..  My husband watches the mileage, so it will bring a better trade in for a newer model.  We have had no trouble with this car, we have a good service garage that takes care of our every needs.  They are very helpful to come pick up the car and return it when completed.  The thing my husband likes about the Lincoln Town Car, you can find reliable service any where in the United States.

We do make many trips to visit family members, going to football games and trips with friends.  We appreciate how easy the car drives around town and parking.  Usually my husband has to remind me, whenever I go shopping to park in an open space, so no one will bump into it.  LOL  This is just his way of saying Be Careful.  This car is a joy to own and a love to drive, check one out sometime.  TO BE WISE MEANS YOU CAN CHANGE, BUT A FOOL NEVER DOES!!!!!<br><br>
