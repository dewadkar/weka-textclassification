            A few days after my wife's Toyota was pronounced a lost case, totaled, I got in touch with our insurance agent.  The fear of a recent side collision pushed us to rent the most reliable, heavy-duty-like vehicle we can drive around.  The young, model-like car rental clerk looked at our son's hard cast and realized that we truly want security.  Then, she looked at the type of vehicle we came in as if to convince herself that we can take care of this vehicle.  When it was time for us to return this car, we started wondering whether we should go from a Toyota to a Buick.

In fact, the 2000 Regal LS is a very spacious vehicle that comes equipped with some great and useful gadgets.  I was more surprised by all the feature options that came with it.  The rental we has power lock door locks.  Once you fire the ignition, all the locks get in place.  This is some great level of safety for your kids! I imagine that you probably do this too.  When your kids are crying, you put them in the car and drive them around the block.  I did so on a few occasions with my son.  His broken leg was bothering him. <i> Never once did I have to put the headlamps on</i>. They were automatic.  The 2000 LS did it all for me.  It is a huge change from my own Jeep.  The 2000 Regal comes with <b>cruise control, tilt of the steering column</b>.

It is my observation that my wife particularly loved all the storage that the car provides.  She had lots of space to place the kids' CDs.  Most importantly, she enjoyed the radio controls that are on the steering wheel.  After all, it makes sense.  Since your hands must be on the steering wheel, what a convenience to use them to check the channels you want!  She could change the volume and skip to the next track of the CD.

If you don't or can't afford to go a step up, this Regal will do wonders for your driving needs.  You can always check the Sabre.  It is such a smooth vehicle to drive too.  The Regal is equipped with traction control that uses engine modulation.  It has a great appearance.  It also has some great design lines.  No wonder that Tiger Woods is advertising Buick!  To tell you the truth, I can openly associate this Regal with anything that is hip, reliable, convenient, and comfortable.  It did the job for my wife.  Never once did we have any problems putting all the car seats, getting our son with a broken leg inside.  By the way, the Regal LS comes with leather seats that invite you to just sit in.  

Imagine my frustration with the first nights when the ceiling and door lights would stay on a few minutes after we locked the vehicle.  I went back to check whether the interior lights were still on.  They were.  I soon realized that I did not have to turn them off.  They will take care of themselves.  Wow, no more worry about battery depletion!

Which color will you choose?  We decided to rent a burgundy 2000 Regal LS.  Yes, there were a few head-turners around.  Should I add that the car comes with a slight manufacturer's tinting of the windshield?  I recommend it to you, parents.<br><br>
