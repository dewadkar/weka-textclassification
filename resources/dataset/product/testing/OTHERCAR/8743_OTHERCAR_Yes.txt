            Simply put this is a truly outstanding car.  I bought my 94' LS Sedan about 5 years ago with 32,000 mile on it.  I now have 97,000 and still love getting in this car everyday. I have had virtually no mechanical problems and the car still runs like new and is as tight as the day I bought it. Every so often I venture out to look for a new car and then come to the same conclusion every time, I simply cannot find any car (short of spending 40K+) that I like any better than my Legend.  The combination of the roominess of a family sedan with the sportiness, speed and handling of a sports car that the Legend offers can't be beat.  I've looked at the RL and it just doesn't have that "glued to the road" solid feel of the Legend and the TL is just a cheaper feeling car.  If Acura still made a car that had all of the qualities of the Legend I'd buy it, but they just don't.  My only complaint is that my car is starting to show some signs of age, such as slight paint fading, minor cracking in the wood trim and most bothersome, the leather on the back seat has cracked open.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for a truly one of a kind great car at an inexpensive price look no further than the Acura Legend.  Oh ya, the LS also has a awesome Bose Premium sound system that will spoil you for all other car audio systems.
