            For about 5 years now I have been dreaming on getting a Dodge Viper GTS-R!  Now that's power!!!!  If I add a turbo to the V-10 engine the drives the beast then I will be away laughing.

Now I have seen the new Viper, I want one even more!  It literally looks like a dream car!!  A car you would only find in your dreams!  The silver one will do nicely in my garage.  Maybe a black one just to go to the shops and post letters.

But even though this is a car to die for, the price tag is a little concerning.  Why the hell is it only just under $70,000?  I thought at first that this was a miss-print, and then I just passed it over as being a very good deal.  But I was wrong!

There have been rumors and now close examinations on super-cars to back them up.  The Viper, along with other fast sports cars, isn't as good as we first thought.  Quite sad for me to hear.  Actually, I was devastated!  How could a Viper, the greatest piece of machinery in history, be passed off as just another sports car?  I don't know about this new Viper, but the GTS-R hauled ass going from 0 - 60 mph at a stunning 4.3 seconds!  That's one fast snake!

Maybe the new Viper isn't as good as the last, considering the fact that the newer the car these days, the less it will last.  OK, so Dodge isn't Jap, but they are still using the new cheap materials they claim to be steel.  How can a beast be worth only $69,000?  I could buy a gold Rolex watch for that!

Anyway, even though the new Viper is said to be not-so-good quality as first thought, it still looks like it fell from Heaven!  This car is and always will be the number 1 dream car to me.  Just look at it!  It is beautiful!  A true work of art.
