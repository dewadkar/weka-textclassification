            With the corvette derived LT-1 and relatively firm spring rates, the 1995 Fleetwood is an excellent car for city or highway driving.  Fuel economy is actually excellent on travel via interstate, and I have averaged well over 25 miles per gallon in this heavy auto.  I, like many others, prefer the handling characteristics of rear wheel drive, another positive factor for the Fleetwood.  Interestingly enough, after decades of front wheel drive and no rear wheel drive car for Cadillac since the 1996 Fleetwood, the new platform for the passenger cars will feature all rear wheel drive the in years ahead.

Many list the size (225 inches overall in length) as a drawback.  However, as a tall person with no desire for a truck with two door or a truck with four doors (SUV) this is the perfect car.  From the Ford Excursion on down in size, no SUV intimidates the Fleetwood.  Interesting, it has ground clearance of approximately 5 inches, remarkable for a passenger car.

The obvious benefits include all the standard Cadillac features including power seats w/ power lumbar and heaters, power windows, power heated outside mirrors that also fold in, automatic climate control and the list goes on.  

My father routinely borrows this car and leaves me with his 99 Eldorado if he is driving out of state, because the car is such a pleasure on a long road trip.  He considers the car too big for in town driving.

My only complaints are: (1) Difficulty in seeing out the rear of the car, but given the formal roof line and rear window this is a given.  Actually, once you are used to using the large outside rearview mirrors you can navigate quite safely, and (2) the electronic limiter prevents the car from going faster than 107-109.  With the corvette engine clearly able to generate speed, the car is willing to go and go, until the computer stops the fuel and the joyride ends.
