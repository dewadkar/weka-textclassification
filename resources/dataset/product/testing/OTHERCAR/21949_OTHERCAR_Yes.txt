            I own a 1988 Plymouth Colt Vista but for some reason there is no 1988 available to comment on?  This car is incredible.  It can seat seven people, it can hold 1185lbs of cargo and passengers, it fits in narrow "compact car only" spaces, has a place for everything and anything, and it's easy to maneuver and park and drive because of it's size and skinny tires.  All this and I have been averaging 27mpg over the last 5,000 miles.  The car has 150,300 on it today and the only way it shows its age is by the oil burning.  Mitsubishi engines have a reputation for oil burning, most notably the 3.0 liter V6 in Chrysler products and the Diamante sedan.  This is the 2.0 liter four which is also found in some Eclipses and Galants.  It uses about a quart of oil every 200 miles at 150K.  I am sure a rebuild would help but parts for this car are expensive.  Maybe a used engine would do better, but most likely a Mitsubishi engine in a junkyard car is what sent the car to the yard in the first place.  I like everything on the dash except the radio placement is too low.  A remote control and a Sony head unit solved that problem.  There are five storage bins in the car.  One map pocket in each front door, a sliding shelf under the front passenger seat, and two gloveboxes, a small one up high for gloves and small books and cassettes, and a large one down low for larger books and things.  You sit up high, not as high as a minivan, but at least you're not in a bathtub like in the smaller station wagons.  The 5-speed manual shifts very precisely, I never miss a gear, and the hydraulic clutch is light even in hot and heavy traffic.  The car can idle in 1st gear at about 3mph.  This is great for traffic but really makes me think the mileage could be better with taller gearing.  The car can go 75mph without complaint and the brakes are excellent.  Even loaded with four people and cargo, it drives great although it is slow.  But the 96 horsepower is fine with just me and some small packages.  The hood flips forward instead of back so it won't smash the windshield if you forget to close it tight.  All in all, I would absolutely buy another and this time I'll get one with air conditioning.  These were made from 1984 to 1991 and some even had four-wheel drive!  Must be nice in the Rockies and the Snow Belt areas.
