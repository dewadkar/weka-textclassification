            My mother owns a 1999 Saturn SC2 "special edition". She got the car in 1999 after owning a volvo. This is a very nice looking car, very sporty, dark blue looks great. Plastic exterior makes the car very durable. The power is good for an engine as small as its. However, this is not a sports car by any means. I believe they only have a little over 100 bHP. From what I understand, they are very safe. They were built on a Volvo Chassis. The car now has 53,000miles on it, and has held up very well. With regular maintenance, and not putting off any needed repairs, this car should last a long time. 
This car lacks in several areas. The roominess is very poor. The back seat is good for a 2 year old at best. The front seat is also not very comfy. Seats are stiff, and short, they do not slide back far enough. Placment of instruments is nice looking, but because of the lack of room, its hard to reach comfortable...not because its a long reach, because its such a short reach. I am only 5'10", and I have problems sitting in it. Now, my mom is 5'2", so its fine for her. The main problem with these cars is their visibility. I have never been in a car with such poor visibility. Because of the cars "smallness" its hard to look to either side when changing lanes. The high back makes parrellel parking or backing up almost impossible. The slant of the windsheild makes you feel like the glass is ending at your forehead. Its hard to watch the road properly with this almost horizontal windshield design. One of the worst things is it resale value. In only 2 years, the car went from $23,000 to $9,900. If you plan on driving it forever, its a good car, as far as resale value goes. If you just want a car for a few years, DO NOT get it.
