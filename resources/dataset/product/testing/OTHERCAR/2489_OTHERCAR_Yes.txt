            I bought my 1995 hyundai elantra gls in 2001 and I absolutely fell in love with it on the lot. I needed a car really bad and this one seemed perfect.  I did have some problems with it and they were all minor.  The major problem is finding someone who knows how to fix it.  I had an electrical problem that nobody could find.  The first problem was I kept burning alternators and alternator belts.  I took it to tons of shops and everyone gave me a different diagnosis and *FIXED* the problem.. Yet nobody really *FIXED* the problem.. I finally took it to someone who said my alternator was the wrong one for the car. I guess when I bought it the person who owned it before me had the wrong one..If thats possible. Anyways, i got it fixed and it is fine now.. Then i had a problem where i lost all power to everything.. My sunroof, my lights, my brake lights etc. The only power thing that worked was my windows and turn signals.. I took it everywhere again and yet again nobody knew what was wrong... FINALLY i took it to a small no name shop and the guy figured out in 5 minutes that it was a eyelet on my battery terminal that was bad.  I got it fixed and it is fine now.. HOWEVER.. i still have a tranny problem.. I think it is a sensor because everything else has been electrical..  I am going to get it repaired soon. But even with the problems i have (which i believe is due to the previous owner not taking care of the car) I wouldn't get rid of this car for the world.  This car is so quick.. looks great.. and everyone LOVES it!  It has all the accessories and accelerates like WHOA!! I LOVE MY HYUNDAI and i will have it for a while, even if i buy a new car!
