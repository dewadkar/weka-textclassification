            We ordered a 2000 from factory, I like the lights that automatically come on and reminds you to cut them off when you shut off the ignition.

The $500 dollars rebate and the road assistance until the end of the car's warranty.

The v6 cylinder car we purchased, provided a smooth and quiet ride.  The car is roomy and we particularly liked the fold down seats.  Our Alero is a 4-door sedan with the sports package, sunroof, 100 watt speakers(?)answer: teen and young adult input.

What I dislike, the unprofessional and childish actions of the auto dealer where I purchased my car, Jack Schmidt of O'Fallon, IL.  Gas miles, I am use to a 4 cylinder putt putt.

I believe the car is for the young, old and families depends on how you dress it up or down.<br><br>
