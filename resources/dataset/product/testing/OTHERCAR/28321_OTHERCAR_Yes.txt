                  For Corvette lovers the fifth generation Corvette has got to be it! After owning a 71 LT-1 a 82 and a 94, the C5 is by far the roomiest, best driving Corvette we've had. All Corvettes as far as I'm concerned are works of art, and are worthy of the time that there owners put into them waxing maintaining and most importantly driving them. I did not come here to bash other Corvette generations, rather to talk about the fifth generation.      Every vette we've had I have loved. But the 98 that we just purchased is really something special. I find it hard to believe that this car is an American made sports car. I just assumed that owning a vette meant putting up with a rough riding noisy leaky car. That is not the case with the C5, at least not yet. Every generation seems to have certain things that drive there owners nuts. But so far I cannot find anything about the C5 to complain about.      The leg room in the car is unheard of in a vette.The ride is another. I thought our 94 rode good for a vette, but the C5 rides good for any car. The noise factor  with all the air leaks squeaks and squawks of previous vettes is not a factor. Performance and handling is pure Corvette. And this car is a great value for a world class   sports car.       To sum things up. I don't think you can find another car on the market, that offers what the C5 offers for the price. In the long history of the Corvette I think the C5 will go down as one of the best ever.  <br><br>
