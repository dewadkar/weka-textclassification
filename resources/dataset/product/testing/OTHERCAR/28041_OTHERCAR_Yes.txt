            My parents bought me a 2000 Plymouth Neon as a safe, reliable car for college to get me between home and school.  I received the car as a gift in October 1999 and I have LOVED it ever since.  It is safe, roomy, peppy, and so sporty for a passenger vehicle.  As a 19-year-old, college girl, I needed a car that I could haul my friends around in, that would look good, and would have plenty of room to haul my college stuff to and from school.  This car is definitely a great car for all of the above reasons.  It also comes in GREAT colors!  I have a silver neon and get constant compliments on the attractiveness of my car and also how sporty it is compared to the older style neons.

I have had my share of problems, however, with this wonderful car.  When it was 3 months old, I went out to start it and it would not do anything.  It turned out to be just a bad cell in the battery, however, I got the &quot;You-are-a-young-teenager-who-left-her-lights-on&quot; look though, but it really was the battery.  Then a month ago, there was a part recall on the neons for the engine because there was a part that could freeze up and the car could supposedly just stall or stop and could cause wrecks, so I had to get that fixed.  Then a week ago, I had to get a new steering unit due to a problem with the distribution of power steering fluid not going to the right places.  However, they have not been life threatening problems.

This vehicle drives really nice and smooth.  It is also a lot more peppy than I expected too.  A light touch on the gas pedal send this little baby zooming!  It is delightful to drive, especially long distance because it is so quiet and smooth.

This car is perfect for the driver just starting out or a family car.  It offers a lot more room than expected and has a lot of trunk space.

I would not recommend this car for people that have to have a FAST, PACE car and think that V-6 engines are the only REAL engine to have.  The neons are fast and peppy, but not a V-6.  C'est la vie...<br><br>
