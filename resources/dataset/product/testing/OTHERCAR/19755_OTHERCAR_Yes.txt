            I got my 98 Mazda 626 in August of 1996.  I have driven this car across many states, over and over!  I've travelled between Nevada, Wyoming, Texas and Louisiana multiple times.  All I have had to do is routine oil, and air filter changes.  One thing to note is this car is NOT easy to get unlocked if you forget your keys!  The first time this happened it took the locksmith over 45 minutes to get it open... so if you're harried and hurried all the time, beware!  I love my Mazda because it has enough room for my three kids and I to be comfortable while traveling long distances, yet I don't feel like an old fuddy duddy driving it.  This car handles, looks and feels absolutely wonderful!  You will not regret purchasing one!<br><br>
