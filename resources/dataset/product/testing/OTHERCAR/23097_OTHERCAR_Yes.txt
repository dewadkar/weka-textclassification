            The price was a great buy.  I have had this camera for about a year, and well I could not be happier.  I did have a Sony digital camera before,and the quality just was not that great.  Now that does not mean that Sony is bad, it was just one of those camera's that was not that great.
The quality of the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 is really great.  I live the option of choosing what quality I want for each picture, and the memory card, which I purchased a new one, and now I can store even more pictures when I am away from my computer.
The software for downloading pictures is really easy, and also comes with editing features.  I really enjoy using this camera, and all my friends that see me using it, all want one too.<br><br>
