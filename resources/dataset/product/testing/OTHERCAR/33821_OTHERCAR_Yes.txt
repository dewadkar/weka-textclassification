            I purchased the Canon A-50 digital camera around 2 months ago. Since then I've made extensive use of the camera and most of its features. I also purchased a HP Photosmart printer which produces photographic quality output representative of the cameras ability.

I put off purchasing a digital until something small, rugged and feature rich was available. Friends had been purchasing the latest and greatest for the previous six months and showing me the features and the receipts, which were often quite high.

The Canon A-50 stores around 40 high resolution images on one of it's 8mb flash cards. The Camera comes with a cable adapter for the PC and Macintosh which makes upload to the computer seamless. The software that is provided is quite weak by contrast with the camera. The camera also has composite video out for viewing on Video.

Cool Features: The camera has a great UI and if you're intuitive you don't have to spend more than a couple minutes with the manual. You can browse, delete and time-stamp/name your images. You can view thumbnails of groups of images for preview. One of the best features is the panorama feature which lets you digitally line up the images for your panoramic shots.

The camera has an easy to use flash, timer and auto off to conserve on the battery. The battery is a standard lithium camera battery which is rechargeable, but requires a charger, which are expensive. The battery charge lasts less than an hour with the viewer on.

The image quality seems excellent. I've read technical descriptions of the quality of this cameras digital optics and they are rated excellent for a consumer model camera. I'm not a camera geek so I trust what I'd read, but camera geeks can't rely on this review for those details.

The best part is the price, which via mail order on Yahoo! Shopping was $420. For the price this camera had everything I could want. 

The bottom line is that I never have to buy film, pay for development and can print 8.5 * 11 for .70 each. I recently photographed my cousin and his daughter in Yosemite. Once at home I printed the image with a caption and gave it to my uncle. The quality of the print was astounding and my family was amazed at what was possible with the camera and printer. <br><br>
