             On November 6, 1996 I purchased a 1997 Pontiac Firebird.  I loved this car.  I traded in a 1991 Firebird on this car.  I had liked my older firebird so I thought I would like the newer model. I was right.  
 My bird as I call it was red.  It had T-tops with gray interior. It had a  6 Cylinder, 3.8 Liter, 200 Horsepower Engine. My bird drove like a dream. That baby could hug a curve.  (Getting teary eyed thinking about her)
 I have been using the past tense because I don't have my bird anymore. January 1998 I had my daughter.  Our first time in my bird did not go so well.  The back seat would not hold her carseat too well. I traded my bird in for a chevy lumina which was a little more suitable for a carseat.
 I like my lumina, but I miss my bird. 
 On the day I bought my bird the salesman took my picture with the car and made it into a calender.  Even though the calender is outdated I still have it on my wall.
 I have made a decision though.  On my daughters first day of school if Pontiac still makes firebirds, I am buying a brand new on that day.  My trust in firebirds is that good.
 Anyone who wants a nice sportscar, but does not have to depend on the backseat for anything should buy this car.<br><br>
