            This car was a company car for me.  I took delivery on it in May of '99, and I kept it for a year.  I drove it for 30,000 miles.  During that time period, the car was in the shop seven times for the brakes.  The brakes would work fine for one to three thousand miles, and then the rotors would warp and the pedal/steering wheel would vibrate badly.  Chevy customer service said &quot;they all do that&quot;.  Chevy blamed the problem on the new non asbestos brake pads.  Chevy said all cars, not just Malibus, not just Chevys, must use these brake pads, and therefore, all new cars have this problem.  My company used to buy 40 Malibus a quarter from Chevy.  We no longer do this, as the problems were obscene.

Other than the brakes, the car is fine.  I nearly purchased it from my company to use as a personal car.  The engine, while slightly loud (not the pushrod design is not as refined or quiet as the Japanese sixes) is powerful and torquey.  The transmission (4 spd. automatic) was excellent, maybe the best I've ever owned.  The seat were comfortable, if not overly supportive, and the car's structure remained tight as a drum for my entire ownership.

The car's ergonomics and the stereo were also top notch--Japanese quality.

The car handled well, but the steering was numb.

The body resisted dents and dings, and the paint and interior fabrics were resiliant.

This is a very affordable car, available to the public for much less than sticker due to GM's typical deep discounting.  This is horrible for resale value (sticker on my car $18600--trade in value after 30K: $9300).

If you want a car that is an appliance, the sort of car you can drive a thousand times and still forget what it's like, the Malibu is your sort of car.  I drove the Malibu back to back with a Camry, and I couldn't understand why anyone would pay sticker for a Camry, when you can get the Malibu for so much less.  I say this even taking the brake problem into consideration.<br><br>
