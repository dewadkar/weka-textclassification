            I leased an Isuzu Rodeo for my wife (previously leased a Ford Explorer).  She was taken by the sun roof and the sparking green paint.  The spare tire mounted on the rear door added a rugged look.

I went for the price (affordable) and was (still am) favorably impressed with the power and pep of the V-6 power plant (much better than the Ford SUV).

That's about all of the pluses I came up with on this particular vehicle.

The minuses:
A constant rattle from somewhere in the back (Is it the rugged looking spare tire?  The dealership can't find the source!)

Fuel consumption is similar to driving a tank (very high consumption rate = poor mileage).  And that description goes well for the lack of comfort this Isuzu delivers.  You feel every bump and crack in the pavement. (Comparatively, the Explorer was a luxury vehicle with a lot more features, than this thing).

There is a very annoying vibration upon acceleration.  It also delivers a very noticeable noise to bystanders outside the vehicle when my wife pulls out of the driveway.

The driver's door has a habit of not shutting completely without being really slammed hard.  The result of this door being ajar is a dead battery (on numerous occasions) because the dome light remains on when the door is not closed tightly.

And the worst part is we still have two more years on the lease!  I think I'll go back to the Ford next go round.<br><br>
