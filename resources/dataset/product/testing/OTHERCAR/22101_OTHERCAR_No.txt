            When I was in the market for a digital camera, two years ago now, I had researched a lot of different cameras, but the Kodak DC 215 stood out among the competition with its then excellent features and an overall great deal. Two years later, I am still a (semi)happy DC215 owner, but if you're thinking about getting this camera now, think again. Why, you may ask? Because at this point, this camera's features are outdated, and it is almost obsolete. Want the details?

-Kodak DC215 features a 1-megapixel CCD with a 2x optical zoom. While this was more than enough then, today's cameras far outgrow those specifications. But, if you aren't looking for that kind of precision, you MAY be satisfied by this camera.
-The zoom worked great, until I had a little accident with the camera, hit the lens against a table (not too hard, but enough to offset the focus for good).
-There are some major shortcomings about the quality of pictures in this camera. For example, action shots (ANY movement) shows up as a smear in the picture. Also, do not try to take any pictures at night of anything further than 6 feet from the camera, you just won't see anything.
-The connection to the computer is through a serial cable, and with the size of the pictures, it takes forever to link up to the camera and download the pictures. You'd be better off purchasing a Compactflash card reader, and use the USB connection
-The battery life of this camera is non-existent, if you use the LCD screen to preview/review your pictures. If so, expect about 5 minutes runtime from the 4 AA batteries that go into this thing. However, if you don't use the screen, you can get a decent amount of pictures taken without problems.

These are by far not all of the pros/cons of the camera, just the ones that are the most obvious to me as a 2-year owner of the unit. I have to say that I've taken tons of good pictures with it, but being a scrutinizing gadget-person, I'm annoyed with this camera's shortcomings, and looking to get something better down the road...If you find that this camera will do, buy it. But if you want fast downloads, long battery life, and high-quality pictures, stay away from this one!
