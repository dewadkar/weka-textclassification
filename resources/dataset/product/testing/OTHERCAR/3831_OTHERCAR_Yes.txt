            I have few complaints about the car itself - It handles well, has good pickup for a 4-cylinder SUV and has gotten me where I wanted to go everytime without any questions asked.  Don't bother with the front grille mask - It comes loose at high speeds and traps water on the hood, potentially leading to paint problems. Almost $400.00 at the dealership, but they are selling for less than $100 on ebay.  If you desperately want one, get it on ebay - At least you will be able to get close to your money's worth back when you realize that it is useless.

The window-mounted wind deflectors are great - I did run into a problem with the driver's side window's auto-close capability. The wind deflector is mounted within the window bracket making a tighter-than-normal fit when the window is raised.  The system interprets this resistance as a problem and lowers itself automatically to about halfway.  This problem is easily solved with a little lubricant in the window well every few months - no biggie, but a bit of a bother in the beginning.

Lots of nooks and cranies for storage is a nice touch in the main and rear cabin.
