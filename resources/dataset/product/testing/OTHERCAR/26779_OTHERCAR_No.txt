            Compact, car-based SUVs are the hottest segment of the market right now. Toyota and Honda have offered such vehicles for about five years now. The first generation RAV4 and CR-V weren&#146t quite right for the American market&#151Toyota and Honda didn&#146t originally intend to offer them here&#151but the second generation of each is much improved. Ford really blew the segment open last year with the Escape, which brought V6 power and a top SUV brand to the segment. Now GM is getting into the game with the VUE, offered by Saturn.

Saturn is a logical place for such a vehicle. The Japanese created this segment, and Saturn was created by GM to copy the Japanese, and especially Honda, as far as product was concerned. Think of the VUE as Saturn&#146s knock-off of the CR-V, and you won&#146t be far off. Still, there are a few significant differences between the two vehicles. I&#146ll cover these as I make my way through this review.

Note: Before the VUE was listed, I wrote a <b><a href="/content_51002707588">comparison</a></b> of the Escape, CR-V, and VUE that is listed under the 2002 Escape (click on the hyperlink to go there). That review focuses more equally on the three vehicles, such that it is even longer than this one.

<i>Update</i>: A second, more thorough test drive of a 2003 VUE has led me to significantly downgrade my evaluation of the vehicle. For the details behind this decision, see my review of the 2003 <b><a href="/content_78752157316">here</a></b>.

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

In styling, the VUE looks like a Saturn SUV might be expected to look: clean and friendly with a touch of quirky. Saturn stumbled when its designs got too plain in the late-90s, and it has learned from this experience. In the VUE, some character is provided by flared wheel openings, Audi-esque cutlines where the bumper fascias meet the body (okay, Olds and Saturn did this first, but it looks better on the A6), an upward sweeping indentation in the doors, and a hood that wraps over a bit into the fenders. 

The last warrants a bit more comment. Like the S-Series (small) Saturn, the VUE uses space frame construction. What this means is that the metal frame provides all of the structural strength of the vehicle, enabling the fenders and door skins to be made of plastic. (The larger, L-Series Saturns have plastic front fenders and door skins, but metal rear fenders that contribute to the structure.) On the plus side, these panels resist dents and won&#146t rust (not that vehicles rust much anymore, with today&#146s anti-corrosion technology). The downside of plastic panels is that they expand and contract quite a bit with temperature variations, so the gaps between them must be larger. Some reviews have criticized these gaps on the VUE, saying they allow fingers to be inserted up to the second knuckle. This has not been the case on the VUEs I have seen. The gaps are perhaps twice as broad as those on a Honda or Toyota, but they are much narrower than those I&#146ve seen on past Saturns, and very even. Now for that hood. The VUE&#146s designers appear to have incorporated wider than normal panel gaps into the design. The way the A-pillar and hood are styled accentuate these gaps rather than hide them, lending the product a hyper-functional, overtly structural character where each panel is clearly visible as a distinct part of the whole. I personally think it works. 

A few other features of the exterior design bear mention. The front end is perhaps the most car-like of any SUV, with very horizontal headlamps. Owing to these lamps, the VUE from the font looks like a car that has been given a serious suspension lift. The much more expensive Audi Allroad looks much the same way. Some people expect their SUVs to look more trucky, but then they&#146ll probably want other aspects of the vehicle to be more trucky as well. Think of this front end as truth in styling. The rear end is marked by blacked-out D-pillars, making it look as if the glass wraps around from one side all the way around the back to the other. The original CR-V was similarly styled in this area. That the new one has painted D-pillars, like just about every other SUV, suggests that Honda learned that SUV buyers desire the more rugged, stronger look of painted pillars. Though other features of the VUE&#146s styling may be quirkier, this one may cause Saturn the most heartache.

Some people will not like this or that detail of the design, but Saturn learned the hard way that overly safe designs make its vehicles too similar to everything else, and thus invisible to many potential buyers. Overall, I think they did a good job. The VUE is unique, it looks like a Saturn, and above all it looks both fun and sophisticated. Though about the same size as the CR-V, the VUE has more presence and generally looks much less like a toy SUV. I say cut Saturn some slack and be thankful it&#146s not a blatant copy of the CR-V or Escape. 

The VUE&#146s interior styling is more conventional. The gauges and switches generally come from other Saturns. Overall, they look and function well. Some people will object to the power window controls&#146 location near the shifter, but I don&#146t mind it. The basic design of the dash resembles the Lexus RX 300, with the shifter mounted on a shelf that protrudes from the center of the dash. Lower down, on the floor between the seats, Saturn has included a low, non-movable center console with a smallish storage compartment and cupholders. The last might be too low to be used easily. I suspect it&#146s low to attempt to mimic the open feeling in the front seat of the CR-V. Unfortunately, the promontory on which the shifter is mounted kills that effect. I don&#146t mind the sportier ambiance this design lends myself, but there is something to be said from the much more spacious feeling of the CR-V, with its column-mounted shifter, dash-mounted parking brake, and fold-away console. A significant difference to keep in mind, either way.

My least favorite part of the interior design is the door panels. The rear half of these, like the center console, is made of hard plastic with a pebbled surface texture. It looks and feels cheap. The padded door panels and armrests of the Saturn L-series are much missed here. 

Overall, the VUE&#146s interior is more stylish than those in the CR-V and Escape, but the quality of some materials takes away from this potential bonus. The higher quality materials in the CR-V reinforce its utilitarian aesthetic, recalling older Mercedes. Though the materials in the Escape may be even a notch below those in the Saturn, they are somehow seem less out of place in the Escape&#146s more utilitarian interior design. Redesigning the door panels and center console would help the VUE a great deal.

I have already mentioned that the CR-V&#146s interior feels more spacious. This is partly due to its design, but also because it is more spacious. Though the VUE is three inches longer and an inch wider than the Honda, it has 6% less passenger volume. Most notably, it has an inch less shoulder room (more significant than it would seem) and a whopping three inches less rear legroom (front legroom is virtually identical). 

This last disadvantage may be the largest weakness of the VUE. The new CR-V has a very spacious, surprisingly comfortable rear seat. It&#146s not just that the Honda has 39.4 inches of rear legroom, which is big car territory. It also helps a great deal that the Honda&#146s rear seat cushion is mounted high off the floor, so it provides thigh support to adult males. The rear seat in the Escape is similarly high, such that it is also comfortable despite providing the same amount of legroom as the VUE on paper. The VUE&#146s rear seat, in contrast, is mounted fairly low, as is frequently the case in GM vehicles. As a result, it provides insufficient thigh support&#151adults closer to six feet than five will have a bit of that "knees in your throat" feeling. It does not help that the map pocket on the back of the driver&#146s seat bulges out, making contact with the shins of this 5ï¿½&#148 male. (There is a bit more room behind the passenger seat, which has a plastic back.)

Why didn&#146t Saturn mount the cushion higher? There is more than enough headroom, so that wasn&#146t the limiting factor it often is in sedans. It seems that they wanted to avoid the complexity and expense involved in having the rear seat cushion fold forward when the rear seatback is folded to enlarge the cargo area. In the Honda and Ford, to get a flat load floor the rear seat cushion, because of its height off the floor, must fold forward when the rear seatback does. I don&#146t know how much this costs. I do know its not an inconvenience in these vehicles because the cushions are linked to the seatbacks in such a way that only one step is necessary. Saturn should have done the same.

Front seat comfort is better. The seats are moderately firm, softer than those in the Honda but not too much so. Though lateral support is minimal, you sink in just enough to feel well-supported in regular driving. The front seats are fairly high up, and combined with a large amount of glass afford excellent visibility, especially forward. Some of the pillars are a bit thick, but none obtrusively so. As in the CR-V and uplevel Escape, a manual height adjustment is standard. Also as in the Honda but unlike the Ford, leather and a power seat are not available. Leather will be available next year. Saturn may be copying Honda a bit much here. Leather isn&#146t just for luxury cars anymore, as a company that offers it in its smallest car should know. The dealer can have leather installed, but many people want their upholstery to come from the factory.

Many people buy SUVs for their interior versatility. Here the VUE comes up a bit short, but not overly so. As in the Honda (and PT Cruiser, for that matter), the front passenger seatback folds forward to permit very large objects to be carried inside. One unique feature is a cargo organizer that folds out of the floor to form a box about one by three feet in size. It is a bit flimsy, but not nearly to the degree some other reviews have suggested. It should be more than up to the task of keeping small objects or a few grocery bags from rolling about the interior.

With the rear seatback up or down, there is a usable amount of cargo space. But there could be more. Though a bit smaller outside, the Honda provides about ten percent more cargo volume inside. Credit/blame goes largely to the location of the spare. The CR-V&#146s is mounted on the tailgate, while the VUE&#146s, like the Escape&#146s, is under the cargo floor. As a result, the cargo floor is lower in the CR-V, and a decent amount of additional storage is available beneath it. That fixed rear seat cushion also causes problems here for the VUE&#151the rear seat doesn&#146t quite fold flat, though I suspect a bit of weight on it might fix this by compressing the seat cushion. 

Many people will be more than willing to give up 10% of their cargo room in exchange for the advantages of having the spare inside. Though this means the spare cannot be full size, it stays cleaner there, and is less likely to rattle. It allows the vehicle to look more sleek and car-like. Perhaps most importantly, in a minor rear collision the spare won&#146t be pushed into the tailgate, causing hundreds of dollars of damage. This is a danger on the CR-V, and on the Toyota RAV4 as well, since the spare extends further rearward than the bumper. 

Sadly, Saturn has not gone all the way and constructed the rear bumper to car standards. Small SUVs tend to have weak rear bumpers, such that minor rear collisions result in much damage, and I note that only the front bumper of the VUE is rated to withstand a 5 MPH hit. The competition doesn&#146t do any better, and often does worse, but Saturn could have led here.

One final area where the VUE comes up a bit short is the tailgate. Like the Escape but unlike the Honda, it opens upward rather than to the side. Some people prefer one, some the other. Shorter people can have trouble closing upward opening tailgates, and taller people can hit their heads on them, but they do get more out of the way.  Neither is easy to open in a closed garage. That&#146s where a separately opening liftglass can help. Unfortunately, the VUE, unlike most of its competitors, does not offer this feature. Because it often preferable to open only the glass, many buyers will be disappointed by this omission. 

<b>On the Road</b>

One area where the VUE promises to trump the CR-V is on the road. Though the second generation CR-V has a larger, more powerful engine, it&#146s still a four cylinder. Some people, myself among them, would much rather have the more refined sounds and sensations of a six. Like the Escape but unlike the CR-V, the VUE is available with both a four and a six. Both engines are slightly modified versions of those in Saturn&#146s L-series cars. They bracket the CR-V&#146s engines in power. While the Honda&#146s four produces 160 horsepower, the VUE&#146s four produces 143 and the its six produces 180. 

Performance is not a simple function of horsepower. Transmissions also affect performance. Saturn provides two unique transmissions in this class. Instead of a conventional automatic, the four will soon be available with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). I have described such a transmission in detail in my A4 review. To cut to the chase here, a CVT permits an engine to be held at the power peak as the vehicle accelerates, such that it produces full power all the time rather than losing a great deal of power every time the transmission shifts and RPM consequently drop. Though the Saturn four makes 10% less power than the Honda&#146s, the CVT should compensate for this. Weight also affects performance, but since the two vehicles&#146 weights are almost identical, their acceleration should be close.  On the downside, holding the engine at a constant RPM feels a bit strange and could result in a great deal of noise unless the engine is very refined, which the Saturn&#146s is not. Since a CVT is not yet available for a test drive, this is all theoretical for now.

The six&#146s acceleration is aided by a five-speed automatic. The extra gear compared to the competition permits a shorter first gear, for quicker acceleration, and a taller top gear, for more relaxed and more economical highway cruising. Since I drove the six, I can go beyond theory in this case. In short, that extra gear is not enough to compensate for a 10% power deficit compared to the similarly hefty Escape. The six&#146s acceleration will be more than adequate for 90% of buyers, but for those that value acceleration above all else the Escape has a definite advantage. I don&#146t know why the Saturn&#146s six doesn&#146t make more power. It&#146s the same size as that in the Escape, and 180 horsepower is definitely on the low side for a 3.0 liter 24 valve V6. Saturn should be able to find at least 15 more horses here without resorting to premium fuel.

Too much should not be made of this disadvantage. For the great majority of buyers that care about more than 0-60, the VUE will offer an appealing balance. It&#146s six is significantly torquier in feel than the Honda four. Though far from silent, and fairly loud when pushed, it is much more refined sounding than the gruff six in the Escape. The Saturn&#146s six may not offer blistering acceleration, but it never sounds strained or rough. The engine is an Opel (GM of Europe) design, and its European origins are evident here. 

As far as economy goes, the numbers on the sticker were 19/25, short of the CR-V&#146s 22/26, but better than the Escape&#146s 18/24, and far better than conventional SUVs. Overall, economy should be comparable to a six-cylinder sedan.

The VUE&#146s four-wheel-drive system is very similar to that in the Honda. Usually power goes entirely to the front wheels, but if these slip some power is automatically diverted to the rear wheels. This occurs very quickly, and is transparent to the driver. Such a system is generally intended for slippery roads, not going off-road. I drove the VUE over roads with a bit of ice on them, and it performed well. The Escape has a bit of an advantage here. Left in &#147auto,&#148 the Escape&#146s system functions much like those in the Honda and Saturn. But a switch is provided to lock the system in all-wheel-drive, such that torque is split 50/50 between the front and rear, much like in the RAV4. This provides a little more off-road capability, and subtly affects handling. That said, the Escape like the others lacks a low range, and is generally not designed for off-road use.

Handling is a VUE strong suit. Much like the new CR-V, it feels solid and composed on the road. Partly due to higher steering effort, the VUE does feel less nimble than the CR-V. Unfortunately, the higher steering effort does not translate into more road feel. The VUE uses an innovative power steering system that gets its assist from an electric motor rather than an engine-driven hydraulic pump (which should aid fuel economy). While this system was a match for the best GM has to offer, and is not noticeably different than conventional power steering, it was not up to Honda standards in road feel. That said, many people, especially men, will prefer the higher effort for the somewhat European, higher performance feel it imparts. 

One clear advantage of the VUE also plays a role here: it rolls less in turns than the CR-V, and perhaps any other vehicle in this class. The taller Escape rolls quite a bit more, and generally feels less car-like.

Compared to the Escape, both the VUE and CR-V are significantly quieter and generally feel more refined. Like the CR-V and more so than the Escape, the VUE rides like a good sedan. The low amount of lean for an SUV does not come at the cost of a poor ride.

<b>Pricing</b>

Adjusted for options, the six costs $1,665 more than the four, about in line with what the Japanese charge for a six. This amount is fairly reasonable, but could be lower. In the Escape, the six costs $1,510&#151and that includes an automatic transmission, easily $800 on its own. I suspect that this difference is because Ford doesn&#146t intend to sell many Escapes with the four, while Saturn does. 

This cost difference filters through to the bottom line. The stickers are not too far apart: the Escape&#146s with similar equipment (the main difference being a power seat in the Ford) is about $200 less. But Saturns sell at sticker, while a thousand-dollar discount (or more) shouldn&#146t be hard to find on the Ford. 

Compared to the CR-V, the VUE may also have a hard time on price. Though in this case both should sell at sticker, the VUE with the four stickers for nearly a grand more than the CR-V, adjusted for equipment. Get the six, and you&#146re looking at $2,600 more than the Honda, a sizable chunk of change. 

<b>Last Words</b>

Though the prices could be a bit lower, the VUE has much to recommend it. It has unique, sophisticated styling. Its six is reasonably powerful and refined. Its steering is firm, and it rolls less than the competition in turns, yet it also rides comfortably. Visibility from the driver&#146s seat is very good, and the cargo area is fairly versatile. Perhaps more than any of these individual strengths, the combination of them is appealing. They add up to a more adult yet still fun vehicle than the competition. Overall, for many buyers I suspect these strengths will outweigh the VUE&#146s weaknesses, most notably the quality of some interior materials, insufficient room and thigh support in the rear seat, and the non-opening tailgate window. 

A final factor that will affect many decisions is the Saturn dealer experience.  Saturn dealers are well known for treating their customers well, even too well for those who find all the friendly overtures over the top. A more stress-free buying and owning experience cannot be found anywhere.
