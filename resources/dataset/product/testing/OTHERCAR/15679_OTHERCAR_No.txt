            ------- UPDATE 2002-07-14 -------
Well, it's been a lot longer with the car - 18 repairs in 18 months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  All covered under warranty, but it is outrageous to become a fixture in the Mercedes dealer's service area when spending this on a car.

We have decided to finally sever out love/hate relationship with the car and traded it in on a 2002 BMW 525i.  

We loved the C240, it's features, it's integration, everything.  We hated the reliability, the electronic glitches we encountered, etc.

We had intelli-aide replaced three times?  Drivers seat motor, sunroof tracks, driver side controller for all electronics (door mirror, seat, etc.), babysmart sensor, radio problems, etc.  Man, talk about a car that cost Mercedes more in warranty repairs than they got from us for purchase price.

The first year of the C redesign has been seen for what it is - an electronic gremlin - the techs working on the car confirmed our suspicions and told us that we were NOT the only 2001 C with these problems.... so if you see our old one on the used lot... don't walk away, run.

We have been told that the '02 is much better reliability wise on the electronic front, and there will be additional changes for the '03.

Anyway - I figured I had to update the review!!
------- UPDATE 2002-07-14 -------


My wife and I put down money months before Mercedes officially announced the new redesigned.  

We read every article in every magazine for months on the new model.

We waited and waited and waited and waited.  And finally we got a call saying that we should come down to pick out the model, colors, options, etc.

Model: C240 6 speed manual
Colors: Brilliant Silver w/charcoal interior
Options we got:
+ C1 Package
  �  10-way Power Front Seats 
  �  4-way Power Steering Column 
+ C2 Package 
  �  Power Tilt/Sliding Tinted Glass Sunroof 
  �  Rain-sensing Automatic Intermittent Windshield Wipers 
  �  Power Rear Window Sunshade 
+ C3 Package    
  �  60/40-spilt Folding Rear Seats 
  �  Ski Sack 
+ 10-speaker Bose Sound System 

but, we still didn't know the price for any of this!

Once we found out the base + option prices we added:
+ K2 Package 
  �  6-Disc CD Changer 
  �  Digital Motorola TIMEPORT Phone 
while it was still on the boat.

We took delivery on the evening of October 23rd, 2000.  We paid MSRP and were on our merry way.  (We live in the land of Microsoft - there isn't such a thing as a price negotiation on a brand new design Mercedes...)

Once we figured out the seats, the radio, etc. we headed out and I dropped off my car at home and my wife drove to dinner.  It was great.  The ride is pretty darn smooth, the cabin relatively quiet.

We figured out that when the cell phone package got added mid-shipment they didn't install the software upgrade to engage the steering wheel buttons.  So they zapped some new software into her and off we went with cell phone working just fine with the steering wheel buttons.

We also had to have the GPS antenna for intelli-aide regrounded.  These two visits for service in a brand new redesigned car is pretty darn good in my opinion.

The C240 is not a powerhouse but we didn't buy it for that.  (The car I've used as my daily for three years now is an '87 Ferrari 328 gts... I can get my power addiction treated there.)  If I read another person whine about the 240 being weak (compared to a 320) I'll scream... DUH?!?  Of course a 2.6 liter engine is less powerful than a 3.2 liter one (yes, it is a 2.6l in the 240... don't ask me why - I don't understand marketing!).  The 240 is exactly what I expect from it for power... go test drive one and if you don't like the power test out the 320 and if you don't like it don't buy it.

My only disappointments:
- the 320 doesn't come with a 6 speed - I would have gotten it that way if we could have
- the gas peddle feels very non-linear - makes it hard to heel-and-toe
- the brakes produce a ton of dust but they are very grippy so it's a small complaint
- when you remove the metal part of the key and give it to the valet - there is nothing for the valet to hang on a peg... very odd/poor design for a key that will be handed to a valet on a regular basis
- the brake is a bit mushy for my taste (remember - my daily is a Ferrari)

Things my wife and I love:
- higher level of quality than the 1996 BMW 328is
- The seats are COMFY (get the power seat option in the 240 - it's worth it... automatically places seats to each driver's position based on key)
- The radio is decent, the integration with cell phones, radio, cd, and tape is great - and all controllable from steering wheel
- speaker phone is very clear
- security of knowing help is only a touch away or automatic in the case of an accident
- sturdy construction - solid thunk to the door
- relatively zippy for a low/mid priced luxury sedan - good looking too
- pleasant overall experience - buying and service - it is SO NICE to have a great service department

Very, very big improvement over the last version of the C-class and worth every penny in my opinion.
