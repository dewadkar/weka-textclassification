            In April of 2000, I purchased a 'program vehicle' 1999 Sonata from a dealer for my wife. I then drove her 1994 Altima GXE (a superb automobile). The Sonata, however, had a great allure. I drove it, using every excuse. I solved my 'jealousy' by approaching the dealer with a request for another 1999 Sonata program car.  I sold the Altima for a good price, and bought a Sonata for me. I love this car! 

The Altima lacked driver seat adjustments, something that Hyundai has addressed. The ride is comfortable without sacrificing very good handling. The noise level is quite low. The mate of transmission and engine is superb (I have an automatic). When I purchased the Altima, I opted for a five speed, since the reviews indicated that the automatic was a poor match to the engine. 

This automobile may fall short of perfection, yet I find little to critique. The price /performance ratio is excellent. I have never purchased two nearly identical vehicles in my life, and certainly not within 90 days.  This car is that good (and I do my homework). I advise any buyer to at least test drive the Sonata. The revelation may be amazing. Eventualy, prices may climb to those of the established leaders in the category. In the meantime, take the opportunity to cash in a great deal for an excellent automobile.<br><br>
