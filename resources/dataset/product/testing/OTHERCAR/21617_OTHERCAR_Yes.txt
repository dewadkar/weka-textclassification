            I have had my 94 GC since it was brand new, and have racked up over 160,000 miles on it. The car still handles well, engine purrs, and I fully expect another 100K or better from it.

The vehicle has been a dream in Colorado winters and handles well in all road conditions (full time 4wd).  The V8 engine puts out more than enough power for our mountains and pulling light loads.  I don't do much off-road stuff.  I have friends with the V6 and the smaller transmission, and they seem power-starved- at least here at 7000 ft above sea level.  Even with this amount of mileage on the vehicle, very few sqeaks and rattles- the interior still looks new, and the exterior paint could be brand new, except for stone chips.  I am not real good about washing/vacuuming/waxing, but it has held up well.

A couple major problems- maybe this will save someone some money on repairs:

1. Transmission slippage- turns out my transmission was not built correctly.  It started slipping at 100K miles.  When my mechanic rebuilt it, it turned out that there were two friction plates together, and two steel plates together (they should be friction/steel pairs).  After a $1500 rebuild, no problems, in fact it works better now because it no longer has that annoying habit of shifting in and out of overdrive.

2.Power window stop working- check out the harness between the body and door- it seems to have been made out of cheap plastic.

3. Not long after I had the car, it would often blow main fuses when you started it, or got in, or whatever.  After much searching, an old mechanic found a wire for the power seat motor that was running through a seat spring.  When you would get in and sit down in just the right position, boom.


Other than than, it has been great.  I have done all the maintenance religously, and that seems to have paid off quite well.  I would be very careful about a used vehicle, because it seems that Jeeps which have not had the scheduled maintenance done are problem children.

Rotating the tires regularly (Goodyear AT) have given me 60K miles from each set-can not complain about that.

Also some issues with the internal electronics- bulbs burning out, that sort of stuff-  more of an annoyance than anything.

In short, despite few heartaches described, the vehicle remains a workhorse, and still feels good to drive.  I will buy another one when this one finally dies.  When all the costs for the vehicle are added up, it has been a relatively cheap means of transportation, and with a good feeling of safety and reliabilty, especially in Colorado winters.
