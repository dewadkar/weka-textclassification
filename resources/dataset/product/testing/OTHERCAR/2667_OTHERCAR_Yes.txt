            If you haven�t been paying attention to the mini-SUV market, you soon will. Land Rover�s venture into the baby-ute segment is just more evidence (as if we needed it) that this new style of vehicle is the current hot ticket. Toyota virtually invented the mini-SUV segment with the RAV4 more than six years ago, but could anyone have guessed that a sub-$30,000 Land Rover would result in 2002? 

Today�s mini-SUVs offer many of the benefits of their larger counterparts (versatility, rugged interior, high seating position) without the drawbacks (difficulty in parking, expensive, poor fuel economy). The Freelander is Land Rover�s attempt to roll all the best qualities of a Land Rover product into a small and affordable vehicle while still maintaining the high standards Land Rover has been know for. 

The Freelander S comes equipped with such features as Hill Descent Control, permanent all-wheel drive,  5-speed automatic transmission with sport shift feature and keyless entry. While the Freelander does offer ABS and Electronic Brake Ford Distribution, the rear brakes are still drum type. Available in three trim levels, S, SE and HSE the prices range from just under $25,000 to $31,000.

The Freelander is an OK looking vehicle. Many praise the bold and rugged look of black fender flares and bumpers, while other think that same treatment looks cheap. The Front looks unique if nothing else. The exterior styling seems to be part Honda CRV and part La Forza. There�s no denying this is a Land Rover and they want you, and passers-by to know it. The exterior is plastered with Land Rover logos. Let�s count them; one on each wheel = 5 including exposed rear spare. One logo on each C pillar = a total of 7 so far. The third brake light spells out Land Rover, plus another logo on the rear tailgate and the words Land Rover are also embossed on the rear bumper. Now we�re up to 10. Finally there is a logo up front on the grille, as well as the huge script across the hood. WOW! A grand total of 12 different places the words �Land Rover� appear on this vehicle. The word �Freelander� appears once on the rear. �Hey everyone, I�m driving a fancy car, not one of those run-of-the-mill, small SUVs.� Why don they just put that on each fender?

In many ways the Freelander is a success. The Freelander is roomy inside and yet still maintains somewhat meager exterior dimensions � a big plus if you can�t stomach the thought of trying to park an Expedition in the local mall parking lot at Christmas time. The Freelander also succeeds in value/price. A reasonable equipped Freelander S will set you back about $26,000. True, that�s no low-price leader but a similarly equipped Toyota RAV4 can also cost a little over $26,000. The RAV4 offers no V6 and is just not up to the same type of off-road duties the Freelander handles with ease.

While it�s true that the Freelander delivers adequate exterior room without huge exterior proportions, that fact is not readily evident from behind the wheel. The Freelander�s long hood and short rear overhang make it difficult to accurately judge where you are in relation to off-road obstacles as well as other cars when parking. Once we got out of the vehicle to check how close a parallel parked car was to the front or rear, we found that there was much more room available than it appeared from behind the wheel. After a week or so of driving, you learn to trust your instincts, but it can be a bit nerve racking at first.

On the road, the Freelander has a smoothness and a civility that come close to much more expensive SUVs such as the Lexus RX300. The cabin remains relatively quiet with only a little wind noise (from the big outside mirrors?) and some noise from the slightly aggressive, 16 inch Mud+Snow radials.  Mild off-road trails and rough roads are effectively soaked up by the Freelander�s four wheel independent suspension. Cornering is another matter altogether. Perhaps due to the Freelander�s off-road abilities, or perhaps due to something else completely, the Freelander leans in the corners a little more than we�d like. This is no sports car, and it�s not intended as such, but less body roll at low and moderate speeds would really improve the handling characteristics of the Freelander. Often, the steering response feels very slow or heavy. Come to think of it, the whole car feels heavy. Acceleration and braking are adequate, but this little Rover can�t shake an overall feeling of heaviness. That being said, the Freelander gains composure the harder it�s pressed, aggressive driving reveals a sure-footedness that an average driver would never guess is there. Calling it �fun� would be an over-statement, but certainly �competent� is a fair assessment.

This is typical of many luxury cars, a consumer is usually forced to choose between a soft luxurious ride and tight, sharp handling � the Freelander walks the line as best it can. The Lexus GS430 splits the difference very well as does the Mercury Mountaineer and Mazda Tribute. The opposite end of the spectrum would, again, be the Toyota RAV4 which is simply too jittery around town. If you value smoothness and a solid cabin over quick handling, the Freelander will not disappoint. 

Acceleration is adequate. The 174 hp V6 certainly seems willing, but somehow the Freelander never feels quite fast or quick enough. The 4-cam, 24-valve, 2.5L engine is not noisy or harsh and is pleasant during both around town driving and open highway touring. A little sluggish off the line, the DOHC engine really starts feeling its oats as the revs climb. The higher RPMs seem to be where most of the useable power is similar to other DOHC engines such as those in Honda products. You�ll never race to the head of the line with the Freelander, but you won�t get left on the shoulder when highway merging is required. 

From behind the wheel, the Freelander feels like a little Discovery � high and wide. The commanding view of the road is nice, but again, the Freelander has a tendency to feel bigger than it really is � �pro or con?� you�re asking. Well it seems to be a bit of both. 

Seats are comfortable for extended stints, and rear seat room is more than adequate for the average sized adult. Those over 6 ft. may find the back seats a little tight. Headroom is plentiful as is hip and shoulder room. While the Freelander S has a base price of $24,975, the 240 watt Harmon-Kardon upgraded audio system will add another $750 to the bill. It�s only barely worth the money, not because of sound quality � it sounds awesome, but because for the $750 you still have to make due with a single CD player rather than a multi-disc changer. Granted you do get nine speakers including a rear-mounted sub-woofer, but a CD changer would be nice for $750. Even in top of the line HSE trim, a CD changer is still an extra cost option according to the Land Rover web site.

Rear seats fold down in a 60/40 split. There is room for cargo, but the release for the folding rear seats is hard to reach if you�re reaching around from the rear door opening. This is a little inconvenient when needing to fold the seats down while already carrying the cargo. With the rear seats in the fully upright position, the cargo storage area is adequate, but by no means expansive. The lack of a retractable cargo cover is missed.

Ergonomics are a little on the quirky side, but  then again this is a British car.  Power window switches are located on the center console and the hood release is on the passenger�s side. There is a glove box on the driver�s side, and the rear tailgate opens toward the sidewalk. All this is a result of the Freelander being converted to left-hand drive. The tailgate is terribly inconvenient, but everything else can easily be seen as the type of thing that makes owning an English car fun � it�s a little different. 

Storage space abounds inside the Freelander. Door mounted cup holder expand to accommodate even the Big Gulp, and a dash mounted cup holder allow an extra two cups to be stored. In keeping with the rugged theme, the Freelander has rubber mats that virtually beg to have sandy or muddy shoes stomped on them. Various rubber trays are removable for easy washing. 

Additional storage can be found in the driver and passenger side glove boxes, as well as small netting on the roof in the rear seat area. Even with two pair of sunglasses, parking access cards, CD wallet, garage remote, water bottles, wallet, and spare change the easy to get to storage areas are but a third used up � other car makers take note: we like to carry stuff with us, and we like it to be easy to reach. The hard plastic surfaces found inside the Freelander seem like they belong in an old Cavalier, not a luxury SUV.

Overall, the Freelander is successful in its mission � offer those who might otherwise not be able to afford a Land Rover all that the name stands for in a scaled down package. It is by no means the perfect mini-SUV, but in S trim, it does offer adequate interior space, and a solid ride for the same price as a loaded Toyota RAV4. The Freelander�s drawbacks include heavy, numb steering, lack of muti-CD changer even when ordering  the upgraded stereo, drum brakes, and exterior proportions that are difficult to judge from the driver�s seat. Although the Freelander�s 2.5L V6 is relatively smooth, it could use a little more oomph in the lower RPMs. Pluses include comfortable and high seats, pleasant highway ride and off-road abilities car-based SUVs simply cannot match. 

There is something to be said for a car�s heritage or image, and Land Rover certainly has an image that brands like Nissan and Toyota don�t. We�re not saying this is worth paying any extra money for, but it is worth thinking about when other factors such as price and options are fairly equal. If you�re impressed by the Land Rover name, but are on a Toyota budget � the Freelander is just what you�ve been waiting for.

PS - I just started driving a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder and now I like the Freelander even MORE than when I first wrote this review. The Xterra is better in cargo space and horsepower - everything else about the Freelander makes it seem like a Rolls Royce compared to the awful, and crude Xterra.
