            I do not own a PT Cruiser, but there are several individuals where I live who have purchased one within the last six months.  The only auto dealer in town sells Dodge products, which helps if you live in Isleton, CA and want a PT Cruiser.  Also, the dealership, HR Dunn and Sons, has been there since 1922, so they sold cars like this the first time around. I also have not ridden or test-drove one, but from all appearances everybody seems to be really happy with their purchase.  The main reason I am writing is that since the PT Cruiser is reminiscent of something from the 1930s, I think certain features should either be standard or optional:

1)  Suicide doors.  The 1930s cars for the most part had them, in my opinion those should be really cool as a design feature.  After all, the PT Cruiser is a four-door.
2)  A literal rag-top.  Sunroofs are cool as it is, but if you want the 1930s essence of design, a roll-back rag top would be most ideal.  Unfortunately, interior noise can be excessive.
3)  Rumble seat.  The PT Cruiser's current design does not really allow for one, however.  Maybe the Prowler can be equipped with a rumble seat.  Cars of that era sometimes had rumble seats.

Other than that, the PT Cruiser is definitely visual eye candy. <br><br>
