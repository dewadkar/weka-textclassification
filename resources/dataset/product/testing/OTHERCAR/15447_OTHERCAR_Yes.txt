            I recently purchased this camera as my old digital camera was no longer cutting it at a max res of 640x480.  The pictures that FD88 takes are incredible.  With a max res of 1280x960 I can zoom in with my editing software and still get a clear picture.  The color is great and very crisp.  Also the problem that older Sony cameras had has been fixed.  This camera has three flash settings to get just the right amount of light.  It also has multiple settings to change the size and quality of your pictures.  not only can you choose between three resolutions (ranging from 640x480 to 1280x960), but you can also choose between standard and fine quality.  This gives you a variety of options that gives you the best mix between quality and disk space.  It has several preset programs for different situations including two low light settings and an evening setting.  It also has a macro setting which I have used to take fantastic pictures at less than an inch from the object.  The 8x/16x zoom allows you to get very close to far away objects (a friend and I were able to photograph a license plate on a car that was almost a block away and we were able to read all but the last digit of the tag number).  The quality of the digital zoom is great.  As if all this wasn't enough, it also includes MPEG video.  At the low resolution you can get about 60 seconds and about 15 seconds at the higher res.  The video isn't great and it's not going to replace your camcorder, but it is nice to get a few clips here and there and it does come in handy.  I wouldn't buy the camera for the MPEG capability, but it is a nice bonus.  While I still think that floppy disks make the Mavica cameras the most convenient ones on the market (you're only limited by the number of disks you can carry in your camera bag), there is a limitation as you only get about 4 pictures per disk at the highest res/quality.  Also, it only comes with the less expensive battery which lasts about an hour before it needs recharging.  You can purchase a battery that lasts about twice as long for around $60.  All in all, I am thrilled with this camera and would highly recommend it.

One other thing:  the camera takes regular 37mm filters and adapters, so you are better off going to a camera store for accessories as things are probably about 2 to 3 times more expensive direct from Sony.<br><br>
