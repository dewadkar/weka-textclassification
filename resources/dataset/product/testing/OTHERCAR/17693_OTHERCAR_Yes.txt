            I bought my Saturn used back in 1998.  It had only had one owner before and it had low mileage.  The car is much cheaper at the gas station compared to almost every other car out there because it takes less money to fill this car's whole gas tank up.  It's comfortable and I realized that Saturn cars can take a few bumps and not even show any damage besides a few scrapes.  I've went to get a few things on the car changed since I got it.  I got new tires, I got a CD player installed, added tints, had coolant, fuel injectors and oil changed before.  Replaced some spark plugs and got a new fuel filter.  I also had the emergency brake line replaced after I got it caught on some construction and it stretched out.  

These type of things can be expected (pretty much) on a Saturn that is over 5 years old now.  I bought this vehicle because it was right for what I was looking for.  A small car with good mileage, 4 doors and not too expensive.  I have been able to get through some close calls on the road that I wouldn't have been able to get though with a bigger, heavier car.  There are a few steering options, and there is all of the basics you could ask for on a car.  

Much of the car is made of plastic but the doors were made to be very durable in case of accidents.  It's very easy to drive this vehicle and the car never makes me feel uncomfortable driving it.  I feel like I have full control over the car when I am driving it.  I say this car is for people that are looking for an affordable, safe car that is not over fancy.  If you are looking for something to impress people with when you go down the street this car won't exactly do that.  But it will get you where you need to go.<br><br>
