            My brother's first truck when he was 18 (which would have made me 16) was a '76 Chevy Blazer.  It was full time 4 wheel drive and could go through just about anything any time it wanted to.  But the problem was that since it was so old, it wasn't really made to drive to Plant City (about 200 miles from here) at 90 mph the whole way, and it threw a rod and blew up the engine.

Why am I telling you this, you may ask?  Why should you care?  I am not sure, but you are still reading, so you must be at the very least SLIGHTLY interested in how this all ties in to the Toyota truck.

Well, it doesn't.  I just wanted you to know that a Chevy Blazer won't drive 200 miles at 90 mph.  Wasn't that a good moral to the story?

Anyways, now that you think I am a total moron, let me continue.  Since the engine blew up, and he had NO money saved, he took the money he got for the truck from the junk yard (it had brand new mudding tires on it, so they bought it for the tires) and put it as a down payment on a brand new 92 Toyota Pickup.  That is how it all tied in, so do you feel better knowing that?

Well, naturally the first thing I wanted to do with the truck was take it out to the woods and see if we could bury it in at least four feet of mud, but since it was a new truck, he didn't want to mess it up (like a truck was ever made to stay looking pretty!) and he wouldn't go mudding with the guys.

Well, one night, I decided that I couldn't stand it any more, and I asked him if I could use his truck to go mudding.  OK, so it was like 3 am and he was fast asleep, and although he CLAIMS he was just snoring, I could swear that I heard him say &quot;Go Ahead, Jeff, I trust you.&quot;  But that is irrelevant, he was just mad that I had fun and he didn't and now he has to lie and say he can't carry on a somewhat intelligent conversation with me while he is sleeping.  Like I believe that.

But anyway, yeah, the truck.  Let's just say that within the course of two hours (hadda have it back before Dan got up for work...I still am not sure if I really believed he wouldn't notice the mud...) I put it through three flag ponds, a canal (that one was impressive, actually, but the water was only like 4 feet deep where I slid into the canal...) and more mud than I have ever seen in my life since then.  The amazing thing is that I never got stuck, and I didn't break anything.

To make a long story even longer (or shorter?  yeah, longer), I got home like 10 minutes before he woke up, got in bed all muddy (can't risk him hearing me in the shower, because then he would know it was me and not think that the truck got itself muddy), and pretended to be asleep.  Well, needless to say, he didn't buy it, and if I had taken a shower I am quite sure I would have gotten away with it, but I didn't.

Anyways, he still has that truck 8 yars later, and it still runs like a champ.  He has over 120K miles on it, it has been from Florida to New York at least three times that I know of, and we have since put it through beatings that would make Rodney King feel lucky.  Definitely one to recommend to friends.<br><br>
