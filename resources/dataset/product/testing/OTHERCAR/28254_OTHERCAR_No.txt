            The Dodge Durango is a one of the better SUV's out there today. It has an aggressive styling that is 
very attractive to both men and women. And the power is definitely there when you need it. What is different 
about the Durango is the feel of security on the road. I've test driven almost every SUV out there, and 
the Durango get's the vote for that ''big truck'' feeling. You feel confident in it's capabilities. But the comp-
plaint's seem to outweigh my compliments. First, it is a gas guzzler, I enjoy alot of power in my vehicles so
I can sacrifice economy. For the practical money-saver, unless you enjoy off-road adventures every weekend
skip this one. Next, I would have to mention styling. The interior is ugly and uncomfortable, you know,
truck like. I believe, especially for women sitting in the passenger seat, that a softer more plush interior
would be benificial. And the rear seating, well, forget adults 6 ft. tall, headroom is terrible. I seem to find
that the only SUV with good headroom was the Grand Cherokee. But it was built to have more headroom and
seat less people than the Durango. In my area of the country the Durango SLT with leather interior and all 
the goodies sells for around $35,000. Alot cheaper than the Grand Cherokee Limited at around $38,000.
   Overall, the SUV wars are fighting and have been for years. The Durango is definitely a top competitor
in this battle. Either way, I didn't really enjoy the 4-Runner or the Blazer. They were the last vehicles I would
recommend to anyone. And most of the SUV's I drove were overpriced for what seems to be regular options
on most vehicles today. Well, at least manufacturers have finally decided to bring back the full size spare
tire. 
     The Durango was the most powerful of the SUV's I have driven. If gas mileage is enough of a sacrifice 
go for it. My recommendation is this, test drive one, examine the room it has to offer. Next, get your seat and mirrors adjusted, load up the kids and drive 20 miles. If you have a backache afterwards, buy a JEEP.<br><br>
