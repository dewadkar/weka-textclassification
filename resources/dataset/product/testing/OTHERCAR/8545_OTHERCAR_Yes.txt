            Well this was the last hoorah for that boxy, traditional Jeep Cherokee that we've all grown accustomed to in our lives.  The 2001 model was the last in production as the Cherokee gives way to the brand new Jeep Liberty. 

I purchased my vehicle only a week ago so understand I'm going off of a brand new car with under 300 miles on it right now.  Here are my first impressions...most of which are good.  

I went to Carmax looking for a nice used SUV and test drove a 4Runner, Blazer, and Honda CR-V.  While we were trying to figure out monthly payments the salesman happened to tell me "you know I can get you a brand new Cherokee for what you'll be paying monthly for these used cars."  So I jumped on that and took it for a spin.  The first thing I noticed was that traditional (which I like) Cherokee frame that boxy SUV style that we've all grown to know and love.  Next thing I checked out was interior space.  Now I'm 6'2" and I found the front seats to be quite comfortable.  I am at comfortable arms/legs length to the steering wheel and gas pedal with enough room in the back to fit a shorter person.  Now when I tried to get in the back with my wife in the front it was TIGHT!  Let me tell you getting in is the most tricky part.  Because of the indentation where the rear wheels are you kinda have to squeeze in sideways to get in then once I was in my knees were crushing up against the front seat.  I could manage seeing as I'm young to sit in a very uncomfortable position.  Now if you are a family just getting starting like I am it is fine you have the wife and husband in the front and the back will sit a child fine.  Then we took it to the road.  

This was the Sport 2WD version and it was a step up for the Limited and another $1,500 or so and the only differences I noticed were that the Limited had leather, power seats, and heated seats.  So I figured I'd try the Sport out and it has pretty much everything you need inside.  Power windows, door locks, mirrors.  CD, cassette, am/fm radio w/10 presets.  Fog lamps, rear wiper with washer fluid, rear defrost. Everything I desired but I am much more easily satisfied then some people and to those I recommend the Grand Cherokee.  Then it was off to test drive this baby.  I was surprised on how well it handled.  The engine is a little loud and idles with some noise and when the a/c is on it really makes it that much more loud.  But the ride was smooth.  It drives like a truck but even when I hit 75 the ride is as smooth as if I were driving 35 or 40.  

Now I've heard some people that have had problems with the Jeep Cherokee.  But in my short time of owning it it's been a joy to drive.  I was driving a compact car and to now be driving the legendary Jeep Cherokee is quite a step up.  It drives like a truck like I said so people who don't want those truck problems i.e. the loud noises.  I wouldn't suggest this car.  It's a V6 engine so it will guzzle it's fair share of gas.  If you're looking for a SUV that handles like a car I recommend the Honda CR-V that "truck" is strictly made for people who need mini SUV size but will never use it off road.  It has a V4 cylinder and will save you on gas and it drives just like a car.  Very convenient if that's what you need it for.  I was looking for something with more power and something I could take off road if needed and let me tell you if that's what you need then look no further then this baby.  And if you have the money to step it up go for the Grand Cherokee both are wonderful.  Overall I really love this truck and not foreseeing any troubles in the future look forward to driving it for many years to come.
