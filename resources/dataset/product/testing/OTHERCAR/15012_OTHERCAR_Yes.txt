            Its so easy to use this Sony MVC-FD73. You simply throw a disk in, take up to 40 pictures per disk, then slide it into your computers disk drive. I've taken about 300 pictures using this camera. The color photos are very good. You don't even NEED a computer. You easily put a phone cord into the camera and use its email mode. And the best part: You can view your pictures right from the screen and delete them. Think of all of those horrible pictures you spend money to get developed. And also you don't get it developed, just use your comp. You don't need to install software to view your pictures.
The menus are simple to understand. The fact that the pictures are saved to a 3.5&quot; disk is of course a huge plus. I couldn't be more pleased. This Sony Mavica is a extremely easy camera to use. I Love it.
