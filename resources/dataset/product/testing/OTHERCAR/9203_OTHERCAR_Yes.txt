            We bought a 1996 Legacy Outback two years ago now.  We have been nothing but pleased since.  My wife and I are not car experts so expect this review to be the layperson's version of car reviews.

Everything positive you read about these vehicles is correct.  Handling is great, they handle extremely well in rough weather, snow, ice, etc.  (we live in Canada so we put it to the winter test regularly).  It is very comfortable, has lots of cargo space and most important to us - feels like a very safe car.  When compared to the SUV's out there (I owned one), I would take the Outback every time for value, function, quality and satisfaction.

So to make this Epinion useful, let me tell you about some of the shortcomings....
- it is a little more expensive to service and fix, although thankfully very little has gone wrong with it yet
- I am reasonably tall (6'2) and the leg room is only OK for someone like me.
- the paint seems to scratch easily (although it could just be our neighborhood kids).
- you don't really get the stated mileage - although it is close
- we have the 2.5l engine and it seems to burn oil a little aggressively

Other than that we are very, very pleased with the vehicle and will definitely be purchasing another in the near future.  I would recommend this car to anybody.<br><br>
