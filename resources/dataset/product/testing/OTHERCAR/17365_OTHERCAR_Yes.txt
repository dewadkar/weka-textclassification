            My first car was a BMW 2002 given to me by my parents as a high school graduation gift.  When I started college sadly I  realized that maintaining my pride and joy was way out of my financial ballpark.  My parents recommended that I go and take a look at a GOLF. Kicking and screaming they got me there and I took my first test drive in a car that to me was really a big step down.  Well with not too many options since my parents were helping me out with the financing.  I drove home that same day in my &quot;NEW&quot; used 1986 VW GOLF.  For weeks I complained about everything and anything about this poor innocent car (EVEN THOUGH TO MY DISMAY THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT) IN FACT I EVEN STARTED TO ACTUALLY LIKE THIS CAR....REALLY LOVE IT.  AND SO BEGAN MY LOVE OF THE VW GOLF.

I AM NOW ON MY SECOND GOLF A 1994 AND I REALLY CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT MY GOLF.  IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME, IT HAS BEEN MORE FAITHFUL THAN ANY MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN ;)
I LOVE THE FACT THAT I FEEL LIKE I AM DRIVING AN EXPENSIVE LUXURIOUS EUROPEAN SPORTS CAR AT LITERALLY HALF THE PRICE.  I LOVE THE HANDLING, THE STEERING IS TIGHTER THAN MY FAVORITE OLD JEANS.  IT HUGS THE CURVES EQUALLY AS WELL ;)     THE ONLY BUMMER I HAVE GOTTEN FROM THIS CAR IS WHEN THE AIR-CONDITIONING WENT. OTHER THAN THAT TRUTHFULLY I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE 6 YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED AND LOVED MY CAR. 
ANOTHER THING THAT I REALLY LOVE IS HOW SPACIOUS THE INTERIOR IS EVEN FOR A SUBCOMPACT CAR.  THE BACK SEAT FOLDS RIGHT DOWN AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH STUFF YOU CAN FIT BACK THERE. I HAVE MOVED MYSELF AND MANY FRIENDS AND IT IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW SPACIOUS IT REALLY IS.

IF YOU LOVE DRIVING, LIKE I DO, AND YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST DEAL FOR THE MONEY BUY A GOLF YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO ASKS ME.    <br><br>
