            Wow! What can I say about a great car? Before the new models came out I drove my 1993 Nissan Altima for 7 wonderful years. While not a large car, my Altima had ample room for me, my husband and our two children to ride around town comfortably. It has plenty of &quot;get-up-and-go&quot; and handles easily. I drove the highway everyday to work and I never worried about being able to get up to speed to merge with traffic. In my Nissan I had confidence around sharp turns and sudden stops. I could get into any parking space no matter how small! 

Another huge plus is that other than routine oil changes, this is almost a no maintenance car! In 7 years I did little other than get the oil changed and replace windshield wiper fluid, and still it ran like a Swiss watch. Oh did I mention the gas mileage? Given the gas prices today---they are running about 1.43 a gallon in the Tulsa area today---the Altima is just a common sense car. I could fill it up and drive literally hundreds of miles without having to refill. The trip to from Tulsa to Oklahoma City is a little over a hundred miles and needless to say, I made that trip many times. In each case, I would fill up before the trip, drive the round trip and still not need to refill when I got home! 

I have also had the misfortune of crash testing my beautiful Altima. I was the victim of a hit and run last November, but I am here to tell you, the Nissan took a lickin' and kept on tickin'! This is a great car that I wouldn't mind buying again and again.<br><br>
