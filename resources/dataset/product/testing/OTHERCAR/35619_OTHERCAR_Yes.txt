            I bought my 1998 Chevy Malibu LS in late 1997.  It compared well against the Camry, Accord, Taurus, etc in terms of standard features.  For instance, my Malibu has V6 engine, A/C, cruise control, P/W, P/L, aluminum wheels, fog lamps, remote keyless entry, CD player, and a similarly equipped Camry or Accord would've been $5,000-6,000 more expensive with the same options.  It also has an engine that doesn't need a tune-up for 100,000 miles.  Overall, I've been very satisfied with my Malibu.  I've now had the car 3 years next month.  I have 46,000 miles on it so far.  It needed the suspension changed and brakes adjusted, but both were covered by warranty. After the repairs, I've had no problems with either.  Heck, even if I had to pay for a few things out of pocket, the overall cost is still much lower than Camry or Accord.  Overall, I believe the Malibu is a very competent car at a good value.<br><br>
