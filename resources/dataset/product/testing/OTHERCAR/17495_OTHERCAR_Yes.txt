            I bought my 1998 Plymouth Voyager minivan over a year ago, mainly because I wanted a more comfortable ride for long drives, and because I like to have all that room for camping equipment. 

I love practically everything about it. I've found that the interior was planned in such a convenient way that I can easily pass items to the back seat cupholders while driving. I enjoy the ride very much, and find it a very comfortable seat. My van also has two sliding doors. At first I didn't see the point in it, but now I couldn't do without it! It's so easy to access everything inside that way. I have also made many trips with all the seats removed, and find that it's easier to pack large items in the back because there are so many open ways to access it. 

It handles a bit more like a car than the other vans I test-drove, and the V6 is capable of some good pickup when needed. I am more cautious on ramps and turns than I ever was in my littler cars, but I don't feel like it wants to roll out like some of the older SUV's do.

Another great thing about this van is its reliability. I have put 45,000 miles on it in just over a year, and it has never once given me trouble. All I've done for it is the regular oil change every 3,000 miles. Soon I might treat it to a tune-up and a brake job, but it hasn't shown any signs that it needs either one. It still gets an average of 22 MPG, 27 on the highway.

The only thing I can think of that I don't like about it is that there isn't a lot of leg room in the far back seat, so it's not all the comfortable to move large adults. I imagine that the Grand Voyager would have  been a better choice for those purposes. 

The reason you should buy this van, though, is it's safety. We were at a dead stop, and were rear-ended in at 60 MPH. The tailgate area crumpled so efficiently that the 2-ton van that hit us never even got to the farthest back seat, and there was no damage to the interior of the van, and no injuries among the passengers.
