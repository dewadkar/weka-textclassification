            I bought a Saturn SL2, fully loaded, new in 1997.  I had it exactly 9 mos when I took it back to the dealer I bought it from and said, &quot;Good riddens!&quot;.  I have owned 3 brand new cars and 2 used vehicles in my life, and this is, by far, the worst car I have ever owned.  

First, within the first 6 months, I had to replace the brakes TWICE!  They somehow warped both times.  Also, the computer &quot;brain&quot; of the car died and I had to have the car towed to the dealer to have THAT replaced.  I have owned 10 year old cars that had less problems than this car.

Second, knowing what I do about buying cars, I didn't like the fact that Saturn's are non-negotiable in price.  I don't feel that this class of car is worth the price tag. 

Third, I didn't like the feel of the driving experience.  It was ok, but the car did not have good pick up.  It always felt a bit sluggish.

After selling this untrustworthy vehicle back to the dealer, I went without a car for a while, then bought a used Honda Accord and still have it and LOVE IT.  I've owned a used Honda before and every experience with them I have, I can't say enough about.  

If you are looking for a new car (or used car) to buy, do yourself a favor and check out any Honda vehice.  They are highly recommended by Consumer Reports and are among the best in retaining their resale value.  My car is a 1989 Honda Accord, and it's blue book value is $5500.  Try to get THAT out of a Saturn after 11 years!

If I have not convinced you to think twice about buying a Saturn, good luck!<br><br>
