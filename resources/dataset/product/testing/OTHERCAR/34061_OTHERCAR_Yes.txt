            After my old car was totaled, I was looking for a good looking 2 door car that was somewhat sporty, but cheap. What my search lead me to was a '96 Plymouth Neon. I fell in love with the car. The car is compact enough to fit into almost any parking spot available (definiate plus for any student) yet suprisingly roomy. The only thing that I really don't like about the car is it has given me a few mechanical problems: leaky head gasket and wiring problems, but other than that, it has run well for me. The Neon get great gas mileage; almost 30 miles to the gallon on open roads. It excels well and has great brakes. The car can comfortably hold 5 medium sized people. The back seats are much bigger than they look and the trunk is quite large compared to the overall size of the car. Recently, I drove from Illinois to Florida with one passenger and a trunk full of luggage. The car ran great and neither of us had a complaint about comfortability. I plan on making the return trip and I know I won't have to worry about problems with the car. A Neon is great for new drivers, students, and small families. I love my car! If you are looking for a inexpensive, reliable car, I would recommend a Neon.<br><br>
