            I bought a cherry 1992 Jeep Cherokee in July.  So far it's been nothing but reliability and fun.  Cherokees are some of the most dependable, durable vehicles on the road.  I say this as an outdoorsman and a city dweller.  Both in the Rocky Mountains and Denver's freeways the Jeep just shines.  The only drawback is the gas mileage, but that is to be expected with any SUV.  However, the Cherokee makes up for it in so many other ways.  In my opinion you can't find a better SUV for the money.  It has far surpassed all of my expectations.  You can use it, abuse it, and enjoy it and it just keeps on going.  Best deal money can buy.<br><br>
