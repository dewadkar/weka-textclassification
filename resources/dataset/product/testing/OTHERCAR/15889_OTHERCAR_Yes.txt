            Fuel Economy.  Two words can sum up the direction that all automakers are heading these days.  While sales of gas-hungry SUV's begin to slip, new technologies are hitting the market promising greater fuel economy, which means lower emissions.  Hybrid vehicles use battery power to complement a smaller engine.  Hydrogen fuel cells promise zero emissions vehicles in the near future.

However, there's another low emissions technology on the market, one that hasn't seen much attention.  It follows the same reasoning that the hybrid vehicles do; lower fuel consumption, and you'll lower emissions.  In fact, this technology is far from new; a vehicle using it placed 18th in the 1931 Indianapolis 500, and your town's public works has been using it to transport people for decades.  This silent fuel economy miracle is none other than the lowly diesel engine.

Diesels have a certain stigma in the US.  Overseas, you can get a variety of diesel engines in almost any passenger car.  Here, they're relegated to heavy-duty work trucks or corporate vans.  In fact, in the past 10 years, only two manufacturers have sold diesel engined passenger cars in the US.  One of those manufacturers is Volkswagen, who has quietly plugged along with their diesel Golfs and Jettas through four model changes and nearly 20 years.  You've probably driven behind or parked next to them and never noticed, unless the small 'TDi' badge on the rear gave them away.

And they're not giving up yet.  The latest iteration of the Jetta has the option of the turbodiesel, or TDi, engine in two trim levels, GL or GLS.  Having only 90 horsepower, it's not considered quite sporting enough for the GLX or upcoming GLI trims, though it's 150 lb-ft of available torque will surprise anyone with a heavy foot.  If those figures don't mean anything to you, I'll explain the importance later.

The newest Jetta, redesigned in 1999, is wrapped in a very attractive skin.  Volkswagen didn't lose the somewhat boxy, European appeal of its cars, and managed to make them a bit sleeker at the same time.  The roofline is elegantly curved from the A pillars all the way back, and the vehicle has a slight rake from the hood to the trunk, giving it a muscular stance, even for a smaller car.  None of the bright, attention-getting colors of the New Beetle are available on the Jetta GL or GLS, but in the variety of modestly attractive hues anyone can find a color they like.

The interior continues where the exterior leaves off.  Volkswagen interiors are the benchmark among today's affordable cars, and slipping into one proves why.  Controls are laid out in a very intelligent manner; HVAC controls are large and easy to adjust without taking your eyes off the road.  Steering wheel stalks control directionals and wipers, plus cruise control on the GLS, instead of being cluttered with a dozen different options.  The fit is so excellent, you'd have a hard time sliding a butterknife between the panels and pieces.  Even textures are nice; many parts are rubberized or have nubby textures, giving the interior even more feel.

Inside, the car not only looks good, but it feels good.  Front seats are supportive, and adjust six ways.  The standard cloth seat fabric feels very durable, though GLS models have a leather option.  The wheel tilts and telescopes on all models, allowing any driver to find a comfortable position, and plenty of air vents means that AC will get you cooled off nice and quick (or the heat will get you nice and toasty, depending on where you live).  Tall rear seat occupants will find their knees a bit cramped, but slightly smaller ones will find the rear seats very comfortable, even on long trips.  The rear seats also flip and fold flat, adding even more cargo space to the cavernous trunk.

But, this is all true of any run-of-the-mill Jetta.  Obviously, we're talking about something else here, something needing a bit more detailed explanation.  The diesel engine of the TDi is the real focal point, and in this car it quietly takes center stage.

Someone who has preconceived notions about diesels may be surprised upon starting the car up.  It fires up quickly, even in cold weather (The TDi is even a strong seller in the US Northeast and Canada).  There is very little of the sort of rattle one expects to hear n the first few minutes while the engine warms up.  More importantly, there is no 'diesel smell' in the cabin at all, and it is even hard to notice standing outside of the running car.  At idle, it would be hard to distinguish the car from one with an ordinary gasoline engine.

However, once driving, you will notice the difference, in a good way.  One facet of diesel engines is that they don't rev as high as traditional gasoline engines.  Drivers of manual transmission TDi Jettas will find it a bit unnatural to shift so early.  Of course, the generous torque (150 lb-ft, remember?) will also be a surprise, especially when passing on the highway.  Whereas an ordinary car will force you to downshift when you pull out to pass, the gobs of torque which the diesel produces scoot the car forward even in top gear, with no complaints.  Of course, those who opt for the $500 4-speed automatic transmission don't have to worry about it as much, but those with the 5-speed manual will find their driving habits challenged by the engine.

There's another advantage to the generous torquwe the TDi engine provides.  In other economy vehicles that return higher gas mileage, if you load up the vehicle you'll quickly see those numbers plummet.  Not so with the TDi, as it's an expert at hauling people and cargo.  With a full load of passengers and items in the trunk (or the back of the spacious wagon), the TDi doesn't complain and mileage barely decreases.

On top of all that, the TDi returns phenomenal fuel economy figures.  In fact, the TDi Jetta and Golf were numbers 3 and 4 of the nation's top ten fuel frugal cars, right behind the hybrid Honda Insight and Toyota Prius. Of course, actual returns will vary depending on the driver and the transmission (the manual provides slightly better economy), but the average driver should find themselves getting 40-50 miles per gallon in mixed driving.  The only real downside to the engine is refueling; in some areas it's hard to find a station that has diesel, and the fuel has a strong oily smell.

The Jetta, like the Golf it's based on, rides on progressive rate springs.  This is a spring that is soft initially, but becomes gradually firmer as more stress is applied.  This means that city bumps and potholes are sufficiently smoothed out, but when pressed into a turn or emergency maneuver the car bites in with aplomb (along with a bit of excessive body roll).  This, accompanied with great steering feel, gives the driver a wonderful connection with the road not felt in many other cars of this price.  The driver will always feel confident that they know what the car is doing, and this is what ultimately provides for the fun of driving a Volkswagen.

Safety is top-notch.  Driver and passenger front and side airbags are standard, and crumple zones are engineered into the vehicle body.  The Jetta is also very solid-feeling, helped by its relatively high weight for this size of car; the TDi weighs in around 3100lbs.  Reliability isn't as issue with Volkswagen's new 4 year, 40,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  This warranty is new for 2002, replacing the old 2-year B-2-B that served to only reduce consumer trust in the cars, and is complemented by a 5-year powertrain warranty.  These warranties are also transferable to an immediate family member, so a new TDi today will still be under warranty when junior graduates in 2005.

The 4-year warranty was sorely needed, as Volkswagens have always had a reputation as being 'quirky' cars.  Of course, 'quirky' is just a VW Owner's way of saying 'it has annoying little problems'.  While these problems usually are truly little, it's nice to know that they'll be fixed after what's essentially a 24-month break-in period.

So, with so few strikes against it and so much praise, it seems like everyone should be driving one, right?  Well, you get what you pay for, and Volkswagens are no longer the dirt-cheap econocars they once were.  A base model TDi, with no options, will set you back just a hair under $20,000.  Move up to the GLS package, which includes niceties like a CD player, cruise control, and fog lamps, and you're adding about $1500.  There is also a wagon body style available, which will cost about $1000 more than a similarly equipped sedan.  With options, it's easy to bump the price nearer $25,000, though at that price you'll feel like you're driving a mini-luxury car with leather, sunroof, and premium sound system.  In addition, many dealers have a waiting list for the diesel engined cars, and an unscrupulous dealer may tack on a premium for a car with a higher demand than there is supply.

However, considering the other 'green' vehicle choices around - hybrids - the Jetta TDi isn't that expensive, and really falls right in line with the Insight and Prius.  Add the fact that there's much more room inside the Jetta than either, and you find it to be the perfect compromise of mind and ego.  And, with a range of about 600 miles on a single tank, you'll be able to visit every friend and relative to show it off.
