            I originally bought the car because I liked the size of the car.  Both me and my wife have a large frame and each of us stand taller than six feet.  As the days went by I found that the gas mileage was what I was looking for around twenty miles per gallon.  As time went by along with the odometer going up I found that the repairs other than normal maintenance such as tires, oil and such were not happening.  Close to 100,000 miles I found that I had to replace the lower control arms and that the cost was only sixty dollars each and didn't require a lot of time to repair.  In all I would say that I had made a great investment.  <br><br>
