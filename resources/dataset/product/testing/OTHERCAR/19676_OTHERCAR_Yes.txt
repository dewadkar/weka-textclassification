            There's no question that we're a Saturn family.  In my immediate family alone we own four of them: a 95 SL2, a 97 SC2, a 99 SL1, and a 00 SL2.  We didn't get them for their looks though (well... maybe the SC2); we were simply looking for reliable cars local and long-distance traveling.  

As of this writing we haven't had any significant problems with any of our Saturns.  Our oldest, the 95 SL2 is up to 140,000miles on its original clutch and is still my preference for long-distance trips.  But this is supposed to be about our SL1, so...

We have had our 99 SL1 for a couple years now.  Although it clearly doesn't have as much power as the SL2s and SC2, it still has no problem getting around on the mountainous terrain we live in.  The only problem we've had with it was a problem with the ignition switch right from the dealer when we bought it used.  The repair was relatively quick and inexpensive.  At this time, the car has 60,000 miles, maintains 35-36mpg on the highway, and is showing no signs of problems.  

I do have two complaints with Saturns.  The interiors appear cheap and all Saturns seem to develop an oil consumption problem as they age.  Although the problem is tolerable (about 1qt/1000 miles in the 95 SL2 with 140,000 miles), it is a bit of a nuisance.  

Saturn's biggest bonus, aside of its reliability record, is its design under the hood.  This is by far one of the easiest cars to work on that I've owned.  The use of a timing chain instead of a timing belt and the lack of a distributor takes away the possibility of many repairs common in most other cars.  The placement of spark plugs, the air box, and all the fluid filling points makes routine maintenance simple.  

I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for reliability but not so concerned about style.
