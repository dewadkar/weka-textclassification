            I've had my miata for less than a year but I LOVE IT TO DEATH.  This car is great for the money with some minor drawbacks.
First is the interior.  The seats are very comfortable, your body seems to fit into them very snug and they provide excellent support. Some people say it is cramped but I think it adds to the sporty feel and actually make it more comfortable because it is more snug.  The controls are excellent and very visable. Another nice feature is the awsome sound system, the speakers are great for being stock. The leather interior has held up nicely but can get VERY hot in the summer.  The trunk offers little room for storage so don't plan on taking a vacation in this car.

Next is driving.  Driving this thing is a blast.  The handling is AWESOME.  you can turn on a dime with this baby.  The ride is also fairly smooth.  Acceleration is great.  Going from stoplight to stoplight is a blast with the miata.  One of the best parts is the shifter.  The stick throw is so short and feels like butter, it's really a joy to use.  So far I have not encountered any problems of anykind with my miata.

Overall the miata is a great car for getting around in the summer.  With all it's great features added up it results as a great little car.
