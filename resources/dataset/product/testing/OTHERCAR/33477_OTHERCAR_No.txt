            In 1991 I inherited a brand new Cavalier RS from my grandmother. She had picked the car out of a selection of program cars. The price (at that time) was $13,500 for a/c, AM/FM radio, and automatic transmission only - she wrote them a check for $10,000 even and rode off the lot in a brand new car. For a sixteen year old girl, that car was the embodiment of freedom and fun ... at least until the repair began to add up.
Now my little Cavalier is nine years old and has a little over 112,000 miles on it. I have to tell you, my car is a HEAP! First allow me tell you everything I have had to replace and how many times : alternator (3x), water pump (1x), starter (2x),radiator (1x), cooling system (2x), and cylinder head (1x). Next, let me tell you why it looks like a traveling trash can on wheels : the head liner is down and refuses to tack back up, the paint is peeling all around the hood, all the side molding has fallen off, and the seats' material has worn thin and ripped in some places. (And I won't even mention how many times I have been stuck on the side of the road - usually at night.)
Granted, a younger person probably doesn't take care of a car as good as she should - but should a car literally fall apart this bad? I think not.<br><br>
