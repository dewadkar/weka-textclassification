            1995 was the last year the Volvo 940 was made.  It was essentially an updated and improved upon version of the 700 series Volvos, which debuted in 1982.  Mechanically, the 940 is identical to the cheaper and older 700 series, discontinued in 1992.  The standard 2.3L 114hp 4-cylinder engine was the original engine used on the first 700 series models.  The optional 2.3L 160-162hp 4-cylinder debuted in the 700 series in 1987 in the U.S.  
     The Volvo 940 is 13 years of improvement on, what was even in it's early years, an incredibly reliable and long lasting car.  Over the years, the model was improved upon little by little.  I like to think of the 940 as about as perfect any vehicle could possibly be for people who value safety and reiability over up-to-date, modern looks.  In its last form, the 1995 Volvo 940 was available with two engines (both proven to be highly durable), standard dual-airbags, ABS brakes, side-impact door beams, and many other safety features.  For a 1995 luxury vehicle, these features are nothing special.  Most luxury cars had them by that time.  However, the ABS brakes and driver-side airbag had been available since the late 1980's in Volvos 700 series cars, years before Mercedes and BMW introduced a model with those options.
     Surprisingly, the Volvo 940 can be bought at incredibly low prices, especially when compared to it's competition from Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus.  Not to mention they actually are no more costly to repair than comparable models of those other brands I mentioned.  There is only one key aspect of Volvos, including the 940, that is not so great.  The fuel consumption is quite bad.  The standard and anemic 2.3L 114hp 4-cylinder engine gets a marginal 20/25 EPA.  That kind of fuel consumption would be reasonable for a car the size and weight of the 940 if it was a reasonably powerful engine, but it is terribly weak.  It's about the equivalent to driving a Ford Taurus or Chevy Lumina with a 4-cylinder engine.  The optional 2.3L 162hp 4-cylinder engine is just as reliable, smoother, quieter, and MUCH more powerful.  It propels the 3200  pound 940 to 60mph in about 8 seconds and about 10.5 seconds with the base engine, both being acceptable, but not special, acceleration times even for this day and age.
     My mother's Volvo has over 190,000 miles on it and has needed few repairs over the years.  The largest problems being the failure of the alternator and AC compressor.  It is still on the original engine and transmission with the only repairs made to both being gasket and seal replacements.  My Volvo has been slightly more problematic, needing replacement of the above mentioned repairs, as well as the raditor, and one of the tie-rods.  Considering it too is on the original engine and transmission and has approximately 160,000 miles, I still consider it to be a terrifically reliable car.  
Now what would make an educated person want to go out and spend literally twice as much on a less safe, less reliable BMW, Mercedes, or any of the other mentioned brands?  If you are wealthy and do not have to worry about the reliability of your vehicle, then Volvo is probably not a great option for you.  However, if you are on a budget like most people out there and need solid, safe, and reliable transportation at an affordable cost, I HIGHLY recommend the Volvo 940.   
     Did you know Volvo invented the driver-side airbag and had been testing it since the early 1970's?  Did you know Volvo invented the 3-point safety belt?  Did you know Volvo invented the idea of "crumple zones"?  Volvo has always put great emphasis on both safety and reliablility, which to me are the two most important aspects of a car.  What does a car with good looks get you when broken down on the side of the road?  What does a car with good looks get you when you are killed or seriously injured in an accident?  Nothing.  To make sense of these important car issues, think of cars as if they are people.  It will be easier to understand this way.  What is more important to you...an attractive person who is heartless and brainless (most American cars)or a person who wears last years clothing, but has the smarts of Einstein and a heart of gold (most Volvos)?  I guess you will answer that question based on your own values as a person.  Some people value looks, while others value quality in a person as well as in the car they own.  The car you drive does say A LOT about you as a person.
