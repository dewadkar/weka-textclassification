            Being a proud owner of a '99 Toyota Corolla I encourage readers to buy toyota!  I am very happy with my Corolla CE, it is the &quot;middle&quot; model and its options are great!  Being about $1,000 dollars less than the LE the only thing the CE is missing is about two options! The Tachometer and the power sideview mirriors...which I could do without.  Everything else like the windows, locks are powered. (The antenna is unpowered-but no big deal becuase those power antennas usually break down in less than five years!)

I get about 25 miles per gallon city and about 37-38 miles per gallon on highways. (Being a college student and riding back and fourth from college) I've got this car for a year now and I've put 20,000+ miles on it and its still running beautiful...the idle is as quiet as the first day i bought it!  The engine packs 120 hp and it comes with rear and front anti-sway bars built in! It has daul overhead cames (DOHC) with 16-valves which means more hp/liter, and considering it weighs about 2,600 lbs (give or take a little) the horsepower to weight ratio is &quot;pretty good&quot;.

The only thing that I feel to have a disadvantage is that the gas pedal is &quot;Squished&quot; too far to the right and the break pedal too close to the gas pedal.  Some of you users with larger feet may feel the same and this is also noted in popular vehicle magazines.  But overall...this sure beats your ford's and chevy's compact cars! by a long shot!  Come join the thousands of satisfied corolla owners!
c u on the road!!!!! <br><br>
