            I have a 1998 RAV4 that I bought new.  Two years later, I am just as in love with it as when I first got it, or maybe I should say, BEFORE I got it.

I fell in love with the RAV when it first came out, but did not have the means to buy one at that time.  In 1998, when my husband and I were expecting our first child and needed to replace my questionably reliable and certainly impractical Hyundai Scoupe with a more family-friendly car, the RAV was the answer.  I'm rather short and didn't want a huge vehicle.....okay, maybe that's not completely true.  I would LOVE to be able to spend $35-40,000 on a big Range Rover or Lexus SUV, but that just wasn't an option for us!  Anyway, the size and feel of the RAV is perfect for someone, like me, that is upgrading from a small vehicle.  It handles just like a car, but I love the visibility you get from a SUV.

I don't have ALL the bells and whistles on my RAV, but we do have the security system which allows for remote keyless entry into the vehicle.  With one child and another on the way, my arms are always full.  Its great to be able to press the remote button to quickly lock or unlock the doors.  We also went for anti-lock brakes, which is a huge asset and great sense of security for us as we deal with those unpredictable Wisconsin winters.  The seating and leg room is excellent, and I love the cargo space in the back.  The seats fold forward to allow a good amount of cargo space.

All in all, I love this car!  If you're in the market for an SUV and want something mid-size, definitely look into the RAV4!<br><br>
