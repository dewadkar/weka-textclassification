            My husband &amp; I originally were looking at buying a Chevy Venture. We had numerous problems with the dealer and I went browsing onto a Pontiac lot.  Once I drove the Montana, there was no turning back.

I assumed it would be the same van, but I was proven wrong immediately.  Not only is the styling on the Montana sportier and more stylish than the Venture, but it actually seems to ride and handle better as well.

I was also impressed with such features as the steering wheel mounted audio controls and the power sliding door. The audio controls should be standard equipment on every vehicle made. This feature allows me to change stations and control the CD player without ever having to take my eyes off the road. The power sliding door has proven itself to be extremely handy when my hands are full. I only wish the power was available on both doors.

Other features that are often overlooked that I find very useful are: one-touch down power window; power rear windows; and modular seats.  The one-touch power window is just plain neat.  The power rear windows are great to get fresh air moving through the van without having the fan on. The seats are invaluable when it comes to hauling things other than groceries. They are lightweight and easily removable, without losing their comfort.

While we have the regular length model, I would recommend the extended length model to all interested in this van. The regular length is just not long enough.  The room behind the rear seats is minimal at best. We need to fold up at least one of the 3rd row seats to fit in all our groceries.

Another problem I have is with the size of the windshield washer fluid tank. Either the tank is too small, or the spray is too much, because there never seems to be enough fluid for the rear windshield.

We have had this van for 10 months and have had no mechanical problems with this van. My husband would say that the body molding is cheaply designed, and I would agree. The wheel well trim seems to want to pop off.

I would recommend this van- extended model- to anyone in the market for a family friendly vehicle. The available option of seating for 8 should impress those looking at high end SUVs but not wanting the bulk of those beasts, as this van will easily slide into any garage.<br><br>
