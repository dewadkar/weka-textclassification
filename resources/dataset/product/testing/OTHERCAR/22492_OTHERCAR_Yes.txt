            Ten years ago, October 24, 1990, just after midnight, the first Saturn was sold in California.   This �little car company that could� has come a long way since then, and yet they haven�t come far at all.  It�s easy to see why people love these little cars so much �they have character.  And people do love them, try saying something negative about a Saturn in a crowded room � oh the dirty looks.  Few American cars looked as distinct as the first Saturns, much like today, in a world of generic Camrys and Accords, Saturn cars look a little different (if not a bit dated as well).

General Motors has always done a pretty poor job of making small cars, and small engines � and then along came Saturn.  But, what the L series Saturns have needed from the start is a V-6.

The L series wagon can be ordered with one of two engines; a 2.2 L twin-cam 4-cylinder (120hp), or a 3.0 L V-6 (182hp). Guess which one is the best.  That�s right it�s the V-6.  The LW300 shares its basic engine with another Opel based American car, the Cadillac Catera, although it�s detuned to 182 horses where the Catera gives a little over 200.  182 horsepower doesn�t sound like much considering a car like the Honda Civic Si gives you 160.  But on the road the L series feels more powerful than its numbers would suggest. 

Acceleration is brisk, and smooth.  Stomp on the gas and the downshift is effortless.  While there is quite a bit of engine noise at higher RPMs, it is a controlled noise, almost exciting, maybe even racy sounding.  In short, the engine noise is there but doesn�t cause worry the way GM�s 4-cylinder engines do.  At highway speed the ride is firm, almost sporty.  No wallowing or floaty feeling (I really hate that floating feeling in a car).  Steering is precise, quick and there is little body roll � its European roots are showing, although when pushed hard there is noticeable tire squeal. Road and tire noise at highway speed is a little more than one might expect for a $22,000 car.  

Remember $22,000 puts the buyer right in the middle of Camry and Accord territory.    But Camry and Accord don�t come as wagons.  

Inside the Saturn L series wagon are quality textures and materials, not much cheap, shiny plastic. Faux wood trim is� interesting.  Power drivers seat is easy to use, but lacks the ability to go up or down without tilting.  If you want to lower the seat, the rear part of the seat cushion goes down.  As a contrast, the Toyota Camry has a power drivers seat that will do up or down without tilting.  Seats are comfortable, but a little flat.  Strangely, the cloth seats seem more comfortable than the leather.  Rear seat room is adequate, a 2 hour or more trip would be fine.  Getting in and out of the rear passenger area is a little tight for those over 5�10�.  Rear cargo area is large and has frame anchored tie downs (SUVs have changed how we look at cars forever), as well as convenient storage bins built right into the floor.  The back seat folds down easily, but utilizing the 60/40 split function requires a little more effort.  

Standard CD/AM-FM/Cassette stereo sounds good, about average considering how good many stock stereos have become.  Audiophiles should opt for the upgraded system with separate sub-woofer.  Rear passengers get a fold-down armrest with cup holders, a luxury feature in a budget car is always a good thing. Controls are easy to use and reach � it all makes perfect sense.  Steering wheel mounted cruise controls switches are a nice detail.  Instrument cluster is straightforward and simple (maybe even bland).

Overall the Saturn L series wagon is much more than the sum of its parts.  There is a playfulness, or a sporty-ness to these cars that defies explanation.  Perhaps the L series wagon, like other Saturns, has a soul.  Camry has no soul, it is an appliance.  Speaking of the Toyota Camry, what does one compare the L series wagon to?  What other wagons are there?  Volvo, Saab, BMW, and Mercedes all have wagons, but those cost much more than a loaded Saturn.  The Ford Focus comes in a wagon, but lacks the cargo space.  Frankly the Saturn wagon looks just as good as any of the more expensive European wagons.  It has a sleekness to it.  Combine value with the Saturn sales experience and it�s easy drive home with a new best friend � OK it�s just a car, but you�d never know by talking to Saturn owners.
