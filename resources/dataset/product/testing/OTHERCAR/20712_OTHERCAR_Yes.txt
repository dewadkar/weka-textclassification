            The '99 Acura Integra is one of the best cars that I have ever had the chance to experience.  If you're a person who has had an older Acura, you need to get the updated '99 Acura with all of the new specs and performance.  The difference in the '99 and the older ones is really spectacular, and amazing.  Although there are too many features to list right now I can provide you with some of the more updated things that you might need to know.


Here are the things about the performance that you should know:

The comfort of this car is amazing.  The top of the line GS-R leather makes your ride not only enjoyable, but soothing at the same time.
The grace of the drive-train would be the same as racing down a straight away as if you were the only one on the road.

The mileage is okay for a sports car, but it is worth the gas money for this ride.

The maintenence of the '99 Acura Integra is nothing major, only a few minor oil changes when neccessary; at least every three months (recommended) which is not a major hassle.

Well there is really nothing more to say about this great car.  I recommend this car for people who really like a good deal.  I also recommend this car for people who have &quot; the need for speed!!!!!&quot;
