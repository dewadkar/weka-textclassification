            We have owned this van for 8 years and will be trading/selling it soon for a more reliable van.  It has been the vehicle we've used for making long road trips.  We love the plush interior.  The roof rack has been used to carry our car-top carrier (which gives us more room inside the van).  Our next van will be a Grand/Extended van.  It would have been nice to have some extra room, and maybe we would not have had to use a car-top carrier.

It is an older van (110,000+ miles) and it drives like a truck compared to the more recent models.  Because it is a Turbo, the oil must be changed more frequently (every 3,000 miles...or every 3-6 months).  If you are considering a Turbo (if you can find one), learn more about this need to get the oil changed frequently.  Apparently, the engine can be damaged if the oil is allowed to become "old."  We have been faithful in this regard.  The oil has been changed as recommended (even though it has not been driven over 3,000 miles within a 3-6 month period at times.)  We will not be buying a 4-cylinder van again.  It  was lacking in power...very sluggish...especially in town.

We have had problems with this van since we purchased it (used) back in 1994.  Not major problems...just annoying  problems mostly.  Oil leaks, rear-hatch won't stay open, whining sounds, rear-hatch lock assembly defective (the hatch will not close. It was replaced once as part of a recall.  Now Plymouth refuses to replace it again).  

Last summer, the van would intermittently refuse to start.  No rhyme or reason.  It would refuse to start...but it would start a half-hour later.  It would start up fine for a week or so.  Then it would refuse to start again.  It was difficult to "fix" because it would always start for our mechanic.  We let him keep the van for a few days during which he periodically went out and tried to start it.  Finally, after the third day, it wouldn't start for him.  Anyway, he replaced a relay switch (he couldn't figure out why it wouldn't start. Everything checked out fine on his diagnostic equipment...but he thought he would try replacing the switch to see if that would help.)  So far, it has always started since.

The air conditioner went out a year ago.  We did not replace it because we can't justify the cost for a vehicle this age.  Needless to say,  this van is no longer one we will want to take on long summer trips.  It is just not a reliable vehicle anymore.

This van has been a comfortable van, but one that has been troublesome mechanically.  We have baby'd this van and drive it with care but have had problems none-the-less. The craftsmanship just isn't very good.  American carmakers need to take lessons from Honda.
