            The 2000 Chevy Astro Cargo Van is quite an improvement over the models of previous years.  The entire van is designed not only for function, but also for comfort.  The driver and passenger seats are high backed crew chairs that are built for comfort.  The Optional rear bench seat offers more leg room then the average cargo van, that focuses on maximizing the cargo space.  True, you lose a little of the cargo area, but not enough to be missed and what you get in return is three additional comfortable seats with more then adequate leg room.

The 2000 Chevy Astro Cargo Van also has better handling then it ever has.  The new sleeker body design provides less wind resistance that improves the drive.  

There are also some helpful features on this model.  For example, to avoid the problem of locking your keys in the van, there's a lockout provision.  The driver side door will not lock if the key is still in the ignition.  This model also sports power locks, windows and seats.

If you need to purchase a cargo van for business or personal use I would highly recommend taking a look at the 2000 Chevy Astro Cargo Van.<br><br>
