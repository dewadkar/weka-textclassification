            My wife and I were looking into buying a new vehicle in July.  We looked at all the available models and decided on this particular car because of the power, roominess, available options; to include the CD player, upgraded GT engine, keyless entry, power driver seat, cruise control, daytime running lights.  My wife wanted a sporty car, which this definitely is, but she also wanted a practical car with a roomy trunk and rear seat.  The Grand Am is fun to drive and with the warranty that you get, maintenance is a breeze, you just take it in to the dealer!!  The only problem that we have had with service is that the radio with the CD player in it has a problem with the volume control.  It has been turned in and we are waiting for the new radio to come in.  Apparently so is everyone else with this problem, due to the fact that we are third on the list to get ours repaired and there are no radios on the shelf to replace the broken ones with.  If you are looking at getting a 2000 model, I would definitely look at this car, just make sure that you play with the radio at the dealership.<br><br>
