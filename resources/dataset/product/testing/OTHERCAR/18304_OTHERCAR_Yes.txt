            It took some work to get a dealer to even order a 6 speed for my new 2000 Cummins diesel.  I was moving up from the same truck (1997) which had the 5 speed with the diesel, so my comparison is 100% apples to apples.

The truck is a 3/4 ton HD Diesel, 4x4 extended cap with 8 foot bed - BIG TRUCK. I was looking for the butterfly doors and the new trany spacing.  I loved the 97 too.  

I pull a 3500 lb snowmobile trailer in the worst of winter weather. 
The engine produces 460 ftlbs of guts while the 235 horses are more than enough. What I had found with the 5 speed was I had to run the revs up in 3rd to get to the bottom of the 4th gear torque curve.  The 6 speed corrects the gear spacing to perfection (2250 revs shifts down to 1850 for all gear changes).

As for who should buy this? Someone looking to get the most out of their truck.  Many people I've talked to don't like the Autos as they are detuned. The 5 speed is MUCH better than the autos but the 6 speed is for those who drive their trucks and want total control over all that torque.
If your lazy and don't care about control over bad roads, ice and snow, or off road, buy something else.  This is a truck for people who think about driving.

For those who have never had a diesel I would recommend one to anyone who has a truck for what a truck is. I would not recommend one for someone who thinks a truck is a tall car or open backed SUV.  I used mine in all climates from 102F to -35F without even a small problem. Cold starts after a night of -30 (with no plug in)were as good or better than gas. Never had fuel problems.  It's big heavy and a bit loud, but if you use the radio you'll never notice.  

Gas trucks I've owned of this size gave me 6 to 9 MPG.  I get 16 to 20 MPG with the diesel and I drive hard and fast, certainly not for economy. I use both high and low ranges so having 12 gears forward is goodness for me in 4x4.  

Finally, the extra cost for the 6 speed and diesel is recovered at 35,000 miles with fuel savings. These engines are now rated for 400,000 miles before they need a rebuild.
