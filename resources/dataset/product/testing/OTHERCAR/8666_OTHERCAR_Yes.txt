            For the past two years, I've been very happy with a Sony Mavica 73.  I adjusted to using an LCD screen instead of a viewfinder and though the resolution was not the greatest, it still was much better for my uses than a film camera.

In the spring, I went to a tulip festival and took about 100 pictures.  I was very happy with them until I saw pictures that a friend took with her Olympus.  The clarity was so much greater that it was the difference between night and day.

I set a friend to looking on eBay for a good camera for me.  She came up with a good price on an Olympus C-700 Camedia.  It came with other goodies, like a camera bag, extra batteries, battery recharger, and a 64 meg smartmedia card, in addition to the 8 that comes with the camera.

I've been thrilled with it.  The learning curve is a bit steeper and I still haven't mastered all the bells and whistles, but the quality of the photos is exceptional (I'm no expert and I've heard there are clearer cameras out there, but the difference has got to be something that is only visible to experts because I sure couldn't ask for anything better than this.)

I like the fact that I finally have a VIEWFINDER after squinting thru an LCD screen all these years.  

I love the ability to take 15-sec. sound movie clips.

I love the flexibility, the ability to be totally automated, but the ability to use your own settings as well.

I am extremely pleased with this purchase.

If there are down sides, one would be that it's not a "pocket camera," and you do need to carry it in a camera bag.  Also the batteries for the Sony lasted quite a long time, while the batteries for this camera give out sooner, but by the same token, I've had to order Sony batteries by mail, so it requires planning ahead, while I can run into the nearest drug store, in a pinch, and buy batteries.  (The recharge time for the rechargeable batteries isn't that long either).

I highly recommend this camera.  The negatives are far outweighed by the positives.
