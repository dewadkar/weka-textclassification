            Sleek, subtle styling and a hardy performer in a near-luxury UNDER $30,000. I am looking for reasons to drive again. Something I haven't done since I was know-it-all 16 year old with my newly pressed drivers license.

If you are looking for a flat out high performance vehicle, this is NOT the car. If you are looking for a comfortable stylish ride, with all the amenities of luxury car, then this is your car. Acceleration is good for this class. The manual shift options is very slick. 

The navigation system seems like a waste, unless you spend a great deal of time getting lost.<br><br>
