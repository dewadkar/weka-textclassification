            I have a 1997 Red Toyota Celica with a 5 speed manual transmission!  It has everything anyone could want in a car!  It gets great gas mileage, excellent handling on the corners and on the road, fast pickup time, excellent reliability!  I have never had a problem with anything on this car.

It has a CD, Cassette, AM-FM Radio, Sun Roof, Rims, Power Windows, Power Door Locks, keyless entry system, anti-theft system and on and on!  I got a great deal for it because it was November and it was sitting in their showroom taking up space.  I considered buying a new one but changed my mind!  The year 97 was a great looking model year.

I have all the power I want and more with my 5 speed.  Everyone loves the way it looks!  I traded in a Subaru for this and I will always stick with Toyota or Subaru - no one else.  I plan on keeping this Celica for a long time.  

They seem to just run and run and run!  It could be years before I buy another car.  I can't say enough good about my car and have been totally satisfied the whole time that I have had it!<br><br>
