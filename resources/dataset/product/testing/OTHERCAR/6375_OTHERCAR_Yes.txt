            I recently purchased a Monte Carlo 2000 - and love it!  It's ride is exceptional, and the package is a great one.  I have a moon roof, premium sound system with cd/cassette, LS model.  If you have a chance to drive one, do it!  You won't regret it!  Be sure to get out on the highway to open it up and let the engine breathe a little.  Also try the country roads and feel the Monte Carlo hug the curves with it's 16&quot; tires! Noise is minimal and the instruments are easy to read.  The flip down rear seat also adds space to the large trunk.  Have fun!<br><br>
