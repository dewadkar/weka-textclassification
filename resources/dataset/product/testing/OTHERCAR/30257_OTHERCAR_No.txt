            Lets put it this way, Agfa makes good products but they also make cr*ppy products. (Excuse my French)  And one of these stupid products is the Agfa ePhoto Smile.  


When I first decided to buy a digital camera I looked for a cheap, easy one that I could break without worrying too much.  So I decided to buy the Smile.  It sounded cool and promised good pictures and great fun.  But it was everything but fun and the pictures could not even be distinguished.  

The smile digital camera is a small, light, blue camera that takes pictures at what I believe to be 640 by 480 resolution.  But from what I saw, the pictures were taken of a swamp monster formerly known as my cat, on a foggy night, in the pitch black.  If that sounds like that kind of pictures you want from your camera then buy this one but if you want one that takes clear crisp photos then buy something else.  I think that Agfa did the world disservice when they created this camera.  Absolutely 0 photos came out and I tried all kinda of situations such as sunlight, indoors, close, far, it didn't matter, you couldn't see the pictures taken.  About that only good thing about this camera was that it came with batteries and that you can view your photos on the TV set.  But that doesn't help if you don't have any quality photos to view in the first place.

In conclusion, do not buy this camera unless it is for a gag gift or you really need to pay $100 dollars for something and all of the Pauly Shore dolls, and poo in a can are taken.
