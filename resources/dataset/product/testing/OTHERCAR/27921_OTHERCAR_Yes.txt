            I purchased my Jeep Cherokee with 80'000 km on it and did so only because some aquaintances of mine had recommended it so highly. I have been very pleased with my purchase. My Jeep was bought with the intention of putting it through some tough use on and off road. In stock form the vehicle's on road abilities blow the others in its class away.I have found my Cherokee to be faster, better handling and better breaking than Ford Explorers, and the Toyota 4Runner (which I was also considering) loses too.
 Since purchasing it, i have added a 5 inch lift kit, and 32&quot; tires to my little truck. I have yet to meet a situation offroad that it couldn't handle.
Cargo capacity is also more than adequate, I moved boxes of books, my computer equipment, my free-weights, and bench (the bench press type), plus lots of odds and ends in one trip from my apartment to my parents house. This vehicle can hold quite a bit, and unlike imitation SUV's it has a very respectable payload capacity, more inline with some manufacturer's fullsize trucks.
Fuel economy is down from the little Acura Integra I drove previously, but the extra torque, is well worth the trade off.
I have personally seen a friends truck tortured trough a very aggressive teenage driver, still get 500'000 km before needing a new engine. I have heard of the 4.0L inline six lasting even longer. The 2.5L four cylinder engine is generally regarded by my Jeep driving friends as a waste of time. The 4.0L is reliable, powerful, and generates reasonable fuel economy.
If off-roading is in your future, don't sell yourself short. Get the real thing, get a Jeep.<br><br>
