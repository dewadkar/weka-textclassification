            <b>Intro...</b>
I began shopping for a new car when I had given up on my 2002 Volkswagen GTI 337 Edition and it's never-ending string of problems (and dealership foul-ups when attempting to correct the problems).  I knew I wanted something bigger, faster, and of a higher build quality.

I considered the following vehicles:
Infiniti G35 and G35 Coupe
Nissan Maxima
Nissan Altima 3.5SE
Nissan 350Z
Lincoln LS
Cadillac CTS
Subaru WRX STi
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII
Mazda RX-8

Out of all these vehicles, the Evo VIII had the best combination of performance, affordability, handling, comfort, styling and gadgets that I was looking for.  Of course, many of these cars were more comfortable, but lacked power and performance.  Some were too small (RX-8, 350Z) and some were not all they were said to be (WRX STi).

The WRX felt gummy compared to the Evo...soft and cushy even though it had 30 more horsepower.  That power wasn't really evident to me.  It just felt more pedestrian, overall.  The Evo VIII was harsh, yet at the same time glorious.

So I decided on the Evo.  It took me two tries to find a dealer who was willing to work with me.  The first wanted a $8,000 "market adjustment" for the car.  They also offered me $13,000 for my 2002 GTI which was a total scam.  They also wanted to sell me a car that wasn't what I wanted...they would get an aftermarket sunroof installed, at extra cost of course.  I told them they were nuts and walked out.

Second time was a charm.  No market adjustment on the car, it had the color ("Apex" Silver) and options I wanted (power moonroof, big Carbon Fiber wing) and they gave me plenty on the trade of my GTI.  It also just so happened that my car came off the showroom floor with 7 miles on it.  It had been professional detailed and looked like a million bucks.  I must have looked like a crazed fool driving away in it...my smile stretched from ear to ear.

<b>Brief overview</b>
I think the most important feature of this car is it's handling.  Sure, it's "4G63" engine (2.0L DOHC Turbo I-4, 271 hp, 273 lb-ft) has one of the highest specific outputs of any engine in production (135.5 hp per liter of engine displacement).  But the thing that always amazes me is how well this car handles.  All-wheel drive and an amazing aluminum suspension, plus 10 years of World Rally Championship chassis and suspension tuning add up to one of the best handling cars ever produced.  The Evo VIII never, ever feels out of control.  If you get it a little sideways, let off the gas, and she comes right back into line, and does it quickly.  This car inspires confidence in your driving and urges you to stretch it's legs.  If you read the popular car magazines - Road and Track, Car and Driver, Motor Trend - you'll notice that the Evo VIII consistently has one of the highest slalom speed numbers of any of the other cars the magazines test.  In Road and Track, there is another statistic in which the Evo ranks best.  This leads me to...

<b>It BRAKES!</b>
The Lancer Evolution VIII is the best stopping vehicle you can purchase in the United States.  The Evolution VIII comes from the factory with four-piston, 12.65-inch front and 11.8-inch two-piston rear Brembo brakes, vented all around.  According to Road and Track's road test of the Evo VIII, it stops from 60-mph in 108 feet.  This is the best braking distance recorded by Road and Track's test staff for any production vehicle. Road and Track tested the new $660,000 Ferrari Enzo a few months later.  The Enzo stops in 109 feet, with carbon-ceramic brakes, half the weight of the Evo VIII and that obnoxious price tag.)  Absolutely amazing braking performance from a car which costs 1/22nd of the price of the almighty Ferrari Enzo.  

<b>Wheels and Tires</b>
The wheels are super lightweight aluminum alloy Enkei 17-inchers.  The tires are ultra-high performance, super-sticky Yokohama Advan A046 racing slicks with cut grooves.  Yokohama developed these tires specifically for the Evolution VIII, so of course they're a perfect match.  The Tire Rack carries the Advan A046 for $208 a piece, so I'm trying to baby them.  I've heard some people replacing bald Advan A046's at 6000 miles.

<b>The Engine</b>
As stated before, the engine is a 2.0 litre turbocharged 4-cylinder with four valves per cylinder, a cast iron block, aluminum heads and a magnesium head cover.  The intake, exhaust, turbocharger impeller and housing, camshafts and crankshaft were all developed from technology used on Mitsubishi's all-conquering World Rally Championship Lancer Evolution over the past 10  years of competition.  The camshafts are hollow to reduce rotating inertia.  The turbocharger has a "twin-scroll" impeller with double the amount of fins.  The exhaust housing has dual chambers, routing the exhaust gases from the #1 and #4 cylinders to one side of the twin-scroll turbocharger and gases from the #2 and #3 cylinders to the other side of the turbocharger.  

<b>Full Synthetic ONLY!</b>
The engine is filled with Mobil 1 10W-30 full synthetic oil from the factory.  There are notes on stickers placed all over the engine bay (even on the oil cap itself!) and owners manual explaining that the car can only use full synthetic oil, preferably Mobil 1 10W-30.  I know I don't want my engine to explode, so I'll comply without question.  I want only the best for my baby!

<b>Rev Me Baby!</b>
This engine revs to redline (7000 rpm) with an urgency previously reserved for racing engines.  The turbocharger spools up instantly and feeds the engine with 19.5 psi of boost (STOCK, WHOA!!!) without any noticeable turbo lag. (Turbo lag occurs when the turbocharger takes a long time to spin up, thus delaying the boost being fed to the engine's intake, therefore creating a large dead spot in the lower end of the powerband.  Many early Porsche 911 Turbos suffered from this, along with most turbo-engined economy cars.)

<b>The Inner...</b>
The interior of the car is a bit of a letdown.  Apart from the absolutely wonderful stock suede-trimmed Recaro bucket seats and the MOMO steering wheel, the interior is very bland and cheap-looking.  It is essentially the interior of the run-of-the-mill econocar-for-the-masses Lancer. If it weren't for the great seats and the sweet-looking aftermarket MOMO wheel, I'd absolutely hate the interior.  It's very plastic-y and honestly doesn't fit together very well.  The A-pillar and B-pillar paneling rattles when driving on rough roads or playing loud music.  The stock floormats are cheap, and despite being nicely embroidered with "Evolution VIII" they've been summarily relegated to the trunk and replaced with rubber easy-to-clean mats.  The cupholders (two of them) are smallish.  Don't get the Super Size or Great Biggie size Coke and expect it to fit in the cupholder.

<b>I want to purchase stock in Recaro!</b>
The seats are the most comfortable car seats I've ever had the pleasure to sit in.  They hug your butt, your midsection and your shoulders.  They provide plenty of support for people with bad backs.  Mine hasn't screamed in agony once.  The seating position is fairly upright (think race car) but still comfortable.  They have a forward-and-back sliding adjustment, released by a lever on the front of the seat bottom.  They have a forward and back tilt adjustment as well, actuated by a smallish handwheel on the left side of the seatback.

<b>The Momo wheel...</b>
The steering wheel, a genuine Momo leather-wrapped wheel with steel spokes and an airbag fitted to the center, is very comfortable to hold tightly.  It has small bulges where your hands are supposed to grasp it (at 10:00 and 3:00, don't remember Driver's Ed??).  It has a small but noticeable MOMO logo on the bottom spoke.  Just a little bit of added flair.

<b>The horrible dash...</b>
The dashboard...oh the dash and gauge cluster.  It is truly hideous.  The gauges are all red-on-black and are quite hard to read in the daytime, and they're not exactly bright at night either.  The tachometer takes center stage in the gauge cluster with the speedo to the left and temperature and fuel gauges to the right. Also located in the small cluster of three holes for the temp and fuel gauges is a blank gauge that just says "LANCER".  Totally lame.  This car isn't just a freakin Lancer.  It would be better if it said EVOLUTION VIII.  The gauge cluster just plain sucks.  Big thumbs down on that one.

<b>Buttons and the coolest gizmo!</b>
On the lefthand side of the dashboard you'll find the foglight on-off button mounted high, next to the gauges.  Lower, you'll find the dimmer wheel and one of the neatest gadgets on the car:  a manually adjustable headlight leveling switch!  Turn this dial to one of it's four positions and the High Intensity Discharge Xenon headlights will swivel from high to low.  

<b>Adjust thy aim, oh guiding light!</b>
The lowest setting projects the beam about 15 feet in front of the car.  The highest setting lights up the world.  They're not as high as the high beams, but if I'm behind another car in traffic and switch them all the way up, the top of the beam is about even with middle of the trunk of the car in front of me.  Sometimes I drive around with them on the highest setting (because I like to see) and haven't had anyone flash me thinking I've got my high beams on.  Maybe they're not as high as they look!

<b>How to fill with gas and luggage...</b>
Next to the seat on the floor are the normal gas lid and trunk lid release levers.  Nothing new here.  Located just behind the gearshift lever and ahead of the cupholders is the switch for the Intercooler Water Spray, with a choice of "Manual" or "Auto".  I'll discuss this a bit later.

<b>CD Player</b>
The stereo is a generic Mitsubishi CD/AM/FM single-DIN unit.  It gives good sound for a stock radio, but nothing spectacular.  If any of you have driven a Toyota and used it's radio, you'd probably feel right at home using this one.  No special options, no nothing.  Just music.

<b>The Rear...</b>
The backseat is plenty roomy, and to prove it I drove my mother and grandmother to Annapolis, Maryland (3-4 hours by car) for a weekend.  If there's something wrong or someone is uncomfortable, I usually hear about it immediately.  Not this time, not a peep.  I was stunned.  The back seat has the same suede-covered look as the front seats, but there's just a bench seat in the back.  There is no pass-through to the backseat, which kinda stinks, but there is a fold-down armrest/cupholder instead.  After a little investigation in the trunk (removing an interior panel) I discovered why there is no trunk pass-through.  There is a huge structural brace behind the back seat, forming a big X right where the pass-through would normally be located.  Oh well, I guess the Evo loses a couple of practicality points, but who really cares anyway?

<b>The Outer...</b>
Even though this is a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, it doesn't share much with the econocar $14,999 Lancer.  The basic frame is shared, but that's where the similarities end.  The doors, fenders, hood, trunk, rocker panels, front and rear bumpers, headlights, taillights and grill are all genuinely Evolution parts.  

<b>*snicker snicker* Heh, heh, look, he's got a huge...WING!</b>
The first thing people notice on the outside is the ridiculously huge helicopter wing mounted on the back.  The wing is made from Carbon Fiber, a high-tech material which is 1/20th the weight of steel and three times as strong.  Most professional race cars use carbon fiber religiously due to it's high performance and low weight.  This carbon fiber wing is purely for looks, unless I did a top-speed run (which I don't do).  At high speed, I'm sure it does have an effect on downforce, but surely not at 70mph on the local interstate.  

<b>Wing it...or don't</b>
The wing has body-colored endplates and a large, airfoil-shaped wing in between them.  I don't particularly like the big wing, but Mitsubishi sells a smaller, non-carbon fiber wing as an option, and I think the big wing looks better than the small one.  I am constantly ridiculed about the height of the wing.  It isn't as high as the aftermarket aluminum dual-airfoil-element wings I see mounted to Neons and Cavaliers around here though.  It about splits the rearview mirror's view in half.  Driving with it takes a little getting used to but now I barely notice it when I look in the mirror.

<b>What a body...</b>
The hood, front and rear fenders, door panels and trunklid are all made from lightweight aluminum.  It's evident in the doors when you swing them open and shut, there's almost no weight to them at all.

<b>It's full of hot air...</b>
The hood has a large vent in the middle of it with a black mesh screen keeping most debris out of the engine compartment.  This vent has a purpose other than looking kinda neat.  Hot air from the engine compartment is extracted out of this opening by the cold exterior air rushing over the top of it.  This is another trick learned from the World Rally Evolutions.  Sometimes, in cold weather and sitting at a stoplight, you can see the plumes of hot air shooting out of the vent.  It's still not as intimidating as flames shooting from your tailpipes, but it's still pretty neat to look at.

<b>I C the FMIC!</b>
The Evo VIII benefits from a front-mounted intercooler (FMIC) which is stuck into the area of the car which benefits from the highest airflow.  The intercooler looks like a radiator, only smaller.  It has hot compressed air from the turbocharger compressor fed into it, the air is cooled by the "radiator effect" of the FMIC and the cold air hitting the outside of it.  Then this air is fed into the intake of the car.  Intercoolers are essential on turbocharged cars since turbos create a massive amount of heat, and you don't want to be feeding HOT pressurized air into a combustion engine.

<b>Hot blooded...</b>
The intercooler has another cool rally-racing trick installed on it:  a water spray feature, with Manual or Automatic modes.  Small water nozzles are positioned around the intercooler.  A tank in the engine compartment, in the normal location of the windshield washer fluid reservoir, pumps water to the nozzles and sprays down the intercooler, thus forcing it to cool down and preventing dreaded heat soak.  When the manual side of the rocker switch is pressed, the pump is turned on and water is spraying on the intercooler.  When automatic is selected, the engine computer calculates when best to fire the water through the nozzles by measuring throttle position, intake temperature and a host of other readings.  

<b>A bit of a mystery...</b>
No one has fully determined all the parameters that the CPU reads in order to decide when to fire off the water spray.  But hey, it works, so why question it?  A really cool feature for those people who live in extremely hot climates, who race their car (autocross) or live in cities with lots of bumper-to-bumper traffic.

<b>The driving experience of a lifetime...</b>
This car is quick, almost telepathic.  When you want to go, it goes and doesn't ask why.  When you want to turn, one small flick of the wrists and you turn into a corner with amazing stability.  The steering is quite quick on this car, the lock-to-lock turns for this car is 2.7, compared to over 3 for most cars.  It truly feels as if it is on rails.  

<b>Read the mags...</b>
Various car magazines claim 0-60 mph times of 4.7 to 5.0 seconds.  The car is totally capable of those times, but if you want to prove them right, get ready to replace the clutch.  Acceleration runs require hard launches with engine RPM in excess of 5000 thanks to the all-wheel drive.  This puts an amazing amount of stress on the clutch, and there have been numerous people who've experienced clutch failure after a few thousand miles thanks to launching the car on a regular basis.

<b>Hair of the dog...</b>
The amount of grip this car has is unbelievable.  The tires are sticky and sweet, and the Evo VIII plants itself in corners with voracity.  This car hits corners as if it were a guard dog, and you are it's master.  The car will bite into the road and not let go until you tell it to.  In wet weather the car doesn't bite as hard, but I haven't had a single scare in wet weather.  However, if snow is in the forecast, I'm finding a ride into work.  The wide tires just won't cut it on slushy/frozen roads.

<b>And I'm spent...</b>
I think I've let this one go on long enough, so I'm going to sum it up with a list of pros and cons.  I know Epinions gives a list of pros and cons and the top of the review, but I can't possibly fit them all into the 15 word maximum.  By now you've probably figured out that I'm too word-y for the limits of Epinions!  Enjoy.

<b><i>Pros</i></b>
1. <b>Ultimate bang for the buck</b>
2. <b>People stare</b> at it constantly - Attention can be flattering.
3. <b>Steering</b> - tight and quick.  Amazing feel.
4. <b>Brakes (Brembo)</b> - the best you can get, period.  Stops in a heartbeat from any speed.
5. <b>Engine</b> - Rally technology hits US highways, finally.  Only took 12 years to get here.
6. <b>Seats (Recaro)</b> - Comfortable and supportive, even for my wide body.
7. <b>Back seat</b> - It has one, and people can sit in it, comfortably!
8. <b>All-wheel drive</b> - Confidence inspiring grip and stability.
9. <b>HID headlights</b> - light up the world or the road 15 feet in front of you thanks to the manual leveling feature.
10. <b>The big wing</b> - Made from carbon fiber, it's still growing on me.  I think it looks stupid, but carbon fiber is cool!
11. <b>Tires</b> - Yokohama Advan A-046 give infinite grip in dry and wet weather, but don't try them in the snow.
12. <b>Gadgets</b> - Intercooler water spray, manual headlight leveling...fun to play with.
13. <b>Beats the Ferrari Enzo!</b> -  In Road and Track's 60-0 mph braking tests, the Evo is the only production car which stops faster than the Enzo.  108 feet (Evo) vs. 109 feet (Enzo).  Quite a feat! 

<b><i>Cons</i></b>
1. <b>Dealership Price Gouging</b> - Don't give in.  Get it at invoice or find another dealer.  $8,000 to $10,000 markups are not unheard-of on this car!
2. Some consider it <b>ugly.</b>  
3. The <b>big wing</b> looks ridiculous.  It's way too big.
4. Rice-boy comments/snickering/pointing/<b>"2Fast2Furious"</b> references will follow you as long as you own the car.
5. <b>People stare at it.</b>  Gets old after while.
6. <b>Fuel mileage</b> - I get roughly 16 miles per gallon.  Not the best, but what do you want for an all-wheel-drive sports car?
7. Needs a <b>bigger fuel tank</b> - See above.  5 or 6 gallons would help immensely.
8. <b>Tires are noisy.</b>  They're basically racing slicks with grooves cut into them.  No snowy-weather grip.
9. <b>No fold-down seats</b> - Thank the extra structural bracing behind the back seat.
10.  Uses <b>fully synthetic Mobil 1 oil.</b>  Oil changes are pricey thanks to this.
