Toyota has moved the sedan for the masses slightly up market. The new Camry offers more features for about the same price as last years model.  The Camry is now available in an SE model, designed to be the �sporty� Camry if such a thing could ever exist.  The base 4-cylinder engine has increased power, now 157 hp. For those keeping score at home, that�s 24 more than last year�s Camry 4 banger.  The 3.0 liter V6 is still available as an option. Features abound inside the �02 Camry as well. Such luxuries as climate control, driver information center, Homelink, auto-dimming rear view mirror, air filtration, daytime running lights that can be switched off, tilt steering wheel, and wood trim are now standard features on the XLE. Power adjustable pedals will be available later in the model year.  The Camry can also be ordered with Toyota�s VSC skid control and a DVD based navigation system. All this luxury in a Toyota? If a smart shopper didn�t care about having a big �L� on the steering wheel, he or she could save some money by not buying a Lexus ES300, and choosing a Camry XLE instead.

The previous generation Camry was a good car, but the new for 2002 Camry is better in so many ways.  Firstly, the new Camry is a better looking, more boldly styled car.  The wide, flat trunk is attractive, as it the slightly chiseled �swoosh� along the side, and the steeply raked rear window gives the car a sporty flair when viewed from behind.  Secondly, the interior is equally attractive, especially in XLE form where wood, leather and chrome all conspire to fool the driver into thinking this is much more than a mere Toyota. 

The dash is arranged in an ergonomically friendly, yet odd looking manner.  The gauges are all within easy sight for the driver, and the switchgear has a typical Toyota quality feel to it, but the HVAC and audio controls are arranged in a sort of pod-like configuration near the center of the dash. Although similar in theory to that of the Ford Taurus, the execution is all Toyota.  You�d think this ergonomic perfection would translate to ease of use, and yet some controls are confusing. Sure, they fall to hand nicely, but some of the knobs control more than one feature.  I am simply not a fan of the types of audio controls that perform one function for, say, the tape player, but then perform a totally separate function for the CD player � and the only way you know the function is different is from an electronic display. Audi is one of the main offenders in this area, Toyota is usually so much better. Also, there is a driver�s information center that displays in a location most drivers will surely associate with the clock � center dash, just above the stereo.  Even though the driver�s information center is a welcome addition (GM�s been offering this feature for years),  but the display area needs to be bigger and more functions should be displayed.  The interior of the new Camry is a pleasant place to spend lots of time, but this is nothing new for Toyota. In fact most Japanese cars seem to have a warmer, friendlier interior than their European counterparts.  

Given the upscale look and feel of the Camry�s interior, one would expect a more upscale audio system.  It is certainly not a bad system by any measure, but the stereo sounds somewhat flat a times.  Perhaps the luxury car look, or the library like quietness of  the cabin causes one to have elevated expectations. 

On the road the new Camry feels even softer and, again, more luxurious (notice a theme?) than the previous year�s Camry.  There is little road or wind noise.  Soft as the Camry�s ride is, it lacks that detached, floating feeling  found on some American cars.  Driving on rough roads give the distinct impression that Toyota engineers have replaced some suspension components with large pillows.  Cornering at moderate speeds results in some body roll. Previous Camrys have never been canyon carving street racers, but the 2002 version feels especially prone to leaning in the corners. Steering is light and responsive at low speeds, yet allows the driver some road feel at higher speeds. Luckily Toyota is offering an SE model for the first time.  If you want some sport with your luxury, skip the XLE and consider the SE instead.  The only thing that seems to not be new for the �02 Camry is the optional V6 engine.  This year�s Camry is a heavier car, but will have to make due with 2 fewer horsepower when equipped with the silky smooth six. Acceleration from the V6 with an automatic transmission is lack luster at best.  The Camry Solara has 200 hp, cousin to the Camry, the Lexus ES300 makes 205 hp.  Why does a car that is such a huge improvement over the previous model have to make due with 192 hp?  The less expensive Nissan Altima SE 3.5, produces 240 hp, and the Maxima makes an impressive 255.  Yes, the new Camry is purposely more luxurious than any Camry before it, but can�t luxury include power too?? Although it may be slightly down on power, no one could find reason to complain about the V6�s refinement. This is a wonderfully smooth and quiet engine. The four cam, 3.0 liter V6 only makes its presence known when pressed hard, even thought there�s not much power behind it, the sound is quite nice, sort of a controlled growl

Overall, the 2002 Toyota Camry is a really, really good car, perhaps not great, but really good. High points include a more distinct and boldly styled exterior, as well as Lexus like interior and a more powerful 4 cylinder engine.  The Camry still represents somewhat of a value as 2002 model prices are about the same as 2001 model year prices. Even though the price can be higher (when ordered with optional equipment), value has gone up as well, you get a lot more stuff for your money.  The main, and perhaps only miss for the new Camry is the 192 hp V6, while redesigning the entire car, why not add 10 horses or so.  If brisk acceleration does not impress you, you�ll likely find a near perfect sedan in the new Camry.
