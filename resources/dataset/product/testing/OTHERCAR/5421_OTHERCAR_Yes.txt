            This camera is the greatest for the price.  It rivals the more expensive camera's in quality and features.  I had originally ordered another brand off a cable shopping network and was VERY disappointed when I received it.  The quality was very, very poor and it had very few features.

The canon Power Shot has zoom, macro, auto flash even a timer so you can appear in your own photos.  

I use mine mainly for putting items on eBay, but have had great fun taking it on trips and emailing the photos the moment I get home.  I was at the Statue of Liberty and drew a crowd to see the picture on the full color LCD viewfinder and ended up taking pictures of strangers to e-mail to them.

If you want a great camera at a great price, then take a look at the Canon Power shot a5.

The only negative thing I could say about this is that it does not act as a video camera for the web.<br><br>
