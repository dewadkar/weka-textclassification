            Growing up, my parents always drove a Honda.  The only thing that ever changed was the color.  As a family, we traveled constantly.  Cross country trips, trips into Canada, historical marking trips....we were always comfortable and I can never remember a time where we broke down or needed repairs.  

As I grew older, and my peers started talking about cars...the only car that I had in my mind was the Honda Civic.  When I got my first job as a High School Teacher, my first real purchase was a 1999 black Honda Civic DX (two door).  The gas mileage is incredible, it's sporty enough so that I'm the &quot;cool teacher&quot; who drives the &quot;cool car,&quot; and it's extremely reliable.  The Honda dealership is extremely helpful and I go in for regular oil changes and tune-ups when I can.  

The driving of the vehicle is extremely smooth and as I drive a standard, the power behind it is also very high.  The only thing that isn't up to par for some of my taller friends is the roof room.  If you are taller then 6 feet...this car is not a comfortable one for you to be in.  

Not only is the Honda Civic an affordable car to own but it is also one of those cars whose resale value is worth the years you drive it.  My car, when I choose to trade it in for another Honda, will be worth more then most any car that you can buy on today's market.  The resale value is a wonderful thing to look forward to and the car itself is a miracle on wheels.  If you are looking for a car that gets good gas mileage, is reliable, looks good, and gets you where you need to go at a cheap price, the Honda Civic is the way to go. <br><br>
