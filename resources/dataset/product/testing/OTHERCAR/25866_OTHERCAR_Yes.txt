            I decided to buy my jeep cherokee 2dr 4wd inline 6 cylinder because i have been waiting for jeep to make the 6 cylinder with a five speed transmission.  I ordered my jeep in december of 1999.  I ended up waiting six months for the delivery of my jeep.  And was it worth it.  I have had my jeep for about three weeks and i could not be happier.  I love the low end torque and the appearance of my jeep.  The only criticism that i have of the jeep is the high end torque when climbing steep mountains at speeds above 75 mph.  At these speeds it is somewhat sluggish, but then again jeep is designed to climb hills at low speeds, so a fair trade off.  Anyone in the market for this type of jeep should consider the other SUVs closely.  I bought this jeep because, for the price, you get the most and it is a JEEP.  I recommend one for people who love to camp and go off the betten path, and discourage those who will drive it mainly on the road - get a car.<br><br>
