            <i>Hello all</i>


<b>My EX Integra:</b>

Don�t have the Integra anymore but I still miss it until this day. I had three cars since I sold my 1991 Acura Integra RS Sedan for financial reasons. I have owned it roughly two years, but when I went to college and I had to pay for my studies, the baby had to go. I loved that car. I had a 91-Colt right after. Worst car I ever owned! Than a 95 Honda Civic SI Coupe, 5-speed, and right now I own a 98 Corolla VE Automatic. My Integra had no Air conditioning nor alloy wheels nor any of the fancy stuff that the LS, GS, or GSR has, however it was still a beautiful, shiny car with new Bridgestone Potenza tires on it.


<b>Basic specs:</b>

All Acura Integras from 1990 to 1993 have the same 1.8 Liter DOHC = Double Over Head Cam engines and they are all multi port fuel injection with 16-valve 140-Bhp, front wheel drive except the GS-R which has a more powerful engine but the same size, 1.8 L. The RS is the base model in the Integra line. Theses cars were made in two body styles. A two door lift-back and a four door sedans. Mine was a four door sedan with automatic transmission. I had no Air conditioning nor power windows. The only power option was in my car is the Power mirror adjuster. This is besides the standard power steering which can be found in all Integras regardless of the model or year.
I had the factory radio taken out and had a Clarion CD Player installed in the dash. I had tinted glass and very low mileage on the car. It was all original paint until someone broke into it and damaged the locks on both sides and on the trunk as well.


<b>Annoyances:</b>

There were a few things I thought should be somehow improved on this model. The most annoying thing was the window. All doors on these cars are frame less. This means that when you close the door on an Integra there is nothing holding the top of the glass. This creates allot of wind noise when traveling on higher speeds on the freeway/highway, etc. The new Integras from 94 don�t have this. They improved it due to allot of complains from owners. Acura made other cars with the same style frame-less side windows, like the Vigor and the Legend. Some of their new models also have this, like the CL and the TL models. So this was the most annoying for me, plus we live in Canada where is very cold in the Winter time. At numerous accasions the doors/windows just wouldn�t close properly because of the ice and snow on the frames. One more thing I didn�t like was the back shifting of the automatic transmission when slowing down with the car. It would also violently back shift at lower speeds when I stepped on the accelerator. I asked other Acura owners and they all say the same thing about the frame-less windows.


<b>The beauty part:</b>

My car was a family sedan but it handled like a true sports car. I could easily pass 5-L Mustangs in sharp curves because this car is so stable on the road. Mine was not lowered or had no race tires, just a good set of Bridgestone Potenza low profile tires with allot of tread on them. These tires did the job every time. Dry, rain, snow, ice, mud. They hold your car and you in it firmly to the road and they are also very quiet. I highly recommend the Bridgestone Potenza tires for people who like control. I also loved the Interior of the car. It was very tasteful and it had allot room inside. Even at the back. The trunk was huge and the seats were very comfortable. The engine is very powerful, 140-Bhp. It felt like a 160 hp V-6 sometimes however it is a very revving engine. To produce that much power, the engine has to rev at least 5000 Rpm. The car could use a bit more torque. Over all it�s a beautiful car to drive and own.


<b>Summary:</b>

I highly recommend this car to people who can�t afford new cars, just want something with power and style backed up by a name ACURA.
This car will serve you for a long time. It is virtually trouble and maintenance free. It�s also good on gas and it�s allot of fun to drive. You will look forward driving it on a daily basis. The engine never overheats and the car will start, no matter how cold is it outside. I am thinking to replace my Toyota corolla with a bigger car like the Maxima or BMW but my heart still pulls me back to all those nice memories with my Integra. <b>Enjoy!
