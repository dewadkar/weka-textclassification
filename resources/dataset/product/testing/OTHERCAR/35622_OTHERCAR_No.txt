              I leased a 1998 Chevy Malibu. When we were looking we wanted a Camry. They didn't have anything we like. We then decided to check out the new Malibu. I loved the car. Great price, roomy, very comfortable, and a V-6. 

  That was then. And now, two and a half years later I can't wait for my lease to be up. It has been in several times for break repairs, there is a lot of road noise, and the McPhearson struts are shot. I have just recently hit 50,000 miles and personally feel the car should be doing better than it is. This is supposed to be a good reliable family car. And the worst part is I recommended the car to a friend and he bought one. He has had the same break problems. He is currently looking to buy a new Camry.

  Needless to say, when my lease is up I will be throwing a party. Right after I get my new Camry.
