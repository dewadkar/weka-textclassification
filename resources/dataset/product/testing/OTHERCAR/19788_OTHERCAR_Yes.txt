            I've had a look at the other reviews here, and it's been an education.  It was good to know that the same things happen to '96 Golfs pretty regularly.  Still, it's not a bad car.

I bought mine new in the Fall of '95.  At the time, the dealership was very friendly and professional.  More about that later.  I got the model with the standard 4-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual transmission, and nothing fancy.  I wanted a good, dependable city commute car that could infrequently make a longer road trip.

Immediately, I loved the responsive Volkswagen gear ratios.  For a four-cylinder engine, it has a lot of pickup.  Everything went well for about the first three years of operation.  Nothing broke or otherwise fell off.

In the fourth year, the rubber side moldings began to peal from the doors rearward.  I went to the auto parts store and bought a tube of trim glue and that fixed the problem.  I still have the tube in case another piece decides to come loose.  You should also pay close attention to the battery.  When the original battery went, it was hard to diagnose the problem. (Usually, we know the battery is dead because the car won't start.  This one's different.)  I was sitting in the car at night, engine off, waiting for my daughter to get out of her Girl Scout meeting.  Suddenly, a clicking noise began behind the dash.  The lights (interior and exterior) began to flash in time with the clicking.  You want to see a guy quickly exit a vehicle?  I never would have thought the battery was the problem.  The dealer was happy to replace mine for $170.  They didn't mind taking advantage of their customer one bit.

At around 50,000 miles, the throttle body (whatever that is) cracked, causing me to lose power while coming up the approach to a large bridge.  That was loads of fun.  And, the timing belt snapped while turning a corner on a downtown street.  Each repair cost around $600 at the "friendly" dealer.  Other reviewers are right:  many parts are still only available at the dealer even at the six-year mark.  Volkswagen, it seems, will not sell the diagnostic package to private repair shops, so unless it's radiator hoses, belts, or the easy stuff, you won't get it fixed at your neighborhood shop.

The rubber molding around the hatch and the windshield needs replacement.  The rear hatch interior gets damp after a heavy rain.  As a result, the electric door locks have also failed.  This is tough when you want to fill the gas tank.  The instructions in the manual are worthless as the procedure for opening the locked gas filler door has nothing to do with the actual equipment.  (A Swiss Army knife works well.)

Even so, I can't call this car a "lemon."  It's been very dependable for me even though I'm not the best about preventive maintenance. It still gets about 28MPG on average and still passes my state's emission tests with no problems.

Just keep a tube of trim glue handy.
