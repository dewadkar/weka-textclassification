            A small tropical island in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean might sound like paradise but running a daily newspaper on one is just the opposite. Never mind the politics - the hard part is finding equipment that can stand up being handled by journalists who surely must have been bulldozers in a previous existence. 
Don't get me wrong, I love them dearly but when it comes to technology they're ham-fisted klutzes.
Their ideal picture-taker would be a cast-iron pinhole camera but unfortunately the shutter speed would leave a lot to be desired. 
About four years ago Olympus entered the digital camera market with the precursor of the D360L - the 300L. We snapped one up and apart from the lithium battery holder disappearing after a week and the resulting hole having to be taped over, it served us faithfully until early this year. The crucial ingredient was no protruding parts. There was nothing to break off or bend or get left behind.
When it finally bit the dust we decided to get another. Two in fact.
It's taken a while to find a supplier who a) had the current version D360L in stock and b) ships overseas, but thanks to epinions' 'where to buy' box they finally arrived. 
They're wonderful.
Point and shoot is great for mugshots, award presentations and groups which is what the majority of pictures in community newspapers consist of. And everywhere else come to think of it. 
But while the D360L makes snapshotting easy, it also has an range of additional features for those who want to get more adventurous. The optional spot-metering and exposure compensation mean, theoretically, that silhouetted heads against bright window backgrounds need never be seen again!. I'll believe that when it happens. Or doesn't as the case may be.
The burst function (a motor-drive effect) looks like being fun and the ability to effectively change the 'film speed' up to 500ASA will certainly be useful. There is a 2x enlargement option which Olympus calls a digital zoom but it's fiddly to use and generally it is going to be easier to move in closer to the subject. Better exercise too. Digital cameras with zooms are usually several hundred dollars more expensive and also have more moving parts - not a good idea for our band of users.
There are 5 different quality levels although the difference between, for example, 'high' and 'standard high' are not altogether clear at first glance. 
As well as the usual selection of flash options (auto, fill. red-eye) there's a 'slow' flash option which the manual says is good for night shots. We don't have much in the way of street lights here but it could be worth trying at clubs and dances. 
Physically the camera is small and solid. It will fit easily into a jacket pocket but not tight jeans. The case is silver coloured plastic which lasts well when used by one careful person. In our case I expect the silver finish to start wearing off after while but the camera will still operate even if the surface is black. These cameras are going to get a great deal of use by a number of different people. 
If they work as well as their predecessor we will be extremely pleased.
