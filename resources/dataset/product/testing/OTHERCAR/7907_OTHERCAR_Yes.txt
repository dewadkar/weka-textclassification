            The A20 was my first digital camera, and I really liked it.  I now have a Canon S40 also.  

Body:

I consider the shape of this camera, perfect.  My Canon S40 is smaller, but do I really want a camera that is smaller?  Not really!  The A20 has a great right-handed grip so you won't worry about dropping it.  The controls are all in natural places for true one hand operations.  

Function:

Pretty much point and shoot. There are adjustments possible, but I'm not one to use them.  I just set it on auto and shoot.  I want to get the shot, I don't want to miss it fiddling around with exposure settings!  The low - battery warning light sometimes comes on when there's still some juice left.  But, that really didn't bother me too much.  

Cost and Comparisons:

I think it's very well priced.  The A40 is supposed the replacement for the A20 as it has a movie recording feature.  I cannot comment on the A40, since I have not tried it.  I would venture to say that for the price, I would definitely go with an A20 versus a S40.  Don't confuse the A40 with S40. The S40 is a higher-end model.  The A40 looks similar to A20, but it is grey and has some movie features.  For the price, I actually liked the A20 over my S40.
