            I leased A 1999 Kia Sportage 2-Door Convertible 4x2 In July Of 1999.  I Bought The Truck Because I Did A Lot Of Comparison Shopping, And Almost All Of The Time It Could Not Be Beaten For The Price.  Versus The Crv, It Has The Same Ground Clearance, More Horsepower, An Available Convertible, And In My Opinion A Much More Comfortable Interior, And All For Around 2 To 4 Thousand Dollars Less.  The same goes For the Rav-4.  
Now For the Lemon Part.  Since I've Bought It In July, I've Found My Self Stranded In Downtown Philadelphia When A Hose On The Radiator Blew Coolant All Over The Street And The Engine Compartment, The Cigarette Lighter Pulled Right Out Of The Dash Board While Unplugging My Cell Phone, I've Also Had The Weather-stripping On Both Front Windows Fall Off, The Rear Convertible Window Doesn't Attach Tight In The Back And Flaps Open All Of The Time, The Transmission Slips Once Every Few Days, It Jumps Out Of Gear For A Second And Then Slams Back Into Gear, But It Only Does It Every Few Days, So Of Course It Doesn't Do It For The Mechanics.
At First I Loved The Truck, It Was Nice Looking, Sounds Great With A Performance Exhaust, It Was Affordable, And The Standard Features Were Unbeatable.  However Try Not To Get Stuck In A Bad One.  I don't know if I Am Just One of the Unlucky Ones, But You Won't Catch Me Buying Another One.
