            I bought a used 1994 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE with about 60,000 miles on it. I needed this car due to room I needed to carry and haul stuff around. 


Love:
The power the engine has. It has a 3.3 V6 which does very well when entering onto the freeway and going up hills. This is only when the transmission is working right!

The room inside the van is a +.

I got hit on the right drivers door with about $1,000.00 dollars worth of damage. I came out with no injures.

Hate:
The transmission is the #1 thing I hate about this van, I had to replace it 3 times!!!!! The good thing is that all the repairs were under warranty. 

Tha brakes are good has of right now,I hear funny noise allot of times when I hit the brakes.

The air condition keeps going out allot! I had it fixed and it lasted 2 days. I just kept getting it fixed,but I now have given up.

I would not recommend this van to anyone... You can buy something 20000% better.
