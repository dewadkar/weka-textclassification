            We have owned (actually, leased) a 2000 Camry LE identical in color and style to the one in the picture above for about two months and are very satisfied with it. 

We had the chance to buy any car in its price range, including a Volvo and a Passat, but are glad we went for the Camry. Not only that, we were able to negotiate a good price on the lease by looking through the ads in the LA Times and finding a good deal, and then calling a local dealer to see if they would match the price. 

It seems that according to the recent Auto issue of Consumer Reports,  Camrys and, believe it or not, Accords, have a larger margin for negotiation than many other good cars out there. The end result was a great car for a great price.

The LE 4 was an easy car to find a deal on, I believe, because it is so popular. And rightfully so. It is somewhat luxurious and its styling is unoffensive. The Japanese sensibility is apparent throughout. Its ride is smooth and vibrationless, much like you would expect in a Lexus, which, as I understand it, uses the same frame. The noise level inside the car is surprisingly low, which allows us to hear much more of the music we play over the standard CD player. The A/C and other accessories work like a charm. The fit and finish of our Japanese made Camry (note that some are made in the US) rivals any car we tested, including the Passat. I also drove a Concorde for a week after our last car was totalled and the comfort of the Camry rivals it, too; don't forget that the price of the Camry is substantially lower and the reliability and quality is substantially higher.

The 2000 Camry is a world of difference between the 1974 Corolla I first owned and drove in Japan almost 20 years ago. I would be foolish if I bought anything but a Japanese car again, even today; the Camry is the best of the lot. <br><br>
