            Having to replace my crash-totaled car, I looked around for a comfortable, econmical and dependable vehicle.  After test-driving the Camry, I stopped looking.  I purchased a 1993 LE V6 with power moonroof.  This car is exceptionally quiet, both in town and on the open road.  The dependability claims by Toyota has been proven true with only routine and scheduled maintenance.  Although it has power steering, road-feel is not lost and although not a sports car (I also own a  1991 Celica GT) it is fun to drive.  Being 6'2&quot; and 210 lbs, I am very comfortable in both the driver's and passenger seats.<br><br>
