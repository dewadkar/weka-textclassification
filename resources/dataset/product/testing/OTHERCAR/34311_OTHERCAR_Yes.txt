            And you couldn't find such quality along with that value at Wal-Mart either! This car's standard list would rival that of some other car manufacturer's OPTIONS list. This car is based on Honda's global midsize platform, which they also use for the Accord. The engine is also borrowed from the Accord, taking the 3.0 V6 and increasing the displacement to 3.2 Liters. With all this 'borrowing' from the Accord, why not get the Accord instead you ask? Well, let's see shall we? 

First you start off with a very capable 3.2 Liter V6 with VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) which produces 225 HP @ 5500RPM's and 216lb-ft of torque at 5000RPM's. Now, that all sounds nifty, but what does it do? Well...it sets the TL going off to 60mph in approximately 7.4 seconds. Okay, an Accord V6 can just about do that too, so where's the big difference? Well...it might not be here in the engine that sets the TL apart from the Accord. Believe me, there are plenty more reasons the TL is different and unique.

Look at the seemingly endless list of standard equipment on this TL and you'll see where the value comes in. There's standard leather seats, options on many other luxury vehicles, sometimes running up to $1000 for them. Not only are the seats leather, but they're heated (front seats) too! I've heard that in the 2000 TL, the passenger side does not heat up where your back rests, they say this is due to the side airbags (sensors) which are also now standard on 2000 TL's. Comfort? You bet! Set it and forget it, you'll easily feel relaxed with the support they give. I am almost 6' and honestly, it is kind of hard to get it at that perfect spot but once you find it, oh boy, if it wasn't for the 180 watt, 5-speaker, Acura/Bose sound system sounding off, I'd probably fall asleep. Being over 6 foot might cause some troubles with the seat setting, be sure to test it all out at the dealership. The driver's side is 8-way adjustable and the passenger is 4-way, I would have preferred both to have been 8-way, but at least the more important side (the driver!) got more movement to adjust. 

As stated, the sound system is wonderful, created in a joint effort by Acura and Bose. There are 5 speakers, two in the front door, two in the rear doors and a 90-watt subwoofer on the rear platform where the brake light is. It's not overbearing, but it's not weak either. The sound is very crisp and clear, not too much, not too little. Definitely a work of art, beautiful job by Acura and Bose. 

Xenon headlights (standard) create such illumination at night that you'll wonder why would you ever drive with halogen headlights ever again. An option on many other more expensive luxury cars, usually running around $500 and up, xenon technology definitely adds so much more visibility at night. Whenever I drive one of our other cars with halogens, it's just night and day compared to the xenon's. Being used to the xenon's now, I almost strain to see with the halogen's, it's just that much better. I love the xenon's with their white-blue effect, brightening the road ahead of me. Of course, many other drivers seem to have a problem with these lights, they seem to think my high-beams are on! Be careful with aiming these lights if you ever need to re-align them, but this just goes to show you how wonderful these xenon's are. 

The interior is very ergonomically correct and just about perfect. Everything is in reach, the automatic climate controls, the radio (which controls are also set on the steering wheel), and the Navigation controls all with little to no stretching involved. The rear seats are roomy, although, being 6' or taller might create some problems for the person sitting behind the driver. The trunk is spacious, I believe about 14.3 cubic feet of space to be exact. The exterior is, as many Honda designed cars are, very conservative. Although conservative it still is very beautiful in my opinion and really has a sporty flair to it. My TL has an added rear spoiler which I think only adds to the sporty look of the car.

As you can see, there is just so much to the TL, I could probably go on and on, but in the interest of saving you time and having you stop reading to go test one yourself, I'll just end with a quick recap of the standard options and highlights of the car. The standard list includes: Xenon High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights, 5-speaker 180watt Acura/Bose sound system, leather seating, heated front seats, automatically dimming rear view mirror, heated side mirrors, automatic climate control, auto-off headlights, 4speed Sportshift automatic transmission (2000 TL's have upgraded to a 5speed), 16in. wheels, moonroof, traction control, two speed intermittent wipers, keyless entry..etc..etc. The one and only option available for the TL is a CD (DVD based for 2000 TL's) based navigation system. 

Driving this vehicle isn't a chore, even when you're out doing chores. I look forward to driving this car! Running errands, going to school, whatever it is, I can't wait to get into the car and starting it up and  taking it through the turns and stoplights. My only complaint so far with the car is some creaking noise in the driver's side seat. Other than that, I have not had any problems with the vehicle and it's been one of the most non-regretful purchases I have ever made. For about $30,000, getting all this standard equipment on any other vehicle would be near impossible, you just can't beat such a value. Acura's dependability with a long list of standard equipment and one sole option, DVD Navigation (which by the way, only adds around $2000 to the final price, a value for navigation systems), it makes you wonder why buy anything else? If you're looking to get the most out of your money this is definitely one car you should not pass up! <br><br>
