            Everyone told me not to buy the avenger because I was planning on starting a family and it wouldn't be practical.  They were wrong, wrong, wrong.
I bought the car because it was affordable and sporty but it is much more than that.

I have had it for three years and the only thing I must warn you about is the front bumper.  It is very low and get scratched up really easily.  I keep a tube of white car paint to fix it up.

There is one more disadvantage - the tires and wheel coverings are very expensive to replace!

Other than that, the only thing I have had to fix were the brakes and that is probably due to my driving habits.

The seats are very comfortable and easily adjust any way you want them to. The trunk is huge!  I fit a large stroller in there and an entire load of groceries.  There are two pockets in each door to store things and two storage bins in the middle.  There are also two middle cup holders.

As for the family, I have no problem putting my son into his carseat. 

I would recommend this car for anyone who wants a sporty vehicle at a good price.  <br><br>
