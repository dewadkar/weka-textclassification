            Being a novice to the world of digital cameras, I did a lot of research on all different types and all of the ones that seemed to make sense and whose opinions I trusted, all said that if you couldn't by the one that is consistently talked very highly of, the next excellent choice was the Kodak DC265.  The picture clarity is only surpassed by its ease of use.  It fits very well into the hands of either a man or a woman and takes no real knowledge of photography in order to produce great shots.  Downloading it to the computer is also a snap but I would definitely recommend using the USB connections in order to improve the download time.  You won't be sorry.<br><br>
