            A 1997 Dodge Neon was my first brand new car.  My mistake.

I bought it because it was sporty looking and had excellent gas mileage (34-40 mpg, standard shift.)  The handling was good, compared to what I was driving, and my fiance's sister had one that she loved.

I will say this, the brakes lasted over 60,000 miles.

Within a year, my sister-in-law's car began leaking oil.  Six months after hers, mine did.  When I called the service department, I was told that they all leak oil and it was nothing to worry about.  (Excuse me, but I thought cars needed oil in order to operate!)

When backing up, the trunk was too high to permit good visual of what was behind the car.  The driver's seat was very uncomfortable to anyone over 5' 8".  

Before I could do anything about this problem with the oil leak, my son was run off the road and ran headon into 3000 feet of guardrail and 15 posts.  The airbags did not deploy.  This bothered me a great deal.  (A friend owns a Dodge Durango and his airbags did not deploy when hit headon.)

When I contacted Dodge regarding this problem, they took so long to respond, that the car was towed by the insurance company keeping Dodge from doing an investigation as to why the airbags did not deploy.

The car was so damaged, that everyone who sees pictures wants to know how my son survived.

My sister-in-law purchased a 2000 Dodge Neon just before this accident.  Within a year, that Neon was leaking oil.
