            First of all, excuse me for grammar or others faults in the text, I'm French and my english is not fantastic ! 

Well, I've bought my car one year ago, it was a one year old car. I was searching for a little car, because I was having little money to buy it, but not too old because I was wanting that the car had a long life, so I was looking for one year old car, 25.000 km max. !  I was having a big choice of little cars : most Fiat Punto, Renault Twingo, Peugeot 106 or Seat Ibiza, I don't know if you know them in the U.S.  . Suzuki is not very known in France for Autos but for Motorcycles. Suzuki is not very well considered by French for Autos.

I saw a little car, nice. A 3 Cylinders, 1.0 liter motor (to use with 95 or 98 gas), horsepower  53 : A 99'Suzuki Swift. I tried it and said yes for buy it for about 6.000 $.

One year after, I can gave you my objective opinion about my Swift.

I have got only one little problem with it. It stopped one time during I was driving and the motor didn't restarted : it was a little electrical problem.

Its Desgin (it's not exactly corresponding to the photo on the site, on the site (Epinions, here) it seems to be a old photo, the old model) : its design is modern, but there is other cars which are lovelier for the same price !  But I like the design of my Swift !

Its interior space : for the Driver, me , its ok, for the other it's just ! It'a bit just for a family ! There is some gadgets which are sympatic like a place for drinks, electrical windows... (but no airbags !)

The motor : it takes about 6 liters for 100 kms, so it's very economic ! And it responds well ! A good motor, dynamic even if it's not very powerfull !

The Stability on the road : not exceptional, I'm often driving on low quality roads and it's not very pleasant.
