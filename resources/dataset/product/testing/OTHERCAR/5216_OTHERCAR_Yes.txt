            Let's face it digital cameras are a great idea.  I've used this camera for reports, e-mail pictures, and the (very) occasional printed photograph.  However, digital cameras also have their limitations.  Such as landscapes, any picture taken at a long distance, or a picture you want to remember forever.

Picture Quality:
For close-ups or pictures where the subject fills most of the viewing area the pictures can be great.  The color is good, the contrast is nicely balanced, and the focus is good.  Most any picture taken at close range looks great on screen and in E-Mails.  Printing the picture is a different story.  I realize that the printed results have a lot to do with your printer as well as the camera.  My printer is a Hewlett Packard 882C that yields exceptional results with photo printing.  However, about half of the pictures I print that look clear on screen don't translate as well on paper.  They have good color, but detail leaves much to desire.  Tweaking the picture with image editing software helps that problem somewhat.  No software can help scenery or landscape pictures with fine detail.  Even the most expensive, high end digital camera will not yield excellent landscape pictures.

Ease Of Use:
This camera is one of the easiest to use digital cameras on the market.  I credit that achievement to the dial located on the back.  To switch from play, to record, to delete, to setup, is as easy as turning the dial.  The flash can be set to auto, forced, off, and red-eye.  There is a 10-second self timer.  Transferring the photos to the computer is painless also.  Photos are transferred via cable through the computer's serial port.  Then just turn the dial to computer, and start the transfer software.  The photos can be taken using an optic viewfinder, like a film camera, or with the LCD screen on the back.  USE THE VIEWFINDER the batteries will last a lot longer.

Portability:
This camera is very light without batteries, almost to light.  With the 4AA batteries loaded the camera has a nice solid feel.  It is also remarkably small.  It comes with a wrist strap and a 2MB flash memory card on which the photos are stored. 

Overall:
Digital cameras are a great idea and are quite useful, however, one must be aware of a digital cameras limitations.  They do not replace film cameras yet, but they probably will in the distant future.
