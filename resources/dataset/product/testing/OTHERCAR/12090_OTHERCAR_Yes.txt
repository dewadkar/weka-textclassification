            The Suzuki Grand Vitara has given me some mixed feelings.  I'll give you the bad news first.  The Grand Vitara in my case has had a lot of problems.  In the past year I have lost the controller for the air conditioning, the trim has started to peel off, and there was an electrical problem that kept throwing the fan on while it was parked and turned off.  To top it off, i had 2 oil leaks.  Not exactly my definition of a high quality vehicle.  Good thing i got the extended warranty.  The good news is that the Grand Vitara is a good looking, fun, quiet, comfortable, attractively priced SUV with a nice engine and superior off road capabilities. Aside from the mechanical problems, i really do enjoy driving the vehicle, especially off road.  The 4 wheel drive is great, as is the amount of clearance available to roll over dirt mounds and brush.  Off all the Jeep products and other SUV's i have been in, the Suzuki Grand Vitara is by far the best off road.  On the road, the ride is smooth and quiet with an interior that is spacious and comfortable. Gas mileage on this car is around 350 miles per tank highway, with a little less if i am tearing around the city. Another thing that i like is the size of the vehicle.  I was not interested in large vehicles like the Explorer and the Navigator but did not want something as small as a Wrangler, so this mid size was perfect.  Big enough that you are sitting up higher than the cars, but small enough that you can manuever in parking lots or tight trails. Overall, i would say that the SUV is a good buy.  My experiece with the problems could very well be isolated.  <br><br>
