            I bought a 96' model 626 used last year.  I love it!  I have had no problems with it and I think it handles like a dream. Aside from the highways being full of complete morons it is a relaxing place for me to be. Now I am no mechanic so I do not have a lot of technical reasons why I love it so much, simply that I do. The only negative thing I have to say is that in my city, there is only one Mazda dealership that will honor my warranty so that is a small inconvenience.  I picked mine up as a great deal because it was a lease car that had been turned in for a trade.  It has more pick up power than other cars that I drove in it's class.  <br><br>
