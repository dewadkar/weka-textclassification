            I have owned four Toyota's in my lifetime including my most recent acquisition... a 1994 Toyota Camry.  128 thousand miles, and still purring along.  I recently took a trip of a thousand miles round trip, and my Camry not only got me there and back without a hitch, but at 29 miles per gallon made the trip affordable.  It's V4 engine actually has a great deal of "pick-up".  The seats are comfortable, even with two growing boys in the back seat. The trunk is very roomy and the back seats fold down for more room.  It can seat 5 people very comfortably with seat belts, and we have packed in more in a pinch. My kids and I especially enjoy the sun roof. Its brakes stop on a dime and have helped me out of several touchy situations. My husband is so pleased with my car that he has offered to "allow" me to have the next car we buy as long as he can have the Camry. I've had this car for over a year, and have yet to make any repairs.  I believe in Toyota. I know I will be enjoying this car for several years to come.  My husband can just go find his own Camry!
