            Well, to be perfectly honest, I still need film. I have yet to work with a digital camera that even approaches the resolution currently offered by 35mm film. But the Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C200 certainly outperforms the old "snapshot" cameras.

I currently have three cameras in my arsenal - my trusted old Olympus OM-G, my newer Olympus OM-2000, and the HP C200. The last was a gift from my parents during the holidays, and I've been using it quite a bit.

The camera comes with a rather tiny Compact Flash card - 16MB. By upgrading that (for about $50) to a 48MB CF card, I've got room for over 100 photos in "high" resolution, about 250 in "medium," and about 500 in "low" mode.

I've found that the easiest way to transfer images from the camera to the computer is via a SanDisk USB Compact Flash Card Reader. The pictures appear as if they were on a *really* large floppy disk, and I can open, copy, edit, and delete them just the same. This is a considerable improvement over a serial connection, as the USB interface is much faster.

The images are stored on the Flash card as JPEG graphic files - any decent graphic editor will work with them, or they can be placed "as is" on a website. I don't recommend that, though, as the camera doesn't quite do as much compression as I prefer for JPEGs to be placed on web pages...

Controls are simple. You have the option of autofocus or not, auto-flash or not, red-eye reduction or not, digital 2x zoom, and the ability to view or delete your pictures directly on the camera. There's a built-in self-timer so that you can take pictures automatically ten seconds after pressing the button.

Color reproduction is *much* better on the HP C200 than on the Casio QV100 (reviewed here). I've taken good indoor pictures, better outdoor pictures, and some nice pictures of my dogs. The red-eye reduction doesn't work on dogs or cats, though...

On regular alkaline batteries, I was able to get about 100 or so "high resolution" pictures before the batteries died. Now, I simply use NIMH rechargeables, and carry an extra set of them with me. This has saved me a *lot* of money on batteries so far!

The camera is slightly larger than I'd like, but is still smaller than my "real" cameras. It pauses for a second or two after pressing the button before taking the picture. Image blurring is sometimes a problem if your subject moves after you've pressed the button.

Digital cameras are getting better and cheaper, but they still have a *long* way to go to catch up with film!
