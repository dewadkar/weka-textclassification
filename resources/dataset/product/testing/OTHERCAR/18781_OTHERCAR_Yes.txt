            I recently bought a 97 Kia Sephia. I am pleased with it. I would much rather have a brand spankin' new Ford F-150. But for a starter car this has made me happy. it is really good on fuel and it gets me where I need to go. I had looked around at many other vehicles but all of the ones that I wanted no one ever had anything good to say about them. I have a few friends who own Kia's and they are happy with the way that Kia's ran, and the prices too. The Kia Sephia is reasonably priced. I would recommend this to anyone who is on a fixed income that is looking for their first vehicle or just something to start off in. <br><br>
