            The 4 Runner has got me places for years!  I've taken it for 15 hour non-stop trips a few times.  It has gone through the wicked heat temperatures of the Summer in Death Valley and crazy snow storms from Reno to Truckee.  Uphill, downhill, through traffic, and used to carry cargo from Bakersfield to San Francisco.

This SUV has to be the most versatile car ever!  It has a lot of space in the back for cargo and luggage.  The rear seats sit three huge people quite nicely, even for long trips from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  The driver's seat is made for distance driving with adjustable features for a comfy fit.

The engine has lots of power from a dead stop.  Much of the torque is focused at slower speeds.  With the cargo space full and 5 people that weight in at least 150lbs a piece, the torque comes in handy.  Uphill pulling power isn't the best without pushing the gas pedal to the ground.  Once in third gear, an uphill pull isn't so bad.  Once in second, an uphill pull with a full load is like a day in the park for this SUV.  During a snow covered mountain trip to an 8260 foot elevation, the low gear 4-wheel drive picked up a whole lot of traction.

On flat long drives the 4 Runner runs smooth.  The ride is quiet and peaceful feeling.  It seems like it doesn't mind having to travel 700 miles on a hot summer's day.

The only bad things about the 4 Runner is the lack of cup holders, unlike the Suburban which has almost two cup holders for every person in the vehicle.

Other than that, I would consider it more than reliable from the zero to 180,000 miles it has and many more to come.<br><br>
