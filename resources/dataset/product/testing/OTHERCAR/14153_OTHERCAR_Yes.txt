            We recently purchased an Olympus 460 Digital Camera, and within a week, the batteries were dead!!!  Dead I tell you, not even able to be revived...see related Epinion.

When we returned it to the retailer, we told them that we could not buy a camera where we would be saving money on film, and processing, and be paying much much more for batteries once a week, and expensive batteries at that.

So, after much ado, we zeroed in on the Fuji FInePix 1300.  It is a good camera, takes a variety of sizes of pictures, and the quality is far from excellent, but, it is good.  Serves the purpose of uploading to the web for family, friends, and auction sites.   I love how we can now take a shot and instantly send it across the wire to whomever we choose.

The camera itself is relatively easy to use, but then, I love gadgets of any kind.  So, in retrospect, it may be a little difficult to navigate the menu buttons for the novice, but, once you figure it out, it is pretty simple.  

I love the viewer, but, it does tend to get nose prints on it because of it's poor location, and there is no lense cover...yikes, lint lint lint!

Now, the software that came with it is pretty decent, and even a little bit of fun, for the addicted, however, I am having a heck of a time learning how to download the pics onto the computer...I have done it a few times, but it is not simple at all.  I consider myself pretty much computer literate, and man, it is making me crazy...so, if there are any advisors out there, please advise!!!

In any case, I am having fun, and isn't that what it is all about?
