            If this were a beauty contest, the Dodge Durango would be the hands-down winner. The week we spent behind the wheel of this beauty yielded more appreciative looks than any other SUV we tested. Its flared fenders give it a unique look, but the 4.7-liter V-8 engine is what provides the power. Our test vehicle, an SLT 4x4, came equipped with a hefty 235 horsepower 4.7-liter V-8 engine and automatic transmission. With the heavy-duty towing package, it became the heftiest of the bunch with a whopping 7600-pound towing capacity. Despite the fact that it was only a few inches longer than the Ford Explorer, the Durango had 18 cubic feet of additional cargo space, with all the rear seats folded-a real boon if you need to carry a lot of stuff. 

On the inside, it was easy to get comfortable in the Durango. The gray cloth interior seats offered plenty of room, although the optional third row seat is handy feature that is more appropriate for children than adults. Standard interior features include power steering, cruise control, dual airbags, power mirrors, doors and locks, remote keyless entry, AM/FM/cassette, rear anti-lock brakes and front air conditioning.
