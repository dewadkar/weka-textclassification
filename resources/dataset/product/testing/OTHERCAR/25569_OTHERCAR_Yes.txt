                <b>T</b>he world is full of small sports cars once again, the Miata, the Honda S2000, Honda Civic SI Etc. But with the Z3, BMW has one of the best, even with its downfalls in the performance category. It's compact, and a joy to handle. James Bond would have been happy with this one.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

 <b>T</b>here can not be a sports cars easier to drive than the BMW Z3, other than perhaps the Mazda Miata. The Z3 is  perfectly balanced and incredibly nimble. The steering is precise, with loads of feel. The Z3 is nearly fool-proof to drive. The 138 horsepower 1.9 DOHC unit has a huge surplus of power for everyday driving, however for extremely quick take-offs this car lacks what it takes to be a true roadster. 

<b>Acceleration</b> comes somewhat quick, however it also comes with a buzzy exhaust note that I found aggravating. BMW could have beefed up the sound effects here as Acura did with its Type R. <b>Handling</b> is excellent!  Even when traveling beyond 100 MPH, the Z3 feels rock steady and feels as solid as a BMW sedan on bumpy road surfaces. <b>Braking</b> is also good, the 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS provide assured stops at any time.

<b>About this little engine:</b> 

The 1.9 liter twin cam engine was BMW's largest four cylinder. It's a 16 valve unit with twin chain driven cams and hydraulic lifters. Its designed to maximize torque, thanks to its variable length intake manifold, which is effectively long at low RPM to improve torque. 133 lb-ft peak is reached at a relatively high RPM to help outright power. The engine is also designed to minimize friction. This helps the engine get better fuel economy, almost 36 MPG on the highway according to the EPA. This type of configuration will also help the Z3 remain reliable for many years to come.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> is very modern. The dashboard shares switches and gauges with its sedan car brothers. The interior is less exciting than the exterior, but its still 'ultra cool'. The seats are very supportive, and comfortable. Ergonomics are near perfect. As with all BMW's amenities are everywhere, power everything, CC, etc. <b>Cars.com</b> has a list of all the standard equipment, and a list of other reviews for this model year.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
    
  The <b>exterior</b> is the best looking (in my opinion) in its class. Noticed from miles away, this car has class, & style the Honda S2000, and Mazda Miata could only dream of. The Z3, thanks to its visual design, is a car that will undoubtedly not get lost in traffic.

<i>Price:</i>

    The <b>price</b> for these cars are going down pretty fast, but are still high, around $18,000 for a 97 model. Not bad for a small, fun car that carries the BMW nameplate

   <b>Reliability</b> has been good for the BMW Z3 since its introduction. Like the Mazda Miata, the Z3 enthusiast swears by these cars. For more info on reliability check out <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b>.
