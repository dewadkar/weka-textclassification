            The Lincoln Navigator drives as closely to a luxury sedan as possible without being one.  They are such great cars that we actually have two of them.  We have had them for about a year now, and we have had no trouble what so ever.  They are very durable cars.  You feel safe riding in it because of their large size and many safety features.  It has enough room in the car to fit seven people.  I have the captains chairs in the middle row.  If you chose the bench you would have even more room.

I would recommend this SUV to anyone who needs a larger car but doesn't want the mini van look.  It is a reliable car with a reasonable price.  They are great for vacationing, taking the kids to school, or just driving around. <br><br>
