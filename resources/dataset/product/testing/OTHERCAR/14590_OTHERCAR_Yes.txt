            Well, this car was passed down to me from my mother for my birthday. The car (her name is Betsey) is on mile number 155,000. I think one of the biggest appeals of old Hondas is that they do not LOOK that old. They are definitely more age-friendly than most other cars. Yeah, you can get a Volvo that is just as tough as a Honda, but the Honda looks so much cooler and sportier. 
There are a set of undesirable things that have come up in the years that we have owned this car, most of them have happened since I have owned the car, the past 6 months. 
The inside passenger door handle cracked in half down the middle, I've heard that this is pretty common in Hondas, but it can be easil fixed also. The door still functions normally it is just unsightly and one more thing to get fixed. The A/C knob falls off in a lot of the cars, also, another easy thing to have fixed. 
Also, I know it is extremely common in Hondas, especially older ones, that when they back out they tend to shake. Well, let me tell you, this girl shakes! I've noticed that it is worse in Hondas than in any other car, but with regular tire rotations it is significantly better. 
But, I think this car will go forever. There have not been many transmission problems (aside from a cracked radiator once 3 years ago) and Honda dealerships are usually really good about directing you towrards good service. 
This is an awesome car to buy for someone, especially a teenager because the car would last well into college even if it already has 100,000 miles on it. <br><br>
