            I bought this vehicle because it is a good value 4x4 sport utility. Looking at it, I was expecting a much more severe ride and everything that comes with it for it isn't a car and have been very pleased. Overall In almost 3 years I haven't had a single problem with it.
It performs quite well for a vehicle with such offroad capability, the on road handling is very predictable and has surprised me in it's ability to handle corners. The power is great, lots of low end torque, with the 5 Spd manual I even beat a V8 Durango once. The gas mileage is very reasonable considering the lack or aerodynamics combined with the gutsy engine, I see an average of around 19-20 mpg which is a mixture of about 60% highway and 40% city driving but Less around 15-18mpg when driving in 4x4.
I use the Jeep for hauling my stuff around when it won't fit inside the Honda where it's abundance of torque is very beneficial.
As far as who shouldn't buy this vehicle and who should ?? Well, it's a Jeep so don't expect it to ride like an Oldsmobile, but for a Truck it does ride rather smoothly and quietly. I think that the busy ride that alot of people describe can be attributed to the short wheelbase and the Wrangler RT tires that come with it. I put on a set of Michelin LTX-ATs and it smoothed out the ride considerably.
My parents purchased a 97 Cherokee after moving to New Mexico and love their Cherokee as well. They haven't had any problems with their's and love the commanding view of the road. They had an episode where the vehicle (due to the road conditions) was sliding off of the road sideways . A quick shift into 4x4 quickly remedied the situation and prevented a potentially disastrous situation. My parents now thank God for on the fly 4 wheel drive !!!

I looked at other sport utes such as the Toyota 4 Runner, Nissan Pathfinder Isuzu Rodeo and I couldn't justify the $$$30K price for a 4x4 Truck. I liked the Toyota but found the seats to be very small and thin for a 30K vehicle. The Nissan was ok but had a chintzy feel to it. The Isuzu felt flimsy in comparison to the Jeep. 
 I own another vehicle ( Honda) that I use for day to day commuting and wanted something more reasonably priced as a second vehicle. So all in all this affordable , practical and reliable vehicle allows me to own 2 vehicles for the cost of another more expensive one !
I love my Jeep Cherokee and plan to keep for years to come !<br><br>
