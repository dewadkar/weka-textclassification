            For the last 9 years I was driving Plymouth Acclaim and I must admit it was a good choice except for the fact that the speed sensor had to be changed every few months  and my driveway is soiled with numerous oil leaks.When my Chrysler finally gave up, I started looking at Japanese cars for the first time. After comparing Corolla and Mazda Protege I chose the latter and I am so glad I did. Driving is becoming a pleasure again! Now I know that you can make a car that:
1. Drives almost like it is on rails
2. Uses little gas but has quite an acceleration and passing power
3. Is compact but has lots of inside space ( I am a 6 foot plus guy) and a decent trunk
4. Has a terrific sound system 
5. Has comfortable seats and nice finish
6. Has a great warranty and a 3 year free road assistance program

What else do you need? Get a Protege! <br><br>
