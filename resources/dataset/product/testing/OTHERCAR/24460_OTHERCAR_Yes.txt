            To me, a complete novice in the digital camera word, the Sony Cyber-shot is the best thing, in the camera world, since sliced bread.

My husband actually bought it for me for my brothers wedding in England.  I was originally quite wary of it thinking that &quot;the first time I touch this thing its going to break&quot; or &quot;I'll never learn to use this thing&quot;, but to my surprise it was not only easy to use but it also felt sturdy and comfortable to use.

I loved the fact that I could go back through the pictures that I had taken and delete the ones that I didn't want.  Also the special effects built into the camera were a bonus and nice to try out.  The video PAL/NTSC was a nice option for me and my family in the UK.

By the time I got home I had snapped the equivalent of 4 1/2 rolls of film, and I didn't have to wait on anyone to get them developed and I only had the ones I wanted.  I took all the pictures at the highest resolution and once they are printed out they look just like they would coming out of any one hour photo place.

I would recommend this to both novice and professional alike.<br><br>
