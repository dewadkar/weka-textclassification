            Actually, I first reviewed this as rlwpaw5707 but that account has been deactivated. But I've now owned this car for almost three years.  Purchased 12/14/99 when it had 17K miles.  Now has 53K.  

Regularly serviced and it has been reliable.  Handles quite well.  Got rid of the miserable Goodyear tires and replaced with Yokohamas and the annoying pulling to the right is now gone.  The dash has been a problem but was covered under extended warranty.  Bottom of steering column trim rattles and one of these days I will have to fix that.  I'm 6'6" and 260 pounds but can get fairly comfortable although not a terrific car for long drives although not that bad.  I could use a little larger car but my wife loves it.  Probably will hang on to it until it has about 100K as the resale is probably not that great.  However, that indicates the used car buyer could get a terrific deal.  

I have recently driven a '99 Camry with 94K.  It is a little larger but the suspension is much softer.  I much prefer the Mystique handling.  However, I have also driven a new 2002 Camry and let me tell you that is one fine automobile.  It would be much more comfortable than the Mystique but I am not yet ready to part with the money for a new one.  For the use we have for a car it doesn't really pay to buy new.  We do a lot of running around locally and it is just fine.  The so-called "premium" radio cd player is marginal at best, while the CD is fine, the AM reception is very poor and staticky.  My '96 Ranger radio is much better in this regard.  One thing that annoys me is that when you unlock the driver's door to get in that all the doors do not unlock.  A niggling point but I like this feature.  

The trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down.  There isn't a whole lot of room in the back but not unacceptable.  Recently tried to get in the back of a 2001 Mazda Millenia and it was even worse.  That ruled out that car even though the dealer would have given it away to get it out of his inventory.  

Brakes still work well, no problems.  The transmission seemed to be a little iffy about 10,000 miles ago but a change of fluid took care of the problem.  Not sure what to make of that.  My '94 Crown Vic had the same problem and a Ford dealer told me the overdrive was going out but again the fluid change resolved the problem and I drove it another 35,000 miles before trading in.  

The engine has plenty of power, A/C is very good, visibility is fine.  Recently had it detailed and looked like a new car.  No evidence of corrosion anywhere.  I change my own oil and filter and everything looks good underneath. I did have a heater/A-C switch resister go bad but $10 and my labor fixed that problem and it was a relatively simple job.  The grill has a tendency to flake off the chrome so don't lean on the high pressure hose at the car wash.  That is a $161 part.  I just live with it. 

All-in-all, if you can get a good deal on one I would say go for it.  It is a better handling car than the Taurus and more comfortable from what I have read. If you are interested, check ebay for some deals.  I recently saw a low mileage one that went for about $6000.  That seems to be a good value in my view.
