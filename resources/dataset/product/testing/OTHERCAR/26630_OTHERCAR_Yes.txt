            This cloudy afternoon saw the Joester making a pilgrimage down to one of the local BMW dealerships to take an extended spin in the Z3 Roadster 3.0i. After two hours putting this little sex machine through its paces, I wanted to take it home with me. I even promised to make it breakfast the next morning. 

Over a two hour period I guided the little minx through ever type of driving experience I could think of. With the top down, I flew down tiny inner city lanes, out on to the wide freeways of Brisbane, and down some winding coastal roads. I wanted to catch the Z3 out in some way. I didn�t. I was quite thrilled to be disappointed! 

I�ll break this review into categories, to try and capture all the details as well as my joyous experience. 

<b>Engine</b> 

BMW have produced the Z3 Roadster in two engine sizes: the 2.5 litre and the 3 litre version that I enjoyed scooting around in for the afternoon. 

Being a man, and relating engine size to one of my own personal attributes, I chose to test drive the 3.0i. For the whole trip I couldn�t get over what the boys in Bavaria were able to put in the front end of this little hottie of a car. I found myself continually dropping back in speed so that I could get a buzz out of its acceleration. I also have to admit to chirping it excessively taking off from the lights. The smooth delivery of power is something I doubt I�d ever tire of. The bloke at the dealership tells me that despite the Z3�s power it�s actually one of the most environmentally friendly petrol engines on the market. It�s been certified as a genuine ULEV (Ultra-low emissions vehicle). That could be my excuse for owning one of these gorgeous machines! It�s the environmentalist in me! 

For the technical boffins out there, the engine is an inline 6 cylinder number that generates 225 horsepower which is delivered by BMW�s famous Double VANOS (their variable valve timing system). Even though this slinky little car is delivering a considerable amount of power, it feels like a lot more. Being low to the ground you get that delightful sensation of speed similar to the one you get in a go-cart. Your backside feels like it�s about 3 inches off the road! 

<b>Transmission</b> 

All Z3s come with a standard 5-speed manual transmission. With it�s �M� shaped configuration I felt like I was a racing car driver every time I shifted up or down. I found myself looking forward to corners so I could pull off a tricky downshift like they taught me once at defensive driving course. Excellent fun! 

I�m told that BMW can provide a space-age 5-speed �Steptronic� auto-manual transmission. I imagine there�s a little bit of a price tag on that little bit of technology though. The dealership I visited didn�t have one in stock, so I can�t tell you what it looks like or performs like. Paddles next to the wheel? I�m not sure. However, I was more than happy shifting up and down on the standard transmission like Speed Racer. 

Motoring around in the city streets, I got the impression that the Z3 may have needed a sixth gear for the highways. It wasn�t to be. My shiny little friend was as much at home on the open freeway as it was down in the city�s traffic. 

<b>Road Feel</b> 

The Z3 is well and truly in touch with the road. It�s not a SUV after all. With a short wheelbase, sporty suspension and performance tyres, you feel every dip and bump in the road. But you�re loving it! It�s what little sports cars are all about. Anyone who�s ever owned an old MG will know exactly what I�m talking about. 

In kind repayment for telling you exactly where the road is, the Z3 hugs it like you�re on a rail line. I found my mind reverting to the slot car tracks that I had as a kid. With this kind of control, there�s a safety payout. You�re less likely to lose control or even flip this little beauty. 

<b>Steering</b> 

What can I say? The first phrase that popped into my head when I was thinking about what the steering was doing for me was, �German engineering brilliance�. Control and responsiveness was all the go as I took the car in and out of traffic and around the tight turns of the coastal roads later in the afternoon. I even found myself giving it a good ol� wiggle along the straights from time to time, just for the thrill of it. The steering is stock standard rack and pinion stuff, but it�s extremely well put together. 

<b>Design Layout</b> 

It�s not quite like getting into the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard, but there is a little effort involved in entering and extricating yourself from the Z3 Roadster. The low seating with a contradicting high doorsill requires some twisting and turning. You don�t care though. You�ll be far too excited about turning the engine over. 

Once you�re in the comfy bucket seat, you�ll be quite surprised at how roomy it is. I�m 5�8� and found that I had to bring the seat forward a fair bit to get at the pedals. Therefore I doubt that my taller friends (damn you for being tall!) will have much in the way of dramas with the cockpit size of the Z3. 

Back to the �comfy bucket seat�, I�ve got to say that it was the most delightful car seat that I�ve ever sat in. It actually hugs you. When whizzing around corners, you stay nicely with the car. I can also imagine that these seats would be a joy over a long journey. No driver�s bum with these little babies! 

Still on the seats, I have to mention the seat heaters. It was a humid 33 degrees celcius here in Brisbane today, but I turned them on all the same. Within about 30 seconds you can feel the warmth soak into your back through the seat. Even in the heat, it was a delightful experience. Somehow soothing. For those poor souls living in cold climates, this little feature would grant you the joys of convertible motoring without hypothermia. 

Oh, I shouldn�t forget to mention that this is strictly a two-seater. There are no back seats. That�s fine, as far as I�m concerned. It�ll be just you and that slinky someone. No more car pooling! 

<b>Standard Features</b> 

Just about everything you could want is included with the Z3. You�re not going to be ruthlessly upsold on options by a cunning salesperson. 

Here�s a small list of this little sexpot�s standard features: 

Air Conditioning, Driver Air Bag, Passenger Air Bag, Alloy Wheels, Anti-Lock Brakes, Alarm, Cruise Control, Fog Lamps, Power Locks, Power Mirrors, Power Steering, Power Windows, Anti-Theft Radio, Power Driver Seat, Power Passenger Seat, Leather Seats, Tachometer, Traction Control. 

What more could you want, hey? 

<b>Colours (or Colors for my North American friends)</b> 

I know that to a lot of blokes, the colour is very secondary in a motorvehicle buying decision. Not so for me! Oh no! I�m not getting about in a car that�s baby poo brown. No siree! 

The Z3 I drove this afternoon was a very nice colour called �Titanium Silver�. It�d probably be the colour I would choose for a purchase. The other colours include: 

Alpine White 
Dakar Yellow (the Z3 really isn�t a �yellow� kind of car) 
Bright Red 
Jet Black (for the Goth drivers out there) 
Atlanta Blue Metallic (like the Z3 that appears in the James Bond film, Golden Eye) 
Sienna Red (looks like a maroon) 
Steel Grey 
Impala Brown (too pooey for my liking) 
Oxford Green (a mid to dark green that looks very distinguished) 

<b>Pricing & The Competition</b> 

I�ll give the US prices for this review. However, I will say that the Z3 is considerably more expensive here in Australia. 

For the 3 litre Z3 you�ll be looking at about $37,900. Haggle away because I�ve read that the factory invoice price is $34,270. 

Looking at the little brother, the 2.5i, you�ll be looking at $31,300 (factory invoice - $28,330) 

BMW�s Z3 is stack up against such competitors as the Mercedes Kompressor, the Toyota MR2, the Miata, and the new Lexus SC430. For my mind, all of these are desperate attempts to compete in the market which the Z3 dominates. 

<b>Summing It Up</b> 

I leapt into the Z3 roadster as the cynical Epinionator that I am, and climbed out a couple of hours later in love! It�s one amazing machine. Sex and violence all wrapped up in one, and the best sports car you�re likely to find under US$50,000. It�ll give you all of the performance you need, and comes with just about every option standard. The only thing I felt I was missing was a stunning blonde in the passenger seat. Although that could be fixed with this car. I caught exactly 257 admiring glances from women driving around in the �my� Z3 this afternoon. Yes, it�s chick magnet. 

Go test drive one today. You�ll love it!
