            I for one believe that the '91-'98 model S-class cars from Mercedes-Benz were arguably the best luxury cars in the world. 

Did you know that the S500 (the middle guy, we have the six cylinder S320, then the S420 (in some markets) and the S500 being the V8s, and then the V-12 powered S600) is the best-selling luxury car ever?  Yes!  A $100,000 car earns that honor!  Why?  Because it is fantastic, and in all corners of the Earth civlians, politicians, and others (ahem) have realized this car's attributes.

There are many people who say the car looks oversized, like a dinosaur, from the outside.  Well, yes, it's a big car, but in my opinion it's got the classiest presence on the road.  Don't tell me Bentley, BMW, or Caddy, *THIS* is class.  And it's so intimidating, as a luxury car should be, kind of, if you know what I mean.  This is surely one big reason the car has been wildly-popular amongst certain &quot;organizations&quot; and politicians who fear for their lives a bit too much.  ;-)

Step inside, and you actually are stepping UP into the seat!  Seriously, the car is high off the ground like that.  Once inside, on those splendid teutonic seats, you are in perhaps the most spacious interior offered.  Not only does the rear legroom almost equal that of the almighty 7-series, (in the LWB editions, the S320 actually if offered as a Short WheelBase if you want, for like $3000 less), it beats that BMW in terms of shoulder and hip room.  There is something about Mercedes cars, when you sit there in the driver's seat, look at the dash/console, you feel something very special, even if it's not that attractive and colorful.  You feel like Superman somehow.  Invisible on the road.  And when the car starts moving it only reinforces that.

In '96 they introduced the 5-spd auto, and am I glad to report it's the best automatic made by anyone, period.  Perfect.  And to think, it is lighter than the 4-spd it succeeds, and is built from less parts too.  Bravo.  The engines:  Oh boy, well, the S320 has an in-line six developing 230HP and it enough to motivate the car with authority.  The S500 (btw Merecedes designates its car names according to engine displacement) offers a 5.0L V8 pushing out 320HP (or 315HP in the US market).  This is a monster of an engine.  Easily the best and most successful Mercedes has ever made.  The S500 is loaded with gizmos and weighs 2 tons, but this engine is powerful enough to hussle it w/o any hint of hesitation, at any speed.  Then you have the S600's 6L V-12.  394HP.  421 lb-ft of torque.  Smoother than an electric engine.  I drove an S-class coupe with this engine (SC600).  Oh my goodness, what a pull this engine has.  V-12s are usually given the 2-valve-per-cylinder treatment (sans Ferrari) due to the desired charectaristics of V12s: No, not top-end power, but torque, smooth torque all over the place.  Not so with Benz.  They still chose the expensive route of 4-valving the 6L V-12 (I think each engine is hand-made, to a certain extent?)  Even with a 2.5 ton curb weight (has even more gadgets, this 600), the car can hit 60mph from a standstill in a flat 6 seconds, even faster times were quoted!  

All these cars handle corners in a way that belies their weight.  Like weightlifting champions performing perfect ballet.  And on mud&amp;snow tires nonetheless!  Very very impressive, but hey, these cars command A LOT of money, so we consumers should demand A LOT in return.  With that said, nobody knows how to combine luxury with sporty driving like the Germans, that is a fact.  And the S-class is better than world-class.  

Rediculously quiet even at triple digit speeds, the S-class is equipped with dual-pane glass (3mm of glass on both ends with a 3mm pocket of air in between, giving an overall 9mm thickness).  By the way did you know that's the basic design of bullet-proofing?  heheh, no, they are not bullet-proof, you need a little more material to implement than that, but their benefits are:  Better sound/temperature insulation, and virtually immune to fogging up.  Now several competitors offer these, but as far back as the early 90s the S-class offered these.  Nevermind the air suspension, and many other innovations (did you know M-B invented the crumple zone?  The airbag?  ABS? Yup, yup, yup).

Safety?  The best.  Easily.  Don't believe the US-born bias towards Volvos being the safest cars on the road.  The Mercedes S-class is the safest car, be sure of that.  Nevermind the sheer size and heft, it is undoubtedly better-designed for a crash.  For example, Merecedes is the ONLY manufacturer out there that has 2 firewalls between the engine and passenger compartments, with all the electric wiring between them (usually other just have 1 firewall, something necessary to isolate you from noise, heat, etc.).  Not only that, they gold-plate the wire connectors in their cars!  The only place this is done besides in Mercedes factories is at Boeing and Airbus for their freakin' jumbo jets!  Ok?  Get the drift?  You pay the premium, but they sure as hell deliver.

I remember being a passenger in an S600 on the highway once, when the driver did a full-throttle kickdown at about 60mph.  The car accelerated with such authority and smoothness up until 155mph (electronic limit) it was scary.  It was pushing you into the seat the whole way like it would from a standstill acceleration run.  We're talking torque delivery that is so consistent it makes even the most unenthusiastic person (about cars) wonder about all the engineering that went into this machine.  The car was completely, I mean COMPLETELY, quiet and stable at that speed too.  Again, the car costs close to $150k, but let me say, you get what you pay for, and more importantly, there is no competition.

No, there really isn't.  The V-12 powered 750iL from BMW is really to be compared to the S500, there is nothing that touches that hand-made, V-12 equipped beast called S600.  But yes, it is as expensive as a some Ferraris.  However, it should be noted that the S500 has been the best-selling luxury car because many have deemed the extra cost and power of the S600 unneccessary (plus it isn't as durable cuz of the extra electronic sophistication).  This is how powerful and capable the S500 is.  Fabulous, and unless you like the more youthful presence of the excellent 7-series and Audi A8, there really is no comparison otherwise.  Geez, you even have suede headliners in the S-class!  

It's hard to explain, you just need to spend maybe a week in one.  You can drive these behomoths like a sports car and they will say &quot;OK, let's do it baby&quot;.  They cocoon you from the outside world in better ways than you can imagine from a passenger car.  The ultimate in highway cruising and safety.  Oh yeah, there's something about Mercedes cars on the highway.  They just FLY!!!  It's strange, maybe they put things in their cars they don't tell the public about.  Yes they pretty much all require a split second to start moving once you floor it, but oh boy when the steam starts venting, it picks up that speed real fast!  Hey, autobahn-bred cars, what else can you say.

And speaking of the new S-class, in my opinion, they won't be HALF as successful.  Yes they are better cars dynamically, and more efficient in many ways, but first of all, I hate the rear-end view (looks like a Mazda or something) and while the headlights are sexy as hell, they are uhm, strange.  And the interior, while quite beautiful, with the slopy curves and all, is DEFINITELY using cheaper parts (This is called re-management, hey!  Let's reduce the asking price of the car, but make it cheaper to build, so net profit is up anyhow!  People won't know!).  Err, no.  You ain't fooling too many people there, DaimlerChrysler.  I hope those of you who bought these cars realized this and don't really mind (ok, you're not buying a CHEAP car, just expect obvious compromises over the previous generation).  That's too bad, it seems Merecedes-Benz is spiraling downwards. The new M-class SUV?  Quality ain't the usual MB stuff.  I hope the new C and E class don't follow suit, it's a shame, although this will give BMW and Audi the opportunity perhaps, and rightfully so.  May the fittest only survive, indeed.
