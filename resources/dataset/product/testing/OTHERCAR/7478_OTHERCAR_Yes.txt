            2000 Grand Am continues to follow in the Pontiac tradition of allowing people to purchase and drive in sensible, yet sporty automobiles.  Since it's 1999 overhaul, Grand Am has distinguished itself as one of the most beautiful cars on the market.  

It's large ridged body moldings truly finish of the sporty look given initially by the top and midsections of the body.  The interior leaves nothing to be desired either.  The speedometer and odometer cluster really just scream the word &quot;PONTIAC!&quot;.  It's many curves can easily remind one of a instrumentation used on many race cars or the instrumentation of cars of our parents' times.  The power offered by the Grand Am is impressive, but if you need that extra &quot;kick&quot;, be sure to get a V6 engine.   Happy Driving!<br><br>
