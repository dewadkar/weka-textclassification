            I have never written a review before, in my life. Most of these reviews here are so obviously written by employees or rival companies, depending on their slant.<p>

Anyway, short and to the point. As far as Minivans go this is one of the better ones. The Chryslers and Fords/Mazdas have quality and resale value issues, the Honda Odyssey is starting to show its age, and the new Nissan Quest is just to weird with the middle cluster, styling and interior room.<p>

Have only had it a while now and some of the nice features 
are the interior layout, ride, quiet, very roomy, the windows on the slinging doors actually go down (something the Odyssey lacks, wide drivers and passenger seats, power sliding doors, fold down 3rd row seats, entertainment system.
<p>
Some of the bad stuff, underpowered, homelink option was defective, had to get cloth trim and then have dealer install the leather
to get the right combination of packages we wanted, poor exterior color choices, black shiny plastic trim (almost like black lacquer) on the dash and used for the door pulls
that are starting to show scratches easily. Dealer inflating prices and creating availability problems. Going to Toyota Dealer to buy is bad experience, service ok. Watch out for the paint quality which can vary widely.

**RECALL NOTICE**
Check out August 23 Edition of Automotive News for details
concerning the recall notice. Basically, the are not dangerous, but in 1 accident the gas tank leak on impact so they are redesigning the fuel tank.
