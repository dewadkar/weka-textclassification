            I bought this as my first and absolutely love it.  It is a big car i must admit it has a lot of back seat foot room, huge trunk and is very comfortable.  I have worked with cars many years from working in retail after-market parts and at dealerships.  The Concorde drives smooth and gets great gas mileage still!!  One con i must admit that it does have which decreases overtime is the dash and hood are huge but judgement comes with time.  I feel very safe driving it, it is a very solid car.  I recommend this to everyone, big cars are great for their safety for beginners and it is also great for a family car.<br><br>
