            The Ferrari Modena was born to be a racer.  From its rigid lightweight aluminum chassis and body, its aerodynamic shape, to its powerful 395-bhp V-8 engine, there's only one purpose: to be one of the world's best high performance sports car.  Driving this famous car is not just about the ultimate performance, it is also about experiencing the Ferrari mystique  that makes any car enthusiast's heart beat quicker.

I open the door to the Modena.  Slide into the highly bolstered driver's seat.  Insert and turn the ignition key.  The mid-mounted 3.6-liter powerplant immediately comes to a modest roar.  Wrap my fingers around the thick steering wheel, slip the cool round aluminum shift knob foward and listen to it click into gear.  Clutch out and easy on the throttle.  I feel as though I can sense the entire lustrous history of the exotic Italian carmaker through my fingertips.

On the road, the Modena is very comfortable and seems glued to the asphalt and is undisturbed by any winds.  On the race track, the Modena can make a racer wanna-be look like a professional.  The Modena turns instantly.  The smoothness with which the V-8 delivers maximum torque to the rear never breaks the tires loose or upsets car's balance.  Through the corners, the Modena shows a slight hint of understeer and almost undecetable body roll.

For a car lover who is a little &quot;racy&quot;, then this is the perfect match!<br><br>
