                 I just got a base model 1500 regular cab silverado (automatic) about a month ago and it's still impressing me so far.  The large gas tank is great since the nearest Wal-Mart to me is an hour drive and I offer home health to remote areas.  The interior room and seats are huge which is also wonderful.  The drive almost rivals that of a car since I just have a V6 engine and standard suspension.  The 4x4's and heavy duty packages that I test drove were too bumpy for me, but this one I chose doesn't make me miss my car at all.  I just got my first oil change so I can't tell you what you really need to know -- how is this vehicle going to hold up in the long run?  are there going to be lots of major repairs?  

     Well I'm keeping my fingers crossed along with you and will keep you updated.  For now though this truck is serving me well--I just took it too Big Bend Nat'l Park and the lower gears did great on the mountain roads, but didn't quite cut it when it came to the unpaved mountain roads, the four wheel drive was necessary.  Just examine what your needs are in a truck and if they are similar to mine I think you will be pleased with the silverado.<br><br>
