                The Mercury Sable that only looks slightly different than its twin Ford Taurus ( though I like Sable's look better) is much less popular than Taurus, After my first test drive I began wondering &quot;why would anyone get a plum when they can get strawberry for LESS price&quot; 
    I just had to purchase this car after test driving Mazda 626(1996), Toyota Camry(1998), Nissan Maxima (1994&amp;1998) and Honda Accord (1997)...Though the Sable was the least expensive of all the tested cars, it felt the most expensive of all of them. 
     
    Ergonomic: very stylishly done, the buttons are big and it is very easy to operate. not only that, the sound system was near premium quality, I actually thought it was better than the bose system from Maxima which had very small buttons and didn't sound as good. the cup holders were my favorite because it had 3 different sized cup holders and DID NOT block my stereo system which most cars do, I use the stereo system a lot and when those cups block it, it gets very annoying.

    ride quality: Smoothest of all cars I tested, Gave very quite ride, I felt like I was in an Acura.
 
    Style: Though many people dislikes Sable's exterior design, I actually think it is a sleek looking car, especially its rear long lengthed lights looked very sleek.

    Overally, this car would be perfect car for a business man or family car since it recieved 5 stars on crashing tests with a lot of rooms...And if you are one of the people who only go for what other people go for, (camry-only...accord-only) I want to make a suggestion that Mercury Sable told my heart over Camry and Accord<br><br>
