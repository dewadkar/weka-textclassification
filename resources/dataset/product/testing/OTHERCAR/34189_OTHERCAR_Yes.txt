            I chose this Passat because I was originally interested in the Audi A4 and A6.  I have never owned a &quot;luxury&quot; car and was toying with the Audi.  As I studied the price structure and finally took the test drive, I was exceedingly pleased with feeling of power and the balance of the drive.  Anyway, someone mentioned that the Passat was practically the same car as the A4 A6 except for a few superficial &quot;luxury&quot; features.  After driving the Passat V6 2.8 Liter engine model, luxury package, I was amazed by the German Car Feel.  This was indeed a luxury car in the guise of a general market vehicle.  The car felt tight and the vehicle was stable and strong.  It has terrific power with a 195 HP V6 version and the Tiptronic gear option from Porsche gives you the feel and control of a manual sport gear shift without the extra pedal - all controlled electronically.  The car was a little pricier than the competing Accords and Camry - but man it's 50% more car.  4 people can travel in it comfortably, the seats are firm but require manual adjustments.  But where the car counts, in the control and power of the driving, it is a miracle.  I love it.  It's the best car I've owned thus far.  About 1 month after I bought it, the Passat was listed as the 1999 &quot;Best Buy&quot; by Consumer Reports.  My judgement was validated by this popular consumer magazine.  The only problems I've had over the last year has been with a bad molding strip which was replaced without cost.  The interior instruments lights are a cool neon blue and red.  Very sporty.<br><br>
