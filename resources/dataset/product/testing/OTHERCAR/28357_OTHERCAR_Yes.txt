            I have a 2001 LS, now 13 months old, 23,000 miles.  I thought everyone might like to hear from someone who's actually been driving one for a year, rather than people who simply test-drove it or reviewed it 2 weeks after buying it...

It's been a good car overall so far.

It's been reliable - it hasn't left me on the side of the road yet.

I like the styling very much; it rides much nicer than a sports car (my last car was a Nissan 300ZX, which has a hard ride by comparison), but the LS doesn't handle as well, which is to be expected.  It handles well, though.

The two problems I have with this car are:

   1. It's a V6, and the transmission was obviously intended to be mated with a V8.  Not enough power in the V6 to make it downshift when appropriate.  The V8 my friend has acts much better.
   2. The dealer servicing was a so-so experience. (but this is probably just my dealer... could happen with any car)

Oh, it did get recalled.  Another minus.

It also has those annoying door locks that lock when you put it in drive.  As a plus, however, it can be turned off - either by the in-dash computer, if you paid extra to get one, or by the dealer.
