            The Casio QV 700, generally is an easy camera for the novice to use.
Self focusing lens, clear concise LCD Display gives an accurate image of what is to be captured on your memory chip.
Memory is easily filled up, and deletion of a singular picture does not ensure enough room for another to replace.
The downloading process is somewhat tedious, with an occasional communication problem noted. Be prepared to start over if your system has halted. Downloading errors are more noticed with &quot;older&quot; pictures but a simple conversion form fine to economy has helped retrieve the photos which will not process.
Battery life is a problem and this author was only capable of purchasing an adapter from a specialty shop.
Maneuverable lens makes taking pictures more convenient at different levels
A photo enhancement program is recommended since the pictures develop somewhat dark.
Very easy to use. Results acceptable convienent for families, friends graduation or even the corperate user.<br><br>
