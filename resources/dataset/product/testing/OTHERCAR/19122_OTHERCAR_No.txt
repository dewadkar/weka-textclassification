I purchased my 1999 vehicle new in July of 1998.  I bought the V6 GLS with a package that included alloy wheels, moonroof, an integrated rear window sunshade, heated side mirrors and upgraded stereo.  Pre-wiring for the CD changer is standard so I purchased the changer and installed it myself to save a few bucks.

I was wowed by the looks of the car (distinctive styling), the German engineering and the many features available. In the now 4 years that I have owned the vehicle I have not been disappointed by the looks and the way it drives. Additionally, I have had many opportunities to haul around luggage for 4 adults, lawn equipment, and numerous household items.  The roominess of the trunk and the cargo area with the fold down seats has been quite impressive and has become one of my favorite features!

Those are all of the things I love about the car - but unfortunately I have encountered numerous mechanical problems.  During the warranty period (at that time 2 yrs, 24,000 miles) I experienced a few minor problems with the check engine light coming on as the result of the throttle sticking. At the 3 year mark (with approximately 35,000 miles) I experienced major engine trouble which required the engine to be replaced.

Fortunately, the engine replacement was covered by the powertrain warranty (10 years, 100,000 miles)but Volkswagen and/or the dealership where the work occurred would not provide a loaner vehicle or pay for a rental car while this repair work was occurring.  This resulted in me shelling out several hundred dollars for a rental car while the engine was delivered from Canada and installed. 

Since the replacement the engine has consistently leaked oil and at one point stopped running while I was driving the vehicle.  The leaking oil problem still has not been resolved despite numerous trips to the dealership and numerous calls to Volkswagen customer service.

I have been severely disappointed (to put it mildly) with the terrible service I have received both at the dealership and from Volkswagen customer service.  They simply seem to not care about the quality of the service they provide and as a result I look forward to not being a Volkswagen owner for much longer.

June 2002 Update - 
As mentioned previously the replacement engine leaked oil for several weeks.  I took the vehicle in for an oil change and asked that the engine leak be addressed.  After leaving my car at the dealership for an entire day I received a call stating that they were unable to change the oil until they determined the reason for the oil leak.  The service agent also stated he was waiting to hear from a field representative before they could move forward.  I was given the option to leave my car with the dealership but based on their track record I knew better than that.  I picked up my car with the promise that they would contact me as soon as the field representative had given his insight into the leaking oil problem.

After not hearing from the dealership for over a week I called back and was told they were still waiting to hear from the field rep.  Another week went by and then another and then another.  As each week went by I would call VW national customer care, the agent answering the phone would be appropriately appalled that I had not received a response, the agent would call the dealership while I was on hold for several minutes (15 - 20 on average) and then the service agent would come on the line and apologize but tell me that there was nothing that could be done until the mysterious field rep called in.  This occurred for 6 weeks!! Read that last sentence again - I assure you it is not an exaggeration.

Finally, after 6 weeks, I received a call indicating that I could bring my vehicle in to be serviced.  I made an appointment at which time I clearly explained that the car would be left with them for a day, but would need to be ready by 4 pm.  I am sure you can already guess this next event - but when I called at 3:30 I was told the car was not ready and I would have to leave it with them for another day.  I sarcastically responded that would work for me as long as they were providing me with a car to drive.  I got the same song and dance about how they don't provide loaners.  To make a long story short I picked up my car that afternoon - the oil had been changed but it still leaked oil.

I had to schedule yet another appointment after I made arrangements to use a friend's vehicle. My appointment was for a Thursday and I was told by the dealership that I would have my car back no later than Monday of the following week.  When did I receive my car you ask?  On a Thursday exactly 5 business days later.  The problem apparently was a cracked valley cover that was replaced.

The problems with this car and the ridiculously poor service has soured me on Volkswagen forever.
