            I decided last year to jump into the mainstream and get myself a digital camera.  I have a few friends that have them already and I wanted to make sure I was going to get a camera that would be what I needed/wanted.  I didn't want to get something that had extra things on it that I wouldn't use.

I went to the library and got the Consumers Reports magazine and started reading.  What kind did I want?  Would it be 1.3 mega pixels 2??  3??  I looked at some of the various models in stores too for size.  Some like Canon were just too small.  Others like Sony's Maverick were too big.

I thought to myself, well I like using Kodak paper for my film lets see what Kodak has to offer. The first thing I noticed about the DX3900 was the digital zoom, 2x optical and 3x digital zoom.  I wanted to be able to take really close closeups and the DX3900 had the highest.  I wanted to find a camera that didn't have too many buttons to learn.  I don't know about you but the more buttons are on a gadget the more panic I feel about using it.  I want something thats easy to use, where I can just grab it and use it.  This camera only has 3. A menu button, a select button and then the mode dial (capture - take pictures, review - display pictures on the LCD screen, setup - customize settings). The Kodak online store has a virtual area where you can see what all the functions are on the camera and what they do, I guess that sold me as to how easy this was going to be.  So I took the plunge.  I wasn't disappointed.

The camera came with an 8meg compactflash card which even on the lowest setting will only take 23 pictures.  Unlike the other DX models this one doesn't have built in memory.  So you'll probably want to purchase a larger card.  I also purchased the docking station.  This acts not only a mode to transfer pictures to your computer with just the press of one button but also as a battery recharger as well.  I just leave my camera on that when I'm not using it.  The instruction book that comes with the camera was very "to the point", wasn't hard to follow unlike some VCR instructions!  =)

Some of the things I like about this camera is I can choose to turn off the flash when I'm indoors.  There's a self timer so that I can be in the pictures too. On the bottom of the camera it has a tripod mount so I can still use my tripod from my manual camera. It also has a built-in lens cover.  The quality of the pictures is great, very sharp images even on the lowest quality setting. It also tells you when the battery is getting low. I havn't tested the battery power to see how long it will last but I do know that prolonged use of the LCD screen for picture taking will drain it faster. It takes 2 AA batteries. In the manual it suggests lithium or you can get the Ni-MH rechargeable battery pack, which is what I have.

The software that you get I really like and its easy to install.  Under modify you can trim, enhance, clear red eye, adjust the brightness/contrast, adjust the color and darken/lighten your subject.  They have some fun effects too.  You can turn your picture into a black and white photo, turn your picture into a coloring book, mosaic effect and sepia which means make it look like an old western picture.  Using their software I can email pictures to people without having to open up my yahoo account and attach the file.  I can put a message in the email and choose the size of picture I want to send my friends (small, medium, large).  It even saves those addresses for the next time I want to send emails.  Other features are slideshow, print, and album pages.  I havn't used the album feature yet.

There are only two things I don't like and they are minor when you compare it overall.  First the camera does seem rather small.  Its fine for me but my Husband has large hands and its almost too small for him.  The LCD screen on the back is small also.  They really could have made the camera at least 2"higher and wider and it still would be an awsome camera.

Will it work with your computer?  When I first got it I was running 2 systems, WIN2000 and ME.  now I have a new computer that has WIN XP and no problems installing and/or using the software there.
