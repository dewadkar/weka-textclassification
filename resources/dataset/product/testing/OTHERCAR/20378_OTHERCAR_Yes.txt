            My husband and I (with our chocolate lab) love our 2001 Mazda Tribute. It is a 4WD SUV that
drives more like a car. It is not built on a truck frame, but rather a frame designed for this SUV (meaning
it is safer.) The Tribute is a V6, making it powerful. Our gas mileage is 20 on the highway,
and 16 around town. We ski, so we take it to the mountain frequently. It handles very well in
4WD. The car is primary front wheel drive, but it has a sensing mechanism that transfers power to
wheels that need it. It also has a button on the dash which can be pressed to permanently place it
in 4WD. (This is very handy driving up Mt. Hood in snowy and icy conditions in OR). The Tribute has
a very roomy interior. The back seats fold down to increase cargo room. (They also recline if you need
a nap in the backseat.) We purchased the middle model with a towing package and have everything
we would need. It has a 5 disc CD changer and a moon roof. One of the best things is that it is not
too big. It is very easy to drive with a smooth ride. I am only 5 ft 2 inches, and I feel very comfortable driving.
There are also very few blind spots. We love our Tribute (we call it the zoom zoom). I would highly
recommend it. It is also very sharp looking.
