            Hyundai Accent 2003

Hard to Accentuate the Positives.

Of all the Hyundai models I have driven the 2003 Accent is the one that impressed me the least. I realize that the Accent is a very economical car to drive and it is very inexpensive to purchase but to me it lacks in comfort, and worst it also has very no safety feature outside of the ones imposed by the department of transportation. 

I find it hard to write negative reviews about a product, if I do not like a particular product I have a terrible time getting inspired to write about it. But I will do my best to write an objective article about the Hyundai Accent 2003. 

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Hyundai model I test drove was the GS 2-doors hatchback. It is the most basic of the Accent models available. Consumers have 2 other choices aside from the GS. There is the GSi 2-door hatchback which will give you a more powerful engine plus added features such as fog lights, rear spoiler and sunroof and there is also the GL 4-doors available.

Even if Hyundai designers have increased the width and length of the Accent 2003 and reinforced its structure to me it is still an automobile that needs a lot of improvement to satisfy my minimal requirements of hat I consider a comfortable and safe car should have.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

One thing that is positive and one of the only few standard equipment the Accent GS comes with is a tilt steering. For me in this car it is a must, because the headroom and legroom in the front seat area is limited and without a tilt steering it would be very hard to enter and exit the car.

The seats are comfortable enough but only for short drives, I do not think that going on a long trip in this vehicle would be a pleasure. The rear legroom is even smaller than the front legroom. In the rear seats passengers are limited to 32.8 inches of legroom only.

Aside from the tilt steering the only other standard equipment was the rear window defrost. This car was so basic that even the radio had to be purchased as an option.

From the driver&#146s position the all around vision was excellent. All the gauges are easy to see and read and all the controls and buttons are easy to reach.

Considering that the Accent GS is a very inexpensive car to buy, the quality of the materials and the quality of the workmanship are very good.

The exterior:

Considering again that the 2003 Accent GS is a hatchback, the exterior not so bad looking. Usually I find that hatchback have a disproportionate look and I find most of them to be odd looking. But this Hatchback resembles more a 2-door car than a regular Hatchback.

I do like the side view mirrors; they do give the driver an excellent view of on-coming traffic and a minimal blind spot.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Under the hood the 2003 Hyundai Accent 2-doors GS has:

Engine: A 1.5-liter motor developing 92 horsepower.
Transmission: 5-speed manual.
Brakes: Front disc, rear drum.
Tires: 155/80R13   
Safety: Driver side airbag only.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Although I knew I was not going to enjoy that much I still took the Accent out for a spin. I drove OK, but keep in mind that it was a new car. The car I drove was very basic with no equipment whatsoever. I could be a car for running back and forth to the mall but remember it does not even have passenger side airbag.

I just can not recommend a car that has so few safety features.
