            You know a lot of people just don't trust the quality of American-made automobiles, although many don't realize that most Japanese brand cars are made in the U.S. (Honda, Toyota, etc.)  Many of Dodge's new and newer line of cars are made with mostly Mitsubishi parts, as the Dodge company actually owns 25% of Mitsubishi.  If you are interested in the Avenger, pop the hood and you'll see Mitsubishi stickers and tags everywhere.  Personally, I'd trust Mitsubishi parts before I would Dodge, and many of you out there might too.

The Dodge Avenger is one of the sportiest cars Dodge has made in a LONG time.  It is low to the ground, sleek, and still remains roomy, as many 'sporty numbers' often tend to be cramped.  It has been around for a few years now and you can get one with a LOT of stuff on it for less than $20,000.  I just purchased mine recently because Dodge is offering a $1,000 rebate off sticker price through the end of July.  They just knock off a grand right from the top.  Cool.

The Avenger comes with a peppy little 2.5 liter V6 Mitsubishi motor.  I think it's the same thing they use in the Galants and/or Mirages, but I can't say for sure.  It gets 20 mpg in city and 27 on the highway, which is a bit above average for a car its size.  The engine is also fairly quiet, which is something I enjoy.  I am not one of those rednecks who feels more manly when people a 1/2 mile away can hear his car or truck coming.

The Avenger also has ample room in front and back.  The back seat is tilted back a bit, so the rear passenger's knees will be pointing more upwards than forwards, and you don't have to worry as much about your knees rubbing the back of the front seats.  Also, the dashboard does not stick out very far, which makes for both passenger and driver to be able to slide the seats up enough for really tall people to fit comfortably in the back.

If you are looking for something sporty but don't want to pay sports car prices, you may want to look into the Dodge Avenger.  Dodge is offering a great $1,000 incentive through the end of July, so if you are in the market, give one of these babys a test drive.  It is guaranteed to turn heads.<br><br>
