            Wow, what can I say this car is the best car I have ever had it is so great. It is very comfortable on long trips and a perfect ride it is so comfortable and also very quiet it is great five people fit in the car pretty nicely. It has so many great features and a lot of nice toys to use. It has nice acceleration. Its styling is also very attractive. I love its slick curves. The leather interior is also a very nice add in. The sound system is also very nice it feels like you are right in the middle of a concert no matter what kind of music you are playing.<br><br>
