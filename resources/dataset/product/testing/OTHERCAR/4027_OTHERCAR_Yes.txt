            Looking for a vehicle that is durable,easy to manuver yet has a touch of class? The Tahoe has all of this and then some.  It is made for family fun and cruising and will not let you down in the winter weather. No more getting stuck in parking lots and streets not plowed.You will drive right through with out a second thought.

 Gas mileage not to shabby either. Because it is not as large as a suburban or full size van, you won't be spending as much on gas. It is bigger than a smaller version such as a blazer or bronco so you will not have a problem with interior room and comfort. It's roomy interior makes long rides and trips comfortable and enjoyable.

 When you compare prices with the Ford Expedition you will find that the Tahoe is substantially cheaper and more affordable. Another advantage to owning one would be the two doors in back. Some suv's have a hatchback,I like the double doors better.So over all this is the best suv I've seen yet and you will be just as pleased if you purchase one.<br><br>
