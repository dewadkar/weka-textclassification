            As soon as I heard that Volkswagen was remaking the Beetle, I knew one day I would have one.  One year after that day came, all I can say is &quot;Wow!  This puppy rocks!&quot;.  I purchased a royal blue 1999 New Beetle with black leather interior, manual transmission, six CD-changer, and a spoiler, and I constantly get remarks on how sleek my car looks.  Add that to the fact that it drives excellently (although my stick and clutch skills definitely need improvement) and you've got one heck of a car!  My only complaint is the size of the cab (it seats four people, but two average-sized adults in the front leave very little leg room in the back).  Also, I like to bring along soda pop in a cup when I'm driving, and the cup holders, being under the radio, can only accommodate an aluminum can or very small cup.  That little problem shouldn't bother most drivers, however.
All in all, for under $20,000, this car is one great deal, and it's SOOOO fun to drive!  I would recommend it to anyone!  As a matter of fact, I think I'm trading in my blue one for a green convertible New Beetle, if they ever come out!<br><br>
