            I LOVE this vehicle.  I have the LX version of this roomy vehicle.  From the outside it looks just like a normal sized vehicle.  Once inside though, you will be amazed by the amount of space the back seat has.  The accord drives amazingly quiet.  You feel at great ease, a feeling that this car will NEVER break down, because of the smoothness of the engine.  I quickly refinanced this car.  The bank gave me a blue book value of around $2o,ooo but I owed more than that.  Because of the quality of this vehicle the bank went ahead and refinanced for about $1500 more than its actual value.  They know that the accord last forever and is a great car.  The only downside of this car is the small pickup that the 4 cylinder has.  To get the true horsepower of the accord you have to go about $4000 more and get the EX version.  You get a great car for the money though!<br><br>
