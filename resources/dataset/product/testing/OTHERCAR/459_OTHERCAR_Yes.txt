            Product Rating:  I bought this camera at Target for $200 and it included a $50 Target gift card, so to me it's like $150.  Overall this camera takes outstanding pictures for the price.  I've owned 2 other digital cameras that cost more and the quality of the pictures wasn't as nice as this camera.  

 Ease of Use:  The camera is very easy to use right out of the box.  Instructions are well laid out which you will want to read to learn all the features.  I did have one problem trying to use the software that came with the camera.  I would receive an error message when trying to go into the program.  I went to the Kodak website and right there under the FAQ's was the solution to my problem basically deleting a certain folder in the software.   The camera also comes with a video option and sound, of course this is a low res video but the camera does have the option.  

Durability:  Over the camera is built well.  The only thing I can see to be a problem is the cover where the USB cable goes in, it's very flimsy.  

Battery Life:  We all know that the battery life is not the greatest for digital cameras but this one isn't that bad and it only takes 2 AA's at a time. 
    
Photo Quality:  Again this is the greatest feature of this camera.  the photos are so crisp and clear even on lower settings, such as "good".    

Shutter Lag - This one I don't worry about too much, it does have a little shutter lag, about a couple seconds but it's nothing that I don't mind.
