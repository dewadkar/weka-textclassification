            I was looking for a good affordable used vehicle that was capable of carrying at least a half ton of cargo, and being towed behind a motorhome without special modifications. My 95 Cherokee Sport has proven to be a good choice. It has driven 12,000 flawless miles since purchased. The average fuel mileage has been 16.5 mpg for those 12,000 miles. It has been towed another 12,00 miles as well, and these do not advance the odometer. Towing it is as easy as hooking up the tow bar and lights, putting the transfer case in neutral and the key in the ignition. I've towed it at speeds up to 85mph with no problems. I have only had to do normal maintainence, no repairs! It cruises at highway speeds nicely. Lots of pep in the 4.0L engine. Negatives are; the braking is a bit weak, it tends to lock up a tire easily on wet surfaces. The windshield angle causes it to pit easily. The back seat is serviceable for passengers but tight, long distance back there would be hard. The seatbelts don't retract well and like to get caught in the door.
All in all it has been a good vehicle for the money. I have yet to take it off road...
