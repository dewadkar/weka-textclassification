            Out of Smyrna, Tenn. comes the powerful V6 Altima.  The SE is the only V6 powered model in the Altima line.  It's the car that is turning heads on our roads.  In fact, this is the first major redesign of the Altima by this automaker.  Based on what I found out during my test drive, I will say that it's going to be a very powerful competitor to beat on the market.  Hello, Passat, Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry SE and Honda Accord EX V-6, here comes Nissan in all its glory and performance!  There is no doubt that this Altima can compete very well against the previously mentioned models.  What is good is that we, consumers, end up benefitting from well-built, reliable and feature-packed cars.  The Nissan Altima is worth every single penny.  You will understand that it's a good buy when you consider some of its key features.

<b>The Altima is a true joy to drive:  How did my tester react to my requests on the road?</b>

On a recently overcast Central California afternoon, I set out to enjoy the Nissan Altima.  In fact, the fog curtains that blanketed the Valley floor had just been lifted.  First things first, I checked the interior cabin to see how I am going to fit in.  I will admit that this car is as roomy as any other car on the market.  I am thinking about the great head, leg and hip room ordinarily found on the Honda Accord.  Being a big, tall guy, I could fit in my frame without any problems.  I enjoyed the fully powered, firm and comofortable driver's seat and the steering wheel that telescopes and tilts, providing you with the ability to find a good driving position.  I left the driver's seat, went over to the passenger's side and also sat in the rear seat to gauge comfort and security.  Whatever seating position I occupied, I found enough room for all the limbs.  The only thing that I noticed in the cabin has to do with the plastic materials used in the cabin.  There is also the question of the two levers found on the left side of the steering column.  They are there to control the wheel's tilts and telescopic adjustments.  I will admit that I was taken aback by them.  One lever can get and has gotten the job done all those  years.  Why two of them now?  At the same time, I will quickly add these are petty issues when considering the overall great features of the 2003 Nissan Altima.

On the road, the 6-cylinder with the four-speed automatic performed very well.  It has a balanced and refined powertrain.  The 240-hp, 3.5-liter V6 engine generates so much power that you will remain speechless and bewildered.  Later on, I also tried the 5-speed manual transmission one because I have always enjoyed their roughness and delivery.  In addition, displays and controls are well placed and lit.  In a few words, they are well thought out.  Storage on the SE is very abundant.  There are lots of bins, cubbies and pockets that will accommodate most of your small belongings.  No big deal!  Big dual cupholders really complement the best armrest in this class.  Up/down, front/rear adjustments make this armrest comfortable for anybody on the steering wheel.  You will love the two storage bins built into the armrest.  

<i>Trunk Space</i>

The trunk is pretty big. It can hold most of suitcases and bags you'll ever need to haul.  If you want to relocate to a new area of the country, you can fit in most of your belongings in the trunk.  Keep in mind that the rear seat is a 60/40 split that can add lots of versatility to your trunk.  The trunk has a glow-in-the dark, inside emergency release.

<b>What else should we know about this redesigned Nissan Altima?</b>

<i>Safety Features</i>

Antilock brakes, side air bags and side-curtain bags are some of the safety features you will find on the Nissan.  Front and rear head restraints will protect you against whiplash.  Just expect all other ordinary safety features in a car of this class.

Basic warranty:  3-year/36,000 mile; bumper-to-bumper powertrain: 5 year/60,000 mile.

<b>Final thoughts</b>

I had lots of fun with my tester.  The 2003 Nissan is a great car to drive.  I would recommend it to anybody looking for a new car.
