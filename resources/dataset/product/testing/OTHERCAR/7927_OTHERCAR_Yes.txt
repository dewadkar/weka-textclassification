            I recently came to the decision that I needed a new car well actually my old car decided to finally keel over and instead of dumping more money into the pit I went to the dealership.

Honestly I wasn't overly impressed with the design of the car.  Don't get me wrong it's very cute but nothing special pops out until you add more money for a wing then it looks much cuter.  I also opted for the EX model which comes with a sunroof and adds a little bit more charm.

With the EX model I also received a few extra items which made it even better.  My car has a v-tech engine, over head cam, nicer wheels, keyless entry, and a cd player.  None of these options came with the lower models.

I have had the car for two months now and I am amazed at how much I enjoy driving it.  I put gass in it less than once a week and drive a little over 300 miles on it with the AC on.  Bumps in the road that my old car seemed to produce out of thin air have vanished, the AIr conditioner is extra great since my old car blew out hot air all of the time and the brakes could stop on a dime

I really have to hand it to Honda.  They make a very cute  car for a very affordable price.  With options it becomes even cuter and I'm not embarassed to drive down the road in it.  I can easily fit my friends or family in the back seat (it helps that they aren't very tall lol!)if I need too.  And through Honda's financing I got a greta deal on financing at 4.99% which is wonderful since I'm still a college student with not a whole lot of credit established.
