            I had a Buick Regal Gran Sport before I got my SUV.  I loved it.  It is a beautiful car and looks very classy.

It was maroon/burgandy color. It had all leather interior.  All the controls for the radio were on the steering wheel.  It had tilt and cruise, power seats and power door locks.  It also had one of these remotes to lock and unlock the doors and pop the trunk. It has four doors.

It had an AM/FM radio with cassette player.  It was an automatic with the gear shift between the front seats in the floor.  It has a console in the middle of the seats.  The seats. front and back, are very comfortable.  You could ride forever on these seats.  

It was a six cylinder and it would flat get up and go.  It had heat and air and it always worked.  I wouldn't want to forget my favorite part, the sunroof.  It was the first car I had ever had with a sunroof.  I loved it.

It has sporty type wide tires.  It rode smooth, no bumps or shakes.  It was like riding on air.  It was comfortable to drive and ride.  It never gave me any problems.

We bought it in Union City, Tennessee at Terry Petty Chevrolet.  I had it for about two years.  We paid about $8,000.  Onyx Acceptance Corporation financed the car for 3 years.  The payment on it was about $240.00.

This is a great car.  It looks sporty but yet as a certain family look to it.

I recommend this car to all.  You really have to drive one.

Thanks for reading and have a great night!
