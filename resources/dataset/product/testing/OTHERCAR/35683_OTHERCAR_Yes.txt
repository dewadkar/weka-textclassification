            As a teenage driver, I was definitely not looking for fancy when I purchased my first car just over a year ago. I was looking for reliability, safety, and basic transportation. I bought a used 1995 two door Toyota Tercel for just over $5000 (maybe I should say my parents bought it -- but I do pay for insurance!), and I have to say that it was one of the most sound investments my family has ever made.

The car is basic -- no power locks, no power windows, no fancy gadgets, hell, I don't even have power steering -- but what I do have is a car that I know I can rely upon even in the worst of weather. I drove that car through a treacherous New York State winter, and I don't have a single complaint. Even without being stored in a garage, it was always easy to start in the mornings, it warmed up relatively fast (that's a major bonus!), and it navigated snowy, slushy roads without a hitch. I never fishtailed or skidded, never had a problem with breaks, and I always felt completely confident that I was safe. 

I have put 10,000 miles on my car in a year, needless to say, I drive a lot, and I have yet to make a repair (knock on wood). Aside from a minor seatbelt problem (read: my driver's seat seatbelt buckle no longer works properly, but it's pretty safe if you jiggle it a little), and blown out speakers (which I desperately wish I had the money to fix), the car is doing just fine. 

I haven't gotten into an accident yet where I would be able to comment on the durability of the car under in that type of situation -- thank God! -- but what I do know is that the breaks work really really well when someone cuts you off. In fact, they're probably the reason I'm here writing this opinion right now instead of in a hospital bed on life support. And so, on that note, I would have to say that this car has truly been a life saver, and in more ways than one!
