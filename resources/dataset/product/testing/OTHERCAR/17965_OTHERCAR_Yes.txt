            The 1998 Jeep Wrangler is probably the best jeep for the money. It is possible to find this car for under 10,000 which makes it affordable to many people. The durability is excellent and the style is unmatched by another other company.

I have been the owner of two 1998 Jeep Wranglers, and have had both good and bad experiences with both. My first one was a manual transmission, which was my main problem with it. Although I am fully capable of driving a manual car, I still had some trouble with it. Off road was definitely not joyful with the manual transmission, too much shifting to enjoy the ride. On the other hand, my current Jeep is an automatic. Now with an automatic, it is very easy to enjoy driving this car. Off road and on road, it gets an A+ for gratification.

Be advised, this type of vehicle is not for everyone. It drives more like an SUV then a car. The acceleration is poor, and you have to take turns extremely slow to avoid rolling. If you're the type of person who enjoys the thrill of a fast car flying in and out of traffic, then forget about a Wrangler.

My personal favorite feature of the Jeep Wrangler is the changeable tops. On a nice summer day, you can remove the top completely and enjoy a relaxing convertible. If its raining or just not looking so great out, then you have the choice of a hard top or a soft top. Both have their own unique styles suitable for almost anyone. The soft top is more laid back while the hard top is a little more rigid. I enjoy changing the top frequently, it gives the car some extra variety that isn't found in any other kind.

Overall, I am fully satisfied with the Jeep Wrangler and highly recommend it if you are looking for this type of vehicle.
