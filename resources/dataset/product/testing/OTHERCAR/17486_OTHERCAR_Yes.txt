            Having 4 young kids, I have no choice but to buy a VAN. The question is which one? I have no faith with the Ford Windstar, and the Dodge Caravan, seems so flimsy. So, having seen a TV commercial about the Kia Sedona 2002, we went to Rancho Kia in Clairemont to test drive one. The ride is smooth. The engine is so powerful and the steering is very easy to handle. We decided to purchase the top of the line model, complete with leather seats, moon roof , power door and window locks and the CD player.  The price for this model is $22,000 out the door and I think its a pretty good deal.

My kids love the fact that all of them have their own space. Nobody gets upset that they are seated too close together. It is really very convenient. Along with the dual sliding doors, my kids can just sit in their own spaces by themselves. What a time saver. 

The air-conditioning system is also fabulous. Having 2 sets of control, they can personalize the degree of coldness or heat that they want. The gas consumption is fair. And I like the fact that it only uses the 87 grade. 

I highly recommend the Kia Sedona 2002 for anyone in the market for a reliable family van. You won't regret it.
