            <b>Overview</b>
the 1992 Prelude is the first of the 4th gen preludes, and its an absolute blast to drive. The first thing that strikes you when you get in is the low down driver position (although i was adjusting from driving a RAV4) and the driver-oriented interior. All information is very well spaced out along the length of the dash, and is quite visible. 

the only complaint i have about the interior, is the parking brake warning light can be hidden behind your hand, which has led to driving with the e-brake on. The car has a very strong idle when cold, and can easily overpower a non-adjusted e-brake. Once you begin to drive the prelude, you are greatly surprised by the responsiveness of the vehicle, its like the perfect meld of car and driver. 

<b>Performance</b>
Don't get me wrong, this car is plenty quick, but for real muscle you'd be better off with a Camaro. The handling of this car is amazing. My car has been lowered, and its steadiness through turns is just fabulous. Its handling is just beautiful, although once again im comparing to a RAV4. But even compared to my friend's 94 camaro, and a 2002 Sentra SE-R Spec-V with a limited slip differential, i would still say my handling compares rather favourably. The 92 Prelude predates DOHC VTEC, but it still has tons of torque in the high RPM range. The butterfly valves mean that the car will still experience a huge jump in power at full throttle. The automatic transmission will almost redline it, and the car will roar as you are pulled back in your seat.

The car, in my humble opinion, looks beautiful. It has a very low aggressive stance which has to be seen to be appreciated. Having it parked in your driveway will attract some glances. And it is a blast to drive, but doesnt break enough to really be much fun to work on. 

<b>practicality</b>
the gas mileage isnt bad, but it could be better. obviously if you want the car to pull a bit, it'll start guzzling gas as it gets into the 4000-6500 RPM range. I get around 21-23 mpg in all-city driving, so its really not so bad. I also drive a bit faster than necessary, which is probably a big factor. I just recently installed a cold air intake, and my gas milage has greatly improved, as has the performance of this car. I'd say Im now getting 25-27 mpg, AND I'm driving more aggressively than before.

<b>luxuries</b>
NO back seats. whatsoever. they say its a 2 plus 2, its a 2 plus "put your bag in the back seat" there is 1" of leg room in the back if 6-footers sit in the front. those who say they could fit kids in there, didnt have the seat most of the way back. and the glove box is also tiny. and there are no cup holders. if those things are important to you, buy a Lexus or something like that. 

<b>roominess</b>
I removed my back seats, and so now I have a trunk that goes all the way though, and gives me enough space to cart around 2x4s. There is still plenty of room up front, in fact more than the Rav4 has.

<b>tuning</b>
If you are looking for a car with a lot of aftermarket potential, you may want to look for a lighter car. Although this car isnt heavy, the aftermarket seems to have given up on it. Once you get a cold air intake and a header (which is good for maybe 10-15hp), you're only route towards more performance is in the $3000 range. Either a turbo kit, a built motor, or a 5th gen VTEC engine swap.
