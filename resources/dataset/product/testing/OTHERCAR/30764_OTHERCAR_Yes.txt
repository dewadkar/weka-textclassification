                 I do some freelance writing for a skydiving related website.  The webmaster sent me an Olympus D-340R so I could add some color to my articles.  I've had this camera for five months now and I love it!
     After spending some time with the owner's manual and playing with the various features this camera is easy to use.  It is best used for snapshot style photos; even in the telephoto mode you have to be close to your subject to get a really good shot.  
     The lowest resolution - 640 x 480 - produces pictures that are great for web use.  The highest resolution - 1280 x 960 - can be used with standard compression (resulting in a smaller file size), minimal compression (larger file size) or no compression (largest file size - up to 4 MB).  With minimal compression the photos I've taken printed very nicely on standard paper with a basic ink jet printer.  An 8MB Smart Medial card will hold around 120 pictures in the lowest resolution.
     The camera has a lot of extra features.  The telephoto mode lets you get a good picture from further away, although it operates only in the lowest resolution.  Also available are macro and panorama modes and automatic sequential shooting.
     My camera came with an 8MB Smart Media card and cable for downloading pictures to a computer.  I've yet to run out of room on the card, but I generally shoot in the lowest resolution.  Downloading can be slow.  I'm planning to purchase the Smart Media Floppy disc adaptor for faster access to the pictures.  The adaptors are available for around $100 from various online and offline sources.
     For longest battery life the manual recommends minimal use of the included LCD screen.  I use the LCD screen to view my pictures often which means I have to replace the batteries on a regular basis - generally a new set won't last much more than a weekend.  Rechargeable batteries would help reduce this expense.  
     At under $300 the Olympus D-340R is a great entry level digital camera.  It is perfect for those who need or want a digital still camera with a number of features but don't want to spend a lot.
