            Most people love the Nikon cameras, and why not?  Nikon is obviously a top-notch manufacturer of all things photographic, and not the cheapest, so you expect a good product - and get it.

There are several reviews that list all the features - and there are a great many features.  Of course its a versatile full-featured camera that takes great pictures.  That's a given.  But here are some things that tend to get overlooked in most reviews that make the camera special:

First off, it *is* a Nikon.   That means Nikon engineering when it comes to the optics, and that is VERY important.  There are a lot of players in the Megapixel Wars, but I've tried several and - believe me - pixel for pixel, the Nikon images come out a lot better.   It also means Nikon quality when it comes to the design and manufacture.  Early on, I had another big-brand-name digital camera which broke in six months.  The manufacturer's estimated repair cost was more than I paid for the camera. I've had a Nikon Coolpix 950 for several years without the tiniest problem.  Now I have upgraded to the 4500 and like what I see.  QUALITY!

Second, the controls are complex because the camera does so much, but pretty much mimic the Nikon 35mm cameras.  That is important to me, since I don't have to learn a whole different set of rules.   You can set the camera so that your average shot just requires a quick point-and-shoot, but if you want, you can get VERY fancy with the controls.  I *love* the fact that Nikon uses the half-depressed shutter button to freeze the automatic focus and exposure, so I can quickly and easily compose a difficult backlit or off-center shot and get perfect settings simply by aiming first at the subject, freezing the controls, then re-aiming and pressing the shutter button the rest of the way.  WONDERFUL!  

What about that swivel design?  Just a gimmick?  No no no.. What that does is allow you to align the optics one way for shooting, and another for storage.  Nearly every other camera I've seen has a lens sticking out the front.  My Coolpix will fit in the back pocket of my jeans, even the ones with the 30" waist - although in that case I am left with a Coolpix imprint on my right buttocks for several hours afterwards.  There's not a chance I could do that with a lens poking out the front of the camera.  VERY HANDY!

Something that most people don't notice until its too late is the time it takes between pictures.  The Nikons have always been *fast*.  Fast enough to do their "best shot" technique, which is to let the camera take 16 shots in rapid succession when you depress the shutter, then let you decide which one is best.  I have taken a lot of images one right after the other, just like I used to do with my 35mm Nikon.  I have yet to find another digital that was that fast.  (technically, it requires a fast processor and large buffer to hold images, which lesser cameras don't have.)  Let me tell you, this is a lifesaver if you just took a shot and realize that an even better shot is in front of you. One big advantage of digital cameras is that you can "waste" as many shots as you wish to get the good one - no film to worry about.  This camera is great for capturing those fleeting moments!

There are some tiny improvements Nikon has made over the 950, too, which few people mention - like the fact that the memory card is a LOT easier to remove from the camera.  I put some tape on the end of my card so I could get it out of my 950.  With the 4500, its no problem.  And the automatic shutoff prevents me from leaving the camera on and draining the battery for no reason.   The setting for adapter lenses are also nicer.  I could go on and on, but...  

There are lots of good reasons for choosing this camera.  I've tried to hit some of the ones you DON'T see people mention most of the time. There's a lot more to this camera than just Megapixels and a feature list.  Yes, its a little more expensive than some of the competition, but well worth it.  You just don't hear anyone say "I'm sorry I bought this Nikon."
