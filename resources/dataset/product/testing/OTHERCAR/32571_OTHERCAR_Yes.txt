                    My brother just picked up one of these for $10,000. I was kind of against saturn. I never really heard anything bad of them but cars that are made of plastic just dont seem like they would be good to me.

       But that plastic or what ever they make there cars out of is amazing. I let a hard punch go out right into the door. Not even a dent, I was amazed. Then I found out you could kick the panels to and nothing would happen.

       Supposedly saturns have steel frames in them that have an effect like a roll cage. So its a safe car? I believe so. What about the engines though thats the important part right.

       Well my brothers has a 5-speed with the optional twin cam. I must say that has some power behind it. One time out with that car and I was reving the engine at every car I saw. It has kick. Especially in the higher gears once the twin cam kicks in. Although there is a problem and from what I hear from mechanic friends of mine is that it happens in most saturns its transmission has a problem with 3rd gear and sometimes will just pop out of gear. Other than this its a good car. I had a 92 sl1 and put 175,000 and wherever that car is its still running I think. So longevity is good too.<br><br>
