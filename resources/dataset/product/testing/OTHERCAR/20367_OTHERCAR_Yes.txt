            Having had a Mazda MPV and needing a vehicle that was used half the time on northern highways and gravel roads with ice and snow, and  half the time in the city with the need for safety and good fuel economy I was looking for 4WD and a smaller footprint than the usual SUV. I had rented Explorers, Blazers and found them too &quot;choppy&quot; and harsh, with limited interior space and poor economy, especially after a mini-van with removable seats. I test drove the RAV4 and Honda's CRV and found the interior finishes cheap and sparse, and the ride weak on the highway with plenty of noise. The Tribute was appealing for it's good fuel economy for 200 hp, 4WD, car like ride, and if it was built like my MPV, a flawless construction. 

It's been three months of active use now and I'm very satisfied with the overall purchase. Initial price was excellent; I bought the fully loaded leather, moonroof, trailer package 4WD at less than $35,000 CDN. The dealers are not negotiable on price, they love the demand. I really like the power; acceleration is excellent and it's handling is as carlike as I've seen in this category. Fuel economy has been steadily improving as it ages, but has stabilized at a respectable 26 mpg highway (fast in a loaded vehicle, about 22 mpg in US gals), and 21 mpg city (about 18 mpg in US gals). Interior finish is fine, great sound system, handling on rough gravel roads is  great, very rough roads is poorer but not unexpected. Power moonroof is fun at lower speeds or off road, and the split gate back has proven useful. Negatives are the interfering gear selector with the radio, two inches shorter would solve the problem, how about an after market fix? Wind noise from the mirrors is surprising and unneccessary, seems like a design oversight. 

Driving this vehicle is still great fun and it is challenging to remain nonchalant when other people are staring and thinking, what is THAT? It is so peppy I have to restrain my desire to rip away from lights. It has yet to earn it's stripes through a full blown Alberta winter but early indications are very good. I hope the Ford factory building Mazda designed vehicles in Kansas City will live up to Mazda's reputation for tank like construction. There are occasional plastic twitters from interior body panels but they seem to go away. Time will tell.

This is a vehicle for an older four person or less family who no longer needs the extra roominess of a van, but likes the tight car like feel and nimbleness of 200 hp in a reasonably light bodied truck. Fuel economy is not sacrificed for a strong 6 cylinder engine (forget about the fours). Full time front wheel drive automatically shifting to four when needed is good for most drivers, handles better in rain and snow and is more economical than rear wheel drive. The only real competition is the Subaru Outback 6, but it doesn't have the same high road &quot;presence&quot; and feel. This is not a vehicle for families who carry lots of stuff, really no SUV is as the storage space is always amazingly small. But it definitely is a vehicle for boomers in the 00's who want four wheel drive fun, economy, and versatility for a great price!
