            I bought my 1999 Cougar in October 1998 and thought that the car would be reliable, stylish, affordable, and fun since it was a new car.  Little did I know that it would be anything but reliable.  I should have known better to buy a first year model and the dealership even admitted that they had many problems with the 1999 model.  The Following is a list of what went wrong in the 9 months I had my Cougar...

A)  The &quot;check engine&quot; light would come on randomly, and the dealership could never fix it.

B)  The brakes would grind and make horrible noises, until Ford (the maker of the Cougar) recalled the original brakes and replaced several parts.

C)  The windsheild was not correctly set, and it caused the paint to crack all around the windsheild.  The dealership figured this out after several attempts of fixing the cracks. 
 
D)  The outside weather strip moldings had to be replaced 3 times because of problems with it either leaking or falling off.

E)  The inside weather strip moldings had to be replaced 2 times because of leaking.  

F)  The engine coolant tank had to be replaced 2 times because of TWO faulty tanks.  

G)  The stereo had to be replaced 3 times because of malfunctions.  

H)  The CD changer in the trunk had to be replaced after it just quit one day.

I)  The sunroof had to be replaced and the guiding tracks also because of sound and leaks.

J)  RUST!  See Below...

Listed above are the major things that went wrong with the car besides the typical rattles and squeaks.  I believe that I received a lemon, until one day I was waiting and started talking to a gentleman who also had a Cougar.  He had also had many of the same problems with his vehicle and was trading it in soon.  I found a newsgroup ( alt.autos.mercury.cougar ) and started to research these problems.  It seemed that there were many problems with the Cougar.

On the newsgroup a man had problems with his car rusting on the undercarriage and around the wheels.  I found my flashlight and looked under my Cougar and sure enough I had MAJOR rust all over.  I live in Las Vegas and the car had never been rained on, and had only gotten wet when I washed it.  After realizing that my car was rusting prematurely I started looking for a new car.

The Cougar was very fun to drive and had more power than I thought It would have.  The styling of the Cougar is great and very modern.  It was a fun car to have while I had it.  The reliability of the vehicle is not worth owning one.  

I had a loaner car probably 40% of the time I had my Cougar.  I would warn buyers out there to think twice before buying a 1999 Cougar.
