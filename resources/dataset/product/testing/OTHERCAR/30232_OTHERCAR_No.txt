            I decided to try out a digital camera to replace my 35 mm &quot;Zenit&quot;. I went in search of a cheap digital camera, because I have not experience with this cameras. I was not expecting a high quality. Not thinking that it was a wise investment, but I wanted to try.

I bought my first digital camera Agfa ePhoto Smile for 95 dollars (in Belarus). This was the least expensive digital camera with flash and only one under 100 dollars.

My first images were a little pixellated, but they're of a reasonable quality for this price. What I wanted - 640 X 480 output is maximum. So I opened a image in Adobe Photoshop software. A few minutes and result was not bad.

A few remarks about other features. The camera only holds 16 pictures - it's not enough, if you a far from home. There is no display, so I could see your photos only later. But included a ten second timer - it's good for cheap camera. The flash has four options - on, off, automatic, red
eye fill, and works very well.

Finally, I think the Agfa ePhoto Smile is a very good introduction to digital photography. This is a simple camera to quickly capture an image or two. And children, especially my daughter 9 years old, were glad to
work (or, may be, play) with this camera.<br><br>
