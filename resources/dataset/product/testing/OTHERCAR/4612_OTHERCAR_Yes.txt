            I've owned this car a tad over 18 months. It's not my daily driver so every time I go into the garage, I get this stupid grin. The car is an awesome triple black 6 speed coupe. I had the exhaust upgraded to an aftermarket brand. Upon startup the engine just hums with a slight edgy growl. Hit the accelerator and it will wake up the neighbors. I enjoy the features that allow the seat to slide back and the steering column to move. It eases getting in and out of an already low car. The stereo system is mediocre at best, however, I added some tweeters to the rear mid range speakers which have made all the difference in the world for a $20.00 upgrade. The 12 Disk changer located in the trunk is extremely slow. It'll take a while to go between disks, but what's a few seconds? I've managed to modify my stock shifter with an aftermarket Hurst shifter. All I can say is that I've never missed a shift yet! Another modification I made to the car was to change the intake air system. I went from stock to a Donaldson's Blackwing. I'm not a gear head by any means but I did do some dynoing before and after the intake change. It was amazing!!! The car actually showed and increase of 22HP from the highest dyno run I had prior to the change over. I also noticed the car gets extremely good gas mileage. I've driven from St Louis to Chicago on a couple of occaisions running the A/C and still got between 26 and 29 mpg, and that was running between 75 - 85 mph all the way. Top removal is easy but it is a pain in the but for one person to do alone. It is manageable but one slip of the hand on the glass top and there goes about $ 1200.00. The Heads Up display is excellent. It puts the information you want where you need it. The cup holder's suck!!! Place a cup in them and you can't fiddle with the climate control. A big cup screws with your shifting. Watchout for this. The center console has an additional DC power outlet but what good is it? You can't close the console if you have something plugged into it. Also, it would be a pain in the rear to try to use a device within the console.
