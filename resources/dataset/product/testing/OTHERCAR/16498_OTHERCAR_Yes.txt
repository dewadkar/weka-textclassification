            I have a 1997 BMW 318ti. I have always looked at BMW's and wanted one, but I didn't think I could afford it.  In 1997, my lease ended on my Saturn SL2. I looked everywhere for a new car and I found the BMW 318ti due to my husband forcing me in to the lot. I honestly didn't think I could buy a BMW for $23,000.  After driving it, I loved it. It was very comfortable. The seat is really adjustable. I am 5'3 and my husband is 6' and both of us are comfortable. I get approximately 40 miles to the gallon. It runs great. It is quick and fun. It has been very dependable.  Absolutely no problems.  I spent $500 extra to cover my upholstery and paint with a protector that they apply and is guaranteed for 5 years. I ran over a nail about a year ago.  I was driving through a bad neighborhood with my daughter and was about 15 miles away from my parents house. I drove it all the way there with the flat.  Believe it or not, there was no damage at all.  I had the tire repaired that day. The tire was of the highest quality. It was really durable.  I have had flats with the saturn that left me stranded. Not with the beamer. My husband and I both feel good about it.
 The only problem that I had was with the different dealers.  I knew I would be dealing with them for a long time and I wanted a great deal so I went to several BMW dealers and that was an experience. I was very sick and I had 3 days before my lease on my Saturn would end. The first BMW was in Huntington Beach, California, the salesman spent more time putting down the vehicle that I currently had instead of telling me what they had to offer.  I then went to the one in Riverside and it was a wonderful experience. The salesman welcomed us and offered his assistance. He told us the difference between the vehicles and gave me the keys and told me to really drive it.  He never pushed the sale. He let the vehicle sell itself. I thanked Mr. Cairns for his time and left.  He didn't beg us to stay or push the sale. He just told my husband and I that if we had any additional questions or would like to test drive it again that he would be there for us.  I then went to BMW of Ontario.  They were very busy.  Needless to say, a man who said he was the manager told us after 30 minutes of waiting that he didn't sell cars, but we could wait for a sales person to finish with other customers.  We told him that we understood and would be right back. We went to GMC, Honda and a couple other dealerships in the area and returned.  The man who didn't sell vehicles was now selling a Z3 roadster to a customer.  Needless to say, I did share my opinion.  The manager took us up to the VIP lounge, bribed my daughter with an ice cream and we waited there on their black leather couches for 15 minutes.  After they ran my credit and realized how good it was they started kissing up and trying to up sell us to another vehicle. We told him what we wanted and then the slimy man started working the personal angle that he had kids too and then the hardsell came in and he said &quot; so when do you want to drive your new vehicle home&quot;. We told him we needed to think about it. I didn't want to deal with that kind of service. I went back to Riverside and bought my car and I have never been treated better.  The vehicle comes with a great warranty. The service is excellent.  They offered to give me a vehicle for the day with a 6 hour service. There was no cost for the service. The car is wonderful and don't give up in finding a great dealership. I am buying my car next month.<br><br>
