                 Once again I find myself compelled to write an opinion about the M-Class.  I have had my ML 430 for over a year now and have been to so happy with it and its performance.  The ML 430 has proven to be perfect for my active lifestyle.  
     As I travel a lot and am active in enjoying the great outdoors, the M-Class has proven to be the perfect choice for me.  For starters the spacious interior of the M-Class has afforded me great comfort and plenty of room when I have needed it the most.  It always seems that the cargo area my M-Class has more than enough space for all of my adventorous endeavors.  
     The superior off-road capabilities of the M-Class have allowed me to travel virtually anywhere.  There is no road to bumpy, no trail to rocky, no creep to deep and no hill to steep for my M-Class.  I can safely relie on my M-Class to get me anywhere that I want to go.
     I also greatly enjoy the fact that although the M-Class is a SUV great for the outdoors, it is also a perfect city driving vehicle.  I get good gas mileage.  The M-Class is also a very safe vehicle.  I simply can't seem to stress just how pleased I have been with this car.  I have enjoyed every minute of it.<br><br>
