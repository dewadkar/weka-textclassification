            I was so excited to get my Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GS convertible.  I bought a 1996 model, black with a black top, chrome rims,the works.  It was a beauty!  I drove it all around town, proud of my new baby.  About two months after I bought this dream car, the nightmare began.  
Incident #1-I was driving in Los Angeles in a not so great neighborhood and all of a sudden the car started making a strange noise.  Next thing I new, oil was leaking everywhere and I needed a brand new engine. The service department had just serviced the car, so I know that it was nothing that I could have caused.  They, however,put up a fight and until I could produce a receipt validating my servicing, they would not fix it under warranty.  The funny thing was that I got the service done at this dealership!  It's a good thing I keep receipts.  They then fixed the problem.  A few months went by and I had no problems.
Incident #2-Once again, driving in Los Angeles on the busy 5 Freeway something didn't sound right.  For weeks, a humming sound was coming from the engine.  That was the day the car could take no more.  About five minutes after I began driving, we heard a big crash and the car progressively stopped driving.  It felt like the whole bottom of the car was falling out.  Well, we got towed to the nearest dealership at 10:00 p.m..  The dealership was still open and we dumped the car there.  We were informed that they would take a look at it in the morning.  Nevertheless we were 90 miles from our San Diego home and needed a rental car.  Boy was the dealership nasty and uncooperative.  They have a rental department there, but a salesman told us, sorry, they are closed.  Ok, well how about giving us a ride to the nearest car rental place?  Sorry, we can't do that.  Ok, how about a phone book so we can call a cab?  Sorry, we don't have one!  Great Service!  At midnight, we walked to a gas station that called us a cab.  The next morning I got a call. My entire transmission blew.  I needed a whole new transmission and undercarraige.  The service representative said that the transmission grenaded under the car and we were lucky to be alive.  They would fix the problem, if I could once again produce proof that the car had been serviced properly.  Well, of course I had the receipt.  They fixed the $6000 problem 3 weeks later.
After two major catastrophes in less than a year, I hated this car.  As time progressed, it shook uncontrollably.  It made awful squeaking noises.  The top wouldn't go down. When you got it down it wouldn't go back up. This car was a nightmare.   
We even tried to go through the Lemon Law.  The Mitsubishi attorney told us to sue them.  It wasn't worth the hassle.
This is a piece of garbage.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR.  I had nothing but problems with it.  Unless you like throwing money in the garbage, stay away.  Now I have an Infiniti QX4 and what a difference.  Service is excellent and I haven't had a problem yet.  Good Luck!<br><br>
