            First of all, there is no reason that 40% of the cars on the road couldn't be built like this.  Blame OPEC and the hopelessly apathetic alternative-fuel vehicle divisions of the domestic auto makers.  I'm no tree hugger, but for daily driving, anything less suddenly seems really bloated.

Second, answers to the top three reservations about hybrid technology: 1) No, you don't have to plug it in; the battery is recharged by the braking system, which, along with the engine that auto stops at red lights to save fuel, is very cool.  2) No, it isn't gutless; as a commuter car, the 0-60 factor is all anyone needs.  3) No, it doesn't cost any more than a regular Civic EX and comes with all the same standard features.  In fact, with a $2,000 tax credit, it comes out a little cheaper and the Civic looks way better than the pimple-on-wheels Prius.

Third, this is just a car for reliable daily driving. That's it.  No one's trying to tackle the Autobahn here or impress the girl in the next lane.  It's A-to-B transportation that you don't have to think about.  There are enough reviews about Hondas here, so I won't go into ride and quality issues.  The appearance is Civic-standard, though the faux chrome instrument and shifter accents look a bit cheap. The dash lights - cool for some - seem a little overdone for this mild ride.  All 03 Hybrids are optioned the same, with no sunroofs or dark paint colors "to keep the cabin cool for the battery," though I suspect Honda wants to see how popular the car is first. (Answer: poor sales from those slow to adopt.  This may hurt resale values, even for a Honda, but if this makes you pause, you probably don't want to jump in the pool anyway.  C'mon, support the technology.)

If anything, the complaint has been that it looks too much like a "normal" Civic, from those who need a merit badge to show others their eco-consciousness.  Don't buy that either, the savings of 1 Hybrid can't keep up to the waste of a highway full of SUVs, but we're trying.  Even in heavy urban traffic with full A/C and 110-degree heat, I average 42 mpg - 15% less than manufacturer specs, but way better than most others.

What I like: Ample (though expected these days) standard features. Competitive price.  Quiet ride with (so far) solid construction.  Tax rebate. Cabin space and ease of entry/exit. Adequate acceleration for commuter driving.  CD. Push/pull design of gas door/trunk button. Headlight and taillight design. Rear spoiler and badging to differentiate the hybrid model. Floor mats. Coin drawer.  Cup holder design.  Surprising trunk space.

What I don't like:  Paint choices. Location of mirror, defrost and cruise switches on the left side, hidden by the steering wheel spoke--move these back to console or door handle.  Climate control switches are all the same shape, requiring the driver to look at them, taking eyes off the road until they are "learned."  Recessed ignition is hard to find by feel; trunk and door locks also seem small and weak. Rear seat is a little benchy and uncomfortable on long trips.  Auto A/C setting is clunky (blasts air on and off). Attempt at driver's armrest is half-hearted and clumsy.

Could do without:  Instantaneous gas mileage indicator.  Fewer pages devoted to child safety in the owner's manual.  Valet key. Theft and vandalism appeal of Honda models.

For later models: Prius-crushing gas mileage.  Locking glove compartment.  Improve console shifter (looks cheap and gear indicator is 'unnatural' and unclear with N and P marked in red; most of us still look there, not the dash, to see what gear we're in).  More/better trim options.  More seat pockets.  Add trunk to remote key functions.  Despite the battery: Sunroof, full accessory plug-in outlet (who ever really needs a 12V?) and a fold-down rear seat.
