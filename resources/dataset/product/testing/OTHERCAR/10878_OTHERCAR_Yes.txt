            I recently bought a 97 Pathfinder and I really love this SUV.  Its so sharp looking.  It runs unbelievably and its very roomy and comfortable.  At first I thought it was going to be diffucult to drive it because it's high up and bigger than the car I had before it.  Its so easy to drive.  It came with alot of little &quot;extra's&quot; like a CD player, a cellular phone, an alarm and its a 4X4, which really helps in a snow storm.  My son loves it and its very roomy for him in the back seat.  The back seat collapses down so there is more room if you need to load something large into the hatch.  

I have heard from other Nissan owners that these cars go for a whopping 250,000 miles, if not more, and they are so reliable and dependable.  I am so glad I decided on this awesome SUV.  I highly recommend checking one of these out if your in the market for a car or truck.<br><br>
