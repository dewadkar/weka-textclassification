                  The Jimmy we have in our family woks great as an sport utility vehicle to go up in to the mountains and then we can get home late in the afternoon and go out on the town.  This little car is of the best investments we have ever had, she pulls our boat with ease and hulls our camper trailer around as if it were pulling something so light, as in a jet ski.  I don't like the back seat cause with three kids it gets kind crowded back there and there might not be much butt room, but leg room wise it works out great.  If you don't think you are ever going to take it off road there are still things that you can do that would make it look like it could take on any mountain or pot hole.  There are a few things that have gone wrong but we just take it back to the dealer and they fix it free of charge.<br><br>
