            I have a 1995 Buick Skylark.  This car takes all the abuse I put on it.  I drive a delivery job in my car and put well over 100 miles on it each week.  I have only had to have the car majorly serviced once.  This car is very safe. In a head on collision it protected everyone in the car with only minor injuries.  The car is larger than some other cars in its class but it handles well. Curves are no problem for this car and it has lots of pickup.  The interior of the car is very comfortable. Everything is in reach of the driver.  The exterior is sporty without being overdone.  I recommend this car to anyone especially young drivers.<br><br>
