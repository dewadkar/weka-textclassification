            I recently shopped for a new car, and the Lincoln LS was on my &quot;short list&quot;, along with the Acura TL, Chrysler 300M and BMW 3-series.  The objective:  as much performance and luxury as possible for around $30k.

The LS is a huge step forward for Lincoln.  Given the Navigator's success in reaching a new demographic (younger, more adventurous buyers) it made perfect sense to go after the folks who normally buy German or Japanese luxury/performance cars.

The problem with the LS is that the Acura TL offers very similar performance (despite being front wheel drive) and, in my opinion, more luxury, for less money.  My guess is that the Acura will have fewer problems and better resale.

On the other end of the spectrum, you have the BMW 5-series and Lexus GS, which cost a little more than the Lincoln but are simply better cars.  And the resale of the BMW and Lexus will probably more than offset the difference in purchase price.  But the fact remains that the 528i and GS300 sell for around $40k, which is a little steep for most folks.

So Lincoln took a shot at the middle:  $35k.  Now for the details:

1) Performance:  the car handles well, steering is fine, brakes are excellent.  Acceleration is good with the V8 or the V6 manual.

2) Exterior styling:  front and sides are beautiful.  Love the mini-Navigator grill.  Back end is a little homely.  Looks too much like the Town Car.

3) Interior styling:  needs a lot of work.  I liked the Acura TL interior much more and it's far less expensive.  Nice seats, though.  Like the TL, you're in for a little embarrassment when your friends ask you &quot;what kind of wood is that?&quot;  (It's fake, and fairly obvious at that.  Worse yet, if you get the black interior, the fake wood really stands out.)

4) Stereo:  I've been an audiophile since I was 14, so I'm a little fanatical about my car stereos.  If you're not, simply disregard this paragraph.  The standard four speaker stereo is a joke.  It is an insult to put it in a $35 car.  If you get the Sport package, which I recommend for purposes of handling and styling, you'll get a 6 speaker &quot;Alpine&quot; system.  I put Alpine in quotes because at most they provide two of the six speakers and none of the electronics.  The power is limited (90 watts peak at 2% distortion) and there are no woofers.  That is a travesty, because the trunk of a sedan makes a great bass enclosure.  If you don't get the sport package, then you can get an optional 12 speaker, 175 watt Alpine system (with real Alpine speaker, including two woofers on the rear deck.)  Now we're talking!  Whether stuck in traffic or winding over a mountain road, you can hear all the instruments of a symphony in perfect balance or blast your brains out with Smashmouth.

The bottom line:  if you must buy American, look at the LS (made in Michigan) and the Acura TL (made in Ohio).  If you must have a manual transmission, buy a BMW.  If can afford it, get a BMW 528i or Lexus GS300.  If your really well off, go for the 540i or GS400.

Buying a new car is a big decision and I wish you success.

P.S. Not completely satisfied with any of the cars on my short list, I prolonged my shopping until I could afford a Lexus GS300.  (Performance is great, stereo sounds great, and the wood is bird's eye maple.)<br><br>
