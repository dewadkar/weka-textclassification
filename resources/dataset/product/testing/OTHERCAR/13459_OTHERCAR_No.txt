            Lets get started with what everyone see's.. The body is so so.. If it is washed it looks nice. It looks like a 1990 car.. The body is very tin like, if touched with any force the body will dent.. Don't ever get on the roof.. The features insides are pretty basic. They come with boring features and manual. 

Now the car is light.. If a gust a wind comes or you pass a semi you'll feel like your gonna wind up in the ditch. The head lamps frost over in witch makes it almost impossible to see at night let alone the rain.. I have done the most damage to my topaz becuase of it's shanty head lamps. If you want to get these repaired it will cost you close to 200$.

The car has many failures too. The tires wear out fast.. The transmitions has had problems with it numerous times.. The car usually had not gotten much serious problems but still anoying and expensive. The car had excellaration problems too.. You feel like your killing it trying to go the speed limit down the high way.. And passing people.. haha dont even try it. I recommend for first time car users. It has a good engine..
