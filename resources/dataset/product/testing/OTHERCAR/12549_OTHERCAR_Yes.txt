            On January 18th, 2001, Amber and I took ownership of a brand new Chevy Silverado K1500 Extended Cab, Short Wheelbase, Z-71 Off-Road Pickup. This was the best decision we ever made as far as a vehicle purchase.

This truck encompasses everything you would want. Awesome performance, 0-60 times that rival many cars, excellent torque, a smooth shifting transfer case, comfort, VERY ERGONOMIC (even Amber at 5'4" tall can drive it without problems)...

We've had the truck for 3 months now, and we have not had a single problem with ANYTHING. No new-truck quirks, nothing but rock-solid performance. Considering it's a 4x4, we get about 16 MPG around town, and we average driving it about 60 or 70 miles a day... On the highway, you have to watch that speedometer, because this truck runs out so smooth, that you will be doing 85 or 90 before you know it!

The 4WD unit has performed flawlessly, and we use it several times a week, especially in the rainy muddy weather of a North Texas Spring.

If you want a truck that is comfortable, affordable, great performing, stable, and in general, the best piece of US iron I've driven in a very long time, then test drive this one!

I've been a Chevy Fan all of my life, but this has reinforced my opinion ten-fold!

Note on the price we paid, we have a very close relative that has worked for GM for over 25 years, and we did get employee pricing.
