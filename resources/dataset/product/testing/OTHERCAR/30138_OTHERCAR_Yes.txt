            Test drove a Scion xA this week, after doing research on the web. The model I drove was equipped with the following options: an automatic transmission, floor/cargo area mats, and a 6 CD changer. Price as tested was $14,280. (Scions are sold with "no haggle" style pricing. The window sticker is what you pay.)

STANDARD EQUIPMENT

The Scion xA comes standard with A/C, tilt steering, power steering, power brakes, power mirrors, power windows, power door locks, a single CD player, a 6 speaker stereo, 60/40 folding rear seats, a cargo area cover and amazingly, Anti-Lock Brakes. Pretty decent list of standard equipment. 

INTERIOR

Seating is spartan, but comfortable. Obviously, a 15 minute test drive is not like a long road trip, but at 5'11" I had lots of room. Unless you are over 6 and 1/2 feet tall, I would guess you could find a comfortable driving position. The salesman I rode with was around 6'3" and didn't look cramped. I tried out the rear seats as well, and there was adequate leg room there for me as well. (I sat behind the drivers side seat as I had adjusted it. It would have been a little tighter behind the seat the salesman had adjusted.) The high profile of this ECHO derivative makes for an impressive amount of interior space given the size of the Scion. The cargo area is 11.7 sq ft by the book, with a small amount of underfloor storage with the spare tire. The Scion comes standard with a retractable cargo cover.

Two negatives: 1) The only interior color available is "off black". As I live in California, this could get hot in the summer. 2) There is a 1-2 inch lip where the rear hatch meets the vehicle. So, while the rear seats fold flat (after removing the head rests) you couldn't slide cargo all the way out of the back. You would need to lift your cargo over the lip where the hatch meets the car. As well engineered as this car appears to be, I'm suprised Toyota missed this.

EXTERIOR

The Scion xA is a wagon with the same general shape as the Matrix, with less tapering of the rear windows. I actually prefer the appearance of the Scion to that of the Matrix. The exterior is simple and clean, with none of the annoying plastic body cladding that is overused these days. The mirrors are body-colored, a nice touch in a car in this price range. I think the xA is distinctive but not in the same in-your-face way as the xB. I find it appealing, but I'm sure some folks won't like it.

PERFORMANCE

If you're looking for performance, you aren't looking at a Scion anyway. The engine is a 1.5 liter 4, with most of the power coming around 3000 RPM. This results in a bit of a slow start from a dead stop, but once it gets wound up, the automatic does a good job of keeping the RPM in the power zone. I was able to get up to speed to allow safe merging on the freeway. The auto also allows you to turn off the overdrive. If I lived somewhere where two lane highway passing was required, I wouldn't consider an Scion (or ECHO for that matter) The engine's limitations become evident in trying to go from 50 to 75 in a hurry. But in my life on the streets and multi-lane freeways in SoCal, this would provide adequate performance as a commuter vehicle. Gas mileage is projected as 32 city/38 highway. My experience this summer with an ECHO automatic rental was 38 MPG overall. As ths Scion is around 200lb heavier, I would expect a little less than that. 

If the engineers at Toyota could just figure out how to put the 1.8 130HP Corolla engine in the Scion, this would be a pretty peppy little wagon. Alas, no.

VALUE

The prefered option set for me would have been a completely base xA with the automatic transmission. That vehicle would be 13,765. So, for under 14K you get a vehicle with all the "practical" options. AND anti-lock brakes. Makes me wonder why ABS isn't standard on the Corolla...

THE BUYING EXPERIENCE

Scion dealerships are run along the Saturn-type model, where there is no barganing on price. What you see on the window sticker is what you get. But unlike Saturn, which has always seemed to pad their prices a bit, Scion seems a pretty good value to me.

If only Toyota would price all their vehicles this way...or at least the Corolla ;-)
