            I just bought a G1 at my local camera shop and I am very impressed.  My purpose for the camera is to take pictures of my family   and friends.  I hope to make calendars and greeting cards.  We are also shopping for a new home and thought it would work well for house hunting.   

I enjoyed Defbringer's review and  believe that it was written to benefit someone like me.  Honestly, it is a fine camera.  If anyone enjoys taking photos, editing them and finding creative ways to share them then this is the camera to get.

I have been wanting a digital camera for some time now because it looked like a lot of &quot;fun&quot;.  If fun is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about taking pictures then get a G1.  Otherwise get a real 35mm SLR.

If you are still undecided about a digital camera purchase be sure to visit this site.

Lastly let me just add that the photos I have taken so far with the G1 look better on my desktop than any of the 4x6 prints still sitting in my junk drawer.
