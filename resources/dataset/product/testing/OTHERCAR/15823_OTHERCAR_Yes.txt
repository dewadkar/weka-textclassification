            Just simply a smooth ride. I have been driving Toyota
all my life, this car by far has been the best one I have
ever driven, (85 camry, 96 Corolla were my previous
cars). So many things are right with the car I wouldn't know where
to start. Well First it probably has more driver side leg room
than any other Japanese import. I'm 6'4&quot; so that is a huge
factor. It is a very comfortable ride. I bought this car because
I trust Toyota a lot, and Toyota finally produced a car that is fun to
drive. In fact that is one of the few problems with the car, I like 
driving it too much,in the eight months I've had it I have put on
16k in miles. The only other bad part is that it doesn't have the greatest
tires. Toyota would serve the car better by providing it with better performance tires
it would help maintain the sporty look too. If you get the base model I urge
that you upgrade the stereo to the 3in1 CD/Tape/radio system with
six speaker system. One of the better factory systems I have ever heard.
The price range is about $19k-$24k, I leased mine which is the base model
and it came with plenty of features (power windows/locks, AC, Auto, Cruise)
and I upgraded the stereo as well, I pay $260 a month which isn't too
bad considering what you get.<br><br>
