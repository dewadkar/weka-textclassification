            In 1999, I was about to get a job outside of the range of the local subway system.  I needed a car... and quick.  Certainly with my minimal salary I could get a well-built japanese car, no?  I must say that 60,000 miles later, I am still smiling.

The beauty of the Civic; the reason there are 80 million of them, is because they are cheap, extraordinarily designed and built, and are basically no-maintenance.  I got the EX, with a manual; and it is fun to drive.  Not VW fun, nor BMW fun, but hey, it's 15,000 dollars.

The driver-side automatic window stopped working at 6,000 miles, (slipped the track -- was replaced under warranty) but other than that it's flawlessly performed.  The scary thing is, now I make enough money that I might splurge for something better; but the Civic never dissapoints.  It is, logically, the perfect car.  Fun, low maintenance, projects no particular image other than responsible transportation.

Sure, it's not flashy, and people dont peer at you when you drive by.  It simply sits in your driveway, happy to oblige for the jaunt down the street or the trip to another state.

Sure my coupe has no room for tall people in back, but who's buying a coupe for a family of four?  And it has power everything; and still looks like the day I bought it.  My only problem will be replacing it with something sportier, or with a better marquee -- because then I will be going against logic and getting a car for stupid reasons of emotion and image, replacing my perfect commuter car.
