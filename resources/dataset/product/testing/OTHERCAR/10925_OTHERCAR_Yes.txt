            Simply put, the BMW 323 Ci Convertible is a dream come to life.  Very little about the car merits any criticism whatsoever.  BMW, with its typical attention to detail, has created one of the best vehicles in its class.

The car responds to the driver's commands with near-telepathic accuracy.  A low center of gravity lets you maneuver almost effortlessly at nearly any reasonable speed.  The gauges and readouts are placed intuitively and read easily; for instance, the BMW's autobahn cruising speed of 80 mph (130 kph) is the exact point where the speedometer needle is perfectly vertical.

The car comes with two option packages:  the sport pack and the luxury pack.  The sport pack is the more useful of the two; you get better suspension, better wheels, and comfy sport seats.  The luxury pack is useful mainly for one thing -- the fully-automatic convertible mechanism. If anyone is riding in the back seat, it is a good idea to clear them out of the car before playing with the convertible top.

The BMW also has a lot of &quot;rules&quot; which can be easy to forget.  For instance, the convertible top must fully open before it can be closed, the remote trunk entry does not work if the emergency brake is not on, and the CD eject button does not always respond instantly if the car's computer makes a judgment that the driver is too busy driving (shifting gears, steering, using the brake or clutch) to fuss with changing a CD.  Because demand for the car is so high, I had mine imported directly from Germany. If you buy through a dealer in the US, the dealer will give you an &quot;orientation&quot; course to teach you all of the car's hidden tricks.

About the only negative comment to make is that the back seat is somewhat cramped in terms of leg room, but that is a hazard that cannot be avoided in any sport coupe.

It is a joy and a pleasure to drive and if you've never owned a car like this before you'll be tempted to drive it to no particular destination, preferably on some twisty mountain road, on a warm afternoon with the top down.<br><br>
