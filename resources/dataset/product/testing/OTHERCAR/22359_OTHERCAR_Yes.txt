  I think the salesman thought I was some sort of <b>diseased boob</b> when I pulled into the Lexus of Saskatoon dealership with my 1965 Dodge <b>Wart</b>.  The pickup had been a gift from my uncle who was an old <b>anally blasphemous brit</b> and I couldn�t wait to rid myself of the decrepit quivering heap.  That is, the truck, not my uncle.  You see, he left me a scad-load of greenbacks when he died, and I wanted to get the coolest car I could find.

  I made a bee-line toward the SC 430 and involuntarily salivated over the curvaceously masculine finish.  Starring through the glass I saw a reflection approaching me from behind.  It had to be a salesman

�Hey, I�m Earl.  What�s a <b>Dutch-Oven Christian blumpkin</b> like yourself going to do with such a nice car?  �and what the hell you going to do with that old wreck?  That thing looks about as inviting as a <b>rambunctious pirate-ravaged vagina</b>�.

  The nerve.  I mean, sure, my <b>bruised</b> old truck was about as fun driving as I imagined it would be as <b>munching</b> on a <b>discarded greasy</b> & <b>cheesy feces stank-burger</b> served on a <b>buttered crotch muffin</b> � and l really didn�t know exactly what I was planning on doing with such a nice ride � but who was this <b>diseased David Lee Roth-like douche stain</b> of a fellow to even ask me such an inflammatory question?  

  So I threw a cache of cash at his feet and told him he could pry it dry-and-sidewise up his smegma-chocked <b>sphinctorial</b> egress hatch.  We both stood in shock.  But then I realized that Sixty grand was an awful large wad to attempt something like that with, so I apologized for my rudeness and asked him out to lunch.  

 �Let�s first put the top down, eh?� Earl said with his new-found smile.

The motorized hard-top lifted <b>phallicly</b> skyward, then folded, and finally tucked itself neatly into the near full expanse of the trunk.  The better-than-Jaguar styling of the two-door still intact, I slid swiftly into the baby seal-like softness of the vehicles fully adjustable cockpit. 

�Lexus actually uses an <b>oil</b>-tanned <b>Bronco nutsac</b> suede.  It makes the texture <b>creamier</b> than a <b>cottage cheese-lubricated muff</b>, don�t it?� Earl commented on the interior as we exited the dealership.

All I could think to myself was �what a car�.  First off, with a big V8 engine and rear-wheel drive, it offers a very sporty driving experience.  Earl glanced over at me when I stopped at a red traffic light and motioned down toward one of the floor pedals and then toward the open tarmac ahead � I knew what to do.  

  The light turned green and when I <b>erotically pumped</b> down on the gas pedal, the 300HP engine exploded to life like the lancing of a pus-filled �ss <b>pimple</b>.  The run-flat tires <b>discharged</b> a <b>raw minty</b>-white smoke but they simply wouldn�t squeal � it was more like they <I>moaned</I> �  the 245/40ZR18 rubber is so <b>plump</b> they grip tighter than a teenage <b>shaft</b>-shiner (i.e. porpoise polisher).  The rear-end got a little <b>sloppy</b>, but I held the wheel tightly and pushed the pedal even harder as the speedo approached it�s 156 m.p.h. limit.

  Earl sat <b>anus-</b>clenchingly <b>mummified</b>, his <b>oral juice gland jiggily</b> gushing <b>oily lips liquid</b> back in streams across the sides of his cheeks.

And I laughed.
