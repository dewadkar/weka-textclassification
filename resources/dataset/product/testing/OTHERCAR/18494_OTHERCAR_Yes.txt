            The 2002 Volkswagen Passat covers an incredible price range, from the low $20,000's to almost $40,000.  This is amazing, since it's basically the same chasis throughout the model line, with differences mostly in engine power, trim items, and additional luxury features.  As a modestly priced, GL, manual transmission, cloth-seated family sedan, it makes much more sense than it does as the luxury  sedan it's being marketed as in W8 and GLX form.   Don't get me wrong. It's a nice machine. But dollar for dollar, I believe that there are better choices available out there.  I will concentrate my review on the lower end 4 cylinder  1.8T GLS model, since this is by far the most numerous model they sell, and the one that I think makes more sense to buy than the much more expensive models.   Here are my impressions.

EXTERIOR:  The Passat is a nice looking car.  The lines remind me of the much more expensive Audi A6, except the Passat is more balanced and flowing.  The finish is lusterous, and this car looks more expensive than it is.  I find the GLS to be under-shod in terms of wheel and tire size.  Passats that have been upgraded with 16" and 17" wheels and wider tires really look much better.  The 2001.5 models saw an exterior update that I think looks better, though some disagree.  

INTERIOR:  The Passat has a great interior.  Much superior to cars like the Nissan Altima, with its cheap, hard plastics, and rivaling true luxury cars like Audi and BMW.  To get the great looking wood trim, however, you will need to spend more money and get a GLS V6 or GLX model, I believe.   The gauges are attractive, with aluminum surrounds, but I found the gauges oddly distant and dark when driving around during the daytime.  The blue and red lighting at night is very cool, but it's unproven how effective that color scheme is in terms of visability.  

Seating was a big disappointment for me in the Passat.  First of all, you cannot get power seats on the GLS model.  In a world where even economy cars have this option, it seems like Volkswagen is attempting to force buyers up their line to get this important option.  I also found the seat cushions to be too short for my 6 foot frame.  They felt comfortable, but left my thighs unsupported, and I imagine this could cause fatigue on longer trips. I also felt like I was tottering on the seat, not sitting down in it.   The seats adjust in numerous ways, front/back/up/down, etc, but it's all done with cranks and levers, so it's not something that's easy to do on the move.  But for manual seats, they are very adjustable.  The Leather is nice, and makes the car look luxurious. The velour seats are cheaper, but definitely don't look or feel as nice.  

Overall interior size was a little disappointing, also.  It's big enough, sure, but I felt just a little bit more crowded than I expected based on reviews I'd read.  This truely is a smaller car than the similar Audi A6.  The center console was small and the cupholders, though an improvement over previous Passats, are just adequate.  

The "optional" (it comes on almost every car on the lot) Monsoon stereo system with cassette/cd was decent, but for an upgraded system it wasn't all that impressive.  Just decent.  But then I only listened to radio, not a CD.  So judge for yourself.   

As a $24,000 car, the interior is way above average.  But moving up in price, I'd want more out of it than it delivers in term of size and comfort, though it is attractive.  

POWERTRAIN: What a disappointment.  I usually drive V8 cars and trucks, so I knew the little 4 cylinder wouldn't give me the same off-idle oomph I was used to.  But in a short test drive, I was very disappointed in the large amount of turbo lag I experienced.  I mean, stomp the pedal and wait....the power is just not there.  And even when the turbo does spool up and deliver power, it's still nothing spectacular, just adequate.  The Tiptronic equipped auto is smooth, but does rob some of the power.  If you want to shift your own gears, the lower power level may be adequate, but don't expect an exciting driving experience with the 1.8T GLS.  Adequate for commuting, sure. But this is definitely not a sporty sedan.  Any of the comparably priced Japanese V6 equipped competitors will blow this car off the road in terms of straight-line acceleration.   And from what I've read of the V6 Passat models lacking low end grunt, it doesn't sound like they'll solve the problem for you either.  

HANDLING/PERFORMANCE/RIDE:  The Passat is a German car, so it handles competently.  But it is not a BMW or an Audi, so don't expect to feel like you're riding on rails, either.  There is moderate body roll, and the smallish tires need to be upgraded for better grip.  But the car feels stable at high speeds, has decent road feel with a smooth ride, and generally inspires confidence for regular driving.  It's not particularly fun to drive, however, compared to some of its other German competitors.  Braking was fine, with no grabbiness or lack of pedal feel.  Again, confident but not outstanding.  The Passat rides smooth and is reasonably quiet, thought not in the class of the more expensive true luxury cars.  

SAFETY:  This is where the Passat shines.  Front, side, and curtain airbags, a solid structure,   and great crash test scores make the Passat one of the safest cars around for its size.  Add in ABS (stability control will be available for 2003 as an option) and this is a great safety choice for a family sedan.  

OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE:  Another questionable area for the Passat.  Based on my internet research, Volkswagens have had more than their share of little problems that are driving owners crazy.  And worse, their dealers don't seem to have what it takes in terms of customer-first attitude to get the cars fixed and back on the road quickly.  I haven't been impressed with their dealers when I've visited to look at cars. They seem more suited to selling $17,000 Jettas than anything in the luxury class.  I just got bad vibes on both my visits.  As an example, nearly every Passat I looked at had some sort of damage or problem, from scratches to plastic trash still in the car after prepping to substances stuck  on the side of the car from god-knows-what.  They just didn't seem to see making the cars look sharp to be a big priority.  I had to personally rip the plastic cover off the seat of the car my salesman brought up for me to drive.  It is also a negative that even in my huge city, there isn't a Volkswagen dealer nearby.  If I have to make a 60 mile round trip for warranty work, I think I'd choose a more reliable brand.  

Which brings me to the warranty.   Volkswagen has made great strides here, upping it to 50,000 miles bumper-to-bumper and 60,000 miles powertrain.  This is impressive and tops its Honda/Toyota competition.  But, based on what I'm reading on internet bulletin boards, all is not so rosey.  The problem is, a warranty isn't much good if a company doesn't honor it, and sometimes people are reporting problems getting their broken cars fixed on the first, second, or even third attempt.    But if you live 5 minutes from a dealer, you may not mind so much.  

Resale value is said to be excellent, though that's relative.  Posted ALG Lease end values are more for newer used cars, not long term ownership.   I'm not sure there's as big a market for Passats with 120,000 miles on them as there is for a Honda or Toyota. 

SUMMARY:  Overall, I like the Passat.  I just don't want to put $32,000 into a new one that meets my needs just adequately.  When you add in leather seats, a (just so-so)  V6 engine, power seats, better looking and performing 17" alloy wheels and 225/45-17 performance tires, and suspension upgrades, you're just better off moving to another class of car, even if you have to spend a little more to get it.   I would prefer an Infiniti G35 or modestly equipped BMW 325 to a Passat, and the Acura TL type S is a good choice too.  But it all depends on what YOU want in a car.   I happen to want a little more driver seat space, power, and handling than the Passat offers.  You may just love the rich materials inside and the nice looks, need space for a family,  and not want to shell out $10,000 more for a BMW 525i or an Audi A6.
