            I first saw the <b>Mustek MDC-800 Digital Camera</b> on HSC (Home Shopping Club).  I was impressed with the &quot;ease-of-use&quot; the hostess displayed with the camera.  This camera is <b>NOT</b> a state-of-the-art camera, but one meant for that &quot;first purchase&quot; or a &quot;beginner&quot;.  I was definitely not attracted to the appearance of the camera, but I was impressed with all the functions and features as well as the software program that came along with the camera.

The major selling point of the MDC-800 is that it can be used as Digital Camera, a PC Camera, or a Video Camera and its large 1.8&quot; LCD display with easy-to-use and operate editing functions. The camera comes complete with 1 year warranty and free technical support, USB connectivity with extra-fine image quality and user-friendly &quot;Ulead's&quot; Photo Express 2.0 Image Editor on CD.

The MDC-800 has a resolution range from 506 x 384 pixels to 1012 x 768 pixels, which is acceptable, but not great resolution.  Pictures are automatically saved as JPEG file formats, you can also pictures as .GIF(s).

You can hook up the provided cable that attaches this Digital Camera to your TV or VCR and display and/or capture real-time video images while the TV is on...and everyone can see themselves on the TV or you can play back images that you stored on the camera itself...definitely a cool feature.

The Ulead software that comes with the camera is so easy-to-use, you can make Greeting Cards, Posters, Calendars, or show slide shows with your saved images.  Digital images are also instantly available for viewing, printing, emailing, using in presentations, web sites, etc.

You can purchase extra Memory Flash Cards on the internet, check out the Mustek website to find suitable dealers.  http://www.mustek.com

Overall, I thought this was a very good product for the money, but I'll probably hand this one down, and purchase a higher quality digital camera.<br><br>
