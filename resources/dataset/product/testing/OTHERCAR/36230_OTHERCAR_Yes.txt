            Strengths: 
Simply unkillable motor, rock-steady, with enough power to keep you interested. Basic yet practical interior, with decent feel and comfort. 

Weaknesses: 
Definitely uncomfortable seating for trips more than four hours. It is a compact car, so the space is limited, although there is surprisingly decent trunk space. Also, engine power decreases noticeably when the a/c is in use. Something to think about when changing lanes on the highway. . . . 

This is not a car for the family with more than three members, especially if the main passengers are 5'10" are taller. That is the only reason we are selling it; the family is growing, and I am 6'3"!! 

Compared To: 1985 Nissan Sentra - Mazda wins in comfort hands-down, but engine comparison? Nissan may have built and even more reliable engine! 

Review Summary: Very, very solid, reliable car. The essentials--motor, transmission, suspension, brakes--will never let you down. If you are about having reliable wheels to take you from point A to point B--no matter how many miles between the two--then this is your car. My wife and I logged 200,196 miles in nine years (highway miles--four years in MD, five years in NY), and the engine still purrs as if overhauled yesterday. We had the manual five-speed, again ultra-reliable. The car sips gas like you sip castor oil! Numerous trips up and down the atlantic coast, not one major complaint. Major replacements in last three years include water pump and radiator, but what do you expect when you get above 150,000 miles? Adjusting to Brooklyn streets took its toll on the front-end suspension, with two CV and ball-joint replacements, but that is our fault. And it is NOT expensive to maintain. Take of it, and this car will take care of you.
