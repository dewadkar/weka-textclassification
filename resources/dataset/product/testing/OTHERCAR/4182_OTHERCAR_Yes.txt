            We purchased a Dodge Grand Caravan in 1997.  It was the year-end clearance of the '96      .  We purchased it for about $21,000.  It had about 22,000 miles on it. The following are some of the reasons for purchase:

Heating:  Growing up, my family always had a van.  None of them ever had rear heat.  I remember wearing a blanket in the back seat to keep warm.  This was a plus for me.

2 side doors:  The one thing that I disliked about vans was having to pile out of one door.  The extra side door was an ingenious idea.  It helped out so much in getting little kids into car seats and out.  You didn't have to actually crawl into the van to unbuckle them.

Built in car seat:  This was wonderful.  I loved being able to not pack a car seat around from car to car.  The only thing I wish was that they would have had more than one in the vehicle.  Most people who own a van, have a few kids and extra ones would be helpful.  

Bucket seats in front:  This was so valuable on long trips, when one of the children needed attention.  We didn't have to stop the vehicle for me to get out and check the kids.  My husband could keep driving.

Tinted windows:  I really liked the tinted windows for keeping the kids cool.  I wish all cars had tinted windows for kids' sake.

Another thing that was a wonderful idea that Dodge put into their vans, was that I could run a different temperature of heat or air on the passenger side than what my husband was using on the drivers side.  My husband and I have completely different body temperatures.  This feature was invaluable.

Removeable Seats:  This was great for hauling big items.  We were remodeling our house and this feature came in handy a lot.  The seats were quite easy to remove and put back in.

Overall, the Dodge Grand Caravan is a great vehicle for families.  It also got really good gas mileage for being bigger.  We took a long trip in it and was surprised at how well it did.

We never had any trouble with it at all while we owned it.  We sold it only to get something to pull a big camper trailer.

I would recommend it.
