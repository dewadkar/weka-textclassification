            The HP PhotoSmart was my first embarking into the world of digital photography.  I've been meaning to try it for so long, but have been resisting because of the price.  With HP entering the market, I have found a camera with the features I'm looking for with ease of use and a price I could finally afford.

I was attracted to the styling of the 315.  Everything seemed in it's right place and everything just fit.  There weren't excessive buttons or menu options to just confuse me and the button that were available were laid out neatly with little icons and indentation to explain there function.  The camera has a nice heft to it and it fit in my hand nicely like a glove would.  The shape of the body is smooth and textured in the right places to ensure a steady grip at all times.  You intuitively know where to put your fingers and thumbs, hence no blocked out pictures.

I like the sliding door that protects the lens because I tend to lose len caps.  There's a nifty strap that comes with the camera.  The base of camera has a threaded area to mount a tri-pod on.  That's a nice professional feature.  

One of things I really like about the 315 is the jet-direct conectivity.  This is infared technology that lets you send files directly to an infared port on select HP printers and laptops.  It will work as long as the camera is line of sight and within one meter.  It's a good option if you want fast transfer of a single file.  IR is much faster than USB or memory card readers.   But the novelty of jet-direct wore off quickly.

There is a LCD screen on the top that lets you make some of your settings or preferences via two teeny buttons.  Press the left one and you can select three different resolutions.  Press the right and your get flash control and red-eye reduction.  Press 'em both at the same time and you set the timer.  These are all nice features you'd expect on camera for this price.

On the back of the camera you have you little 1.8" color LCD screen.  It's large enough to make out necessary detail.  I don't use it much though because it's the biggest sapper of battery power.  But, it's a thrill to show people unfamiliar with digital cameras  the end result of the picture taken just minutes before.

If you press the "menu" button while this screen is <b>on</b>you will open up a the menu giving you many more option for setting the camera.  You can erase file here, set the clock, language, digital zoom(2.5x), get thumbnails, lock your files, rotate, dpof, and magnify all with a four-way control.  

There a a some light indicator as well.  One, located near the memory door warns you not to take the memory out of it's holder just yet.  Another located near the viewfinder tells you when to shoot, the camera's ready.  

Taking the memory(8MB compact flash provided) out and replacing it back, causes no undue anxiety, because it's so simple.  There is a little blue retaining lever which will aid in releasing the memory from it's home.  You can't make a mistake because on the door inside the compartment is a diagram showing just how and in what order to do this.  It's fool-proof!  <b>Note:</b> Buy a larger capacity memory card so you can fit more of the high-resolution pictures on your camera.  I would recommend a least 32MB, but seeing as the price of compact flash is coming down, buy as large as you can afford.

The camera operates on four AA batteries.  I recommend buying the ones specifically for digital cameras.  In the long run, you will save money.  I believe the Energizer "titanium" ones are the best right now.  HP will provide you with four to start.  Buy some more because you'll use them fast to begin with.  <b>Hint:</b> Buy the optional HP power supply so you don't waste battery power when you download your pictures to the computer or printer.

<b>How do the prints look?</b> By and large the quality of the finished print depends on the printer just as much as the camera, but to ensure the most promise, I stayed with HP in every area.  I use HP printers, ink, paper and camera.  It's all made to work together and to keep the process simple.  Make sense?  I think so, but use your own judgement on that one.  

You may find you like another printer better.  Kodak paper is easily substitute for HP since they also manufacture HP's paper.  Ahhhhh, didn't know that did you?  Try Kodak Ultima paper for the best results or HP Premium "Plus."  Both are the best paper out there for HP printers.  I don't recommend other brand papers for HP printers because different printers use different inks and they adhere to the paper in entire different ways.  

Finally, with a HP printer, please, please only use HP ink.  Never refill those darling cartridges or buy cheap generic brand.  I almost cry when people do that.  HP spends billions of dollars in research and development on these ink.  They are developed to work harmonious with the the printers and paper.  Don't ruin you printer by purchase the cheap stuff.

Now, how do the pictures look?  I'm getting around to that. Previously, I used a PhotoSmart p1000 for printing, but quickly replaced it this year when HP finally introduced their line of six color printers.  I bought the 7350.  I love the results I obtained with the 1000, but found them to be a little on the grainy side.  With the 7350 and because of the addition of light magenta and cyan, the grain was reduced .My pictures look almost identical to the quality of a photolab.  I haven't tried an 8x10 yet, but I'm dying to see the results because I blamed the 315 before on what might have been the p1000's fault(lack of six colors.)  I will up this review when I test it.  HP recently improved there paper, so that also adds to the quality of the finished product.

<b>Update 11/27/02</b>

*Using the 8MB CompactFlash card that comes with the camera you will get 161 shots at low-resolution(480x640), 40 shots at medium and twenty at high.  

*The HP PhotoSmart 315 is a 2.1 mega-pixel camera.

*HP discontinued the 315 being replaced by the 320.  If 
  you can find a 315, you will save a lot of money over 
  the cost price of this  camera.  Also, try looking for it 
  bundled with the HP 825 inkjet printer.  The deal was 
  offered a few months ago and there may still be some     
  boxes available.

<b>Update 11/27/02</b>  I finally tested the HP PhotoSmart 315 on the 7350 printer.  I set the camera on the highest resolution setting and used <b> 4x6 Kodak Ultima Glossy Photo Paper</b> The results that I percieve are greater color depth, slightly sharper without as much of the graininess I had when using the  PhotoSmart P1000 photo printer.  I still notice some of the characteristic of the camera itself, probably caused by the lesser quality lens.  The result is still very good and rivals prints I've purchased from the photolab using  a regular 35mm camera.

My next test and probably a better test is the 8x10 print.  I'm waiting for a decent picture to take because ink is so expensive, but I will post my result when I have them.  I 'm hoping the results are equal to the 4x6 print I just "developed."  I will be impressed if the highest setting of the camera and the HP7350 printer will cover any flaws that might show up on the larger paper size.  Check back soon.  Solo.
