              I purchased my Miata at the end of last year after reading numerous reviews and testing many cars.  I am 25 years old and I was looking for a fun, sporty coupe that would fit my limited budget.  I also really wanted to own a convertible.  (Just for the record, my previous car was a Toyota Tercel 2-door...NOT fun and definitely NOT sporty!)  There are actually not very many fun cars out there at affordable prices.  I looked and test drove New Beetles, Ford Mustangs, Chrysler Sebrings, BMW Z3 Roadsters, Toyota MR2 Spiders, Toyota Solaras, Mitsubishi Eclipses, and Mercury Cougars.  I did also consider sedans from Volkswagen (Jetta) and Hyundai, just to keep my options open.  I did not want to spend more than $25,000.  I was actually at a Ford dealer test driving convertible Mustangs (and I had decided to buy a used car at this point to save money...) when the salesperson asked if I wanted to test drive the Miata they had there.  I figured it wouldn't kill me, although I really had my heart set on a Mustang and had basically written off the Miata as an option because it had only 2 seats.  To make a long story short, I was so impressed by the car that that Miata is now in my driveway...:-)
  The things I like about my car are:
      
  1.  The styling.  Very eye-catching and I get a lot of attention everywhere I go.  (Trust me.  This NEVER happened in my Tercel!)

  2.  The performance.  The 1.8 litre 4-cylinder engine is plenty powerful for this car.  I never feel like I'm in danger and cannot get out of the way.  I used to always feel slow in my Tercel...(to the point of feeling endangered.)

  3.  The equipment my car came with.  Limited-slip differential.  Cruise-control.  Bose CD and cassette sound system with 4 Bose speakers.  Tan leather seats.  Anti-lock brakes.  Dual airbags.  4-wheel disc brakes.  Cup holders.  Wind blocker.  Glass rear window with defroster.  Air Conditioning. Power windows, mirrors,door locks, antenna, steering and brakes.  14 inch alloy wheels.  Intermittant wipers (No car I have ever owned has had these). 
 
  4.  The gas mileage.  As long as you do not race too much, 26 miles to the gallon is possible.  Try that with an SUV!
  
  5.  The handling, of course!!  This car handles better than the Z3 and the Mustangs I test drove and there is really no way to explain it.  You must drive this car to understand it!!  But be careful,...one drive and you will be "hooked" on the Miata. 
  
  6.  The price.  I bought my car used for $13,500...about $15,000 out the door.  I highly recommend buying a 2 or three year old car to save on depreciation.  (Let someone else pay that!)  Also, because everyone wants an SUV or a truck right now, you can negotiate an excellent deal right now on these cars.  When I bought my car it had 24, 771 miles on it and was still covered under the manufacturer's warranty. (3 years or 50,000 miles for Mazda)  This car has a lot more personality and pizzaz than a new Hyundai or Beetle for roughly the same price.  Also, this car is a Consumer Reports "best buy" and seems to hold its resale value very well. 

  Along with these excellent qualities, there are a few shortcomings to the car which I must make a note of for those considering a purchase:

  1.  The rearview mirror hangs down to block part of the view out of the windshield.  This can be annoying during the day.  At night, SUV headlights shine right into your eyes.  (There is a day/night mirror switch and the dealer can "raise" the mirror up to open more of the windshield area.

  2.  The cabin is a bit tight.  Don't even think of buying this car if you are over 6 feet tall!!  The seats go back quite a ways, but if you commute a long distance or need a lot of width in a car, this may not be the right one for you.  (My commute is 30 minutes.  I am 5'10") And you definitely don't want to get blindsided by another driver in this car. 

  3.  The trunk will hold about 2 weekend bags or your groceries for two weeks and that is about it!!  If you need to put more than one set of golf clubs or two suitcases in the trunk, you won't be taking this car!!

  4.  The cabin is windy even with the windblocker, so short hair or a hat is a must!!

  5.  The only mechanical problem I had was a malfunctioning catalytic converter which was replaced free of charge under warranty by Mazda.  During the replacement, the mechanics messed up another part of the exhaust system, so I now have a completely new system (including new chrome exhaust tip) all for free under the warranty.  I even was given a free rental car during the repair, which lasted 2 days.  I am very impressed with the service I have received thus far from Mazda.  I was never treated like this when I had a Toyota.  (I've owned a Toyota truck and the Tercel.) 

  6.  No back seat.  This is a pain sometimes because I like to offer to drive friends around every now and then.  It is a good excuse not to take your car somewhere, however, and it definitley lets you off the hook of driving when you go in a group.  

  To sum everything up, I am very happy with my car.  I have had no additional problems after the catalytic converter (I've driven 6,000 additional miles since the repair).  I just change the oil, rotate the tires, and that is it.  I am very impressed by Mazda so far.  The dealership is wonderful and the product is great.  Another nice thing is the availability of aftermarket products and Miata owners clubs.  I actually love my car more now than the day I bought it.  Every day I drive my car, I am just more and more happy with it.  Compared to what's out there on the market, this car is definitely still a star, in both performance and cost of ownership!  I highly recommend this car to anyone with a tight budget that wants either a true sports car (more than just sporty styling), a convertible, or both!  You won't go wrong buying the Miata.  It really is that good!!
