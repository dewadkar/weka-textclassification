            At the beginning of the summer, our family traded in our old junky chevy truck, for a brand new silverado. Boy were we stunned.  The steering power, the soft seats, the great features (especially the sound system), and best of all, room for all the normally not thought about kids in the back.  I'm actually comfortable, for once, in the back of a truck!! It can fit about 7 people in it (to my experience) but its really made to only fit 6 (6 seat belts).  It's great for our Pennsylvania winters, the back can carry a ton of cargo, and features that tell my parents when my little sister has taken her seat belt off in the front seat.  It has an alarm, the lights automatically turn on when the brightness outside gets to a certain point, and after about 1 minute of having the truck running, the doors automatically lock.  I really can't find a disadvantage to this great truck!!<br><br>
