            I am not quite sold on the whole digital camera thing, but there is so much talk about it, I had to find just the right inexpensive model and give it a try.

Now keep in mind, I take about 2-3 rolls of film a week with a very nice SLR camera that does a lot.  And I wanted a digital camera about the same for a hundred bucks  {{{giggle}}} but this is close!!!

The price is right!!

The software is cool, and I am starting to get the hang of it!!!

Downloading pictures to the computer is kind of confusing, but I am still trying!!!

Pictures are very easy to make, I love the 1.8" color LED display monitor, it could be better, but beggars canï¿½t be choosers!!!

So far I think this is a great camera for the person who is inquisitive about digital cameras, but if you want a good camera, pay a little more and shop a little more!!
