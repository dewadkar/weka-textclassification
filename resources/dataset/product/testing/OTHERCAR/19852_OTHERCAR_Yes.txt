            This was my very first US made vehicle purchase.  I wanted to have a pick up, so I started searching information in web.   I did not think of Chevy so much before I started the search, actually my eyes were going toward Dodge Dakota or Ford Ranger.  S-10 is a little lower in cost than Ranger and a little smaller than Dakota.  I was not considering S-10 as my choice in the beginning.  After I did a lot of research on the web, I started actual window shopping.  It was more difficult than what the SPECIALISTS are saying on web to negotiate good price.  I visited Chevy dealer to just check on S-10 to see what it is like.  I liked front face better than Ranger when I actually saw it in front of me.  I sat on the driver's seat.  It is a bit bigger than Ranger.  Control panel seems to be in good location.  You know what?  I bought S-10 that day.  It has been 9 months since.  I have been very happy with my &quot;BUDDY&quot; for almost everything.  A couple of weeks ago, my S-10's ABS had saved my life.  Not once but three times in just 30 min.   I have driven many cars with ABS, but this one is working great.  I won't say the best but close to the best.  No engine trouble at all for all these times.  I am totally in love with this truck.  <br><br>
