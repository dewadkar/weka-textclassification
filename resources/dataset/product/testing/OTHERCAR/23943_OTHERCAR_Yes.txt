            The SLK 320 is already on sale here in Germany and you really should wait for this V6 engine. The 3.2 litre V6 turns the SLK (superleicht, kurz = very light, short) into a completely new car. I am not talking about performance and torque - the Kompressor offers adequate amounts of both - it's all about a very new feeling. The SLK 320 has great engine sound and great engine feeling. Forget about the 4-cylinder-droning - this V6 simply does a great job in the SLK and the handling doesn't get worse.
The new engine comes along with some cosmetic changes, new and much better seats, ESP as standard and new interior colours and materials.
