            Considering my 1990 Maxima was hit by the recent (June 2001) floods that hit southeast Texas, I had to find new wheels.  I drooled over the 2002 Infiniti I30, but found it hard to lay down that much green.  The 1998 I30t (the touring model), I found out, was a much better value.

<b>Near Luxury</b>
As it's classified by the car magazines, the I30t and its direct competitors (such as the Lexus ES300) are called <i>near</i>-luxury vehicles, where their bigger brothers (such as the Infiniti Q45 and Lexus LS430) are the true luxury sedans.  No matter--I'm not shelling out an additional $20,000 to get coddled just a little bit more.  I won't be inheriting millions from a rich uncle, so value is important, and this 1998 I30t packs some serious bang for the buck.

<b>Performance</b>
The I30t never has and never will be a slouch, since it uses the same powerplant as the Nissan Maxima: the much-spouted about 3.0-liter V6 that many consider the best V6 in the United States.  For 1998, this V6 makes 190 hp, which it makes effortlessly when you need to pass on the streets or highways--and it does it with little noise.

I admit I had some doubts about the "t" designation on a luxury vehicle: would the performance bent of this trim make the ride harsh, or just add meaningless weight onto the vehicle?  My doubts were unfounded, because the I30t is still a Maxima to its core.  Handling was excellent, as was cornering, helped out by 215/55-R16 alloys shod with Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires.  I am thinking of swapping these tires out for quieter Eagle GAs or the like, however, since road noise is a bit higher than what I'd hope for in a car like this.

<b>Luxury</b>
Forget the "near-" part of this car's classification; this car melts your stress away when you sit in it.  As with any leather-trimmed car (especially a used one), I suggest you purchase some leather treatment to keep the upholstery soft and supple, or it will harden and crack over time.

I believe the wood trim is actually simulated wood, but it's quite convincing nonetheless.  The wood surrounds the window switches and the parts of the dash, and warms up an otherwise somber interior.

The Touring model gets an all-black leather-wrapped steering wheel, which seems to prod you to perform at illegal levels on this car.  This trim level also gives you perforated leather seating surfaces and grips on the steering wheel, helping grip you just a little more than in the standard I30.  Nice subtle touches.

Luxury cars are about amenities, and the I30t delivers.  The auto-dimming rear view mirror helps greatly at night, and the keyless remote control and Homelink transmitter (which replaces three standard remotes, such as your garage door opener) make coming and going in your I30 a breeze.  Dual trip odometers, an express-down driver's side window, heated seats, business card/magnetic entry card holder (in the center console), and dual cupholders also help make the driving experience that much better.  My 1990 Maxima's level of comfort was a huge step up from my 1989 CRX, and this 1998 I30t's level of comfort is just as huge an advancement over my Maxima.

<b>Styling</b>
You don't shell out for a luxury car just to be comfy, but to own a car you (or passersby) can look at and be impressed with.  In my eyes, the I30 has always been the Maxima done right: since 1995, the Maxima's styling has always seemed half-baked, while the I30 would seem to be the final draft of a Maxima, where styling details and kinks were thoroughly worked out.

The grille has always been the best part of the I30's exterior styling, flanked handsomely by two headlights, which sit atop slim driving lights.  All are designed elegantly.  The tail, with its slightly Euro-themed wraparound styling, will admittedly look dated (if it hasn't already) with red running the complete width of the tail, but the taillights appear expensively designed and detailed.  This being the Touring model, you also get the spoiler over the trunk, tastefully done.

The car's profile is appealing, as is the view from the front or hind three-quarter's perspective.  As I mentioned about the styling, the I30's curves lessen the odd "big butt" styling of the 1995-1999 Maxima.

<b>Value</b>
I'm sorry, but $30,000 for a new I30 (and that's the starting price)?  That's rich, I'll say.  I have no problem with the quality or build of Infinitis, but just find spending that much scratch on a car difficult, since depreciation will quickly overtake it anyway.

Case in point: the 1998 I30t I bought for $17,995 in 2001 cost about $32,000 just three short years ago!  My I30t is still covered by the original manufacturer's warranty, and I bought an extended warranty on top of that.  So, I still get spoiled by Infiniti dealerships when I take the car in for routine servicing, and don't feel like such a sucker for buying the car new.  If I paid 32 large for a 2002 I30t and owned it three years later when it would be worth only 18 grand, you could turn my face into a heel like in the old Saturday morning cartoons!

<b>Conclusion</b>
The 1998 Infiniti I30t has changed my way of thinking about used and new cars for purchase.  I've always bought cars over 7 years old and 100,000 miles, but now see that buying a car 2-3 years old gives you low miles, peace of mind from a factory warranty (plus the option of extension!), and the feeling that hopefully too many people haven't performed nameless acts in the backseat.  And best of all, I don't feel ripped off.
