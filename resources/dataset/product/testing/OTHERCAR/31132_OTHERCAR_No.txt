            We had purchased one of the first 1997 Boxster's to arrive in Canada.... a wonderful looking and driving red one, black interior with the optional sports package, manual shift.

In our smaller community of 300,000 folks it was a hit everywhere we went, folks stopped in the street to see it drive by, folks honked their horns, the thumbs up... it was a joy to see folks that happy about a car.

The handling was superb, seats very comfortable even for a long drive, and I'm 6'3", 230 bs ... and she is vertically challenged at 5'2" ... and we both enjoyed driving the car.

The interior was rather on the plain side, and absolutely no cup holders for coffee or drinks... the goofy little plastic things that sort of could hook into the sides of the dash were just plain silly. But driving was an absolute joy. And we have owned alot of sports cars ranging from Triumphs to Alfas.

The negative was the lemon that this poor car was mechanically. The list of what was replaced was almost everything: engine (yes a new engine), roof, brakes, electrical roof closures, paint peeling, rusting wheel lugs, electric windows refusing to go up.... or suddenly going down, speed control malfunctioning, etc etc etc. 

Now to be fair Porsche was superb about taking care of all the problems, always supplying free service cars, if you call a basic VW a service car, valeting it 80 miles each way to the nearest Porsche dealer, all at no charge to us.

But after two years of this nonsense we finally suggested that Porsche might want to buy this lemon back (with about 20,000 miles on it)... they reluctantly did. 

Do we miss the car, yes very much, would we buy another one, yes and no. Yes if we had not already owned one, but not a 1997, or probably a 1998 for that matter. The novelty of the Boxster has sort of worn off, we just purchased a  2001 BMW 328ci cabriolet (will review in 6 months time)  for Dorothy to drive ( at least this can take all 3 grandkids), which will do us until the new small Jaguar sports car debuts in 2004 or so.

If you are considering a 1997 please hold off, too many new car problems that could prove to be very costly if not under warranty. Instead look at a later model Boxster, perhaps with the slightly larger engine (save the money and don't bother with the S-Boxster unless you live in Montana and can drive as fast as you like)

For us it is still preferable to the BMW, Honda, Audi or Toyota sports cars. Please free to e-mail if you have any further questions and thank you for taking the time to read this.
