            The Saturn SC is the first car I bought new and I never regretted it.  The car gets excellent gas mileage.  On long road trips, I have pulled over and took a power nap in the comfortable seats.  I have put very little time and money into the up keep of the car nd it still runs great and with the class the dealership gives you when you but the car, you can do a lot of your own upkeep, even if you are not that skilled in car maintance.

My Saturn sc has also survived a few crashes, one of which was pretty serious, yet little damage was done to my car due to the bumpers.  The one bad thing about the car is it can get expensive to fix and the dealership in my area is slow to make the repairs.  <br><br>
