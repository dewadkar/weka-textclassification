            I grew up with a 1975 Camaro. It was a off white exterior and tan interior. This was my dad's baby along with a 1968 Malibu Chevelle. These two gorgeous cars was what i had grown up with. I learned to appreciate a good old American Car. When I graduated I received my own to call my baby. A 1995 Camaro.
Cherry red with black leather interior. Beautiful!
Electric windows, electric locks and electric seats, cd player, A/C, and heater.
It is a convertible so the only bad thing is those really hot summer days. With top up during the summer the inside of the car is a cooker. With the top down the black leather is a frying pan. 
It's only a 3.4 liter but it still gets up and goes when i need her to.
I don't mind the summer stuff too much because guys don't mind seeing a girl sweating in a tank top with the top down and hair every where.

From point A to point B and looking good.<br><br>
