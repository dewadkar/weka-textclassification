            We currently own two Subaru Legacy Sedans, a 1995 and a 1999.  The '95 has 115,000 miles on it and the '99 has a little over 30,000.  Our first Subaru was a '93 Legacy Sedan, It went about 40,000 trouble free miles before we traded it in on the 95, to upgrade from front to all wheel drive.  

These cars are reliable!  None of the three we've owned have required service that wasn't called for on the service schedule.  That's over 185,000 total miles, 115,000 on one vehicle alone, without a problem.  For those who maintain their own cars, service items are easily accessed.  The oil filter, oil drain plug and oil filler pipe are all easily reached from the front without raising the car.

The cars perform well.  They�re not sports cars or street racers but they have power and handling that will allow snappy turns and stops as well as cruising at 80 miles per hour without stress or strain.  The all wheel drive and anti lock brakes inspire confidence in slippery conditions, confidence that is well placed.  If proper care is taken, the car handles rain, snow, ice, sand and wet leaves with aplomb.  Ground clearance is not as high as in an SUV, but then again you can make tight, quick turns that would put an SUV on its roof.  Fuel mileage is good but not great, around 26-30 mpg on the highway.

The interior is reasonably comfortable for 4 people.  There are 5 seat belts, but the center rear position is for very short hops only.  The four cylinder engine shakes a bit when it is idling.  The vibration goes away as the engine speed increases and is not a problem at cruising RPM.  The trunk is large with a flat floor and low liftover height.  The split fold down rear seat backs are a nice feature.  

Subarus used to be pretty homely vehicles.  The first ones to arrive in the US were downright ugly.  Styling has improved considerably.  Today�s Legacy may not make heads turn in admiration, but the look is now reasonably handsome.  However it is not appearance, but the combination of all wheel drive, reasonable cost, and outstanding reliability that keeps me buying these cars.
