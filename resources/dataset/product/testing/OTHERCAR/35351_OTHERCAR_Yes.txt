            I picked up my baby to get back a passion for driving that I had almost lost with the seemingly endless commutes to and from work. The car almost anticipates your next request and stands ready and willing to make you a satisfied sports car owner. Yes, I said sports car. The Miata's got sport in droves, but, alas, therein lies one of its disadvantages(if your a person of average means like myself). If you are planning to use this car as your everyday mount, be prepared for high levels of road noise, occasionally harsh feedback through the steering wheel from real world road surface conditions. And please don't expect economy car gas mileage. The Miata is sprightly even though it only touts 140 H.P. It achieves this through its high rear end gearing (for instance my 5-speed revs 3800 RPM at a leisurely 65 MPH in top gear) Unfortunately, I only see an average of about 24 MPG in this car. But, its definitely worth the sacrifice as any passion purchase is to the passionate soul who can appreciate the Miata's rewarding character and ability to invigorate you.
