            Now that I've racked up some time behind the wheel of the van, it's time for its first evaluation. Considering how tough it is to not love your first brand new vehicle, I will try to be as objective as I can. Yes, I intend to nitpick a little.

The eC models of the Caravan and Voyager were what we used to call "strippers," bare-bones transportation. For a sticker price of $17,290, you got a peppy 2.4 liter engine, air conditioning, sliding doors on both sides, and a decent-sounding AM/FM cassette stereo with 4 speakers. Mine was heavily discounted ($13,295 on the tag, $14,750 out the door) because it was a leftover model - judging by the build date of 10/2001, it may have sat for as long as a year before I got it December 31, 2002. Although the eC models were not continued into 2003, you can get pretty much the same thing as the Voyager Family Value Package. For some reason, the 2003 equivalent has an MSRP of $20,895 - maybe it has a somewhat nicer interior, but I'll be darned if I can understand how they can charge $3600 more this year for basically the same van. I expect the Voyager to be killed off when the next generation of minvans arrives.

The first thing I noticed was that the engine is somewhat loud - it seems louder than even the 2.5 in my old Caravan, which had over 200,000 miles. When you accelerate, you can hear it over the radio unless it's cranked up. Don't get me wrong, it's not an unpleasant sound, but most reviewers would downgrade it for this. However, I think they'd be impressed with how this smallish engine can move a fairly heavy minivan. With 150 hp, this thing moves out almost as well as my old 3.3 Dynasty did, and returns an average of 25 mpg. I've even unintentionally squealed the tires in it!

Fit and finish on the outside is excellent, but I've gotta say, the interior has a few minor flaws (again, I'm trying to write this like a magazine reviewer). The kick panel underneath each front door is made of cheap, soft plastic and seems loose. The speaker grilles in the back are made of this same material, and not only do they have too much "give," but one of them vibrates on some bass notes (just noticed that tonight). Also, the very top of the carpeting up front can be pushed back at least 2 inches. I don't know if that's normal, but it shouldn't be. Yeah, this is the economy version, but still...

The instrument panel is virtually a clone of the Dodge Intrepid, with white face gauges and a large, slightly tilted 120-mph speedometer (it goes the normal 240 degrees, but "0" is at the 9:00 position). In keeping with the economy theme, the only gauges are for temp and fuel. The digital odometer comes on when you open any door, which I believe is pretty much the standard now. The radio stays on until you open any door, which is also becoming a universal feature. I intend to upgrade the stereo in the near future, and another Allpar poster has assured me that an aftermarket stereo will also work this way.

Entry & exit is, believe it or not, a little tough for me. I'm 6'1" and 270 lbs. (yeah, I know), and the doors are cut too low. I have to stick my head inside first, then climb in. Once inside, there's a ton of headroom. Although I have no power seats, couldn't they make the seats adjustable up & down somehow, or better yet, cut the doors higher into the roof? Also, the window cranks are rather low and a little too far to the rear. Sure, not too many people buy vans equipped this way, but how about a little love for those who do?

Unlike many reviewers, I don't give a tinker's damn about the quantity of cupholders, but suffice to say that the ones that pull out from the dash are adjustable and capable of holding just about anything short of a 2-liter bottle. I also like the two power points, one switched with the key and the other to the battery. The rear seat has handy hangers in the back for plastic grocery bags, and if you've ever come home from the supermarket to find half your stuff scattered in the back, you'll appreciate this feature.

On the road, this van feels substantial, and I mean that in a good way. The steering wheel has a nice, thick, soft rim, and even budget buyers get to look at the pretty winged Chrysler logo in front of them. You sit up nice and high with a lot of glass around you (I'm not looking forward to having to clean the inside of the windshield!). The power steering gives just the right amount of assist (unlike my old-school 1988 Fifth Avenue, which is way overassisted), and the steering is very responsive. I was amazed at the maneuverability of this van compared to the '93 Caravan it replaced. One of the roads I frequently use runs between the Dodge Truck plant (Warren, MI) and a GM Hydramatic plant (if you're in my area, it's 9 Mile Road at Mound), and trains often stop (and back up!) at the railroad crossing, blocking traffic for several minutes. This happened tonight (January 18, 2003), and I made a U-turn from the left lane of a typical five-lane road without coming anywhere near the curb, which would not have happened in either the old '93 Caravan or the Fifth. It has performed admirably on the two snowy days we've had here (Detroit) since January 1 - I've made an 80-mile round trip on a snowy, slippery freeway without my knuckles turning white.  Also, the only noises I hear inside are the engine and the stereo. No rattles, no whistles - this baby's tight.

Overall, the van gets an A-. Sure, there are a few minor flaws, but it does everything I need it to do, and gives you all the good things about a minivan at the price of a Neon. It's a shame the eC model is no longer available, but even at just a hair under $21K, the 2003 equivalent is a good value, and I'll just bet you could find a good discount on one. If you're in the market for an SUV, forget about the so-called stigma associated with minivans and give one of these a try. You just might find it's all you need.

UPDATE:  I worte this review for another site in January 2003, and cut/pasted it to this one.  On May 8, 2003, the van had 8300 miles and has exhibited no defects or problems.  It hasn't once gone back to the dealer.  If you think you'd be better off spending thousands more for the supposed better quality of an Odyssey or Sienna, you're making a huge mistake.  You can probably get a great deal on a new Chrysler Voyager, since it isn't advertised and few people know it exists.  You certainly can get it for less than an equivalent Dodge Caravan.  Chrysler made a mistake dropping the Plymouth nameplate - Plymouth was all about value, and the Voyager has that in spades.
