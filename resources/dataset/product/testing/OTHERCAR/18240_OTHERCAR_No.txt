            I own a 94 Volvo 850 without turbo.  I purchased the car from an Infinity Dealership over two years ago.  I have mixed feelings about the car so I will start with the good and then warn you of the bad.  I will be fair to Volvo in that this is only the second year of production for this line.  My overall feeling is that if I knew the car itself would hold together around the engine I wouldn't sell it.  There is just too much small things that add up.  It leaves me thinking, "What's going to tear up this month?"

First the good:
1.  The car looks great.
2.  Great transmission (shifts smooth)
3.  No engine problems whatsoever
4.  Trunk and sunroof doesn't leak!
5.  When I am at a stop light, the twenty other people around me don't own the same type car.

Now the bad: (problems I've had)
1.  Low gas milage (avg 19mpg in city)
2.  Rubber trim mildewed so I had to repaint
3.  Plastic trim lines that run from the front windshield,  across the top of the roof, and to the back window CRACKS and causes a buzzing sound at high speeds.
4.  Fuel leak around the top of the gas tank.
5.  Major electrical problem.  Melted directional switch and flashing unit. (around a $400.00 repair)
6.  Constant rattling coming from the rear passenger tire area.  
7.  Front dash creaks and cracks.
8.  Altough I clean and treat the leather, cracks form on the outside section of the driver and passenger seats.
9.  The windshield cleaner jets don't work.
10.  The odometer went out.  (Dealer replaced at no charge)

Maybe that sounds ok for a car with only 60,000 miles but I haven't had that many problems out of my '90 Honda Accord with almost 200,000 mi.
