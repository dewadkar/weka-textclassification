            I already have a point and shoot camera that I'm quite happy with - a Yashica T-4.  But I have lots of friends who are wired, and sharing photos with them is tough.  Scanners are slow and produce terrible output, and PhotoCD/PictureCD is prohibitively expensive.So I marched down to to Black's and decided to pick up a camera that could produce reasonably nice pictures, without indulging in rocket science or trying to displace my T-4.  CCDs are still a long way off from displacing film for photography, particularly anything you intend to blow up pictures for display.The MX-1200 that I bought came in this complicated, nasty, big, loud hard plastic container.  Taking it out was exciting.The user interface is very easy to use, with everything shown on the little LCD screen, and a handy four-way pad to navigate.  It has white-balance and contrast settings that I don't use, but the first thing you're offered is flash control, which I fiddle with all the time.   Friends are delighted to see photos seconds after I take them.  And if the photo's ugly?  Push the down arrow, and it's gone.There are two significant flaws in the design of the camera, one annoying, and one which might make you reconsider a purchase.  First, the part of the camera with the lens on it protrudes from the case. It almost screams out &quot;scratch me&quot; or, at least, &quot;smudge me&quot;.  That's the annoying one.The fatal flaw is that the flash is very close to the lens.   When taking a flash picture indoors, more often than not there will be a bit of dust floating in the air.  The positioning of the flash virtually guarantees that this bit of dust will reflect brightly into the lens, and you'll get a big circular splotch on your photo, as if there was a water droplet on the lens.Additionally, you will have to drop about $150 on accessories to make this camera truly useful.  The first purchase should be a bigger RAM card.  If you want to take nice, high-res pictures, and more than just a few, pick up a 32mb card.    You'll be able to take enough pictures to sap a set of batteries, and still have room to spare.  $100 Canadian.The next purchase is a camera case - you need one to protect the lens, and the delicate silver paint on the body.  You can't just toss the camera in a backpack.  A thin, $10 replacement pouch for a point and shoot will do.The next purchase is a USB or floppy adapter so you can dump the pictures quickly.  The serial interface is stupendously slow - 800 bytes per second, according to the application I use ('camera' for the BeOS).   It takes half an hour to empty out the 4 meg card that comes with the camera.  The USB adapter will empty my 32mb card in less than a minute. $60 Canadian.The camera uses a fairly standard communications protocol, and will work with the BeOS or Linux in addition to the standard MacOS and Windows TWAIN drivers.<br><br>
