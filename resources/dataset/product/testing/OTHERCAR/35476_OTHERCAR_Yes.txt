            With excellent clarity and focus, you'll be taking perfect shot out of the box. The included infolithium battery lasts over two hours for me easy, even using the LCD - which most cameras have trouble with... The 707 has a different body design compared to most models, but I'm finding it easy to use, and the swivelling lens is great for taking comfortable pictures and maximizing stability. The 5 megapixel image quality is amazing. Auto features are great and handy most shooting conditions great, and for the more photographically inclined, there are plenty of manual settings to satisfy. A great camera for those wanting to slowly  get into manual photography. With the 707, you're not even limited by darkness. Nightframing helps you focus in a complete darkness, and then take a normal picture using flash (limited by flash range). Nightshot uses the IR emitters to light the area, and you can take an IR picture in complete darkness as well. Very neat! The biggest downfall is the Sony MemoryStick media required for photo storage. It's expensive compared to other types, and only a 16MB stick is included - enough for 7 high quality, full-sized pictures. But on the upside, you have a very fast camera - power on is amazingly fast. Focusing is fairly quick, although for action shots, you'll want to half press the shutter button to focus before the shot you want to take. And the zoom is great - 5X optical and 2X digital! All around, a wonderful camera to use!
