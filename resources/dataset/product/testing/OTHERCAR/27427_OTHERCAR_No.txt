            This car is my first car.  My dad bought it because he needed something cheap to drive since he was going over his lease miles on a much nicer car, and he figured I could drive this after he turned in his leased car.  The first thing to go wrong with the car was the A/C... the selector from outdoor air to recirculated air stuck in the middle and wouldn't blow ANY air in the middle of the summer.  Then the drivers seat got stuck in a position too far back for me.  The factory paint on this car is not very good, it has a habit of fading in some spots.  This car has EXTREMELY squeaky brakes but that supposedly cannot be helped.  Also braking is unpredictable and you never know how well they are working on any given day.  This car bottoms out on ANY speed bump and I'd hate to see the underside of it.  Also the suspension leaves much to be desired.  
I have a 2 door highline model, and there are no doorframes on the windows, and they aren't nearly as thick as other 2-door windows I've seen.  The windows rattle when rolled down and stick out from the seal when the door is closed.  The cargo area is great for a car it's size and the fold down seats are nice, but the trunk shelf is very high and can be difficult seeing out the back.  The car is able of getting good gas mileage but only under perfect conditions and the car seems to never be in a perfect condition.  The final straw with this car for me is that after 64,xxx miles it needs a new head gasket and a new rear main seal.  That's around $1100.  These cars have notoriously faulty head gaskets and I've seen a friend's Neon go through 3.  the good news is is that Chrysler will chip in on the head gasket replacement if you appeal to them enough.  In short, this is NOT a good car to buy.  Only buy this car if you are looking to torture yourself.

Update 11/28/00---
67,xxx miles and still rolling.  My local garage said they could replace the head gasket for about 400, HALF as much as Chrysler said they could do it for.  Funny, since the Chrysler dealership said they could do it for $800  minimum.. sounds to me like the Chryselr dealship would be taking $400 in free money.  Shady deal all around.  However, the guy at the garage said that this engine was one of the best that Dodge ever made- except the head gasket thing.  He said that with excellent upkeep he's seen them go on for 150,xxx miles, and I could beleive him, but this head gasket thing is still rather pesky.  I wonder how long it's actually been leaking since I've had a mystery oil leak for ages.  So it's still driving, but not without it's squeaks and annoyances.  The engine might be great, but not worth the many small pains it's given me!<br><br>
