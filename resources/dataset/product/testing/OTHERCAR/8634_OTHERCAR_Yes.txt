            It's nice to have a new vehicle that is unique on the road.  You won't see too many Optimas because it is part of  a fairly new product line.  Unlike its staid competition a la Toyota Camry or Nissan Altima, the Optima has distinguished lines.  Not overly rounded, like most common new cars, the Optima is conservative in appearance, even with nice touches of chrome.

The Kia nameplate seems to have its abundance of critics.  I've yet to meet one who actually owns one of these cars.  The 2001 Optima is my second Kia.  I purchased my first Kia back in 1997 (a Sephia model) which can be reviewed from my other epinions.  As of this writing, the car now has 110,000 miles on it and is still asking for more.  Maintenance remains at tires, brakes and regular lube changes.  WOW!  Critics, say what you will, the car is paid off and is still promising more loyal service.  As an aside, little things like the CD player and AC still work just as good as the day I took delivery back in 1997.

As you can see, my decision to purchase the Kia Optima was based on my hands on experience with one of Kia's  other products.  I wanted a bigger and better car than the compact Sephia.  The Optima was the ideal choice.  The car does not at all feel like a bigger Sephia.  It is in another class altogether.  The ride is smooth.  My wife calls it glide.  The car was purchased to put enormous miles on it in a relatively short period.  Therefore, highway comfort was placed at a maximum.  In addition, this car has not only dual front side air bags, but side impact airbags as well, not to mention side impact protection spars.  Interior noise is also super quiet.  CD/AM-FM/Cassette is standard on this car as is Cruise control.  Power everything is the norm in this car.  I did not opt for the sunroof or leather interior as it jumps the price astoundingly.

Our vehicle has the Inline 4 cylinder, not the V6.  It is important to note that the engines are almost identical in cubic inch displacement.  The result is that while the takeoff performance of the V6 is probably better, cruising speeds are no problem for the workmanlike big Inline 4.  I've heard that Kia is looking to put a big 200 bhp engine in future Optima's to compete with the sport sedan market.  That may be a nice marketing tool but my wife and I are not leadfoots.

This car also came with Hankook tires.  Like others, I had never heard of this tire.  To be sure, I plan on replacing them around 40k miles.  I like to have good tires on my vehicles (such as Michelin or Goodyear).  However, my own reluctance at having the Hankooks is based on ignorance.  I have no idea whether it is a good tire or a bad tire.  I will post a separate review of the tires after they are replaced.  So far, so good.

I'm not really a techno head when it comes to cars so let me talk about the things I really like about this car.  First,  I think it is a beautiful car.  It most reminds me of the new Cadillac big sedans.  Yes, I know it's not in that class at all, but it looks like one, with its chrome grill and big eyes (large Halogen lamps).  It damn sure feels like a big car when you are in it.  The steering wheel is tight and feels good in the hands.  The guages are all easily visible, and the automatic shifter is within easy reach.  I wanted the standard shift, but my wife insisted on the automatic.  I'm glad she won that argument.  Standard shifters are best suited for sporter or small roadsters.  It would be totally  inappropriate for this, dare I say it, luxury car.  Well, there, I said it.  The Optima feels like a luxury car.  I grew up riding in Cadillacs, Audis, and Mercedes.  The truth is technology has improved so much over the past 20 years that $18,000 can get you what used to be prohibitively expensive.

My last advice is this.  Go test drive an Optima.  You might just fall in love.
