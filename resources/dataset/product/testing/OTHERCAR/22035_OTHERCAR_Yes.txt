            Sound like a joke? With this car you can haul people, groceries, whatever and have fun, If you like to drive. 
Please drive a Taurus or Lumina first. Then drive this last. You will buy it. Feel the corners, Step on that gas pedal, slam the brakes.
I would recommend this car, even over a Camry or Accord, the industry leaders. 
The smooth-as-silk v-6, has been rated over &amp; over by industry magazines as the most sophisticated and smoothest v-6 on the planet.
Dual overhead cams, Platimun sparkplugs, Direct-port injection &amp; a all-aluminum engine.  220 H.P. out of 3.0 Liters, Hang on!
When you corner in this car, You'll forget it has 4-doors. And the 4-wheel disc brakes, stop...now!
I love my electric leather seats and the stereo.....whoa.
The stereo is a custom tuned BOSE. Each speaker has a built in amplifier and equalizer. 200 Watts of the cleanest sound, 1st car stereo that could hurt my hears.
Reliable, Roomy, Fun to drive, with a high re-sale value.
Compared to this car, FORD &amp; CHEVY should stick to trucks!<br><br>
