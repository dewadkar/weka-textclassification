            This is my first "grownup" digital camera and after doing my homework(the internet has made me a compulsive consumer researcher) my initial choice was a Fujipix 1400, based both on personal recommendations and samples of its output.  Unfortunately, however, it was discontinued a few months ago and I was unable to find one "left on a shelf" anywhere.  

I had originally hoped to spend around $200, but as I began to shop for an alternative choice, I realised that my requirements exceeded my budget and no other model in the price range was going to do what I wanted:  I've done a fair bit of 35mm photography, and, while I don't expect a digital camera to REPLACE film for me, the quality does need to be at least acceptable.  Most of the sub-$300 cameras were relying only on digital zoom -- I wanted optical -- limited focal lengths for their lenses (some so-called zooms were only offering 30-50mm 35mm equivalents, which is barely worth the effort), I wanted a little bit of manual control, and, most importantly, I wanted IMAGE QUALITY. 

The 2600 turned up at my local Staples for $299.  Now, although this was over my budget, this model INCLUDES both batteries and charger AND comes with a 16MB smart media card (the other models I was looking at came with at most 8MB), so it really compares to buying a $250 model without the extra goodies thrown in. 

First impressions are very good indeed.  It has reasonably intuitive controls -- I got it up and running without even looking at the manual -- and the image quality is nothing short of breathtaking.  The accompanying software installed faultlessly, and I was uploading test shots via the included USB cable in less than 10 minutes after I got the camera home.  Pictures upload in seconds, and Fuji's FinePix viewing software is stable and easy-to-use -- absolutely the embodiment of "transparent" technology.

The case is very compact -- chunky from front to back, but very small right-to-left, kind of like a rather deep Instamatic.  This is great for portability, but those with large hands may initially find it a little awkward, although you quickly get used to it.  The viewfinder is on the far left -- for me, I prefer one more centrally located, but that may just be because I'm used to my SLR having it there.  It's certainly not a "problem", just not my preference.  However, the far-left placement of the lens is actually a useful feature for right-handed users -- it's VERY difficult to put your finger over the lens no matter how you're holding the camera!

The only thing which is a little less-than-obvious is the sliding lens cover:  it actually has TWO open positions, and if you don't click it home all the way to the right, the camera doesn't register the lens as open. The lens cover completely encloses the lens, though (which retracts/protrudes when you switch the camera off/on), which is reassuring to those of us of the clumsy persuasion.  Hard to tell how robust the housing will be -- it's plastic rather than metal, but it feels pretty solid. 

The clear LCD display menus are easy to figure out (as mentioned above, I didn't even need to consult the manual to find my way around the main choices) and you scroll/select with the buttons on the upper rh corner of the back, which also control the zoom.  The zoom button itself is intuitively placed and easy to operate with the camera in "shooting" position. The brightness of the LCD is adustable, although I found the default setting excellent indoors, and perfectly acceptable outside in overcast light.  When you "playback" your pictures on the LCD, you can zoom and pan so you can check expressions and image clarity on-the-spot; the display also allows you to view individual pictures or thumbnails of all that are there. 

Bottom line is, of course, image quality. My test shots, taken using "normal" image quality, are nothing short of stunning.  It's all automatic TTL exposure -- you can manually control white balance and add exposure compensation, but other than that, it's the camera's sensors which make the decisions.  Based on the test shots, it's a good decision-maker -- in particular, a tricky macro shot came out spectacularly well, based on the camera's exposure and flash choices. Color is rich and true with good saturation; like Fuji's 35mm films, it favors blue/greens.  Very impressive.  

The macro mode is worth a mention on its own account:  I've NEVER used an automatic exposure AF camera (film or otherwise) that produced such good macro shots.  If one of your reasons for a digital camera is to shoot insurance pictures, this one's the one.  Stunning exposure, focus and flash.  I did some flowers and some jewellery, with pro-quality results.  Just incredible.


The 3x optical 2x digital zoom (digital only at low res) offers a nice range of focal lengths (30-118 35mm equivalent); images were crisp and clean at all resolutions, and downright stunning at the full 2mp setting.    It's essentially point and shoot (with a few manual bells and whistles), but it does a very good job.

While waiting for the included rechargeable batteries to fire up, I used some (cheap low-end) alkalines.  I only got about 10 shots out of those, but I did have the display on the whole time and they weren't great batteries.  The chargeables seem to have much better life; Fuji claims 300 shots per charge, but we will see...  Batteries and Smart Media slot are both housed under the same sliding door no the bottom of the camera, and are easily accessible.

The MPEG feature works as easily as the still shots; I haven't yet tried it as a PC camera, but given the ease so far, I'm confident it won't be a problem. 

This is pretty close to a perfect entry-level camera for somebody looking for excellent image quality, compact size and ease of use which allows a little bit of manual control.   If I were to design my "perfect" camera, it would also offer a program AE mode, slightly less lag time between shots,  the ability to take a filter (I'm paranoid about lens breakage!) and a separate button for controlling the flash options (accessing the menus is simple enough, but it would be nice to have a "hot" button for the flash choices, which include automatic, fill flash, flash off, slow synchro & red-eye reduction), but these are "wishlist" features -- and I'm sure that their inclusion would instantly turn it into a $600 camera.  For this quality at this price you have to compromise somewhere and it would be churlish to complain, particularly when the autoexposure is so good, the housing is designed to protect the lens, and the menus/displays are so thoughtfully arranged.

It's a stunning piece of equipment at an attractive price.  If you want one under your Christmas tree, I'd start shopping now, because I'm sure it's going to be VERY popular!!!
