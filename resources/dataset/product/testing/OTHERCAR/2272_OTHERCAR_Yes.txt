            I've had my Amigo for 1 1/2 years now and it's been running like a champ. Very dependable vehicle thats never let me down. Since i've had it, i've only needed to take it in for it's oil change and a change for its serpentine belt. 
My dislikes of the vehicle is that it's unstable to drive in excessive speeds and that it simply does not come with cruise control for my model. 
Other than that, i've been very happy with it. 
Don't let its outside fool you, it comfortabley sits all my passangers with plenty of leg room. 
I've installed a Rockford Fosgate deck, 2 12" Rockford Fosgate Punch series sub woofers in a single box (that fits perfectly in my cargo area), 500 watt Rockford Fosgate Punch series amplifier (that also fits appropriatley under my seat), and with original stock speakers...let me tell you...it's good to be me. 
It's sleek, sporty, compact design makes it a for sure eye candy far from all other SUV's in it's size, and even other vehicles that are not.
This vehicle is vertually for anyones liking, except maybe for expectant mothers, being that i can see why it might be little difficult to hop in the back to strap in junior.
