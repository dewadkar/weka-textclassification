            I brought a 96 chevy caliver and it was junk. I had one year and it was always in the shop. I trade in before the year was over. I got a ford. Everything went wrong. Very costly it was thing that werent cover on the warranty. It wasnt roomy. Notmany colors to chose from. It raffles too much  It didnt handle the road good bad on snow and bumps. Not many options. I drove the 1999 caliver and it drive bad too....This is a car that willnt last and u spend more in the long run. i woulnt recommend this car to no one. I say buy a ford or a dodge. it took alot to gas to run it too <br><br>
