            I bought my 1990 Galant GS in May of 1990 from Dobbs Brothers Mitsubishi in Memphis, TN. The car was virtually identical to the model that had won the 1989 Motor Trend Import Car of the Year award. The 4-door sedan I purchased was equipped with a 2.0-Liter, 16-valve, DOHC engine that produced 130 hp. The transmission was a 5-speed manual. Features included driver-adjustable suspension, AM/FM stereo cassette, A/C, and &quot;sport seats&quot;. The car was marketed as a sports sedan, and was highly touted by the automotive press. I very nearly bought a Taurus or Camry, but I really wanted a more sporty car with a 5-speed stick.

When my Galant was relatively new, and before the constant problems started, this vehicle was a joy to drive. It looked good, felt good, and made me feel smart for having purchased it. The ride was fairly quiet, and the engine accelerated smoothly almost to the 7000 rpm redline.

The first problems didn't bother me at all. For instance, in the first year a vacuum hose problem caused the fancy suspension system to fail, but this was easily repaired. I always strictly followed the maintenance schedule specified by the owner's manual. Dobbs Mitsubishi performed all routine maintenance with the exception of oil changes, which were done quarterly at various 15-minute oil change shops.

I thought it was unusual when the battery went dead, in my second year of ownership. The inside dome light had been on all night (because one of the doors did not shut completely). This caused the battery to go completely dead. It turns out that Mitsubishi had installed extremely cheap batteries as standard equipment. No, they were not covered by the vehicle warranty (3 years-50,000 miles). I bought myself a big, heavy 5-year battery at Autozone that was about twice the size of the original battery.

My first major problem occurred at about 53,000 miles, in 1993. The car went completely dead one Saturday morning when I was about a mile from home. On Monday the Dobbs repair shop called to tell me that my timing belt had broken, and it had caused severe damage to the engine. They estimated repairs to be in the $2000-3000 range. (Incidentally, the owner's manual specified that timing belts on the Galant did not require  replacement until 60,000 miles.) However, they offered to rebuild the valves/cylinders as a warranty job, for free, if I would let them keep the car for 10-14 days, and use the repair job as a teaching tool. Naturally, I quickly and gratefully accepted that offer. I continued my strict observance of the published maintenance schedule.

The next major problem happened at 97,000 miles when the second timing belt broke. This second belt had lasted only 44,000 miles. The Dobbs repair shop informed me that I would need a new engine, which they would provide for $5,000. They would only consider putting in a brand-new engine. By this time the car, even if repaired to perfection, was not worth $5,000. I argued that the damage should have been covered by warranty because the timing belt was still 16,000 miles shy of being due for replacement. Neither Dobbs nor Mitsubishi corporate felt bound by the guidelines published in the vehicle maintenance schedule.

I strongly suspected that Dobbs was trying to pressure me into trading for a new car. I refused. Seeing no point in ever again using Dobbs' or Mitsubishi's services, I had the car towed to Metric Motors, an independent repair shop. After several days of looking, they located a used 2.0-Liter DOHC Mitsubishi engine, which they installed for me for about $2200 total. The car was running, but it would never quite be the same again. The last few years of ownership were a constant battle with oil leaks, unstable engine idle settings, smoking exhaust, fear of broken timing belts (which we changed every 18 months or 30,000 miles), on-board computer failure, and electrical failures that included a battery explosion. 

I kept the Galant for 9 years and 140,000+ miles, an indication of my  stubbornness, rather than quality or reliability of the vehicle. In case you had a doubt, I will never buy from another Dobbs-owned dealership again. Neither will I purchase another Mitsubishi automobile again. I'll steer clear of their TV's, VCR's, and other gear, too.

Note: Most Galants sold in 1990 were the LS variety with a SOHC engine. PI suspect the LS models had much better reliability than the GS. Mitsubishi sold a lot of early-1990s Eclipses that had the same DOHC engine as my Galant. I have observed that very, very few were still on the road just a few years later.
