            I was looking for an AWD vehicle that wasn't an SUV. The market is small. Mitsubishi's few AWD sedans, Subaru (own one, hate ride, cheap construction), and Honda's CRV/Toyota RAV4 (small SUVs, car platforms) were the choices. 

Audi is a unique combination of a sporty feel and luxury appointments.  The car with the Quattro (AWD) option holds the road, corners superbly, and is well-powered.  I have the 2.8 engine (190 HP).  The interior is
comfortable, well-designed.  The factory stereo is good, the Bose upgrade is excellent sound.  The seats have enough adjustment options to keep most people happy.  It looks beautiful from the outside, with nice compact lines.

Driving is a pleasure.  It gets me out of the way when I need acceleration.  The ride is true to the road, an excellent combination of
the &quot;feel&quot; of driving, without the bumps and pothole feeling that one can get with smaller cars (i.e. BMW Z3).  It is not a luxury couch the way
Lexus feels.  If you are looking for a seamless road ride, look in the Cadillac/Lexus/A8 categories. While it gets about 20-24 mpg in my driving habits, city driving is closer to 18-20 mpg and gas costs are higher than my prior Honda Accord. 

The warrantee is 3 yrs/50K miles, all inclusive.  I may cringe when that is over, but so far, the German precision and engineering that made this car possible at $33,000 (with Quattro, leather and Bose) will make it worthwhile.
