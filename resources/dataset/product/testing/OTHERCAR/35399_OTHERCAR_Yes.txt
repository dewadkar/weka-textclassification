            This is actually my 6th Nissan pickup truck to date (I started out with Nissan's Hardbody truck some 15 years ago).  All of my trucks have been 2 wheel drive (2WD) and 4-cylinder engines from Nissan to date.

The 2001 (same for 2002 and 2003) Nissan Frontier remains a great truck.  The ride is very good and controls, switches and ease of use/driving remain just plain simple and efficient.  CD players became standard in 2001 (goodbye cassette) with AM-FM stereo radios.  In 2001 the truck came with standard air conditioning.  Nissan upgraded the wheels to alloys even on the most basic truck model and overall, while a small truck, its appearance is very pleasing as trucks go.

Reliability is the main reason I keep buying Nissan products.  Service is near non-existant other than oil changes.  They just run and run and run without incident.  In all my six trucks, never have I ever had a roadside problem and that says a great deal by itself.  You can trust the vehicle.

It has its flaws though.  Expect fuel economy equal to a SUV.  I get about 12-14 city and just a few extra miles highway.  Very poor engine performance in terms of strength is instantly evident.  I often must downshift to 1st gear to get up even a simple hill and I 'RPM' the engine to levels I don't like or feel comfortable with.

What also has always concerned me about the truck is that at speeds in excess of 65 MPH, it has a handling feel that becomes insecure or questionable.  It's rare you'll exceed 65 MPH, but if you do drive fast or reside in an area where speed limits are greater than 65 MPH, this truck isn't as sure of itself beyond 65 MPH.

There are many positives to this truck and I still highly endorse it and will probably buy several more in my lifetime because Nissan builds an excellent product when you consider everything from price to reliability to style or comfort and finally ride quality.
