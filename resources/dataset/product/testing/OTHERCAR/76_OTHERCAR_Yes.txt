            The Dodge Ram Maxi Van does what it's supposed to do: Haul loads of people from point A to point B.  Having driven this car in the heat of Los Angeles traffic, I've noticed that there were several pro's and con's, and I will explore both.

The Pro's.  The van is downright comfortable, with enough legroom and headroom for passengers.  It's huge, seating up to 18 comfortably and up to 22 somewhat uncomfortably.  The seats are plush and the air conditioning hits the right spots.  Big side-view mirrors are a must in a huge van and this van possesses them.  The center console is accessible, but could be re-worked, since the radio controls are way too close to the shifter.  Performance-wise, for a van, the Maxi Van accelerates decently.  The acceleration is loud, however.  No funny sounds, which is a plus.  However, no other positive comments can be said.

The Con's.  This van is bouncy.  Suspension is not a high point in this van.  Hit a bump or a pothole, and everyone flies.  (Trust me)  The steering is stiff and for all the 3 point turns you have to take, and you will...it is a hinderance.  The shifter shifts into different modes without deactivating the brake, which is a safety issue.  This van is huge and that in itself is a problem under certain driving conditions.
