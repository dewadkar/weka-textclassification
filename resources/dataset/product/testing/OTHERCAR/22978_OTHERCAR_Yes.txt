            This past Christmas my husband purchased this camera for me as a gift.  I had never used a digital camera before, so I was a little scared at first.  This camera is very easy to use, it comes with a CD for your computer and it is a very simple program to use. The camera also features an adapter so you can save on batteries. It also features a self timer, so you can actually be in a picture with your family. I took pictures that very morning and was downloading them all and printing them by early afternoon.  

The pictures come out very well on your computer and look great when you send them to family and friends.  When you print them you can tell that they are from a digital camera, but the program itself has many features that allow you to lighten the picture and reduce red eye.  Another feature with the program is that you can add lettering to your pictures, I found that really neat.

Overall I found this camera to be great for a first time user and the price was pretty good, considering the prices that you see them go for.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a new user the digital camera world.<br><br>
