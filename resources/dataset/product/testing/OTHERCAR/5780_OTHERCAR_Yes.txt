            I love this camera. I finally got tired of wasting money on film and pictures that didn't turn out. It took about 1 month of research to find this camera. 

It takes excellent photos. I've received great comments from family and friends on the pictures. The on-screen menu is very quick and easy to use. The NiMH batteries it came with are still in it after about 40 to 50 pictures, downloads and 3 months later. Rechargeable NiMH batteries are very inexpensive to replace these with. A lot of people have commented on the slow downloading. I haven't had any problems with that at all. I think it's relatively quick and the software it comes with is great, easy to use and you can get 4 snapshots to a page.

The only think I would suggest is to buy an extra memory card unless you want to constantly have to view the photos you just took and delete the ones you didn't like. On a special day it's not convenient. Another thing you would want to consider when purchasing any digital camera is a high quality photo printer. Between the two this makes all the difference in the world.

This is even a great camera for electronic dummies. I figured it out very quickly and all you have to do is glance through the manual.

I highly recommend this camera.
