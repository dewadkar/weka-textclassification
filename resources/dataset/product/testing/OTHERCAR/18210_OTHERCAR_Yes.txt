Back in 1998, I had a day off and decided to go car shopping. I always love to go out and look at what I can not afford. I decided to try out the local Acura dealership. I had always heard great reviews on there product and wanted to see what they were really like. Half an hour later they had me out test driving a 1998 Acura GSR. They had me hooked. It was quick on the pickup, nimble on the corners, and felt solid as a rock.
After deciding that was the car for me I went into the part of the car buying that I just hate. What options do you want? The salesman told me with the GSR the only real options are wheel locks and floor mats. You could have leather or cloth interior and no price difference. I took the leather.
So, what do I love about this car? Everything. From the way it rides,good and solid, to the way it handles, like a dream. For being the low end of the Acura line, it still feels like I am in a luxury car. The seats adjust in about any position you want, and also have the lumbar support you need for the long drive. The manual shift on this car is very precise and effortless. 
This car is for everyone who wants a sporty ride, but does not have the means to buy the true sports car. Sure, it doesn't have the speed of the Z-28 Camaro, or a Corvette. But, 150,000 miles down the road the Acura will still be going strong and not nickle and diming you to death. My Camaro sure did. My Camaro did have one other thing my Acura doesn't. Rattles. I would strongly suggest anyone in search of a new car, the Acura is not the prettiest on the street, but go give it a test drive.
