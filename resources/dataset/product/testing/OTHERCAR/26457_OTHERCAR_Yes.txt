<TEXT>
            In late July of 1993, I was almost 8 months pregnant, big as a house, and stressed over the impending arrival of our little bundle of joy.  At the time, I was driving a 1986 Ford Mustang, a car which fit the image of the new college graduate that purchased it, but not the image of the new parent that I was about to become.  I hated that car, as much for its lack of reliability as for the fact that it often doubled as a hockey puck in the middle of winter.  For a number of weeks, I had been watching the automotive section of the newspaper and looking at the advertisements for &quot;responsible family cars&quot;.  So it was that I saw the ad for the end of year clearance sale for Jeep Cherokees.  My poor husband didn't stand a chance.  Before he knew it, we were sitting at a Jeep dealership and signing the papers for our first &quot;family car&quot;.

Our 1993 Jeep Cherokee, which is lovingly referred to as &quot;Cheap Jeep&quot; (or CJ for short), was as close to the base model as could be found (which explains why it was so cheap).  The Jeep came with a 5 speed manual transmission, on the fly 4-wheel drive, and a 3-litre engine. The only extras on this Jeep were air conditioning (a necessity for a woman as pregnant as I was) and metallic paint (a color called &quot;cordovan&quot; or burgundy, if you're not making up color names).  

<b>Interior</b>

The interior of the Jeep is functional even if it isn't completely comfortable.  When I'm sitting in the driver's seat, I often feel like I'm much taller than my actual height (a little under 5' 5&quot;).  With many other cars, my arms are cramped when I adjust the seat such that my short legs can reach the gas pedal.  That's not the case here.  The back seats are less comfortable.  There's adequate legroom for short people if a short person is driving, but it gets pretty cramped for taller people or when my 6-foot tall husband is driving.  The seats are also shorter in the back, which means that passengers can't rest their heads back.  

The best feature of the interior, though, is the room in the back.  This has become essential for us, especially on our Christmas trips to Ohio.  I have also loaded a variety of other things in the Jeep as well.  The strangest was a stuffed 4-foot tall dinosaur that I had made for my godson.  The heaviest was a large number of bags of mulch and topsoil (so heavy that it caused the back end of the Jeep to sink 3 inches).  

<b>Exterior</b>

When I was first starting to consider buying a Jeep Cherokee, I spent lots of time pouring over Consumer Reports to see how it rated the Jeep.  Oddly enough, the only negative that they had was that the styling was the same as it had been for the previous 10 years.  It's true that the look is somewhat boxy, and I have had at least one person say, &quot;What?  It's a 93 model?  I thought it was older than that.&quot;  However, I like the traditional look and the lack of swoops and curves.  It looks rugged and unpretentious.  While the Jeep is large inside, it really isn't that large outside.  I was surprised to find that, while it's taller, it is actually smaller in length and width than our 4-door Honda Accord sedan.

After 7 years, I still like the looks of my Jeep Cherokee.  I am happy to say that, other than a ding in the door (due to being ding-ed in an underground parking garage).  Unlike other cars that we have owned, the Jeep hasn't rusted at all, and when it's clean, it still looks as sparkly as the day we bought it.

The one thing that I don't like about my Jeep Cherokee is that it lacks a rear windshield wiper.  The back window gets dirty and/or clouded during bad weather and hampers visibility.  I had expected that the water would just run off the back window, but it doesn't.  

<b>Maintenance</b>

For the most part, I have been really pleased with the reliability of my Jeep Cherokee.  It has only had one major problem in 7 years and almost 100,000 miles.  Almost 3 years ago, I had driven to Chicago from Ohio. The Jeep was driving smoothly while I was on the highway, but when I stopped at an off-ramp, the Jeep died.  After several attempts, I finally got it started again.  This sort of thing happened repeatedly over the next week or so.  (My trip to and from Chicago was NOT fun!)    However, it only happened when it was very cold.  Finally, it got to the point where I couldn't get the car to run at all.  The Jeep had to be towed to a mechanic, where the problem was diagnosed.  The manual transmission hydraulics had failed, and $800 later, the Jeep was up and running again.

We have also had a variety of really silly problems that I have not seen or heard of on any other car.  First, the gearshift knob has broken off three times.  The knob has a plastic piece, which is connected to the gearshift with a screw.  The plastic is not durable enough to handle the rigors of the constant shifting and breaks under the stress.   The gearshift knob costs about $10 and the labor to replace it is another $15.  The first knob was replaced under warranty.  The dealer did not charge us labor for the second.  But we paid the full price to replace the third.  Next, the plastic molding on the side of the car has fallen off.  According to the Jeep dealership, the molding is connected to the car via double-sided tape.  As the temperature changes, the glue on tape loses its ability to adhere.   It seems to me that Jeep could come up with something better, but they haven't.  In light of the fact that it will likely just fall off again, I haven't bothered replacing this.  Then, a few weeks ago, while I was parking the Jeep, the button on the emergency brake popped out, along with the spring that was underneath it.  The mechanic said that he had seen this before, though he does not know what causes it.  Unfortunately, at the time the button popped out, the emergency brake was halfway engaged and could not be disengaged.  I tentatively drove the car long enough to get it to the mechanic where he disconnected the brake until the part could be ordered.  The cost of this repair was around $140.  Finally, last week when I got into the car and started to back up, I found that my interior rearview mirror was missing.  Apparently, it had been connected with the same type of double-sided tape used to connect the molding on the outside of the car.  The mechanic replaced the mirror (since the car had to go in for the emergency brake repair anyway) for about $25.  

Still, I have been pleased with the reliability of the car.  With regular maintenance, it still drives as well as it has in the past.  

<b>The best aspect of my Jeep</b>

The very best part of owning my Jeep is that it lets me drive like a man!  The four-wheel drive makes it so that I can drive anywhere under virtually any conditions.  Road construction?  No problem!  Drive out over the berm and keep on going.  Snow?  Get real!  Again, the four-wheel saves me.   I shift into four-wheel drive when I need it, and shift out of it when I don't.   My Jeep Cherokee maneuvers well, allowing me to zip in and out of traffic.  I have never been concerned about it turning over, like other SUVs have been known to do.   And if I want that last up-close parking space, I don't have to worry, because the size of my Jeep is enough to intimidate people in smaller cars.  The people in Slug Bugs know that I could drive right over them if I want!  Best of all, I am up high enough that other drivers can see me yelling at them when they are driving stupidly.  My stature may be diminutive, but I feel like the king of the road.

I love my Jeep Cherokee and will probably drive it until it drops in its tracks.  The way it has held up so far, that will likely be a long time, unless of course, some critical item is attached with double-sided tape!

This review is part of the Gender Bender Write-Off, which came as a result of someone who said that &quot;women can't write reviews on auto, computer, electronics, and other typically male things&quot;.  Hopefully, I have proved the nay sayer wrong.  For other proof, consult the reviews of these other ladies:  <i>amykhar</i>, <i>bluehawq</i>,  <i>conradd</i>, <i>crazym3</i>, <i>KaraHoo</i>, <i>KateTPZ</i>, <i>KristenNC</i>, <i>MsBayLady</i>, <i>netKat</i>, <i>prepoia</i>, <i>soxfan</i>, <i>taurusmoon</i>, <i>thinkerlady</i>, <i>VeeZee</i>,  <i>wivabef</i> and <i>zoey123</i>.  Of course, this led to the question of whether men could write &quot;girlie&quot; reviews.  So these gentleman have offered their talents to prove that they can:  <i>ChrisJarmick</i>, <i>janesbit</i>, <i>njymix</i>, <i>slick4591</i>, <i>tipu</i>, <i>T.Rob</i>, and  <i>white_hat</i>.
