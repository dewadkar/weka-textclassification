            �That�ll be thirty-five dollars and seventy-five cents.�  I heard the weathered old lady at the counter say as I diverted my attention away from the circus flyer.  We had stopped in some one horse town just outside of <i> Black Mailbox </i> New Mexico for gas and beer.

�Thirty five dollars?�  I asked in amazement.

�Thirty dollars for gas and five dollars for the beer.� The lady said after taking a short drag from her cigarette and flicking the cherry into an ashtray that had obviously been stolen from some cheap Vegas hotel.  She had a bright red bouffant hairdo and a black T-shirt with a picture of an alien on it.

Emptying my wallet and waiting for my change I noticed the circus flyer again.  The date had been October the thirty-first.  It was Holloween; the day after my marriage.  I had been driving for a day, I hadn�t shaved, and for some reason this circus flyer was captivating to me.  I gazed at the flyer wondering how a desert town that seemed to be comprised only of a gas station and a hotel could support such a thing.

Bearing a company name that I didn�t recognize the flyer touted trapeze artist, elephants, jugglers, and clowns.  The flyer advertised that the circus had begun on the twentieth and had ended on the thirtieth.  My wife and I had missed it.  We had missed this circus by just one day.  It sounded like an amazing event.

As the nice lady at the other end of the counter was counting my change I asked her about the circus.  �How was the circus?�  I asked.

�Oh it was great.�  She said in a sardonic tone, regarding me with the cigarette hanging from her obscenely wide lips.  �They had a clown car with at least twenty clowns in it.�

�Twenty clowns?�  I asked in amazement as I took what was left of my cash after filling up the massive tank of the Chevy 2000 Blazer.

We had rented the Blazer for our honeymoon drive across Western America.  There was a quarter of gas in the tank at the point at which we stopped in <i> Black Mailbox</i> New Mexico yet I knew we had to fill it up.  The Chevy 2000 Blazer burns a tank of gas about every seventy miles and in the harsh desert environment that we were driving across to complete our weeklong journey to the West Coast I felt that there was no need to take chances.  I dutifully filled the tank at every gas station.

�Yep� twenty clowns coming out of a Voltzwagon Bug.�  She replied.  �Isn�t that something?�

I agreed.

Turning the key in the ignition and driving away from the gas station I inserted a CD into the sound system and told my wife about the circus.

�Twenty clowns!?!�  My wife said in amazement after I had told her about the clown car.  �That seems impossible!�

I regarded her with serious conviction as the Blazer�s amazing sound system blared in the background.  She was an expert on clowns.  Her stepfather was a Shriner clown.  If anyone could pass judgement on clowns and their abilities it was my wife.  �Don�t you think that�s possible� I mean� Is it impossible to get twenty clowns into a Bug?�  I asked.

My wife then said something that I couldn�t hear.  The Blazer we rented sported an amazing sony sound system with six-inch woofers and a beautiful pair of tweeters.  As PJ Harvey reached the bridge to the song <i> It�s a Perfect Day Elise</i> my wife�s words were drowned out.

�What?�  I asked.

Suddenly before the halogen beams of our rented Blazer the desert road erupted into a mayhem of fuzzy wool balls and rubber noses.  Turning the wheel I took advantage of the Blazer�s 100.5 wheelbase and deftly veered around the first colorful shape in the road.  Suddenly there was another which I barely missed swinging the wheel to the left.

�What the hell are you doing?�  My wife screamed as I spun the wheel madly to the right avoiding yet another brilliantly colored shape in the road.

�Something�s happened.�  I said as I slammed on the brakes bringing the rented SUV to a perfect stop.

Stepping from the car I noticed the body of a clown resting on the road.  Half of his colorfully painted face had been ripped off from the force of being dragged across the coarse asphalt.  Blood spurted from his rubber nose as I ran to him.

�Are you okay?�  I ask, kneeling and grabbing his hand.

�I� I�� He stammered.

�What happened?�  I asked closely checking his eyes for dilation,

He replied in a daze.  �Tootles had been drinking.  He was mad at Bonzo because he had found a picture of his wife naked� without her make up in Bonzo�s bag of wacky tricks�..�  He began to trail off.  �He� he��

�Go on.�  I prompted.

�Tootles began arguing with Bonzo.�  The clown replied.  �Bonzo threw a pie at him and Tootles lost control of the car.  We ran off the road and crashed into something.�

Urgently I asked.  �How many of you are there?�

�Twenty.�  The clown replied.

I suddenly stood turning to my wife.  She had gotten out of the car and was standing in the red glow of the taillights.  She was shaking her head and looking at the cell phone.  �I can�t get a signal.�  She said.  �One of us will have to drive back to the town and ask them to send the paramedics.�

Walking to her I took hold of her shoulders.  �No!�  I said,  �There are twenty clowns out here that need our help.  If one of us tries to drive back to some clowns will die.�

<b>Daturawest</b> regarded me in confusion.  �There�s nothing else we can do.�  She said with crushing finality.

I frantically looked from my wife to the Chevy Blazer and then back to the clown gasping desperately for air through his broken rubber nose and his cracked and bloodied cherry red smile.  �How many of you are alive out there?�  I screamed to the still night�s darkness surrounding us.

My voice echoed in the distance sending chills up my spine.  <i>Were they all dead</i> I wondered.  <i>Had this one clown with his life fading away before me now been the only survivor?</i>  I listened intently to the world around me, my breath caught in my throat.  There was only the sound of crickets chirping in the darkness to comfort me.

�It�s only him.�  I heard my wife say, her voice solemn and depressed.  I regarded her, my mouth agape as I tried to comprehend the twenty clown bodies surrounding me in the cold desert night She had tears steaming down her face.  �Just this one beautiful clown�� She trailed off.

I looked at the clown and then back to my weeping wife. .  Seeing him laying there in the middle of the road dying along with the image of my wife unable to control the flood of tears that had engulfed her I knew there was no other decision that I could make.  �This clowns not going to die.�  I said in a low determined voice.

I rushed to the clown�s body, lifting him by his armpits and dragging him towards the SUV.  My wife dutifully threw open the single cargo door in the rear and folded down the rear passenger seat in a frantic daze.  �You�re going to make it buddy.�  I muttered to the clown as we neared the car.

�I need my horn.�  He gasped.

I stopped, regarding him incredulously. �Your horn?�  I asked.

The clown nodded and wearily ran a hand through his curly blue hair.  �It was my father�s horn.�  He explained.  �He passed it onto me when he was killed.  He died when I was just ten years old, crushed to death by Jumbo the circus elephant.�  Grabbing me by my shirt collar with strength I didn�t know the clown possessed he added.  �You have to find my horn!�

Looking up I squinted my eyes and gazed down to empty road.  Off in the far distance there was a faint glint of light reflecting off something metallic.  <i> Could that be his horn?</i>  I wondered.

I left the clown near the rear bumper of the Chevy Blazer and ran to the object.  Jogging up to it I realized that this was no ordinary horn.  The chrome had flaked off in places and the bulbous rubber honker was dried and cracked with age.  Despite the wear and tear of age you could see that in it�s day this had been one of the funniest horns every carried by a clown.  Huge and obnoxiously silly I couldn�t blame the clown for wanting to take this horn with him.  I retrieved it respectively from the asphalt and jogged back to the blown.

�Is this your horn?�  I asked.

He nodded his perpetual grin tight and forced with pain.

I handed it to him.

�One last honk for my brothers.�  He said squeezing the bulb.

The horn echoed across the desert.  It was a hollow sound, a sad and pathetic sound.  I thought that it would be the last sound I ever heard on that desert road in New Mexico.  I was wrong.

Suddenly the night was filled with the sound of wacky honking and bells,  Clowns began to emerge from every direction of the night.  Some were dressed in silly doctor�s uniforms carrying other clowns on gurney and bumping into one another,  Others came limping and staggering on there own will.  They all had smiles plastered upon their white faces.  They all seemed happy to see us.

After a brief count I determined that all twenty clowns had survived the crash.  I somehow felt strange that I wasn�t laughing.  Even as one clown squirted me in the face with a giant daisy pinned to his ridiculously large lapel I still remained sober.  I had never before seen so many broken rubber noses and bloodied silly ears before in my life.  The scene was one that can best be described as a tragic miracle.

Thanks to the Chevy Blazer�s 1305lbs hauling capacity we were able to get them all in.

I wish we could say that they all lived but I can�t.  Some clowns died that fateful night.  Thanks to the Chevy Blazer�s poor fuel consumption we ran out of gas on our return trip to the town.  Getting a mere 16 miles to the gallon the Blazer simply could not haul twenty clowns the distance back into town.

To the fallen clowns� I am sorry.

<i>The part of the clowns tonight was played by Chevy Blazer owners.
The part of the horn was played by the blazer.
The part of the old lady was played by the Blazers fuel consumption.</i>

There ya go fellers� alliteration is a dangerous tool.
