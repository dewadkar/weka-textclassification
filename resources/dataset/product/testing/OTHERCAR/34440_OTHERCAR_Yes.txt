            I had high hopes for a Saturn. I leased this SL2 recently after my lease on my Chevy Prizm ran out (see that review!). I had test driven a Saturn at the time I chose my Prizm and actually only chose the Chevy because of the price (slightly better lease deal). But for three years, though I LOVED my Prizm, I wished I had a Saturn. 
So I got an SL1 because the lease deal they were running was exceptional ($199 down, $199/mo 39 months). It ended up costing me a bit more because I opted for many options (Power package, CD player, etc.), but it still was quite reasonably priced for a reliable American-made car.
So far, I am pleased with it. My only problems - there are no headrests (on SL and SL1 models -- another reason to go for the SL2!), storage is somewhat limited, but by no means bad, and on the highway, road noise can be fairly loud inside.
Overall, it's a fine little car, plenty of power and the handling is good. But unless you can't pass up a deal on the SL1 (like myself), go for the SL2. It has a more powerful engine, a nice covered central console storage area, nicer interior (seats have nicer fabric than SL1), bigger wheels, and a few other perks that make it superior to the SL1 for not much more money. I know all this because my boyfriend actually bought an SL2 recently, so I know that car well too, and, frankly, am somewhat jealous of his Saturn!
But still, I enjoy the heck out of my SL1 and would definitely consider buying another Saturn in the future.

Oh - and of course, it goes without saying that the sales experience is top-notch at Saturn!!!
