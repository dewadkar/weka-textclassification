            Excellent everything, love it, its got the get up and go that I need, manufactured great, way to go Jeep! 
This is my first SUV and it is great. I am very happy I got it, with other competitors my Jeep seemed to come out on top. Handles great on and off road. Very minium noise, sometimes going down the highway you may hear the wind but a very soft noise. The turning circle is excellent I can park parallel with ease. The Jeep takes in road bumps very well. It does get poor gas mileage (15 mpg). Otherwise great!! It has a wonderful look from the front and the back. The back door is very easy to use you just pull the handle once and the top glass opens and then another pull and the bottom will swing open. The interior has a great look and the seats are  comfortable.
The keyless entry has a button to open the back glass....very handy. When I bought this vehicle I was concerned with the space with 4 people in the family, I used to have a van, but the Liberty seems to seat 5 adults comfortably. And it has enough cargo room for our needs. This Jeep was our best purchase.
