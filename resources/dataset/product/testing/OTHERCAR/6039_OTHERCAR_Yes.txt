            As for Saturn's L-series, I must applause.

Again, I have driven each of the L100, L200, and L300 so I will try to hit base at on each of these vehicles.  To start off, when the L class(L meaning Large) first was kicked out by Saturn -- the cars had some massive problems that needed fixed.  As the years passed by, the L-model became a little more sleek, much more refined, and leaving little room for error.  In 2002 the L-series is finishing off strong and is bringing much potential for the 2003 L-cars that are a little roomier than the present models.

Back to the 2002's.  The L100 is offered in only the 4 cylinder engine, and without alot of the standard features that the 200 or 300 would have.  The L200, like the L100,  is only offered in the 4 cylinder engine, but comes with more features and is available in the 5 speed transmission.  The L300 is offered with either the 4 cylinder or the V6 engine.  The V6 is quite fun to drive, and has great pickup since the car is such light weight, but the problem persists in the engine cooler having problems after long usage.

Basic Negatives:
1. The window controls placement, located near the shifter.
2. The massive break dust emitted from the front brakes.
3. The Seats are nice, but not as comfortable as they could be.
4. The trunk release button seems like cheap plastic and is believed to be unreliable.
5. For a car that's considered "large" by Saturn, I would not go to the extreme of saying its a family car.

The Pros:
1. The 5 speed models have a safety feature to stop someone from accidentally putting it in reverse(a standard feature on European cars).
2. Very safe car for driver and passengers.
3. Great gas mileage for typical sedans.
4. Maintenance is not out of ordinary as long as you keep up on your oil changes.
5. Fun car to drive with a classy look to it.

I can say I really enjoy driving the L-cars around.  They are responsive and have some really nice features to them. They ride nice on the road with some slight cabin noises but nothing to crazy. All I can say is, you can't go wrong!
