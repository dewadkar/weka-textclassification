            Here is an update on my epinion about our Pontiac Montana 2000.  We have clocked about 25k miles on this van and we have had very few problems with it.  But there are some engineering things that could be improved!

One thing that bugs us is the compass.  If a couple of trucks pass us on the highway, it losses its direction.  You have to drive around in a couple of circles to help it find itself again.  My Lincoln, which was also equipped with a compass, never had that problem. 

I also used the cruise control extensively since we got the van and at first it seemed to be very cumbersome and easy to confuse with the windshield wipers. Now that I am used to it, the controls are ok, but it is still too easy to turn on the wipers, instead of setting the cruise. 

Another thing that I wish I could change is the seat recline in the front seats.  The control is a wheel that takes strong hands, which I do not have.  It also takes too much time to put the seat up or down.  I like a lever much better.  A lever would be easier to control and much quicker.

The radio has also has a lot of confusing controls, some which I still don't understand.  Fortunately, the main controls, seek, volume, am/fm are on the steering wheel, and that helps a lot.  I miss the compress feature on the Compact Disk player.  This feature evens out the sound of the CD and makes the sound much fuller.  Also the equalizer on our radio has a mind of its own and when it changes itself the sound quality drives us out of our skull.  Some settings are better for music and others for voice.  Then there is a right setting and a left setting, God knows what for.  And we never know why it keeps changing from one to another.  I wish we could get another radio that wasn't so arbitrary .  

The one thing I failed to note in my first epinion, was the ease to remove the rear seats.  We had to carry a lot of cargo and my husband pulled out the six individual rear seats in no time and lined them up in the garage.  When we returned he set them back again.  This makes our van do double duty as a pickup truck, much to our delight as we traded in a pickup for this van.  

That is all for now.  This car has a very comfortable ride and a good take off.  Pontiac, are you listening to what you can improve in this van????

Here is what I said when we first bought our new van in September 1999.  All these comments are still very true:

After shopping for a couple of weeks we decided to buy a 2000 Montana luxury Van.  

My grandkids absolutely love the automatic sliding door.  I love the compass and temperature console.  My husband loves all the electronic information and the driver side rear entry door. 
We like to travel and there is plenty of room for guests and luggage.  One thing though -- we found out the hard way, out battery went dead that not all the systems, lights, etc. shut down  after 10 minutes as it said in the directions.  We left the travel refrigerator plugged into the rear cargo area cigarette lighter and the next morning, nothing.  Had to call AAA.  Oh well. 
 
Another minor irritation:  The head rests are difficult to adjust.  The driver and front seat passenger head rests are cut out and look like a padded frame.  I guess this is so the rear passengers can see more.  My head just misses the top of the frame, so when I am lying back, my head feels like it is in a vice.  I overcome this with a small pillow.  Which defeats the purpose of the cutout for whoever is in the back seat.
  
Also had problems with the information console and the dealer had to replace it twice.  Other than that it is a smooth running car with  lots of whistles and bells you would expect to get in a Lincoln Continental.  <br><br>
