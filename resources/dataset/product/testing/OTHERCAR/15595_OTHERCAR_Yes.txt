            I've had my Sony Mavica FD91 for about a year now and couldn't be happier!  The high cost of film and developing pictures was preventing me from taking all the photos I wanted and my kids were growing up fast.  Even though the camera seemed expensive when I bought it (about $1000), I knew I'd save on media.  Not only are floppies inexpensive, they can be erased and reused; that alone justified the price of the camera. (You couldn't get me to switch to another media, not even cd.)  

This camera has gone everywhere with me -- on vacation, to museums, camping and rendezvous activities, weddings, friends' homes, parades, the Iowa State Fair.  I've used in in every kind of weather Iowa has; snow, sleet, rain, cold, hot, humid... okay, I've yet to snap a tornado.  

My daughter, 15 when I bought the camera, has been exploring and using all of the features since day one.  She's the one who plays with the fancy effects -- pastel, negative, etc. and uses it more than I do! I don't mind because it isn't expensive to USE.  We use floppies for the computer so they are always available and the lithium ion battery lasts and recharges fast -- we usually get just shy of two hours use between charges.  

It's nice to be able to shift between recording modes, quality and image size. Never before have I had a camera where I could adjust FLASH level! It has the clock, file numbers, disk tool and you can turn the beep on or off; nice when you're at a school play. Which reminds me, I can sit in the back row of a school auditorium and get great zoom shots of the actors on stage.  The mpeg movie feature is very handy. You don't need to carry a video camera with you to get short movies of the kids.  Really, how many of your family video shots are of any length?  And these are &quot;talkies,&quot; too, I've had good results with the sound.  What I'd do without steady shot and available auto focus, I don't know!  To get the shot I want I'll climb a tree, stand on the car hood, balance on whatever is handy and take one handed reach shots -- for which the LCD display is indispensable.  I wear glasses and have friends with severe vision problems; we LOVE the LCD viewer.  I do use the ordinary viewfinder when bright light conditions require it, but it isn't often.  Photography aside, this camera makes a great scanner substitute. I do a little desktop publishing with it. I also &quot;take notes&quot; with it. Just take a shot of the page in the book with the information you need; save the change you spend on copiers. 

I guess the best thing about having a digital camera is the economy and convenience. Timely results. No developing. Cheap floppies. Idiot proof. E-mailable.  Fine photo prints if you care to invest in special papers or printers, however I get great prints on my Canon BJC-6000 without special stuff!  

To be absolutely honest, there is one feature I'd improve if I could.  I'd put a protective frame of greater depth around the LCD screen. Not only would it shade the LCD screen from bright light and reflection like my old Yashica Mat; it would make it less vulnerable to scratches from buttons as the camera dangles from your neck.  That's it.  That's my only complaint.  I love this camera.
