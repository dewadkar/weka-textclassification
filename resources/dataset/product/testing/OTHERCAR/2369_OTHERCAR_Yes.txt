            I recently bought from my brother the second 1992 Maxima SE I have owned. The two are nearly identical, except for color. Both are SE 5-speed models with black leather interior.

The first one I bought used and drove it from 60,000 miles to 160,000 before trading it in. The only thing wrong with it was I had to replace the clutch slave cylinder (I think it was around $200). My brother liked it so well, that about a year after I sold mine, he bought one. This year, he decided to upgrade and I needed a new second car/work car and I bought his, so now it's MINE.

This one has a few more things that needed attention, but I bought it with 140,000 miles. First thing I had to replace was the water pump. This is an expensive fix (around $600) but I knew it was going out when I bought it. I also had to replace the driver side window regulator. The part was $60 and I did the work myself, saving maybe $150 in labor.

The second Maxima has problems with the bose stereo, but I think that's because it has an aftermarket head unit (alpine) that wasn't designed to work with the bose speakers and amps. The first one I left the original in and it played perfectly.

The big thing for the second one is the VTC gears are rattling. This is annoying and will eventually need to be fixed. It is a MAJOR repair (about $2,000) and if you are looking at buying a used 92-94 Maxima SE, listen for the ticking when the car is idling. If it is starting to tick, keep in mind that you will have to repair it sooner or later. 

There have been no other problems with either car and between my brother and I, we have driven the two cars roughly 200,000 miles.

As for the sportiness, the 92-94 Maxima SE (3rd Gen) is my favorite of all Maxima body styles. Obviously, the newest ones have more horsepower, but the 3rd Generation just looks "right" to me. It is roomy, but it's not a big car. It handles well for its size and the steering and shifting have a sportiness about them. 

Nissan glossed this car the 4DSC (four door sports car) for a reason -- it is head and shoulders above the same year Camry, Accord or Taurus. Both in sportiness and refinement. In fact, I don't believe you can get any of those with a 6-cyl. and a 5-speed combo (except the Taurus SHO) 

My car has so many miles on it and there are no squeaks or rattles. I have driven the car up to 140 mph and it is not much louder in the cabin than at 55 mph. You can have a relaxing, calm conversation at highway speeds and not feel like you are yelling. It still gets over 25 mpg, has no leaks of any kind and doesn't burn oil.

The automatic seat belts are a little irritating, but you get used to them. Also, the manual requires premium fuel, but I usually alternate between plus and super, especially when super nears the $2/gallon mark. I can't think of anything else bad to say about these cars, except watch for the VTC ticking.
