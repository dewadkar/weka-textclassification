            I purchased my 1993 Nissan Sentra new back in early 1993, a couple of years after my college graduation (I was still on a tight budget).  This was my third Nissan, as I had previously owned an late-70's Datsun 210 and a 1988 Sentra.  <i>Aside: my trust in Nissan cars led me to purchase a 1997 Maxima in 1999 (which I have also reviewed).</i>

I got a model E Sentra with a 5-speed manual transmission, without power steering nor air-conditioning.  I installed my own stereo, etc.

The engine is a 1.6 liter 4 at 110hp.  I get great mileage with this car; highway driving gets me between 39-to-41 mpg.

Currently I have almost 120k miles on this car.  <i>{Update 2002-Feb-08: 122k miles before selling}</i> I have replaced the brake pads/shoes only once.  The exhaust is STILL the original stainless steel exhaust!

<b>Pros:</b>
1. Strong engine; 110hp, 16-valve DOHC, variable valve timing (!!), fluid engine mounts, timing chain which does not need replacing (unlike a timing belt).  Very reliable.
2. High efficiency (with 5-spd manual).
3. Stainless steel exhaust.  One of the joints cracked in front of the catalytic converter, but I had it re-welded.  <i>Most people would have had the exhaust replaced when this happened, but only after being coerced by muffler sales people to do so.  You may have read other reviews that say they've replaced the exhaust several times, but once you replace the exhaust with non-Nissan exhaust it is no longer the reliability of the car that is in question when the exhaust goes bad the next time!</i>
4. Very sturdy feel.  Stiff body.
5. Very little rust for a car this age.

<b>Cons:</b>
1. A bit small inside, but that's why I bought it at the time; because it was small and efficient.
2. The color I have (Aztec red) is hard to match up when touching-up dings.
3. Could have had better lumbar support.
4. Driver-side door began sagging around 30K miles.  I had one of the hinges replaced under warranty.  <i>{Update 2002-Feb-08: I replaced the second driver-side door hinge at 122,000 miles.}</i>
5. During hot sunny weather, the speedometer sometimes wavers back and forth +/-2 mph about the speed you're going.  This problem seems to have disappeared over the past couple of years.

<b>Other:</b>
1. Brake pads and shoes have only been replaced once.
2. Suspension is still stiff and capable.
3. No leaks from the engine compartment.
4. Still original exhaust (but most people would have replaced the exhaust when the weld joint cracked).
5. CV-joint boots are still intact.  {<i>Update 2002-Feb-08: I replaced the CV-joint boots around 121,000 miles.</i>}
6. Still using original clutch.
7. Still runs like a champ and has always passed inspection since.

My wife and I will be trading (or selling) this car in another year when we buy a minivan.  I have no doubt that it'll still be running great.  I will be saddened to see it go.

<i>{Update: My wife and I purchased a 2001 Honda Odyssey minivan (I've written a review on it).  I sold my Sentra via a private sale to a grad student looking for transportation.  I am sad to have needed to sell it.}</i>
