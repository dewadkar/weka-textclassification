            I own a 1995 Chevrolet Astro van and it is a great addition to any family. I have had no major repairs in the five years I have owned it. The ride is smooth and it drives better than many cars. It is comfortable with plenty of leg room for my teenage children and their numerous friends. It is so roomy that once I had five teenagers with their book bags, a large snare drum and harness, three tubas, a saxophone, a clarinet and myself in it.

The few things I dislike however are the lack of room between the drink holders in the front and the dash which doesn't allow tall beverages to fit in or causes spillage due to the angle when they are removed. The glove compartment has basically no space at all. The air-conditioning vents are not made as well as they could be. 

I love the way I have little glare unlike the mini-vans that have too much dash. I have great visibility from my side mirrors and the electric control which allows me to adjust to my comfort. When my kids are grown I may not need the van as much but even if I switch to a car I will definitely buy a Chevrolet. The only reason not to buy this van is you that you don't need a larger vehicle.<br><br>
