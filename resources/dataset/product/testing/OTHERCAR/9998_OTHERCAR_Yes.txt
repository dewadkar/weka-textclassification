            You're old clunker is ready to kick the bucket. So you find yourself swallowed up in a pool of new cars, and can't decide where your money will treat you best. There are a slue of new cars in the 9,000 - 14,000 price range that come pretty well equipped. I hope this review will help you decide if the Kia Sephia will be the one for you.


<b>Price</b>

MSRP
$10,800-$16,600

<b>Handling</b>

Noticeable difference without the ABS option when braking hard. The car shimmers a bit when slamming the brakes at about 60mph to a dead stop. Turning ratio could be better. Too much road noise. Suspension is fairly tight.  

<b>Performance</b>

This 16-valve fuel injected engine is not shy (1.8 liter). She produces 125 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and likes to use it. From a dead stop, it launches rather well (Torque - 108lb per foot at 4500 rpm). The Sephia has more horsepower than most cars in its class. Passing power could be better (45mph and above).

<b>Interior</b>

Well, this is one are they saved money in. The seats are not so comfortable, and the overall interior looks rather cheap. Too many cheap plastic parts. Reminds me of the 1992 Saturn.

<b>Exterior</b>

Nice body style, and a good quality paint job make the Sephia rather sexy. The wheelbase could be better, with a wider tire.

<b>Safety</b> 

The Sephia has a collapsible steering column, reinforced crumple zones (for impact), steel side-door impact beams, dual airbags, energy-absorbing bumpers and child-safety locks. There's also an illuminated trunk release handle in case you get locked in the trunk. 

<b>Fuel Economy</b>

Tank capacity 13.2 gallons 
Unleaded Fuel (87 octane or higher) 
Manual transmission (5-speed) 23 city & 29 highway
Automatic transmission (4-speed w/overdrive)  22 city & 32 highway 


<b>Warranty</b>

-Limited Powertrain 10 years or 100,000 miles 
-Limited Basic 5 years or 60,000 miles 
-Limited Anti-Perforation 5 years or 100,000 miles 
-Roadside Assistance 5 years/unlimited miles 


<b>Overall Rating</b>

Scale 1-10 (10 best)

I give this car a 6.5. For the price it's hard to beat the features and performance.
