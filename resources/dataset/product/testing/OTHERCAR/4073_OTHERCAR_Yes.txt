                 As one who was reluctant to buy a GM vehicle, and a little put off by the size of vans, I'll admit our purchase of a '98 Chevy Venture has been a pleasant surprise.  We've put 30,000 miles on the van in 21 months, and it continues to be a quiet, solid, good-handling ride.  
     With the van's second and third seat rows removed, it is an amazing cargo hauler.  We've used it to move once, and it gets regular duty hauling furniture.  The interior finish (heavy-duty plastic and carpet) is standing up well to our use, and the exterior has retained its factory-floor bronze good looks.
     I spend more than an hour a day in the command seat, and it has been a good commuter vehicle, even easy to park.  The back seats are less spacious and comfortable, but they're roomy enough, certainly for kids.
     Changing the back-seat configuration is the one downside of this vehicle.  Getting the seats in and out is a sweaty, finger-threatening exercise that makes you want to find the best overall seat configuration and leave it at that.  There is a recall on the installation mechanism, but we haven't gotten the car in yet for the work.
     With that reservation, I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to haul a family or a sofa.
