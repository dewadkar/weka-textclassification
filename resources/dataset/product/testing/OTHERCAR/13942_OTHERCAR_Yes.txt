            I bought this vehicle used with approximately 10,000 miles on it. The price was right, less than 18K, and the warranty provided by the Subaru dealership was superb. They offered 5 years of bumper-to-bumper coverage i.e. if anything went wrong with the vehicle Subaru would cover the costs. 

I bought it for two reasons 1) Subaru's reputation for being a reliable vehicle and 2) it's excellent performance under bad driving conditions. I must admit I have been very pleased with the latter. I have been in very difficult driving situations with over three feet of snow and have never experienced a problem. Last winter I found myself to be the only SUV on the road when a large snow storm hit the northeast. 

As for the reliability of the car I have been a little disappointed. First of all, my brakes have lost a significant amount of power recently. This may be a result of buying the car used but nonetheless it did not please me. In addition, my brake light continues to come on when the hand brake is not engaged. While these things have not prevented me from driving they do tend to annoy. 

Some ancillary benefits of the wagon are that it handles very well on the road and has plenty of room to seat five comfortably. I was considering the Forrester wagon but the back seat is cramped for anybody over 5 feet 9 inches. The back seat of the Outback provides plenty of room. 

Overall I have been very happy with the performance of the car. It gets good mileage (approximately 26 miles/gallon), handles well, and is a safe car with a driver side airbag. 

I would recommend this car to anybody with a family or anyone engaged in an active lifestyle that needs the extra room it provides. It is safe, affordable, and ultimately a very practical vehicle.
For those of you who need cars with a little more sex appeal I would not recommend this. Stick to a sports car with a little more pizzazz. <br><br>
