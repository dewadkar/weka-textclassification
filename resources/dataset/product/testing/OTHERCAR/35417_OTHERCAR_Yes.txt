            The pinnacle of my automotive experience was my 1992 Mercedes 190E, 2.6.

I bought it in 1993, as a demonstrator model. It was love at first drive.

Granted this model is used for taxi cabs in Germany and other parts of Europe, but for me it was the finest, best performing car I'd ever owned.
It is still a Mercedes-Benz, and I looked forward to getting up and going to work every day I had it, 'cause I got to drive &quot;the Benz&quot;.

The unmistakable &quot;thunk&quot; of the doors when closing them, and the ability to soak-up any bump, pothole, washboard with wavering or even a rattle endeared me to this automobile instantly. The powerful six cylinder engine had extremely &quot;long legs&quot;, a real freeway flyer ! Premium fuel only, please !

To many, a Mercedes-Benz represents luxury.  That couldn't be farther from the truth, if you consider luxury as plush overstuffed seats, and a wallowy, soft ride.  German autos are actually the opposite.  With firm, seats, covered in rugged, hide and a very reactive ride that is far from plush these cars are designed to be driven. Driven hard.  Driven precisely. Cutting in and out of traffic. No problem. This baby drives like it was on rails, on dry pavement or in torrential rain.  I always felt secure in this vehicle, and at any speed.

Braking....remarkable. Not a lot of gimmickry.  You'll find more of that in your &quot;average&quot; Caddy or Lincoln.  

So the driving experience was always great. The ownership experience, overall had some &quot;baggage&quot; attached to it.  Here's some things to keep in mind when considering this type of vehicle:

The manufacturer specifies &quot;Premium&quot; fuel. Your Technician, &quot;Fritz&quot; will insist on it!

That incredible handling.....requires EXPENSIVE tires. And frequently.
This type of car typically gets 25,000 out of a set of shoes.  You won't replace them at the corner gas station either!  They are specially rated for this type of car, it's heavy weight and speed capability.

The remarkable braking?  They take braking VERY seriously in the land of the speed-limitless autobahn.  You'll take it very seriously at the shop. The pads wear out about twice as quickly as you may be accustomed to, as do the rotors which most American and Japanese autos almost NEVER need replacement of.  Also, they like to flush the brake fluid annualy....an expensive ritual I've never done before....or since.

Even the oil changes cost 50 bucks or more. Twice that of your typical vehicle.  Air filter for this car....75 bucks !  Wiper blade (a single wiper arm which sweeps 89% of the windshield...amazing) replacement at 25 bucks...PLUS installation. Don't even attempt this one on your own!  Then there's the tune-ups, tire rotations, &quot;flex-disc&quot; replacements. 

My average Visa charge at the dealership was over 700 bucks!  If you want to look good, and feel good while you drive a Mercedes....better have a high limit on your plastic!

All in all, I adored this auto.  I looked forward to driving it every day I had it. (not a feeling my Toyota 4Runner has imbued in me....but the oil changes are 9.95 a piece on it!)  It WAS expensive, but I knew that before I signed on the dotted line.  However, in my occupation (sales rep) I do a lot of driving...which prompted a lot of miles, causing a lot of service.
Costing me a lot of dough!  

I do not regret it, I don't have it now, but I WILL get one again someday when I don't drive 30,000 miles a year, and owning something like that is more practical. I'll always fondly remember that car. 

So, perhaps &quot;luxury&quot; actually means being &quot;not so practical&quot;. In which case, the 190E indeed, is a luxury car!
