            PUNCH BUGGY RED! 
The VW Bug. Newly released a couple of years ago, built on the same platform as a few other VW cars, it has become a great success.
So much so, that I happen to have two friends, married guys who bought this car. The Beetle is available in 5 different models, but each of them have the standard 2.0 Liter Gas driven version.
At first glance the Beetle isn't terribly reminiscent of the past beetle. The past beetle had more lines in the design whereas the current Beetle is almost entirely smooth.
Today's Beetle comes with a few different engine variants, a turbo and non-turbo. The non turbo is what both of my friends have. The Bug is assembled in Mexico, and imported here, thanks to NAFTA, can you hear that giant sucking sound? That is the sound of jobs going South. Ross Perot was right! 

The 2.0 Liter Bug puts out a mere 115 horsepower. Now that doesn't seem like a decent amount, and in fact, seems laughable. But the little Beetle does accelerate quickly, due largely to it's low weight. The Turbo edition reaches 150 hp.

<b>Interior</b>: Good room up front. More like, Excellent front room, when first sitting in the front you will notice a dashboard so large it would seem like you could serve dinner on it. The gauges and controls are all easily reached by the driver and passenger. When they light up at night, they are a really cool purple/blue and red mix. I hadn't ever seen this color in a car and it certainly looks better than the common orange or green lights. The Seats recline in a strange way, there is a knob on the seat facing the door which must be turned to recline. This requires extra effort to recline as opposed to the common lever action. Also, the knob cover can be broken off, leaving you with a circular metallic disk with teeth. It is pretty hard, AND painful to recline the seat when the knob is in this condition.

<b>Back Seat Room</b>. I can fit back there. I'm around 5 10, and I could sit there for probably 2 hours or so. They do good at making the rear of the front seat concave so that you have more knee room. Really the back seat is comparable to the back seat of the Mustang 5.0 GT, in room. Not a lot, but if you're the only one back there, you can sit there for a couple of hours.

<b>Engine</b>, as mentioned before, has decent acceleration, and the little Bug has a good speed potential. You can get the little car to 120mph. But of course I wouldn't know anything about breaking the law like that.

<b>Handling</b>: very good, it is small and light, it can corner good. At High Speeds (over 100) it does feel a bit less stable, and has a little drift to it. This shouldn't be a surprise with something so light when the wind resistance starts playing with it.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>: The stats from the factory will claim 32 mpg on the highway. This is great, but I haven't met anyone who has gotten more than 27 from highway driving. Still, 27 is better than most cars. 

<b>Trunk Size</b>: The rear seats can be folded down to stuff more bodies in the trunk. It will certainly not fit many bodies in the trunk, but you can easily fit all your groceries in there.
Taking up space in the trunk can be a CD changer. The Stereo system in the Bug is all wired for a CD Changer. 

<b>Security</b>: The Bug comes with this nifty little key, the key itself has the alarm stuff all on it. There is no little plastic square thing to carry with your keychain, it is now a rubberized head on the key. Pretty excellent if you ask me. But no doubt it costs more to replace than getting a key made at Wal-Mart for a buck or two.

Visibility out of the bug is excellent, as the windows are very much like a dome over you.
Standard equipment include air bags all around, power everything (except seats) and ABS brakes. One owner of the Bug has already had to have his right side power windows electronics and motors replaced. Not to encouraging in a one year old car, but thankfully all under warranty.

<b>FINALLY</b>: The Cup Holders are very strange. They have some sort of rubber lining and they grip a coke can with some authority. I had to actually dent my can to get it back out.
This is a good thing, as it will prevent many spills while taking hard corners.

<b>Most importantly</b>
Now about this VW Beetle available in &quot;VAPOR&quot; color, with only 2000 available only on-line. This is one of the stupidest marketing ideas I have ever heard of. Vapor? WHO CARES? The morons who actually buy a car with the VAPOR color are people who must have a car that only 1999 other people can have. They require their car to define themselves as &quot;special&quot; and in fact, they are. As no one of sound mind would waste their money buying a car which is over priced on the net because of a silly color gimmick.
If you want a Beetle with a unique color, take it to an auto body shop and have a custom color made up for you.

Besides, just how many punches do you dish out for Punch Buggy Vapor?
Will we even know Punch Buggy Vapor when we see it?
I doubt it.

PUNCH BUGGY RED! I saw it first! R-E-D RED!
