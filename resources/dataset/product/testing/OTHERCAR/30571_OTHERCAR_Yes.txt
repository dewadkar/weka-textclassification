            I bought my Honda Pilot for MSRP in Detroit.Caution if you are planning to purchase the Pilot don't pay more than MSRP;I had to shop around to get mine for MSRP.In Detroit this S.U.V is very popular so all the dealer's are trying to make money by boasting the MSRP up.Advice if you have to go to another more Rural city to get the Pilot for MSRP;than go to another city to save a thousand dollars.
I have had my Pilot EX cloth for about a month now.I bought cloth because during the Winter it gets real cold,and cloth absorbs some of the cold climate.The four wheel drive system is very useful in all rainy,muddy,and snowy conditions.The seating positions are high making the drive much more fun.The tires on all Honda Pilot's are mud and snow tires.Also did I mention that there are no hubs on the tires, because the tires are Alloy.The air-conditioning,and heating inside the Pilot is superb.Also electronically the climate can be set inside the Pilot;and the fan speeds would adjust automatically.The dual climate controll system keeps the rear cold,and hot.I used to own a 1991 model year Honda Accord,with about 197,000 miles on it.The only thing that broke on the Accord in that span of time was the air-conditioning compressor;that broke when I had a 146,000 miles on the Accord.I got it fixed for 500 dollars.You be the judge here don't you think the Pilot just like the Oddysey and MDX would be able to accomplish the same fead as my Accord did.The bottom line is that the Pilot is a very safe,reliable,dependable,and fun to drive S.U.V.
Drive this S.U.V for yourself trust me you will like it alot more than you do now;looking at pictures and reading about it!!
