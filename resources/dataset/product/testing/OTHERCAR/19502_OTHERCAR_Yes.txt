            Last month I tested a few digital cameras. One of them was Casio QV-3000EX. This are my remarks about this camera.

The camera uses 1/1.8&quot; CCD (Sony) matrix with resolution 3.34 megapixels
(3.24 effective megapixels). Maximum picture size is 2048 x 1536 pixels.

The camera has enough little sizes (134,5 � 80,5 � 57,5 mm) and weights
about 320 g (without battery). Design is simple and at that time strict.

Standart kit includes:
- the camera,
- cables: TV-out, serial, USB,
- software: PhotoLoader, Panorama Editor, Internet Explorer, Adobe Acrobat reader, Apple QuickTime 3
- CompactFlash card 8/16 Mb, support 340 Mb IBM microdrive
- case and strap,
- manuals.

The camera has a lot of features. The shutter is from 2 second to
1/1000 second (and Bulb), 3:1 optical zoom (for this price! - it's good) and 2:1 digital zoom. LCD (1,8�, 122100 pixels, resolution � 555 � 222) are placed on the back. The zoom, menus and navigation are enough intuitive.

Output format - JPEG, TIFF and AVI. Included software is excellent and to allow you to do with yours photos all what you want.

Indoors photos are nice, but outdoors shots required improvement. Some things look unnatural. For printing shots from this camera you need a printer about 200 dpi, because 2048 X 1536 is 8.5&quot; X 11&quot;. It's roughly 200 dpi.

Version Casio QV-3000 EX Plus with 340 Mb IBM microdrive has price about $1000.<br><br>
