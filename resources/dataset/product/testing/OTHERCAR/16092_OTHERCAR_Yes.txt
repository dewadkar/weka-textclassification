            I recently purchased a 2000 jeep grand Cherokee limited. Never have i ever been so satisfied with my car. I got all the bells and whistles, and  it was still under $35,000. This car handles like a dream, taking back country roads like they were paved. With the enhanced suspension package, even large pot holes are not felt. One of my favorite features on the car is the heated seats. I love starting my car and having my entire back warmed up instantly. I'm not sure this car would be a good choice for teenage drivers. Since sport utility vehicles in general are likely to roll, and since this one has so much power under the hood, i would be a little hesitant to give it to my teen.<br><br>
