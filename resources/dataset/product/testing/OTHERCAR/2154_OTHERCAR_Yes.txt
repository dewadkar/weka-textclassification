            I received my 1994 Isuzu Rodeo LS for my 18th birthday.  My parents listened to months of whining for a new Honda Passport.  They decided to research the Honda and found that the Isuzu is the same exact car, with the same exact engine (as a matter of fact, Honda's engine said Isuzu on it), with a better warranty.  So, along came by blue baby=)

Inside I have nice, neutral colored interior (tans), a CD player and a cassette deck, it's one of the few manual drive LS models of its time, has a sunroof, power windows, power locks (locked and unlocked through driver's side only), and plenty of room.  

The back seat is a comfortable ride, even for my long-legged friends.  With the front seat slid fully back, the back seat passenger still had room to sit like a normal person.  Seats fold down in back to create one large cargo area and with it I've moved myself and several others from apartment to apartment.  

My Rodeo has 95,000 miles on it; the clutch has been replaced once (very expensive though--approx. $1000) and I've maintained it with regular oil changes and services.  

Two problems I've encountered over the years, especially more recently (since about the 80-85,000 mile mark):  1.  Door lock on the front passenger side bounces when I attempt to lock the car whether from the inside or out.  Occasionally it doesn't lock and if I'm not in too much of a hurry, I'll remember to go around and lock it.  2.  Back seat, passenger side window stopped working one day.  Mechanics say it will cost approx. $1000 or more to fix.  I don't usually have more than one passenger, so this hasn't been a real problem worth fixing.  

Great car!!  I've driven it occasionally in 4wheel drive, in heavy snow, and it handles pretty well.  Easier to drive than my folks' huge GMC Yukon XL and much smoother than my sibling's old Jeep Wrangler.  Comfortable, and affordable.  Probably not the vehicle for a family; I hear they don't do so well in accidents.  Also, no airbags in this early model.  <br><br>
