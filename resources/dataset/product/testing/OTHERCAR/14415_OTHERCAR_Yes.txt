            I just took delivery of a loaded black M45 w/chrome wheels, graphite interior and a rear spoiler. When I got to the dealer she was all shined up and ready and simply beautiful. It was parked out front and at 3 people were hawking it when I walked up. I got a great deal as the car was 51,500 dollars retail and they gave it to me for 46,000 not much over invoice, thanks Ray Catena Infiniti! 
The salesman was awesome and knew the product well and trained me for 1 hour on the interior. I knew allot already though cause I have been reading up on this car but he was still so helpful. So then I got to drive it home and I can't begin how happy I am with this car. The seats are just right for me, very supportive. The heat is just perfect and I think this is the first car where the cooled seats actually cool. The whole car gives you the feeling you did something right and you constantly feel connected to the road through the wheel. It's tough to explain but the power assist steering works great and is a flawless setup. The brakes are also great but very different compared to other cars. Most cars of performance have large brake discs like 12-13 inches on the front and utilize mostly front braking pressure, like 75% front brake. The Infiniti has small discs 11 inches or so all the way around and brakes 55% front. This is a racecar setup and you get very little weight shift when braking and entering a corner. This gives no nose dive and great handling nothing I ever experienced in a sedan this big. 
The performance is unreal. My last car was an Audi TT that was heavily modded with a chip, exhaust, intake and a bunch of other stuff. My 0-60 with my auto meter was 5.6 seconds in that car. I dusted 2 z's and a G35 coupe just last week with it. I expected the M45 to be slower anyway but it wasn't. I hooked up my auto meter in my M45 when I got it. Just yestarday I was confident to give it a stab at 0-60 just to see. Ok here's the deal... with the VDC on and car in drive my 0-60 was 5.85 seconds BUT....I turned the VDC off and manually shifted and got 5.21 seconds...a big difference and let me tell you, its very felt even in the seat. Next time I did it I screwed up hitting the gas too hard and lit up the rear tires for a 100 feet or so. It's still new and I don't wanna beat on it so I'll try it again real soon. I love the shifter though and after coming out of a manual shifter all my driving life the shifter in the M45 keeps me out of withdrawl. It even slows the car down like a real shifter and when you get good in the corners you can match your max rpm's with your shift points, lots of fun! But I notice with the VDC on it is a different feel and is a tick slower no doubt.
The car handles good but my tires are new and I haven't pushed it all too much but it feels tight and would definitely push if i went too hard, but when I break the tires in we'll see. Exterior Lights are like day out in the middle of the night and the fogs look cool lit up. Nice touch with the mirror blinkers too, it looks classy blinking at nite. My friend said I came up behind him on the highway and he was scared of the front end like I was gonna eat him or something, it's threatening! Something I need here with Jersey drivers. The interior is just great, You can adjust the seats many ways to get your comfort and then you can set it memory wise and never lose it, I found I've used this option already everybody wants to drive it. I have the tech package and the premium so it has allot to offer. My boss has a CL500 and he said my M45 has every option he has (except the integrated phone he has) and its what 50,000 cheaper? The navigation is just flawless like most japanese imports have. But the Infiniti birdseye and its jillions of navigating options help you find your way easily and the voice guidence controls work flawlessly to get you home  for even the worst drivers on the trickiest roads. My Audi was poor in this department. The navigation and audio controls I got used to in one day and I love it. Anybody who said it was confusing did'nt have the car long enough to determine how great it is. The intelligent cruise control is another new amazing innovation. It automatically works when you place the cruise control on, the sensors determine the car's speed in front of you and slows you down accordingly. This is so strange at first because the car is actually slowing down and applying brakes according to the car in front. It definitely can help reduce any accidents and I found I finally have a cruise control I can use. I even have the fine measurement of increasing speed by just 1 mph difference on the wheel adjuster via digital readout on the dash. The steering wheel controls are quick and easy to use as you can control volume, mode and channel changing. The audio system has a great option where it searches for popular tagged stations and with the voice control you can just say the station and bingo, there it is. The Bose system is very loud and can blow you out if you want. One thing I did'nt like was the is that at night the wheel controls aren't lit. This was tough when I was learning but I have it memorized now. The automatic tire pressure monitor finally reduces my anxiety of that tire looking low. A really nice must have.
I love the way the seat moves out to let you out if the car and I'm still learning the voice commands. Other than that I hope this gives everybody the insight of the Infiniti product and where it's going. I'm the only one that seems to have this car as it's not selling well. I think due to the styling but man I get stares like crazy more than my TT and I think it's one of those cars you just have to see in person. You won't be sorry if you get one!!!
