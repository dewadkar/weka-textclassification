            I bought the Polaroid PDC 640 because I needed a digital camera to list items on Ebay. I purchased it at 3pm in the afternoon and had 5 items posted on Ebay with 3 nice shots of each item by 6:30 pm, the same day.

The biggest problem I had with taking pictures with this camera was getting enough light on the object to make it show up. Once I had gathered enough lamps in the room, the pictures seemed to be fine, when set on the medium resolution.

The serial cable that came with the camera did not fit into the camera well and I had a heck of a time for about 45 minutes trying to get the PC to recognize that the camera was hooked to it. Polaroid technical help was nice enough, but not a big help. The wait on the phone was about 25 minutes and then I was told to call my PC manufacturer because Polaroid assumed it was my PC and not their cable. Needless to say, a new cable is on it's way to my home from Polaroid, after another 20 minute call.

I'm not photographer and this is the newest camera I've purchased in about 7 years. I like the ease of snapping the picture and then uploading it and posting it. The picture quality is about what I'd expect from a lower price camera, but I think it's a decent item to start my digital camera experience on. I really like having an LCD on the back of it, to see the picture and decide whether to keep it or delete it.

The camera works great for me in the house, because I can use the AC adapter and that cuts down on battery use. I do tend to get my hand in the way of the flash at times. It seems to be in an awkward spot.

Overall, I think it's a good beginner camera. I can see upgrading in less than a year.

Update:

I am now waiting for my 3rd camera. The first one wouldn't make power contact with the batteries and the department store replaced it. The second camera had the computer interface fall off the power board. Right now, the department store is working on getting me a new one. If they can't, I need to pay to have it shipped back to Polaroid (insured and tracked) for repair, which can take from 2 weeks to when ever, which means, no digital camera for Christmas or the vacation right after Christmas.

In a nut shell- the quality and workmanship is awful.
