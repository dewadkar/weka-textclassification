                 What makes the Canon PowerShot A50 a really great camera, in my opinion, is the great pictures that it can take for its small size.  It's small enough to carry around with you so that you can take those impromptu shots.  It's sturdy and compact and has powerful features like an optical zoom.  You should definitely consider getting a camera with an optical zoom.  You'll regret it afterwards if you don't.  The only negative gripe I have about this camera is that the low light photographs might come out blurry.  This happens because it automatically uses a slower shutter and if you're holding the camera, 75% of the time your hands will move and blur the image.  Otherwise, I've been really impressed with the photographs that come out of this thing. 

     The main use I have with this camera is create a digital photo album which I can share through the web with my friends and family.  I recently send out my digital pictures to get them printed up on glossy photography paper.  They actually came out decent and the cost was only $.50 per 4x6 picture.

     This camera is a great ice breaker at parties or get-togethers.  The crisp LCD screen allows you to look at the pictures right after you've taken them and usually everyone gets a kick out of seeing themselves.  It's instant gratification.

I've got sample pictures and more on this camera on my webpage.  Please come and check it out.  http://www.idrive.com/mistered21/web/canonA50/intro.html<br><br>
