            From the outside the new Audi TT looks like a somewhat fancier version of the new Beetle. A closer look reveals the degree to which Audi has allowed its designers free reign in this wonderfully styled vehicle. Inside everything is brushed stainless steel, leather and graphite fiber. The interior is breathtaking in how terrific the industrial design is. It looks cool and modern, with repeated circular design themes echoing the Audi circle emblem. I shoehorned my 6'2&quot; self into the tiny car and was so overwhelmed by how wonderful the interior is, how sophisticated and well thought out it was, that I almost forgot how uncomfortable I was. I did start to think about how this car would be day after day and realized that this is just not practical for me. 

But practicality is not what the TT is about, this is a fun vehicle. This is a car meant for specific people:
-If your primary vehicle is a mini van, station wagon (including you Subaru yuppies), or family sedan and you have just hit age 40, better get one of these to go with your mid-life crisis and hair implants. 
-If you just got out of college and have been driving around in a Gremlin, its time for an upgrade. 
-Get one in silver and set it in your living room as a sculpture, this car looks like it should be in the Guggenheim not on the road.
