            Although I've concentrated my attention on ultra-portable and mid- to high-end subcompact digital cameras, I've tried to pay attention to the more budget conscious digital camera segment.  When a high school buddy of mine asks me to go shopping with him for a digital camera, I happily say yes and arrange for an appropriate day to go into the city to help him buy his camera (what can you say, not everybody is willing to buy over the internet).  His desires were a camera capable of up to 8 1/2 x 11 prints with some manual controls and a size that wasn't overly bulky... but didn't need to be ultracompact.  We wound up at J&R Camera World so he could spend his hard earned cash.  This happened in about mid to late March.

If you haven't read some of my other camera reviews, I already had a preference to Canon and Nikon digital cameras (before I got my hand on the hot little Pentax Optio S which I eagerly awaiting my $85 price match).  The J&R saleman tried to steer my friend towards the Canon PowerShot S230 saying that almost everyone who made a digcamera purchase got that hot little number (<a href="/content_78701170308">You can read my review of it here</a>).  However, the S230 lacked the manual controls he desired.  After looking at several cameras, his focus fell on an Canon with no price.  The salesman told him it was a new Canon and was on sale for a neat $329.  After playing with this new Canon, my friend checked what the return policy was and produced his good old credit card... an AmEx Gold card to use for later pricematching.

<b>A quick word about pricing...</b>

The camera retails for $349, but you can find the camera as low as $274 on the internet (the price we used for pricematching).  If you catch the right deals for the Dell Home Software and Peripherals site, you can get very close to this price.  Read my epinions article <a href="/content_3087507588">The Art of Buying... Getting your money's worth!</a> to see how to lower the price of purchasing electronics.

<i><b>My Overall Thoughts</b>

After spending several days of taking shots and comparing it to the shots from cameras that I owned (The S230 at the time and the Pentax Optio S in the past week), I feel that the A70 is an overall solid digital camera that provides alor of bang for your buck and is reasonable on your wallet!  You sacrifice a bit of size and have only a plastic camera body but you get a fairly full featured consumer level camera with room to grow for amateur photographers.  Picture quality was good to excellent in most conditions and the camera was a breeze to use.  The additional of usabilty elements that first showed up in the S45/50/400 make this camera's flexibility easy to access.  There are few overall weaknesses in this medium to large digital camera for the general consumer.

<b>Pros:</b>

1) 3 MegaPixel Camera
2) 3x Optical Zoom, 3.2 Digital Zoom
3) FUNC button
4) Non-propriatary battery... uses 4 AA batteries!
5) Decent retail price ($349)... excellent street price
6) Wide range of user defined/selectable manual modes
7) 5 point AiAF system (Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus)
8) DIGIC processor (specialized processor made by Canon specifically for digital cameras... supposedly improves camera photo quality) 
9) iSAPS (Intelligent Scene Analysis based on Photographic Space) for improved camera focus and white balancing. 
10) Direct printing to DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) compatible printers.
11) Optional lens adapter can be purchased to add lens to the A70
12) Battery life!

<b>Cons</b>

1) Plastic body does not feel as sturdy as S and G series cameras
2) Flimsy Compact Flash slot and Battery covers
3) A tad bit bulky feeling although dimensions and weight are less than S45/50 cameras.

</i><b>The S35?</b>

For all the features and flexibility this camera offers, you would wonder why it's considered a budget camera.  The only part of the A70 that fits the definition of budget is the camera body/case.  If this had the same body as the S45/S50, you would have called this the PowerShot S35!  The A70 has dimensions of roughly 3.98 x 2.52 x 1.24 inches and weighs 7.58 oz. before the batteries and Compact Flash card are added.  With batteries and the CF card, the camera weighs around 11 1/2 oz.!  Strangely enough, the camera feels bulky even though it is noticably smaller than the S45 and S50 PowerShot models.  The polycarbonate plastic body feels sturdy enough although noticably cheaper than the S series PowerShots.

The body design is more reminiscent of the G series PowerShots and prosumer level cameras.  The design hints at being more than just a budget camera.  The front of the camera holds the lens, optical viewfinder window, small microphone, flash, and AF/red-eye lamp.  You'll also note a button on the lower right side of the lens that releases the ring around the lens barrel to allow for the optional ring adapter for lens attachment.  There is also a large hand grip created by the AA battery compartment.  The right of the camera has the cover to the CF slot and one eyelet for the strap for the camera.  The left has a rubber cover that protects the USB port, A/V out, and DC in jacks.  You will also find the CR1220 lithium-ion battery slot that powers the internal memory for camera settings.  The top of the camera houses the mode dial, shutter button, zoom lever around the shutter button, the other end of the eyelet for the strap, power button, and the built-in speaker.  The bottom of the camera is a centered tripod mount and the cover to the battery compartment (4 AA batteries).

The back of the camera has a 1.5 inch LCD monitor, the optical viewfinder, a switch to pick from capture mode to playback mode, a 4 direction D-pad, and 4 multifunction buttons... one being the all powerful FUNC button (one of the best features that Canon has added to its interface to date).

The camera turns on in about 3 seconds.

<b>Hozza about the battery?</b>

The use of 4 AA sized batteries really adds bulk and size to the camera but gives the A70 better than average battery life.  Canon rates it between 250-350 shots with the LCD on depending on whether you use alkaline batteries or the special NiMH battery.  Canon rates the camera at 800-1000 shots with the LCD off.  You're probably better off getting your own set of 4 rechargable NiMH batteries maybe even two sets.  That compares quite favorably with the S45/50 cameras.  Seeing how $35 will get you a Panasonic quick charger and 12 AA NiMH batteries at a CostCo or a BJ's Wholesale Club... that's a good deal on the batteries.

Another upside is the ability to use regular AA batteries in case you forget to charge up your batteries.

<b>Mode Dial</b>

You want options?!... Well, you got them.  The mode dial allows you to choose anywhere from fully automatic operation to complete manual control.  The mode dial has instant settings for Aperture Priority, Shutter-Speed Priority, Program AE, Portrait Mode, Landscape Mode, Night Scene Mode, Fast Shutter, Slow Shutter, Stitch-Assist, and Movie mode.  That enough options for you?

<b>Taking Photos</b>

The A70 takes exceptional pictures... I dare say that the picture quality overall is about the same as the S230 in most respects.  Colour reproduction is very good... I had no complaints.  Skin tones and pastel colors looked natural.  Primary colors were pretty dead on.  Pictures overall were fairly sharp and suitable for prints up to 8x10 size.  However, 8x10 prints from shots by the S230 seemed sharper.  The red-eye reduction mode was strangely subpar (on the level of the S230) with quite a few photos stuck with dreaded red-eye.  However, night and low light shots were better than that of the the S230 in my opinion.

Continuous shot mode seemed a bit slower than Canon's rated time of 2.2 shots per minute.  Having the LCD off helped a bit with speed.  Shot speed is relatively fast to capture and process... most likely due to the DiGiC processor.  It takes about a second to capture photos with the AutoFocus beam off.  It can take up to 2 1/2 seconds with it on... depending on lighting and complexity of the objects in the AutoFocus sensor areas.

There are some other selectable settings on the A70.  White balance control, picture resolution (Small 640x480, Medium1 1024x768, Medium2 1600x1200, and Large 2048x1536), Compression size (Normal, Fine, and Superfine... but no RAW file save capability on A70), light metering, and others.

<b>Movies?!</b>

Warning, this budget camera has a movie mode.  You can record up to 3 minute clips in 320x240 and 160x120 resolution at 15 frames per second.  You also can take 30 second clips at 640x320 resolution at 15 frames per second.  The Canon PowerShot S230 is the only other Canon camera in this price range with a 640x480 video capture mode!

<b>Other Features?</b>

The camera can take voice memos.  Sorry no world clock and stuff like that.

<b>Software and Lens Adapter</b>

Sorry... my friend didn't buy the lens adapter and doesn't use the included software.  Again, I use a card reader and Photoshop.  My friend went with my advice for a card reader but uses Ulead Photo editing software.

<b>The Package?</b>

The A70 basic package comes with a paltry 16MB CF card, USB cable, A/V cable, manual, software CD-ROMs, a wrist strap, and 4 AA batteries that don't last all that long.

<b>What do you need?</b>

A much bigger CF card and rechargable AA batteries.
