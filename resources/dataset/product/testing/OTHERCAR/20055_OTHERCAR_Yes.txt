            I currently own a 00 BMW M5 and a 00 BMW X5(check out my article about it). Having knowledge on many vehicles on the market, my father took me truck shopping. I recommended the BMW X5, but having 8 in the family that vehicle was out of the question. So we looked into the &quot;FULL SIZE&quot; SUV's. When I looked through and driven, two vehicles stood out. The Toyota Land Cruiser and the GMC Yukon XL. We compared materials, options, and price. Finally he decided on the Yukon XL. This machine was pretty in the color my father picked. The Indiglo Blue made it look so desirable to look at. He opt. for the full option in this vehicle and the sticker added up to a hefty $45,017. It was well worth it though, the leather is so buttery soft, climate control was on par with BMW, and the ride can melt away those long highway miles. Driving it was a simple task. You would think with a vehicle this big the turning ratio would be hell, but it wasn't. It so smooth while being driven. The handling is great too(in a big truck kind of way!). I highly recommend this vehicle to those who need ample room, luxury, and at a decent price. This thing rivals supposed luxury cars on the highway. What I especially liked was the auto rear differential locks. Colorado snows hefty and when you stop, well 92% you'll end up stuck. The rear automatically stops power to the wheel that slips and converts it to the wheel that grips. What's also nifty is the ONSTAR which helps me find the nearest Dairy Queen. Only problem is unlike conventional GPS, you have to pay for the services. Good thing the first year is free, every year after that is $199. This vehicle always makes you feel in &quot;command&quot;. Like you're guiding a huge tank and everybody is looking with amazement. Again this vehicle in my book is highly recommended.<br><br>
