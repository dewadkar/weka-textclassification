            I bought a brand new Prizm (used to be GEO Prizm) in 1990.  When I took the car for a test drive, I made sure to roll down the windows, open the trunk and hood, blow the horn and kick the tires.  The front passenger window rolled down, but wouldn't roll back up.  I showed the salesperson (it's politically incorrect to call her a saleswoman), and she promised to have the window assembly replaced.  After a lot of thought and some hesitation, I decided to buy the car (actually, my boyfriend at the time really liked it...).

I picked up my &quot;beautiful&quot; new Prizm and started to drive home.  I hit a pothole and, to my surprise, the front passenger window fell out and smashed in the road!!!  That was the beginning of the nightmare otherwise known as GEO Prizm.

Within two months the car was back in the dealership to have the digital clock/radio/cassette player replaced.  It seems that the computer chip that controlled it was defective, and it caused the radio to jump and the clock to spin at will.  It drove me nuts.

Six months after I bought that blue piece of junk, two of the interior door handles had broken in half.  Both rear windows were frozen in place because they had come off their runners and stuck.  I was quickly becoming a fixture in the dealership's waiting room while my car was being serviced.

I ended up filing a Lemon Law claim against GM for this tin can with a motor, but lost because they said I needed FOUR repairs on the same item within six months for it to qualify.  I ditched the car.

Did I mention that I ditched the boyfriend, too?<br><br>
