            The Ram Charger was around long before they called them SUVs.  And many people don't know that this full sized monster is still rolling off the line in Mexico. (Search the web for pictures of the new full sized Ram Charger sold in  Mexico.)  However they stopped selling them in the U.S. in 1994.  Believe me, this truck (and it is a truck) has a mythical quality about it.

Most people who drive Ram Chargers didn't end up with them by accident.  Usually they looked long and hard for one.  Check your want adds...it's unusual to see more than three or four for sale at any given time.  You won't see any yuppies driving one with a "Baby on Board" sticker on back.   In fact, I suspect that most Ram Chargers won't run properly unless there is an empty beer can or two rolling around in the cargo area. (Speaking of the cargo area...your can hold a football game back there!) You will never see one with 4 doors. This is not a "panty waist" overgrown station wagon like most of the current SUVs.  Both two wheel and four-wheel models were sold.  No attempt was ever made by Dodge (and Plymouth in the case of the Trail Duster) to take the "truck" out of the vehicle.  It is a truck. It rides like a truck and handles like a truck.  It performs like a truck and works like a truck.  If you don't want a truck...look elsewhere.

All the following statements are based on a used vehicle that has been normally maintained.  If it was abused you should know what to expect and this will be obvious to any experienced used truck buyer.

 The 318 CU engine probably gets worse gas mileage than the 360 in an older vehicle like this due to the weight it has to pull.  I base this statement on talks I have had with other "charger" owners.  Twelve miles to the gallon is the average city mileage for the unaltered 318 with over 100,000 miles on it.  Highway mileage goes up slightly to 15-16 MPG range.  The engine is extremely dependable.  With normal maintenance breakdowns and repairs are far and few between.  About the only time I have to have mine repaired is when I break something rather than the truck itself breaking.  The most common repairs I hear other "charger" owner's mention (including myself) are the power window motors and speed sensors for the speed odometer.  The rear hatch "shocks" have to be replace every few years as the hatch itself weights a ton and tends to wear them down.  My particular "charger" does not eat tires and has never needed an alignment since I have owned it!  The Captains chairs have "arms" and the back seat can be folded up to gain more cargo space.  Entry to back seat is from passenger side only. 

One problem to expect besides the ones I mention above is the paint.  If not garaged the hood and other areas will oxidize quickly.  Just take a look at the next one you see at a traffic light to see what I mean.  If the hood isn't oxidized then it has probably been repainted.  Don't let this bother you.  Like "age wrinkles", the oxidation just builds character for the truck.

This truck is heavy sheet metal.  From experience I can tell you it can take a pounding.  A co-worker once backed his Nissan Path Finder into my Ram Charger by accident.  Damage to the PathFinder was several thousand dollars.  After I flicked the red Nissan paint off my bumper I was back in business.  A few years ago I watched a Volvo making a left turn into the wrong lane hit a Ram Charger head on.  Air bags and injured yuppies everywhere!  The Volvo was crumpled like a lite beer can.  After The Volvo injured had left for the hospital and the Volvo had been towed away I pointed out to the Ram Charger owner (a man in his 60s) that it had dented his bumper.  "No",  he said, "that was already there...I hit my tractor with it a few years back".

Search the web for Ram Charger Discussion Groups and Web pages.  There is a devoted following of this truck and the reasons are many.  Like the Harley Davidson saying goes...if you have to ask...you wouldn't understand.  So if you have $3000 to $5000 to spend on a used Truck, take your time and find the right one.  Invest in a couple CB antennas, a 30 watt export CB, some all terrain tires,  a brush guard, tinted windows, driving lights, and a slight "lift" for the truck.  All your investment will be paid off the first time you pull up beside one of those new over grown station wagons they call SUVs and simply smile at the other driver as if you are trying to make up your mind what to do with him............
