            I have owned my Vivitar 2700 for 19 months and had very little problems
with it. True, it does eat standard batteries quickly, but I went to the rechargeable type and can get 50-80 standard pics from one set. I usually carry two extra sets for it very easy to change them and I've not had any
problems with the battery door at all. The camera surely doesn't compare with the $400.00 models, but I consistenly get a fair quality photo and  this is what I purchased the camera for. By the way, this model was purchased at Wal-mart and the price was well below $200.00<br><br>
