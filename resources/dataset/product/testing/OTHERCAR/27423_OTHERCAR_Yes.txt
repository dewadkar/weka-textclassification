            I bought a Neon in 1995 to make my 135 mile daily round-trip commute.  After test driving other small cars of that time, I knew that the Neon was going to be the one I ended up purchasing.  Other small cars did not seem to have near as much pep as the Neon, and when commuting both over long stretches of highway and over mountains, power was something I felt was important.  In addition, the Neon just seemed to be a very comfortable car (I purchased the Highline Sport model, 4-door, all options except cruise control).  After making that commute for 3 years and putting almost 100,000 miles on the car (and in the process, hitting one deer with the car too) it is still running like a top.  My commute is much shorter now (20 miles round trip), but I still enjoy driving the Neon.  I have a growing family, and I'm in the tough position of having to decide if the Neon is still a good fit for me and my family.  I really hate to get rid of the car because it has been so reliable and fun to drive, but it may be time to get something a little bit bigger.

Overall?  I'd never hesitate to recommend a Neon to someone who needs a reliable and safe small car.  The collision with the deer crumpled the front driver side fender and part of the hood, but I suffered no injury - and the air bag did NOT activate, nor should it have since impact was at only one point on the fender.  I never had the car out of service for unexpected maintenance.  It drove well in the snow, too.  (This is as much a function of tires as anything else, though.)

The only things I do *not* like about the Neon are the small gas tank (11.5 gallons), the headlights, and the frameless front windows.  I've had on-going problems with getting the driver side window to be adjusted exactly right for a good fit with the top of the door frame.  And my previous commuter car (1987 Dodge Omni) had a 13.5 gallon tank, which would give me the opportunity to make one more one-way trip before having to fill the tank.  As for the headlights - they are indeed weak.  I've read reviews bemoaning them, and I do have to say that Dodge really shortchanged Neon owners with this lighting system.  Having the Sport model, I'm happy that I at least have the driving lights to augment the headlights - and I use them.  I'm currently waiting for PIAA to make replacement H-7 bulbs to see if that makes a difference.

The only unexpected problem I encountered had nothing to do with the car mechanically.  The light in the radio went out and Dodge refused to cover it under warranty, saying the light was &quot;normal wear and tear&quot;.  So I simply ended up buying a new radio that I really wanted instead of paying them the estimated $100 to fix the problem.  However, I must say that the stock radio I had did NOT have any shortcomings as to receptions or power.  I was overall pleased with the stock radio.

The split folding rear seats really add to the versatility of the car.  During our basement remodelling project last year, I was able to go to the hardware store and purchase molding, pipe, and other long or oversized items and have them fit in the car with no problem.  There's no way I would have been able to fit those items in our larger Taurus.

I've read occasional posts from people who have had problems with their Neon, and one friend who bought a Neon also had a small problem with his.  I feel that these were &quot;flies in the ointment&quot;, as the car has been fun to drive and it met all of my expectations.  If you need a commuting car, or even just a drive around town car that's small but not TOO small, and with power to spare - then the Neon is still my #1 choice.<br><br>
