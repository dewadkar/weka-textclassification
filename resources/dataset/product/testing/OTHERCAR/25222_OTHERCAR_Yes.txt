            I bought a Dodge 2500 4x4 with the V10 engine in June 2000. It came with the SLT package and the long bed. The SLT package gave me everything I ever needed in a car plus more. I sold the car after one month, in July 2000. Here is why !

<b>Driveability</b>
I was pleased with the ride in this Dodge. For a truck this size and weight and with 4 wheel drive, the ride is pretty smooth and acceptable even on Oklahoma roads, which are probably the worst in the United States.
The 4x4 version is huge. I never had any problems getting around corners or into small parking spots, though. I never had the feeling that I would tip over in fast corners and curves, either. The suspension is stiff enough to keep the vehicle pretty straight. On my way to work, I have several curves that I used to take at 65 mph without problems in the Dodge. When I drive a Chevy Blazer through those curves at the same speed, it fells quite uncomfortable and the car leans way over. (Both cars are not lifted or lowered).
The acceleration in the Dodge is very smooth. I once had a little race with a new Mustang V-6 and neither one was faster up to about 70mph (I did not want to risk my license !). I consider this good acceleration, keeping in mind that the Mustang probably weighs one third of what the Dodge weighs.
When you have the cruise control on, the truck keeps its speed precisely and rarely ever shifts, which is probably due to the enormous torque. The rpm usually sits at around 1700 at 60 mph.

<b>Safety</b>
The Dodge 2500 4x4 is one of the highest truck build. You look down onto the roof of most other trucks and SUV's and even Suburbans seem somewhat small when you stand next to them. Sitting up there gives you a great overview, and you usually know what's going on several cars in front of you.
Should a regular passenger car hit you, it will probably get stuck underneath you. The Dodge weighs approximately four tons. Most passenger cars weigh about 1.5 tons. Imagine a soccer ball hitting a bowling ball and you know why you feel safe in the Dodge.
My truck also came with anti-lock brakes and driver side airbag.

<b>Economy</b>
This is why I sold this truck. I could not manage getting more that 10 mpg. I tried everything- driving at constant speeds, having the tailgate down, using premium gasoline, putting in a new air filter, holding my breath. It just wouldn't do it.
I only had one little mechanical problem. The front U-joints were about to go out. U-joints for this truck cost about $400 a side. That's when I decided to get rid of it. I looked at prices for other parts and they are way up there.  I did not want to risk spending half my income on parts.

<b>The big pluses</b>
This car really is a head turner. It's just too big not to be noticed. I have honestly never had a car that would draw that much attention, and I have had quite a number of cars. Especially the V10-sticker on the side motivated people at gas stations to ask me about the car. I had plenty of time to talk since it took a while to fill up the 33 gallon tank.
It really seems like you can pull anything with this car and not even know it. If you ant to pull your 30 ft. 5th wheel and take your yacht with you, go ahead and get the Dodge 2500 V10. If you have enough money for these kind of toys, you should be okay with the gas mileage and costs of parts.

<b>Summary</b>
The Dodge 2500 is a safe and nice looking truck that can really be used for what a truck is meant to be used for. The gas mileage sucks and parts are expensive. Engine and drive train are supposed to be very reliable, I have heard of people having over 400k miles on their V10's without any troubles ever.
I will go back to a Jeep Wrangler. I have had 3 before and know how to work on them. I don't even want to get under the hood of a newer Dodge truck with the abundance of hoses and wires, I may fall in and get lost !
