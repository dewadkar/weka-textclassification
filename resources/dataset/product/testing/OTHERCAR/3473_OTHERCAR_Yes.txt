            The new 2000 Pontiac Bonneville is an absolute dream of an automobile! It is pure driving luxury. For a lot less money than say....Mercedes, Lexus, Jaguar, Infiniti, etc. I mean, for less money and hassle ( do you know how hard it is to find a Jag dealer ? ) you can still receive  the driving satisfaction you are looking for.
This car is beautiful! Completely redesigned for 2000. The exterior is sleek and well defined. The interior is unbelievable! You will love the design of the interior. Everything is very &quot;driver-friendly&quot;.
The engine has a lot of &quot;pep&quot;. That you will not be disappointed with either. Even though the car looks a little smaller than previous years it is just an optical illusion! There is plenty of room in this baby! The is plenty of trunk space also. The ride is smooth and easy to handle. It glides along like a dream. You will think you are riding on a cloud.
