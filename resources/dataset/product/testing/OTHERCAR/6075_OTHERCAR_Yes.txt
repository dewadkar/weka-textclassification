            Traded in my '97 E420 for the new E320 with 4 wheel drive. Last winter's snow storms really got to me and, fortunately, this great car comes with 4 WD. I frankly cannot tell the difference between the 8 cylinder 420 and the 6 cylinder 320..same pick up and acceleration as far as I'm concerned...faster than I'll ever need. In fact, the E420 is only about a second faster from zero to 60. Why pay $5000 for one second? I read that the 4WD adds only 200 lbs. to the weight. I understand that the 2002 model will undergo some styling changes, but if you like the way it looks now, why wait? Looks great and drives great.
