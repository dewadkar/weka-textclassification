            As soon as the new Maxima came out in 2000, I absolutely had to have one. Still a poor college student, I was forced to wait. But in 2001 I finally bought a Maxima GXE, and it's everything I ever wanted in a car.

First, there's tremendous performance. The 2001 Maxima comes standard with a 222hp V6 DOHC engine. That means the car can really get up and go. The Maxima is capable of going from 0-60 in about 6 seconds. And not only is the engine powerful, it's also high quality. In 2001 Ward's Auto World, the reigning engine authority, put the Maxima's engine in its '10 Best' list for the seventh consecutive year, a new record. Ward's said, "There isn't a better V6 in all of automobiledom - regardless of price."

Second, and equally important, is handling. Not only does the Maxima have power, but you can really harness it. The car handles like a beauty. The cornering, braking, etc. is very responsive and makes the car easy to drive.

Third is the aura of luxury. The car looks and feels like luxury car. It has a sporty/classy look on the outside, and the interior is really nice. Many cars, even some of Nissan's other models, have a sort of "cheap" feel to the interior. The Maxima, however, feels very plush, even at the most basic trim level. 

Finally, there are a lot of smaller features on the car. The dashboard consoles are very well designed and laid out, making them easy to use. There are stereo and cruise controls right on the steering wheel though, so you may never need to touch the console! The rear seats fold down to increase the trunk space, which came in handy when I brought a Christmas tree home. The Maxima offers keyless entry and has a computer chip in the key so the car won't start without it. Between the driver and passenger seats is an adjustable armrest with a lot of storage space inside (it's great for storing CDs). Even the beverage holder between the seats is "adjustable" so it can handle unusually large (e.g. 1 liter bottles) beverages. The driver's window has one-touch up/down. The rearview mirror has an auto-dimmer, which is very nice when you're driving at night.

I considered other makes/models in this class, including the Camry, Accord, Taurus, Passat, and Impala. Although all are lower priced (except maybe the Passat), not one of them had the performance and style of the Maxima, in my opinion.

You can read reviews about this car on a number of automotive-type websites. The reviews usually include a phrase about how much fun the car was to drive or how they had to pry the keys out of the test driver's hands. It's also a perennial winner in terms of roominess for its class.

If you're considering a sedan, you'd be well served to take a look at the Maxima. If the car is just for a driver (i.e. not a family-hauler) I don't think you'll find a more driver-centric car in this class.
