            I purchased a 1991 Acclaim in 1997, it had 100,000 miles when I purchased it.
I have had nothing but problems with this car, and by talking to several mechanics, I am not alone.

This car is infamous for two problems.  The first, the poor paint job.  Almost every Acclaim I see on the road looks just like mine.  The paint is peeling.  This usually starts on the roof of the car and spreads from there.  I contacted the manufacturer and asked them about it, seeing if they would help me fix the problem since it appears to be on almost every car I have seen.  They said they have not had any reported problems with it and were not willing to assist me in fixing the peeling paint.  Althought I didn't really expect them to help, I'm surprised they denied the problem existed.  I was sure there must have been a recall on the car, but no such luck.

Also, since I have owned it, I have been through my share of engine problems.

The car stalls (while driving) somewhat frequently.  Not frequently enough, however, to take the car in and get it checked since it often doesn't stall while they are looking at it, but often enough to be a rather huge pain.

I have replaced the entire radiator twice, the thermostat twice, and this is the third time the head gasket has caused me to almost completely replace the engine.
