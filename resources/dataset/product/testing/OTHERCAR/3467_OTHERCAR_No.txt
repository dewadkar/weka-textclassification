            My 98 Catera is in a shop a lot and this time I got a 2000 Bonneville as a loaner for a few days.

I was unimpressed with the car overall.
It had cloth seats so that probably did not help.

It badly needs radio controls on the wheel since you have to reach over while driving which is a distraction.

The horn cannot be reached by most thumbs (I'm 6'1&quot; and have average sized hands for my height) - there should be buttons also available to make it easier to honk quickly.

The red backlighting was cool on the dash and the driver's seat could go really far back - in fact this was one of the few cars where i did not go back all the way in the seat!

Despite having 6-way power seats, the tilting of the seat back was manual which was very strange.

The headrests are very badly designed - you can't really use them due to the thick padding of the backrest. They should be able to tilt forward to support your neck.

The height of the shifter should be increased slightly to allow you to rest your hand on it while switching channels.

I was almost on empty but did not see any kind of low fuel light - i happened to notice the gauge much later.

The wheel grip is nice and thick and the blind spots around the car are much smaller than a Catera.

While cruising on the highway I could go 70 - 80 mph with no problems but the engine noise is louder than a Catera's.

An automatic dimming rear view mirror would be another nice option to have (like the Catera).

I personally don't think this is good value for money (my 98 Catera cost $20 k used with 18 k miles). This one had only 30 miles on it when I got it.

The trunk was the best part - large, roomy, and light - it pops open completely which is very handy if you are carrying bags, etc. ALL car trunks should be designed to open like this.

The range for the keyless entry was really good - about 2-3 times the distance for the Catera and the panic button on the remote is excellent for locating the car in large parking lots.
