            1996 Toyota Corolla, which is the DX version that I had purchased used as a second car which was needed very badly.

Original miles were 55,000 back in 1999 w/4 185/65/14 Kumo All Season Tires and currently it has over 103,000 miles.

Between 55,000 to 90,000 I had only changed the oil every 3,000 miles, had the car tuned up using Bosch Platinum Spark Plugs and replaced the timing belt and the transmission oil and gasket seal.

It runs so well and very nimble it's hard to get the car away from my wife who drives it daily.

On the highway the 4 speed overdrive auto transmission shifts smoothly with the 16 value 4 w/ 1.8 fuel ejection engine. While on the highway if you're on a hill and you need to speed up the low end torque is there to give you more power quickly. All you have to do is just push down on the gas pedal and she'll take you where you want.

Handling is a very strong point here with all power steering, front power disc w/ rear drum brakes that stop sharp.

Power Windows w/power locks, excellent fully logic stereo cassette 4 speaker radio w/deep bass when you need it.

Basically the car is great, yet small in the rear seats when you push the front seats all the way back for your legs, and the steering column can tilt up and down.

What I have notice that at 3,000 miles you better get an oil change.

Overhaul for a used car itï¿½s great!
