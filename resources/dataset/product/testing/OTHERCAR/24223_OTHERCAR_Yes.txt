            magnum V8. cruise, tilt, tinted side windows, power locks and windows, sliding rear window, side vent windows, towing package, and lots of miles (160000) I have had my truck for about 4 yrs now and it has been kinda bitter sweet. The first trouble was the radiator. It blew for no reason other than it was cheap....I replaced it with a heavy duty aftermarket radiator. Then the truck stopped shifting into overdrive. $3000 later I have a rebuilt tranny. Not happy about any of that, but, I do love the Dakota. It has a lot of power with the V8....I can pull just about anything. It is just the right size for parking in the city parking ramps ( had a full size pickup and found it very hard to fit in the parking ramps ). I really like the fact that I can fit most of my gear in the cab to keep it safe while on trips. I have really abused this truck, on and off road. 
Due to the off road use I have had to replace the shocks. I have never had a problem with the 4 wheel drive...always shifts in and out of 4 wheel trouble free. Great in the snow. Very comfortable on long trips...buckets in the front and a split bench in the rear. I have a topper I use in the winter but not in the summer. It does seem to like gas...alot. I average about 11mpg. The truck has always started,even in the -30F winters. Even with 160K on it, it starts on the first try ever time and still has power. The truck has not rusted at all...none....we get a lot of salt and sand dumped on the roads in this part of the counrty. My Uncle owned the truck before me and he claims to have had no problems ever. I am a bit surprized that all of the "power accessories" still work (locks and windows). Overall I would buy another Dakota. 
Update 8/24/01: Now more bitter than sweet. I went out of town this last weekend. Put my dual sport bike in the back and headed out of town. Hit heavy rain and was in it for hours. Stopped for gas and when ready to move on the Dakota would not turn over...it was about dark-O-clock and pouring rain. Had to leave the truck behind and finish my travels on the bike (thank God I had the bike with). The next morning I went back and checked out the truck. Could not figure out the problem...had plenty of battery power but would not turn over. Had it towed one block to the shop for $45. He claims to have found the starter bad and the 30 amp fuse for the air conditioner pump blown and the bearings for the pulley on the end of the AC pump. He could not get the parts needed for the pulley bearing problem. He did replace the starter and the fuse. $337 later I was on my way home with a very loud pulley bearing and only 200 miles to go. When I got home I decided to pull out the 30 amp fuse he replaced, and then tried to start the truck. Hmmmmm same exact problem...wouldn't turn over. So, I think I bought a starter that I did not need. So the Truck is at home and has started to leak oil. This all leaves me a bit bitter....I am sure that the pulley bearing is going to cost plenty and then I can spend more for the oil leak. I am going to start using it for a piggy bank since it likes to have money put in it so much. I do have over 160000 on it so.....maybe time to upgrade.
