            Toyota seems to be on a role with great cars and trucks.  Toyota usually doesn't make mistakes when it comes to designing and selling cars and trucks.
I have a Toyota Camry and love it to death.  My brother drives a Toyota 4-Runner and has seen no problems with it and my dad and boyfriend drive Toyota Tundras.
I thought my car was great, until I just sat in the Tundra.  
First of all the seats are great.  Going on a long road trip? Well these seats are like bed comfortable.  No problems snoozing a bit.  
There are different types of Tundras you can get.  They offer regular and extended cab models.  
It has high quality plastic that adorns the dashboard and door panels-kind of like being inside the Lexus ES300.  The radio and climate controls are easy accessible and well positioned.
The radio has large buttons and the climate controls have knobs that turn very smoothly.  
The Toyota Tundra feels more like riding in a sudan.  The ride is really smooth and sometimes you forget that you are in a truck.  It is great.  
There is a back seat, which is kind of tight, but manageable.  For some one who is big, riding back in the back wouldn't be too comfortable for a long amount of time.  
Getting in and out of the truck is very easy. It has four doors for the convience of the person in the back seat.  No more having to pull the front seat down.  
Toyota has finally put out a pick up truck with power that everyone loves.  I would definatly recommend a Toyota Tundra for anyone and everyone who wants a new pick up truck.
