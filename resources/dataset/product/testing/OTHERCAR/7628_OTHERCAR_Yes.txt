            If you ever had an older SUV, and then drive this one, you will immediately notice the difference in the ride.  It is much smoother, like a car.  The jiggle and bounce are gone.
Maintenance is a dream.  With over 62,000 miles, I am just now looking to buy new tires, and am looking to get a brake job.
4 wheel drive is not a necessity, and in fact impeeds towing capacity, but even on the 4wd, you can easily tow a heavy trailer up steep hills without a lot of strain on the engine.
The interior is roomy, without overly extending the outside dimensions of the vehicle.  4 adults fit comfortably and there is plenty of room in the back to stow luggage or a couple ice chests.  The back seat has a 60/40 split so one adult can sit comfortably while carrying around an oversize package.
This is a great vehicle to haul things around, be it people or objects.  This has been both a work and a family vehicle and it has been useful with both.  A family with one or two children would find this very suitable.  Anyone who likes to ride a little higher up to get a better view would also find this the right vehicle for him or her.  But a person who likes to take corners at high speeds should shy away..this is not the vehicle for them.  Due to the higher center of gravity, there is the real potential for the vehicle to go up on two wheels or careen out of control.

Compared to the Jeep Cherokee, the Jimmy has a lot more leg room in the back seat.  This may be consideration for those with growing children, or those looking to drive around other adults fairly often.  The Jimmy is also easier to climb in and out of.  
The Jimmy is also superior to the Ford Explorer in terms of interior roominess and just plain good looks.

With all the possible bells and whistles, minus the leather interior, the new 1996 Jimmy listed at over $28,000.  This is pricey, but you are getting a lot of vehicle for the money.  And 1995-1996 was right around the time when SUVs were changing focus from utilitarian vehicles and starting to look towards more of the luxury end.<br><br>
