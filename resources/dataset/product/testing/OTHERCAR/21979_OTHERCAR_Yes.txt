                <b>W</b>hen Toyota set out to build one of the world's best luxury cars at an affordable price the effort was, to say the least, intense. Incredibly in less than 15 years the 2000 Lexus LS 400 has come extremely close to defeating all of its established rivals that are in the same price range and even above in many cases.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

    <b>Q</b>uiet and very peaceful, the LS 400, for the 2000 model year is almost fully automatic. The smooth shifting 5-speed automatic transmission is always in the right gear, while high speed refinement and stability couldn't be topped. 

<b>Acceleration</b> with 290 horses on board is excellent, even though this car weighs over 3,000 lbs, it still has the get-up and go normally associated with sports cars.  Braking, and handling are almost impossible to find fault with, but picky drivers may criticize the LS 400's lack of involvement because of the car's dynamics and the remote feel to the power-assisted steering.

    <b>T</b>he Ls400 is a true Japanese wonder car. The Lexus DOHC V8 can claim to be one of the finest V8 engines ever built. The block and heads are all of alloy, and there are four camshafts opening four valves per cylinder. This V8 is also very smooth, thanks to the four balanced shafts which minimize vibration. Since 1998 the Ls400's engine has had variable valve timing (VVT) which made the maximum power output of 290 HP be reached at a higher 6,000 RPM. Torque is greater than before 1998, 300 lb-ft which occurs at a relatively low 4,000 RPM, this helps hill climbing greatly!

   Obviously Lexus refused to make any compromises with the LS 400. The car has the type of <b>suspension</b> typically found in more exotic cars, with double wishbones all around. The Ls400 has huge ABS assisted vented disc brakes, and power assisted rack and pinion steering. Like I said before, this Mother of Japanese Luxury imports comes with an ultra smooth 5-speed automatic, with 'intelligence'.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

   The <b>interior</b> of the Lexus LS 400 is Lexus material, which means it's darn near perfect. Lexus has, for many years now, set a standard for Luxury cars. Rich leather, supportive; comfortable seats, thick leather wrapped steering wheel, and a special Lexus on-board navigator uses information from GPS (global positioning Satellites), together with dead rekoning, and county maps on CD rom, to guide the driver. The Lexus, while not as big as a Lincoln Town Car, has tons of room. This car is large enough for a 8 ft driver to drive in comfort for days, not to mention averaged sized drivers.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

   The <b>exterior</b> is nothing to write home about, and can be considered Lexus's only downfall for this car. The style was revised in 1996, which  made it a little more bold, but all-in-all the Lexus LS 400 is a relation of Mrs. Plain Jane. The rims for 2000 are all plain as well, so if you are looking for this car to stand out, ditch the factory rims for another set.

    The value of the LS400 is excellent. Today, LS400's represent some of the best luxury car values on the used market. Second-hand '2000 Ls400s can be found for around  $40,000 (brand new these cars were around 54,000.) These second hand Lexus's hold their value, and are an excellent buy.    

   The Ls400 has always been a reliable automobile, a check from <b>Consumer Reports.org</b> will give you all the info on reliability you need on the '2000 model.
