              I am very pleased with my 98 Mazda B3000.  Bought to replace a totalled B2300, I am very impressed at how Mazda has learned from mistakes and customer input.  I loved my old truck; small and sleek, yet still had the rugged truck feel to it.  This new one, however, was a dream to drive.

  Those of you familiar with the '95-'97 B-series probably know their main faults:  The plastic panel dealy on the bottom side of the seats usually falls off, the electrical system is notoriously unstable when splashing through water, and the seat belts are really slack, often catching in the door if you're not careful.  Well, the '98 version solves two of the three here (Sorry if these all seem cosmetic, engine/performance wise I was completely happy with my old truck).  The plastic dealy is now gone, replaced with a cloth tab (have no clue what it's for, but it's not gonna break off).  Also, the electrical system performed quite happily after serious splashing.  The belts, however, are still very slack, and hopefully Mazda has addressed this.

  Performancewise, this truck was a dream;  the old B2300 was a bit lacking in the power department, especially on uphills.  the B3000 has power to spare, always responsive to acceleration.  And, Mazda's stiffened the body more than 350%, making for turns that feel really tight, and total responsiveness.  The SE Cab Plus version that I have also adds cool new amenities in back; two more cup holders, a utility tray, and a privacy liner that you can drag over your stuff to cover it up!

  The B-series trucks are functionally identical to their cousin, the Ford Rangers...in fact, Ford makes all B-Series trucks.  Aesthetically, I much prefer the Mazda styling, and these trucks haven't given me any problems at all.  Muchly recommended!<br><br>
