             Are you kidding?  This car has the power to outrun a sports car and it a four dour sedan.  Just hearing that one has to think of the capabilities of this car. My family has had 3 maximas (87' 95' 99') and we have been very happy with their performance.  I think that we will have at least 2 more maximas in our stay in CT, and I am very excited to get another.
 There is absolutely nothing to hate and everything to love about this car.  It comes with great features such as a bose stereo, sunroof, leather seats and heated seats.  To drive this car is one of the best experiences I have had so far.  Pressing that paddle and hearing that engine is just something everyone has to hear.
 Everyone who is looking for a nice luxury car with the capabilities of it being a racing car, The 99' Maxima GLE is a great but and I recommend it to all.
