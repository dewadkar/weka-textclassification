            My husband and I own a 98 Mercury Tracer four door sedan.  We bought it new almost two years ago. We were in dire need of a new car and it absolutely had to be reliable.  We also were on a budget, so we could not afford anything over about $15,000.  The Tracer was one of the first cars we looked at and we liked it right away.  We actually ended up using it as a comparison when looking at other cars.  We decided the Tracer was our best option for the price, performance, and reliability.  We have been very happy with it.  We have had no problems at all with our Tracer.  We have found it to be very reliable, as we have had unreliable cars in the past.  We have the utmost confidence in it.  We do not hesitate to travel long distances.  

Even though it is a small car, the Tracer does still have a suitable amount of storage area in the trunk.  I also like being able to access the trunk through the rear seat from either side.  

I have found this car to be fun to drive as well.  It may not be a &quot;sports&quot; car, but it does have some &quot;get-up-and-go&quot;! We chose red as our color, so I get to feel a little like I am driving a sporty car.  

I have also been very impressed with the gas mileage our Tracer gets.  We get about 27 mpg in normal driving, and about 36 mpg on the interstate. 
 
The Mercury Tracer is a good choice for someone needing a good car, but who is also on a budget.
