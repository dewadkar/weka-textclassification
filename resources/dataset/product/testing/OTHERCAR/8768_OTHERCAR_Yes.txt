            We purchased the <b>2001 Toyota Echo</b> for a family car back in 2001, we haven't had any problems with it.
Other than the fuel light being easy to miss, the rest of the car is Fantastic!!!
I have 2 kids the 2 car-seats fit perfectly in the back seat and still have room for a 3rd person. Its more than spacious for a sub compact car. The leg room is actually more in the echo than the corolla, which we initially were going to purchase. 
The speedometer and all being in the center didn't take more than a day to get used to. You'd never realize how much you try to look through/over your steering wheel to see it in other cars, until you drive this one. It's in plain view and allows you to keep more of your attention on the road.
If your like us, you'll love the compartments. There are side compartments on either front door, magazine type holders on the backs of the front seats, a slide tray under the front passenger seat, a perfect compartment for sunglasses on the front passenger dash, with the large glove compartment below it. As well as CD/tape holders on either side of the stereo. And under the steering wheel another little open compartment. Lastly the little compartments on the door handles. 
Tether anchors for car-seats are easily accessible just behind the back seats.
Being a subcompact car parking in the city is a breeze, it opens up a world of spots that larger cars cannot fit into.
I have full trust in this car. Handles well. Both my husband and I feel comfortable in it *he's a big man, and I am of petite form so to find a car that suits both of us as well as practical for kids was/is difficult.
Since we bought the car 16 months ago 4 of my family members have purchased the same car. 
Its a must see when car shopping!!!!!
Many people look for cars that do well on gas, can't blame anyone with today's gas prices. Gas is of no issue when driving this car. I wish I could give estimates of gas mileage, but it takes so long to empty out the tank I usually forget to record my mileage. We do a mix of city and highway driving and It's equally superb on gas for both. Less than 20 bucks to fill the tank in NYC and I end up getting gas approx every 2 weeks. Driving to and from work daily with small weekend trips. With the money I have saved in gas thus far I can probably purchase another echo.

 This Car is just plain out fantastic!!!!! As they say on the old children's' show <i>Reading Rainbow</i>  "but you don't have to take my word for it"
