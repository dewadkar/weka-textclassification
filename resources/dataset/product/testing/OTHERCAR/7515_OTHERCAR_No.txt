            We started shopping for a car a few months ago, and had finally after many test drives decided on the 2000 Dodge Stratus, fully loaded, and we nearly ready to buy the car.  I am thankful now we got the chance to rent a Stratus on a business trip before we put our money down.

We prepared to leave in a brand new Stratus, had less than 2,500 miles on the car when we picked it up from Enterprise car rentals.  The first thing we noticed about the car is that it does not steer well at higher speeds.  To me it felt like I had to really put effort into high way driving, as it did not glide like my other cars have in the past.  

I could have dealt with that, had I not found that the light inside does NOT turn off like it should when you exit the car over half the time.  The first time the battery sent dead, we called Enterprise and they got us jumped and we blamed ourselves for accidentally leaving it on...

We were good to go until the return trip home.  We stopped for dinner, and the battery went dead while we were inside.  In less than 2 hours the interior light wore the battery down..  We felt it had to be a bad battery, but Enterprise assured us later on it was NOT the battery but the car.

Enterprise refunded our money due to the small problems we had with the car, locks freezing, headlights blinking, and more.  This is not the car for us, we are again looking for a car to suit us.<br><br>
