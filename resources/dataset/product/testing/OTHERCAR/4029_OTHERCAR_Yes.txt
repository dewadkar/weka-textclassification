            Chevy Tahoe is the best vehicle on the road.  I love my 1993 Tahoe that I bought used.  I can haul any thing from building supplies to 6 kids.  I feel safe and secure because i know that the is quality workmanship.  I feel safe when the roads are bad, I live in Pennsylvania and the winters are hard.  I know when I turn on my 4-wheel drive that I can go anywhere I want.  I can't think of a single thing that I hate about the chevy tahoe.  to drive a Chevy Tahoe is a great experience and I feel even if I do have a accident that I will walk away from it because of the quality workman ship that Chevy is know for and the metal that is involved in building a tahoe, I feel safe a secure in any situation.  I feel everyone should own a Tahoe and can't think of a single person that should not.  I have ridden in many Ford Blazers or Broncos whatever you want to call them and Ford just doesn't have the reputation that chevy has when it comes to building a 4-wheel drive vehicle and the resale value of a Chevy is much higher than any other product on the market.<br><br>
