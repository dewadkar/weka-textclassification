                  I came across the Kodak dc-200 while doing some online comparison shopping for digital camera's.  At first the price seemed a little steep but I had heard some good things about Kodak digital cameras so I decided to buy it.  

     I primarily wanted a digital camera in order to avoid paying those outrageous fee for film development.  I could not be any happier with the purchase of this camera, it captures clear pictures and is very easy to use.

     The camera came along with:

1.  serial cable to upload the images directly onto your computer.
2.  A T.V. cable to view your pictures on a television without uploading onto your computer (this is perfect for slide shows)
3.  Lens cap ( the lens cap is fairly easy to lose because of it's size and the way it mounts onto the lens)
4.  Kodak digital science picture easy software (very easy to use)
5.  4 mb digital memory card which can hold up to 60 pictures of the lowest quality (you can also buy memory cards that hold many more pictures)

     This camera is very easy to use; it utilizes a menu system which allows the user to select many different camera functions.  It is basically a matter of picking the size and resolution of the pictures you would like to take. After selecting that, you simply point and shoot. 

     The only drawback of this camera and most likely all digital cameras with a built in LCD display is that is uses up batteries fairly quickly.  However I have found a way to prolong the life of the batteries when using this camera.  The LCD display uses most of the battery power, so in order to conserve energy simply keep it off while in the capture mode. 

     If you are worried about the battery usage of this camera you may want to  purchase an optional Kodak AC adapter which is specifically designed for this camera. <b>NOTE:</b> do not attempt to use any other AC adapter, I know it is tempting but doing so will void your warranty and may damage your $300 camera.

     I have also found shareware software for the dc-200 which allows you to use the camera as a web cam.  This makes the Kodak dc-200 even better.

     I would recommend the Kodak dc-200 for anyone looking for a good, high quality digital camera.
