            After exhaustive research, I narrowed my choice down to the Chrysler 300M, the Volvo S70, and the Saab 9-5 SE.  Obviously based on this review, I chose the Saab 9-5.  The more I drive this car, the more reassured I am that I made the correct choice.

Being a salesman who drives 35,000 to 50,000 miles per year, I felt the number one requirement for my vehicle must be longevity.  Since the industry that I work in typically uses a car allowance plus mileage for reimbursement, I needed a car that would provide a return on my investment.  The Swedes delivered this once before, I bet they can deliver it again.  Since General Motors purchased Saab, they have also taken on a more main stream design.  The purists will dislike this, but the average non-cultist like myself, appreciates it.

My last car was a 1989 Volvo 740 Turbo.  This car was a good balance of comfort and performance.  I got 24 mpg on the highway.  It was stable, comfortable and fun.  I drove it 297,000 miles and it lost no oil between changes and cost me only $ 1,000 per year to own.  Since I drove 50,000 miles per year, this included a set of tires.  It had no rust and the original shocks on it when I sold it.  A great car.

The question then begs to be asked .... why didn't I buy another Volvo.  From 1989 to 1999 something happened to Volvo.  They changed engine platforms.  I feel like the new S70 series requires that you put your foot to the floor to get the car moving.  I felt as if I was torturing the car to get it up to 60 mph.  

Enter the Saab 9-5.  This is as spirited of a car as it gets.  The 9-5 reaches maximum torque of +/- 208 ft. lbs. at just 1800 rpm!  You can pull out into traffic and with very little foot action, and maximum 2800 rpm, get the car up and going.  Plus, a huge cost benefit, I get 35 mpg on the highway driving 70 mph.

The comfort factor is high.  The seats are well formed and with drivers side memory, I can program three different positions and vary my seating positions for those long drives.  Or, vary them based on my mood.  One is a more aggressive seating position than the other two.  All seats are heated, to warm the muscles on long drives, or to warm the buns on cold mornings.  My kids refer to the heated seats as &quot;bun warmers&quot;.  Both front and back seats are heated.  The front seats are also ventilated for those warm summer days.

One of my other requirements was a large trunk space.  Some of the equipment that I carry can be large and long.  Some tripods are 42&quot; collapsed.  The 9-5 also has split fold down rear seats for the trade shows and when one has to carry more gear than a parent with a kid who's the goalie on a hockey team.  Yikes!  NEVER let your kid be a Goalie.

The sound system is researched and designed by Harmon Kardon.  It is above average and very acceptable.  I'm a 40 year old with minor audiophile tendencies, so I'm fairly critical.  Where it lacks is the very low-end.  A sub-woofer with cross over and level control is what this system needs.  

The experience driving this car is very pleasant.  It handles well, but shows some torque steer when pushed hard.  This unfortunately is the legacy of front wheel drive and the enthusiast.  The good news is that winter driving feels safe and stable.  What is most important to you as the buyer?  It sits fairly flat through the corners, but not as flat as a Porsche 911.  But what you gain for this lack of stiff cornering is an amiable ride.  

So far I've put 34,000 miles on this car since February and find it to be a quality vehicle.  I've replaced both halogen headlamps at $ 24 each.  They are easy to change, but, make sure that they seat flat against the holder or you will offend plenty of oncoming drivers.  I imagine I'll be replacing the Michelins in another 15,000 miles.  Not too bad.

Anyone who wants a solid, dependable, and comfortable ride should buy this car.  The level of luxury is similar to what you will see in a BMW/Mercedes and maybe a little higher in the bang for the buck category.  I wouldn't buy this car if I had more than four to transport on a regular basis.  It will haul five but not over long distances and not too comfortably.

I added the BBS wheels and mud flaps.  This car looks sporty, handles well, rides great, sounds good but not incredible, and is just comfortable.   It is a well balanced vehicle that is a joy to drive.<br><br>
