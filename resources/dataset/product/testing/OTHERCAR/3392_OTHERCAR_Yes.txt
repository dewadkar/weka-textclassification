             I just recently got out of my Nissan Quest lease because the lease was up. I loved every moment I had the van. It was a a really smooth ride that got GREAT mileage.
 It was roomy, child friendly, and one of the safest minivans on the road today. I was really debating if I should just re-lease another Quest van, but my kids are not babies anymore and I wanted to try out the 4Runner which I also Love.
  I took my Quest on many trips and I have nothing bad at all to say about it. I have even taken the seats out to move things.  As a mom I know it was nice to be able to change diapers just about anywhere in the van. 
When we went to sporting events I was able to pop the back open and sit back there with the shade right above us. (Great for watching fireworks).
  To drive this Van was like driving no other. It was a very comfortable ride. When my 4Runner lease is up I may go back to the van it was that nice. This Nissan Quest is for anyone wanting to drive in style and comfort <br><br>
