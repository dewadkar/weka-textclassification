            I honestly bought this car because like everyone else
I did it for the looks... I had bought it because it was
a convertible and it just screamed &quot;LOOK AT ME!!!!!&quot; 
And don't get me wrong but the car has some great looks!!
But with those looks also came so many problems that I 
couldn't handle them all.... First of all the convertible
top which was an automatic went down half way and stopped,
then after 10,000 miles the cars rotors went bad due to a 
manufacturer defect but the manufacturer would not cover it 
because it was still a road hazard repair (like brakes),
and then after 13,300 miles the computer system in the car
died and no the warranty would not cover that due to the 
contract I signed stating that any computer fall outs would
be a repair of its own...

What I loved on the vehicle was the looks, comfortability, 
the options, and the power. For a 6 cylinder, this car was  
very powerful in the up and go and while you are also on the road
going 35 mph and needing to go 70 mph... The automobile never had
a problem with any of the power......

Now driving the car is an experience of its own kind.. You feel like 
you are the only one on the road. It is very comfortable, has a lot
of space, smooth ride ( can hardly feel any bumps ), and anyone 
looks great in it.....

Now if you want to buy the car then I would suggest that you buy
the car used and cheap so that when or if anything happens you will
have enough money to fix it, since on the new cars the warranty 
does not mean much.... 

I hope that answered any of the questions you might of had and I 
wish you all the luck on finding the right vehicle!!!<br><br>
