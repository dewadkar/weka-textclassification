            I have now owned my Miata for over nine years.  This is twice as long as I have ever kept any other car, but if I had to buy a new car I would just be buying another Miata.  Since this one is still reliable (123k miles) and lots of fun, what is the point of buying a new one?

I originally bought it for the styling (there was nothing else like it on the road, and I'm shallow that way), but to my surprise soon fell in love with the fact that it is a convertible.  I love putting the top down and just cruising to my destination.  I am often disappointed to get where I am going.  This car is loads of fun to drive and has been extremely reliable for me.  AT 123K I have replaced the convertible top (at seven years), the clutch cylinders (at 67K), and in my only complaint am on my fourth set of spark plug wires.

My wife dislikes this car and says she feels like &quot;road kill&quot; when she is riding in it.  It is small, noisy, and bumpy, and definitely not for everyone.  However it is definitely for me (I live in the Sunshine State).

I would not recommend it for anyone under 25 (the high accident rate crowd).  This car is very tiny and I would not want to be in it in an accident.  I was 35 when I bought mine, but still got tempted into three speeding tickets within the next two years (I've adjusted and have had no tickets within the last seven).  When I was leaving the dealership after my purchase, I noticed the car next to me was longer and taller.  It was also a Honda Civic.  This car should only be driven by an experienced driver who knows how to value their life.<br><br>
