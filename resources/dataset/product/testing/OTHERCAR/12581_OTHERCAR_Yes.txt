            Finally decided to jump on the bandwagon and get a digital camera. I didn't want to just run out and grab the first one I saw because I've seen my share of horrible pictures taken with digital cameras. I checked various sites that have reviews and comparisons (including epinions) and thought that the Powershot S10 seemed to be the best suited for my needs.
Ordered it online for $339 and additionally a larger CompactFlash memory card, 2 rechargable batteries and the charger (which 1 of those batteries comes with). 1/2 hour after it arrived, I was taking and e-mailing my first pictures after just a quick browse of the manual.
It is quite easy to use, nice quality pictures and is nice and small so it can be taken anywhere.
For someone who will use this camera for recreation only, this camera definitely does the trick.

The camera only comes with a 8 megabyte compactflash memory card which means you have a pretty limited space to store your pictures until you either delete them or export them to your computer. [This is why I got the additional card] Of course, the larger picture size (format) you use, the less pictures will fit within that space.

There are 3 picture size settings to choose from and 3 picture compression settings to determine the filesize (and quality) of your pictures:

<b>Picture size settings available:</b>
<i>(Unit of measure is pixels)</i>
Large: 1600 X 1200
Middle: 1280 X 960
Small: 800 x 600
[This setting effects picture size]

<b>Picture compression settings available:</b>
Normal, Fine, Super Fine
[This setting effects picture quality]SuperFine being best, but also taking up more space in memory.

So with the 8 meg memory card that is included you can expect to fit (ROUGHLY) this many pictures on the card:

<b>Settings: (# of pictures)</b>
Small / Superfine: 15
Small / Fine: 33
Small / Normal: 61

Middle: Same as above.
NOTE: I don't see how this is possible, but this is according to Canon themselves. I have not tested this myself as I've only been using "Small/Superfine" as this setting best suits my needs.

Large / Superfine: 4
Large / Fine: 12
Large / Normal: 24

Keep in mind, the smaller file size not only takes up less memory but will reduce the download speed and size if you're say e-mailing photos to friends and family.

The camera takes 2CR5 Lithium batteries (1 provided with camera) [$12.99 in a drug store for name-brand, can be found for roughly half that price at discount clubs or for off brands elsewhere] *OR* the rechargable NB-5H battery (sold separately - but 1 comes with the charger, part# DK110)

<b>Camera size</b>
It's a tiny one alright! :)
It's 4.1 inches long, 2.7 inches high and 1.3 inches deep (that's with the camera off and the lens not sticking out)

According to Canon it weighs 9.5 ounces which does not include battery or memory card.

<b>More</b>
The camera comes with software which allows you to take the pictures from your camera and put them on your computer (and edit them to an extent).

The PowerShot S10 connects to your computer using either the USB port or normal serial (rs-232) port, depending on which you have available.

With mine connected to the USB port, getting the pictures from camera to the computer is reasonable in speed. It's not as fast as copying files to and from a hard drive, but it's faster than writing to a floppy.
