            I bought my silver 1999 2.3 (actually a 2.5 liter engine) about 6 months ago (June 2002.) It had 18,500 miles on it and still had the BMW factory warranty. This has been my dream car ever since I saw it in the movie Goldeneye. I have not been disappointed. The engine is the small 6 cylinder, but provides plenty of acceleration. The shift throw is short and precise. Handling is great, but some purists complain about the BMW "twitch" when going around a turn at a high rate of speed (I haven't experienced the "twitch" since I don't drive that way.)
Putting the top down takes about 10 seconds. The rear window is made of plastic and is always a complaint sore point (A pretty minor gripe for a car of this quality.)
The car is beautiful. The timeless classic roadster look gets me compliments all the time.
I get 24-26 MPG on super unleaded gas. 
I have had no maintenance problems since owning the Z3 and the BMW service computer had no problems recorded.
I love this car.
