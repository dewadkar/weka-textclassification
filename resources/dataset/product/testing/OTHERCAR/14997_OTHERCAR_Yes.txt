            This was my third camera that I brought home during my search for a digital camera.  I am not an electronics expert, by any means, and had a hard time with the camera that you hook up to your computer and have to put a program into to get them to work.  I wanted something easy and quick.  This is the one for that.  You just put the disk in, turn it on, and take the picture.  Switch the button and view the pictures.  Put the disk into your computer and you can send them or save them or view them.  I use it alot.  The battery last for about an hour and a half and holds really well.  I do not feel that it takes the clearest picture.  But, some of the more expensive Sony's might.  I use my other camera for pictures, also.  So, it is fine for me.  I had a hard time finding one at a store, but some of my friends have since purchased them with little difficulty.  It comes with a nice sturdy neck strap.  <br><br>
