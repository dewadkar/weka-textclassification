            I recently drov a Ram 2500 Turbo Diesel with extended cab and short bed. Overall I was less than impressed.
Engine and acceleration: There's nothing cooler than flooring it, feeling the transmission downshift, and hearing the Turbo spool up and provide the added boost. When this sequence went as planned accelaration both from a stand still and at speed were enough to get get this big truck up to traffic speed with little effort and a mild shove in the back, but not the sharp kick you'll get from vehicles with better power to weight ratios. Also, though the transmission usually worked well there were never happened and I just sat there with the pedal to the floor but now extra power.
  And when it did work it usually shifted with a stiff bump. No big deal if considered on its own but when compared to smoother competitors it becomes a problem. One more reminder that it's time for a mechanical redesign.times when I floored it expecting the tach to jump as it downshifted but it 
Ride: Overall pretty good, but then I'm used to driving trucks. Never felt the small bumps But the big ones gave a nice solid thunk. The turning radius seemed doable for an extended cab truck, just watch the tight spaces. It took about 10 minutes to maneuver out of the tight car lot.

Interior: The front seats are comfortable and supportive with everything where you expect it to be but I'd like the radio to be lower. Most trucks I think have it pretty high on the dash because they assume people look away from the road to operate it and shouldn't have to look to far for too long. I on the other hand usually learn to do it al by feel. I like being able to rest an arm on the console and have the radio with in easy reach without moving it. Sounds lazy but I can do it in my Ranger. I think most full size trucks though have the console sitting to far back and the radio mounted too high. 
 
  Other than that everything was pretty easy to reach and where I expected it to be, but I didn't like the rear seats. They weren't as spacious as in the F150 I drove and to make them so you had to push the front seat up uuntil it was uncomfortable.

 The cassette/CD stereo did not impress me. It got loud but I couldn't find the deep bass I really like in a stereo. No matter how hard I try I can't seem to find a factory system even in more expensive full sized trucks that beats my Ranger's cassette deck.

The wood grain dash trim was attractive and all controls were simple and easy to read and figure out. Overall, a good truck but not on par with more advanced offerings from Ford and Chevy.

Brakes: Pedals felt firm, no mushiness. Stops werre sharp.
