            The first time I drove the Mountaineer, it was my friend's. We were driving back to school after Thanksgiving, and he'd taken his mom's Mountaineer because it was better equipped to handle winter in Massachusetts than his Cougar. About halfway there, he said he had a headache and wanted me to drive. I reluctantly accepted. I had never driven anything near its size before, and at first was nervous about how it would handle at highway speeds. About 5 miles into the journey, my fears subsided. The car handled great, and the cruise control was wonderful. It was comfortable to drive, and I never noticed the bulk of the car once I was behind the wheel. By the time we got to school it was as if I'd been driving the car my whole life.
This car is great for anyone who wants a lot more cargo room and lots of passenger space, but doesn't want to re-learn how to drive. However that creates a disadvantage. You aren't going to use the mountaineer to conquer the Rockies, or even that trail in the woods by your house. This is strictly an on-road vehicle. If you want to go 4 wheeling, get a Jeep, Land Rover, or Hummer. 
The Mountaineer is a great family vehicle. You'll love driving it, you can fit tons of groceries, and the kids will appreciate the spacious back seat. If you want anything more, look at something else.<br><br>
