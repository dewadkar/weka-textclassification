            For the photographer who wants fine results and maximum individual control, all at an affordable price, there is little doubt that this is the ultimate choice.  My model 2000UX at $799 came equipped with an IBM 340 MB microdrive that fits into the CompactFlash type 2 card slot.  This drive provides for 400 fine 1600 X 1200 pictures.  More than enough for almost anyone before downloading and/or deleting.

For individual exposure control the 2000UX offers total automatic, aperture priority, shutter priority, auto focus, manual focus, preset modes for portraits, landscapes and panoramic as well as nightscene and macro settings.  The movie mode provides for 30 seconds of 320 X 240 AVI format recording, and the panoramic mode allows 9 separate photos to be put together with ease allowing a complete shot of any bridge, mountain or canyon one might encounter.

The on-screen menus are well designed and easy to use, if somewhat overwhelming at first glance.  After a few tries, everything falls into place and seems normal.  Connection with the USB cable is simple and downloading is completed in a flash.  The included software is simple to load and easy to use.  The included video cable connects to most television sets through the video in slot and allows pictures to be reviewed in a large scale.  Deleting unwanted images is a simple task an is done with a minimum of commands.

My three quibbles (be they such) are, first, with the batteries included.  They last only minutes, but a visit to Radio Shack for NiMH replacements works wonders.  Second is the requirement stated in the users guide that the &quot;optional&quot; AC adapter is required for connection and use of the USB cable.  How can something required be viewed as optional?  The adapter should have been included as part of the package.  The third problem (and perhaps it is just me) is that it takes several seconds to open the camera (which turns it on) then several more seconds for the camera to become ready to shoot.  For those who are used to picking up a camera ant taking a picture, this requires some re-education.  Perhaps were I still using a speed graphic, or and 8 X 10 view camera this would not be such a big deal.  At worst it is a minor inconvenience.

These three caveats aside, this is a tremendous camera and one that will bring a great deal of satisfaction and pleasure to any photographer, particularly to one who wants the opportunity to exercise a great deal of individual control.  The resulting pictures will please even the most discerning critic.<br><br>
