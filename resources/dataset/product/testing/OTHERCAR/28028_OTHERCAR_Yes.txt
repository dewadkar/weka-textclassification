            I have driven this car, which belongs to a friend, and I was more impressed after driving it than I was when she first told me she purchased it.  Silver is one of the most pleasing colors for this time of car, and it looks like a silver bullet as it goes on the road.  The car took corners well, even corners that were taken quickly.  This is not a sports car, nor is a high performance car, so it should not be compared to cars that are capable of more.  This is an inexpensive vehicle, but it performs well when compared to other lower level vehicles.  I really liked the interior of the car, which offered plenty of room for average to long legs in the front seat, as well as the back.  The dash board is also pleasant to look at, and I recommend the cd player as an option.  The sound system that comes with the car is good quality, but not incredible.  

A few types of people should buy this vehicle:  those who want to drive a new car, but can't afford most new cars out there, those who want a fully loaded car, every option, young people who would rather drive a brand new car than an older mid- or upper-level car.<br><br>
