            I used a Fuji 4700 for almost a year and loved it. Great shots right out of the box, all the time except in low light situations when the auto focus didn't work even though the flash was more than adequate.
Not so with the 6800. Very slow focusing even when it does work. 50% of the images are out of focus. You must really wait (much longer than on the 4700) at the halfway shutter point.
The rechargeable AA's in the 4700 are less expensive than the proprietary battery in the 6800 and the AA's last longer and can be purchased at Radio Shack or elsewhere.
Porsche forgot the rubber finger grip and eyeglass bumper block both present on the 4700. 
The display wipe is annoying and the alternate wipes won't download from the web site as they should. Can't get any help from Fuji.
This is my last Fuji. A big disappointment from a previously happy 4700 user.
See the other reviews for more details. I just filled in what I thought they left out.
