            This is a review of the new 2001 red Tiburon that I bought yesterday through cars direct.com the site thats linked up to epinions.com.
It's different buying a new car through carsdirect.com. No pressure at all from them unlike dealers who will try every trick in the book to sell a car.
The car is a cherry red color with pretty paint but I don't think the paint on Hyundai cars can match Toyota or Honda in quality. The car is very sleek and cool to look at as you can tell in the photo. Being called a poor man's Porshe in another review is a good description of this car.
You sit in the car and it's like being in a sports car but  the engine does not have sports car performance,16 second quarter miles will not get your heart beating very fast.
The accessories that are standard on all new Tiburons are very impressive and especially for this price range.
The car is fun to drive. It seems to sit low and the instumentation gives you a cockpit feeling while driving. It seems Hyundai did not want to cut corners with this car and it looks and feels like a more expensive car as most reviewers comment on. The cars seems reasonably quiet to me and the engine is smooth. The clutch is sticking shifting going into 1st gear but I think this car just needs to be broken in a bit and that will dissapear. The brakes are very good and this gives me a feeling of safety in the car. The seat in back seems cramped for adults but opening up the hatchback reveals a lot of storage space "IF" the back seat is folded down. Because the passenger window is so small this causes a blind spot when you look to the left while in the drivers seat so I would not recommend this as a first car because of that blind spot.
Hyundai has come a long way since their lowly Excels of a dozen years ago and all the cars in their product line are worth looking at especially with the unbeatable warranty now offered
