            In November 1999, my husband was in an accident in our Nissan Sentra that left him unharmed thanks to the airbag and seatbelt.  Unfortunately, the Nissan didn't fare so well.  It was totaled!!

When I went down to the rental car place, I found that the cars that my insurance would pay for were all gone.  For an additional 5 bucks a day, I decided to upgrade to a 2000 Chevy Malibu.

I am so completely happy that I did!  

Normally, I am not a Chevy person, but this car changed my mind.

The first thing that I was totally impressed with was how roomy this car is!  I stand 5'9&quot; and in every car I have ever driven, I have had to push the driver's seat all the way back just so that my legs had the room to move, and didn't get jammed up under the steering wheel.  In the Malibu, I actually had to move the seat forward.  There was also plenty of headroom.

The rest of the car had lots of room as well.  I got in the back seat to adjust my daughter's car seat, and found that I didnt feel cramped like I have in so many other cars.  Even the trunk was huge!

Next, I found the power that this car had was totally surprising.  Granted, I had been used to driving a 4-cylinder Nissan, but the Malibu's V6 had all kinds of get up and go!  I even took it out onto the freeway just so that I could test out the power!

All in all, I would have to say the Chevrolet did a wonderful job in the Malibu.  It completely changed my mind about Chevrolet, and my next car is going to be a Malibu.
