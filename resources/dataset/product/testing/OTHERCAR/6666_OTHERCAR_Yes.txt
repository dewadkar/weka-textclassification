            This vehicle is a sporty sport utility that has very styling body. It catches your eye but then you ask your self a Chevy? Yes a Chevy. It's very nice inside and a very nice stock sound system. The 4 cylinder puts out 97 hp. 
The light weight of the vehicle allows for quick acceleration.The braking system is very quick at stopping the vehicle. Just apply a light pressure to the brake for a great amount of stopping power. The handling of the vehicle is very good.
It corners very quick with a very tight turning radius. The ride is a little bumpy like a sports car it lets you feel the road beneath you. The A/C put out cool air in the summer and Hot air in the winter that warms the car in about a minute. The suspension is solid with hardly any roll in the turns.
I recommend a person that is single or either not planning on having a family soon. This isn't a very good family car. Great to take to the beach though. A person that wants some thing sporty and nice for a low price.<br><br>
