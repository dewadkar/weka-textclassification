            <b>Why I bought the Canon Powershot A70</b>
After watching the price fall on the 3 mega pixel cameras, I decided now was the time to buy. I did an extensive amount of research on digital cameras, which resulted in a short list for me to consider. My short list included the following: Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, and Canon. 

I chose the Canon A70 for the following reasons...

<b>Superior Body Style Design</b>
I like the way Canon has designed the body of the Powershot A70. While the camera is very small, they have designed a thicker handle on the right side to improve the fit in your hand. When I hold a camera, I naturally grip the camera with my right hand. The Canon feels more comfortable in my hand than most of the other brands. 

The A70 also comes with a tripod mount in the center of the camera. The A70 fits very nice and balanced on a tripod, which is very helpful for low light photography.

I also like the use of a power button versus the front covers that you slide back and forth. I fear a lot of moving parts on a camera, because I believe the more moving parts the more likely something is to break. I also had a difficult time in the store trying to turn off the Olympus. You had to slide the cover to just the right spot in order to activate the power down routine, and then you had to wait for the lens to retract to push the cover all the way over. I prefer to turn off a camera with a single push of one button, rather than a two step approach.

<b>CompactFlash Media</b>
The A70 uses the very popular CompactFlash cards. Based on my research, I knew that I would want to buy a much larger card than what came with the camera. After pricing our the various storage media options, I discovered that I would save several dollars if I bought a camera that used the CompactFlash media. I also spoke to a friend of mine who owned a camera that uses the smaller media. My friend informed me that it was very easy to misplace the smaller cards. 

<b>Movie Mode with Sound</b>
I did not buy the A70 for the purpose of trying to film movies with it. But I do have children and there have been many times when I had my camera and wished I had my camcorder. Sometimes you just want to record a few short seconds of something your child is doing. I like that the Canon A70 gives you the option of recording video images with sound.

<b>Manual Controls</b>
I do a lot of photography, and sometimes I like the ability to override the settings on my camera. The Canon A70 had one of the best set of manual controls of any camera in its class. My wife uses the camera in auto mode, and I play around with manual controls to get the picture that I want.

<b>Optional Lenses</b>
The Canon A70 also supports additional lenses. Today, I do not see a need for additional lenses, but I like the fact that I have the option to add lenses should I change my mind. The Canon A70 is a flexible camera that can grow with you. 

<b>My Personal Experiences of owning the A70</b>
I am very glad that I bought the Canon Powershot A70. I have not been disappointed with it and I have owned it for about one month. In addition to the items mentioned above, here are some more things that I like about the Canon A70...

<b>Image Quality</b>
Wow, the A70 takes a great picture. I have been very impressed with the quality of pictures that both my wife and I have taken. The colors appear to be rich and true to the actual colors. I have taken several pictures in low light conditions and the pictures have turned out great. I cannot tell a difference between my digital prints and my old 35 mm camera.

<b>Battery Life</b>
After reading many reviews on digital cameras, I was expecting a really bad battery life. I am very happy to say that after one month, I am still using the batteries that came with the camera (4 standard AA). The A70 has exceeded my expectations for battery life, although my expectations were pretty low.

<b>Flash and red eye reduction</b>
The flash on the A70 works very well. The flash appears to have a decent range for a small compact camera and the red eye reduction works reasonably well. Like most compact camera designs, the flash is too close to the lens and it does have a tendency to produce red eyes. The flash does a good job of minimizing the red eyes, but it does not eliminate them. 

<b>Magnify Feature on the LCD Viewer</b>
I was very impressed to find that the LCD viewer came with a magnify feature. I was able to zoom in on the eyes of my baby to determine if they were open or closed in the pictures. So while the screen may be small, the ability to zoom in on a picture has proven to be very helpful.

<b>Concerns and things I do not like</b>
Overall, I do not have a lot of concerns or dislikes for my A70. I would prefer a metal body to the plastic body, but the plastic body appears to be pretty solid. Likewise, I would prefer a metal tripod mount to the plastic one on the A70. I suspect that the plastic will strip more easily.

While I really like the LCD on the back of the A70, I wish it had some controls to adjust the brightness. At times, the image is almost too bright. While I prefer erring on the side of too bright rather than too dark, I would like the ability to adjust the brightness myself. 

It took me a few days to realize that the digital zoom on the camera was turned off, which is the default setting on the A70. Personally, I think the default setting should be to activate the digital zoom giving the camera full functionality. 

<b>Conclusion</b>
Overall, I have been very pleased with my Canon Powershot A70. The price was very competitive and the A70 offered features not available by most of its competitors. The camera is easy to operate and at the same time offers manual controls for the more advanced users. I highly recommend the Canon Powershot A70.
