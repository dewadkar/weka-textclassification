            Audi Allroad quatro 2002.

Half Sedan, Half SUV!

Is it a car? Is it a SUV? No, it&#146s the Audi Allroad quatro. 

I guess the Allraod is trying to attract the person who is an Executive during the week and a party animal on weekend. Actually to me the Allroad resembles a lot like the Subaru wagon, both in appearance and in technology.

I took one out for a test drive lets see how I rated it.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Audi Allroad looks more like a wagon than either a sedan or an SUV. Not this is bad; it is a very stylish wagon. Audi is trying to combine in the same vehicle the comfort and luxury of a German sedan and the off-road capability of a SUV.

The Allroad is equipped with a ton of standard luxury features and to complement this they also added more features that will make the off-roading more pleasant.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As I opened the driver&#146s side door I was surprised to see leather seats, not just any leather seats but heated and made of superior quality leather. The interior is luxurious and well designed, unless you look in the back you do have the impression that you are at the wheel of a luxury sedan.

From behind the steering wheel the all around vision is excellent, if there is one thing I would have liked to see, it would be larger side view mirrors. All the gauges and the control buttons are easy to see reach from that position. 

There are so many unusual features in that vehicle, that anyone who buys one should really take the time to read the owner&#146s manual. For example: It comes equipped with a four-position height adjustable suspension. This suspension can raise the height of the Allroad from 5.6 inches to a full 8.2 inches.

Here is a list of other standard equipment it comes with: Self adjusting headlights, walnut interior trim, air conditioning, power windows, power locks power mirrors, cruise control, sunroof, alloyed wheels, luggage rack and an AM/FM cassette/CD sound system.

The front and rear head and legroom in the Allroad is adequate. 

The exterior:

As I wrote above the Audi Allroad does look like a wagon from the exterior, I did appreciate the electrically folding mirrors, as soon as one is touched by an obstacle they fold in to minimize the damages. 

There is a lot of room for transporting all your equipment; the cargo volume available is 36.5 cubic feet.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I did not drive the Allroad off-road, but it does handle like a luxury sedan on both the highway and the within the city limits.
