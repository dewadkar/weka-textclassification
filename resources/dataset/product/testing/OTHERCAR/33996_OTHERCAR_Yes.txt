            Prior to this vehicle, I owned a baby blue 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and I sold it for $700 in May of 2002.  Dealer incentives were great at the time and I could not pass up the 36 month - 1.9% APR. Sticker price was $35,400.  I got it down to $31,800 and used my GM card earnings and loyalty coupon to knock off another $2,000.  Standard warranty was 5 yr. /60,000 mile.

City driving (Chicago):

Using the driver information center, my dash showed I was getting only 13.8 MPG.  I reset this information and changed the air filter to a K&N filter and I am now getting 15.2 MPG.  Every little bit counts.

Highway driving:

Wind noise...I checked all of the seals around the doors and made sure everything seated correctly...still a bit of an annoyance.

Driving in summer heat with Auto climate control on will load the engine under certain conditions.  I was surprised when I tried to punch the accelerator, engine performance was noticeably affected, just enough to add a few seconds to your passing time.

Winter driving (Chicago):

Don't drive this vehicle like a passenger car.  The 17" Michelin's are great handling tires from the spring rain to summer heat...but look out for snow. Even with Smart Trak it is easy to spin the vehicle when making a low speed turn...don't drift and don't hit the brakes; keep a little bit of power going to the wheels.

Availability of Accessories:

Really tough to find, the only thing I added on my Bravada was a Corsa dual exhaust tip and Westin CPS Step Bars.  Manik is the only other manufacturer who makes front brush guards for the Bravada.

Whipple has come out with a twin screw Supercharger that adds 100+ horsepower to the 4.2L Vortec I6...but bolting this unit on would void my 7/70 warranty - read below.

Automatic mirrors.

When you save the settings for Driver 1 and Driver 2, and you switch between these settings, the mirror settings tend to "wander".  This is a documented problem in one of the TSBs.  The tech told me he could not replace the motors in the mirrors under warranty unless the motors failed.  Anyone have a EMP pulse gun?


Recalls:

1. The 270 HP inline 6 has a history of cracking of the ceramic sleeves that line the cylinder bores.  Once this happens, the repair process is extensive.  GM has extended my warranty to 7 yr/ 70,000 miles to cover the labor and repair should I ever encounter this problem.  I do not know if this offer extends to '02 GMC Envoy and Chevy Trailblazer owners.

2. Recall that involves adjustment of a mechanical override that allows the key to be removed with the shift lever in a position other than Park.

3. Recall that involves reprogramming of the dash information center so that all of the lights and gauges don't spontaneously quit.

Conclusion:

Is there a perfect vehicle out there for everyone?  I don't know, but what I do know is that I will still take care of my Bravada.
