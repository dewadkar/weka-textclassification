            Well, not exactly... but if you're in the market for a practical, sporty, and stylish vehicle, the new jetta is for you.  Now, I'm not one to buy into major advertising campaigns, but you have to admit that that New Orleans-French Quarter advertisement (you know, the one where everything starts happening in time with that eclectic commercial soundtrack) does captivate and intrigue, and apparently consumers are buying: driving in the suburbs the other night, i found myself in the center lane of southbound traffic, flanked by a red '99 jetta to my right and a silver '00 jetta to my left (i was the black '99 in the middle).  

This car is tight, and i don't mean that in referrence to size: the jetta is as roomy as they come, and even my 6'5&quot;, 300 lb. linebacker pal was able to fit comfortably in the passenger seat (albeit with the sunroof open).  The trunk is awe-inspiring in its roominess, and with gas prices as high as they currently are, we often opt to take my car for camping and hiking trips because we can not only pack the entire campsite into my trunk, but we can also afford the gas for our return trip (i average 42 mpg [gallon] on my 5-speed).  It's a quiet, smooth ride, and the car itself is comfortable... i tend to be a restless spirit and a restless driver, so my back tends to ache after long drives (probably from my fidgeting, though), but my passengers never complain!

I purchased this car after having driven a ford and 2 toyotas (major mechanical problems with the ford, and just wasn't happy with the toyotas [we purchased and then later leased 2 different models in this line]), and i had been shopping the volkswagens for some time.  It was practical, sensible, and grounded, while also seeming to symbolize all the old ethics of revolution and conservation and awareness (before, of course, becoming the vehicle of the masses)-- thus selling me on not only volkswagen, but the jetta, as well. <br><br>
