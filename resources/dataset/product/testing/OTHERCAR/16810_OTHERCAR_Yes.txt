            When I am driving down the road I recently have been seeing a lot of ladies driving the new Camaro, whereas the guys are driving the older ones.  Why is this?  Is it because of the driving ease of the newer cars or maybe Daddy just has a lot of money.  Either one would make sense, I personally think that it is the first one.  The driving ease and the control of the car make it very easy to drive, and the comfort inside makes it the perfect party car.  Although the back is a little cramped I doubt that is what is going through your mind when riding in such a beautiful car.  The Camaro is a great car for both guys and girls but it seems that the girls have recognized this first.  The only thing that I didn't like about the Camaro was the fact that it was not a dependable car and should not be driven for 3hrs. straight, the engine on any sports car will automatically run hot, but on the Camaro it runs even hotter, if you were to get stuck in traffic you would more than likely overheat.  Other than that this is a great car and should be treated with respect by both guys and girls of any age.    <br><br>
