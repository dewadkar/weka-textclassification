            I purchased a new 1998 Chevrolet Blazer LT 4x4 4-door almost two years ago.  I live in an area where ther are rural roads and occasional ice and snow.  I also have a small child and am very concerned about her being in a vehicle that is safe. It came with a three year auto club type plan, but one use of their service (for corroded battery cables) showed me it was better to stick with AAA (due to a 45 minute wait on the phone).  It turns out they use the AAA for their service calls anyway, so I could have saved myself a lot of time by calling them directly. 
The Blazer is a very comfortable vehicle to drive.  The number of windows all but eliminate blind spots.  It rides well and is easy to steer.  The actual gas mileage runs between 18 and 24 MPG depending on the type of driving you do.  The split rear fold down seats are great when you have to transport large or odd-shaped items.  There two extra plug in ports (other than the cigarette lighter) for cell phone, etc. 
The back seat will fit two adults and a small child with relative comfort, but the placement of the center seat belt would make it uncomfortable for three adults.  Also, the center rear will not accommodate a child safety seat.
