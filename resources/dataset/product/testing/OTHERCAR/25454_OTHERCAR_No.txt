            We leased our SL1 due to the very reasonable rates at the time.  The Saturn dealership was very pleasant and easy to deal with.  There were no hidden charges, no typical &quot;what can I do to put you in this car today&quot; salesman tactics.  It was a simple matter of laying out the cost of the vehicle- the MSRP and the leasing terms.  That alone is reason enough to consider purchasing a Saturn- if the actual car itself was a better product.

First the good points- the SL1 does seem to have better build quality than it's GM stablemates such as the Chevy Cavalier/ Pontiac Sunfire. The car feels well made, other than the somewhat cheap interior materials.  This is an easy car to handle and would be a good choice for a young person learning to drive. Unfortunately, those are about the only good points I can list.

The major shortcoming in this car is the engine.  The standard 100-hp, iron-block 8-valve 4 cylinder with an automatic transmission is completely substandard.  This is a very slow car- You have to get it up to about 4500 RPM to get it to move, and even then, it is underwhelming.  If you are trying to merge on the freeway with passengers and A/C on, you really have to think ahead.  Due to this lack of power, it is very difficult to hold a 65 or 70 mph cruising speed.  The really unfortunate thing is that even as underpowered as this engine is, the car does still not get good gas mileage.  I average 21-22 in town, 25-26 on the highway.  Honda and Toyota 6 cylinders get better mileage than that.

My main other complaint is the interior size.  This is a compact car and as such is not expected to be huge, but it should at least accommodate average people.  I am 6'1&quot; and this car is very uncomfortable for me to drive for more than a half hour or so.  There is a intrusion of the wheel well on at the left foot that causes me to either put my foot on top of it, which makes my knee hit the steering wheel, or move my leg over and put it behind the brake pedal, which is not the safest thing in the world to do.  This is a compact car, like I said, but I don't have these problems in say, a Corolla or Civic, which are the same size.

In conclusion, I would say that anyone considering a SL series should consider only the SL2- it has a more powerful engine.  If you simply must get an SL1, get it with a manual transmission- the automatic simply robs too much power, and the engine doesn't have it to spare.  This car is a good choice for students or smaller adults, but anyone over 5'10&quot; should avoid this model.

For the money, A Civic or Corolla (or even a Mazda protege) is a better choice.
