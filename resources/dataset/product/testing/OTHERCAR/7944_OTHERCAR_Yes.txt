            Did you ever have a car you loved so much that you named it? I had a 97 Wrangler up until 2 months ago. I called him &quot;Old Blue.&quot; I can honestly say it was the best car I ever had. I loved the soft top. On a nice day you are topless in 2 minutes, and in 5 minutes the top was back on secure, and you could do it by yourself. The shift on the fly up to 55 mph was outstanding. Most of the time of owning &quot;Old Blue&quot; I lived in the South, and the 4x4 shift on the fly came in handy during the summer thunderstorms. This is definitely a Jeep's Jeep. But even being a Jeep, it had a great interior. With Navajo print seats and tan interior, it was a sharp looking vehicle. The top never leaked in water, which was a problem with earlier models. I never once had it in the shop except for oil changes. It was rather loud on the highway, so if you are doing a lot of highway driving I would recommend something else. The reason I no longer drive it is because the lease was up and I now have a one hour commute and wanted a quieter ride. But every nice day, I miss &quot;Old Blue.&quot; Overall, good price, good gas mileage and minimal maintenance makes this a smart choice. <br><br>
