            Nissan Maxima is a great car!! I own a 1991 Nissan and a 1998. They are the best cars to own. I didn't buy the cars my parents did! but when they bought the 1998 they gave me the 1991. 

I love this car because it has so much power! You can really move in this baby! The seats are so comfortable and you can just relax while driving! The steering and driving is great! this car has a Standard engine. 6 Cylinder, 3.0 Liter, 160 Horsepower Engine! Its great! there is not 1 thing I hate about this car! Its such a nice color (pearl white).

The vehicle is for people who love to drive in comfort! Also if you would like this car you would probably like a Honda or Saturn. If you don't enjoy driving and love good power in a car then, I wouldn't recommend this car to you!
