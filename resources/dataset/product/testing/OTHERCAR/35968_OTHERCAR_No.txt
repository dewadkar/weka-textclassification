            I bought my 1999 Honda Civic in June 1999. I needed a new car because we found out that I was sick and would be traveling to a different city for doctors appointments. When I saw my Honda I thought it was pretty, sensible, and reliable.I bought my Honda because of the good things that people say about them.

The first thing I noticed about my Honda was the lack of power. It will not climb a hill very well, and that is a problem since I live in Tennessee. There are a lot of hill and mountains were I live.

Before my first oil change I found several things wrong with my car. The air conditioner would not cool well. It had a funny smell when you turned it on. There was also a &quot;peck&quot; in my motor.

My car is not quite a year old now and I have had to have it serviced 5 times. The valves had to be adjusted, the belts always need to be tightened, the air conditioner needed to be serviced, the front end has been aligned because it pulled hard to the right. In fact, it needs to be aligned again. It is pulling to the right again.

I contacted my district manager to see if we could do something on my car. I was paying way too much for this car to have it in the shop a lot. When I voiced my opinion to him, his exact words were &quot;Well mam, you did buy our lowest equipped model. You cannot expect a lot.&quot; 

He then asked me if I would consider trading my car for another one. I told him I would consider it because I had always heard good things about Honda's. He told me he was going to contact the sales manager and they would work something up for me. I needed to call back in a couple of days.

I was in town a couple of days later, so I stopped in. The sales manager came out and told me that we could not trade because I had not had the car long enough. I tried to call the district manager, amd he will not accept my calls.

Now... the handle on my heater vent fell off and my defroster does not seem to want to work. I am stuck for 7 years because I cannot sell it for payoff.
I will not buy a Honda next time. 

By the way... I had my last car for three years. The only time it went to the shop was for an oil change. Too bad for me that I traded it in.
