            The biggest decision I made this past year was to trade my '98 Disco for a 2002 Disco Series II.  The decision was not as easy as one would think.  First of all a Land Rover is more than a vehicle it is a way of life.  You really grow attached to a vehicle that never lets you down and does whatever you ask.  My wife likes to think of the Rover as a part of the family (which is why it was so hard to part with the old one).  The Series II is a refined version of the tried and true Land Rover Discovery which dates back to 1985.  The Series II is only the second generation of this vehicle.

For those who have never owned a Discovery here's a brief run down of the features.

4WD

Land Rovers have historically been the most capable off road vehicles available.  While the Series II is a highly refined consumer version of the good old Rover it is still a highly capable off road vehicle.  This is due to the fact that it uses an all time four wheel drive system.  The differential lock system on the Old Discoveries has been replaced by a traction control system on the Series II.  This is convenient for those who are not off road enthusiasts and basically takes away the guess work on when to lock the Differentials.  The truck now does this for you through a combination of a traction control system using the ABS brake system and a center/front/back differential.  The system shines in adverse weather conditions such as snow or mud.  You can actually feel the vehicle 'eating' through snow and mud.  We had 2 feet of snow during a pretty bad snow storm this past year and the Rover made it through 4 foot snow drifts with ease (REALLY!).

STYLE

This vehicle, although 80% redesigned, still looks like a Discovery.  This does well for re sale values as a '90 Discovery looks pretty much the same as a '02.  The classic look and feel add to the nostalgic Land Rover appeal.  Both the interior follow the form follows function rule.  This may not be the best looking vehicle but you will come to appreciate the way this vehicle functions and overlook the not so pretty exterior.  The interior has been refined, and with the optional wood package and leather seats, looks like the best of them.  Comfortable and well appointed interior with plenty of room.  The Series II retains the theater style seating in back thanks to the raised roof.  This also allows for a huge amount of Cargo Space.

PERFORMANCE

On road the vehicle performs OK.  It still rides like a truck but feels much more stable than the old DISCO.  The engine has been tweaked and the extra horse power is noticeable.  You can acutally pass cars on the highway now.  The vehicle has also been stablaized a bit to reduce body roll in the turns.  And by the way, do not be fooled by the top heavy look of the vehicle.  This vehicle actually has the lowest center of gravity of any SUV and the threat of a roll over is almost non existant as 80% of the body weight lies along the wheel line.  This is acheived by using Aluminum instead of Steal for body panels (Aluminum is much lighter than Steal).

FUN FACTOR

This vehicle is fun to drive.  It will take you anywhere and will do just about anything you would expect from a truck with the heritage of Land Rover.  Do not expect this vehicle to be fast or agile, buy a car if you are looking for a perfomrance vehicle.  If you do find yourself off road, the new Hill Descent Feature will have you looking like a pro as you descend the steep inclines.  The truck actually goes into an automatic mode where you take your feet off the gas and brakes and you let the truck do all the work when going down a very steep descent (I MEAN VERY STEEP).

SUMMARY

This is a very capable off road vehicle that does just fine on the road as well.  It is dependable as well.  I am now going on my fifth year with a Discovery and have yet to have a service issue.  Thats right, I have yet to have a Rover break down on me.  Furthermore, my trips to the service shop have been for minor problems; an oil leak and throttle body problem (which I think I casued).  Other than that they have been rock solid.  My '02 has yet to be returned to the shop which is more than I can say for my wife's '01 explorer which has been in service about 7 times.  And talking about service, the service facilities at the Land Rover Dealer is top notch.  I have yet to make a formal 'appointment', I am usually told to 'just bring it in when I get a chance'.  I guess the service departments are not that busy.  Last time I was there I think I saw the Maytag Repair man having coffee with the service manager.
