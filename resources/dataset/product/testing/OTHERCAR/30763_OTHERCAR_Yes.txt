            I can highly recommend this camera for the following reason:

The Olympus is quite inexpensive. You don�t have to worry about spending so much money for something, which might end up old in a couple of weeks.

The Olympus is easy to use. As it still has a traditional hardware design, everybody understands how to use it. Just press and it�s done. Even downloading is easy. And battery life is forever, as long as you don�t use the screen too much�

It is extremely robust. I have been using this camera for a couple of month on a daily basis. I don�t use any extra protection bag, I just have it in my trousers or in my bag and never had any problems. Once the red cap on the front bottom went off, but this cap has no functionality and anyway I could put it back again easily and didn�t go off again.

It is quite flexible: as there are three levels of resolution, you are very flexible: for the usage as a diary, reminders I just take the lowest resolution. For some special motives I take the highest, which is more than you will ever use for web-design. 

Another great feature: you can get quite close to objects. I used it to �scan� icons or to take pictures of insects (I went to Asia and Insects are frightening there�). Both no problem!

Let me mention some disadvantages:
The worst thing about the Olympus is that there is some delay between pressing the trigger and the camera taking the picture. I hate this! With this camera it is impossible to take snap shots, because the picture you take is actually 0.5 seconds (maybe even more) delayed.

The camera is quite heavy.

The download time is long, as long as you just use the actual kit. If you buy a floppy adapter for the smartcard, download time is fairly quick.

If you use the screen a lot, battery life is quite short. But one really doesn�t need the display at all. 

No zoom. So if you want to take a picture of an interesting building or tree far away, you are lost!
