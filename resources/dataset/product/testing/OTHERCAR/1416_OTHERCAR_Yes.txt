            When I got my 1998 Dodge Neon in October of 2000, it was the first new car that I had ever gotten.  For the price, the first thing I noticed was how sleek it looked.  THe outside is very sharp looking and the inside is comfy.  Other than a few minor things, I had loved it so far.

PROS:
   This car can really fly!  WIth the exception of hills, this car can cut any corner and it's not hard at all to pass others on the road.  The seats are made of a generic material, but they are marginally comfortable.  For tall people, such as myself, room is not an issue.  Everything is easily reachable.  I got mine with several bells and whistles, such as a CD player and sunroof. FOr a factory system, you can really turn your radio way up and get a high quality sound.  The sunroof, though loud, always seems to work.  Trunk space is plentiful.  You could fit several bodies in there if you wanted.  From the outside, the Neon looks more expensive than it really is.  I don't care for the '00-'01 models, but the'98 version is sweet looking without being tacky.

CONS:
    THe engine for this little car is really loud.  When you change gears, there is a crunching sound.  Neither is too fateful, but they are annooying nonetheless.  The windows are frameless, making the door hard to open on really cold mornings.  Also, going at fast speeds, the car tends to be blown around the road, as it is very light.

OVERALL:
   You get what you pay for: a pretty good economy car.  The gas is good and is made with the young consumer in mind.  There is nothing particulary fancy about the car, other than it's fairly suave looks.  I noticed that a lot of people have had trouble with their head gaskets.  No problem here.  I haven't had any problems up to this point.  THis is a good car to have fun in, take long trips in, etc.  Could possibly even fit a small family for a trip
