            Background on X-5: 
I ordered the BMW X-5 (4.4L)for my wife in late December and took new delivery about two weeks later with the following options: CD/changer, Xenon lights, Activity Package, GPS navigation, and Moon Roof. The MSRP was $54,360 (with no discounts provided)and I leased the vehicle (3 year, 15,000 miles per year, and 70% residual). My wife and I have placed a little over 2,000 miles on the X-5, with one 350 mile roadtrip. Currently, I am a long-time BMW owner (previously owned a '92 325i, and currently driving a'98 M3)and enjoy performance driving. My wife is a conservative driver (previously a '87 Volvo 245 and currently a '96 Volvo 850) and desires &quot;safety&quot; in a vehicle for our two children. Both of us primarily drive manual transmission vehicles.

Positive Reactions to X-5: 
Favorable to Outstanding. Specifically, the X-5 really handles as compared to other SUVs. I checked out the Lexus RX-300, the Mercedes, and the Rover. Each of these left me cold in terms of handling, cornering, and braking (and I think I scared the salesman a little during the road tests). After reading about the X-5, I bought it sight unseen (no road test) depending upon the magazine's reviewer's tastes,and I have not been disappointed. For a vehicle of its size, the handling and performance is impressive, and the automatic transmission is quick and smooth. During a recent ice storm, I took the vehicle on the road and was amazed at the capability of the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) system. Similarly, my wife recently took a long road trip with the kids, and said that it was the first time she truly felt in control when passing semi's. She likes the visibility, the &quot;feeling&quot; of safety, and surprisingly for me, the handling qualities (she says that it makes her feel in control). In other factors, the fit and finish is superb, the GPS is relatively straight-forward to operate, and the CD/radio is surprisingly listenable. I've read several comments that the 2-piece tailgate is awkward, but we've not found this to be the case. By the way, we have constant positive comments on the vehicle whenever it is parked.

Negative Reactions to X-5:
This is difficult. We are averaging 17 mpg (mix of freeway and suburb driving); this about what I expected. The vision out of the rear is less than optimal when backing, but the rear-view mirrors reposition themselves during backing which helps. Finally, the major negative is the price; based on competition, I think the vehicle is overpriced by about $5,000---but after reflecting on BMW's market positioning of the 540i, I can understand the pricing strategy.

BMW Service:
We had only one &quot;fit and finish&quot; issue (the rear tailgate light switch was not adjusted correctly, and occasionally would not turn-off). Because I bought the vehicle about 75 miles from my home, I took it to another BMW dealer where the item was correctly (with some grousing that the selling dealer should have noticed the problem in pre-sale's checkouts). No problems other than the need for an appointment, no loaner car, and lost time.

My Verdict:
A superb vehicle; while I personally like sporty cars (ala my M3, and my dreamcar, the M5), I find the driving the X-5 more than acceptable with competent/safe handling; it clearly bests all of its competitor's in this department. In terms of styling and interior, it easily bests Lexus, Mercedes, and Rover. I can highly recommend the vehicle based on the first 2000 miles of driving.<br><br>
