               I have been the proud owner of a 1990 Toyota Corolla for almost a year now, and I am proud to say that I have become a firm believer in the Toyota name.  When I bought the car, it had about 180,000 miles on it.  It now has over 192,000 miles on it and it's still running great and getting about 30 miles to the gallon.
   Unlike previous cars I've owned, I've only had to take it in to get the oil changed.  I've been very pleased with its reliability.  It has a decent amount of power, and amazingly enough, I can often get five people into it without too many complaints.  There is also quite a bit of trunk space considering the size of the car.  The A/C works very well, too.
   The only complaint I have is one that I've heard quite often from other owners: the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light.  In my case, it seems that there is something loose in the exhaust system somewhere.  It's not a problem that affects the way it drives or the smog systems or anything.  When whatever it is jiggles loose, the light comes on until it jiggles back into place.  The dashboard light, however, can be somewhat of a nuisance when it should be a help.
   After the problems I had with my last vehicle, I am pleased to be owning a Toyota.  I have spoken with a number of mechanics and car owners, and I have come to trust the Toyota name.  When I am ready to replace my Corolla with a larger vehicle, I will definitely stick to Toyota.<br><br>
