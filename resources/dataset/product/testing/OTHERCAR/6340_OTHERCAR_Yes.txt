              Currently owning three BMW's (and having owned 5 others before), the "feel" of a quality product was not lost on me. 
  Three years ago I purchased my C230 (a lease return) with 44,000 miles registered on the odometer.  Considering it was an investment in an unknown driver's treatment, I also purchased a 50,000 mile extended power train warranty.
  Since that time I've spent approximately $250 in repairs (two warranty claims) and $300 in "service" (fluid changes, light bulbs, wear items like brake pads, and adjustments) - with one set of replacement tires at 60,000 miles.
  The elegance of the W202 chassis C230 mechanical design allows for an ease of service / repair not found on other German cars, and definately not on the past Japanese, British, Italian, or American cars I've owned.  That elegance makes service within the grasp of novice mechanics.
  The two warranty claims were for a fuel pump (newer pressurized fuel injection systems live longer when they do not have to deal with less full tanks) and a transmission.  The transmission failed to shift properly after about 91,000 miles.  A service bulliten was applied by the transmission technician, and the unit behaves better than ever.  My deductable cost for those two repairs was $100.
  The W202 C230 is a lux-touring car.  That must be kept in mind during any discussions.  An Interstate Highway "mile-eater" it regularly returns 29-30 mpg on the highway and 26-29 around town.  While the seats are a bit more firm than found on other cars (my weight hovers around a light 140 pounds), their value becomes evident on drives of over 500 miles.  The fit and quality of the leather still remains something to behold after almost 100,000 miles.  The two position seat heaters are better suited to real world changes in temperature than others I have experienced.  The leather steering wheel has a "feel" second to none.
  Handling is exactly what one should expect from a lux-touring car.  I can easily keep up with my wife's 325is BMW through winding roads - if thought is given to "setting up" both car and suspension for the road ahead. At the end of such drives I am far less tired than times with any of my BMW's.  The traction control is well mannered and another value when driving on slick pavement.
  Controls a well laid out for the driver, as would be found in most well bred European cars.  Their biggest drawback is having the CD changer mounted in the trunk, rather than being accessable from inside the car.
  Lights, including fog lamps, are more than adequate for both city and country driving.  The headlight washers in tandum with their own wipers are a true safety feature that now seems lost on the US market.
  The overall look of understated elegance and style are pleasing to the eye.  The fit of all body panels is without flaw.  It looks like a Mercedes-Benz should look.
  The big four engine is deceving.  After my initial test drive I had to open the hood and verify that it wasn't a six!  During any sane example of driving it has adequate power: from stoplight accelerations to illegal 120  driving.  The only drawback is a tendency to get "light" above 90 mph.  But for those speeds one should consider a less comfortable Japanese or German car.
  The interior easily accomodates five reasonable sized Americans, and the climate control system keeps all comfortable.
  I have seen some "base" models and would suggest keeping a good distance from them.  To enjoy these cars they need all the "options" that were designed for them.  The cost would still be well below that of a less comfortable Toyota or Honda (and in most cases, a BMW).
  All in all, within the expected design envelope of the C230 it is a joy to own and drive.  Make sure you want quality and lux-living before considering this one over an econo-box you may be used to - or the budget racer down the block.
  There have been few service bullitins and no recalls that I know of.
