            We bought our first 1996 Chevy Blazer in 1998. It had low miles, and we got a good deal on it, however, it came with many problems. Within the first month, we had to take it back three times to have the CD player worked on. It would lose volume and then not work at all. After that the windshield wipers stopped working. It was a hit-or-miss thing. You never knew when they would work or not. These didn't get repaired properly either. 

We decided to trade that Blazer in for a newer model thinking that it was just a fluke. Well...we got a 1998 Chevy Blazer in 1999. This vehicle was much worse than the first. The electric windows and doorlocks constantly were going out. We took this in over 6 times in 6 months to be repaired. The battery was leaking acid, and we had to replace that. We needed to get a new converter for the truck which was going to cost over $1500 to replace. Right after that, the transmission starting acting up, and we were going to have to replace that also. This is all on a vehicle that only had 35,000 miles on it!

My husband had bought the Blazer for me so that I would have a reliable vehicle to drive the kids around in. After all of these problems, we opted to buy a new 2000 Chevy Venture which has been great so far. I loved the way the Blazer drove, but didn't like all of the problems that came with the two we had. Also, if you have kids, two carseats take up the whole backseat. We could never have an extra person ride with us, because there wasn't enough room for them to sit. We don't have this problem now with the van.

Overall, our experience with the Blazer was very poor. I've heard many people who have had great experiences with their Blazer so it could just be a fluke that we got two bad ones.
