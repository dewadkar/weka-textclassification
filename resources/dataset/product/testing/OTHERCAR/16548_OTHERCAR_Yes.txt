            I recently purchased a used 1992 Nissan 240sx Coupe from a local dealer here in Baton Rouge, La. for my 21 year old daughter for school. At first, I was a bit apprehensive about buying a &quot;sports&quot; car for a youngster however, the Nissan name made it a bit easier. I already own an 1989 Nissan Maxima GXE that is fun to drive. So, I was hooked somewhat. The 240 had 128k miles on it but it looks and runs good. Also, everything works well. I love this car and my daughter does too. It rides smooth and handles well. I don't like the cramped quarters of the back seat. No one should ever be subjected to having to sit back there, child or adult! Although, this is the car for young people on the go. It's a college students run around car that older folks could get use too.  Finally, I must admit, I enjoy driving it as much as my daughter does... <br><br>
