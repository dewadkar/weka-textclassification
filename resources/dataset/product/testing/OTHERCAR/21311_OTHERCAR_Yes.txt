            Friend's of mine have a Toyota Camry LE.I have driven this car a couple of time's.What I have noticed about this car is that it offer's a lot of feature's.This car has cruise control,airbags on both the passenger and drive side and power locks and windows.The car seats are so comfortable it comes in handy on long road trips.You can recline the seat's back and relax.

The Toyota Camry LE is also good on gas mileage and is very dependable.It is also a smooth ride no matter where you go in this vehicle.We have went down some bumpy roads and it not even bother me.These are some of the things I have notice about the Toyota Camry LE.So,if you are in the market for a dependable,good on gas,smooth ride,comfortable seat car with an option to have a cd player or a am/fm cassette player car I suggest you look at the Toyota Camry LE at your local Toyota Dealer.<br><br>
