            It seemed like a good value when I bought it.  It was only $4300 at a auction for a car that was only 3 years old with 66,000 miles.  It had most of the features I wanted, but did not have cruise control.  

The problems started weeks after I bought it.  I had to replace the alternator.  I replaced the alternator 5 times before I got rid of it.  I had to replace the alternator on average at every oil change.  Most people have some sort of spare tire with their car.  With this car I had a spare alternator.  

At 70,000 miles the head gasket blew.  The brakes needed to be replaced every other oil change.  The transmission made a huge clunk when downshifting, and was about to go out when I sold it.  At 75MPH it was constantly switching gears.  

I did like the fact that it had anti-lock brakes, but the brakes were horrid for durability.  I had to replace the brakes every other oil change.  Twice I was in the middle of nowhere and my brakes give up and I had to have the car towed.  

The four cylinder really sucked.  It's ok in the city, and can attain freeway speeds, but forget about hills and passing with this car. I now have a 1996 Nissan Altima that has the same size engine as this, but has 40 HP more than the Corsica and have never had any problems with it.  

The paint really sucked.  It was constantly peeling and flaking.  Paint should not be doing this on a car that is only a few years old.  Stuff in the interior was always breaking and falling off.  

In total the car stranded me 7 times.  I took care of this care and it did not take care of me.  I did all the regular maintance, and this still happened.  I don't think it is too much to ask to have a car go 100,000 miles before major repairs or to have the alternator last more than one oil change or to have the brakes last longer than 6,000 miles.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  There is a reason that the initial price of this car is so low-the quality sucks.  <br><br>
