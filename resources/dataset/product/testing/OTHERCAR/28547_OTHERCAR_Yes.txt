            This review is my submission to the write-off in honor of my friend, Roadiem, who was otherwise known to his friends, family and all who loved him as Michael J. Lambert. Those of you who knew Roadiem know that his passions were  automobiles, photography and music--he was an expert in the automotive section here at Epinions, and he took great pride in posting his beautiful and unique photographs on the internet. He loved his music, too, particularly the blues, and he put me on to some really great music during our all-too-brief friendship. His greatest love was his family-- he spoke often of his lovely wife Chris and his daughters, and I can say with certainty that Mike was a great husband and father, and I know that he will be sorely missed by his loved ones. 

I want to thank Scott Ward, who most of you will know as Wolfman309, for creating this write-off. Scott was a close friend to Roadiem, and he has worked tirelessly to put this event together. Scott is also in the process of having a bank account set up for donations to Mike's family to help them in this most difficult time. I would urge everyone to find it in their heart to contribute to this fund--it is indeed a very worthy cause.

Now, without further ado, here is my review of my 2000 Jeep Wrangler (in the form of a letter to my friend, Roadiem):

Hey Roadie!!!

Guess what? I just bought a new vehicle! Yeah, I decided to get rid of that troublesome Jaguar XJ-6 that I had and get a real machine! I wish that I had time to consult with you before I bought it, but it seems that you had an appointment with your Maker that couldn't be avoided. I don't really understand why you had to go, but it was God's will, and all of us have to live with that. Perhaps someday His ways will be revealed to us, but for now, I guess I just have to accept your passing and have faith that all is well with you.

Back to the vehicle--it's a 2000 Jeep Wrangler. I bought it new and got a pretty good deal on it because it was leftover inventory. I knew you'd approve of that--saving a buck is something we both had in common! My Jeep is white with a black rag top and black trim--really a pretty classy looking vehicle, if I do say so myself. It has black carpet and cloth seats that sort of add to the look, and I'm sure that you would like the way this machine looks.

It comes equipped with a 4 cylinder 2.5 liter engine--I know, you would prefer something with a little more power, but it serves my purposes well. Remember, it doesn't snow down here in Tennessee like it does in Michigan, so I really don't need the extra power--I pretty much creep along anyway. I do have 4 wheel drive, though, so I can make it in those infrequent occasions when it does ice up down here.

My Jeep is equipped with an automatic transmission, air conditioning, and a really good heater. Yeah, Roadie, I know that the automatic transmission and air conditioning are sort of a cop out, but it does get real hot here in Tennessee, so I do need the air conditioner. Heck, Roadie, I'm getting old and it's troublesome to shift gears with a manual transmission, so the automatic transmission is really a convenience--you will forgive me that one indulgence, won't you old buddy? I know that you will.

What you would dig about this machine is the sound system--there are speakers in the front and in the roll bar on top--you mix the sound just right and you can hear that Susan Tedeschi, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Jonny Lang and Creed that you so often raved about like you never heard it before. The AM/FM radio and cassette player really delivers the goods in the sound department.

The gas mileage leaves a little to be desired, but I guess I can live with it. My Jeep handles real good--it's tight and responsive and I can travel those roads down by the river that I promised I'd show you with ease. Putting the top down would have been an extra bonus--we could have had a ball driving those roads this summer with the blues blasting out from the speakers!

The only thing I don't like about this vehicle is the ride--it can be a little stiff and bumpy at times. I was counting on you  to give me some tips about improving the suspension, but you had to leave us way too soon.

Overall, I really like this vehicle, Roadie--I think you would, too. I just wish you were here so I could take you for a spin in it!

Enough about the vehicle--I want you to know that those nights when you and I and Wolfman309 had those chats on Yahoo Messenger back in the winter were some of the most fun times in my life. I'm laughing right now when I remember complaining to you guys that it was 20 degrees here in Tennessee, and I was freezing my butt off--you told me it was -20 there in Michigan with snow 6 feet deep, and that what I was experiencing was a heat wave! If I remember correctly, you even said that if you were in Tennessee, you'd be wearing shorts and a tee shirt in that kind of weather--I believed you, too!

Know this, Roadie--I'll never forget you. You were a bright spot in my life and my friendship with you was really something special. I'll miss the times we could have had and the music we could have listened to together, but it just wasn't meant to be. 

I love you, my friend--rest well.

Your friend,

Mike
