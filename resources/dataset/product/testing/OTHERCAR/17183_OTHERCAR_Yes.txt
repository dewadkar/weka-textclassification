            When we decided we needed a new car in 1997, we began to narrow down our list.  DH wanted a pick-up truck with a full-size extended cab.  I wanted a MAXIMA.  Well, so did he, but we'd just decided to sell our Ford Bronco II, so he was stuck in a truck mode!

He began the process of looking for a new car the way he knows how - EXTENSIVE SHOPPING (my DH cannot impulse shop if his life depended on it!).  He began seeing the Maxima everywhere, and this prompted him to search Consumer Reports, Nissan's website, Car and Driver, Motor Trend.

The day finally came when we took our (then) two sons with us on a Sunday to the Nissan lots.  We saw cars that we liked, and noted what accessories came with which model.

We narrowed down our search, and made a trip to Bommarito Nissan in North St. Louis county.  We found a 4-door 1997 Maxima SE, manual transmission, in black.  We took it for a test drive, and came back to negotiate price.  We knew that what the Dealership paid for the car, and knew about how much we could afford a month, so the negotiation was more &quot;Do we trade-in the truck or do we try to sell it outright(which we did)&quot;.  

Financing was easy, and bargaining for an upgraded Bose Stereo System took some doing.

Overall, we are very pleased with our Maxima.  She's quick, the shifting is smooth, the interior is pleasing and comfortable.  The back seat can comfortably seat our three children (one in a car seat), or two adults.  We've even put two adults in the back with the car seat!  

The air-conditioner blows hard, and cools quickly.  The heat is very hot, and takes no time at all to warm the whole car.  We also have a moon-roof that opens all the way back, or vents from the rear.  Rear-defrost keeps our back window clean and free of fog, ice and snow.  Long drives are not a problem - there is lumbar support for the driver.

There is a pass-through from the back seat to the trunk.  The trunk is fairly large, though not as large as some others in its class.  But, we're a family of five, and the trunk is large enough for us to pack for a weekend.

She gets roughly 18-22 mpg on the highway, and has to use premium gasoline (per the manufacturer).  Lately we've had to keep our little rocket in the garage, as the gas prices are too high for us to waste fuel.  

The first couple of months we had the Maxima, we noticed paint chips on the hood.  We bought a bra right away, but were disappointed that the paint would still be so soft to allow that many chips right away.  

Overall, we love our little sports sedan, and recommend one to anyone who is looking for something for the family, but still offers some excitement while driving!
