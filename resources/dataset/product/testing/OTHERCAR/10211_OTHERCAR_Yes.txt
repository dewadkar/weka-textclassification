            When you are looking for a car in this catgory you find yourself visiting the Lexus and MB showrooms. I did both and eventually settled on the Lexus, though our second car is a Mercedes C class that has performed more than satisfactorily for the past 3 years. We had placed a $1000 deposit in anticipation of taking delivery on one of the first M Class vehicles to be delivered to our area. However, when we were called to schedule delivery, I was somewhat hesitant based on reported startup problems with early models. I decided the prudent thing to do was to wait out the problem phase. In the interim I visited the local Lexus dealer, drove the RX 3oo, was enchanted by the level of customer support and was therefore torn between purchasing this car vs the long awaited MB.I returned to test the Lexus a second time and was sold on the ride, the comfort and the extras that were standard. This SUV has the feel and the comfort of a standard luxury car combined with the roominess of a small van. The rear seats fold effortlessly down to make an area that easily accomodated two sets of golf clubs plus all the clothes, food, and other necessities for an extended golf trip to the south. On the road the biggest problem is keeping the vehicle within speed limits as the powerplant provides more than ample power for passing and cruise. My wife, who is 5'2&quot; has fallen completely in love with the elevated seating and loves to drive. This is in sharp contrast to my previous minivan, a Ford Aerostar, which she did not feel comfortable driving.. Support is exceptional. When you go in for service expect to get several followups to ensure your satisfaction. Call to schedule major service and our dealer will come to your home to collect the car and leave you a Lexus to drive while the work is being done. All this does not come cheap with a sticker in the $36-40k range. We have decided that the price is worth it...<br><br>
