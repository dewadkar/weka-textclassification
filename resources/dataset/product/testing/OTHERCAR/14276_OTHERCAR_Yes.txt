            The 323 is on great little car ( the 121 is smaller still ) and it has some good awards from all over the planet. But let me tell something about it that many might not have thought about. 

Once there was a guy named Steve, he worked at a shop called A-SPEC and one day he was messing around with the parts that were on the floor and something briliant sparked .... the parts from the 323 and the 626 are somewhat similar, why not give it a try and see what happens.

Couple of hours after tinkering around Steve put a 2.5L V-6 Mazda MX-6 motor in a 323 without any welding or modifing the cars body at all. The conversion was as simple as removing the old mounts, bolting the new mounts in and droping the engine right in that little space that the 323 provided. he went further with this by putting the MX-6 front and back suspension in the 323, then he liked the black lather interior of the 25th Aneversary Edition of the Mazda MX-3 GS so he stuck that in there too.

Not long after the car was taken to the local drag strip and he was able to post an incredible 14.3s 1/4 times and all this was done with a stock Mazda KL series MX-6 motor. The estimated HP on it is not more then 170.
