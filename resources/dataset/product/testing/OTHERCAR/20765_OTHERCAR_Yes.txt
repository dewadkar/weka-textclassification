            I purchased my 1990 CRX nearly 2 years ago from my uncle's neighbor.  It had been sitting in his back yard for some indeterminate ammount of time.  It needed a new windsheild, fender, turn signals, battery, and exhaust components-  but for only $425 for a 1990 CRX what do you expect?  Mainly I bought it because the price was right and because it is a Honda.  

I really appreciate the reliability.  I turn the key and it goes.  It is the normal (DX) model and gets 38-44 mpg.  I am quite pleased with that since it has 174,000 miles on it so far.  I see no reason why it shouldn't last at least as long as my 1981 civic which I sold last year at 238,000 miles.  

It handles quite well, but not as well as the ol' beater porsche that I used to have.  

For a tiny car there is a lot of room inside.  I am 6' tall and I fit inside easily.  With the seat all the way back the pedals are a bit too far away.  The leg room is impressive.  

The only thing that I dislike about it is that it makes my back hurt after long drives.  The seats are really hard.  

It is easy to drive.  I usually skip a few gears while shifting-  who really needs second and fourth anyway?  I suppose that some people feel a terrible need for speed and need to accelerate quickly but I am content to continue down the road in a leisurly manner.  Don't get me wrong though, I do travel a bit fast on the highway.  The car goes at least 103mph, probably faster.  

I suppose that it is a good car for anyone without kids.  (no room for them)  Aside from needing the timing belt changed (difficult for DIYers)  it is a great little low maintennance vehicle.  I can even fit all of my camping gear into it and a mountain bike.  It is a bit more difficult to fit skis inside since they tend to protrude into the passenger side although it is possible to fit 2 pair and 2 people inside without too much trouble.  No squeaks or rattles.  

Would I buy this car again if given the opportunity?  Without hesitation.  <br><br>
