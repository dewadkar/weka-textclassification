            The chrysler Lebaron is a once K-car now good affordable convertible.  I got a 1992lebaron convertible for my senior year of high school and I loved it ever since.  The baron is a convertible with power and style while still saving on the wallet.  It can be good for a single person or a small family who just wants an all round fun car. 

The chrysler lebaron convertible started as a K-car of the eighties and slowly became a unique looking sport convertible with many options and sold the most from around 1989 to 1995 when it was discontinued.  The J-body style like mine was from 1987 to 1995 with some interior/exterior changes along the way.  along with that it had 4 cylinders(base and turbo) and a V-6.  Automatic transmissions were mainly standard even though a manual was an option.

My Lebaorn was a 1992 Baron LX with all the options except leather.  It had a Mitsubishi/chrysler 3.0 Litre v-6 with 141 horsepower and a 4-speed automatic/OD transmission so it could get up and go.  It had enough power to keep up with a Chevy cavalier Z24 neck to neck.  It was fun in the summer a power-top makes everything easier, press the button and fell the breeze.

The car did have its share of problems, but only a few. At 55,000 miles a new top was needed, cost: $350.00  At about 80,000miles the exaust needed to be replaced, cost: $350.00.  At 95,000 Miles a heater core was needed when the old one exploded causing antifreeze to go on the floor, cost: $400.00.  And at 100,000 Miles I had a complete tune-up and all fluids replaced, cost $160.00.  But for a car that cost $6000.00 to get 140,000 Miles and it is still going that is a good price for standard repairs.

The engine can be the best part.  The engine is designed similar to the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 twin turbo engine that puts out 320 horsepower.  So you can twin turbo your engine to produce alot of power.
