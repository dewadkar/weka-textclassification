            2001 Toyota Sienna The 2001 Sienna is a 4-door, 7-passenger minivan available in three trims, ranging from the CE to the XLE. 
Upon introduction, all trims are equipped with a standard 3.0-liter, V6, 210-horsepower engine that consumes 19-mpg in the city and 24-mpg on the highway. An electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive is standard. 

The 2001 Sienna is a carryover from 2000. Toyota has always tried to come out with cost efficient vehicles to compete in the market.  I canï¿½t understand why their only line of minivans would retail for $26,000. 
Sure it is a nice van, but is it nearly worth that amount.
