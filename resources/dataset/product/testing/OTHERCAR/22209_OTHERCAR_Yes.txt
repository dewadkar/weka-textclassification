            The Axiom is a unique vehicle in a market flooded with SUV's of all shapes, sizes, and capabilities.  During the evolution of the "SUV," the market trend changed from real trucks with true utility (high payload capacity, towing ability, real 4WD ...)  to a growing trend of "water-downed" car-based SUV's with, in general, limited utility.  The reason for this is clear and practical, a majority of SUV buyers want a vehicle with perceived utility even though they really didn't need it.  Because of this, many manufacturers of truck based SUV's have tried to create vehicles that will ride and handle like a car without compromising what the vehicle was actually designed for.  

This seems to be what Isuzu had in mind when they designed that Axiom.  The Axiom is a truck-based SUV so it has a high towing capacity (without the need of additional equipment like many car-based vehicles), a real AWD/4WD system, and because of its rugged truck frame will last for many years under punishing conditions.  In short, "utility" in SUV still applies for the Axiom.  To make it more carlike, Isuzu added intelligent suspension control (ISC) which offers both comfort (car-like ride) and sport (truck-like ride) to allow the driver to change the suspension depending on how the Axiom is being used.  Isuzu figured the Axiom would be used more on city streets than offroad so they lowered the Axiom's profile slightly to improve handling.  Although this appears to limit the Axiom's offroad ability, many truck magazines have remarked that the Axiom surprised them because it was able to tackle their offroad coarses with little effort.

When I was shopping for an SUV last year, I wanted a real truck for ruggedness and a rear wheel drive biased AWD/4WD system to get me to the ski slopes and back.  My choices came down to the Montero Sport, Trailblazer, 4Runner and the Axiom.  The Axiom, in my opinion, had the best AWD system at the time, best warranty (10 year 120,000 miles) best financing (0% for 5 years), and lowest price for comparably equipped vehicles.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

The Torque on Demand (TOD)the Axiom offers is a "proactive" AWD system that can be used under any road conditions.  This type of system is better than many of the "reactive" systems that sends power to wheels with traction after the drive wheels slip.  Instead, the Axiom always sends at least 15% to the front wheels and automatically transfers power before loss of tractions occurs.  The system has worked perfectly on several trips to the mountains last year.  In addition, the TOD system still offers low range 4WD for true offroading conditions.  Many reviewers conclude that the TOD system offers the best of both AWD and 4WD worlds.

The 3.5 L engine is perfect for this size of vehicle.  The Axiom is quick off the line and has plenty of reserve power for safe passing on two lane highways.  The Axiom is also fairly efficient for its size, weight, and engine.  I average around 21 mpg on the highway and 15 city.

The Axiom rides fairly well despite being a truck.  The two suspension modes definitely do a good job for controlling the dynamics of the vehicle.  It is smooth as can be on freeways but can get a little bumpy, even in comfort mode, on rougher roads.  On twisty two lane mountain roads, the Axiom handles very well when placed in sport mode.  On several long trips, I have often remarked how well the Axiom handles various types of trips.  It is one versatile vehicle.

Passenger space is generous and adults fit comfortably in the rear seats even with the front seats moved all the way back.  In addition, the rear seat backs offer three different recline positions for the passengers.  The front seats are comfortable, but the driver seat would benefit with more leg room and a height adjustment.  I am 6'3" and fit well in the Axiom, but my fiance is 5'5" and she needs to sit on a pillow to see over hood because the lack of height adjustment.

Since I purchased it I have only had one major complaint, which luckily, I have remedied.  Because Isuzu wanted to make it more carlike, they used fairly soft springs on the Axiom.  With just two people, the Axiom handles beautifully and feels extremely stable.  Once it is loaded with gear or 4 adults, the soft springs make for a very uncomfortable ride under certain road conditions.  Over rough roads, the soft rear springs allow the Axiom to bottom out often, even in the sport suspension mode.  To remedy this behavior, I installed an aftermarket air suspension kit (less than $200) that allows me to inflate or deflate air bladders to increase or decrease the stiffness of the suspension depending on the load while I am driving.  Now I can fine tune the suspension and it has never bottomed out since. The handling of the Axiom is now the same under load as it was empty.  I would recommend this upgrade to anyone who purchases an Axiom.

All in all, I am just as happy with the Axiom today as I was when I drove it off the lot almost a year ago.  The Axiom offers a lot of bang for your buck and also offers an exciting design in a sea of bland vehicles.
