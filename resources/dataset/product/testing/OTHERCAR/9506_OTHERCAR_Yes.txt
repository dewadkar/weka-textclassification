            If your looking for a truck that will last a long time under heavy use, and be nice enough to take out to the dance. The Dodge Laramie SLT Extended Cab is the one for you. 

On the inside you will feel like your driving a Luxury Car with all the appointments. The interior is spacious and functional with all controls with-in easy reach ( I should know I'm only 4 ft. 11 in. tall) and are well illuminated . The seats are designed to support your back and they feel like a well made sofa.  The extended cab has room three in the rear and three in the front, the back doors only open when a front door is open ( so no escaping children). The rear door handle is in the opening not on the outside, that leaves a nice clean line on the outside of the truck. 

Now to the fun part, with the 318 V8 you can tow up to a 4 horse stock trailer like it's not there. I've driven the V-10 and that's even better.
Being a Country Woman I can really appreciate a truck that works as hard as I do. And I do work hard I train and haul horse's all around the country, I have owned a number of trucks including Ford and Chevy , but when I comes to being comfortable and capable the Dodge Ram has it hands down.
