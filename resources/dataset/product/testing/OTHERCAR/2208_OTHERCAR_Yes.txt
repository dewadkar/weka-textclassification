            Pros: Best handling car I have ever driven. There is a reason Car & Driver rated this the best handling car under $30,000, and 4th best handling car at ANY price. This car takes 25mph turns at 90 as though it were on railroad tracks and needs to go faster. This is amazing for any auto, but on a front wheel drive vehicle, it is astounding. The engine is impressive, although there are certainly more powerful engines available for straight-away power. However, it is one of the most entertaining engines I have driven. A Porsche Boxster engine has nothing on the torque curve of this car. Fun to drive factor, this car gets a ten. When considering this for purchase I considered an Intregra Type R, BMW Z3, Honda S2000, Toyota Celica, Porsche Boxster, a used Acura NSX, and a used 911 Targa. The Prelude won easily due to it's superiority in handling and cost. Admitedly, the S2000 might have won, were it not for the fact that I could not buy one for under $40,000.

Cons: The styling is Honda-boring. I have never gotten used to the headlights on this vehicle. Could have used the start button from the S2000 to liven up the interior even a little, or a six speed manual. And the gas mileage, although good, is not quite as impressive as I expected, averaging in the neighborhood of 25mpg.

Bottom Line: For a practical sports car under $30,000 both the "experts" and I agree, there is no question that the Prelude SH is the best choice. For the best handling front wheel drive car ever manufactured at any price, this car is still the best choice.
