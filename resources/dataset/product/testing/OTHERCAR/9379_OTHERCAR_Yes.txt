            The Toyota Tercel is, or actually was, one of the better cars out there on the market. I was attracted to it not becuase of it's price, but also becuase of the reputation for reliability that Toyota has. I bought mine in 1996, and I have never had the slightest problem with it - and I've driven to many a place! The car now has about 50,000 miles on it (in 3 years!) and is still going strong. I have to reccommend it as a used car for anyone thinking of purchasing it - as it can take a lot of punishment without blinking an eye.The only thing to look out for is your size - I'm 5'2, so I love little cars (they give me control!), but for anyone taller than about 5'5 the car is a little on the small side. It was my first new car, and I could park it anywhere because of its size. <br><br>
