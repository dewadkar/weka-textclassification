            I would buy another SSEI. This model has an excellent design. It is powerful and acceleration is excellent. On a recent trip thru the mountains, I averaged 28.46 MPG. On high speed 75 to 80 miles cruising, I have averaged 30 MPG. The main feature that made me buy this car was the heads up display, Bose stereo, Magna-steer, power with economy, and body work. I live at 5000 ft. above sea level and the supercharger supplies terrific power to pass, climb mountains, and the transmission allows almost free whelling on the downhill grades. The handling is excellent on curvy mountain roads. This car lived up to all of my expectations, as I had previously owned European type sports cars. The space and seating in this car are superior to European type sports sedans while offering you the feel of a sports car. The SSEI could use some improvements i.e. shorter turn radius and better breaking. <br><br>
