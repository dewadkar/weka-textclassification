            Car shopping.  What a nightmare it can be!  You all know what I am talking about...so many choices, so many colors, and for the attached buyer so many different tastes to choose from!  

My husband and I shopped around for about a year before we bought our 1997 Cavalier Rally Sport Coupe.  I had always wanted one, he had previously owned one.  It seems obvious now that we bought one then!  I liked the blue, he liked the green.  We ended up with the green because it looked sportier and had a 2.9% interest rate.  I can sacrifice color for money, especially for a brand new car!

The Cavalier has been very reliable for us.  We had a few minor issues from the start that were taken care of promptly.  First our ignition key would only go in one way and would not unlock both doors.  No problem, just get a new key.  Then on the way from the car lot the check engine light comes on and stays on.  At our trip back to the dealership we hear that is a common problem with Cavalier's, a bit of glitch with the fuse but nothing to worry about.  We get that fixed under warranty of course.  Next is the recall for the airbag.  Around this same time the horn stops working, and the cd player no longer plays and will not release the cd.  Somehow my battery dies and magically the cd player works again but still no horn.  The horn was fixed when I had the airbag recall taken care of, being told that it was a faulty fuse.  Under warranty of course.  The car has also had a few cosmetic issues, the back seat seat belt covers on the ceiling both broke and fell off.  The front passenger seat spring popped out, my husband was able to fix it after the dealer told us it would be at least $75.00 for repair, maybe more if a new seat was needed.   Now it is going back in for another recall on the engine.  Seems that a valve does not like the salt on the roads in the winter time.  Of course they say this will be taken of for us.

Now the GOOD STUFF about the car!  
I love driving it!  It is so easy to maneuver and handle.  I can whip it in and out of spaces everywhere and is a breeze to parallel park.  Excellent get up and go and a smooth ride.  The factory speakers and cd player are decent, with a built in volume control for stopping and not getting blasted by music that is too loud!  Come on..we all know we have done that at least once!  The car also seems to handle well at higher speeds. During the winter I found that I really liked the front wheel drive and anti lock brakes.  We do quite a bit of interstate driving and it holds up very well.  The sporty look also held major appeal.  We drove it on a recent car trip and it was very comfortable.  The seats do recline, making napping and stretching easy.  Gas mileage was excellent. The car now has about 70,000 miles and it is still great to drive.  

Now the NOT SO GOOD STUFF about the car!
The sport coupe is not car seat friendly!  The seats do move forward, but not quite far enough.  The metal seems to dent easily as well, almost with a crumple effect.  We recently had a hail storm and my car shows that it took a beating while another car parked next to it barely has a ding.  The paint at the key hole seems to flake and chip easily as well, needing to retouched every few months to avoid rusting.  Two recalls so far, both of them on important aspects of the vehicle, the airbag and the engine.  However, I must say that Chevrolet has taken care of the problems.

All in all, I am glad we bought the Cavalier.  It has proved itself over and over again.  It was a reasonable price, gave us the sporty look we wanted and keeps coming back to take us around the block once again!  (knock on wood of course!)
