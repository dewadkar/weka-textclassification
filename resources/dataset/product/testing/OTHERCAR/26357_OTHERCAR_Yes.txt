            Imagine this... cruising along the Top of the World Highway in Alaska, the late summer sun streaming through your sun roof with the cool but not cold Alaskan air. My family's 1999 GMC Jimmy did just that last year when my parents took it on a 9,000 mile trip from Wisconsin to Alaska and back.

The 4WD, 4 door Jimmy performed marvelously, averaging 18 to 19 mpg on the trip. The vehicle is a work of pure SUV style, without feeling at all like a gangly truck. Power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, automatic climate controls, power sunroof, cruise control and a Bose sound system, combined with 8-way powered leather seats make the Jimmy far above most other SUV in the intermediate class. Extra bonuses include heated outside mirrors, self dimming rear view and outside left mirrors, and compass and thermometer set above the rear view mirror.

There's plenty of shoulder room with 4 adults riding in the Jimmy, though leg room in the back seat can be tight for long-legged travellers. A fifth person can fit in the middle of the reat seat, though that does tend to give hips and shoulders a bit of a squeeze.

Though our Jimmy has made the 9,000 mile Alaskan trip, a couple of trips to Virginia, Kansas, and Florida (all from Wisconsin), it has not had any trips for repair in all of it's 30,000 miles. My family tends to drive vehicles hard, logging in tens of thousands of miles each year, so having a dependable vehicle is a must.

My dad loves to fish, so many of the trips are made towing a fishing boat behind the Jimmy. It's 190 horsepower engine has enough &quot;umph&quot; to tow either his antique Dunphy or his new Lund. Handling the Jimmy doesn't change much even towing those loads.

The dual-entry tail is handy too. Flip the glass window up to access things quickly or bring up the whole tail unit to stow and retrieve larger objects stored in the back. And if you run out of room, there's always the luggage rack on top.

There's everything to love about the Jimmy... from the smooth quiet ride to the rugged capability of its power. I admit, the pricing for the luxury package puts the Jimmy into a higher price range... far above SUVs like the Kia Sportage and the Toyota RAV4, but we all know that you have to pay for luxury and quality.

Size-wise, the Jimmy is between the Toyota RAV4 and the Ford Explorer. This was one of the reasons our family bought a Jimmy... we wanted a bit more room than I have in my RAV4 but didn't want to feel as though we were driving a monster. The Jimmy has met our requirement there.

If you want a mid-sized SUV that ride and handles easily, without the thump and bump of many SUVs and trucks, you should give the Jimmy a try. There is room in the rear seat for two child safety seats and would comfortably fit 3 children for a long trip. As I mentioned previously, it will also handle 4 adults comfortably for trips up to 1,000 miles, and I know it became home to my parents' tushes for their 9,000 mile trek (incidentally, the front seats also have adjustable lumbar support).

In a year, when I trade in my Toyota RAV4, I will likely be replacing it with the larger Jimmy... that is unless I become captivated by the Toyota 4-Runner in the meantime. Last time I checked, the 4-Runner had a slightly louder ride than the Jimmy and the price was also higher. In the meantime, I'll continue to hop into the family Jimmy whenever I can win the coin toss for it.<br><br>
