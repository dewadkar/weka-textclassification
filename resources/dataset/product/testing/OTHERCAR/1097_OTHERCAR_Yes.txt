            I bought my 2002 Kia Rio on November 20, 2001, so I've had it for almost 4 months, and I absolutely love it except for a few minor details, my hood doesn't line up with the rest of the body, and it took 3 different dealers and 2 calls to Kia Canada to get it fixed (hinges were not installed straight)  There are a lot of Kia Rio's out there with this problem, because the first 2 dealerships told me it was normal for the hood to be like this.

One other option that I really would have loved on this vehicle is a folding down rear seat.  would have loved the extra cargo space (not available on rio RS)

Everything else about this car is great, I'm getting wonderful mileage (35 mpg city, 40 hwy) although I have to fill up pretty often, its a pretty small gas tank, and its difficult to fill the top portion of the tank (apparently its a safety feature that causes the back splashing gas).  Its surprisingly roomy for a small car, I've only had 3 people in it at one time so far (wouldn't try to fit 5 in it).  The truck is huge, very roomy, never would have expected it. Handling is good, although a little bumpy (but not as bumpy as the toyota Echo, and handles much better)  I really hope this car is reliable over the long term.
