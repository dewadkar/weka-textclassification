            I really like this camera, because it is very easy to use. There is a flash button, a window to see through, a screen to see on, a double flash to avoid red eyes, and more. 

Another reason why I like this camera is because instead of buying film every single time you run out and instead of having to bring them to a store to be developed, you can but these memory disks that can hold up to 250 pictures on each disk. You can also hook the camera or just put the disk in the computer to view the pictures. Then when you run out of space on the disk, upload all the pictures to the computer, then delete them on the disk and keep doing that over and over again. 

If you want to get them printed, don't waste your time, money, and ink on your printer trying to print them, they will turn out really bad and not worth it. Upload them to www.shutterfly.com and order them from there. They will print them like they were normal pictures being developed and will send them to you or anywhere you want.

I would say to buy this camera even though it is quite expensive. It is worth it.
