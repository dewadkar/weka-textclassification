            I have been a longtime fan of all wheel drive; they are the only cars I have driven since 1984.  When my trusty Toyota Camry AllTrac started showing too much rust, I decided to see what Audi had to offer (since Toyota no longer makes an all wheel drive sedan).  I really did not plan on buying a new car, but I absolutely fell in love with the A4 Quattro with the 2.8 liter engine during the test drive.  I ended up buying the one I test drove; one with a manual 5 speed transmission and all the extras (sport package, sunroof, Bose stereo with CD changer).

The car is a champ.  Its acceleration is very good (in my untrained opinion) and its stability on the road is amazing.  I was once going down the interstate at 65 and a piece of debris fell of a truck in front of me.  I quickly changed lanes to avoid the debris, then moved back into my lane.  The handling was precise throughout this emergency maneuver.

There have been a few minor glitches.  The wood trim on the ash tray is not properly connected.  Also, the LEDs on the radio sometime do not give a proper display.  The dealer has told me that these problems will be fixed when it comes in for its first periodic maintenance visit.  Oh, the first three years of standard periodic maintenance are on Audi...such a deal.

The most serious problem is with the driver's seat.  I have had a devil of a time finding a comfortable setting.  The cushions on the seat back form a curve in the wrong direction; I can support my lower back or my upper back, but not both at the same time.  This makes for painful driving after a half hour or so.  I am experimenting with some more dramatic changes in the seat position (in fact, it seems that the seat was positioned at some extreme ends of its arc of adjustment; when I get it into a more normal position, hopefully it will be more comfortable...otherwise I will need to get an aftermarket seat back).

I ended up keeping my old Camry (thank God, it gets 30 mpg whereas the A4 gets about 23 mpg and the A4 requires premium grade gasoline...it can cost $25 to fill it at the current ridiculous prices) and switching back and forth allows me to continue to appreciate the excellent features of the A4.  After a while, we get used to the good points and begin to ignore them.  After six months of switching back and forth, I still get a thrill every time I get in and drive it.

My brother bought a new Saab the same week I got my A4.  He got his with an automatic transmission.  I let him drive my A4 and he immediately began missing the fun of a standard shift.  The Saab is a nice car to drive; but it is still just a car.  Driving the Audi is great fun, even if you are just heading to Krogers to get some milk.  I also like the envious looks I get from pedestrians and drivers of other cars.  Oddly enough, everyone tells me how popular this car is, but I rarely see them on the road.<br><br>
