            We bought our Mazda MPV in 1990, 10 years ago! We loved the design, and the room inside, it sits 7 people and our family pet, very comfortably. Also, the different seating and storage configurations available by folding or removing seats is a great added bonus! We have hauled baseball teams, lumber, patio pavers, you name it! The automatic leveler feature has been outstanding and has saved wear and tear on our vehicle and tires. With air conditioning in front and a separate air control in the back it has been perfect for long trips or picking up kids on hot days. I do not have to freeze to get them cooled off. The kids can turn the air up high in back and I can have it on low in front. 

With the MPV, the driver sits higher than other similar vehicles and it feels more like your driving a truck, although the comfort is great and the seat has so many movement and tilt options with just a simple press of a button. Vision is good and I have found less blind spots than with other vehicles. Also with 5 shoulder seat belts and air bags we have always felt very safe in our MPV.

Anyone who likes a larger vehicle and hauls items, family, friends, who works out of their vehicle or enjoys traveling and just getting away on the weekends will enjoy the Mazda MPV. The MPV has been the best purchase we ever made and at over 100,000 miles it is sure to be in our family for a long long time. <br><br>
