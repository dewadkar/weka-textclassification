If you are looking at some of the 2000 compact sedans, you will definitely run across both the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corrolla.  Both of these cars seem to always come up in a conversation if you want something that was built to last.  I did some heavy research online and at the car lot.  Since I was driving a 93 Ford Probe that have over 200,000+ miles on it and the hood had flown off the car twice, I figured it was a good time to retire the probe.  (Don�t you think)

Anyway I want to list out some information in this epinion to help alleviate some of the headaches for you.  First I want to tell you who I am and what I was looking for including options, pricing, and so on to see if you fit in the same category as me.

<b><i>Who are we and what are we looking for?</b></i>
My name is Bill and I am happily married for about 3 years now.  We have a little boy named Joey who just made 1.5 years old (Since he is over a year and a half, I figured I can stop with the month thing, ie 18Months).  So that means we need a car that is <b>reliable</b> with atleast <b>four doors</b> and <b>AC</b>.  Since I have a lead foot and tend to speed a lot that means I need <b>cruise control</b> as well.  Set the speed and not worry about the foot.  So that is a 4 door sedan with AC and Cruise.  So that is where my search began.  Oh, one more thing�  Since I am kind of a cheap guy, the car had to be <b>inexpensive</b>.

<b><i>Where to begin?</b></i>
I asked around to find out what most people liked and what was reliable.  It was pretty straightforward.  Most of my friends liked Toyotas and Hondas.  So I started looking at different ones to see what we should get.  After looking at what was on the market, I figured I could live with a <b>4 cylinder</b> and not go for the V6.  So that put me in the search for a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corrolla.  I figured I could live with a base model with cruise, so I started surfing the web to see what I could find.  Since 2001s are out now, 2000s are not as easy to find anymore.  Not even on the web, but they are still out there.  Another thing I found was that I couldn�t find a base with cruise.  So I had to step up from the base to the mid model.  (Honda�s = LX, and Toyota = CE)  Now I knew what to test drive a 2000 Honda Civic LXs and Toyota Corrolla CEs.  I also went to www.edmunds.com and to autos.yahoo.com to find out what kind of price I should pay and do some comparisons.  I won�t go into too many specifics and all of the headaches.  If you do want a tip on that, see my epinion entitled �Car Buying w/o The Haggle � Maybe What You Want!�

<b><i>Here is what I found � What you have all been waiting for</b></i>
The base 2000 Honda Civic LX compared to the 2000 Corrollo CE.  I will just list the statistics that helped me make my decision.  I will let you look at the numbers than tell you what I bought.

(Honda/Toyota)
Base Price		$14,930/$13,108
Dealer Price		$13,223/$11,610
Standard Engine	1.6L I4/1.8L I4
Horsepower		106@6200/125@5600
Fuel Economy (C/H)	(32/37)/(31/38)
Fuel Capacity		11.9/13.2
Shldr Room (Ft/Rr)	(52.4/51.8)/(52.8/52.2)

These were just a few of the statistics that helped me make my choice.  All of the numbers listed here I got from auto.yahoo.com car comparison on 8/10/00.  So if you just do the numbers, it would appear that the 2000 Toyota Corrolla CE is a better deal than the 2000 Honda Civic LX.  So we got the 2000 Toyota Corrolla CE.  My wife and I also noticed (before we looked at the numbers) that the Corrolla seemed a little roomier in the front than the Honda did.  Went back and checked the numbers and you can see it doesn�t seem like much, but we were able to tell.

So there you have it.  We got the roomier car, with a bigger engine, bigger tank, and good gas mileage.  The 2000 Toyota Corrolla CE.  We did buy this car used (a program car) with 12,500 miles on it.
