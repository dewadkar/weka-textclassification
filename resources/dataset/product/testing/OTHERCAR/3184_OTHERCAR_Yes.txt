                Since making its debut in 1966 the Alfa Romeo Spider has existed in this country up until 1995 when Alfa decided(regretably) that U.S. sales weren't worth the effort. In its nearly 30 year run it went through very few changes.

    One reason it changed so little is when it debuted it was quite advanced compared to most of its competition back in the mid-sixties. Few automobiles came equipped with the long list of standard features the Alfa Spider did. Double overhead camshafts, 5 speed all syncromesh transmission, fuel injection were just a few of the technological advances the Alfa had over its mostly British competition.

    Unfortunately for Alfa they did not evolve too much with the times. Unlike Porsche with its 911 which  made its debut about the same time as the Alfa. The original 911 with its flat 6 motor displacing about 2 liters putting out about 130 hp. Very close to Alfa's inline 4.

    Porsche's engine however evolved into a 3.6 liter 286 hp powerplant by 1995 where as Alfa's motor still was only producing about 130 hp. But not evolving like the 911 isn't really as bad as it sounds. Alfa did make many other changes to its roadster. Electronic ignition, electronic fuel injection, rustproofed body panels(1986) were a few of the upgrades the little spider experienced over the years.

    In the nineties the Alfa usually found itself being compared to Mazda's Miata. These two roadsters were closely matched in size, horsepower, and curb weight but that's where the similarities ended.

    I have the perspective of having owned both cars. A 1986 
Alfa Spider back in 1990. And a 1997 Mazda Miata which I bought new. The  Alfa's #1 attribute without a doubt was its Pininfarina styling, the Miata's styling was basically Japans interpretation of Lotus's Elan roadster of the sixties.

    The Alfa's styling drew more comments from onlookers than any other sportscar I have owned. Performance however lagged behind my Miata not by a lot mind you but what can you expect out of a thirty year old chassis design. 

     I owned my Alfa for about 2 years and my only unscheduled trip to the shop was to replace a broken motor mount. Would I buy another? Sure, so long as cutting edge performance wasn't a priority. The Alfa was like having a retro British roadster without all those headaches from Lucas electrics.<br><br>
