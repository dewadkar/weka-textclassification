            The GM Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is the ultimate in truck-cruising comfort, and is more comfortable than 99% of the cars on the road today.  <br>I live in the mountains and was looking for a vehicle which would not only provide a comfortable ride up and down mountainous roads in good weather, but would provide a safe ride up and down my mountain in wintry weather as well.  I was looking for a safe and secure truck, and the Chevrolet Silverado met my needs and my expectations.  <br><br>This vehicle rides like the ultimate luxury car----you feel no bumps in the road,  it hugs the road and provides tight control for the driver, it takes the corners really smoothly, it enables you to sit comfortably, and provides room for 3 adults in the front seat and three in the extended cab seat (he seats are big enough for an adult to sleep comfortably) .  The GM Chevrolet Silverado has all its buttons in the right place, easily accessible to both driver and passengers----radio, heater/a-c, equalizer, and more.  <br><br>This is the truck to buy if you want luxury, class, roominess, and a smooth ride.   <br><br>The only negative about his truck is, because it is a big truck, gas mileage is not as good as you might want it to be.  But what you get (comfort and style), for what you give up (the somewhat low mpg), makes it well-worth  what it costs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
