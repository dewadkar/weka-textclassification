            So after receiving and unexpected bonus from my employer I went hiking off to Circuit City here in Harrisburg, Pa for a new toy. If you have ever seen the Circuit City commercial where the guy and his wife go into store, and the guy gets this look on his face of pure childlike ecstasy then goes bolting of into the store? That's me. In fact my girlfriend hates having me in one....but anyway. On to the review. 

As usual, geeky stuff first. 

Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P30 1.3 Mega Pixel Digital Still Camera. 

Memory: Sony Memory Stick (4mb stick incl. avail in many sizes as an example a 16mb stick would cost me $25) 

Zoom: 3x Optical/6x Digital 

Power: 2 AA batteries(included but see below), NP-FS11 Info Lithium Battery(not included), AC-LS1 AC Adaptor & charger (optional) 

Flash: Regular and Auto Focus Illuminator (for night/dark shots) 

Extras: In Camera Picture Effects (4): Sepia, B&W, Negative Art and Solarization, white balance 1.5 123k pixel LCD screen (color of course.) 

I'm not one to reinvent the wheel so if you are looking for more detailed specs go here.

Usage: 

Once I stopped doing cartwheels down the stereo section I decided to stroll over to the cameras. The CSR there walked me thru a few models, including the DSC-P30 & P50. Those are essentially the same camera, except the p50 has 3.1 mega pixels as opposed to the p30's 1.3. 

The cam itself is light and fairly compact, but you aren't going to get it into the pocket of your Levi's so forget that. It does however fit happily into a coat pocket. 

The LCD screen is a *little* bit on the small side at 1.5 inches, but when you use that sucker you won't be disappointed. Amazingly bright in daytime and darkness, with rich color and good detail considering the size. 

Navigation of the camera's controls are simple and done thru a turn of a knob or press of a button. 

Now here is where the complaints start, but there are only a couple. 

The provided memory stick is okay but will only hold 7-8 pictures @ 1280x960. It will hold 50 or so @ 640x480. In other words, shell out the $25 for at least a 16mb stick. 

Okay, so the camera runs on alkaline batteries or optional battery pack. *insert generous amounts of laughter* maximum time I was able to squeeze out of alkaline batteries was about 30-40 mins of use with moderate to heavy use of the LCD. I used Duracell Ultra's in case you are wondering. You can extend alkaline battery life by turning off the LCD and flash but I'm not going to do that lol. In other words pop for the Sony Stamina recharge able battery which boasts about an hour and a half of picture time. 

At a price of $264.99 (with tax) this is an excellent camera, and sure beats the pants off anything else in my general price range. No this isn't the **best** camera in the price range but it packs in huge features into a small cam. Go get it.
