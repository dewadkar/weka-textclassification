            After reading some of the Epinions about the Honda CRX, I had to stick my two cents in.  I am a devoted HF owner ( I don't mind looking like &quot;an ass&quot; with HF on my bumper). I bought my 1991 CRX HF new at the end of 1991 because I needed an economical car for medical school.  It has more than lived up to its expectations.  If I had known Honda was going to stop making them I would have bought 2.

I have put about 120K on the car thus far. Essentially ALL of it New York City driving.  I have had my share of repairs, but almost every single one of them has been my fault - riding the clutch, not getting the clutch replaced when I couldn't use 1st gear for 1 month, riding the brakes, etc.  The only repairs that have not been my fault are the frequent muffler changes (actually, those are probably my fault, also).  The muffler is very low to the ground, rusts out quite quickly and needs to be replaced quite frequently, every 2 years or so.  This is probably partially, but not completely due to how I drive the car (potholes? hmm, how many can I hit on 38th street?).  I have also not done one manufacturer recommended routine maintenance, except 3k oil changes.  The last time I brought it in to the dealer, they said I really should change the timing belt - I only brought it to the dealer because they had a coupon for $39 front brake special (which it didn't need - go figure). Maybe I should get that done - what do you think? 

Suffice it to say, I ABUSE the car and it has NEVER stranded me.  Okay, I ran out of gas once - I wanted to see if I could really get 400mi on one tank. But it stalled about 100ft from a gas station and I simply pushed the car to the gas station myself (Yes ladies! you can push the car all by yourself from the driver side door and steer at the same time, the car is that light - yes, I am a woman).  Every morning, I simply go outside and pray that the car will still be there and it starts right up.  I have never had to turn the key twice.

Parking in Manhattan is a nightmare, except for me and the other CRX owners. I can park ANYWHERE it is legal.  I will often wait and watch the silly SUVs try to get in a space then simply scout right in when the driver realizes that Land Rover (or Ford Escort) is just too big for the space.  The car handles extremely well, I can do U-Turns on city streets without doing a 3-point turn, can maneuver into parking spots very easily and dash around in traffic.

The car also has excellent pick-up.  I am not a car expert, but anyone I have let drive it, loves it and always comments on how great the acceleration is - even with my little engine.  I can easily accelerate to highway speeds and if I'm behind someone on the on-ramp, I find myself shouting out the window &quot;It's the long thin pedal on the right!&quot;.

So what are the drawbacks of the car - hmm, for me none.  The ideal person for the car is someone who is miserly, doesn't care about looks although, I have seen many CRXs which owners have maintained beautifully, and someone who doesn't have to haul a lot of PEOPLE around.

The car is only a two seater,and I mean 2 seater. You can put people in the hatch, which I have done on more than one occasion, but it is neither comfortable nor safe, and I don't think the rear passengers would survive a rear end collision at speeds greater than 25 mph. BUT the car has more &quot;cargo&quot; space than most larger sedans I've seen.  I have moved chest of drawers, futons, etc. in the hatch and been able to close it! The dog has plenty of room in the back, and we have even thrown 2 dogs back there.  They can lie down comfortably together if they are medium sized.  Ours is a lab mix, the other was a lab/chow mix to give you the idea of size.

For parents who are considering buying this car for a teenager, know your child well. If your little one is not a good driver or you think s/he would be prone to speeding (the car is VERY zippy), I would think twice about this car.  Although I have had my share of accidents with the car - 4 to be exact - they have all been NYC-type fender benders at low or no speed.  I would be concerned for someone's safety at higher speeds because the car is essentially a tin can on wheels. Remember I can and have pushed the car by myself and one time some pranksters (4 drunk men) actually picked the car up and moved it to another parking space! For college students, it is a great car- fuel efficient - I still get 35-40 mpg in NYC driving, 50mpg or greater on the highway.  And you can haul around lots of junk in the back.  For commuters, especially city commuters, it is a must- fuel efficient, zippy, easy parking, etc. Moms with kids - NO WAY - never put little ones in the back! It is NOT safe, and I would be concerned about a car seat in the front passenger.  

I have taken the car on long trips - NYC to North Carolina once or twice a year - it is a 10 hour drive.  It is fine on the back, even the dog was comfortable in the hatch with herself, her dog toys, the cooler and all the luggage and Christmas presents. The only drawback on the long trip is the road noise which is loud, especially at higher speeds.

All and all it was great purchase and I would recommend it highly.  I will actually be looking for new car soon(the interior and exterior are so beat up, it is getting to be embarrassing), but I cannot find one out there that compares to my &quot;puppy&quot;.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate them.

One more thing - were there people actually foolish enough to buy an automatic? Stick to the 5 speed.  If you don't know how to drive one, the car and clutch are very forgiving - I have taught 2 people how to drive a stick on this car.
