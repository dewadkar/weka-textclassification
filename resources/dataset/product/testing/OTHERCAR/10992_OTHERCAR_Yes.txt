            The Chevy Astro Van~

Our family bought a Chevy Astro Conversion Van in the winter of 1995. We fell in love with it the minute we saw it, forest green interior, TV, VCR, etc. 

Maybe those things aer what drew us to it - but what got us, was that is was a Chevy. Since Chevrolet is known for quality, my husband was no problem to convince. He is a Chevy guy, so to speak.

Let me say this - at this moment - we are in the middle of a blizzard - and where is my husband? Out at the store, in out Chevy Astro Van. That is how much we trust it. And with a family of 6, trust is the biggest issue when purchasing a vehicle in my opinion. Without quality and reliability, what do you have? And would you trust your children in it? I DO in this van, in any weather, under any circumstances.

We have never had any mechanical trouble with it- in fact, all we have had to do with it is standard maintenance, clean up, etc...

Other than that - it takes care of itself, truthfully.

I think this is a good vehicle for families, roomy interior, TOTALLY reliable, great price range, and to be honest, as far as vans go - this one is really good on gas as well.

If you are in the market for a mini-van, please take the time to take a look at this one - you won't be disappointed if quality and  dependability are your main interests.
