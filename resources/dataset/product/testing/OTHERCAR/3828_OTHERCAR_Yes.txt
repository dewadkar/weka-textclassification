            We have been looking to downsize from our minivan for two years.  We never found the right vehicle, either too expensive, not right options, etc.  We really wanted to have a vehicle we could tow behind our motorhome, but I wanted an automatic.  We really thought we were not going to find the perfect vehicle.  We came close to buying a RAV4, but they don't come with ABS brakes unless you buy the real pricey model (we had given up on a tow vehicle by then.)  Then our daughter bought a '97 CRV and was very pleased with it. (By the way, her car has 170,000 miles and runs great!)  We found out the 2002 was being changed and waited to test drive one.  We test drove a '01 and then the '02 and couldn't believe the difference.  Roomier, smoother ride, quieter, and much more horsepower.  Then the salesman told us we could tow this, even the automatic, showed us right in the manual!  My husband rides dirt bikes, and we can tow his motorcycle trailer behind the CRV if we want.  That to us was the greatest selling point.  We had to wait about 2 weeks for ours, but it was well worth the wait. It is not a fancy luxury style car, but that's not what we were looking for.  It is much more than just functional, however. The car is comfortable inside, with plenty of amenities.  Ours is midnight black, which looks like a deep blue when the sun hits it right.  I love the black, it is the color I chose, but wish it came with a choice of the beige interior.  All in all, we are VERY pleased. I call it my 'Zippy' little car.
