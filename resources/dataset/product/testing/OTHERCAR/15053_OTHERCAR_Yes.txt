            The main selling points of this camera are the floppy storage and ease of use. It is incredibly easy to use. My wife who never wants to have to bother with manuals and messy hookups loves it and was a master in a matter of minutes. Being able to just pop floppies in and out is a great feature and makes life a lot easier loading onto your PC. The rechargeable battery life is pretty good also. The one downside for this particular model is the picture quality. Some pics have come out phenomenal, but this is not the norm. Most are grainy and don't come out well when printed. I have small children and I bought this mainly to take family pics be able to print out pics on my own. I am hoping to sell it to a friend and buy a higher end Sony model. Good starter camera. I highly recommend the Sony line of digital cameras.<br><br>
