            We bought this vehicle as an upgrade to a Subaru wagon.  This is the one minivan out of all of them that we drove that actually moved when we stepped on the gas.  Most other minivans bog down.  The traction control is very nice in the snow when we go snowboarding.  The seating configurations are very good, but a little heavy to move in or out.  The stereo cd player is very good too.  But here's the downside: little things are breaking down or falling apart altogether.  The power window switch on the driver side has broken, $100.  The rear window wiper has stopped working, $140.  The power sliding door needs to be aligned every so often so that it will shut, $65 x 4.   The rear hatch door handle broke off, $45.  These $ amounts are costs for parts only.  The lenses around the headlights fill up with water, burning out the head lamps, $?  We had them fixed when the car was under warranty, now it has happened again and the dealer says they don't know if they will fix it.  Come on guys, this is a recurring problem!  Sure we like the car, but it's nickel and dime-ing us to death!  This vehicle is only 2 years old and it's falling apart.  We have but one child and she's an angel.  None of the problems with this van are due to abuse or neglect.
And the customer service people seem to be trying to get out of their responsibility.  If you do buy this vehicle, buy the extended warranty, because you'll definitely need it!!!<br><br>
