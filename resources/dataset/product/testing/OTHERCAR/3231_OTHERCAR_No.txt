            Another $70 down the drain.  This is what I get for purchasing a camera on a whim.  This is the dangers of walking into your local Wal-Mart without checking out Epinions.com first.  From the top, the three worse functions of this camera are: clarity, ease of use, and cash value.

Trust me, Polaroid knows how to package a product.  The camera looks like any other ordinary camera.  It has a lens, a flash, a few buttons at the top, and even a smooth area to properly place your thumb.  It looks far better than your normal disposal camera, but it takes far worse pictures.

<b>Clarity</b>
If you don't mind your pictures coming out, where one central point is in focus, and the rest of the frame is blurry, then you've got a great camera.  Imagine, snapping a picture of your love one.  Her/His face is in focus, but the rest of her/him including the background is blurry.  Definitely not a picture worth framing.  That's about the context of this camera.  Never before have I had a problem with even a cheap disposal camera in relation to this situation.  I don't know what the cause is, but this camera takes horrible pictures.  And don't even get me started on what happens at night.  

Too late, I'm on a roll.  At night, the camera spits out pictures so grainy you could swear they were taken 50 years ago and have degraded over time.  Little pieces of red, blue, green, intermixed with black and white spots appear all over the frame.  

One final note on clarity, light also seems to drive this camera mad.  This in turn, makes this camera horrible under all circumstances.  Light, darkness, and everything in-between.  I took a couple of pictures just yesterday, and my subjects came out dark while a light source came out blaring like the sun.  Even pictures taken where light sources are behind the camera, still bleed into frame.  I've snapped a total of 60 pictures so far, and I have yet to get one good picture.  

<b>Ease of Use</b>
It's been about a week since I purchased this product.  So far I have gone through 8 AAA batteries.  The camera can operate longer even after the batteries have worn down, but the flash is unusable.  At 4 to 5 dollars a pop, buying batteries for this camera adds up quickly.  

Unlike I previously thought, this camera doesn't connect via true USB.  The plug that goes into your computer is USB, but the plug that goes into the camera is serial.  Alone, this isn't a problem.  But if you have multiple USB devices, and plan to swap between them, you will have to dedicate one USB port to this camera.  No other devices except for the camera will fit into the serial connection, thus forcing you to either plug/unplug the device, or dedicate one USB port just for the camera.

<b>Software</b>
More design went into the software than the camera, unfortunately.  Although it is a tad confusing to download and delete pictures off the camera, the included software has tons of features for tweaking your pictures.  You can make the picture brighter, darker, sharper, and blurry.  You can put the faces of your subjects into pre-designed backgrounds.  Basically, the software allows for minor to major editing of your pictures.  Again, however, it's too bad that the pictures that come out of the camera are so bad they are almost beyond repair.

<b>Worth The Money?</b>
Simple answer.  No.  This camera wouldn't even satisfy as a "My First Digital Camera".  It needs lots of help to even be put in the same category as that of a regular camera.  Disposable cameras take far better pictures and cost less in the long run.  I've already decided, that I'll be putting my camera up for sale on eBay in hopes of getting some of my money back.  

Trust me, save your money.  If you�re looking for a cheap digital camera for your kids to throw around, drop on the floor, and abuse, then go ahead and buy this product.  You can always blame the poor quality on their abusive nature.  But, if you�re looking for an inexpensive camera to enter into the digital world, then don�t go this cheap.  You won�t be satisfied.  You will be disappointed.  Continue to save your extra pennies and buy a better camera.  Perhaps one day, cheap digital camera will exist.  For now, they are a lost cause.
