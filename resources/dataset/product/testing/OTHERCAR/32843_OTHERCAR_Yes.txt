            I have a four dour 1995 Cavalier, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. It has an amazing amount of get up and go for a four banger engine. 
You know what else? It was cheap. Those of us who lack trust fund and who have a built in utilitarianism like that fact.
This car is dependable. Sixty thousand miles and not so much as a hiccup. 
If you need a car to get from here to there, that doesn't look bad, gets good gas mileage, and has really comfy seat then the Cavalier from Chevrolet is your car.<br><br>
