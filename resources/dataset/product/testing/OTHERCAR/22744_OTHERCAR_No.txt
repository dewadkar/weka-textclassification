            In 1994 my first husband and I were looking to trade in our car for a newer, sportier model. When we were shown a used 1993 Pontiac GrandAm, White paint, black interior, slightly tinted windows, I WAS IN LOVE! This car was "it" in my opinion. I stand 5'10 and I had leg room regardless if I was the driver or a passenger in back. The back seat held 2 adults and one child comfortably. The steering was so smooth and the ride was comfortable. I felt GOOD driving this car. 

We bought it after the first test drive and couldn't wait to show it off to our parents. Well guess what, we got stranded at my in laws because the car wouldn't start!!!! When you turned the key, there'd be a click then SILENCE! *argh* After about an hour, it just magically started. I was angry then thankful. We gave this car another chance.

The next time we were stranded we'd gone out to eat and were returning home. Guess what! My ex turned the key and we heard a click, then silence. I was irate! About 40 mins later, it worked. We both decided it needed to go to the mechanics. They changed the battery in it and all seemed well for a few months.

Then within a 6 week span, I was late for work about 4 times because when I'd gotten into my car to leave there'd be a CLICK then silence. We took the car BACK to the mechanics two more times, 2 new alternators and the advice that "this was typical of a four quad engine in Pontiac Grand Ams" my ex husband and I decided we just couldn't keep this unreliable car. I was heartbroken because I KNEW how much I liked this car...when it worked. The belts seemed to squeak a lot too.

Well, we traded it in for a brand new Mitsubishi Gallant which mended my broken heart in a hurry but THAT'S entirely another epinion *smile*
