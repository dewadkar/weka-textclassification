            I bought this van in October of 2001 to replace our old 1991 Dodge Caravan 4 cylinder.  It is my wife's vehicle, but also I like it.  Although it has a lot more options than my 1991 Caravan, it is still kind of basic. We have the 3.3 flexible fuel V6, Cruise Control, Power Windows & mirrors & locks, a tachometer, tape player, tinted windows, and dual sliding doors. We have taken it on many 8 hour trips and we are all still comfortable in the seats. A month ago my seventeen year old son was driving it home from school because my 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass was broke again (look at "Another reason to buy a Dodge.") and ran into a golf ball sized hail storm. He was not hurt but the van was hail damaged and the air bag sensor spring was also damaged. We had around $3,000 worth of damage, which the insurance company paid and the air bag sensor spring was covered under the base warranty. It has 13,032 miles on it and still runs like new.
I know many people with Ford vans and GM vans who have had all different types of problems with their Ford or GM van falling apart, and will not buy another van from those companies;however, I know many people with a Dodge Caravan who used to say that they would never buy a Chrysler product until they bought this a Caravan and now have fallen in love with Chrysler because of these wonderful vans they make. Many people only think their junk and nothing special until they have a ride in one.  My wife's sister is an example.  She is leasing a 1999 Mercedes 500 convertible, and even she was impressed and likes it.  This is Chrysler product number seven and all of them have held up well so far(knock on wood).  

UPDATE-4/21/03

Well, My 2002 Dodge Caravan has just turned to 30,000 miles and no major problems yet!  After doing research I have found out that the 3.3L OHV V6 motors are known for lasting at least 200,000 miles when maintained properly.  I believe this is possible.  I have even found that the 41TE/A604 4-speed automatic transmission is capable of lasting 200,000 miles also as long as you have the transmission fluid flushed and filter changed every 15,000-30,000 miles with Chrysler ATF+4 transmission fluid.  I still am very happy with it and plan on putting at least 200,000 miles on it.  The only minor problem I have had was the right sliding door has a problem with hitting the door frame.  The dealer says this is a problem.  Oh well, that's just a minor problem.  

For anyone who is thinking about buying a Ford Windstar, a Chevrolet Venture (Oldsmobile and Pontiac equivalents), or a Japanese minivan.  Please consider a Dodge Caravan. They are worth every penny of which you spend.

UPDATE-1/2/03

Well the van just past the 42,000 mile mark and it still been pretty much trouble free!  The only problem I have right now is a broken windshield which is of course not the van's fault.  In fact, I am rather impressed with it.  My son was driving 60 MPH on the highway and a grain truck was coming the other direction and a rock around the size of a small apple flew out of the back of the truck and hit the windshield.  The combined speed of the force was probably over 100 MPH.  It only cracked the outer layer and not the inner layer.  I would have thought than it would have broken through the window.  Anyways, I still strongly  recommend the van.
