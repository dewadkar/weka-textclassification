              My family has had many cars over the years. Out of all of them, its the Camry that stands out as one of the best. Its not the most exciting car out there, but its an honest care that does its intended job quite well.

Engine/transmission: A
   Ours is the LE model with the 2.2 liter Twin Cam four cylinder. Its a very smooth and quiet engine but with only 130 horsepower, its no rocket. I have not had a chance to drive the V6 model but I'm sure its way better in this respect. The transmission is really smooth at all times. Its amazing that the engine and transmission feel like they have about 20,000 miles on them but in fact they have over 100,000 miles more than that!

Steering/handling: B
  The Camry has a very solid body structure. This rigid platform allows for and incredible ride. The handling if safe and predictable but not all that responsive. The steering is a little bit slower than the Honda Accord's and does not provide as much feel. The brakes work very well but again, not much feel. 

Interior: A+
  The '92-'96 Camrys have a superb interior design. The dash is good looking and functional with large knobs and gauges that help to make a less stressful driving experience. The seats are among the best and are large. Even the rear seat is comforatble and is more reclined than many, making it more relaxing. The cup holders are a good design that hold cups! The armrest is high enough for most people. One note is that the air conditioning has failed on a few occasions. I hear this was common on the '92 model. Its been good for a few years now that we had it switched over to the new system.

Exterior: A
  I still like the way these older Camrys look. It was a great design to begin with and withstood the test of time. It still looks like a small Lexus LS400 in profile. I actually prefer the lines on the old Camry to the ones on the '97 to present models.It is easy to forget where you park since Toyota probably sold close to 3 million of this style Camry!

Overall: A
  The Camry is a car that does almost everything well. Its a very comfortable and relaxing car to drive and boosts Toyota's high level of quality and reliability. Its not the most fun car in this class, but it is the most refined. Its a class act in the family sedan segment and should be on your shopping list if looking for a used car.
