                What cute, sporty, inexpensive little car.  How could you not love the sleek yet boxy bumper of this car.  I test drove a 2000 Honda Accord Coupe only a few months ago.  I fell in love!  My personal favorite the Candy Apple Red with tan leather interior, is out of this world.  The car is easy to drive and rides great!  Roomy for 2 people and 2 people only!  I would have loved to have owned this little cutie, which brings me to one of its only bad points.  Honda dealer are sticklers about prices and trade ins.  Would you believe that they wouldn't give me pay-off on my car.  These little cars catch my eye everytime I pass one on the road.  If my opinion you couldn't beat it with a corvette.  Ok Ok so that's pushing it!  I highly recommend looking in to buying one, if you can get those little stinkers to work with you on price and trade in.<br><br>
