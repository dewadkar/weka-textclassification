             	I'm writing about the 1994 Galant's.  I love the easy handling of the Galant, the body style and the price.  I hate the fact that I have spent thousands of dollars on repairs the whole three years that I've owned this car. I have had to replace the transmission, tie rods, motor mounts, the water pump, stabilizer bushings and several other major things.  I started to buy a Toyota Camry, but was told that the Galant was comparable to the Camry just cheaper YEAH RIGHT!  My sister bought a Camry the same year as my Galant and has only had it in for regular maintenance repairs.
	It's pretty sad when your mechanic starts to feel sorry for you to the point where he's doing repairs with free labor.  Oh by the way did I mention that my ball joint fell apart as I was driving down the street.  My neighbors said the noise was so loud they thought I'd had an accident and came running out of the house to help.
	In my opinion the Galant is an over rated vehicle that was built for looks and not longevity.  The 2000 Galant looks good (I really love the new design) and has a nice price tag, I just hope it isn't the LEMON the 1994 Galant's are. 
	I wouldn't recommend a used Galant to my worst enemy (at least not the 94's) but the 2000 may be better built. Then again maybe I would recommend a used one to my worst enemy  : ]      <br><br>
