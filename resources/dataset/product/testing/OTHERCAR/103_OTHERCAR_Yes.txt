            I bought a 2003 XL7 Limited. In Canada the Limited comes only one way, one colour(Cool beige) and fully loaded. I am not an expert in cars or SUV's but appreciate different makes and models of all types. 

I also own a BMW M5 and Sidekick 4 door. I must say that I LOVE this 4WD SUV. Lets get one thing straight though, this is a real 4WD truck and not some wimpy car based SUV. It has a full ladder frame, 2 speed transfer case so it meant for some hardcore offroading, Yes you can rock crawl in the XL7 if you pick the right lines but ground clearance is not that great so I would take it easy. 

I have read some past  reviews where people complain that this SUV has an old style 4WD shifter and that you have to slow down to shift into 4WD low, these dumb comments indicate to me that those reviewers have no idea what 4WD low is meant for and they are probably better suited for one of those AWD car based SUV's or a minivan.

Take a look at the most capable 4WD vehicles on the planet from Toyota, Nissan, Land Rover and Jeep just to name a few and you will find that they all a few things in common, full truck ladder frame and 2 spd transfer case which is exactly what Suzuki 4WD vehicles have and the car based SUVs dont have.  

So if you think a CRV, RAV4 or Escape are the same as this SUV then do some research and will find they are completely different in purpose and capability or lack thereof. They are cars posing as SUV's for the crowd who probably cannot bear to drive minivans. I prefer driving the real thing and not a 4WD pretender which is why I chose the XL7. Suzuki is creator of the small 4wd SUV with years and years of offroading experience. 

Suzuki has in the past had some quality control issues but no more. My 2003 Limited is built as well as anything I have personally seen. My mind was actually set on purchasing a BMW X5 since I also a dedicated BMW nut but it lacks room and has no offroading capacities. For $25000 LESS I have leather, sunroof, rear seat DVD, 6 disc CD changer by Clarion, 6 Speakers and Subwoofer, seating for 7 and every other option you can think of. 

The ride is buttery smooth and although the V6 only pushes out 183 HP, this quad cam (YES QUAD CAM) V6 rings everything it can and is great around town and on the highway. I pulled my GTECH PRO out of my BMW M5 and tried it my XL7 and I got a pretty impressive 0-60mph time of 8.7 seconds. Thats not so bad. Handling is excellent with no bad traits although I would prefer some taller tires for some additional ground clearance. 

I love the fact that the V6 has a timing chain and not a silly timing belt. The only real fault I can find in my 2003 XL7 Limited is the buttons on the keyless entry remote are too sensitive. 

To those people who think the 3rd row seating is unuseable then think again, while not the roomiest they are not meant to be, I often take 6 adults in my XL7 and if you adjust the second row seating correctly and learn how to use the 3rd row release mechanism then its a breeze, while none of my friends are much over 6 ft tall they are fine back there and I must say I use the 3rd row seats allot more than I expected. The kids love it and treat it like their own private area. 

The redesigned dashboard and ergonomics are nothing short of amazing, A nice little touch is the external temperature display which shows attention to detail by displaying a little snow flake when the temperatures outside reaches freezing, maybe not a big deal but the attention to detail is impressive. There are no less than 5 child tether seat attachments. The seats have good support although on a recent 10 hour long road trip I needed to stretch my legs every few hours which is something I never need to do in my BMW M5. The rear air conditioning is a blessing too, even in 90 degree heat everyone in the XL7 stays cool and comfortable. BTW on this roadtrip we averaged 22 mpg loaded with luggage, 5 adults, 1 child, cruising 75 mph on the I5 with A/C on all the way, thats impressive. The engine is not a powerhouse but it has good power for jumping out the gate around town and on the highway has more than enough power for passing and maintaining 75-85 mph speeds fully laden with people and luggage. Windnoise is minimal although the optional Montblanc roof rack is noisy at highways speeds.

I understand Suzuki has jumped 31% in quality in 2003 over previous years and it really shows, this SUV is rock solid, not one rattle or squeek after 10,000 miles and no problems. The only cost has been an oil and diff oil change which cost me $47 CDN and Suzuki gave me a loaner car for the day. Also included when you buy this SUV is free 5 year unlimited mileage roadside assistance and the warranty is  100,000 kms or 5 years on the drivetrain. I wish Suzuki would offer as options a  comprehensive skid plate package, a bigger tire and a factory installed rear seat DVD system. 

Seriously there is nothing in this price range that can match the XL7 Limited in features and quality and off road capability. I understand 95% of people who buy SUV's never take them offroad which is the reason why those poseur car based AWD SUVs are so popular which is fine if thats what you want but for those who want the real thing which does everything well then look no further, you wont regret it and will quickly fall in love with this SUV.
