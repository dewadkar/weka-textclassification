            Let me tell you, This 87' Tercel is definitely one of the best car Toyota ever made! I bought this car from a friend of mine for only $500, 4 years ago. It looked bad, to be honest, had many bumps and dents, ruggedy sounds which eventually busted and gone, I just needed a car to go to school. My friend who sold the car to me, treated the car as a ruggedy car...she did not even care when she hit the tree or anything. The car started shaking when it went over 65-70mph.
All my friends would know that it is my tercel when they see it because of the looks it had. Well, they all thouht that I must be having a lot of problem with this old car...

This is the best example of &quot;You can never judge the book by its cover&quot;. This car never die! I had the car for 3 years, and I NEVER had to see the mechanic at all!!!
(except that I did change the CV-Axels when I bought it.)

Once I had a big accidents that involved 5 cars...my tercel got more bumps than ever, looks just as bad as before. Well, since it was not my fault, I did not have to pay at all, and the guy who hit the first car paid us all... the tercel gave me $1,300.00 (more than what I paid for car) sacrificing his own body.
I did not fix the body, and used it for my tuition. He never changed his attitude, and he still ran good after the accident.
2 year ago, the stereo totally gone broke, too, I was carrying boombox in the car and that worked for me.

Now it is in the possession of my friend, but the car is still going strong...I still see the old car runnning freely on the road. It was the biggest mistake I ever made to sell the car. 
(I bought me a nice looking sport car instead...then it just started giving me a whole lot of problems!...only after I sold this dependable tercel.)

I still talk to the previous &amp; current owners of this car...all of us amazed how strong this car is despite its bad looks!  He never gives any of us too much problems. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CAR THAT TOYOTA EVER MADE...
What a car!  I am having a so much trouble with later model cars now, and he is still going strong, laughing at me sold the car away...

THis is perfect car for a student,who just need a ride to get around.
Highly Recommended from all my heart!
The best car I ever had! 
If my friend sells the car someday, I will buy it back no matter how it looks, as long as it runs.<br><br>
