            Now what happened was the following: I needed a car, really bad. So what did I do? I went to an auto auction and just got something. What a surprise, it was a Korean �Rice sedan�. I can tell you up front, it was better than I expected.

The exterior is nothing special, I mean, there are worse cars out there. Somehow I actually started liking that cars look.

As the exterior is the interior, I really just do not like brown interiors, and that is what they put into my dark green Elantra. It is all in reach of the driver, even the manual passenger-window-handle.

The 1.6 liter engine does not give you �too� much power, in fact it is sometime actually slow, but lets face it, who needs to be first at the next red light? With four persons inside, the Elantra still gets moving and makes enough speed to get tickets. And now here it comes, this car get an excellent gas mileage between 23 and 30 mpg, isn�t that something. The engine sure sounds like 1.6 liters, but that doesn�t hurt, it rides smoothly even at higher speeds.
 The handling: again, nothing special, like a sedan, which it is. Not really sporty and not really wobbly like SUV�s.

Now here comes my big surprise, the reliability and especially the repairs. I don�t mind to repair little stuff by myself. Little stuff is usually defined by the cars construction, is it totally packed under the hood or not. This car is packed, but still I could reach all necessary parts more or less easily. If there are major repairs necessary, it might be more expensive to bring the Elantra into the shop, but minor stuff is easy to make, again surprisingly. Parts for the Elantra are kind of hard to get sometimes, you might have to wait one or two weeks, if the guy at the shop orders the parts for a Hyundai and not a Honda, be sure he understands which car you got there.
