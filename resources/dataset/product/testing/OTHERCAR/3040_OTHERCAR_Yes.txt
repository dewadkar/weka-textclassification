            New supercharged model makes this sweet sports car more desirable. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The big news for Jaguar's 2000 XK sports car line is the awesome, supercharged, 370-horsepower XKR version of the venerable British automaker's regular XK8 sports car. 

While the XK8 is fast with its 4.0-liter 290-horsepower V8, the XKR gives Jaguar a model to compete with really fast sports cars such as Porsche and Ferrari. And the supercharged, intercooled version of the XK8 dual-overhead-camshaft 32-valve engine is as smooth and docile as the regular engine. 

New XK8 items include Platinum and Titanium paint colors. There's also new 18-inch alloy wheels (not the same as those standard on the XKR) and a new, optional high-powered Alpine premium sound system with digital sound processing. The standard audio system adds two speakers. Anti-lock brake electronics have been revised, and front brake rotors are larger. 

Hot Rod XKR
The XKR sprints to 60 mph in 5.0 seconds and tops out at 155 mph. The XK8 hits 60 in 6.7 seconds and has the same top speed. But, overall, the XKR feels stronger at all speeds. 

The XKR doesn't cost a fortune more than the XK8. The XKR coupe lists at $76,800 and the convertible costs $81,800. The XK8 coupe has a $66,200 base price, while the soft-top goes for $71,200. 

Nearly every amenity is standard on the XKR, with the sole option being the $2,400 navigation system. 

Sportier XKR 
The muscular XKR is sportier than the XK8, which is a little softer. Jaguar upgraded the XKR where necessary to safely handle the 80 extra horsepower and additional torque. 

No Manual Transmission
But, like its sister model, the XKR offers no manual transmission because Jaguar feels demand would be low among the mostly affluent folks who buy these cars. 

As with the XK8, only a 5-speed automatic transmission is available, although the automatic in the XKR is a Mercedes-Benz unit modified by Jaguar to handle the extra horsepower and torque. 

Both engines�especially the supercharged version�produce so much torque that a manual really isn't necessary, and the automatic upshifts smoothly and downshifts crisply. 

Still, it would be nice if a manual gearbox were offered. After all, you can get one in a Porsche, Ferrari and Chevrolet Corvette. 

The gorgeous XK looks much like the legendary Jaguar E-Type sports car of the 1960s and 1970s�commonly called the &quot;XK-E&quot; in this country. 

As with the E-Type, the coupe version of the XK looks the best because its flowing roof lines visually work better with the rest of the body. Still, the convertible looks sportier when its top is down. The power top is easily operated, and the interior is impressively quiet with the top raised. 

The XKR is visually distinguished by its wire-mesh radiator grille, functional hood louvers, small trunk spoiler and 18-inch diameter alloy wheels with Z-rated Pirelli tires. 

Traditional Posh Interior
Both models have Jaguar's traditional sumptuous wood-and-leather interior that coddles occupants. But it isn't easy getting in or out with the low body and wide doorsills. And the bucket seats should provide more side support. 

The front seat is just adequately roomy for tall occupants, and the tiny back seat is useful only for toddlers and small pets. However, the trunk is fairly roomy. 

Both XK models are big, heavy cars. The coupe weighs about 3,800 pounds, and the convertible weighs approximately 4,000 pounds. 

With all that weight, no wonder miles per gallon are low for what is essentially a 2-seater; figure on the low to mid-teens in the city and in the low 20s on the highway. 

Fun to Drive
But these cars feel lighter and nimbler than their weights would suggest. Steering is quick and the supple all-independent suspensions provide Jaguar's typically comfortable ride�although the XKR has a firmer ride and its steering feels slightly heavier. Handling is quite good, helped by a traction control system. 

The pedal for the powerful anti-lock brake system is too soft on both models, and the convertible has steering column shake and judder on bumpy roads. But XK models are pretty solidly built and far more reliable than older Jaguars, thanks to Ford's ownership of the company. 

The XK8 should suit most buyers just fine, but the XKR is far more impressive.
