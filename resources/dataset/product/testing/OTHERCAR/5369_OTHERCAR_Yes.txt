            I would highly recommend a Nissan Sentra to anyone thinking of buying a used car. My parents bought one used back in the early 80's and it has over 200,000 miles on it and nothing has ever had to be done to it. Besides the obvious, oil, tires etc. Then in 1995 I got my first car. it was a 1994 Nissan Sentra. I have been through so much with this EXCELLENT little car. I did a year on a paper route. Over 150 miles each night and never once did it let me down. I hit a deer in it last year and all it needed was a good washing and a front end alignment. It now has 148,000 miles on it and it still runs great. I would recommend a Sentra to anyone.<br><br>
