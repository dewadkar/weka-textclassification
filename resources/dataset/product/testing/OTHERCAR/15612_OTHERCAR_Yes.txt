            Digital photography has a great attraction baby boomers:  Instant Gratification!  Like a polaroid, you get to see the picture instantly, but if you don't like it, you haven't wasted any film as with traditional instant photography--you just delete the picture and shoot again.  

What attracted me to the Sony line of digital cameras was the storage media, regular 3 1/2 inch floppy disks.  The disk pops in the side of the camera and each disk can hold a dozen or more pictures.  Other digital cameras use media which may individually hold more pictures but which cost significantly more, flash memory cards for example.  Floppy disks cost next to nothing and pictures can easily transferred to a computer by popping the disk in the drive and loading the the picture file into a graphics program.  There are no cables or special hookups required.

My wife and I took the camera and a couple of dozen floppies to Mexico on vacation and while there happened on a storefront internet access provider that rented computers for $1 for 1/2 hour.  I stopped in and loaded a couple of the floppies into the computer and e-mailed pictures of us enjoying ourselves in the sun to our winter-bound friends in the Northeast.  That alone was worth the somewhat stiff price for the camera (we paid about $850).

We bought the MVC-FD91 model, which was the top of the line at the time.  It was a bit bulkier and heavier than the other models Sony made but it had more features and gave us greater flexibility.  The camera also takes mini-movies, about 60 seconds will fit on a single disk, and records sound as well as motion.  The pictures are not as crisp as with 35 millimeter film but for the average vacation they are fine.  Plus, if you want to sell on eBay or any of the other auction sites, you really need to be able to display images of the items you are selling and the digital camera alternative is superior to regular film processing and then scanning a picture.

The Sony MVC-FD91 offers a lot of flexibility, has very low media costs, uses media which are universally available if you need more and, most important, is a lot of fun!<br><br>
