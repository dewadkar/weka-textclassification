            If you are tempted to buy this car, Spare your self the potential aggravation and run for the hills instead!.  Long story short, We bought this car used, at carmax (excellent dealer, btw).  I was astute enough to purchase the extended warranty, and i have to say that was the wisest, recent investment decision i have made.  weve accumulated nearly 3 grand in warranty covered repairs on this car, and it hasnt even punched through 50k miles yet.  whats gone wrong?  A/C compressor, parts fell off car, 800+ in repairs;  Brakes, total failure and replacement of rear system,  Cooling system failures (2x), over 1,500 in cost.  

I find the quality of finish on this vehicle to be poor.  The rear bench seat stanchions (bases) have exposed, sharp metal edges that are nearly razor sharp.  they lacerated my son's knee when he was about 4, now he's scarred for life.  Those elements should have been covered with plastic shrouds like they are on some of the japanese vans.  

The rear bench seats are removable, but you have to have herculean strength to pull them out.  That is, if you dont first shred your hands using the release mechanisms while trying to disengage them from the floor tracks.  Ive started keeping leather gloves in the van for that task.

Some of the component quality in this car is decent, however most is poor, in my own humble opinion.  I challenge any Chrysler executive that gives a damn about their customer to write me and explain / justify the shortcomings of this car, until then I will tell everyone i see to run from this brand.  Americans should not have to subsidize the survival of a company that makes such a poor product.
