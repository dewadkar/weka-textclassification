            So, this camera is a bit long in the tooth at this point but I went and bought it anyway about 6 months ago, used on EBay. One knock on the camera if the serial port download of pictures but I use a laptop PCMCIA card and downloads are a snap. If you have a desktop with a USB port go for the $30 and buy a CF card reader. 

Not being a professional photographer, I was looking for the best quality pictures at the most affordable price. You can read reviews until you're blue in the face, which I did, but let me tell you this camera takes great pictures. I had my choice narrowed down to the newer Canon Digitals and the Pro 70. Being a cheapskate, I will share with you that when looking for a camera seriously consider the power source, and the Pro 70 is all inclusive. Most cameras do not provide rechargeable batteries or DC adapter, these are extras. Downloading pictures is a resource drain so you have the choice of spending $100 in batteries in a very short time or going for the $100 for the optional power source up front. It's SLR styling is perfect for those that like conventional cameras, and the lens is large, the reason the pics are so good. You will need an additional flash but I bought mine for 550 with a Canon 220 ex speedlite, Lowepro bag and an additional 120 meg CF Card. I'm very happy with my camera and highly recommend it for the price.<br><br>
