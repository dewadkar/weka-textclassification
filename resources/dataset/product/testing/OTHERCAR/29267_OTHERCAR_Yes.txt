            First off I purchased the vehicle for $34,500 in June of 2003. I also took $3,500 in rebates to bring it down to ($31,000). I also utilized the GM supplier discount. The discount is not that great but saves you on destination charges and a little off the top (maybe 10% off of MSRP). You could probably negotiate as good of a deal since the 2004s are coming out soon. The package was the XL SLE Enhanced package(Ontstar, Power seats, heated mirrors) and Comfort Package (~1,650 combined).  I also upgraded the axle ratio to improve gas mileage ($50), side curtain airbags ($375), DVD entertainment system ($1000), Polished wheels ($495), CD changer ($245), and the locking differential($270).  The total options package was $4,425.

Without a doubt this was the smoothest riding of the SUV's my wife and I test drove.  I am including the ML 320, Trailblazer, Expedition, RX 300, 4Runner, Durango.  The turning ratio is great which makes the vehicle much easier to park.

Without the leather seat package, the interior is a textured dark pewter rather than the fake wood.  I am not a big fan of the fake wood and would have gotten the leather package if I could have changed that fact.  The cloth is nice and the seats are still very comfortable.  You forgo the heated seats, however, which is sometimes very nice.

The stereo system is kicking and the 6 disc in-dash is nice. My only complaint is that XM is not an option so your only hope for XM is to add an aftermarket FM modular kit which will run you about $350 installed (I did it).  

Room galore when you fold down the third and second row seating.  Plenty of room for 2 sets of golf clubs in back even when the third seat is up.

I must say--this vehicle will turn some heads.  The styling is unique and sophisticated.  Mine is black and I love the solar dark tinted windows.  It is nice to help keep the heat buildup down in the summer.  The rear AC system is the best of the SUVs I drove.  They can control their own fan speed and temperature (if you choose to let them from the front!). The second and third rows both have overhead vents which blow out some serious air.  This you know is nice if you have ever been stuck in the backseat of an SUV without overhead air vents.  The front has dual climate control to end age old debate of who controls the temperature.

I have the 275 horse power V6 (more horses than Fords V8).  Plenty for me with only a small trailer and no boat.  My heavier friends will be adequately transported as well.

Drawbacks are the relatively low clearance (full 2 inches less than most in the class).  Front and rear partial skid plates do help if you are worried about underbody damage if you go off road.  The AutoTrac 4wd drive system gives you plenty of options (2wd, AWD, 4hi, 4lo).

I could go on...you get the picture though.  Finally an American SUV with style and performance.
