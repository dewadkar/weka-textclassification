            When I was searching for a minivan to purchase with my father we were looking for something spacious that was more van like than car like.  We found what we wanted in the Chevy Astro.

It was spacious but that was just about it.  Soon after we purchased this minivan everything started to break.  And I mean everything.  First went the motors that controlled the power windows. We had those replaced twice so far and now they need to be replaced again along with the wiring for them.  Then the air conditioning system stopped working.  Then the handle that opens the minivan door broke so when the sliding door is locked in place so that the door doesn't slide when parked on a hill, it has to be pulled closed from the inside.  we had that replaced and in about 2 weeks it broke again.  Soon after that, those things(I apologize for my lack of car vocabulary but you get the picture) that hold up the hatch in the back gave out.  Now the windshield wipers stopped working.  Also when driving in rain, if a moderate amount of water touches the underside of the engine, the digital display that shows what gear you are in and your trip counter blank out until it dries.

This car was bought in 1998 used.  It's a Chevy 1996 and the mileage on it was low and we haven't driven on it very much(because it spends a good amount of the time in the shop).  Most of these problems started to occur shortly after we bought it and they haven't stopped since.

Just so you don't think my mechanic is taking me to the cleaners, I have had this car repaired at various auto shops including Chevrolet authorized auto shops.

This car isn't worth the investment no matter how much you like it.  When speaking with other Chevy Astro/GMC Safari(the Astro's Sister Car) the results were the same no matter what year the car was.  

I don't recommend this car to anybody.  Think long and hard before investing $20,000 in a car that will spend most of the time in the shop.<br><br>
