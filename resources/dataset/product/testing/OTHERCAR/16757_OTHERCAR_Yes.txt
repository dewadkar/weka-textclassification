            I purchased this for $399.  There are other Sony options for cheaper, but then you lose megapixel resolution, or they use alkaline batteries, inferior video clips, etc.

After scrutinizing other cameras (Kodak, Fuji, Canon), this one had all of the features I wanted and then some, all within my limit of $400.  After getting it home, the battery was charged within a couple of hours, and I was easily taking pictures and navigating the camera software.  Shortly thereafter I installed the USB drivers on my Windows system with no problems at all.  Download was extremely quick and I was viewing them in seconds.

Here are the specifics of why this model has it all:
- Great jpg images with strong, warm colors
- High resolution mpeg video clips (VGA) with sound
- 3x optical/3x digital zoom
- rechargeable lithium battery
- USB 1 AND USB 2 support
- full feature set: multiple image filters and settings, white balance settings, flash control settings, etc.
- great Sony style: sleek and ultra compact
- great user interface: both the camera body buttons and camera software are easy to use, informative display with remaining pictures or battery life
- 1.5" high quality LCD display
- 3.2 megapixel (perfect for most users, can print high quality photos up to 8"x10")

I would recommend a couple of areas for improvement: the camera comes with no bag or case and the 16MB memory stick only allows about 8 images at the highest 3MP setting, otherwise 24 at a more common 1MP setting.  Also, the battery life is average, but not bad.

You may also notice many stores still selling the P7 and just getting the P8, usually for the same price.  So you'll ask yourself, what's the difference?

Basically the P8 is the newly released version of the P7 with some key improvements: VGA video clips and USB2 support.  Some other minor improvements include a camera width that is about 1/2" shorter, camera "cursor" buttons that are easier to manage, a quick pic delete button, slight better digital zoom at lower resolutions, support for memory stick pro, a better right hand front face grip, and prob a few other minute details.

Thumbs up to Sony on this latest product.
