                 I have had the privilege of owning a 91 Toyota Camry.  I easily began to fall in love with this car.  It is very dependable, and I love the sunroof.  We have put over 150,000 miles on this car and it is still very efficient.  It can accelerate fairly rapidly.  I remember when I was in high school, I was allowed to take my mom's Camry out on the town.  I was the happiest boy in school.  I remember sitting at every red light trying to race every car that stopped next to me in my extremely cool (but borrowed) car.  

     The Toyota Camry is really a family car.  Sure teenagers may get a kick out of driving them but the parents are the ones who benefit the most.  The Camry has a pretty big trunk and it excels in safety standards.  The seats are very comfortable as I have stated before we have traveled alot in this car.  The Camry has included some features that I now expect in every car but I never find them.  It has a nice unlocking feature so that when you unlock the passenger side door all the other doors become unlocked.  This makes sense and is just one of the many perks I have found in the Camry.  

     I also really support Toyota because they can make cars that will stay out of the repair shop for a long time.  This has always been something I have counted on with the 91 Camry that I owned and it never failed me.  

     Of course, there are the usual things that need replacing after so many miles but if its well-maintained than you shouldn't have to replace alternators, engines, or anything else that can become very costly.  I have owned other cars that I have had to either frequently replace those parts or sell the piece of junk for another car.  The repairmen for a certain type of car began to know me personally because I would have to bring in my old car so frequently.  However, the repairmen that work on Toyota's hardly know who I am because I have not had as many problems as any of the previous cars that I have dealt with. <br><br>
