            I actually got to drive one!

A used Rt/10 1996 model. As I read this on my list of things to do, this one stood out. But I see many people
Raise thier nose to the viper due to its qualities and 
Particulars.  

The history of the Dodge Viper is outstanding. When it
was first introduced by dodge as the pace car in 1992
Driven by none other the Carol Shelby himself, people
Stood up and took notice. Dodge's top of the line sports
car was truly absent from the days of the muscle cars
and it suddenly returned kicking and screaming. It only
Took 2 years from that day until it reached full scale production in 1994. The Viper's mission as handed down by Chrysler was simple: Make a true american legend. Stick a huge motor in it, a drivers seat, and figure out the rest later. The Rt/10 Remained Identical to its pace car brother and was designed from the races, ironically as Dodge has only now returned to the track. (Other then drag racing)

The viper is constructed on a tubular steel chassis just like its nascar counterparts. 

Its engine is a whopping 7,900cc (8.0L) V-10 engine. With its 6 speed transmission, it is capable of launching the viper to its top speed of 160mph (With an electronic limit, Id hate to see it go without it!) which is nominal for a 450 hp - 455ft/lbs of torque. The engines design is a Chysler Cumminham V8 with 2 more cylenders drafted on for good measure.

The exterior of the viper is one of its most interesting traits as the viper carries most of its design from its smaller counterparts. Headlights from the Intrepid concept, rear brakelights from the Stealth R/T. Its body is constucted to be lightweight mostly made of fiberglass and plastics. Nascar again?

The interior is perhaps the viper's main downside. It is particularialy small space. Earlier viper owners make thier claims and screams to Dodge asking for real windows and not plastic ones the velcro to the door. Yes. Older vipers did not have side windows. Since then Chrysler has remdied the problem. Basic instruments, and not much else. The driver tends to sit on a slight angle with the viper's huge transmission strapped in between the driver and passgenger. Seating is comfortable, but controls are often difficult to reach due to the viper's odd interior dimensions.

Onto the drive.

The viper is a loud brute, as all sports coupes with an engine this big should be. As I drive through the small town of Petawawa (Pop 15,000) heads turn. Although there are 2 dealerships in the area, Vipers are unheard of here. Driving through the city is very strange. Shifting to second gear is useless as the viper easily hits 60mph in first gear. The viper sticks to 90' corners like glue. I head to the highway. 

Entering the offramp I slowly give the viper more fuel and it growls with a pitch that would best resemble something from the dinousar age. I floor the viper as soon as I get to the end of the acceleration lane and it snarls and its huge tires spin. It takes no time to get to the 75 mph speed limit. And to make it funny, im using 3rd gear as overdrive. This car has a lot of pure power and isnt forgiving as I downshift to return, the tail slides out crazily. A heart attack almost happens and its brought home.

Another downside is that I didnt get to keep it. And to further the dismay, the car ate 1/4 tank of gas in my short jaunt. This snake has a hefty appitite. For gas and ashpalt.
