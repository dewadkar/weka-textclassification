            I bought my 4dr,4wd,5spd,fully loaded tracker in May of 1998. I needed a second source of transportation for my work. After two years and 24,000 miles, my views on this mini suv are all favorable. It gets 27mpg with a combo of city and highway driving. Not too bad for a 4wd. Off road, it performs rather well for a small vehicle (yes you can actually take it there). I have taken it deep into the mountains and never felt uneasy. I live in the Northeast and in the snow it performs very well in 4wd, but in 2wd it is horrible (not heavy enough in the rear end). Except for one small oil leak from a loose plug in the transmission, I have not had any unscheduled maintenance done. The ride, given such a short wheelbase, is somewhat harsh on rough street driving (it doesn't absorb the potholes smoothly). The interior volume is not bad for a couple of adults and their baggage. I have sat in the rear seats before and they are comfortable to ride in, but I wouldn't want to travel cross country back there. I have traveled short distances with four adults and no one ever complains.  Overall, the interior gives me the feeling of being in a larger truck than the Tracker actually is (feels like you sit much higher off the ground). People like the way my Tracker looks. I added chrome wheels, roof rack, chrome pinstripes, a hood visor, and window vent visors. It makes it stand out a little from other Trackers. The engine does as good of a job as you would expect from 95 horses. &quot;It is no rocket ship&quot;, but it does an adequate job. I would definitely suggest the 5spd though. All in all I have been very satisfied with my Tracker.<br><br>
