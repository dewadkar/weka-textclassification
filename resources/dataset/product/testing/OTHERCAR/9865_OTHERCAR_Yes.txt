            After my wife owning a 1990 Toyota with 195,000 great miles, we went looking for a new, larger SUV.
We looked at the Toyota Sequoia, GMC&#146s, Chevy&#146s and Cadi&#146s. We test drove all and measured most ( as I am kind of a geek )
We even took the Cadi for a 24 hr. test drive. Now don&#146t get me wrong, we liked many thing about each and found the Cadi. to be really plush, but after all was said and done, we dropped $50 K on the Toyota. WOW, I still can&#146t believe they get that much for a Toy.
Now for the good news, we love it! And we are confident that we made the right choice.
Sure the mileage is So So, but we were only getting about 16 MPG with the 1990  4runner.
We just went from Sacramento CA to Lake Tahoe and back and we got 19.3 MPG&#133.  That&#146s better than my Diesel Truck. If you push it really hard in the city you still get 12 MPG. If you baby it you can get 17 in town. We love the feel of the Toyota, we believe that it will last well over 200,000 mi. (even though we bought the extended warrantee ) and we just feel great driving around in it. 
Last night I took it to our local 4x4 park and did a bit of 4 wheeling. Mild stuff mind you but still it was full on 4x4.  WOW !!!  It really impressed me and a few of the locals too. Very tight, great traction and a total feeling of confidence. I would take it off road more often if it did not cost 50k&#133 but it is nice to know that we can.
As far as interior dimensions, it is by far much more room than all the others (in the shorter versions) and the exterior is way shorter than the full size Cadi and Suburban. We just wish the 3rd row seats would fold down like the Ford, but we certainly would not buy the Ford.
We got the DVD and like it for the kids, the leather feels like it will hold up much better than the Chevy / GMC.
The Cadi had the best leather but we just did not feel right in a Cadi. It also had way more whistles and bells but would have been about 12K more. The Stereo is awesome. The air cond. is totally adequate ( Sacramento is a very hot place) blind spot is no big thing ( lots of people complained about the blind spot, but I drive a full size truck too) one of the only things I did not like was that the arm rests were not that comfortable, but I have gotten used to them. Seats are great too. Sun roof nice ( and pretty quite)
So if you are looking for a full sized SUV , for us this is the one to get&#133 Oh By the way, the resale is way higher for the Sequoia too&#133  E Mail us if you have questions  proparoo@worldnet.att.net
