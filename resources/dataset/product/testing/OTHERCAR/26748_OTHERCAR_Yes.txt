            Before I bought this camera I had a similar digital camera from the Olympus called the D-340R. Though this is the same as far as quality is concerned with 1.3 Megapixels; it offers much better control (more buttons) and a better lens that can zoom in for close up shots. The only downside which is very small is that when closing the camera, you hit the lens and have to wait for it to retract before you can finish closing. This is not that big of an issue, but nonetheless it is something that bothers me.

The camera came preinstalled with an 8MB memory card which is not enough to do anything with so I would recommending buying an additional 32 or 64 MB memory card. The resolution is 1260X960 which produces a fine colorful picture. In fact, I have compared the output to a number of 3.3 megapixel cameras and to be honest, I don't see the price difference of those higher priced cameras worth the cost. This camera will work fine for most users and unless you are a professional, I don't think you would need some of the features of the higher end cameras.

This camera is very easy to use. The LCD screen is great for scrolling through and reviewing pictures but if that doesn't satisfy you it even has a cable that can hook to a standard RCA jack on your TV or VCR to review pictures quickly and amaze family and friends. It hooks up to your computer through a serial port so I would recommend either buying a "Smart Media Card Reader" or an HP photosmart printer (they have a smart media card reader built into the printer!) 

The price is very reasonable! I bought my camera for only $299 and have seen a number of them online selling for as low as $199. Its worth the money and though it is only 1.3 megapixels compared to some of the 3.3 megapixel cameras, this camera is would suit most consumers. I have printed several photos on my printer and through online digital development companies and the pictures look way better than my $500 35MM Pentax camera!

I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a easy to use, inexpensive and great quality digital camera.
