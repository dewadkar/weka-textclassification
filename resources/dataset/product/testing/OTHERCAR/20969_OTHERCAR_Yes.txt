            My family purchased this vehicle for the size.
We have twins that are two and a 5 year old and the comfort of this van makes all the difference in the world when you are traveling with or without children.  I use this van for my main car. I have eliminated the hitting and bickering between the kids. I have plenty of room for my double stroller and room for things I purchase when shopping.
The bad thing about it is that it is big and hard for some people to get around in. But, when you get use to it it is great. In the beginning park at the end of rows so you can get use to parking. Soon you will be pulling in any space that is wide enough for you to fit.
I have little children now. But even when we did not have children we loved a conversion van.  We always were the ones to drive every where because our van was the only car that everyone could ride together in and that is nice that you all don't have to take separate cars.
The things I love most about my van is the comfort and room and the things I don't like about my van is the gas mileage. It is about 18/20.
Driving the van on the highway, It can't be beat. It is so comfortable to drive. You don't get cramped. You sit up nice and high and the family is content watching the TV. The ride is smooth.
I recommend it highly to large families and to people who take a lot of trips. I do not think you will be disappointed with your purchase. Unless you use it as your main vehicle. Then you might get tired of always having a large vehicle to drive. My suggestion is to purchase a pre owned van like a couple of years old with low mileage.  You will pay about half the price of a new one.
I can not really give a good comparison to any other vans because this is the only van I would have and it is my third one in 12 years and I only wanted a conversion van you can not beat the comfort and privacy<br><br>
