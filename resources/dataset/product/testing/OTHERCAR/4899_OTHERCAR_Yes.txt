            You're reading this review from Mr. Gadget King himself. I've been using DCs since Kodak first came out with their boxy lo-res 2 series 5 years ago. I've since been hooked on Kodak's 200 series upgrading from 1MB pixel to 2+. I've decided to hold on the 3+MB pixels as I reviewed other models.

And DAMN glad I waited. I was about to get the Kodak 285, then decided on the Nikon 990; but then in the distance I noticed a small but BOLD DC calling to me. It was Sony's DSC-P1!! I was skeptical at first, b/c Sony gets into everything. But I have to hand it to them when it comes to multimedia devices. They are for the most part the DOMINATION of the competition.

This little baby fits in the palm of your hand. Something most other DCs in its class can not claim. It's light and very versatile. It can take stills at many different resolutions as well as MPEG movies. You can select anywhere from 5secs to 15secs. Just point, shoot and tape; then download to your computer via the USB connection and send it off to grandma.

The DSC-P1 also allows for multiple settings for pictures which include sepia, B&W, reverse, solarized, etc.. The image to disk is MUCH faster than the Kodak DCs and the battery life is MUCH longer than the Kodak as well.

The DSC-P1 also allows for editing on the fly. A feature, which I admit, can be wasted if you're not an enthusiast; but in any event, is a BONUS over the Kodak and Nikon.

Overall, if you couldn't tell already, I LOVE MY SONY DSC-P1. I'm actually waiting for the successor to the P1 which should be this summer to feature 4+MB pixels.

Happy shooting....
