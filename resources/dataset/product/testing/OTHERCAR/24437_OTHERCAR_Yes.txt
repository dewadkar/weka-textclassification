This camera runs about $700.00 and can also be found at most large computer stores or ordered directly from Sony. I found the DSC-S50 to be a lot of fun. Not only could I take still photos, but I could also get up to 60 seconds of video using MPEG formatting! The camera can be set up to use memory stick (although I was not using one) and can be used with Sony's digital photo printer. I used the USB interface and hooked the camera directly to the computer. I was really pleased with the ease of use. Sorry to say that this camera, except for the video capabilities was about as good as the DSC-S30 which was priced about $100.00 less.
Stay tuned for more reviews on Digital cameras from Sony Digital Imaging!
