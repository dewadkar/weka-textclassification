            I've owned or used many digital cameras since 1996 and have to say that THIS camera is by far the best I've ever had the pleasure to work with. It overcomes each of the deficiencies that have bugged me over the years:

SHUTTER LAG - Other digitals have unbelievably long and annoying shutter lags, where you press the shutter, and then after some indeterminate period of time, the image is finally captured. Not so this camera: When you press the shutter, you get the image. You can definitely catch the action with this Casio camera!

"BOOT UP" TIME - Other digital cameras can take so darn long to warm up after you turn them on, that you'll never get the photo you want (unless it's posed.) This little camera is ready to take pictures almost as soon as you turn it on.

"WRITE" TIME - Other digital cameras can take too long to record the image to the memory card. It can take forever 'til the camera's ready for the next shot. Not so the Exilim. Soon as you've taken one shot, it's ready to take another.

IMAGE QUALITY - Sharp as a tack with the Pentax zoom lens Casio incorporated in this model. Colors are vivid and bright. Very little graininess (which is a problem I'd experienced big time with the Minolta Dimage X.) Overall, top of the line images are created with this camera!

PORTABILITY - Hey, this Casio camera is one of the smallest on the market, and one of the slimmest. You can always carry it in your shirt pocket so it can go anywhere you go. You never have to say "darn, I wish I had my digital camera with me, just look at that gorgeous sunset" because you'll have your camera with you!

ZOOM LENS - Fast and easy to use, with an excellent visual cue to show you where in the zoom cycle you are at any given focal length.

FLASH - I've seen flashes that are too weak, and flashes that are so strong they always bleach out the subject; but the flash on the Exilim EX-Z3 is just right!

In summary, this camera is high quality, easy to use, fast and portable, takes great pictures, and is tons of fun!

Strengths

Fast start up time, no shutter lag, is ready for the next shot immediately, excellent image quality, user friendly, great zoom, pocketable, quality metal construction, great look and feel, can take up to 30 second AVI videos with sound, automatically downloads photos and videos to hard drive from it's dock; Casio finally got it all together perfectly with this model.
