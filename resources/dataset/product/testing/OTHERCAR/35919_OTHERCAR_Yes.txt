                 I recently went car shopping with a friend with a $5,000 budget looking for the sportiest, best looking car we could find, and the 1991 Normally Aspirated (Non-Turbo) Toyota MR2 won hands down.  MR2 stands for Mid-engined, Rear wheel drive 2 seater.

     The MR2 is a pure sports car.  Although the Normally Aspirated engine only outputs 130 horsepower, it outruns my 192 hp V6 Camry.  This car uses a 4 speed automatic transmission, although a 5 speed manual is the transmission of choice.

     The real shine of the MR2 is in it's handling.  With the engine in the middle and the stiff suspension, it takes a real effort to lose grip on a corner.  The ride is not bad, but you definitely feel the bumps in the road (which I personally prefer to a too-cushy luxury car ride).

     Being a mid-engined two-seater, the insurance on an MR2 is higher than other cars from the price range.  The lack of a back seat is not a big hassle as long as you don't have to transport more than one passenger.  The hood of the car contains the spare tire and battery, and there is a rear trunk that may possibly hold a golf bag, and that's about it.  There are storage areas behind the seats, with little containers on the floorboard, one of which has a lock.  The seats are very comfortable and there is a surprising amount of leg room.

     If your budget and taste is anything like my friend's, I would definitely recommend a Toyota MR2.
