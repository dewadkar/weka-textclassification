            The E-320 is a superb motoring car: it'll remind you of why you once loved to drive. Anyone who plunks down the (sizable) price should immediately plan an extended driving tour, preferably in the west where the highways are empty and the speed limit is 90 mph. This car eats up the road with a sensuous growl, and does it at 30-35 mpg, too. You can sail past emission-spewing SUVs smug in the knowledge that it's also one of the cleanest-burning vehicles in production.

The interior is roomy and cushy, with enough temperature and seat-adjustment controls to make everyone happy, and cup-holders everywhere, including one that must have been some engineering student's Senior Project. It's got enough air-bags and safety features to out-Volvo those pesky station wagons, but resist the urge to ram one.

I rave, but honestly the car induces the kind of exhilaration our grand-parents must have experienced when they hit the open road in their new Model A. So forget that round-the-world cruise. Buy an E-320 and visit Bryce instead. Visit Zion! Visit that college pal who made a pile and bought a spread in Wyoming! (Don't tell him ahead of time what you're driving.)<br><br>
