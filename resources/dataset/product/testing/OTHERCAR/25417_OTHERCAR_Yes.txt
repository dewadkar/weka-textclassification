            I bought the Buick Park Avenue 6 on July 17,1999 and at this
writing the car has put on 7011 miles.
It is by far the best and most comfortable vehicle I have
ever owned.  The handling is excellent and the acceleration
is reasonably good.  I realize that this car would appeal to
more mature drivers than to the younger sporty crowd.
Also it is slightly more difficult to park at metered city
parking spots than a compact car.
My previous car was a Buick Century, which served me well, but
I notice that on longer trips my present vehicle is more
comfortable and doesn't tire me.
Let me mention a few interesting features that are not found
on most vehicles; a key to change miles and Fahrenheit into
the metric system.  This is particularly useful when
traveling in Canada.  Also a little trap-door that enables
one to retrieve items from the trunk from the rear seat.
The rear-view windows are heated; there is a compass; both
inside and outside temperatures are provided.
I would heartily recommend this car.
