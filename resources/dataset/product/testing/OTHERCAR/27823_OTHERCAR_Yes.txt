            I remember that Automobile magazine arriving...there, on the cover was a red roadster in 3/4 view...oooh, so pretty. And even better- a Japanese roadster at that. I owned a Toyota ( you could shoot bullets through the engine and it would keep running) that had saved me from a cursed Fiat existence. At that moment, this roadster-a Miata- drove itself straight into my heart (ouch).
Thanks to my dad, I grew up with a love of cars- and I gravitated toward those pocket-rocket small European machines that we'd see at racetracks like Watkins Glen. For years, I stood by, wishing to the heavens that I was 16, and watch my dad &amp; brother (endlessly) tinkering with the cars that came in &amp; out of our lives; Triumphs, Fiats, Renaults...and someday I knew I had to have a roadster of my very own. 
Flash forward to 1999...10 years of my carrying around that cover with the MX-5 (Miata) on it...every department I worked in; every job I had; there it was, displayed on my bulletin board, and now my husband and I were about to purchased a 1991 BRG model that was lovingly cared for!
We have been very fortunate- we were able to purchase a car that for most people is looked upon as a trifle, a toy. But we bought used, paid a reasonable price, and we don't spend money...we're not shopping mavens, we &quot;save our pennies&quot;, we're reasonably prudent, and our other cars are two old, beaten &amp; abused (but reliable) basic-transportation types that get tons 'o' mileage.
The verdict?
This car has lived up to every review I absorbed- every glowing statement written about them has rung true. Too often today, cars resemble a living room on wheels; no feel of the road, no handling, and worst of all, no manual transmission. Our Miata allows us to feel the open road- enjoying the sensation of total control through a turn, wind in your hair, whipping around those lovely short-shifting gears. If you love to drive, I highly recommend the Miata. There are NO other sports cars available in the price range that have been as consistent. The car's a winner. <br><br>
