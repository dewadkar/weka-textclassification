              Since the start of the Bavarian Motor Works, I have always believed they have made great cars.  They have nice leather interior these days, with an exterior sporty look and the feel of some power behind you when handling the car.
  The BMW 330 series is a good car, but does not live up to the standards that I think BMW is capable of.  I drove one myself, took it on an off road driving course, and did some analyzing of my own.
  I came to a couple conclusions.  Yes, this is a very nice car, but I still believe it is overpriced.  The first thing that caught my mind was the turning radius.  This car does not compete with the C class Mercedes handling abilities as well as the Acura Type R's.  Also the room on the inside is another factor.  When I pay 35 grand for a 4 person car, I want you to feel comfortable.  In this car, you feel more like your in a 1998 Ford Taurus.  
  What I did like about this car was it is very fast.  For the money your paying, it better be very luxurious or fast.  It has a nice leather interior, and a nice trimmed dashboard.  The rims are high quality stocked goods, and it has the sporty look on the outside.
  Still, I would rather keep that extra 12 grand, buy a brand new supped up Acura Integra that has better handling than this car, and use that money for other reasons.  This is a good car if you like the sporty look and the bragging rights that you have a 'beamer'.  Besides that, I could find a lot better cars for the price.
