            Yesterday I was having my 1994 Cadillac DeVille serviced at the local dealership. I decided to take a look at the new and used vehicles on the lot while I waited for my car. One car that caught my eye was a 1999 Cadillac Seville SLS. This particular example had 25,698 miles on the odometer. The asking price was $27,500 which is $100 less than average retail per research. My 1994 DeVille is in excellent condition. However, it has 87,200 miles on it and I'm at the point where I can either trade it while it is still worth something or keep it until I run it into the ground. The Seville SLS is a tempting choice. 

This particular example was finished in striking Pearlescent White - a special factory finish. It was shod with P235/60R16 Michelin blackwall tires mounted to the optional chromed rims. The interior was natural beige leather trimmed with genuine zebrano wood trim. Not only did the interior look rich, it smelled rich. 

The SLS is powered by the standard Northstar 4.6 litre V-8 giving 275 hp @ 5600 RPMs and a stump-wrenching 300 ft/lbs of torque. The Northstar in the STS gives an awesome 300 hp. This is 75 and 100 more hp than the 4.9 litre V-8 in my standard 1994 DeVille. The engine is mated to a standard 4-speed automatic with overdrive in both the SLS and STS. 

What can I say about the Seville's styling except that it's exponentially attractive. In my opinion, the Cadillac Seville from 1992 to present is the most beautiful car on the market. The Seville was slightly redesigned in 1998. I kind of like the older 1992 to 1997 design's details better but the current design is still a knock-out. 

Out back is a longitudinal brake light along the top edge of the decklid. It consists of LEDs instead of incandecent bulbs - a precursor to the LED taillight assemblies found on the 2000 to present DeVille. One must ensure that all the LEDs in the brakelight are working when looking at a used example. Too many times have I been behind a contemporary Seville with half the brakelight LEDs burned-out. 

The interior of the Seville is up there with the world's best - finished in rich leather and a generous helping of genuine wood trim. The driver faces a bank of Lexus-esque analog instruments along with plethora of minor displays that shows average fuel economy, oil life and even transmission fluid life among other data. 

Redundant controls for the HVAC sytem and radio are on the steering wheel spokes. There is no telescoping option but a tilt. Unfortunately the tilt is via a somewhat crude lever which seems a little disturbing compared to the electrically operated tilt on Lexus and Mercedes. Another unusual touch was that controls for the windshield wipers and washer were on a stalk on the right side of the steering wheel whereas they have been on the left side on my DeVille. The ignition switch is on the instrument panel instead of the steering column in an effort to thwart thieves. There is also an auto-dimming rearview mirror with electronic compass.

The HVAC and radio controls were very intuitive. It took me no effort to figure out how to use them. Climate control is via a rubberized knob to set the interior temperature between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The A/C was efficient and effective as it rapidly cooled the car which was sitting locked on the blacktop on a hot late summer day. The Delco-Bose AM/FM stereo with standard CD and cassette gave crisp clear sound. I have always been happy with GM's factory radios since I bought my 1989 Cadillac Brougham and this one didn't disappoint me. Even the unit in my girlfriend's new base-model Chevrolet Impala is excellent. 

The seats were very comfortable and in no way did I feel cramped despite the fact the Seville is a somewhat smaller car than my DeVille. The seats felt as if they were tailor made to form-fit my body. Unfortunately the seat controls were mounted on the sides of the seat rather than on the doors as they are on my DeVille. One must grope to find them.

I took this car on an extended trip on all types of roads from urban streets to the open interstate. This car handled so well that it felt as if the car was glued to the pavement. If the SLS was this good, the STS must be on par with a Formula-1 racer. The car even handled aggressive turns with a lot of grace - something I can't say about my 1994 DeVille and a quantum leap over that of my 1989 Brougham. Braking distances were short and smooth. Acceleration was seamless. 

Despite its smaller size, there is still plenty of space in the trunk. There is even a pass-through for long, thin cargo. However, there were two things I didn't like. The automatic pull-down that I've had on every Cadillac I've owned since a 1975 Sedan DeVille was missing and it had a super-stupid cost...er I mean "space-saver" tire! What the hell do you have to buy to get a genuine full-size spare these days? The space-saver tire should be an embarrassment to Cadillac and any other respectable maker of luxury cars. 

All and all the 1999 Cadillac Seville is an irresistible choice. As a used car it is a downright bargain compared to other luxury makes. I looked at a 1998 Lexus LS400 with 34,000 miles on it and it was $7,000 more. I'm not sure I'm going to go through with a purchase due to the horrific recent events in NYC and Washington, but I'll provide Epinion viewers an updated report should I make the plunge.
