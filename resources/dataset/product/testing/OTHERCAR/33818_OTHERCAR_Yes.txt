            This is my first Digital Camera.

I originally went to OfficeMax to purchase more paper for my printer. I stopped to browse at the Digital Cameras because I knew that at some point in my life ( Like Now ), I was going to own a digital camera.

I didn't know to much about them but I saw this Canon PowerShot A50, selling for $199.00. I checked all the features and found it had all the features I wanted. It takes pictures at 1280x960 resolution as well as 640x960. It has a zoom that is a 2x zoom which is equivalent to 28mm wide angle to 70mm close up, It can be set to any zoom between those settings. There is a Built in Flash that can be shut off in programmable mode. It comes with an 8 Meg CF card that stores your pictures as you take them, The 8 Meg card can store 106 Small pics at low resolution, 61 small pics at Fine resolution, 43 large pics at low resolution or 23 Large pics at Fine resolution.This camera also boasts of a 1 5/8&quot; x 1 3/16&quot; LCD viewer to preview pictures or view the pictures you took.When you turn the button to Lock, it shuts down all power use and automatically stores the zoom lens in the camera and then closes a metal door over the lens. This is a great feature.

I have not tried all the gadgets yet but it will occupy some happy moments trying all the features. The stitch feature will be my next experiment. With the stitch mode you can take a series of panorama shots and the stitch mode locks them together to form a large panorama. I have every confidence it will work very well as did all the things I played with.

The only draw backs that I know of are the fact that instructions on how to use the menu in programmable mode are a bit skimpy, also The instructions for setting up the camera gave me a scare so bad that I took the camera back to OfficeMax for a refund. The instructions said to &quot;Charge the battery pack NB-5H before installing it in the camera&quot;, the camera came with a 2CR5 battery pack and no charger or NB-5H battery.

I assumed that there were parts missing and took it back, the store said that the charger and re-chargeable battery were optional. I got my money back and went shopping again looking for another camera. I soon found out that the battery supplied with the camera (2CR5) is the standard camera battery sold in drug stores and camera shops. After I realized that it became clear that while the 2CR5 battery can be purchased and used instead of the chargeable NB-5H batteries the re-chargeable is obviously the most economical choice if you are going to shoot many pictures. The 2CR5 batteries are available at BJ's Wholesale house for $10.99 for a pack of 2 batteries, they also have the Canon Charger (DK 110 Power supply)with 1 NB-5H battery for $79.95.

I went back to OfficeMax and bought back the camera that I had returned and went to BJ's and immediately bought the DK 110 Power supply with battery.

My recommendation is to run, don't walk before this fabulous camera and bargain are gone.<br><br>
