            <b><i>My First Car</i></b>
The first car I ever owned was a 1992 Honda Prelude Si, and let me tell you this car is one heck of a sweet ride! It's got everything you could ask for from a sports car in it's price range. If you are a sports car fan, and lucky enough to find one of these babies, in excellent to near mint condition, don't pass on the opportunity because it's a steal at it's current market value. 

All Power Features, sunroof and cruise control are available. Standard Si's come with a/c am/fm cassette deck, and manual features. Manual and automatic transmissions are available, but you will only be cheating yourself if you buy this car in an automatic version.

<b><i>Cruising along in your automobile</i></b>
With it's smooth contours and sleek exterior, you will no doubt turn a few heads cruising along Collins Ave or wherever you choose to show this baby off. You'll have all the comfort you need riding in the front.There is plenty of space because of the short design of the dash and the extremely small space for the two back seats. 

Because of the design of the dash you won't be able to put anything there while you drive or it will just slide off. The glove box is pretty much non-functional. You can store a couple maps but that's about it. To correct the storage problem there is a locking console on the middle of the back seat. 

The back seats themselves are quite uncomfortable and because of the lack of space the only ones who might have some comfort in them are small children. Even then you will probably have to adjust the front seats a bit forward to provide some legroom in the back. There is basically no headroom unless your under five feet tall.


<b><i>Some More Cruising</i></b>
The speedometer says 140 but her top speed is 128, still not too shabby. The acceleration is quick and to the point. The power steering is quite smooth and easy to handle. The shifting (manual transmission) is very very smooth and a short throw between gears so you may be tempted to redline her, but please do not do this on public streets or highways. Once you get going you won't want to stop. She only carries a 2.2 liter, 4 cylinder engine but she still packs a lot of power. 


<b><i>Road Trip!</i></b>
If it's just you and and your girlfriend/wife or boyfriend/husband this is a fun car to cruise down the highway in. Sure it's going to be a little bit noisy inside but it's a sports car, so it's to be expected. It's not too bad until you get near 65-70 mph. Then you'll start hearing a lot more rush of air. If the noise annoys you, that's probably good on a road trip. Maybe it will influence you to keep your speed to the speed limit, since everything else about this car might influence you not too keep it down. There are troopers on the turnpike hiding behind them there trees! 

Another reason for only using this car to travel with two people is that you won't have space for four people's items in the trunk but there is ample room for the items of two people. The right side back seat also has a feature that allows it to fold down from the trunk. This will allow you to fit certain items that wouldn't normally make it in your trunk to be placed there.


<b><i>Safety</i></b>
This car comes with the obvious features like seatbelts and all, but there is also a driver's side airbag and anti-lock-brakes which are nice too. Unfortunately I was rear ended several times in this car. (I'll never buy a red car again, they attract too many distracted drivers, and of course cops.) 

Luckily everything turned out okay and I was never seriously hurt. I always wore my seatbelt though, and the ones in this car worked I am glad to say. The airbag never deployed in any accident I was involved in but I was never hit head on either. I can pretty much say you will be safe in this car in an accident if you are wearing your seatbelt. You don't have to expect any faulty things happening in an emergency. This is true for rear-end collisions. I can not comment on head-on collision since I was fortunate enough not to experience one of these in this car. 

<b><i>A Fore Gone Conclusion</i></b>
This car is awesome. It has style, power, handling and it's simply a blast to drive. Anyone who hasn't had the privilege of driving one of these Japanese auto's doesn't know what they're missing! If you're looking for an awesome sports car at a great bargain, this is a car to test drive. It was a bit pricey new, but it's  current market values are definitely in the consumer's favor.
