            I've been wanting a digital camera for quite a while, and last Christmas I finally got one. A Kodak DC215. Now I always use it. It's got incredible resolution, with amazing capabilities. There is a timer button, so you can jump into the picture, a live mode, so you can see like a video camera on the LCD monitor... It's got zoom features, too. After capturing the photo, you can see it in the camera in review, where you can zoom in, see it in full view, or delete it, before loading it onto you computer. You can change prefreneces such as quick view, brightness, quality, or resolution. As soon as I opened this gift I started exploring its capabilites and taking photos right away. After uploading the photos I printed them out and gave them to my relatives. This was definiately one of my favourite gifts I've ever gotten.<br><br>
