            Do you notice in SUV ads, no one compares their model against the Discovery? It's because dollar for dollar no one match the outstanding value of a Land Rover Discovery. 

Coming in at just under thirty thousand, I was able to pick up a two year old top of the line Discovery in June of 1997 that was still under factory warranty until Mar 2001 (Or fifty three thousand miles). Included on this SUV I had the following options: Leather seats, wood dash accents, six disc cd changer with built in subwoofers, heated front seats, jump seats in the rear, trailer hitch, running boards, full brush guards, driving lamps, rear ladder, dual sun roofs, air conditioning for each set of seats, auto dimming rear view mirror, power seats, dual temperature controls. Included standard with all Discoverys is a V-8 engine and full time four wheel drive. I am probably leaving a lot of stuff out, there is so much to this car that I would have to have a brochure in front of me to fully describe the level of comfort, safety and lifestyle that this car offers. It is safe to say that this was the top of the line American Discovery in 1997 (other than the special editions such as the Camel Trophy edition that had more off-road enhancements in exchange for luxury items).

I would have to step down to part time four wheel drive and a six cylinder on most other SUVs to meet this price. And I would loose alot of comfort and features too. I did shop for Jeeps (Which can't meet the British interior, Jeeps feature too much plastic and look like they take all design queues from '70s era AMC cars inside!) and the X-terra (Which had more then a few design nods towards the Land Rover to start with. The X-terra was too cramped up front, and the price itself skyrockets as you add comparative features to the Rover. Personally, a 1987 Isuzu Trooper is a better designed SUV then an X-terra, which is WAY too much style over actual design thought!) 

Off road, no stock SUV comes close to a stock Land Rover. End of story. Read any real off road magazine and the only stock off-road SUVs praised are the Rovers and an occasional Amigo. Jeeps can only dream of the places a stock Rover can climb!

On road, the Rover is very confident. It sits high, so you have great visibility on freeways. The stock tires are a bit noisy, but changing them to a less aggressive tread fixes that and makes the cockpit as quiet as a Sunday afternoon. It corners well, and accelerates faster than anyone really needs - Especially from a dead still up a steep hill. It's not the best 'round town car, but more than acceptable.

Other then untouchable off-road skills, the Land Rover shines equally in all areas. There are other SUVs that are nicer inside - but cost more. There are others that have better on-road handling - but at expense to price and off-road ability. The Land Rover is the true spiritual ancestor to my 1987 Isuzu Trooper, which means it can more than handle anything you throw at it in true style. And unlike an 87 Trooper (The greatest utility SUV ever made) it has power to spare, real class inside and out and offers you to take part in the true Rover lifestyle.

Plus my Rover just looks classy as I let it roll into the parking garage. I hate to admit it, but it's just classy looking. It has a sophisticated look (Dark blue with full brush guards all the way around, even on the small lights in the back) but still looks somewhat mean and ready to go anywhere - anytime. 

The minor design problems I have with the car itself were all addressed with the Series II. The series II is slightly longer, giving more cargo room. The jump seats in a series II face the forward where mine face inwards. There is a track down button mounted on the steering wheel for the cd player, mine curiously will only allow you to advance in tracks on a cd from the wheel. Automatic climate control is included on the series II. 

The only thing I can't stand about my car is the seats. I hate the leather seats in Land Rovers. They make a much more comfortable cloth seat like the one in my father's 95 Discovery. Those are softer and less curved on top giving a much better ride when your driving the long haul.

I've had it in the shop twice since I bought it, both for very minor problems. I have not experienced any problems with Rover of America fixing it either. The Dallas dealer has been outstanding to both me and my father who also purchased from there.

Do yourself a favor and buy a Series II now. You won't regret it.
Who should buy this? Anyone who wants to off road but still needs the car to go grocery shopping in. Anyone who has fewer then one or possibly two children. Anyone who needs the extra room inside to haul something such as musical equipment - You can leave something like a drum set in the back while you run into 7-11 and not worry about it being stolen - The tinted rear windows block causal glances from seeing what's in the back and the car has an alarm.<br><br>
