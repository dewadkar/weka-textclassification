             I love my two month old 2001 Nissan Pathfinder LE.  In need of a four-door roomy vehicle with lots of trunk space, the Nissan Pathfinder turned out to be my perfect vehicle.  I needed something that would be used for hauling landscaping materials, patio furniture, and a new gas grill but also be comfortable to cart friends around in.
 I love the versatility! It's very roomy when the back seats are laid down for the purposes of bringing home newly purchased, large items. The roof racks were also useful for this purpose, as well as for adding a bike rack. It's also surprisingly &quot;small&quot; when it comes to parking - unlike many other SUVs.  The back seat is adjustable to give comfort to back seat passengers and the front seats also have lots of positioning options. It's a very comfortable car and has received nothing short of raves from all of my passengers.  I also love the in-dash 6 CD changer - so convenient, and the stereo system controls on the steering wheel contribute to the safety of an otherwise distracted driver.
 I hate the gas mileage - it's worse than my other vehicle which is a 1987 BMW.  The only other complaints I have are that I wish it had come with dual control a/c and vents for the back seats behind the console.
 This vehicle is very smooth to drive and comfortable on the roads. It drives like a car, rather than a truck. It's also very quiet. It's a little pricey - so no one should buy it if they can't afford the payments or the frequent trips to the gas station. Anyone looking for a comfortable, roomy vehicle will be happy with this one.<br><br>
