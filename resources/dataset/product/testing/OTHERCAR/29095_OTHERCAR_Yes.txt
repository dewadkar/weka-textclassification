            I love my Tacoma (extended cab, 4WD, automatic, 4 cylinder).  It may not be the truck for everybody, but it's perfect for me.  It has its slight problems, slightly cramped passenger compartment (more than slightly cramped in the back ... but, hey, how often am I back there?).  Also slight rumble noise in passenger compartment.  But, more importantly, it is responsive, the 4WD really makes it handle well on wet, snowy, icy roads, I sit comfortably high, and I just really enjoy driving it.  I've outfitted it to my own needs: cap, sleeping pad and homemade wooden storage bin in the bed ... I've made it into the ultimate sport truck for the working family man (wife and two sons) who enjoys the freedom of taking solo camping trips whenever possible.  My Tacoma actually made me happy about buying a truck with two characteristics that I never felt I'd accept.  I absolutely did not want to buy a 4 cylinder, but 2.7 liters is a big 4 cylinder for a truck the size of the Tacoma, so I'm quite happy with it.  As I said, the truck is very responsive, in terms of both steering and acceleration.  I never would have dreamed that one day I'd buy a PURPLE car or truck, and, in fact, only did so because I got a good deal on the features I wanted on this last remaining '99 on the dealer's lot.  I also never dreamed I'd be particularly enamored by the color of a vehicle.  But, Toyota's Midnight Purple is actually quite an incredible finish, almost a &quot;living thing&quot;, black most of the time, slight purple highlights under certain lighting, and truly purple (quite a beautiful shade of purple) only in direct sunlight.  Sorry to have focused on color and my own personal outfitting in this review.  But, having owned it only six months, I'm afraid I can't comment first-hand on long-term durability, reliability, and maintenance costs.  But, the reputation has me confident that these long-term features will also turn out well.  If you are looking for a fun-to-drive, fun-to-own, sport truck, check out the Toyota Tacoma.  <br><br>
