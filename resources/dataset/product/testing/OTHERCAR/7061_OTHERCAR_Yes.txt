            I bought the finepix 4700 after researching all over the web for a small multi-mega pixel digital camera. I wanted a camera that could also take short movies too. There are some cameras that take movies but do not have sound and I feel this is a major shortcoming. The Fuji finepix 4700 is just about the only camera that met &quot;all&quot; of my needs and at $799 (CompUSA) I think its the best value on the market.  You don't miss taking  short movies until you have done it and this is one of the best features of the camera.  The image quality on still pictures is superb!  You would have to spend over $1500 to get image quality that's better and the camera would not be as compact and portable I assure you.

This camera is light weight and easy to keep steady. The zoom is more than enough to most people and anymore zoom would require a tripod anyway and who carries one of those around all the time?  The screen is clear and the manual operation is enough for almost anyone.

The funny thing is how people react when they see this camera in action. They can't believe such quality comes in such a small package. The one minor gripe I have is shooting in low light situations like at a night club--which is something I do fairly often. There is a small green indicator light that is too near the viewfinder and under very very low light conditions the green light can make it difficult for you to see out of the viewfinder.  Using the screen to take pictures helps in this situation however but also drains the battery.  

This camera also eats alkaline batteries alive!  And Fuji does not recommend alkaline battery use --but says its ok to use them in an emergency. The camera comes with 4 nickel phosphate batteries and a slow charger that takes 12 hours to charge 2 batteries at a time. This should be enough for most peoples uses as the nickel phosphate batteries last for about 90-140 photos.  However you would make your life easier by going to radio shack and buying a quick charger and 4 additional rechargeable nickel phosphate batteries..The quick charger only takes 2.5 hours to fully charge up to eight batteries.

The software that came with the camera is awesome and easy to use. I think this is the perfect digital camera unless you can't spend over $500.  But if you can I would not buy anything else other than this.  You will love the movies this takes!  It is so fun and when you post them to the web or email them to friends everyone gets a big kick out it!
