            The 1998 Buick Regal GS, the car for the supercharged family, is a very smooth riding, get-up-and go kinda car.  With the 240 horsepower engine, it has no hesitation when you step on the gas...it really has some spunk. The wide tires and standard traction control make it very enjoyable to drive even in the wettest of weather, and in Hawaii, we have a lot of wet weather!  The only thing about the car that I feel could use some improvement is the front-wheel drive.  It has a tendency to pull some when you take off with some gusto...but recovery is minimal.  This is a car for families with children and without...both will enjoy the spaciousness and comfortable seats.  I have owned my Regal for nearly 2 years and plan on keeping it for a very long time.  GREAT CAR!!<br><br>
