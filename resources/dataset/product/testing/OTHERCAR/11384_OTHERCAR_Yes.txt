            If you want a great minivan, that this is the one to get. I've owned this vehicle for a few years and it is perfect. The turning is spectacular and the engine will never quit. I recommend this automobile for anyone young or old. This is the best buy I have ever made and anyone who gets this minivan will be a better person for it. This car will actually help you out will police run ins. If an officer sees you speeding in this car, he'll just think you're a family man or woman in a rush to pick up a young son or daughter from school. Every man and woman on this great Earth should have at least one if not two of these great automobiles. <br><br>
