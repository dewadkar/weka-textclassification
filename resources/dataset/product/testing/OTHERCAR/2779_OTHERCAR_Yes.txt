            I have now owned the Olympus D-400Z camera for over a year (15 months), and without a doubt, can say it's a wonderful camera.

Since I purchased this camera, they have come out with later models, such as the 450, 460, and I think now it's up to 490.  They all still use the same lens system to my knowledge, and Smart Media cards for photo storage.  The only difference is that the newer models now use rechargable batteries, and the 490 now also offers a &quot;Quicktime&quot; movie mode so you can take short movies.  The D-400Z does not offer a movie mode, but it's still a great camera.

The 3X optical zoom works well on the D-400Z.  The additional 2X digital zoom allows you to bring items in even closer.  The photos are always clear, and show great detail.  There is even a &quot;panoramic&quot; mode that allows you to take a series of photos side by side, and then with the included software allows you to &quot;stitch&quot; them together to make one long, panoramic shot.  I'll have to say as well, that taking a number of these panoramic shots, you cannot notice any lines where the photos are stitched together in most cases.  Great feature.  You can let the camera take automatically adjusted shots for you, or, you can control the brightness and more with manual settings.  I have compared the photos that my Olympus has taken to friend's more expensive digital cameras (A Sony Mavicas and a Fuji) and mine were by far better on screen, and in print.

This particular model came with a &quot;Camedia Floppy Disk Adapter&quot;, which allows you to insert your Smart Media card into it and use it through your floppy drive to download photos.  This is an added plus since the Olympus only includes a serial cable for other types of downloading - a slow process and battery drainer.  The floppy adapter can be purchased in stores as a separate item for use with any camera that uses Smart Media cards, by the way.

Regardless of which 400-series Olympus camera you're thinking about, they're well worth the money.  

ADDED 12/5/00 - SAMPLE PHOTOS:

I finally got off my butt and did it.  Follow the link below, and you'll go to my Yahoo photo page, where you'll find sample photos taken with the Olympus, and a couple of other cameras I've used.  I'll add more photos over time, but there's a few on there now.
