            This vehicle does all it was advertised to do and more. A recent snowstorm dumped a foot of snow, clogging the streets to a point of impassability. The Suburban, in the automatic 4wd mode, cruised around with nary a slip or slide. The abs system performed flawlessly.
On a recent 500 mile trip the &quot;Burban&quot; was smooth, quiet and stable. Averaged  15.5 mpg while cruising at 77 mph. The 44 gal. gas tank is a great feature on this truck.
The comfort and safety for my family were major reasons for purchasing a Suburban. It's ability to tow my bassboat was another.
This is my third Chevy Truck ('90 K2500, '95 K1500 Ext. Cab). I have logged well over 100,000 miles on each of them. In my opinion, Chevrolet does an excellent job in designing and building these trucks, and they should be commended.
If you have need for a hard-working, luxurious, passenger hauling, towing and all-around fine vehicle, the Suburban should be high on your list.
