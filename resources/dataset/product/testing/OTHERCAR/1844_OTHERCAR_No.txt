            Ok, ok... I admit it. I bought a Pontiac Grand Am. I'll claim temporary insanity later.

I originally went searching for a Honda. My 10 year old car was falling apart and I desperately needed a "new" one. Unfortunately, due to some credit problems, I soon found out my dreams of a GOOD car were just that - dreams. The banks were going to force me to buy a semi-late model, cheap car. So I couldn't even go for a good deal on an older Honda. Much to my dismay, the only car I could find that would fit into this category was a 97 Grand Am.

I had great doubts about this used car from the start. However, I must say most of my concerns haven't been an issue...yet.

The Good -

The handling is so-so - Not what I would hope for with a car with a V6, but acceptable. Braking is good, though not exceptional. I haven't had any repairs (yet.) However, I have all of the repair records from the previous owner and it had several, all minor (non-safety-involving) problems:  faulty electrical sensors for windshield wiper fluid, oil; bad stereo, etc.

The V6 does well overall, but is a little sluggish if starting from a full stop. With hard acceleration you can actually watch your fuel gauge go down. If you don't punch the gas you'll get decent gas mileage though. I get about 35 mpg on the highway.

It does have a fairly decent sound system.

The Traction Control System has worked well, helping to avoid some hydroplaning and stopping it if it starts.

The Bad -

The safety record for this car is abysmal, but I knew that before I bought it, so I pray when I get in...

I know of a couple of recalls for this car, and had one recently for a serious problem that I encountered personally. This latest recall involved the ignition: If for any reason the car failed to start and the key was held in the start position and it did not start "immediately", a high current would flow through the ignition and potentially cause a fire - either immediately or AT A LATER TIME - say, 2 weeks later in the middle of the night while your car was sitting in your garage as you slept peacefully... The week before I received this recall notice, my car wouldn't start when I was stalled in traffic (so of course I tried to start it several times, creating the specific problem the recall involved.) Fortunately, no fire. I called and made an appointment at my local Pontiac dealer to have the necessary relay switch installed. They took care of it in a reasonable amount of time, though the installation did take 2.5 hrs, not the 1 hr the notice claimed it would take.

The ride is pitiful. Bumpy on anything but the smoothest, most perfect road. Lots of engine and wind noise and squeeks.

The front seats are a bit cramped. You feel like the door is in your lap. The rear seat has no legroom. Also, the armrests on the doors have NO padding, so after your elbow rests on them for a few minutes it starts to REALLY hurt. Try this on a 2 day car trip - not pleasant. The cup holders are useless. They don't seem to fit any cup - soda cans are too small, but any cup with a wide enough bottom is so tall, and the holders so short, that the cup tips over if you make the slightest turn. Also, anything taller than a soda can has to be wedged between the dash and the automatic gear shifter if you're in park or neutral.

The trunk is decent sized, but the light in it is useless.

Overall, the car serves its purpose. It gets me from here to there. But I wouldn't recommend it. The reliability and safety concerns are too serious to overlook. I plan to get rid of it ASAP - hopefully before I have to deal with either of those problems.
