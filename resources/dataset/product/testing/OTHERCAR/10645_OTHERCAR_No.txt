            I had always wanted a Corvette since I was a little girl.  I finally got the chance in 1998 to lease one, which turned out to be a big mistake. I am returning it to the company as of 12/27/99.

At first it was great, like a dream come true.  The Corvette is a beautiful car and people always stop and comment on what a nice car it is.  Corvettes it great gas mileage.  I made it to Las Vegas from LA, CA in four hours and only used a quarter tank of gas.  The radio and other luxury features are great.  Best of all its fast!

No the problems with the Vette are as follows:  it's very sensitive and high maintenance, parts are expensive as is labor.  For example, an oil change costs about $80.00 and that is with a discount.  You can feel every rock, nook, and crany in any road as you drive.  The window in the back of the soft convertible top is prone to sun warping and scratches, which makes it impossible to see in the rear.  The blind spots are worse than normal.  There is absolutely no room in it!!  In the past year that I had mine, I encountered these other problems.  I had to replace the water pump($500), one of the universal joints($250), the velcro that holds the top down, and the console door($150).  

It is a nice car if you have the money and time to keep it maintained.  I would not recommend it for an everyday car.
