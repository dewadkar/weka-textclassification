            I did a lot of research before buying my first SUV. I wanted something without a big engine (the 2002 CR-V has a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine), something fuel efficient and something fun to drive. 

When I bought the car, a month ago, I thought that the CR-V would meet all of my requirements. I was wrong.

First off let me say that the car feels above and beyond what all the other mini-SUVs I tested felt like. And by that I mean that it drives more like a "car" (or sedan) than anything else in its class. (Even though I still think the Lexus RX300 is the best all-round SUV out there in terms of driving and handling like a car.) It has great acceleration, awesome handling (for an SUV that is 8.1 inches off the ground) and is REALLY fun to drive. Plus it is SUPER roomy and has loads of little compartments to put stuff in. Not to mention it looks REALLY good, especially in black (with the ultra-cool dark grey interior).

All that said, I am REALLY disappointed at the miles per gallon the car is getting. I am driving in half "city" conditions, half highway, and it's getting 16 miles per gallon tops. Would I have re-considered the car had I known that the sticker was lying? Maybe. Fuel economy was a major concern for me, as I drive about 12,000 miles a year minimum. By the way, the sticker says it gets 22 in the city and 26 on the highway. Don't think so. Maybe I am having SUV buyer's remorse. But I have never bought/had a car that was so way off in the fuel economy numbers. Either I am going through SUV shock (I used to drive the extremely economical Honda Accord) or they need to re-adjust those numbers. Either way, I cringe every time I fill up the tank and one 16-mile trip later the needle is away from "F."

Another factor that may be contributing to my pump shock is that the car's gas tank is way too small, I think, for a car that doesn't get good mpg. It should have at least a 19-gallon tank. And it has only a 15-gallon tank. Then again, most of the mini-SUVs have smallish tanks, which is dumb, I think. My Saab gets slightly better than 22 mpg and it has a 20-gallon tank.
 
If any other 2002 CR-V owners are experiencing the same thing, feel free to write me at cochitin@aol.com.
