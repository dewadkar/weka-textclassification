            O.k. I got my Honda Accord LX '98 after owning a Ford Aerostar minivan.  Need I say more!  I mean the Honda STARTS!  It's freezing cold outside, and this car is parked outside all night and yet...it STARTS on the 1st try every morning!  I have NEVER had a problem with this car, and I've had it for 2 years.

I take it in for regular maintenance/oil changes and that's it!  The best car by far I have ever owned and I would recommend it to anyone who needs reliability in a vehicle (and who doesn't).

The only complaints I could have are that it's a bit small for a family.  I have two boys, one with LONG legs and it does get cramped back there for him.  The other complaint is that the seats are not all that comfortable for long distance driving. You'll need to get out and walk around every couple of hours on a road trip.

That's it. I'm just so thrilled at how this car runs, and at how inexpensive it is to own!  I will truly plan on another Honda vehicle after this one, although perhaps a larger one :)<br><br>
