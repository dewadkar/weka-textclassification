            I had never owned a digital camera alone. I once had a VHS-C
video camera that had the capability to take digital photos but I never used that option and I got rid of the camera soon after I got it. Later, after getting into 3D modelling and animation, I realized how convenient it would be to have a digital camera around. I could use it to capture my own textures for use on my models. This was also around the same time that my son was born so it was dual purposed. I could also use the camera to take pictures of my son and send them to my friends and family. This camera has come in very handy.
The picture quality (which can be changed) at it's highest setting, produces some very good photos. Colors are very clear and there is little need for software dithering. The flash on the camera has 4 different settings which all have a good use. The camera has a small 1.5" view screen that you can use instead of the viewfinder if you wish, but it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. When you snap a pic, the screen turns on momentarilly so that you can get an instant review of the pic you just snapped. 
Output. The camera has two resolution modes; 640x480, and 1280x800. And there are three qualities of image, normal,
good, and best which are indicated by how many of the three stars are visible on the top display window. EASY TO USE.
My only complaint is the software. The camera hooks up to your PC via a USB cable connection. It may just be my PC setup, but I've had nothing but problems with the downloading of pictures from the camera to my PC. I have to install the driver, press CTRL+ALT+DEL so the system DOES NOT restart, then constantly turn the camera from trash to PC connect mode so that it doesn't auto-turn off while I reboot the system myself. Only then can I get access to the camera's memory. Kinda sucks, but it's worth because of the large picture capacity on the camera and because of the quality of images it produces.
