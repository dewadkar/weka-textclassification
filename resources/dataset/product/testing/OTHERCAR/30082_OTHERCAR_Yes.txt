            I looked at a lot of example photos, priced a lot of cameras, and played with a lot of digital cameras, but none of them matched the quality of the pictures the dc280 takes.

I use it for web images, and as a replacement for my old film point-and-shoot's.

I love the fact that it's USB and also that it uses the widely available Smart Media, which you can remove, replace, put in 3rd party Smart Media readers, etc.

It comes with rechargeable batteries, but in my experience, they're most useful if run out of disposable batteries, and need something to take a few quick pictures. Rechargeable batteries are notorious for being flaky and not lasting very long.

My only gripe is that I have not found a way to download the drivers/software from Kodak's website, and need to have the CD with me if I just want to connect my camera to another PC or at work and do not have the CD.

While the price is a little much, I have had the dc280 since late '99, experienced no problems, and have a lot of great pictures.
