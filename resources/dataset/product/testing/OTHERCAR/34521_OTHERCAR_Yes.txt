            I have owned a 97 Chevy Venture (extended) for a year and a half.  I have three children and I highly recommend this van for growing families.  Car seats fit safely in every seat in the van (except the front seats, of course) and there is plenty of room to walk around in and reach all of the kids.  

The seat belts are set in such a way that a child who is too old for a car seat can use the regular belt and it sits on his hips, rather than his tummy (which is very dangerous) and across his chest and shoulder, not his neck.  Each seat has a cup holder and &quot;nook&quot; for toys, etc. 

 The two rows of seats in the back are completely removable, which makes the van extremely versatile for trips and day-to-day activities.   The van is reliable and extremely comfortable to ride in.  There is more cargo space in the back (trunk area) than any other van we test drove and the rear seats are very comfortable.  

The roof of the van does not slant toward the back like many other mini-vans, so if you are tall, you can still sit in the back comfortably.  The only thing I would change on this van is the fact that it doesn't have a built in t.v. screen like the new &quot;Warner's Bros. Edition&quot; (it wasn't available on the 97 model). However, this van does have hook-ups for dc outlets in the front and back for games, portable t.v.'s, etc.  If you have children, this is the van for you.  I highly recommend it.<br><br>
