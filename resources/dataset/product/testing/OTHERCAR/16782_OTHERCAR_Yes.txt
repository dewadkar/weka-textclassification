            I bought my '90 Dodge Spirit brand new. It was the first car I ever owned that wasn't used. We spent weeks searching for a car because it would be my only transportation, a very important consideration when a lot of kids are involved. It needed to be economical to run, roomy enough for three kids, a dog and me. 
.
With School, Scouts, Dentists, Family vacations, etc., Reliability was a must. This car filled that whole wish list with room to spare. In addition to all these it is a nice looking car and very comfortable.

Routine maintenance is made easier by the design of the engine. The Fluid levels are easily checked by even the most inexperienced novice. Everything is right near the front of the engine so you don't have to lean  across the engine and risk ruining your clothes.

This car is a joy to drive with good responses and comfortable seating. An added bonus is the layout of the  cockpit area. Everything is easy to reach, and power windows  mean no reaching to get the windows up in rain.


Now, ten years and 250,000 miles later... I'm having some problems.. 
My car needs a new oil pan gasket, which under normal circumstances is a minor problem, but this is a front wheel drive car, and that means that you need to do some major work. <br><br>
