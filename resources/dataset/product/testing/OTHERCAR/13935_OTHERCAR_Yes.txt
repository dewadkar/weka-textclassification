            I live in Maine where we have no climate, just weather.  I am a consultant and cannot be trapped in my house or office when it snows or rains in bucket quantities.  Therefore, I need a car that can stand up to blizzards where the snow falls horizontally and rain that falls in sheets whipped by wind.  Maine is a big state and clients can be located far apart.

  So, I also need a car that is comfortable and has passenger car handling, particularly driver amenities that permit long periods behind the wheel.  Good visual range is particularly important - no car survives a car/moose collision.  I chose the Legacy Outback as a vehicle that could provide all of the above and the car has performed well. 

 The 4WD function allows travel on most kinds of roads in most conditions, including fairly heavy snow.  The lighting system aids in keeping a close eye on surroundings no matter what the condition, including fog.  Since I put heavy mileage on a car - 30,000 to 40,000 a year, the car must be affordable since it will be traded in every three years.  Maintenance must be easy and quick with minimal down time.  The Legacy fits the bill. 

 The car is not a true SUV but a pretender and should not be purchased by those who want off-road adventure.  I'd recommend it for those individuals who are best served by a hybrid vehicle.  One suggestion for improvement - buy and install a halogen light package for those really rotten nights where visibility is poor.  Also, this vehicle should not be purchased by those who don't really need four wheel drive - 4Wd uses more fuel.  <br><br>
