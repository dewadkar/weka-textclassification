            Recently, I was in the hunt for a commuter car, Well that's what I told my wife. &quot; I want to limit the mileage on my lease&quot;, her response the usual huh, huh. So I set forth on my trek, i searched dealers and newspapers. believe it or not i found my little baby on an on-line auction. It called too me.A 1990 red miata convertible with 63,000 miles for a mere $ 4500. 

I went to look at it and fell in love. I love it 's simplicity of style.I find it to be a similar experience to riding my motorcycle. I have only one suggestion, it would be nice to have 5&quot; more of legroom. not that it's a bad thing but at 6'2&quot; and 235lbs, i am probably at the limit for this vehicle.

Driving this car is like racing matchbox cars as a kid. it is very responsive and peppy with precision steering. A vehicle of freedom.

I think everyone should own this car. there have been many iterations of the 2 seat roadster, but I must say Mazda perfected it.<br><br>
