                All right I would like to start off buy saying that I have been looking for a halfway descent, affordable digital camera for awhile now.  Most Digital cameras run anywhere from $300 up to $1200. So I was a little skeptical about buying this one for under $200.

    Well the package arrived in the mail, and I opened it up and began to unpack the camera. At first glance if nothing else I can say at least the camera looks impressive, with its metallic blue and gray coloring, complete with 1.8 inch LCD viewing screen.

    So I decided to give it a test, lets not even look at the instruction book lets see how easy this thing is to operate with out any prior knowledge. I am pleased to say that I put in the batteries, inserted the 2mb smart media enclosed and opened up the view finder. At this point the power came on , so I looked through the view finder and hit the button on the top right corner by itself, as it seemed logical to be the one to take the picture with. The flash went off and the picture I snapped showed up on the LCD. So this camera appears to be good for beginner's as it is easy to use.

    Now after playing around for a few days I can tell you that the camera's 2mb card holds anywhere from 12 - 96 pictures depending on the resolution you use to take them in. The Battery life when using the LCD screen is rather short though, so I recommend also buying rechargeable batteries and a charger, as it take 4 AA batteries to operate it.

    The AGFA Photo wise software that comes bundled with the camera is relatively easy to use, but has limited features. The download time between the camera and the PC are relatively short, although they would be faster with a smart media Image Mate USB. the 2mb card is sufficient for now but you will obviously as you start to have fun with the camera want to increase it. The image quality is respectable, not perfect but useable. 

    I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a decent first time digital camera, the price is defiantly right. There are four different resolutions you can use while taking pictures, different flash modes, red eye reduction, you can scan through the images you have taken on the LCD screen and delete those you don't like, the camera has a self timer mode( so you can get into the picture to if you want), and it also has three different distance setting which helps to make for better pictures depending on how far away you are. The user manual can be found on the AGFA web site at www.agfahome.com , otherwise it is software based on the photo wise installation disk.

    All in all a think this is a decent camera , and that you get the most bang for your buck. Originally it will be more than adequate , but as time goes on you will need to buy a few accessories for it ex. more memory and rechargeable batteries. The camera is good for beginner's and will allow you to take instant photos, download them to your computer, and either print them out or send them to your friends and family. I feel the camera is a good inexpensive way to get yourself into the digital photography phenomenon.<br><br>
