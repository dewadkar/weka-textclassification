            It should be a requirement of United States citizenship that every person own a Corvette.  This classic automobile has been defining the American sports car since the early 50's and in its most recent form, defines what the American sports car should be for the next millenium.  
On a &quot;bang for buck&quot; scale, there is no car in the world that can hold a candle (or even a raging brush fire) to the Corvette.  It's faster than your baby brother's urinary track, louder than your dad's stomach after a night of Mexican bean food, and sticks to the road like your grandfather's polygrip denture fixing.  What can I say, it's a family car.  What are the downsides?  Well, your family can't ride with you, vacations are out in this car, and those damn motorcycle cops are on your tail again.  
Basically, given the means, there is no reason NOT to buy this car.  It can be had for well less than 40 large, comes in three different body styles (please pick the convertible, it is so dang pretty!), and for people who don't think 350 horsepower is enough at the red lights, it has a more powerful brother dubbed the Z06.  
Do yourself a favor, go to your closest Corvette dealer, hop in, and take one for a test drive.  Then get out, go change your pants, and come back with your checkbook.  You owe it to yourself!<br><br>
