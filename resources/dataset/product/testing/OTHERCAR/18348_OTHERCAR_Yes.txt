            This underrated gem is hard to find, as it is now almost 20 years old.  But almost no one hears of it unless you have watched many japanese racing and drifting videos, or watched Initial D.  Even so, most will not be able to actually drive it.

So what's so great about this Corolla?  Well, first of all, it's RWD platform, 1.6 litre engine, and a very lightweight chassis - a very fun combination indeed.  It pushes around 140 hp, and was considered a lot of power back in the day.  It definately does not require much power at all, since it is light, and balanced very well.

It is also hard to find one in great condition for obvious reasons.  Only few will recognize it as a sports car, and it is those who will try their hardest to find one intact, fixed up, reconditioned, or a hardcore fan that has owned one when new (and had the luxury of keeping it well kept).

Whatever the case, I met someone who actually owned one of these gems, complete with orginal tires and wheels.  Of course, what was installed on the car was not stock at all.  He kept all the original parts "just in case", but still lightly modify it to his liking.  Not much was revealed, except for the fact that he kept the engine completely N/A.

Whatever he did to it, it sure does not sound like a car you have bought from the dealership - definately modified, as the exhaust rumbles sweetly.  The color strikes "old" in the mind, but is actually a very nice dark gray that's shiney (clear coated).  He admits that it's been thru two paint jobs, but it's been the same factory color when it was new.  I can only describe it as "Granite" from the Nissan color scheme available today.

Once buckled down (seats are from Recaro, not stock), it feels tight and rock solid.  I couldn't even reach in my pockets for anything!  Turning to the owner in the passenger seat, he gave a nod to go.

First lap around the track was slow and steady.  The car felt just like any other econo cars I've driven in my day.  Except, of course, for the exhaust note and the engine roaring (definately NOT stock).  He assured me it was quiet as a rabbit when new (and was boring).  The ride comfort was great, as it was smooth and did not gave way to much body roll.  Riding across bumps, the car was very composed and seemed eagear to keep going without being skitterish.  I can see he was going for a balanced between race car and street car.  For now, he got the street car comfort right.

Lap 2 comes around, and I punched it.  The engine seems to pull outside of 4,500 RPMs to it's 7,200 RPM redline in the lower gears, but definately want's to be revved higher in the higher gears.  The fun runs out in 5th gear, but still pulls hard in 4th no matter where the needle is (above 5,000 RPMs).

Enough with the pulls, lets get cornering!  I can't believe how balanced this thing is!  On the first corner, I exepcted some front end push, but there was none.  Because of this, I actually spun the car around.  Doh!  Upon a couple tries, I was able to get a feel for the rear end and a little more of that "weight transfer" logic that most instructors will lecture you to death about.  The chassis is very sensitive to every little input you give it - throttle, braking, steering.  It's a hoot to drive, because it is such a challenge!  But after lap 6, I was pushing it pretty hard without having to correct myself too much in the corners (from recovering from the rear end sliding out).  Over all, a blast to drive, and is surprisingly 
boring to watch when driven correctly.

Steering feels very connected, but not really "tight".  In fact, it still feels a bit loose.  This strange new feel for me was only a problem during moderate speeds (30 mph) during street and parking-lot manuvers.  However, on the track, the smooth pavement was felt immediately, and the steering was less uninviting, and more comfortable.  Must have been the power steering (or lack of?).  Whatever the case, when you're up to speed, it feels much more natural, and you can feel almost every crack on the road!  Hitting a couple corner edges (where there were little red and white bumps), I could feel every bump transmitted.  This was true even when I just grazed it!  You can feel the front tires actually begining to slip at times when you go into a corner way too fast, and braking can be felt as well.  Locking up the tires is not much of a problem, as you will know.  Now THAT was a freaky experience!

But lets get out of helmets and check out the civil ammenities the 80s gave:  velvet blue interior, AM/FM cassette with 4 speakers, and an interior style that screams for a make over from the "Queer Guys".  The radio is still stock, as for the speakers.  "I still use a seperate MP3/CD player to play music over the stock 4 speakers" says the owner.  When asked why not change it for something better (hey, you DO have to live with the car), he says "it's still great to show off to people like you.  Besides, I have another car I drive as a daily driver.  Actually, this car is fast becoming a musuem piece".

Whatever his reason, his car seems mostly stock except for performance.  Even then he says he can always change it back to stock.  "It's definately not pushed to it's limit, parts and performance-wise".

Indeed.  Even so, the Corolla GTS is already a hot little bugger on it's own.

So with a long parting good-bye (to the car and the owner), I feel privilleged an experience like this with the good old GTS (also known as the Trueno in Japan).  What a way to start a new year. :)  Now, I will always be searching the net for a well-kept AE86 (AE86 is the chassis code for this car) for sale - cars.com, eBay, and even on the streets of Chicago.  Thank you, AE86 owner, for giving me an obsession...
