            After testing the Ford Focus, Plymouth Neon, Volkswagen Jetta, and countless other similar vehicles, I have to say that my brand-new silver Cavalier is the single best thing that I've ever bought. Why? It's cheap (in price, not quality), looks good, and runs quick.
My very first car was an '83 Camaro Berlinetta edition. Don't ask. It looked horrible, but the interior was just so... cockpit-like. And it handled like a dream. Much the same as my new Cavalier. 
The front seats have these neato supports right around where your kidneys are, effectively gluing you in the seat and eliminating your passenger's needing to reach for the nonexistant oh-shit bar above the window. They look strange, but they really work. My 2-door version's rear seats also have gotten some surprising remarks from friends. More often than not, they have said that they 'wouldn't mind a road trip if they got to sit in the back'. Another thing that you'll have to experience to believe.
The back seat can also be folded down flat FROM INSIDE THE VEHICLE to allow for storage of large trunk items. Or to show off the subwoofer in the trunk, as I have chosen to do.
About the only problem I have with the car is that when I roll down the window after a good rain, water tends to drip into the car instead of rolling down a gutter or something. I've already bought a pair to rain gutter-window visor thingies to fix this. Plus they look pretty nice too.
Simply put, the car is a solid piece of machinery that is more than worth the price. <br><br>
