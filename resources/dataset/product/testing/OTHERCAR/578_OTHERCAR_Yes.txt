            In early 1980, I needed a new car because my new job meant three hour car trips at least twice a week, halfway across Ohio. I had an uncle who sold Oldsmobiles, so I went to see him. He talked me into a big 1979 Olds 98 Regency, a factory official's car, with about 6,000 miles on it. It was big heavy and beautiful, by 1980 standards. It had leather seats crafted like pillows, on top of the seats. It had a sunroof, a vinyl roof and all the options known to General Motors at the time.

I drove it relentlessly for 7 years, with only two service problems, of any kind. Once the cruise control stopped working, and once, one spark plug wire went bad, and needed to be replaced. Otherwise, I did nothing but regular maintenance, oil changes and new brake pads, and such, for over 125,000 miles. 

Unfortunately, I got spooked by a colleague, who told me he also had an Oldsmobile, which started falling apart at 130,000 miles. So I panicked, sold the Olds, and have never had such a trouble free car since. I have a feeling, that someone today is still driving my Olds, with few problems.

And by the way, what a safe car. I once was hit at an intersection by a car that must have been going about 50, hit my rear end, sending me spinning. He kept on going, but when my cqar stopped turning around, I was fine, and the Olds had a crushed rear fender. It was fixed and didn't seem to suffer for it.<br><br>
