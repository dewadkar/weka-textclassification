            I recently bought a 2000 dakota sport, club cab and 4x4.  So far its a great truck and I love just about every thing about it.  My last truck was a 1993 ranger club cab and 4x4 as well.  When looking for a new truck I was deciding between the ranger and dakota and the dakota came out on top.
First of all, the truck is in a class all by itself - its so much physically bigger than any other compact on the road and is priced with $1000 of the ranger - comparably equipped.  Right off the bat I was impressed by the dimensions - the bed, the cab and especially the stance made it hard to believe that it was a compact pickup.
I opted for the sport package and had originally specked out a v8 and 5 speed.  However, this powertrain was not available and I settled on a v6 with an automatic.  Of course, this was only after test driving it - the six has plenty of punch and plenty of towing for what I need - which is either a pair of jet skiis or sleds.  The truck handles great, although the bigger tires and wheels (31x10.5) make it a little squirrely in the snow.  The 4x4 system is a lot more solid than the rangers - it uses an axle lock compared to ford's transfer case and locking hubs.
The overall level of fit and finish is very high and you can tell the truck is well made.  It rides solid and looks really sharp.  I got it with the mopar bedliner, rear slider and sport package all for 400 under dealer cost - not bad at all.
So far the only gripe I've got is about the fuel econonomy.  With 1000 miles on it, I'm getting only 12-13mpg, compared with the 14-18 the manual says.  The dealer tells me that this will improve after the first oil change - I'll believe it when I see it.  
Overall, its a great truck - I'm very pleased with the deal I got and the performance of it.  I think in a few months I'm going to be wishing i got the v8, but so far so goo.<br><br>
