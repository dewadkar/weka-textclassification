            To be honest, when I first sat in this car I was rather nervous. The car wasn't mine and so if I were to hurt it,....well...I don't have much money so I hardly would have been able to pay for it. As I selected 'drive' I remembered that the owner had told us to &quot;take the car as far as you think you can handle it&quot; well, I wasn't sure I wanted to do that but then I thought hey, how often am I going to be able to drive one of these? (the answer is - probably never again).
As I cruised along, you could barely hear the engine, then, when I floored it, the front of the car seemed to lift off the ground, there was a loud roar of the engine and the scream of the tires as the torque flowed from the engine. Thank goodness for seatbelts. One of the features that I enjoyed playing with was the traction control button. If it was on, all you really had to worry about when flying around a corner is the steering. The traction control actually delivers the right amount of braking to the right wheel and it also controls the gas. It does all of this just so you won't end up going into the ditch. I had the most fun with the car when this button was off. 
The interior was rather nice. The seats were comfortable, the radio buttons within easy reach, and the sound system was impressive for a convertible. The convertible top was the simplest I have ever seen. Undo two latches, lift up the body panel it hides under, fold the top back, latch the cover over it. That is all there is to it.
Over all, this car is a very impressive performer, but, when you see the price tag, you would almost expect it to be.
