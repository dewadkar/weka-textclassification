            If you are looking for a first or a second car that is not too expensive, is unique, and fun to drive, I definitely recommend the Audi TT coupe/convertible. This 2-door coupe is more than I expected. This remarkable sport car starts at about 30,000 and trust me it is worth it. The convertible is more, but still worth it. The experience of driving them is fun and unforgettable.

The 4-cylinder engine produces a strong 180 horsepower to the four wheels(only with Quattro), with an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in just over 7 seconds(that's a real sport car). The engine produces 173 foot-pounds of torque, and has a turbocharger. The car handles just like a real sport car(hey what do you know it is a sports car), plus the styling of the 2-door TT is a head turner from any direction.

Inside the car, the TT has leather bucket sport seats and polished stainless steel ornaments around the air vents, the gear shift, and the gas cap. Overall the interior is wonderful, every thing is in the right place and fits together perfectly. The back is not that roomy, it fits a child no older than 5. My only complaint is that the tires are a little to large.

Maintenance is not that expensive, and doesn't  take much time. If you plan to do it yourself, you should have access to a garage. I forgot to mention the TT  gets about 25 miles a gallon which is good around town. The TT is so sleek you need a spoiler to keep it from lifting off the ground around curves. The TT is(T)otally (C)ool. Over all it is (T)otally (T)errific
