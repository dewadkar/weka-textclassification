            This car did me good for a while.  Strong engine I had no problems with.  Great gas mileage for the size of the engine (I had the V6, 3.3 liter).  I got the car at an auction a couple years ago (2001) and it only had 45,000 miles on it, then the transmission gave out on me shortly after that.  After a year of fixing this (Rack and pinion, axle, ignition switch, brakes) it was good.  I put a lot of work into it, but I don't know if that was because of getting it from an auction or because of the car itself.

The turning in the car was HORRIBLE.  I used to drive a big ol' Ford Station wagon that could turn better than this car.  It just doesn't turn sharply, everything becomes three point turns.

The trunk was huge!  I travel across country to school and home and I was able to get nearly everything I needed into that car (and I've got a lot of junk).

The heating coil broke as well, I think this was the car.  And it was very expensive to replace.  Everyone quoted me over $600 to replace it being that it was behind the dash board and it'd be a lot of work to get to it.  I couldn't justify spending half the car's worth to fix the heater.

Nothing else comes to mind.  Hope this helps
