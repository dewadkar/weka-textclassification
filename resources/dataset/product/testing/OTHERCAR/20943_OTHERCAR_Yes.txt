            It's called retro-rage and if you are in the market for a new vehicle, can wait a few months and love the way cars looked in years past then Detroit is about to deliver to you.
It began several years ago when Plymouth introduced the Prowler.  What a beautiful car.  Unfortunately for everyone other than Bill Gates and any average pro athlete, no one could afford this car.  Then VW brought back the cherished &quot;Bug&quot;.  Even though we had to get on waiting lists to purchase one, the car itself is beautiful and not to expensive.  But wait there's more.....
Sometime this spring Chrysler will ship the new PT Cruiser.  This is a retro-rage vehicle at its best, beautiful, curves galore and equipped with a not-to-pricey sticker.  Since Chrysler can tell you more about it than I, check out this sight;  www.ptcruiser.com.
Dodge will follow this great little vehicle with a new retro-truck, although I do not know the delivery time. This truck is best described  ala WWII, tall, rugged looking, and oh by the way tough...in a &quot;that is a tough looking truck&quot; way.
Finally is the &quot;new&quot; Ford T-bird.  Wanna talk retro?  If you always wanted that '56-57 model T-bird but couldn't find nor afford one, then check out the Ford showrooms soon.  I don't know much about it but it looks awesome.
It's about time the engineers at the Big Three finally noticed that people still like the old styles, there are plenty of 'old' hot-rods out there that car buffs just love.  &quot;If you build them, we will buy them.&quot;  Who knows, maybe drive-ins, both the movie and restaurant types, will return in Retro-Rage 2000.<br><br>
