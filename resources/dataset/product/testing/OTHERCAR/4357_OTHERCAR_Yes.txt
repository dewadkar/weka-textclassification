            I think Ford is shooting itself in the foot with this one:  I recently got a letter from Ford saying it's discontinuing the Mercury Mystique effective in 2000.  That's too bad, because my Mystique, a 1998 model, has pep, a sporty feel, lots of room (including a spacious trunk that includes the back seat if you fold the rear seat down) and a reasonable price.

Ford also has reasonable financing, and a Web site where you can track your account.  I don't think they're offering 0.9% financing any longer, but at my local dealer selection of Mystiques has mushroomed, and since it's December, I'll bet they're willing to deal.

Generally, I like this car better than any I've had.  There are many short on-ramps where I live and this car's V-6 will get you up to speed in a hurry, without being too unreasonable about eating gas; however, there are some things that worry me.  I was driving onto a left hand exit off the interstate: it was night and there were no floodlights, just a concrete wall to my left.  Suddenly, in the lane, a car ahead, stalled, no lights.  I swerved to the right (terrifying the driver behind me!) and braked...and almost lost control of the car because of the wobble, fish-tailing back and forth until I was able to slow to about 25 MPH or so.  The car was almost new, so I took it in for inspection under warranty and adjustments were made, and I haven't had the problem since.  However, I haven't been in that situation since, either. 

There have been at least two recalls involving the car, but the other service has just been regular maintenance. <br><br>
