            I was in the market for a new car around July of '98.  I love cars and I am very critical, so deciding which car to buy was not going to be an easy one.  The only limits a four door sedan for under $20,000.  I looked at all four door sedans by Toyota, Dodge, Subaru, and Volkswagen.  Between these manufacturers, I narrowed down the selection to the Subaru Impreza wagon/outback.  The dealer was willing to sell it for a little above $17,000, well within my price range and it offered features like 4 wheel drive, automatic, and sportier looks, that which the other manufacturers lacked (comparison between the jetta, corolla, and stratus).  

I reluctantly made a stop at the Nissan dealer to see what they offered. I purchased a sentra in '93 and I was very unhappy with the buying experience and swore that I would not buy another Nissan product.  I am happy I did.  Nissan had huge cashback incentives and the dealer was eager to reduce the purchase price to $100 above invoice.  The Altima sticker $19,500 was reduced by $2000 by the dealer and by a $2000 incentive, down to $15,500. At this price, it was a no brainer.  

The Altima comes fully loaded with near luxury appointments and has the most powerful engine of the bunch.  It handles well and is extremely quite on the open road.  The car came with a few defects. The most notable of which is a noise in the rear when going over large bumps, which the dealer could not repair, and imbalanced tires. Otherwise, it was perfect.

The car has been very reliable over the past 2 years. It went in for repair for the rear noise, and there was a coolant leak from the radiator hoses. The gas mileage, however, never came close to what the sticker promised - approximately 20 mpg in mixed driving.  A further annoyance, which is typical of most cars today is that the masonite panel covering the spare tire warped forming a depression in the center of the trunk, making all my packages roll toward the center.
