            One day in September, we noticed the family Volvo needed a new water pump and a hose for the automatic transmission system needed to be replaced. So  after taking it to the best Volvo mechanic on Long Island, somewhere in Glen Cove, we called Enterprise to rent a car. We wanted anything small. Dodge Neon, Saturn anything, a Ford, or a Dodge, but apparently Enterprise has phased out all economy cars because &quot;they are unpopular&quot;. The smallest thing they could give us was the 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara.

Now, I had never driven an SUV before. I've driven six wheel truck, which was something of a nightmare for me, and this piece of imported garbage was similar. I'll admit, it's very difficult for me to write this review without resorting to numerous profanities. When I want to describe this &quot;vehicle&quot;, the word &quot;s**tbox&quot; is the first thing that comes to mind. When I drive this car, and my friends and acquaintances look at me driving it, I feel truly foolish, and find it difficult to suppress the urge to shout at them &quot;This is not my car, it was a rental! It was all they had left!&quot; I can't tell you <b>exactly</b> how I feel when I drive the Suzuki, but it rhymes with &quot;a gashole&quot;.

The car we rented was dark green on top, with all this silvery white stuff on the bottom (i.e., the bumper area and the trim around the tire area). Why can't they resort to only one color scheme? Inside, I noticed there are numerous buttons. I pressed the mysterious button marked &quot;cruise control&quot; to see what happens. Nothing, apparently. The Ford Contour I rented the month before has them beat on that score. There are also at least 3 buttons inside that do absolutely nothing when you press them. They aren't even marked.

The only good thing about the cheesy as hell interior is that it is made of cloth, and they didn't slaughter any animals to make an equally ugly and cheesy leather exterior. I tried to put my dogs in this thing to take them for a walk at a nearby park, but I discovered that this Sports Utility Vehicle, of all things, has the roominess and cargo space of a two door compact sports car. Even my old Volvo station wagon can put my dogs in a more comfortable situation, plus I have more cargo space, to boot.

Sports Utility Vehicles have the reputation of being all-terrain vehicles with a great deal of constitution and endurance. In the case of the 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara, however, I felt as if jumping the curb would put me in the nearest trauma unit hospital. This &quot;vehicle&quot; has the traction of a go-kart, to put it mildly. My Volvo can scale hills much better than this sorry piece of tin. Just driving on the roundabout exit ramps of an expressway makes me feel as if I'm about to tip over, and that I should brace for impact.

Bottom line? If I were in an &quot;American Graffiti&quot; situation which warranted a wild, 1950's style drag race of some kind, I'd choose my old 1986 Volvo with 240,000 miles on it over the 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara with only 200 miles on it. If I had to drive in heavy terrain, relying on the whims of mother nature, I'd choose my Volvo over the Suzuki. If I was meeting with a pretty girl, I'd pick her up in my old Volvo, not the new Suzuki.

Perhaps this comparison is not at all fair, but unfortunately I could not find a 1976 Volvo Station Wagon to give the 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara the proper handicap advantage.

To add insult to injury, one of my Hare Krishna friends who doesn't at all keep up with current events and the latest trends saw me driving this thing and said to me, &quot;Why didn't you just ask them to get you a Range Rover, or a Pathfinder?&quot; This is coming from a guy who couldn't even tell me what CNN was when I mentioned it in a conversation 2 weeks ago.

I think Suzuki should just save themselves the embarassment of costly litigation -- when a bunch of parents see this car as &quot;The Geo Tracker of the 21st century&quot; and buy it for their kids, only to hear that they tipped over days later -- and just recall this garbage. It's really that pathetic.<br><br>
