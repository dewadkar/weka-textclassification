            I've owned 3 GM cars so far, I must say that this car has been the most dependable.  In the 4 years I've had it, very little has gone wrong with it.  I hear a lot of jokes about this car, because its not an expensive car, its not a classy car either, but its been very dependable.  Many people tell me that its a car that will never be stolen, no one wants to steal a Cavalier.  Now to me, that's a good thing. Overall its been a good little car and I like it.  I wish GM would have stayed with this body style, it looks a lot better than the new Cavalier does.  Its a nice car that handles well and its good for a first car or even a third, fourth, fifth car<br><br>
