            In 1996 I wanted a car that was sporty yet practical.  I HATE to car shop so I told my Husband what I wanted in a car and this is what was in the driveway when I got home from work.  The Sebring was a new car then and not many had heard of it but everyone that saw it LOVED the look of this car.  It is a great family type car with enough room in the back seat to ride a long distance and be conformable.  Almost to comfortable really, try a 700 mile trip with your Mother in Law, hoping that she will not want to do that ride again anytime soon, but due to the confront of the ride she is willing to visit anytime. 
The Sebring rides low to the ground and has a very high outside noise level so ensure that you have a booster on your radio to ensure that you can hear the radio.  The Sebring does ride okay but not as good as other cars but in the snow, this is a great car.  I have a 70 mile commute to work and back and even in the snow the car got me where I needed to be.
I would own another Sebring when the price is right, next time it will be a convertible though.  With this winter so far that could be a year around car.<br><br>
