               I think Nissan Maximas are great.We recently purchased one , and we have been really satisfied so far.Since we have two children, we wanted something that was roomy yet still hip. You also have to consider that we have to get two car seats into the backseat, so we wanted something that had alot of room in the back.The Maxima has this.When we are all in the car, I feel that I have enough room to move around plus the kids are not on top of each other.

        The radio is great too.The sound is clear,and it always picks up well.I also love the way this car rides.We feel that since it is bigger we feel a little bit safer on the roads.
        The only thing that I do not like about this car is the driver window.It has a tendency to stick sometimes and makes a slight noise when you are driving.We have had it fixed, but it has started doing it again.
       By far the Maxima is the best car we have ever had.It looks good ,and has enough room for a family of four.<br><br>
