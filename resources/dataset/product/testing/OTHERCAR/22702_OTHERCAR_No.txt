                 My parents bought me a 1995 Plymouth Neon (used) for my
16th birthday, two years ago.  The seats were comfortable, it was very roomy, and it had a great appearance.  Only problems I did realize it handled rough and it was fair reliability.  So at first I thought I was hot stuff, and the first couple of months I felt like it, but when roads started to get slightly slippery, my Neon did not come through.  Now I'll be honest I'm not the best driver, especially in winter.  So I drive slow
and pump my brakes when needed.  Later during the middle of winter when roads just seemed to be dry from the salt I had a wreck.  I slid into a the other lane, not ten feet from a stop sign, hitting one of my friends mother, driving a van.  I wrecked the whole front end of my Neon and broke her headlight.  I was not going but 15-20mph on road that did not look all that bad.  I was happy that I did not cause much damage, but I was also was mad that my Neon did not hold up as well as I thought it might.  Later I found Neons made around the time mine was built had terribly low crash test results.  It was my fault for the crash, but I think the Neon could have protected me a little more.  Luckily I walked
away with only a burnt and jammed thumb.  I was never very fond of the control that I had over the car either.  My grandparents complain about the control in their 98� Neon to this day.  I definitely would not recommend a used Neon.
	Though I have herd some good things critics have said about the new ones.  I�m not the person to find out if the critics are right.<br><br>
