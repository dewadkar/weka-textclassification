            After extensive research, the Nikon Coolpix 995 was the clear choice for my first digital camera.  Here are the reasons why:

Cost
Nikon recently reduced the price to $599.  You're getting a digicam capable of capturing at 3.34 megapixels.  There are few, if any, camera manufacturers who can match this pricing in this "prosumer" category.

Ease of use
I began experimenting with this camera by shooting everything in "Auto" mode and was surprised at how accurately this camera measured focal length, shutter speed, white balance, etc.  For those who want point-and-click capabilities, the 995 will do all the work for you.

Manual Control
For those of us who want more than a point-and-click experience and like to fiddle around with various camera settings, this digicam is simply awesome.  You have the ability to control virtually ALL aspects of picture taking.  For a beginner like myself, this involves learning about how images can be manipulated, what the best settings are for unique situations, etc.  But that's what makes this camera so rewarding; it provides you the opportunity to put your unique visual style and ideas to work.  With it's plethora of controls and menus, the 995 can be a bit overwhelming at first but can be easily mastered with a little patience.

Picture Quality
Beautiful color rendering and superb detailing in macro mode puts the 995 in its' own class.  The macro mode is able to capture from 2 MILLIMETERS from the subject.  For those with blooming gardens, you will be able to capture the dew resting on flower petals with amazing detail and accuracy.  For portrait shots, skin tones are replicated with amazing accuracy.  Colors are vibrant and true to tone.  In manual mode, you can oversaturate colors or reduce it down to black and white.  The B&W photos I've shot have been beautiful and evocative.  It wouldn't surprise me that Ansel Adams-type landscapes could be possible under ideal conditions and camera settings.  Simply superb images for a camera at this price level.

Easy to use software
Some have critiqued that they had problems with the software that Nikon provided but I had no problem on my XP PC.  If you have XP, simply run the USB from the camera to the PC and XP automatically launches a wizard from which to view and store your images.  I did have a problem using the software on my dad's Win95 desktop, but quickly rectified this after seeing a tip on the incredible dpreview.com site (highly recommended for digicam enthusiasts).

Cons
Very few to report.  However, the camera's body case does have a cheap, plastic look to it.  It is not esthetically pleasing and doesn't have the appearance of a pro camera.  Freezing action shots is also somewhat difficult (but possible with some image degradation), however there are few consumer digicams that can accurately capture fast action.  A 16MB card (a little better than the typical 8MB) is included but you need much more memory you want to get the highest-quality pictures. I wish manufacturers would include at LEAST a 64MB card. For the serious enthusiast, a 1 Gig Microdrive is a must but a bit out of my price range for now.  The battery life seemed low, but I'm getting about four hours (which I'm hearing is good); just buy an extra set of batteries and you'll be ok.

4-22-02 UPDATE
I continue to use this camera quite often for a wide variety of uses and enjoy picture-taking immensely.  I'm still learning how to utilize its' array of features in addition to my self-education on photographic composition.  For a hint of what the Coolpix 995 can do in the hands of a green amateur photographer, check out some of my Safeco Field and Spring Flower photos at:  http://community.webshots.com/user/cornelius_plum

Note: the posted pictures were average-sized photos to speed up internet download time and to manage card space (still using a 16MB card), so imagine these pictures at the 995's full capability.  I've shot and printed images at the full "super fine" level and they are wonderfully detailed.  But for now, enjoy the pictures I've posted so far.  I'm always open to suggestions and photography tips, so leave a message on the board!
