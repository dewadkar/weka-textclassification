            Minivans lack style and SUVs in the same price range as the Eurovan are just cars on steroids -- offering no more room than a sedan. I'm suggesting the Eurovan may be the perfect family vehicle. We've had ours for almost a year and would never go back.

My wife likes it because on road trips she can stand up and walk (not climb or crawl or reach) to the back seats and sit back there if she needs to.

Typical minivans feel like longer sedans with a back row instead of a trunk. The Eurovan feels more like a smaller van -- it is taller and offers much more leg room. It also sits higher above the road which is good for taking this camping (even though it's not technically an off-road vehicle it does very well).

While it's taller, it isn't longer than a standard minivan. The wheel base (axle to axle) is  equal to most minivans. That, coupled with its rack and pinion steering, make the Eurovan easy to turn and even parallel park. (I made my wife test and approved this before we made the purchase. It passed handily.)

The A/C works very well.

A word on spaciousness:
Removing the seats makes this thing great for hauling stuff. In a single trip I once hauled two benches, two side-chairs, three full-sized swivel office chairs and two filing cabinets (the two-drawer, double-wide ones); all without putting anything on top!

Even with the seats in, the back compartment rivals my brother's <i>Expedition</i>.

This vehicle is equipped with 7 full sized passenger seats. Unlike typical minivans which have a low back seat minus the headrests.
