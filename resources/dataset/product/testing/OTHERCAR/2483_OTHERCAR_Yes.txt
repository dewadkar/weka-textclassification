            I own a 1995 Hyundai Sonata 4 speed.  I brought this vehicle because of it get up and go and for the room it has inside for my family to be seated comfortably.  I love my car because it very good on gas mileage.  I get about 33 miles to the gallon on the hwy and 29 miles to the gallon on the city streets.  I only had one problem with my car and that was the transmission.  It would make this noise every time I went up my driveway.  I had to go the service center a few time before the finally realize what the problem was.  That was the only thing that really bothered me. After they found the problem Hyundai sent a flat bed truck to my house to pick up my car to take it out of town to fix it.  It was going for about 1 week.  The company offered me a rental for that week that it was getting fix and they paid for it in full.  Everyone was very nice and helpful.  My care received a Transmission over hall and every since It's been fixed I have not had any problems with my car.  Now, when I purchased my car it was brand new with only 9 miles on it. My car give me a smooth ride,the seating is very comfortable and there is plenty of leg room for everyone that is riding.  With 2 small children, using a double stroller and a play pin where ever I go, I had plenty of space in the trunk for those items and more room to add grocery and other packages that I might of had.  I would suggest this vehicle for anyone with a large family, someone who likes to get good gas mileage and wants a comfortable ride from the beginning to the end.  I would not suggest this vehicle for a teenager who just want to joy ride and put wear and tear on the car.  I would not trade in my vehicle for any other vehicle.  I just going for my first tune-up at 60,000 miles and my car is still running just as good when I first brought it in 1995.  She quiet like a mouse.  Also, the car is a reasonable price for a Sedan.  The starting price of the vehicle is 15,000 and its worth it.  I don't suggest used car to anyone if you don't know who the previous owner is.  So, if you buy a used car, any type of car, make sure you get someone to study the car first and make sure it's in good condition, because if the previous owner traded it in for something else 9 times out of 10 something was wrong with the car from the beginning.
