            I bought this vehicle brand new in November of 1990, since then I have put 100,000 miles on it with no major repairs. I bought this truck because of Toyota's reputation for quality and so far, my truck has been very reliable.
I like this truck because of its styling, it's smooth ride for a four wheel drive truck and it's power in spite of only having a 4 cyl engine. 
My truck is smooth riding and comfortable, my only complaint is the high step up to get into it.  I have used it on several occasion to tow cars out of snow covered ditches.
I recommend this truck to anyone who wants the utility of a four wheel drive pickup and long lasting reliability. <br><br>
