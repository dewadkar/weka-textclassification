            I've read the previous 4 reviews of the '97 Lexus LX450, and found that I pretty much agree with the other owners.  I bought my '97 in April of '99 from Longo Lexus in El Monte, California with 44,000 miles.  I too had been looking for a Land Cruiser, but found that most of the ones on the market had the various blemishes and odors associated with being used as kid haulers.  My LX450, however, still smelled new and was practically immaculate.  It was only about $1500 more than a comparable Land Cruiser, which was definitely worth it considering the 6yr/100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.

The one problem we had from the beginning was the suspension rocking side to side at freeway speeds, which made for some interesting expletives coming from the passengers.  Longo Lexus told me that they had been researching the issue for about a year and determined that the problem was the insufficiently stiff sidewall of the Michelin LTX tires, and suggested that I buy a set of Dunlop Grand Treks from them for $175 a pop.  I found them at my local Just Tires for $79 each, and they did the trick.  I believe the Dunlops have been discontinued, so the other tire recommended is the Pirelli Scorpion.

The only thing missing from the LX450 is the cargo cover for the back, which is not available, so I ordered one for a Land Cruiser. The problem is that the attachment points aren't there behind the side panels, so I had to jerry-rig it by drilling holes in the panels and bolting it in from the inside.  

I wanted an SUV that I could keep forever.  I'm at 110,000 miles, and all is well.  This was obviously just a stop-gap measure for Lexus until the LX470 came out, since I can't imagine a $55,000 Lexus without memory seats or the electro-luminescent gauges.  Consider this a Land Cruiser with the Better Leather/CD Changer/Slightly Softer Ride package and ding-resistant body cladding.
