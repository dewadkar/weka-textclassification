            I have had my 2003 TL-S for about five months now. I researched several cars in the $30K range and could not find a better combination of luxury, sports and standard equipment at the price. I had read several good reviews about the TL and was in the market for something reliable (i.e. Japanese).

The main reason one would get a Type-S over the regular TL is for the magnificent engine. This beauty is smooth and quiet when you are cruising, but floor the accelerator and hold on! 260 horses are ready to throw you back in to your seat. When the revs reach 3500rpm, the VTEC kicks-in and you get a turbo-style shove that propels you forward very quickly. The transmission is a five-speed �manumatic� unit that allows you to change gears yourself or let the car do it for you. I use the manual mainly when entering highways, as I prefer to stay in third gear until I am safely merged. The fifth gear is very tall and for cruising only � at 70mph you are running at around 1800rpm. This does help the fuel economy though. In mixed driving I get 25-26mpg, which is not bad for a car that can do 0-60 in 6.5 seconds.

Personally, I find that the Transmission�s engine braking effect is just a little bit too noticeable for my taste. I believe that this has something to do with the car�s emissions control system. Nevertheless, it sometimes loses the smoothness that it normally has. On a related note, there are reports of a greater than average level of transmission failures on Type-S models in the 2002-2003 model years. Mine is OK so far and Acura has not issued any kind of recall for these models, so this is more of an FYI.

The ride quality is smooth and quiet unless you hit badly paved roads when it can get a little hard. Nevertheless, it always has a solid, quality feel even when things get rough. There is none of the crashing and banging that I have typically experienced with some other cars over bad roads. The handling is top-notch, despite being front-wheel drive. The car comes with anti-lock brakes, traction control and an anti-skid system, as well as side-airbags. 

Some have accused the TL of bland styling, but I find it clean and unfussy. The Type-S comes with 17-inch alloys and low-profile tires that greatly enhance its looks. Be careful when picking a color. Mine is Anthracite � I think that dark metallic colors suit the car best. I picked the black interior, which with the perforated leather looks awesome. The Type S with black interior gives you fake ebony-wood inserts on the doors and center console. Initially I disliked this, but have since grown use to them. Personally I would prefer some sort of aluminum or carbon fiber finish instead. Quality of materials is good, although Acura should consider using less stock Honda switchgear and design some more up-market items for itself. The center stack houses the excellent climate control system that is very easy to use and also the Bose 6-CD audio system. The latter is a nice system whose only fault is that I wish the steering wheel controls enabled me to change between Radio and CD and also change the CD track backwards as well as forwards.

Reliability has been excellent. I had two delivery problems that were fixed by the dealer � a rattling sunroof and a rear tire with a very slow leak.
