            I bought my 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T in 1996 with 12k miles on it.  Four and a half years later, it has 68k miles and drives exactly the same as it did the day I test drove it: absolutely wonderfully.

<b>Comfort:</b>
This is the only area that I've heard complaints about my car.  The back seat is <b>small.</b>  With tall occupants, the front seat passenger will probably be just as uncomfortable as the the person sitting behind him (or her).  With only two occupants, the seats adjust to make it an enjoyable ride.  But being a two door sports car, most of that is probably expected.

The suspension system is fairly tight providing excellent handling, but causing a slightly bumpy ride.  It's not terrible, but don't expect it to feel like a mid-size sedan.

<b>Handling:</b>
This car drives great.  The steering is tight and responsive making it an ease to drive.  The stiff suspension makes cornering outstanding.  My Eclipse has the anti-lock brakes which I would definitely recommend.  The ABS system gives the stopping control needed when driving a car with this much power.

NOTE: The GSX is a top of the line Eclipse.  It has the same features as a fully loaded GS-T plus an All-Wheel-Drive system to further improve handling.

<b>Engine:</b>
The intercooled, turbo-charged, 2.0 liter, 4 cylinder, 16 valve DOHC, producing 210hp will literally press you into your seat.  The acceleration and throttle response is tremendous.  This car will grip through a turn and accelerate nicer than anything in it's class.  It doesn't redline until 7000 rpm!  The turbo-charged engine provides unbelievable power with decent gas mileage (approximately 21 city / 27 highway).  If I'm not mistaken, the 140hp models get the same mileage as the 210hp GS-T.

NOTE: Only the GS-T and the GSX are turbo-charged.  The base, RS, and GS models are 2.0L 4-cylinder DOHC engines producing a modest 140hp.

<b>Reliability:</b>
Besides regular scheduled maintenance, the only reason it has ever been in the shop is for a new clutch master cylinder (~$250) and a thermostat.  Besides that, the car has been perfect.  Even with almost 70,000 miles on it, the car still drives with the power and responsiveness it did when it was new.

<b>Recommendation:</b>
If you are looking for the sportiness that the look of the Eclipse implies, buy a GS-T.  The 70 extra horsepower that the turbo provides puts this car into a different category.  If you are looking for a 1995 or 1996 it probably has over 60k miles so make sure it has had the recommended 60k mile service.  If not, expect to pay close to $1,000 to have it done.
