              I have had my Lexus LX 450 for about 8 months.  When I purchased it it already had 85k on it, which is obviously quite a bit.  My husband is in the car business so I got it at almost wholesale.  I don't know a lot about cars in technical terms but I have owned enough vehicles in my life to know this is a great one!
  It is huge and at 1st I felt like I was driving a bus.  Remarkably it is quite easy to handle though and the ride is very very smooth.  There is enough room for just about anything and the seats all flip down in any sort of configuration to accomodate whatever you want to haul.
  It gets good gas mileage for the size and I only need to fill it up about 1x a week.  It takes around $25 to fill it up depending on gas prices and how empty it was.  So far I have not had a single problem with this vehicle.  Prior to this I owned a 1993 BMW 325i which required a couple alternators and various other things during the short time I had it.  My only complaint would be that the turning radius is not too great causing me to make many 3 point turns but that may be my lack of superior driving ability as well.  
   I feel completely safe and protected in this big utility and the body styling is flashy and really nice.  I would recommend it to anyone with a family or an active person that likes to be able to pack up (really pack up) and go.<br><br>
