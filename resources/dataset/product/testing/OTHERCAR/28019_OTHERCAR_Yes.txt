            If you are buying a car to get you from point A to point B, with little irritant, this is your car.  I bought a '99 SE 4 door-sedan in metallic gold.  Its been a fairly reliable and easy car to own. There is nothing it does exceptionally well, but it does nothing truly bad either.

I find the car to be &quot;just right&quot; in size, its not too big or too little. Being a base sedan, it came well equipt with power door locks, air conditioning, tilt wheel, AM/FM/cassette, fog lights and cruise control. 

Inside you find a big meaty 4 spoke steering wheel. Instrumentation is first rate with a tach, speedo, fuel, engine temp gauges all glowing in a eye relaxing deep red @ night. Of course, there are plenty of idiot lights to remind you of things, but I wish it had an odometer that could be viewed @ the same time as the mileage meter.

There are lots of thoughtful nooks and crannys to store things in, but the front door pockets could be deeper. Perfect placement of remote trunk opener! Its located on the drivers door, making it easy to punch when you get out of the car and want to open the trunk.  

I have yet to find the perfect cupholders, and this car is no exception.  The two that are provided in the front can only hold cans.  I need one that will hold my 44 ounce &quot;Big Gulp&quot; I get every morning on the way to work. 

The drivers seat in my car seems &quot;saggy&quot;. I've driven a '99 SE1 with the power height adjustment. This feature's ability to adjust the height of the seat, would have solved my complaint, I think. I would strongly recommend going for the SE1 package, I wish I had! The front seats overall are comfortable, but could be more firmly padded.  The back seat sits low and you lean back further than I like. The rear glass/roof curviture causes your head/shoulders to be exposed to the sun, which can get uncomfortable quickly in the Texas summer.  GM should provide a rear sun shade, @ least as an option. Two adults in the back seat will be okay, three is pushing it. Rear seat leg room is okay, as long as the front seats are not pushed all the way back.

The trunk is roomy, even though the back seat doesn't fold down unless you order the SE1 package. The liner in my trunk does not &quot;fit&quot;. At the belt line of the trunk, the liner is in two seperate pieces that are supposed to fit over one another.  On mine, it dangles out on the sides.  I am constantly trying to tuck the fabric back in, but it comes out every time. A minor thing, but its irritating. Also, the trunk lid is hard to close. It usually requires two or three hard slams. I now have a small indent in the truck from slamming the trunk so hard with my hand.
  
I continue to get compliments on the looks of the car. I don't know why it surprises me, but every time a stranger comes up to me and tells me &quot;nice car&quot;, I always say &quot;thanks&quot;, but in my mind I'm thinking, &quot;hey, its only a BASE model&quot;! The paint application is good and the body panels feel &quot;sturdy&quot;. The doors have a nice &quot;thunk&quot; sound to them, but for some reason, the back doors never FEEL like they have closed. I always open them again and close them harder, just to make sure. Obsessive compulsive, I guess. Now, the left back door's interior light deflector pops out every time I slam the door closed...I finally gave up and just left it out. 

Those infamous side plastic panels that create such design debate are a bit on the gaudy side, but they sure keep the door ding monster away! No complaints from me. 

The base plastic wheel covers although somewhat attractive, sound like they are going to crack when you hit a bump. Very, irritating.

As far as the engine goes, I get what I would call &quot;peppy&quot; performance from the base 4 cylinder engine. It can be loud (thrashy) when you stomp the pedal, but its not bad. I get good gas mileage. I've never measured my MPG's, but if I had to guess, I'd say I am getting in the low 20's in mostly city driving.  I have had no mechanical problems other than one time it mysteriously refused to start (of course I was about 300 miles from home!). When it was towed to the shop, nothing could be found wrong and it started right up again.  ????  Hasn't happened since. 

So what do I not like about my Grand Am? Well, I hate the daytime running lights! I almost did not buy this car based on it having them.  GM makes it difficult to disconnect them. If you pull the fuse (which I tried the minute I brought it home), you do without gauge lights + an idiot light remains lighted all the time.  You also have to deal with an additional number of very loud warning chime notes every time you start the car. I would really like to have the option to turn my own lights on or off! GM should make them a no/low cost option like Toyota does. What may make sense in Canada, doesn't make sense in most of the USA. 

Speaking of chime notes, when your gas tank nears empty a very LOUD chime warns you (along with a light on the dash).  The chime startles me EVERY TIME! It also scares your passengers, and you have to start explaining to them that &quot;every thing is okay&quot;. GM has gone overboard on all of the various lights, chimes and reminders their cars come with. They must think we are all idiots. Probably afraid of a law suit because somebody has sued them for running out of gas and the car not telling them to fill up!  
 
I have had a recurring problem with my gas cap.  If you don't put the gas cap on &quot;just right&quot;, the &quot;check-engine&quot; light comes on the dash. I've also had an electrical demon in the dash that makes the gas gauge fly between E &amp; F (which causes that loud chime to go off!), I think its related to the same problem with the gas cap. ??? Last time I took the car in for maintenance, they checked it out and couldn't find anything wrong. They referred me to my owners manual about properly putting the gas gap on. I can't seem to find out what I am doing wrong. ???

The brakes make me a little nervous. Again, they FEEL a little weak. I've found myself on several occasions mashing the pedal down harder than I expected to have to.

I know it seems like I am just needling this car to death, but I really like it.  We also own a '99 Honda Prelude and an  '96 Acura Integra SE. I love the Prelude, its fun to drive, has great power and looks, but I constantly worry about parking it near other cars for fear of door dings.  If I hear a rattle in it, I complain because a Honda shouldn't rattle! With the Grand Am, we just get in it, drive and don't worry about those little things. It has some minor rattles, but I sort of expected them from this car @ this price.
