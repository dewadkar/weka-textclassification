            I bought a 1999 Acura Integra LS in January and so far, its the best decision I've made this year.  This is my first ever new car and I couldn't be happier.

As my first ever new car, I wanted to make sure that I walked away with something that I wasn't just happy with, but with something that I would love to drive.  The Acura Integra is just that.

One of the best things about it is it hugs the road and is nothing but a smooth ride, even when transversing the bumpiest of roads.  All you hear is the musical hum of your engine, or if you have the radio on, nothing but sweet music in your ears.  The standard Integra model should come with a sunroof (great on sunny days), a CD stereo (Acura has one of the best factory made stereos), and power locks and windows.  It is also a beautiful car to look at when you're not driving.  Simply put, you get all the luxury of a top of the line car at a very affordable price.

If you're shopping for this car, make sure you're getting wheel locks and floor mats with the deal.  My dealership tried to make me pay an extra $600 for those things.  So be sure to ask for them upfront and get a price quote with everything.  You shouldn't have to pay more than $200 for the locks and mats.

I test drove Civics, Accords, and Audis and nothing was smoother than the Acura Integra. If you're looking for a stick shift, this Acura shifts easily from gear to gear -- you'll be amazed at how easy the car picks up the shifts.  There's no stuttering or stalling, its as though you're driving an automatic (even smoother!).

About the only downside I can think of with the car is that there is not much leg space for your passengers in the back.  But as the driver, you sit very comfortably!  All the electronic controls are within hand's reach. One other thing to consider (if it bothers you) is that Acura has had this same model out for several years now.  I've been told that Acura might come out with a new car model in the near future so if you're in to that kind of stuff, its something to think about.

Otherwise, simply put -- if you're looking for a great car under $20,000 that is sporty, slick, and fun to drive, this is the car for you.<br><br>
