            I bought this car 2 years ago after I totaled my 1992 Cavalier.  This was definitely a step up from the Cavalier in comfort, ride and ergonomics, but lacked ABS (this IS the base SL model, you know.)

I knew the history of the car, because my brother bought it new, then sold it to me.  He had let his son drive it for a year, then decided to sell it to me after the clutch went out, probably due to genetics more than the car (my brother has never been able too keep a clutch in a car.)  It was cheap at $1200 with 127,000 miles.

He of course fixed it before he gave it to me.  Unfortunately, he had a friend do it, and it wasn&#146t done quite right.  After plugging in the speedometer (something his friend forgot to do), I found it only got 20MPG, so I took it to the dealer and they fixed the problem (can&#146t remember now what it was, that was 2 years ago.)  I paid  $300, and besides the wait, it was a pleasant experience.

After a year with a 16-year-old, the body had seen its better days.  The hood, roof and trunk all had been walked on, thus the only places on the car that could dent, looked worse than being in a hail storm.  He also hit something with the right front bumper, which smudged it, but didn&#146t damage it, and there was a crack in the front fender.  How come 16-year-old boys can&#146t get along with cars?

While it was rugged and rough, it was ready for me.  And it wasn&#146t like it had to look good, it just had to get me where I was going.  I liked the ride, and it was comfortable inside.  The original stereo had seen its better days, so I got a used GM AM/FM cassette, and a couple pair of Jensen 6 ï¿½&#148 speakers, all for under $100, and it jams.

I do a lot of highway traveling, and at 65-75mph, it does pretty well.  When traveling on 2 lane highways, I have no problem in passing, just shift down to 4th, and zoom right around.  The engine is rated at 100hp, so I was pleasantly surprised with this.  Even going 85-90 one time, the car tracked well and wasn&#146t pushed around by semis.  The car can be a little buzzy, though, something Saturns are famous for, but it isn&#146t extremely annoying, especially with the stereo up.  

I am very happy with the gas mileage.  I am averaging around 34mpg, and when on the highway I have peaked at 39.5mpg (so close to 40mpg, I can taste it.)  I usually fill up when I am close to empty, and I have gotten several 400 mile tankfulls.  It has a 12.5-gallon tank, but I have never had to fill it more than 11.5.

It also burns a little oil.  It was only slightly annoying before, getting 3-4 tanks per quart of oil, but now it is up to 1-2.  Only time will tell if it gets worse, but I don&#146t think it will/can.  I have heard from other owners that their Saturns burn a little oil, so this is normal.

Recently the engine was running rough, coughing, hiccupping, etc.  I had left the oil cap off, so I thought that was the problem, but it wasn&#146t that easy.  I took it into the dealer, for only the second time since I owned it, and they said it was a sensor.  I had to drive it home and wait for the part to come in, then when I went in the next day they installed the sensor, but found that wasn&#146t it.  It wound up being the coil, which I had them replace.  It also needed new plug wires and plugs, so I caved and got them, too, even though I knew I could do it for less, and wound up leaving $300 lighter, but with a car that runs very well again.

While most of the body panels are plastic, there is some rust on the back doors near the c-pillars.  Otherwise I have no complaints with the exterior of the vehicle.  The interior, while full of plastic, has never had a problem, either.  The climate controls are a little low on the dash, but they are easy to use, and offer enough options between defrost/vent/heater to make you happy.  I wish I had cruise control, though.

I wanted a hatchback, after having a 2 door Cavalier with absolutely no utility.   This 4 door with 60/40 fold down rear seats isn&#146t so bad.  I can almost put my bike all the way in back, and it was even helpful in moving my stuff 45 miles to my new apartment recently.  

This car now has 160,000  miles on it, and shows no signs of stopping.  It is currently my girlfriend&#146s daily driver, and she has a 200 mile round trip 4 days a week.  I had to put the third set of tires on it this spring.  Once it gets through those, maybe then I will have the money to buy something new.  Until then, this car definitely does the trick.

NEW: My girlfriend... she is always making me look bad.  With her driving mostly highway to and from work, at 100 miles each way, she is now getting 42mpg.  And I could never get 40 myself. :C
