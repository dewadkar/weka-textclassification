            My friend owns a Dodge Stratus and the car has not been the most reliable. The Car has been in the shop quite a bit, much more than my father's ten year old '90 Lincoln Town Car. I strongly urge anyone considering buying this car to look at the reliability and consider that when purchasing this vehicle. The looks are attractive in the modern sort of way and is nothing to be ashamed of like an old '89 oldsmobile or a hatchback. The acceleration is impressive and could be a good vehicle for someone looking for performance out of a vehicle cheaper and more reliable than the mustang or the camaro. The interior is mediocre and not worthy of a rave review. 
When one assesses the stratus one must realize that it is not an expensive car and will not act like one. The performance is great compared to cars in its category and its reliability is not that bad when compared to cars in its class. Overall for its class of car it is a good buy.<br><br>
