            I love my Toyota 4Runner.  Before we bought it we had a Chevrolet Astro Van which we needed because our children were smaller and we needed the room to haul them and their friends.  Now they are almost grown and no longer go with us as much.  We went looking for a new vehicle and my husband was looking at a Toyota Camry but I really didn't want a car because I was used to sitting up so high in the van.  I am short and I love being able to look out over the other vehicles.  I spotted the 4Runner and fell in love.   It has a sun roof and rides like a dream. The only problem we have had is a vibration that we can't find the cause of.
I would recommend it to my friends and would buy another one.<br><br>
