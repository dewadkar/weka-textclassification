       Last year we bought a new blazer.  Its a red one with gray and red seats.  We got the four door because its a lot easier to get my in-laws in and out of.  I just love this vehicle because I have night blindness and with the blazer I can still drive at night.  The reason being is you sit up high in the car and the on coming car lights don't blind you.  I still have a little problem with other sport utility vehicles and trucks coming my way but its a whole lot better than before.  The 4-wheel drive is nice except we haven't had snow since we got the car.

     There is so much room in the back.  We have even put the seats down and let the grandkids roll out their sleeping bags on over nighters.  Its great when I go grocery shopping.  Instead of trying to stuff all the groceries in the back seat I just open the hatch and pile them in.  

     We did have to have the springs on the doors handles replaced once already and they need to be replaced again.  What happens is, when you open the door, the handle doesnt spring back then you can't open the door without a key even if its unlocked.

     Our car is red in color and I wouldnt recommend that color.  Its very  hard to keep shiny.  You end up doing alot of polishing.

     We will never buy anything else but a sports vehicle.<br><br>
