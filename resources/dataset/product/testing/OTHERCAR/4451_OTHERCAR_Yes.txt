            Believe it or not we started out seriously looking at SUV's but just could not get past the SIZE and gas consumption of those things.  As I pondered the whole reason to trade I found really wanted something distinctive and FUN to drive.  I wanted something with some �soul� and just a bit of flash.  I knew I didn't want yet another boring sedan and pickups leave me cold.  A convertible however... What an idea!  Next was to filter it down to American, Japanese or European.  American cars have lately not been my cup of tea so no thanks to that. I was trading a boring Japanese sedan and the thought of another of those was definitely not on the list.  Most of the European convertibles are a bit rich for my blood but the Cabrio held promise.  My first test drive was not overwhelming as the car felt a bit short and stiff.  However, the interior was wide enough to be comfortable for me and we really liked the way it handled, looked (dark green with black leather interior and black roof) the heated seats, CD changer and power conveniences so we bought it.

First my rants 

I have found the seats themselves a bit narrow, front leg room a bit short (I am 5� 11�) and the steering wheel a bit too far away.  It took me a while to find a seating position I could live with. A telescoping steering wheel would have helped, the wheel does tilt but I found that useless.  A rattle developed that I traced to loose bolts below the instrument panel.  The VERY BLUE instrument panel lighting is not a favorite. The front cup holders are really only useful for small paper coffee cups � forget putting any kind of mug in there. I sat in the back once and it�s an experience strictly for occasional kids and small pets.  

Lastly my raves

On the pro side the car is very maneuverable, fun to drive and easy to park.  The engine has adequate power with a standard transmission.  Heater, AC and gas mileage are terrific. The headlights deserve special mention as they are very effective. Putting down the top is easy and it makes the ride to/from work a hoot. Very little wind noise with the top up or down, easy to have a conversation either way.  Its fun to drive and I feel it has the bit of �soul� that I was looking � all for at least 1/2 the price of its European competition.  

Great car for commuting and weekend trips for two.
