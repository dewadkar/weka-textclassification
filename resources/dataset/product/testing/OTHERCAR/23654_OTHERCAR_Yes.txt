            The title should explain it all.  I am definitely technologically challenged.  I am a gadget user.  Show me how to turn it on, and I'll be OK.  Just don't ask me how it works.  I could not tell you and I could not care less.

This digital camera, the FinePix 2650, is exactly what I needed to take pictures for ebay and of my new home construction for all of the family to see.  Just point, and click and watch the screen.  With picture taking being so easy, what could make a digital camera better?  Easy Downloading (or is it called uploading?)  Well either way, I can get the pictures directly from my camera to my auctions or websites without taking up precious space on my hard drive.  I am in love!  This camera has several other great features, but I let my husband enjoy them.  One day when I need them, I will find out how they work.

This camera takes such great pictures, that I used it to take pictures of my model brother n law that actually were good enough for his portfolio.  Before this camera, my pictures always came out crooked or blurry.  It's a miracle!

Features:
2 mega pixels 
High performance 3x zoom lens; 2.5 digital zoom 
Auto focus 
20 Sec video mode 
Eats 2 AA batteries 
4-mode flash
5x zoom playback 
Playback mode 

Includes:
16MB Smart Media card 
2 AA batteries 
USB cable 
FinPix Viewer software, which did not work with my computer, my husband downloaded something else that worked fine.

update:  11 months into ownership the screen blanked out so I called for service.  I had to mail the camera and the receipt (keep the receipt) to the NJ plant to have repaired.  I got it back over 2 month later.... almost as good as new.

Service was slow, but good.
