            Me and My husband bought 1988 RX-7 early last year, and it has given us a fun ride for 2 years...Rx-7 is his dream car, and we got it for unbelievable deal from a guy who needed to move soon. 
The car is missing a few accessary parts like stereo panel(frame) and one of the power window switch,  but it is fast and so much fun to drive.
I never even knew RX-7 until we bought it, but I am totally in love with it now. 
It is so sad that we have to sell it now because we now have a baby, and 
cannot afford to keep one extra (2 seated) car...well, my husband secretly hopes I guess that no one wants to buy it so that we have no other choice but keep it!!

The only problem it has is that because it has a unique rotary engine, if something happens to engine, it is hard to find a right mechanic to work on it...we luckily have a nice mechanic who specializing in Rx-7, but believe me, many car care service places and mechanics would say, &quot;Sorry, we don't work on Rx-7.&quot; Make sure to check before buying if someone near you can work on the car when it needs any repairs...
The parts can cost very much, too, but there are a lot of rx-7 lovers on net and you can find where to get a right parts online. I would recommend www.Mazdatrix.com...they got almost everything you would need!

In the past 2 years, it did gives us some problems. 
We replaced the whole transmission($800),computer twice (around $120 each),water pump, starter and electric wires...Surprisingly, we still love it. I guess I am so in love with it, We just happy when it takes us to a nice ride. 

Be careful and not to let the car overheated, you really wanna avoid any damage that might affect engine area for this car.
This car will run for you for long time, if you take care of it good.

I should say, it is a nice project car, if you got time and money to spend on it. There are so many thing you can do to the car to fix up nice.
If I did not stop him, my husband would spent all his money on the car,(not for repair, but for &quot;fixing up nice.&quot;) He wants to make the car looks like it does not even look like Rx-7...Ladies, be careful, when your man got this kind of cars...
My friend's husband just got Rx-7, too, and he started spending a whole lot of money on it, for sound system and all that. 
IT IS NOT A FAMILY CAR, it is for a single person, or a couple who simply loves a super-cool car for a fast ride.
