            My husband bought me this car for my birthday, we traded in a 1996 Acura Integra that I thought I loved. This car was incredible. I was most impressed by the powerful 3.0 V6 engine. I was in a sales position that required me to drive around in heavy traffic all day. It was a secure feeling to have that power to pull out in traffic or to go around someone on the freeway. The Bose sound system was great.I loved having sound controls on the steering wheel. I most noticed the difference when I switched from my CL a Honda Accord. It was the smoothest car in both performance and amenities that I have ever owned.<br><br>
