            Although we have had pretty good use out of our 96 Nissan Altima, we had one bad experience recently. That being the engine distributor failed, and the engine quit running. Brought it in to a local Nissan dealer, and the repair cost, including towing, was over $ 700. The cost alone for a REMANUFACTURED distributor was $ 450. Add the $ 150 labor, plus 4 spark plugs and tax, with a $ 45 tow bill, and presto, $ 700.

What was really sad is the fact that our car had less than 85,000 miles on it.

What failed was the o-ring seal on the horizontal shaft distributor. Engine oil leaked into the distributor, and ruined it.

The local Nissan dealer said that distributor failures were fairly common, but generally occurred over 100,000 miles.

I contacted Nissan today, and they basically said "sorry", but your warranty ran out some 40,000 plus miles ago.

I detailed in writing that I had owned, or operated Ford, Chevy, Buick, Mazda vehicles that ALL went over 100,000 miles without a distributor failure, and that my two daughters have cars with way over 100,000 miles with original distributors on each. Even my 11 year old Isuzu truck, has the same amount of mileage, about 85,000, and it has never given me distributor problems.

I advised the Nissan rep that our 96 Altima was the first, and LAST Nissan we will ever buy in our lifetime. 

Sorry, Nissan, your critical engine parts are so shodddy and short lived.  

Other Altima owners, get ready for a BIG repair bill!

Sign me, a disgruntled Altima owner.
