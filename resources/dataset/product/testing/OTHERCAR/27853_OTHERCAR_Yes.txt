            We went vehicle shopping when we got our income tax this year.  We knew we didn't want to buy anything we had to make payments on because we just couldn't stretch another payment out of our monthly finances.  We came across the 1994 Dodge Caravan at a Buy Here, Pay Here.  Of course, I know we are supposed to stay away from these places unless we want to get burned but we didn't have many choices.

I examined the van inside and out, under the hood and under the van itself, looking for anything that didn't look right.  We test drove it and was very pleased with how well it handled the road as well as how quite it was.

Upon returning to the lot, we haggled with the dealer.  The asking price was already somewhat low for a van but we needed it to be a bit lower because of taxes and tag.  I offered $3,500 and not a penny more.  The dealer scratched his head and acted upset but in the end, he gave it up.  It's not every day that someone comes in and is looking to hand over cash.  Plus, I knew that if he really couldn't afford to let it go, he wouldn't have.  It's my guess he bought it really cheap at an auction where many small car dealerships get their vehicles.

Because of the low price, we were still leary of what we may have bought into but the parts to fix this particular model are readily available and inexpensive so we decided to not worry about it.

Since we bought it, we have taken trips to Florida from Georgia and back, been all over our local area, and driven in rain and ice.  The Caravan still handles very well.

With two bench seats in the back of the van and built in car seats, our family rides comfortably anywhere we need to go.  There's no more crying about being squashed and groceries fit nicely in the back.  Captain's chairs occupy the front area of the van and recline easily enough without laying back on the persons in the middle seats.

The only thing we have had a problem with was when we had a flat tire in Orlando, Florida.  First, the van rides so smooth, we had no idea that the tire was going flat.  If not for a good citizen driving down the road and honking to let us know, we might have ended up on the side of the Interstate rather than safe at a gas station.  Also, the spare tire is stored UNDER the van and we had no idea how to get it out as the vehicle manual was no longer with the van.  It took over an hour of us trying to figure out how to get the tire off before someone with a Caravan came along to show us the &quot;magic&quot; bolt to turn -- it's under the carpet in the back of the van, in case you don't know yet.

Other than that, we have had no problems.  It actually does well on gas mileage ... that is, before the recent gas hikes. A do-it-yourself oil change is a breeze though it might be recommended to have someone else change spark plugs (three are in very hard to reach spots.)

Overall, if you have the opportunity to purchase one of these vehicles, chances are that you will be pleased with your buy. <br><br>
