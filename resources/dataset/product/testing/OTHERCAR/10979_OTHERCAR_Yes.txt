            The 3 In One Car!

We are a family of five and about two years ago we were in the market for a family vehicle.  We have had years of success with Toyota so naturally we looked at the Land Cruiser.  It was nice but small, just barely bigger than the Four Runner.  I begged my husband to consider the Suburban.  I test drove it and turned to my husband and said &quot;This car is a three way solution for our family.  It is a luxury car like I prefer to drive.  It is a large family vehicle with plenty of room for all of our sporting activities.  And it is a truck which makes you happy!&quot;  We bought it almost two years ago.

We have been overly satisfied but still very nervous about the longevity that we will get out of this vehicle.  It has been &quot;four wheeling&quot; and does a great job around town.  We have had as many as 9 adults in the car at one time and still found room for luggage.  <br><br>
