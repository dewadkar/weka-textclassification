            We bought the Dodge Grand Caravan three months after buying a Plymouth Grand Voyager (same vehicle, different grill).  Unfortunately, a forty foot tree fell on our Voyager.  The salesman, however, was happy to see us (not happy about the tree)!

We decided to buy the Grand Caravan instead of a Caravan, because it offers you eleven more inches in length.  And we needed it!  With a third baby on the way, we needed more room for our growing family.

Traveling, whether to move or to visit family, is made easier with the Grand Caravan.  My husband is in the military and we move a lot, which means you have to carry lots of toys and household products with you.

It was a top of the line vehicle and we adored it.<br><br>
