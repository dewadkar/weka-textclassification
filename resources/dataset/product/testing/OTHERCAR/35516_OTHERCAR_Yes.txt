            I&#146ve seen so many digital camera&#146s that it has almost gotten to the point where they all blend together. Pentax&#146s new Optio 450 digital stands out of the pack thanks to extremely high quality pictures with a  camera of a very small size.

There are two major features that make this camera stand out ahead of the pack.

First is the size, it&#146s small. 3.9x2.3x1.6 Inches as a matter of fact. It fits comfortably in the palm of your hand, and at 8 oz you might even forget it&#146s there. Are there smaller cameras? Yes. Are there very many? No. Are there any in this price range? Yes. Are there any in this price range at this quality? Not that I&#146m aware of.

The second awesome feature is the quality of the image. It has a digital precision of 4.0 megapixels, which is absolutely phenomenal. If you took the same picture with standard 35 mm film and this camera, the quality difference would be clear. It has good zooming ability, up to 20x. It also has what has become a standard feature on digital cameras: a high resolution 1.5 inch LCD color screen to show the picture before you take it. As a step up from most digital camera&#146s, this screen offers higher resolutions then most. 

Other Features:

Now, outside of my personal field of expertise a little bit. It has a ton of different shooting options, just to list from the manual:
Metered Manual, Shutter-priority AE, Aperture-priority AE, Program, Picture, Movie, Panorama Assist, 3D image, Digital Filter, and User.

Personally I always just let the camera determine what to do (and it&#146s pretty good at that) 
but if you&#146re in the mood to go crazy, it&#146ll let you. 

In terms of image editing there are lots of options for, &#147soft&#148 filters (like putting a piece of colored plastic over the lense to change the tone of the shot) that I find amusing, but not particularly helpful. More helpful I find is the ability to manually set the brightness, contrast, and saturation levels for the shot. 

It also has video recording abilities, but it does so poorly and can only record 10 seconds of video and 30 seconds of audio at a time. If you want to record digital video and audio, there are far better ways to do it then using this digital camera.

Asthetics:

From the point of asthetics it also works well. The button configuration is good, and the camera is well designed to the hand to make for easing holding (a must with a camera this small.) The buttons are well sized to the camera (small) and work efficiently and effectively. As far as I can tell buttons can&#146t be re-programmed, but that would mostly be a pipe dream as I only know of one camera that does allow its buttons to be re-programmed. 

Transfering Files:

In terms of transferring files to the desktop, it is fairly standard. It has a USB connection and you can simply click and drag files onto the machine, or use the basic, but functional, included software. The card can be replaced with higher capacity cards, but I havn&#146t yet found that necessary. I have never reached the, &#147limit&#148 of the camera&#146s storage capacity and I&#146ve, thus far, had at most 100 pictures on it at one time.

Bottom Line:
Size: A+
Weight: A
Picture Quality: A
Battery Life: A
Movies: C
Audio: C
Ease of Use: A-
Overall: A (I don&#146t really care about movies or audio)
