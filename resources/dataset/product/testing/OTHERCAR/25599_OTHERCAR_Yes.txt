            After deciding on the Saab 9-3 for many of the reasons that other reviewers here did, we found out about the &quot;Saab European Delivery Program&quot;.

Overall, the setup was a fantastic deal (saving us money over buying it on the lot) and we had a wonderful vacation.

If you decide on a Saab, I strongly recommend the European delivery option.

There are many great aspects to cruising around Sweden in your new car.  First, Sweden is a beautiful country with over 10% of the land area covered by alpine lakes.  The roads are in wonderful shapes and police cars are rare, so you can cruise!  Also, the Swedish people are nature lovers, and signs along the highways point out points of interest, hiking trails and rooms for rent (often cozy little cabins for around US $20).  The 9-3's front seats recline quite a bit -- we slept in the car two of the nights!

If you are not interested in Sweden, the program even allows you to pick up your car in other countries for an additional fee ($200 - $500).

As an added an unexpected bonus, by the time we got the car and I managed to take it in to register, I was past the statute of limitations in Washington for paying sales tax (90 days from purchase).  This was a savings of 8.8%!<br><br>
