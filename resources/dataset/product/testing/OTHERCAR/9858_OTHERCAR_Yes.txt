            One of the best rivalries in the sports car market is the one between the Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Camaro.  I have owned both of these pony cars and have an opinion on each.  Like anything, these two cars have their advantages and disadvantages.  I am comparing the 90 - 93 model years of each of these cars.  In my opinion, the mustang runs away from the camaro in every category.  From bang for the buck to build quality, the ford clearly defeats the Chevy.  I have owned a 1990 IROC-Z28 Camaro, a 1991 Mustang 5.0 LX, and currently own a 1992 Mustang GT convertible.  Each of us have different things we look for in prospective cars.  Performance is one of the most important qualities of these cars to me.  Performance is the strong point of the 5.0 liter powered mustangs, they simply run away from the 5.0 and 5.7 liter camaros.  In my opinion, the mustangs are just more of a practical everyday driver than the camaros.  They receive better MPG as well as being more comfortable.  My camaro was always having mechanical difficulties, despite the fact of it's low mileage.  Where as my 1991 5.0 LX mustang accumulated over 153,000 miles and rarely ever did it need anything other than a simple oil change.  I believe they are simply built better.  Not to mention that these year mustangs can be found for very reasonable prices.  The aftermarket of performance parts that stands behind the 5.0 liter mustangs is incredible.  So enhancing performance even more is very very easy to do.  They are simply very fun cars to drive.  These are the reasons that I only drive mustang 5.0s.<br><br>
