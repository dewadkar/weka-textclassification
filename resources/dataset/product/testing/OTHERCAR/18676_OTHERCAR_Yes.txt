            We have recently had to buy new digital cameras for the company that I work for. We needed to purchase 7 new ones to go in each of the computer labs that we run on the Washington State University campus. So, of course, we needed something that is going to both last a long time, and be of quality use during that time. This ruled out any generic brands, and what we ended up going with was Sony. In the past we have had many Sony products, and they have all treated us well, so it was assumed that if we were looking for a digital camera that we should look at Sony first. There was a short amount of time spent looking before we settled on the MVC-FD92 Mavica Digital Still Camera produces by Sony. 

The Camera itself is nice in its own set-up. It is built with one side (the front) of the camera having the eyepiece on the far right side, and flash on the middle of the front. On the front there is also a shutter button, and a photocell window for the flash itself. The side under the lens on the right side of the camera has ACC Jack, the A/V out Jack, and the DC in jack. While, on the top of the camera there is a built in microphone. The backside almost looks like a video game console in its set up though. You have a video screen set up on the left side of the back, with the volume buttons located directly to the left of that screen. Directly underneath it you have your power, flash, focus, program, and display buttons. The set-up with all of these functions is done really well with the camera, and it comes off looking very professional when you are using it. 

The power supply for this camera is a Lithium battery that is installed on the bottom of the camera. It is very easy to install, and slides in with the touch of a button. Depending on what type of battery you get for the camera, it may last a longer period of time. The one supplied is a NP-F330 and last this amount of time for each task: 

continuous recording: 70 minutes 
continuous playback: 80 minutes 

You can basically get 750 images in that time span, and they are all of a high quality as well. The battery is very easy to recharge, as well as to reuse. The recharging process is always supposed to be done with the battery still in the camera as well. A good idea when recharging though, is to remove the disk from the camera so as not to risk losing any of the pictures that you might have taken. 

This camera is one of the ones that make it very easy to both take, and delete pictures. It has the feature so that if you take a picture and you do not like it, you can delete it immediately and take another one. You can also choose to just save that picture and move on to another one. The pictures themselves are very easy to download to a computer, and even a novice could master it with the instructions that are given in the pamphlet. What we have found is that these cameras are very satisfying to the customers here, because they are always able to see what they are taking a picture of before they even take it. It is a huge step up from the past where we would have to wait to develop the film before we were able to see if a picture really came out of not. 

This camera seems to have a million things to offer to any consumer, but here are just a few of the more important ones in my opinion: 

-floppy-disk with camera so that you do not have to download to the computer. 
-Memory-stick 32-byte 
-USB connectivity to computers 
-1.6 mega pixels 
-1 1/2 x 2 inch LCB 
-film less (no development) 
-easy to send through e-mail or to post on the web 
-close to 100 minutes on full-charge with batteries 
-easily printed through Epson photo-quality printers 
-takes movies (15-seconds) (short video clips) 
-16X zoom 
-records sound (built in microphone) 
-Can view like video-effects 

That is just the tip of the ice-berg because this camera can be the easiest camera to use you have ever had. One of the biggest bonuses of all though, is that the camera is quite durable. With a lot of use, the lens has avoided getting scratched, the viewer has avoided getting ruined, and the camera has survived being dropped. Now I do not advise that you go out and experiment with dropping it yourself, but I do think it will survive any potential accidental drops that may occur. 

Once again we are extremely satisfied with a product that Sony has produced. I have yet to come across one that has any problems yet. It is because of this, that I highly recommend that you give Sony a try. But, if you are just in the market for a nice digital camera, then give this one a try before you look at anything else.
