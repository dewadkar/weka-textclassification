            This is probably the best digital camera on the market thats priced under $1000.

At the size of a grapefruit, this little camera has the best ergonomic fit in the palm of your hands.  It is shaped so well, that its easier to simply carry it with your right hand than to carry it in its soft leather case.  Its very hard to put this camera down.

Theres probably 150 nice features about this camera but since you don't want me to rewrite the whole manual here, I'll just pick the three that I like best.

The first would have to be the switchable LCD screens.  This camera comes with the standard 1 x 1.5 inch LCD screen on the back which, by the way, has various levels of brightness for those bright outdoor daytime shots. In addition, there is a smaller LCD screen inside the viewfinder that is exactly the same as the one on the back. You can toggle the display between the two screens in accordance with your preferred shooting style.

Personally, I like to use the viewfinder screen for two reasons: I can hold the camera in the normal shooting position instead of awkwardly away from my body and it also prolongs the battery life by a significant amount.

My second most favorite feature is the optional wide angle conversion lens (WL-FX9) and teleconversion lens (TL-FX9). These accessories practically turn your 6900 into a fully functioning SLR camera complete with an adapter ring that can also fit standard commercially available filters.

The 6900 lens by itself is already powerful with a very large focusing range from a slightly wide 34mm to a huge 210mm for an unparalleled 6x built-in optical zoom. A digital zoom pushes it into the 10x range but digital zoom is a fake zoom so I don't pay any attention to those figures. When powered on, the camera sets up the lens to 50mm - perfect for portrait and group shots. Press the zoom out button conveniently located on the left side of the lens barrel, and you can take some serious landscape and architectural shots.

For even greater possibilities, the wide converter accessory will enhance the 34mm lens to a 27mm superwide while the teleconverter accessory pushes the 210mm to a 315mm for an incredible optical zoom of 9.5x! These accessory lenses only weigh a combined total of 10 ounces so the additional weight that you'll be carrying around is not affected in any large way. The total combined weight with the two accessory lenses is 1.7 pounds - about the same as my Canon EOS Rebel with the standard 28-105mm lens.

My third most favorite feature is the rapid fire shot also known as continuous shooting. The 6900Z allows a 5 shot per second burst for taking pictures of children at play or for anything with unpredictable movement.

This is my number one choice for a digital camera that is priced under $1000.  The 6 megapixel files that this camera can generate easily surpasses the quality of the 35mm film format. So high are the quality of the pictures, that some of them seem to be 3 dimensional when viewed on a high resolution 21" monitor. The depth perception is almost eerie.

As with all digital cameras, I highly recommend purchasing at least one extra battery. These things suck a lot of juice and most of them use proprietary li-on batteries. The Fuji 6900Z does pretty good on battery life if you use the viewfinder LCD - horrible if you use the standard LCD.
