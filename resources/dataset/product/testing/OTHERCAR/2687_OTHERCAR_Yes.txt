            The Mountaineer is a very good Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). It looks like the kind of SUV that would drive like a truck, but it really drives like a car. Also it has nice seats and a big trunk. For example, one day I had to pick up my son from football practice and he was socking wet, so I put him in the trunk. In the trunk I have a rubber mat. I also have mats for in front of the seats.<br><br>
