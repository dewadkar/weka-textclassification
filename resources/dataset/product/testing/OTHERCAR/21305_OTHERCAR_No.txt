            I should have just handed over my wallet and entire earnings for a year IN ADDITION to what I paid for my Sundance, which was purchased new in 1994.  EVERYTHING has gone in that car - a tie-rod end snapped in half, almost killing my husband, because it happened in the middle of traffic.  The mechanic who fixed it said he'd never seen such a thing ever happen before!  At three years the transmission needed to be replaced (it's an automatic).  The thing has squeaked since I bought it.  Several mechanics told me it was the alternator belt - the problem was I kept getting the damn alternator belts changed and the squeak remains!

An the machine has absolutely NO power.  If you are going up the slightest incline, you can have the pedal nailed to the floor and it will still go just 20 miles per hour while the rest of the world zooms past you.  (Probably laughing!)

Because of my terrible experience with this vehicle and a Ford Topaz I previously owned, my husband and I have vowed to only buy foreign made cars.  We now own a Honda Civic in addition to the Sundance (I'm keeping the latter and driving it into the ground, because I'll NEVER get my money's worth!).  The Civic is wonderful and if it remains that way we'll be buying all our vehicles from the Honda company!
