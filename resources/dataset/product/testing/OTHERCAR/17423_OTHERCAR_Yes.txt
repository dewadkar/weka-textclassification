            Let me begin by stating that I wasn't really in the market for a sports utility, but when I did decide, 4Runner won out over three other competitors in my book.  I wanted a vehicle that was reliable, easy on gas, could hold to the road, and would keep up with the traffic on I-95.
It is &quot;Toyota&quot; reliable, I have had it now for two years and purchased it new. It holds to the road during rain, high winds and snow.  The size of the automobile makes driving on I-95 less of a chore then driving in a passenger car. You get more respect from the 16-18 wheelers.  The drive is smooth until you hit a bump. You tend to feel it partly because of the large tires I believe.  The smoke/tinted glasses are great for both aesthetics and security.  The available &quot;add-ons&quot; enhance the auto's features.  In looks its more appealing (to me) then its competitors. It is easy to maneuver and is easy on gas while driving on the interstate.  Can be a guzzler though if most of your driving is in the city. 

Things I wished I had considered:   I have a parent who suffers from LUPUS.  She also has friends who are older (55-60+) who have difficulties in getting around, but who are always in need of a ride.  I sometimes suffer from sprained ligaments myself.  THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO CONSIDER AS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLIMB UP INTO THIS VEHICLE. One must be careful with breaking in this vehicle at high speeds.  Due to the size it took me a long to adapt to breaking as the vehicle will sometimes 'slide' two-three feet after breaks are applied.  Keep in mind this is MY First Utility so this may be the norm.   <br><br>
