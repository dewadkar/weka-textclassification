            After enjoying a 2000 S40 for about 18 months, my DW and I decided more room was a necessity.  We also own a Mazda Tribute which has become the workhorse for the 50 year-old house we are updating.  We could get by with only one wagon-sized vehicle but the S40(while a very nice car) was a touch too small for us.  Enter the V70---A friend owned a 70-series sedan and we thought the interior offered a bit more people room and cargo capacity...but, we wanted even more cargo room and the V70 certainly fills the bill.  While my wife enjoys the higher seating position of the Tribute, we opted for a wagon rather than another SUV-type vehicle.  The Volvo safety reputation was a major factor in our choice of the S40 and the same concerns led us back to another Volvo.  The XC90 was just entering the market and, frankly, it is WAY too much vehicle for our needs.  Our V70 has the 2.4T engine with just under 200 HP(about the same as the Tribute).  I've never needed more power than it supplies(even in Atlanta 'autobahn'-like traffic).  The trim level includes leather, moonroof, high-end stereo with CD, Homelink, power-memory drivers seat and slightly jazzier wheels.  A more basic V70(with less power) and the Cross Country are other models in this series.
     I can't say there are any things I absolutely DISlike about this vehicle.  The steering could offer a touch more feedback and the turbo kicks in at the drop of a feather but these are attributes that would be enjoyed by many drivers.  I would also prefer a stiffer suspension(Volvo offers this option on many models--This V70 is set up more for comfort).  It still takes a bit of work to convert the rear seat to cargo-profile but the fold-down rear head restraints(rather than removable ones) make the switch a little easier compared to the Tribute.  One Tribute feature that I would like to have on the Volvo is the separate rear glass-opening feature rather than the one-piece liftgate.
     The biggest plus for any Volvo is one we hopefully won't enjoy first-hand...the safety features.  This is a 'hidden' benefit much like insurance...you pay for peace of mind even if you don't 'use' the features every day.  The crumple-zones, multi-airbags, side-curtain protection, etc. add to the sticker price but we believe the dollars are well-spent.
     All-in-all, if you can get past the slightly higher sticker price of the Volvos, I believe they offer an excellent level of safety, utility, style and performance.
     I look forward to trading the work-horse Tribute for the new V50 Volvo due to arrive '04.
