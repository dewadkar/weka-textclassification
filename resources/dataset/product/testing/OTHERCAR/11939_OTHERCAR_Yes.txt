  The AGFA 780C is a great little camera! We shopped around trying to make the best choice. The prices can range way up there in the stores.We found this one on the web for $99.00. We decided since the price was cheap, we would try it and see if we wanted to put a lot of money into one. This has been a great camera! The pictures are clear as a bell.The color is great. The images are crystal clear.It is easy to download. Only takes a few minutes.The children have been using this camera on there trips and just little things around the house.They have even taken pictures at night and they are clear.It is still working well after the kids have dropped it and left it laying around. So if you are looking for a camera that will do the job, that the kids can use and will be waiting for you when you need a camera. This is the camera. The only thing that makes me mad is every time I go to use it the batteries are dead.<br><br>
