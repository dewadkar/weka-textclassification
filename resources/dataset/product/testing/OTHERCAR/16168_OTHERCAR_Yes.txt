            Fuji works very well for me � a professional fine artist (classical realism). I was trying to decide between Olympus 2000 and Fuji for a few weeks and finely came up with the list of the features I needed from the camera for my work and family.
I needed a camera for:
a. Shooting compositions for my paintings with &amp; without external strobes
b. Taking pictures from my paintings
c. Taking pictures of my family
Camera should have:
1. Manual mode
2. Macro mode
3. Hot shoe or PC 
4. Optic viewer in addition to LCD
5. Optic zoom
6. Long lasting battery
7. resolution ~ 2 mill pix 
My decision. 
Since computers and digicams are depreciating assets, I always buy them as �MY TODAY�S TOOLS� and not as devices for the �try-it-for-everything-what-you-may-need-tomorrow� lab experiments.
Olympus 2000 and Fuji had almost the same price tags (Nov�99), but Fuji offered free USB card reader ($70), battery charger and something else that I can�t recall now � in total more then $150 of &quot;extras&quot; over Olympus package.
On the other side Olympus optics are made out of real glass, not plastic as Fuji�s.
I did not expect scanner quality images from either camera  (if there is a need for such quality I use my view cam 4�x5� and then scan the transparency).
Knowing that in several months both cameras will be obsolete and I�ll want to buy a better one anyway, I�ve got Fuji from Onvia around Christmas for $698 including everything.
Camera serves well for my purposes.
I don�t care about �slow� start up, �slow� image processing, weak built-in flash (I use externals most of the time anyway) and many other �cons� you'll find in some reviews.
Fuji gives me 80% of good pictures (in compare to 20% when I was using my 35mm Minolta). It became one of my tools and I have many o them.

My advice: 
-don�t buy features that you�ll not use TODAY
-spend saved money to buy Adobe Photoshop ( LE edition will cost you~$95)� this way you�ll be able to correct almost any mediocre image and greatly improve your good ones
-do not expect any camera to be �all-in-one� , even a $20,000 ones
