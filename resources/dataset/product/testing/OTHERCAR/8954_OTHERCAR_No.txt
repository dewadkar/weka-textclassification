            In late 1998, my husband surprised me with a brand new 1999 Breeze (Expresso model).  While the car is exactly what I wanted, and handles well, the minor problem I had turned into a very major ordeal.

I had a leak in the trunk, that we (not the repairmen), finally realized occurred only when I parked the car at a certain position in my driveway.  When I called the dealership, they said &quot;bring it in, we'll re-seal the tail lights&quot;.  First of all, I knew enough to know that the leak was not coming from there, (and I told them so), and secondly, I could not understand how any assessment could be reached without someone first actually looking at my car.  To make a long, ugly story a little shorter, suffice it to say my car went back numerous times, lots of things were resealed, and the carpeting was changed in my trunk. However, the new carpet was simply thrown in there, not at all placed and secured.  My car was returned to me damaged, with extra miles, and with someone else's {music} tape left in my car. The Chrysler &quot;help line&quot; is nothing more than a message service, and my dealership management was equally unresponsive to phone calls and registered letters.  The District Manager was condescending and referred to me as &quot;dear&quot; (and not in a nice tone).  Never mind what it took to get the damage repaired!  (Scratches all over the car! They made it seem like they did me a service in repairing them).  These things began to make me wonder if I would have been treated any differently if I was not a woman.

Months later, and only when I filed a complaint, did they actually LOOK at the car and solve the problem.  And in the end, their lawyer quite smugly said to me &quot;just be sure to park it the right way&quot;.  

So, what exactly is the right way to park a NEW car?

Well, while the car actually has no mechanical malfunctions, is nice looking, plush, and pleasurable to drive, the service I received has turned me off to Chrysler products forever.<br><br>
