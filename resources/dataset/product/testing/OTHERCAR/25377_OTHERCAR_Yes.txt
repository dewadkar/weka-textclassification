            I won the Ephoto CL30 in a contest.. i really enjoy using this camera, its very easy to use and hookup to the pc... it takes great pictures that are easily uploaded and ready to get emailed printed or what have you... the only real thing i disliked about this camera is its use of batteries. this camera goes through the batteries like crazy in one week i went through 4 sets of batteries id say a set of batteries per 15 pictures taken and uploaded... it does not come with the adapter for it and the camera has a special adapter no other one will work with it... but other then the battery problem this is a great camera i absolutely love it.<br><br>
