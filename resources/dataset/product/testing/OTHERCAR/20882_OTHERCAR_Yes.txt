            Chrysler has done it once more.  Adding to the family of its famous head-turners with Prowler and Viper, it now offers an affordable vehicle that is a combo, a mix of car, SUV or sedan-wagon.  For sure, Chrysler is the leader of the pact.  It knows a few things about designing vechicles that speak to the mind of a new generation of car lovers.  This group is part of the hip, cool lifestyle-conscious baby boomers.  What are some of the features of this car?

To help answer this question, I will rely on two young guys who gave me a tour of their vehicle this past week-end.  As soon as the car pulled into the Tower records parking lot, most heads turned towards them.  I was the first one to get out of my Jeep and approach them with a few quick questions.  From where I was at, I expected the driver/occupant/owner to be much older.  They were fairly young.  Until now, I wonder whether they were paid to drive this baby around town.  These guys were more than happy to show me the interior of their car.

When you see this cruiser for the first time, your first impression may be just like mine:  &quot;What a weird vehicle!&quot; you will exclaim.  Still your eyes will be glued to it as you are trying to remember where and when you had seen such a car especially if you are looking at the front end.  For sure, your father and mine will be able to easily recognize the car they used on their romantic sorties in the 1930s.  Chrysler PT Cruiser evokes history, a sense of deep romance of a time long gone.  This Personal Transportation Cruiser can remind of them of their youth, their sense of adventure and virility.  This PT cruiser is designed to meet the needs of both genders.  It is unisex or gender-neutral.

Chrysler PT Cruiser has a lot of space.  I was told that the back seats can be unhooked and rolled out to be benches for a Spring picnic for example.  It has a leaning body style which somewhat reminds me of a Jeep.  It has a large back, which I imagine, can transport practically everything.

This PT Cruiser is for you.  If you are about to turn heads on the street, you want to buy one of these new toys.<br><br>
