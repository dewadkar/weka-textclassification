            Although production of the CRX ended in 1991, no car today can touch its combination of economy and fun.  The fun isn't hard to find -- two seats, strong engines, light weight and a low center of gravity make it a blast to drive.  Because of its wide tires, low gearing and bigger engine, the Si model is the most fun, but the other two definitely hold their own.

On the practical side:

The CRX is a phenomenal city car.  Its small size, great visibility (no blind spots) and ridiculous turning radius make it the easiest car to parallel park in the world.  If the space is still too tight, it's light enough that you and your football playing friend can get out and pick it up.  The slight caveat -- Honda didn't make the CRX with power steering, so you can build up your biceps at the same time.

For commuters, the operative word is involving.  It's not going to cosset you, but its size and acceleration let you fit into the most minute gaps in traffic.

At the same time, though, it's got the power and stability to be a great car for road trips.  Count on getting 35-55 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the model.  Looking up at the top of truck tires on the interstate is also, uh, interesting.  The small size also makes SUVs even more intimidating than usual, and hard to see around.

Despite its small size, it's surprisingly roomy on the inside.  The rear parcel shelf can fold and disassemble, giving you enough space to fit your futon with the hatch open, or a large computer monitor box with it closed.  Plenty of room for lots of luggage.

The CRX is generally really reliable.  It is, after all, a Honda.  The It's also helped by the fact that it's so simple -- there are no power windows, locks, or steering motors to break, and most of them came with stick shifts.

A few things to watch out for if you're buying a used one:
- CV (constant velocity) joints.  They cost ~$300 each
- in northern climes, rust can be a problem.  The most common spot is just behind the rear wheel.
- clutch wear
- The timing belt should be replaced every 60,000 miles, and is an expensive job.
