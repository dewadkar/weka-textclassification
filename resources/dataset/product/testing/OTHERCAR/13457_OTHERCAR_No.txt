               We purchased a 1990 Mercury Topaz last year because it was inexpensive and came with the push button 4 wheel drive option. We were hoping it would be as dependable as our 1986 Topaz had been. That car refused to die until winter 2000, just after passing 250,000 miles. Unfortunately the ï¿½90 was a big disappointment. It immediately needed new ball and U-joints. The next thing to go was the fuel pump. After that was replaced, a safety feature that shuts off the fuel line when your car takes a hard hit (that is, a collision) triggered when we hit a pot hole at 45 mph. The part had to be replaced before the engine could be started again, meaning a tow was in order. Later, a part in the wheel that supposedly CANNOT wear out had to be replaced for about $300. A little further down the road a brake job was needed. Shortly after that, the transmission failed and we were advised to give up. 
   Mechanical defects aside, the Topaz gets extraordinary gas mileage and the all wheel drive feature(which can be problematic), coupled with snow tires, makes winter driving an absolute charm. The interior is nicely laid out but small and cramped. The car handles decently but lacks power. It accelerates from a stop quickly (if you floor it) but doesn't like to be pushed on the highway. 

   Overall our Topaz was a sort of bonfire, onto which money was poured. The more we paid, the more was required. We fixed one problem only to be rewarded with another one. Someday I'll buy a rusted out '86 Topaz and restore it, but if you're considering a newer Topaz...put it out of your head.<br><br>
