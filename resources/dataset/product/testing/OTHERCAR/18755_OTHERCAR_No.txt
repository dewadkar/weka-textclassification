            The VehiCROSS is one of the stranger-looking vehicles you're liable to see on the road (modulo the number of Corbin Sparrows you have in your area).  To say the styling is &quot;aggressive&quot; would be a terrific understatement.  This is one of the cars that you you either love or hate the instant you see it.  _I_ loved it.  A non-scientific poll suggests that I may be in the minority on this (someone suggested that it looked as though it belonged on Mars), but that's neither here nor there.  On the street, this car draws stares and turns heads.  If attention is what you're after, this is a good vehicle.

The first thing you notice getting into the VehiCross is just how high a step it is to get in.  The second thing you notice is just how low the top of the door frame is.  I discovered this with my forehead.  Once you're in, however, the interior is quite roomy and well-appointed, with a cleanly laid-out, if not terribly inspired, dashboard, and very comfortable leather seats.

The view to the front is very good, with a large windshield and ample height above the road.  Visibility to the rear is very much another matter.  The combination of the slit-like rear window as well as the built-in spare tire storage in the rear door make seeing to the rear by any method other than the side mirrors completely impractical.  Changing lanes on a crowded road in this vehicle can be a little scary: there's tons you can't see from the driver's seat.

This lack of visibility extends to the rear seat.  While there are two pairs of windows in the VehiCROSS toward the rear, they're so small and so misplaced that a passenger who wanted to look out to the side either has to lean way forward or recline their seat way back to do so.  The rear seat, while having ample room, is surprisingly dark and claustrophobic.  It's also, given the height of the car, the relative dimensions of the door and the placement of the seats, _extremely_ difficult to get into.  You have to haul yourself up while simultaneously ducking down so as to avoid hitting your head on the door frame.  I cannot see my mom getting into this car.

The VehiCROSS, surprisingly, is only available with an automatic transmission.  It does, however, have a low range and, with its heavy-duty suspension, should perform well off-road.  The transmission is reasonably aggressive, and the car drives and handles nicely.  It's got a slightly top-heavy feeling on the turns, and there's no mistaking the fact that it's a truck rather than a car, but it holds the road capably.

The storage area behind the rear seats is surprisingly small, even when compared with a much smaller car, such as the Toyota RAV/4.  It can be increased a good, deal, however, by folding up the rear seats, which is pretty easy to do.

There are virtually no options available with the VehiCROSS, other than the &quot;Ironman package&quot;, which is not much more than a fairly expensive set of style options.  The standard six-CD in-dash sound system is fairly unique (you feed all six of the CDs, one after another, into the slot in the dash and it stacks them up internally) and has a nice, spacious sound.

Mileage is appalling, which is not surprising, given the V6 engine under the hood.

When I recently purchased a car, I got down to the point where I was dithering between two alternatives, the Isuzu VehiCROSS and the Audi TT.  They both were very interesting to look at, met various criteria I had (although entirely different ones), and had approximately the same sticker price.  I didn't get the VehiCROSS, but I _did_ spend a lot of time dithering about it.  The VehiCROSS without doubt has its merits. If you're looking for a real off-road vehicle with stand-out styling, this is a good choice.  If, however, you haven't fallen in love with the look of the car at first sight, there are other, more compelling choices.
