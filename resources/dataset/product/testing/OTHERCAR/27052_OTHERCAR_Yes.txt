            I bought the Olympus D460Zoom (note the number)and was using it within minutes. The D450Zoom (note the number) had been recommended to me, but when I saw that the excess-little-button problem on that model had been overcome, I decided to get the new one.

I have found that picture quality is great, the slide-cover is handy (but scary -- you keep thinking you're going to smash the lens on its way in but it doesn't happen). Yes, downloading is slow, but not as slow as the one hour film developer who's 1/2 hour away (not really a fair comparison).

I am still working on deciphering the handbook.  Frankly, it needs work.  But you will not need any of the complicated parts to get going and get some great shots onto the net or your website.

Others have written that the image manipulation software is unsophisticated, but it works for me.  I have used the &quot;Instant Fix&quot; with much success, and also the brightness and contrast controls.
In summary -- I'm happy.<br><br>
