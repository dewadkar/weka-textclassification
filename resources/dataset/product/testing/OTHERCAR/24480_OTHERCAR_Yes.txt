            ...So my review is premature, because I haven't driven it more than 5 miles post-purchase yet, so I haven't seen the kinks and haven't had the time to develop any complaints. 

But I can tell you this: I researched this car well (including on this board), and compared it on the road and by the specs to Audi wagons, BMW X3, Infiniti FX35, Honda Pilot, Landrover Discovery, Acura MDX, and Volkswagen Toureg; and to lower priced SUV's like Mazda Tribute (same as Ford Escape, only better), Saturn VUE, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Highlander.

What I found: The Murano handles almost as well (95-98%) as the FX35, gets better gas mileage, has more cargo room, better rear vision, and is a bit softer on the eyes (not quite the beefcake of the FX). It's also at least $5K cheaper, comparing more options on the Murano than the FX. The BMW X3 was a disappointment in looks and size, and is overpriced in my opinion. The Pilot looks pedestrian, and drives that way. Acura MDX is a giant box with ok steering but drives on the softer side. The Toureg is fantastic in almost every category, but has horrible gas mileage because of its weight. It also has the best off-road capabilities of any of these cars, but is too elegant to do all of that anyway. That's a contradiction in value. The Discovery - forget it - a 6,000 pound monster that might as well be a Hummer. The Audi All-road would be a first choice - at about $10K cheaper than it is, or the Toureg, with better gas mileage, slightly lighter, and a couple grand cheaper.

Of the lower priced SUV's, the Honda CR-V is a tin can with a tin can engine with an obnoxious dashboard shift, the Highlander is asleep-at-the-wheel in responsiveness (as is the case with the Escape/Tribute (with an inexplicably retro steering column shift), even though the Tribute is better in my opinion than the Highlander, in both value and handling. While the Tribute and Escape are rated "top-of-class" largely because of their powerful 220 HP V6 engine, they both still feel a little tipsy around a downward sloping curve at 40-50 miles per hour, as in an on-ramp. But here's the BIG surprise for you higher-priced enthusiasts - the best engine comparing to ALL SUV's and at least equal or better steering against other SUV's in its class was the new 2004 AWD Saturn VUE with the Honda 6 cylinder, 250 HP engine. It is a ROCKET, as fast as the FX35 or better, at 1000 pounds lighter than the Murano and 2000 lbs. lighter than many other SUVs. If I get a second car, the Saturn with the 6 cyl. might be it, notwithstanding the cheaper interior, which I will live with at $10K less than the Murano as a knock-around car. I've owned two Honda Accords in past lives, and their engines are impeccable. They simply never break. Change the oil and that's it. Saturn was very smart to buy the Honda's premier engine for this SUV. Trust me, if you want to spend around $24K, you'll have a $35-40K engine experience with the new Saturn. And now it's coming out with sports suspension to boot.

But the Murano is also a rocket. And is well-appointed. And has 81 cubic feet of space with the back seats down  - more than most larger SUV's - and the seats release by two handles from the back, by the back hatch. I'm not going to wax eloquent here about my buying decision...you'll either be intrigued by this car, or you wont. But it does have a great interior with leather, and great handling for its weight. I purchased the SL AWD with everything except the towing, because I have nothing to tow. I'll let you know about the Navigation system in a bit. And the premium sound. And everything else. 

But meanwhile, I'm reveling in my materialistic moment, on the eve of my purchase, because I know about or have driven most of the other SUV's out there. And I was a former BMW 325i convertible driver before this, so I do understand performance vis-a-vis handling capability.

A few notes on money: Believe it or not, the Murano SL has a 3-percentage point higher residual value than the SE after 24, 36, and 48 months, even though the SE is priced around $750 more. To my understanding the residual value (for leases) is set by the manufacturer (for their own lease offerings) and picked up by the Leasing Guide. Now, residual value does not translate equally to purchased cars, but it is an indication of what the industry thinks about the future value of a car. Perhaps it's because 80% of Muranos sold are SL's. The SE was a bit tighter in my test drive, but don't ask me to quantify "a bit". Get my point here? Splitting hairs. And, since some people complain about rattles, stiffer ride equals more rattles. So far, at 5 miles on my car, I haven't heard any. (:-))

I bought black on black. It's a real shame that Nissan doesn't offer a true tan leather, because I may have considered it, but the "Cafï¿½-Latte" leather (oh-so Northern California, where, because of this leather anomaly, I am now embarrassed to say I live here. Well, sorta.)is really just a version of beige with hardly any brown, tan, or brightness to it. So I bought "Charcoal" leather, aka, black. The idea of driving around in a black car with conservative beige in the interior felt too conservative to me. So instead I went Darth Vader...all black. 

I will try to post again about this new baby of mine. If you have any questions specifically about this car please post them and I'll do my best to answer.

My pros: Styling, steering and handling, options-for-price, perhaps gas mileage if it lives up to the 20-24 claim for AWD, which some say is true, others say isn't. I will tell you the truth!!! I also like the CVT transmission and the Nissan engine. The SE also has manual settings for shift speeds, but the whole thing is a bit of a charade, as the CVT transmission upshifts and downshifts as it should in appropriate situations. The "shift speeds" on the manual shift of the SE (which is an optional shifting mechanism in addition to the shifting you normally have)are pre-set to make you think you're driving in "gears", but the CVT transmission has no gear ratios to begin with, so the whole thing is arbitrary. The benefit is that the SE locks in the gear ratio if you want to, until you tell it to shift to something else, kind of like a sports car. Personally, I think the Murano is sporty enough where this added bennie isn't the difference between happiness and despair.

My cons: You cannot use chains on the tires. That's not necessarily a negative, because I haven't researched the alternatives yet. I have AWD and DVC, so I'm hoping this isn't a big issue unless I'm on a pass to Tahoe where chains are required. I'd research this if I were you, more than I have. And please let me know! (I ski!) The back window doesn't open without the hatch, if you're looking for nits. I could care less. To me, it's easier to lift up the whole hatch.
