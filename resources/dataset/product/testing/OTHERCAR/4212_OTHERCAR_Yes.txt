            The Caravan is our second vehicle. We bought it to use to tansport our bicycle (recumbent tandem) which is about 10 feet long. I fits quite nicely with both rear seats removed. This feature was very important to us. We have fitted the factory racks with bicycle-carrying racks and have used them. They function well. There is ample room for luggage in the van even with the bike inside. We also use the Caravan for small family reunions. 

The handeling is good. It is like driving a car (except for the length). I have difficulty judging where the front bumper is (relative to a barrier). It would be better if it could be seen. There is good storage space for maps etc. We have used it for long trips with 2, 3, and 5 people and it comfortable held the people and their luggage. 

The Caravan makes a great family car. It is the clear heir to the station wagon of the 1950s and 1960s and it is much more function than that car.We love it.<br><br>
