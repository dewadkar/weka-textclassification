            A few months ago, I had the chance to drive my aunt's 1999 Suzuki Esteem Wagon. It had about 25,000km (17,000 miles) on it at the time.

I have to admit, this car looks great on the outside. The styling looks like it's right out of Italy! The big "bug eye" headlight provide good illumination as well. The paint is of very high quality, and all body panels fit nice and snug with small gaps between them.

Inside the Esteem, is a very basic, but well fitted dash made of vinyl. The heating controls are of a lever type, and it looks like they are right out of the 80's. Even if the dash is spartan, everything is placed right where you need it. The radio buttons are a little on the small side, and you find yourself having to squint and take your eyes off the road to turn it on or change the channel. The front seats are a bit too firm for true comfort, but you will learn to appreciate them on longer trips. The driving position is fine for taller folks, but shorter people may have trouble because the Esteem doesn't offer a tilt or telescoping adjustable steering wheel. The rear seat is a bit softer and more comfortable. The seat fabric is of extremely high quality, with no evidence of wear whatsoever. Legroom is ample in the front, and slightly cramped in the back. The amount of hatch space is fantastic! We loaded luggage belonging to 4 people into the Esteem for a 4 day trip and all of the folks and their luggage fit into the Esteem with impeccable ease.

When driving the Esteem, you'll like its crisp handling, and smooth ride. This car is a breeze to park. What you'll like a lot less is its rough, noisy 1.8 liter engine. There is a bit of engine noise at lower speeds, which becomes higher than normal at highway speeds. The engine accelerates and decelerates rather roughly. The motor, if noisy and somewhat unrefined, has a bit of pep, but it could use 20 or so extra horses. The 4-speed automatic shifts somewhat smoothly, but things can get kind of rough at higher speeds. The ride is fairly smooth, and most bumps are not a problem for the Esteem's suspension. On rougher roads, the ride slightly deteriorates.

My aunt's Esteem has been to the shop once or twice outside of regular maintenance for minor brake and interior adjustments. Reliability is predicted by consumer guides to be above average and/or very good.


The Esteem is definitely not the best sub compact car on the market. But it is a very capable little automobile, and it won't let you down. It sparks no feeling in you, so don't come expecting loads of personality in this little car. The wagon is a very practical buy, because of its increased cargo space and easy loading. The Esteem is definitely worth a look.
