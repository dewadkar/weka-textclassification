            The 0% interest rate on the loan is what attracted me to the Neon. It was the only new vehicle that I could afford at the time. The repair bills have made up for the initial deal. 
Some of the numerous problems I've encountered include: The engine rattles all the time, people are constantly telling me to check the oil when they hear it idleing. Poor window design creates a lot of wind noise (especially on the highway) and some water leaks. A/C compressor died this spring. The A/C hasn't been fixed because I had to pay $400 for them to tear apart the engine and transmission to replace a seal or gasket that was causing a oil and transmission fluid leak. Three months after I purchased the car a nasty smell began to appear when I turned on the heat or A/C. It turns out the seal around my trunk was leaking and causing the stench. I have had to replace the head gasket which seems to be a constant problem with all Dodge's not just the Neon. (I owned two Daytona's and replaced the head gasket in both) The instrument panel lights have shorted out three times. The mechanic blamed it on my after market stereo and supposedly fixed the problem, but it has happened twice since then. This is a very annoying problem when driving at night. Also the brakes squeak and grind constantly and the steering wheel rattles a lot on the highway.
Other than the mechanical problems I pretty much like the car. I find it roomy enough for 5'7" me and very comfortable for long trips. My brother who is 6'+ has a tough time driving the vehicle and has to sit in the front seat at all times.  For a small car it's roomy. The 4 cylinder engine has good "get up and go" and gets great gas mileage. I'm very glad that I bought a Neon without many options though, it's less stuff that can break!!
