            Although I cannot compare this car with competetors (745i, LS430, XJ) simply because I haven't driven them, the S-class is by far one of the most luxurious car on this planet.

<b>Engine</b>

A V8 4.3 liter 275 horsepower engine may just sound like a average V8. Actually, even the S-430 engine is much torquey. If you really push it and kick the accelerator down, it immediately feels like your driving a sport sedan with 300  horsepower. The V8 engine feels much more powerful than some of the big GM V8 SUVs I've tested. I don't think this should be a concern to anyone.

<b>Performance</b>

I honestly think the performance is excellent. The car doesn't handle at all like a huge heavy sedan. Occasionally I forget I'm in a 4200  lbs sedan. The only cars I've driven that felt more sporty and fast were the BMW M5 and the Ferrari 348 Spyder. But those cars are made for performance. Again, even the ones who don't look performance in a luxury sedan, will be impressed.

<b>Reliability</b>

This is the only small concern I have. There are absolutely no big problems. This is, after all, a Mercedes-Benz. I once I the glove box stuck, and the lock wasn't locked either. I was quite puzzled. Of course, the dealer fixed it without a word. However, a small mechanical problem doesn't doesn't mean there are reliabitlity problems. 

<b>Space</b>

The roomiest sedan I've driven/rode in ever. The rear seats have more leg space than the front. No questions asked.

<b>Comfort</b>

Same here. No questions asked. The best seats in a car ever.

<b>Styling</b>

In my opinion, the looks are great outside, but not best. It's better than the old (1999 and older) S-classes. I sometimes prefer the looks of the 2000-2002 S-classes better, but it doesn't make much difference. Elegant, million dollar styling inside and out.
