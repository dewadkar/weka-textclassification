                  I really enjoy this vehicle because it's very quiet inside, even on the highway. Mercedes usually has good shocks, and the E320 is a perfect example of this. It is a very fast, smooth ride. My friend bought this car with a 5 speed manual transmition, and I enjoy this ride. I have driven it multiple times and I enjoy it because the seats are made of very comfortable leather. There is also a lot of space in both the front in the rear. Even his kids don't complain when they are riding in this car. He bought this car a year old because it cost a lot less. The color of the car is a hunter green and that is the most choosen color in Massachusetts. The stick shift is smooth and it gives that racing feel even for a larger car. The and locks are both power. As for the alarm system it works great except it goes through batteries fairly quickly. I would advise someone without pets to buy this car. Because pets would destroy this interior of the car. The trunk is fairly big for vactioners. The only thing I don't like about this car is the price. This car is comparable to many other cars that cost a lot less. When you buy this car, you really buy the name, not just the quality.<br><br>
