            2 yrs. ago I was looking for a car. I wanted something special, something unusual and something reliable. Three outta four ain't bad. I live in Central Florida so a car dealer was out of the question! I looked for months and finally found a 90' Corrado G-60. After that supercharged was my word of the day, every day. I had to leave the big city and travel into the sticks to drive the car. I met the seller at an out of the way convenient store, at night. I brought a friend who had dealt successfully with a V-dub of the same era. After chugging a can of Natural light the seller agreed to let us have a peak under the hood. My friend checked over, under and around the car and told me that everything was circumspect. We drove the car. The car performed beautifully at the time. No lag from the supercharger, well balanced and semi-fast. Suffice to say, I fell in love. I bought the car right there. Check please!

I drove the car without incident for about 2 weeks. Then the headgasket blew. I got it fixed at a cost of $2700.00!
I had to take a loan out and everything! I got the car back after 2 weeks and found that the idle was off. I fixed that myself. 3 months later I'm driving to work and the temp hits 258, boom the head gasket blows again. This time I decided rather than letting Joe Greaseball fix it that I would do it myself. And while I was at it, I'd fix the Sunroof, radiator,  and anything in between myself.  The upshot to all of this is that there is a cult following of enthusiasts just waiting to help you out with any problems. Also VW puts out a shop manual in print and on CD for this car.

The whole of the operation took about 8 mos to complete.
I took the entire car apart and put it back together better than I found it. I sprayed the interior under the rug with bed-liner material. I put stabilizer and strut bars in. I fixed the sunroof. I put M3 series BMW headlights in. I took all of the VW badges off. I repainted the car black.
Fixed AC. You get the idea.

If you love small sports cars. Have a vague idea of what engine repair is. Have the patience of a Saint. Possess a large array of tools. Want an Audi TT but cannot afford one. Are not afraid of "The Law". Have a lot of time and need a new hobby, or is that obsession. Then this car is for you!

A few trifles of advice for those interested in buying one of these sleds. 
1 - Get a Carfax report, this is very important!
2 - Look at more than one while shopping. 
     (VR6 and G-60)
3 - Take it to a VW dealership for diagnostic inspection,
     (Believe me the seller will understand!)
4 - Make sure the car has not been wrecked or stolen!
     (Mine was wrecked twice and stolen!)
5 - If you buy the car, buy the shop manual!
     (You'll need it!)
6 - Don't be afraid of it! It's just a glorified Microwave!
     (Don't let it push you around)
7 - Breathe Deeply!
8 - Set up a Stock-Market Account for repairs.
     (Big $) (Buy low, Sell High!)
9 - Buy some tools and carry them around in the car.
     (Metric Only)
10 - Carry spare fluids as well.
11 - Check out the online clubs immediately!
12 - Don't sell that IROC just yet! You may need it soon!

All that being said, I'd still highly recommend these cars to anyone! Their a blast to drive! I get lost on purpose all the time, just to drive it! They corner like no other!60 mph on a 90 degree corner! They get GREAT mileage (21 MPG!). They all have sunroofs! They generally all rock without acception!
