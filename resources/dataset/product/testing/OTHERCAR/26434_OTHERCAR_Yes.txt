            I purchased my 2001 Olds Intrigue back in May 2002. This car is a luxury type car that don't cost you a fortune. The inside of the car is very spacious. I have long legs and when I let the seat all the way back my feet just do touch the pedals. The Intrigue handles very well, whether you are riding through the city or on the interstate. It just rides awesome. Just about drive itself, through curves and all. I have to say that when Olds made this car with this V6 motor, they knew what they were doing. The motor in this car is awesome. It has power like an V8. It is just unbelievable. The Olds Intrigue is a nice car to own but the tire end rods and gas mileage can quickly make you change your mind. Since buying my Intrigue in May 2001, I have had to replace the driver and passenger side outer tire end rods. The passenger side went out around 50K miles and the driver went out around 65K miles. This is very unusual for a 2001 vehicle with the amount of miles it have on it. I contacted Olds and the refuse to help. All they did was ran me around the bush. Along with the outer tire end rods, there is some vibration in the steering wheel. You can usually feel the vibration when you are slowing down to make a turn or when you are pulling off and turning the wheel. Gas mileage with this vehicle is not so great. It seems to do a little better when taking trips but as far as driving in the city with a lot of stopping ans starting, this is not the right car. Despite the problems I had with the outer tire end rods, this is a nice and dependable vehicle.
