            I recently purchased my white 2003 Sebring Convertible GTC and have been enjoying it since. I originally had my eye on a Mazda Miata, but being that I'm 6'4" (a big guy) I decided a larger car would be a good idea.

Although the Sebring doesn't have nearly the sporty feel of the Miata, it has ample power to push it's bigger body and give it a muscle car feel.

The Sebring also beats it's sport car counterparts with space. You could never have more than one passenger in a Miata and the trunk is not much more than a large glovebox, but the Sebring has as much room for passengers and luggage as the average car.

My only real complain is that, for some unknown reason, Chrysler failed to put a locking mechanism on the glovebox. This leaves only the center console to hold any valuables while the top is down. Fortunately, a lock can be added. This part costs approximately $80 from the dealer. Labor may vary, but those who are handy may be able to install it themselves.

I have also noticed that seat covers are impossible to find since the seat belt is mounted on the outside edge of the seat. I'm still looking, but it will probably require a custom job. Keep in mind that anyone driving for extended periods of time in the sun should consider using sunblock. Seatcovers can help keep the lotion from getting into your seats.
