            I had the chance to drive a Pontiac Grand Am this past weekend and was fairly impressed. I rented the car from Alamo in San Francisco at the Airport and drove it about 300 miles, touring up Highway 1 and up to Sonoma. Acceleration was great--I had to stand on it a couple of times to get across lanes of traffic and it performed beautifully each time.

Handling on the twisting roadways of Highway 1 was superb with very little body roll even when the road had imperfections that coincided with sharp curves. It was sure-footed, probably aided by the traction control package. The only oddity I noticed was when going down an extremely steep hill, a light came on telling me I was in a poor traction situation.

The automatic light controls were interesting because several times they flashed on going under an underpass, but delayed several seconds when I entered a very long tunnel. It made me wonder where the sensor was and how it was set to trigger.

The front seating was great--snug enough to keep you from sliding around when cornering and adequately padded. Interior lighting was good. Trunk space was large enough for two big suitcases, a backpack, my wife's makeup case, and still enough room for shopping purchases. The back seat might be a problem for a large person to have enough legroom, although it appeared to be okay for short trips. 

Gas mileage was over 20, but I didn't measure it exactly. I'm not trading in my 1978 Mercedes 300D, but I really enjoyed the peppy performance and great handling on this rental car. It made running around the San Francisco area a real pleasure.<br><br>
