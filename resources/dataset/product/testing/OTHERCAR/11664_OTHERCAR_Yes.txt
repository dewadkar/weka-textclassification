            I purchased a Mitsubishi Galant because I needed another family car... not another Dodge Intrepid mind you; I didn't want a huge tank that had cavernous room, but a smaller sedan that could be used for quick jaunts around town. I had never considered foreign made cars before, but once I started looking at Mitsubishi, I was sold. I was... even for a moment... tempted to get an Eclipse, but after test driving it and comparing the room and features of both cars, the Galant definitely was the better deal.

I'm a tall guy, 6'4", so I needed good headspace. The eclipse had very little; I couldn't adjust the seat as much as I could in the Galant. In the Eclipse, my head actually touched the ceiling, but in the Galant I had a good 3-5 inches of clearance, even with about the same inclination and height of the seat. The legroom of the Galant was also more generous, both in front and back. For the testdrive in the Galant, the sales guy, me, my wife, and two kids all piled into the car and took it for a spin. It was quite peppy with all of us in it and very responsive. I drove an ES model first (but now have an LS model -- more on that in a moment). The car had cloth seats which were very comfortable, compared to our Intrepid's seats which offer about the same amount of comfort. The controls in the car were all vey easy for me to reach, and it was obvious that ergonomic planning went into the vehicle. Some cars (cough, ahem, Chevrolets, cough) have no ergonomic planning, but this car had quite a bit. Things like making sure the radio is positioned for easy reach while driving, putting more frquently used buttons near the driver's side. Visibility of the controls was also excellent with high contrast gauges and displays. Visibility out of the car was also above excellent... you can see everythig in ths car without obstruction.

After taking the car for a spin and testing things like the radio, air conditioner, sunroof, idle noise and engine noise during acceleration, I was extrememly pleased. It was an overall very quiet, pleasant ride... one that makes you want to stay in the car. The ausio system of the base model is o.k., but the upgraded Infinity system really shines, allowing you to listen to music at decent voulmes while still allowing you to have a conversation with passengers; GREAT acoustics.

The sales guy also went into some spiel about safety. I nodded and said "Wonderful... I want it." So I went home with the Galant ES. Then....

FIVE DAYS LATER, a car merged into me while I was travelling at highway speeds (55-60), and nudged me into the gravel lane on the side. I lost traction on one side and strated skidding on he other, and the galant flew off the road and rolled end-over-front once then proceeded to roll sideways about three to four times. I thought I was going to DIE. Hearing the metal smashing and feeling the small pellets of glass smash against me think the end was only a fraction of a second away... but the car stopped rolling. I forced the door opened and got out, and I only had a dislocated shoulder and a pretty bad bruise on my left shin. No cuts. ANd I was alive. Looking at the totaled mess that I was standing over made me appreciate safety built into vehicles, especially this one. With the violent rollover force, the cabin was never crushed or even dented inward anywhere. Absolutely amazing. The front and back of the car was disintegrated. But the cabin remained with the front and back windshields shattered, and the sunroof and side windows untouched.

My insurance compnay came to the rescue and paid for everything (woohoo USAA!!). I then upgraded and bought an LS model with ABS and leather interiror. Both absolutely great features that I wanted the first time but didn't get. After making it through the accident, I changed my mind with ABS being absolutely MANDATORY and leather being a nice comfort indulgence. 

Needless to say, I will be staying with the Galant for awhile.. and perhaps the Mitsubishi line in general. I often wonder what my Dodge Intrepid would do in a rollover... I hope I never have to find out, but at least I know the Galant is definitely a safe car. I have over 300 miles on the Galant, and I'll updae my review when I break 1000.

Good luck!
