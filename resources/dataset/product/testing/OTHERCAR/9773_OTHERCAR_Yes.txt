            My dad owns this car and I've driven it quite a number of times.  The only real problem I have with his Rodeo is that when you're shifting to neutral the gears tend to slam into place.  It's almost like the transmission was made to double-clutch into neutral, even though the car is an automatic.  Other than that there's nothing to complain about.  The interior is comfy and attractive, the performance of the vehicle is great considering its size, and the V6 is powerful enough to tow a decent size boat with ease.  The interior towing capacity is also huge, because of the rear seats that fold down to extend the trunk space.
