            I own a 1997 Plymouth Neon and love it.  I bought it brand new. I haven't had to put any major work on it yet and it has 55,000+ miles on it. When looking at new cars I had four things in mind.  1. COMFORT 2. ROOM  3. Overall Price and 4. My monthly payments! It had it all. I was comfortable. It fit who I wanted it to ( and sometimes what I wanted it to).  The overall price was what I could afford and the monthly price was decent enough.  There is an additional plus... I am able to get through snow with out a problem, and in New England THAT COUNTS!!!!  The one thing I DID NOT like! the value of it now compared to what I have paid and still need to pay.  I have paid at least $1000.00 over what it is worth as of about a month ago. That is the only downside. I fit a family of four easily, if you are needing to fit 3 kids and 2 adults you'll be set any more? go larger.<br><br>
