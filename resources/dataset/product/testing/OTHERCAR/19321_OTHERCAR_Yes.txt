            I've owned one of these for about a month now, but I've never actually used it!  My boyfriend is in the US visiting his brother (I live in South Africa), so I bought this camera off the net and had it sent to him there.  He's been taking photos whereever he goes and e-mails them to me

So I can't comment on my personal experience with the camera itself (although I haven't heard any complaints - and this is not someone who reads the manual!).  But I can comment on the quality of the photos, and the practicality of e-mailing and putting the photos on a web page.

First, the quality.  It's amazing :-)  The pictures that I've received are crisp, clear, and sharp.  The colours are excellent (I've tried some webcams, but the colours looked all washed out - not on this camera!), and even indoor photos come out very well with the flash.  And the macro facility lets you take very close up photos without them being all fuzzy.

Secondly, these wonderful quality (and size) photos are tiny, in terms of storage space - they download quickly, whether on the web or via e-mail.

And the camera must be small enough and light enough to carry around with you, seeing as he takes it everywhere he goes!  

You probably get better cameras, but in this sort of price range (and even higher) it's really, really good value for money.<br><br>
