            I bought my '95 del Sol SI new in early 1996.  Since they stopped production on them in 1996? the only way to get one now is to buy it used.

There were three different models produced, the S, the SI, and the Vtec.  The S is pretty weak - if you can't find anything else and you really want one, get it.  The SI is respectable.  If you know how to drive a standard shift, you can have fun with this one.  I never drove the Vtec, but as the SI is fairly sharp, i'm sure the Vtec has some kick.  The SI does 0 to 60 somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 or so seconds.  I've had it at 119 mph near 6700 rpm, it redlines at 7100.

Handling is good.  You're not going to outperform a late model miata so that should give you an idea.  With the top down, the frame of the car gets a little loosey goosey.  The car is pretty light so breaking comes easy on the car.  You'll find in tight turns that the car sticks pretty well to the ground, experienced drivers will notice some body roll if you really push it hard, however.

Top down driving is pretty nice.  The car was aerodynamically designed such that there's very little buffeting with the top off and all three windows down.  You can have a conversation at highway conditions w/o too much trouble.  The back window goes down just as the driver side and passenger windows do.  

Because the hardtop is removable, you'll wonder if it leaks in the rain or not.  I've noticed only the most most minor of leaking on the driver side under the heaviest of downpours - that includes driving home from work when Floyd came up the east coast.  You'll want to get a silcone based lubricant to keep the rubber seals in good shape to make sure it stays leakproof.  Unlike other convertables, there's no softtop for vandals to slash.  However, I lost my keys and broke into my car with a coat hanger on my very first try in under 3 minutes.

Inside the car is pretty nice.  The seats are bucket and the padding is bonded directly to the fabric, they're very thin compared to other car seats.  They're also very comfortable and they really hold you in place on the corners.  The shifter is well placed and the del Sol sits you armchair style when you're driving - excellent.  The clutch has a very short throw.  The AC gets cold in a hurry, the standard stereo/cassette is acceptable.  Two rear mounted speakers in back of your head makes the stereo something you can easily hear top down and 90 mph.  Windows and mirrors are power standard.

The car has a flying buttress style where the frame rises from the trunk to meet the cross support in back of the seats.  This creates a blind spot that will take several hundred miles to get used to.  Make sure you get used to it before you drive in city traffic.

Reliable?  Yep, you better believe it.  115000 miles on it and (knock on wood) no problems.  Changed the oil every 3000 miles, did the timing belt at 85k, and a tune-up at 108000 - all preventative.  Still getting great performance and the gas mileage is right where it was when I got it, 27 to 32 city and highway.

UPDATE:  Spring of 2002 is here and I have 127000 miles on my del Sol.  I think I may have had my first maintenance issue with it this weekend.  During a routine Oil / Filter change the technician found that the clutch master cylinder was nearly empty of fluid.  They topped it off and suggested I bring it in to find the leak in the line.  I hadn't noticed any problems but will take it to the Honda dealer for a check-up.  The biggest expense over the years has been tires - I go through them quickly since I drive the car pretty hard.

Update:  Knock on wood, but I think the 'maintenance' issue with the clutch cylinder and line was a crapload of BS from the GM service department I use for oil changes.  After checking things out myself, I could find no evidence of any leaks and the fluid level has not dropped at all over the last month.  So, I think you can scratch that item from the maintenance issue list and revise it back to "No Problems at 130K miles"  (knock on wood again) I'm glad I didn't shell out the $450 they wanted to 'fix' the problem.



There's a lot of custom stuff out there in the aftermarket, if you're into that sort of thing.

My experience with the del Sol has been nothing short of stellar.  While each of the items above by itself is probably nothing to right home about, all of them combined with the new car sale price of $16,500, I'd say it was a heckuva buy.  If you can find one with under 70,000 miles on it, be confident that, if it was taken care of, you've probably got another 50k to 70k of trouble free miles on it.  It's going to pain me to finally sell this car - maybe i'll just keep it in storage until I have kids and they're old enough to drive...
