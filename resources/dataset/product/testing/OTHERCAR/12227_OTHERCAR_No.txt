            I bought this camera in January '03 and have no regrets. While it does have some shortcomings compared to other digital cameras, it is a low cost alternative.

The advantages of this camera are price, ease of use, AA battery power and memory upgrade capability. Looking at digital cameras, I always liked the idea of not having to deal with film but never liked the high prices. After viewing this reasonably priced camera at K-Mart, and figuring out how to use it within minutes, I decided to give it a try. The viewfinder behind the camera and the menus are very easy to figure out. All that is required is to turn a dial to which ever mode is needed (picture taking, movie making, picture viewing and downloading on to a computer.) and following the menus. My camera came with a 16 mb memory card and is capable of  a number of  image capturing modes. There is a high quality image option which uses more memory and allows less pictures to be taken, and lower quality (less resolution) options, which use less memory, but allow more images to be captured. With my card about 20 to 40 good quality images can be taken in one trip. The camera also has a movie making option, but the extremely small image, without sound, is nothing more than an interesting novelty. The camera's AA battery power is very convenient. Just pop open a little door, put the batteries in, and start taking pictures. Larger memory cards are also available for this camera, all the way up to 256 mbs. That would allow someone to store 100s of high quality images in the camera. Also, the card can be used over and over again. Just download images onto your computer, erase the images, and take more pictures. Switching memory cards is also a snap, literally. Open the door where the battery is inserted, and the memory card is easily snapped in or out.

The camera does have its shortcomings. 3 megapixel cameras are quickly becoming affordable. Some are now  under $200. I barely noticed the zoom option on this camera. I don't even use it because of its insignificant result. I noticed many images are darker than they should be when I put them on my computer to print them out. It is very noticeable when a bright sky is mixed with a shadowy terrain. It does not look right on my computer monitor or on printouts. This is easily fixed with my Adobe Photoshop program, but a problem none the less. Images I've taken indoors and pictures of snow have also come out too dark. I cannot think of one image from this camera that has not needed some sort  color or brightness correction. 

Still, if someone is looking for a digital camera which affordable, easy to use and able to capture alright quality images on vacation or at a party, then this may be the camera for you. If high quality images are important and there is an unwillingness or inability to correct images, look elsewhere.
