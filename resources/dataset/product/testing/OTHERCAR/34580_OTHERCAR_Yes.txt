            This is my third Quattro A4-series car.  A 1.8T, followed by a 2.8, and now an 2.7 TT S4 Avant Tiptronic has convinced me that the platform is the right size and offers the best combination of pace and utility.  Mine was a new leftover 2002 offered at a substantial discount (window sticker was $43,400, clearly overpriced) and the desirable 100,000 "Audi Advantage" warranty as a sweetener.  

The car is an absolute blast to drive.  The performance approaches that of a 3.2 Carrera, while the comfort and accommodations, of course,  far surpass it.  The high-tech traction control, anti-lock, anti-yaw system is remarkable.  Torque is impressive, and the car hammers along at an effortless clip.  Sport seats, full leather, premium stereo, and full amenities make for very comfortable commuting and touring.  The Tiptronic is great in city driving, and, given the right roads, can even be fun to "shift."  While glad to be free of the manual transmission of my old 2.8, the auto-box is not really a replacement for a 5- or 6-speed.

Earlier experiences with Audi have been a mixed bag from a reliability standpoint.  The 1.8T was a problem-child, but the 2.8 was very reliable. This S4, with only 3,500 miles so far, appears to be good.  Minor rattles caused major grief at the dealership, but mechanically it has been problem-free.  Enthusiasm for the dealer network is low, but warranty work does eventually get completed.  

For a "family car" that flies under the radar, the S4 is hard to fault.  Make it an Avant wagon and it just gets better.  The new V8 will be in another world.
