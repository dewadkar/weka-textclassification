            There are two reasons why I purchased my 1997 Nissan King Cab XE 2WD.  First is brand loyalty.  Nissan makes an outstanding product.  Reliability is top notch.  The second reason, this is my second Nissan Pickup, the first being a 1995 Standard Cab.  I was longing for the extra room of an extended cab.  The option list was great for the value.  We're talking cruise control, tilt wheel, CD player, AC, map lights, tachometer, alloy wheels, chrome package, and a rear-sliding window all for under $13K. There is a driver side airbag, pipe style beams in the doors for side impact protection, and rear ABS.  The ride is above par, could use some more road isolation in the steering wheel, and it revs a little high, about 3.5K RPMs at 75 MPH. The four cylinder is adequate at most, will hold it's own up hills at 80 MPH.  Wind noise is high at highway speeds, and I wish they carried over the dual power mirrors as part of the value package (was present in my 1995) instead of the flag type mirrors.  Could also use a larger wheel, like a 15&quot; vs. the standard 14&quot; wheel.  I now have about 56,000 miles on my truck with no major problems (or minor at that).  My next purchase, a Nissan of course!<br><br>
