            The Mercedes Benz E320 has sleek lines that were mastered by the MB engineers in Germany.  While the car comes in the standard colors, the black opal option is by far my favorite.  Although there is an up charge for the metallic paint, it is well worth it.  

Inside the car there are many features that were ingeniously hidden and designed by the MB engineers.  One of my favorite features is the driverï¿½s cup holder that is in the center console.  You press a sliver button on the top of the cup holder, and it expands, rotates and then is ready for use.  The only drawback is that it cannot hold large cups such as any classification of Big Gulp from 7-11.  In general, MB has made the departure from the European standard and cup holders do abound in the car, which can be an important feature.  If you are looking to purchase a MB, you should definitely consider the rain and snow package, about $750 extra.  With this package you get headlight washers and several other features, however, the most important is the heated seats.  If you live in a cool weather climate, the heated seats can be one of the most important features that you will ever use.  In general, the interior of the car is very comfortable.

In reality, this is a sports car in a sedan chasse.  This car can move.  There really is no need to purchase the E420.  We drive our E320 back and forth from Denver, CO to Vail, CO, which is a trip that many cars struggle to make, and the E320 does it with ease.  The only reason to get the E420 is to say that you have one.

MB has been a pioneer in safety features.  The E320 has a front-end crumple zone and reinforced side doors.  Additionally, as with most MB products build recently the E320 has several anti-slip / skid control devices.  The E320 also has front and side airbags.  It is also equipped with five, three point seatbelt.

If you are looking to make your car a little sportier you should look at an AMG model.  AMG is partnered with MB to make various alterations to the vehicle and make the already sporty sedan into a speed machine.

I love my E320 and I am sure that anybody else would love one two.  However, depending on the options chosen, the price tag can approach $47,000, which can be steep for some, but well worth it.
