            After many years of 35mm cameras, both manual and auto-everything versions, we finally moved into the digital world.  After plenty of research on the web, we decided on Canon's G3.  Perhaps a bit pricey for some, considering this is a 4 megapixel camera, but don't let that keep you from strongly considering the G3.  Although a frequent PC user, I wasn't really looking for anything that was a technical challenge to operate.  Fear not.  You can be shooting pictures in minutes (by reading the "quick start" guide"), and save the larger manual for when you have more time and some familiarity with using the camera.  

The camera is comfortable to use through the viewfinder, which I do most often out of habit.  A bit more of the image is stored than is visible in the viewfinder, but it's not objectionable in any fashion.  This can always be cropped, if you get more than you bargained for.  The camera is lightweight, compared to our 35mm cameras (Pentax and Minolta), and is nicely molded to fit comfortably in your hand.

The battery life is very, very good, which was a pleasant surprise.  You'll use a proprietary rechargeable battery from Canon.  Although I bought an extra battery, which I'd still recommend you have on hand, I've not had to use it yet.  The charge is quick, no more than 2 or 2 1/2 hours, from a complete battery drain.

Images are, in a word, stunning to me.  Objects in focus are extremely sharp and impressive.  We've enlarged one shot to an 11x14 already, with no noticeable deterioration in image quality.  It's being matted and framed for our house.

The macro setting can be accessed with the click of one button.  For these, it's suggested you use the LCD screen to assist with focusing.  We did some close-up flower shots that showed extraordinary detail in the petals; even took pictures of a large bumble bee that was buzzing nearby.  
Although he looked like a Volkswagen with wings, the clarity was very satisfying.

Downloading images to a PC is quick (probably no more than a minute or so with 50 to 60 images), and the software that comes with the camera requires virtually no ramp-up to fully utilize the tools.

We bought the camera 2 months ago, and I've been meaning to "pay back" to this site and others, that provided me with product insight during my research.  Simply stated, the G3 gets high marks for being a high-quality, customer-friendly product.  There is one problem, though.  Once you buy one, your old film cameras are going straight to the box in the closet, where mine are now permanently stored.  

Ya just gotta love progress, eh?  Best wishes,
