            We needed a new car. Badly. So we looked around and found this car to be the most comfortable and the most reliable. Also some style was there. So we took it home-oh what joyous ride. The bucket seats are comfortable, it has a sound system (5-cd player in the back) worthy of this cars look, and it ain't the slowest thing out there (even though it's not the fastest, It's all I need). We've had it for some time now and this review will give why you should/shouldn't but this car.

<b><i>My</i> 2000 Mercury Cougar</b>
My Cougar is a 2000, automatic with just over 20,000 kilometers on it. We do a lot of in town driving with it but every once in a while we go for a seven hour drive, so it's not all city mileage. It's an automatic and the color is citrus gold-no don't be saying gold is the tackiest color because our gold is good because it isn't the sparkly kind of gold that leaves you saying &quot;eww, that's a messed up color&quot;. We like it.

<b>Performance</b>
This car has not been to the shop yet and probably wont for a long time. It's still running great and smoothly. This car is nice this way because it is a real smooth ride (you can't feel the bumps), there is no road noise (the car blocks it all), and it's nice to drive. The steering is great, easy to handle and control. The gas and breaks have always worked good. In fact the only bad thing about driving is that it's a low car and we have barely cleared a few barriers in parking lots, but if you're carful you'll be fine.

<b>Comfort</b>
Ahh, I could sit in this car forever. The front seats are slightly bucketed and very adjustable, they're are only 2 back seats, but the reason is that they are bigger and very comfortable, each one is it's own seat, they're bucketed and when the come up on the inside of each seat it meats with an arm rest (one for each seat) and a cup-holder. The air conditioning works good, and it doesn't smell like some cars. And even though the back seat window doesn't roll down, the front seat window is rather large so even opening it half way is is enough for both.

<b>Sound System</b>
The sound system in this car is very good. It is crisp and clear, and also easy to work the CD player. Very easy, even for the 5 holder. The panels are very understandable and you will be going with it right away. And it's got some good volume, oh yeah.

<b>Trunks Space</b>
When you first see this car you may be turned off by what <i>looks</i> like a small trunk. In fact the trunk goes a <b>lot</b> further than the hood suggests. Also both back seats flip back so that you can get at the back at all times.

<b>Safety Features</b>
The Vehicle has a lot of safety features. First of it has good working, comfortable seat belts. But that should be mandatory. This car has few new things. It has a feature so that if you get in a car accident it shuts off the fuel line so it wont feed the blaze. There also is a button to reset it if you need to continue driving, if say it was just a little bump from another car. 

This car has a few nice anti-theft devices like and alarm, but also the key has a microchip in it so that no other key (but the two you are given) will work. But you can get more made by either a qualified locksmith or the dealership. Also a piece on the stereo faceplate can be removed which will make the stereo system un-usable if someone wishes to steal. And on the piece the is a little clip so it will fit anywhere and not get lost.

<b>Overall</b>
Overall this is a great city car that will get looks from other rivers, while giving you a nice ride. Also it is good for long trip, being a very reliable car. And you can always keep the tunes cranked! A recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
