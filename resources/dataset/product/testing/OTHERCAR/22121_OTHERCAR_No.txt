            This was my first digital camera and I'm not impressed.  It takes great pictures inside - very high quality, good color.  Outside is a very different story however - nothing is crisp, even in bright sunlight.

The camera seems well made until you look at the battery compartment, which is made of cheap plastic which is just begging to be snapped.

The user interface is excellent - it's very easy to use.  It's not that bad on batteries if you don't have the LCD on all the time - I can get 2 to 3 rolls of 12 shots each before I have to recharge my rechargables.

I would recommend this camera highly for someone who wants to take party shots, baby pictures, etc.  I would not recommend it for anyone who wants to use it outside.

I have lots of sample pictures taken with this camera on my website at http://www.ianandwendy.com/OurNewHome/OurNewHouse.htm

Check out the panoramic shot - I put it together very easily and without a tripod.

I have posted pictures comparing it to the Olympus 360L. Check the page

for a good idea of what I mean by &quot;terrible outside&quot;.

I also suspect I might have gotten a lemon when I bought this camera, since the Olympus 360L was so much better.
