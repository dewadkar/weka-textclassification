            We owned a 1993 Park Avenue Ultra and loved it.  It was one of the best driving cars we have ever owned (and I've owned many).  Very responsive when you put your foot on the gas.  Handles corners like a sports car (the front wheel drive helps).  The interior is awesome and luxurious (my daughter said it in one word...cool).  The engine is very quiet and low maintenance.  We owned it for many years and only had one major problem (the alternator needed to be replaced after 110,000 miles).  You will like the firm and responsive feel on the expressway and in tight situations.  The trunk is quite roomy for a midsize car.  The controls are very logically located and easy to use.  The car's sound system is pretty good considering it's a factory stock issue. 

After many years of enjoying and trusting this car,  we finally sold it to a relative who loves it.  He was looking for a new car and after 9 months of ownership,  he is hesitant about letting it go.  You will find it difficult to match this vehicle's quality and ride in today's market.  

I would strongly recommend purchasing this vehicle to anyone who wants a luxurious, reliable,  and solid car.
