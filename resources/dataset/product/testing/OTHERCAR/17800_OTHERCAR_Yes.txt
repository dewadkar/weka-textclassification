            I bought this car new in 1991.  The car was the best in its class at the time, more powerful and better looking than the Celica and Eclipse of those years.  I went for this car because it had rear wheel drive, and we wound up with the coupe because it was better looking, and less expensive than the hatchback.  In SE trim, it was nicely equipped for $16k, with alloy wheels and power windows.  The 2.4 liter DOHC engine made 155 hp.  The engine had ample power from idle to 4000 rpm.  From there, things get a little rough and the revs build slowly.  On the highway, the car gets a little noisy past 75mph, thanks to gearing that was better suited in the days of 55.  

Light enough to make good use of all the power it has, the 240SX can be fun to drive.  I've replaced the front brakes with a stillen cross drilled kit, and the air filter is K&amp;N.  The spark plugs were changed to Bosch Platinum.  Each mod adds a little power, probably more in the mind than in reality.  Everytime it rains, you can play race car driver and drift the tail out just a bit.  Go ahead, it's real easy to control with countersteer.  Pirelli P6000SV give this car good grip without feeling noisy or stiff.    

Something Nissan is really bad at is giving drivers a good seat.  The fabric has held up well, but the seat is uncomfortable and lacks support for real aggressive driving, giving you the worst of both worlds. I'm also too tall for this car, and unless it's laid way back, I feel claustrophobic.  I'm only 5'11, by the way.   

Paint has held up really well, except for the spot that was left by some punk with an egg.  After nearly 10 years on the coast, I have yet to spot any signs of rust on the car.  A surprise considering that we had to have this car pulled out from the wet in the flooded streets of Houston.  

This car has been just super in terms of reliability.  The AC needed a new hose at 65k, and the odometer is now working off and on.  The digital speedometer is now flickering occasionally. This speedo has a nice feature in that it has a 'head up display' that appears on the driver side windshield, letting you see how fast you're traveling without taking your eyes off the road.  

For 5 years, this was our primary transportation.  When the in laws visited, things were kind of tight, because the small trunk will only carry one suitcase.  The poor folks had to sandwich a suitcase between them in the already cramped back seat.  I drive with my seat all the way back, or I get cramps.  I wonder why they insisted on getting their own rental car.  When we bought a computer, my wife had to give up the front seat to the monitor so we could take everything home. OK, we could have bought an Accord, but it wouldn't have been nearly as much fun.  

This is a great car for someone who's single and knows somebody with a bigger car when they need it.  Definitely a short distance commuter.  And someone who hasn't forgotten what it's like to have the rear end of the car do the pushing. Definitely a car that does what its designed for well but has its limitations.<br><br>
