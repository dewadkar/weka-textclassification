            I've just got hold of this cute little digital camera - actually it's an unwrapped Christmas Present that I found stuffed in the back of a drawer this morning (on my annual hunt out the &quot;Hidden Christmas Presents&quot; trek) and hopefully it's intended for me!

I have had no problems loading the software that enables you to upload the photo's taken and to save them onto the hard-drive/diskette. Hooking the camera up to the PC was so simple and so was uploading all the wonderful photo's I've taken so far. The only problem I have now is how to hide all these photo's stored on my PC, until after Christmas day.

The dogs and my friends are all in hiding right now as they have had their full of me pouncing out at them or trying to get them to sit still long enough for me to get that perfect shot!

This camera is very &quot;user-friendly&quot; and I recommend it to anyone seeking out their first digital camera.

The only downside that I can find is that the camera hasn't come with a power pack supply (needless to say, one can probably be purchased) and I've gone through heaps of AA Batteries during the uploading and photograph process.

Another positive with this camera is if you haven't got the perfect shot the first time around you can view and erase the not so perfect ones at a touch of a button and then try again.

This would make a perfect Christmas gift for any computer junkie who has just about every other PC gadget available!

Back in the box you go!
