            I got a 9-3 S convertible in October of 1998.  It is silver/with a black interior.  I really like how the car looks from the outside, it is definitely European and unlike other cars you see on the road.  It especially looks great when the top is down.  When the top is up, as it often is in San Francisco where I live, I think it looks somewhat funky and is an acquired taste.

The Good: It takes a second or 2 once you start driving for the turbo to kick in, it can give you a jolt.  Absolutely excellent on the highway.  In the city, the start and stops hinder the ability to really get into the use and feel of the turbo engine.

Another good quality, the leather seats and interior is basic with not 2 many lights or gadgets to deal with.  On the steering wheel you can change the radio stations, volume, and number of the title playing on the cd changer.  The sound system to me is just adequate, it is not quite enough when driving with the top down on a highway.

The seat warmers are a great plus.

The Bad: I had a clutch problem early on with my 9-3.  It would smoke and have this terrible smell.  The smell would linger for a day.  I took it into the shop, they said they checked it and nothing was wrong, and I have had no problems since.  Very peculiar.  I have read from other opinions that this clutch problem has happened with others.

Sight lines when the top is up.  Seeing out the back window is hard because it is a small window.  You really learn how to use tour mirrors with this car.  Also, inside the vehicle, seeing certain instruments on the panel can be difficult as the steering wheel and the turn signal and wiper levers block certain things.  It is really odd, I have never had a car that blocked certain things on the panel that that the Saab does.  I have not gotten used to it either.

Another bad, my local dealer has had about 4 different Saab Service Managers in the past 13 months.  One has been great, the other seemed clueless.  Be real careful to see who is in charge of the service department and how long he has been with the Saab team.

The Ugly: All the above being said, it is hard for me to say that the Saab 9-3 S Convertible is worth the money (about $445 a month, including taxes, a 39 month lease).  I have to tell you, after my lease is up, I'm not keeping the 9-3.
