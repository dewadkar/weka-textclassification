            The Daimler-Chrysler line of mini-vans, have since their inception in
1984, been the standard by which all other mini-vans have been judged.
As the innovators of the body style and configuration, Chrysler led the
field into the &quot;mini-van era&quot; which continues strong to this day. Most
everything about the Chrysler line of mini-vans has been copied by other
manufacturers around the world.
Since the 1988 model year, I have owned 3 Plymouth Grand Voyagers, and,
the latest, a 1998 Town and Country. With the exception of a manufacturing
problem with the 1991 model, which the company promptly fixed, I have had
little or no problems. 
Friends who have ridden in or driven my T&amp;C have all commented on the
comfort, ride, and car-like driving characteristics. These people are
owners of such makes as Cadillac, Lexus, and BMW 750IL. Long trips are
pleasantly non-tiring.
No automobile has ever been made which did not have something that owners could complain about, however minor. The T&amp;C is no different. Some 
decisions by designers, particularly those designing the interior, defy
explanation. You would think a car of this price category would have a
decent driver/passenger doors assist pull strap or handle. Nope, just a
very shallow finger pull which is very difficult for old, arthritic
fingers. A nice accessory pouch is provided on the back of the front
passenger seat in easy reach of the driver. So, why not one on the back of the driver's seat so items could be carried in reach of the front passenger? A nagging problem found on the '98 model not found on earlier
ones is that in damp weather, a fog develops on the outside of the
windshield requiring intermittent operation of the wipers. This is 
evidently caused by heat venting directly from the engine compartment onto the cold windshield. You would think this would be helpful in winter with
icy windshields, but that doesn't appear to be the case. I can live with it though.<br><br>
