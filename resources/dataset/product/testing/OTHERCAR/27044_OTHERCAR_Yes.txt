            This camera takes great photos, but the user interface is really bad. You have to use it regularly or you will forget how. For example, the menus use icons where there is plenty of space for text. It's hard to figure out what the icons mean. A picture of a hammer inside a box: what does that mean? Select it to find out. Oh, it means format the memory card! Why should a camera user have to worry about formatting a memory card? How is this different from the &quot;erase all photos&quot; function? I could go on and on about the problems with the UI, but the bottom line is this: I recommend this camera only for techies. 

Nice features include the high quality of the photos, and the NTSC output for showing photos on a TV. Also, buy a couple sets of 1500 mAh nickel-metal hydride batteries. I am able to take more than 150 photos with these batteries, use the flash once in a while and the LCD once in a while.

One more thing to note: there can be quite a delay from the time you press the button until the photo is actually taken. And it takes a long time for the LCD to turn on once you press the button. <br><br>
