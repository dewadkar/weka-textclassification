            My overall opinion of the Saturn SC1 is great.  I am currently driving my second saturn.  I truly enjoy this car.

My first Saturn was bought for me by my father.  As well as the second, we really loved the safety features.
I love the cars excellent gas mileage, and reliability.  My main problem with the car is its size.  The saturn is very small, and even though it has seats for four, don't plan on that many people riding in the car.  The back seat is extremely small.

This vehicle is great for a first car, wonderful for young drivers.  However this car is not so great for a family.<br><br>
