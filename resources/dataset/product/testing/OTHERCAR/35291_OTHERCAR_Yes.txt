            My husband bought me this car because he got a very good deal on it.  He works for a used car salesman and rebuilds cars that are totaled.  The Corsica  we bought was rebuilt but not totaled.  Another reason why he bought me this car is because I have wanted a Corsica since high school driver's education class.  We had a 1993 and I fell in love with the model then. 

There are many things that I like about this car.  The ride is very smooth and comfortable and the trunk is very spacious.  Gas mileage is also a plus, with the gas prices going up hourly, or so it seems, I wanted a car that at least had decent gas mileage.  This car gets 27 miles in town and 35 miles on the highway.  Which is very good because I am not always having to stop and get gas.  I fill it up no more than once a week.  The care accelerates very quickly, much to my surprise because it is a 6 cylinder.  Other features that I like about the car are the anti-lock brakes, driver's side airbag, tilt wheel, cruise control, and power windows.  The back seat is also very spacious, two carseats fit in the back and there is still plenty of room for another person.  I also like the way the back seat folds down for extra trunk room.  I hardly ever get to use this because I always have my children with me, but it has come in handy a few times.

Like I said before this car drives very smooth and makes the trip seem like it takes less time.  My husband's family lives in New York so this is very important because we live in Alabama and drive to visit them at least once a year.  We never feel cramped which is a major plus with two toddlers in the car.

I recommend this car to  anyone. I think that it is very durable and will stand the test of time.  This care would be really good as a first car for a teenager or a first family car because of the price and durability.<br><br>
