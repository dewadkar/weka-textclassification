            The first major purchase I ever made was my 1992 Grand Am. If you're driving a metallic blue '92 coupe that you just picked up used- be nice to it. 

<b>Driving it</b>
Mine was a Grand AM Se, with a V6 and leather sport package. Having driven the rental Grand AM's without the leather package, it adds a lot to the driving experience. The V6 is simply mandatory to a enjoyable driving experience. I never had a problem with hill climbing or acceleration off a ramp. It was also helpful in the New England snow. The additional power is immediately noticeable in a car this light. It's also very maneuverable. At 21, with a new fast car and a buddy on a completely deserted highway we went..... entirely too fast, as the State Trooper was only too happy to point out. You don't want to drive the maximum speed this car will go. Ever. Not because there is anything wrong with it, only because the speeding ticket will cost you several monthly payments. I do very highly recommend the V6. It is actually less noisy than the smaller engines, because it doesn't hit the higher RPM that the V4 does to get the same acceleration. The rental Grand AM's were far noisier by comparison. 

<b>Human considerations</b>
They look good. Real good. Even after three years the car still got compliments. At seven, the car still looked fine. Appearance has never been one of the Grand AM's shortcomings. The four-position front seat was comfortable enough for me, and I'm a fairly large guy. The cloth cover stood up to the normal wear and tear just fine. The back seat was cramped especially on long trips. All the knobs for the radio and the climate control were easy to understand and to get to. It was and is a great car for someone in their 20's, or as a get-to-work commuter car. 

<b>Shortcomings</b>
The biggest shortcoming with Pontiacs are their dealers. From buying the car to getting it serviced, the best way to deal with them is; as little as possible. The saleswomen told me about several incentive programs that I was eligible for that didn't exist or had expired when I tried to use them. I was put through the standard &quot;What do I have to do to get you to buy this today&quot; song and dance. Getting appointments was a nightmare. &quot;You want your oil changed? Well, drop the car off at 7AM and we'll have it ready by 5.&quot; Virtually every experience was a bad one. The dealership did repaint the car under warranty because the paint chipped, but they made that a miserable experience because they locked the repainted car in a garage over the next weekend. (I screamed myself hoarse over that one but nobody could/would do anything.)
As far as the car was concerned, during the first five years I owned it, I replaced the water pump once ($147), One battery ($67), -because I left the lights on a few times... two brake jobs (@$200) and that's about it. After five years it did have a problem with the drivers side footwell leaking occasionally. Once it passed 105K miles it had some electrical problems, and wear and tear issues started to get worse. When I traded it in after 7.5 years and 115K, the powertrain and transmission never once had a major issue and the car had no rust to speak of.  

Pontiac; good cars, lousy dealers.
