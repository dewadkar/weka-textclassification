            This is truly an outstanding camera to use. It's simple enough to grasp almost immediately and is lightweight enough to also easily carry around at anytime. I love pretty much everything about this camera and have been nothing short of impressed with since I started using it. I have two HP digital cameras besides the Kodak and had never considered Kodak before this one. I had heard where they were too proprietary, which didn't thrill me too much at all. What a surprise to find out they aren't! The software does an excellent job handling the downloading of pictures to the computer from the camera dock that also doubles as a battery charger. Just push the button on the end of the dock and the software practically holds your hand through the rest of the downloading. One time I took the secure digital card from my HP 720 and put it in the Kodak, and to my surprise the Kodak recognized pictures already taken with the HP. The more I use this camera the more I like it and seem to discover more hidden features about it every time. The shutter speed delay is nice with this camera. Once you understand what the button markings mean and how it all works it's a snap to use and to review pictures already taken. The movie function is easy to use and works extremely well. It appears to be durable with the metal case. So many newer cameras are all plastic, which makes them look cheap. The Kodak is rugged looking and a very nice looking camera. I have to disagree some with other reviewers that complained about not enough internal storage and don't consider that a valid complaint since that's why the secure digital cards are to be used. When you fill it up pop in another and the way you go. I have used the camera quite a bit and have yet to wear the battery down, so I would say battery life looks as if it could be pretty good. I read one reviewer's comments on the software. While not exactly Photoshop it does a nice job at touching pictures up and adding some "fun effects" without the steep learning curve associated with higher end products like Photoshop. Anyone, and I do mean ANYONE, can easily master the software in no time flat. Overall I can't find enough good words to say about the Kodak LS443. Whether you're a newbie to digital cameras or experienced this is one I HIGHLY recommend for everyone!
