            Dodge has hit the minvan jackpot with this line of family vehicles.  This is my third consecutive car and I plan on purchasing another next year.  I have a pretty large family, including pets.  With seven spacious seats, there is plenty of room for any large family or people.

This car has been durable to say the least.  The only problem that I have encountered deals with the in dash CD player.  The dealership is who I put the majority of the blame on however.  

The Plymouth Voyager is basically the same car I believe, just made by a different manufacturer, such as Chevy vs. GMC.  In comparing the two for purchase, I would go with the cheaper one, since as I mentioned before, they the virtually identical.  The two rear sliding doors are ingenious.  It makes access to the rear seats easy.  The two middle bucket seats can be taken out with relative ease as well as the back seat.  With these out, you can haul more than the bed of a pick up truck can.

I would strongly recommend this minivan to those with a large family that need a large vehicle to haul anything, even the kids will like it.<br><br>
