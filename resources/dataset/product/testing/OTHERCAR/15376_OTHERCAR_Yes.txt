            What a GREAT product this camera is!  Ingenious Sony has done it again with high resolution, superior features, and best of all, CHEAP STORAGE!  You really can't go wrong with any member of the Mavica line, it just depends on how much you want to pay and how tight you want your resolution.

My preference was the upper mid-range Mavica FD83, with 6x Optical Zoom, 4x speed Floppy Drive, Voice Memo and MPEG Movie modes, and 1216 x 912 SXGA resolution.  I waited MONTHS to get one of these and although I was frustrated by the extreme delay (ordered in June, received in December!), all my anger dissipated the minute I took my first picture.  All I can say is WOW!

Applicable for any situation including eBay, far-flung friends and family, and professional situations, this camera has an innumerable amount of uses.  From retailers to realtors alike, all say the same thing...instant cost savings due to no development or scanning costs, and better than that, instant photos that can not only be used on the spot, but given away on the spot as well, thanks to the super easy, super CHEAP floppy storage!  Talk about instant gratification!<br><br>
