            Picked my Silver with red interior up off the floor of the dealership two weeks ago. No question, it is a hot little car, everyone wants to know what it is! Problems, nothing major, but guess what? No clock, can you beat that? No ash tray either! Oh well you can't have everything, can you? I wanted the exhaust to sound a little better. My local dealer told me that there is an all stainless steel exhaust that can be had, along with a cooler for the motor,the package will increase the HP by about 25%, total cost for this little extra $3,995.00 plus tax, installed! I do have a complaint about the CD player, the suspension is so stiff, that every time you hit the smallest bump, the CD skips, I guess there must be small problems with everything. Some minor rattles, which I think the first service should handle. Other than these little &quot;problems&quot; the car is just  GREAT!<br><br>
