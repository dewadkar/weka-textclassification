            My Daughter just bought a new Millenium silver 2000 4Runner SR5 V6. It's beautiful!. I love the way it looks. I can't take my eyes off it.
The 4Runner has great handling characteristics. It turns on a dime. Brakes are good. It's V6 engine is peppy and responsive. The interior is very functional, just like all Toyotas. 
I own a 1998 GMC Jimmy. The 4Runner has a rougher ride than the Jimmy, which is to be expected, since the 4Runner sits higher and has much bigger tires. The 4Runner runs very quiet. The doors of the 4Runner don't sound solid when you slam them. They feel light and don't have a solid feel or sound.
Forget about changing your own oil/filter. Unless you are a mechanic, it'll be a very difficult job.
I would buy a 4Runner. It's a great 4x4, if you're not looking for an ultra smooth ride (which should be the case, since this IS a 4x4). Toyota quality is evident throughout. 
ADDENDUM: After numerous problems with my Jimmy, I decided to &quot;bite the bullet&quot;. I sold the Jimmy to a GMC dealer and bought my own 4Runner. Forget the Jimmy. It's got fuel injector problems. The 4Runner is the 4x4 to own.<br><br>
