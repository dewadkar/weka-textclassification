            This review is on the RCA CDS6300 Digital Camera. This was my second digital RCA camera I purchased, the first one being a complete disappointment and was returned immediately. The whole thing started on a Sunday morning while looking through the OfficeMax flyer. On their front page they had this camera offered for $199, that�s $200 off the original price. What a deal I thought. So I quickly called to see if they had it in stock. After finally calling a few stores, I found one that had it in stock. I immediately ran out and bought one. After getting home and opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the camera seemed to have a nice sturdy feel. I noticed some digital cameras seemed to have a �cheap feel� to it; this one didn�t suffer from that problem. The package included USB and Serial connections, a TV Hook up, Software, Manual, Case, Neck strap, and an AC Adapter.

This camera seemed like such a great deal for the price I paid. When first using it, I liked a lot of the features this camera had. It seemed to be laid out very nicely, and looked simple to use. It even had a cool shutter noise when you took pictures, but there�s really no point in it. After taking a few pictures, I used the TV Hook up to instantly look at how they looked. I was very impressed. I then proceeded to install all the necessary software to use the camera with my computer. It took a while for it to finally work. After the first install, it couldn�t detect the camera. So I rebooted, and re-installed everything. The second time around, everything worked fine.

Now I am finally able to take some pictures and view them on my computer, and really get an idea on how this camera performs. The first thing I noticed was how fast the pictures were uploaded to the computer. I was very happy with the upload time. Ok, so I got the pictures on my computer now, and it�s time to take a close look at the overall quality. I thought the picture quality was amazing, and you couldn�t get anything better for the price I paid� That is, until I got a different camera. (More on this later) And for some reason the camera�s LCD would flicker a bit while taking pictures, probably from the batteries being drained a bit from the camera�s flash. Also, the LCD seemed pretty dim and dull. And if you plan on using your camera more then 2 minutes with batteries, keep the LCD OFF! Pretty much all Digital Cameras suffer from poor battery life.

Now for the greatest part of the review, all the problems I encountered with this camera. First off, within the same day of buying the camera, it locked up. The LCD screen turned a dark gray, with a single line going through it. At this point, NOTHING worked on the camera, you couldn�t even turn it off if you wanted to. The only way to turn off the camera was to remove the batteries. This happened to me twice. Luckily the camera still worked after this happening twice, but then more problems just occur. From the camera not being able to detect the battery power properly, to the flash not working. The camera would say I had full battery power on the display, even a second before it completely dies. And one point the flash just completely stopped functioning, and worked only when plugged into the AC Adapter. Despite all this, I kept the camera. That is, until the display on the top of the camera started flashing and displaying a �7� in the lower right hand corner. 10 Minutes later I found myself back at the store trying to get a refund; instead I walked away with a different camera.

The camera I ended up getting was a Kodak DC3400. OfficeMax offered to give me this camera in exchange of the RCA one I had since they were all out of stock. I gladly took it. The quality difference in this camera is huge, and the pictures are much sharper, clearer, and overall better looking. I have yet to have a problem with the camera. The LCD is also much better; it�s a lot sharper and has much better color and brightness. I highly recommend this camera, and look for a review on it by me sometime soon.

All the major problems I encountered with this camera aside, it was a relatively ok camera. It was simple to use, took average quality pictures, and seemed pretty cheap. But for the price you�ll pay, you can find a much better quality product elsewhere. I do not recommend ANY RCA Digital Camera to anyone. After buying two and disliking both, you can do much better then this, or any RCA camera.
