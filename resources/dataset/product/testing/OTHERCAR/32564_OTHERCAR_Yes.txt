            I've owned my Saturn SL2 for almost four years now. It has been a great car, and I highly recommend it.

Favorable considerations:
* Excellent purchasing situation; no high-pressure sales
* Cheap to maintain (we should have bought the 60k maintenance package, but even without that, cost of ownership has been low)
* Durable. The flex panels absorb punishment and still look great. The interior cleans well. No parts of the interior have broken off or gotten junky. Doors close cleanly. I hate cars that start to deteriorate after 50k miles. The Saturn doesn't.
* Surprisingly flexible. Putting the back seat down allows us to haul plywood, bikes, gardening equipment, and so forth. Not a truck, but a great plus for a little sedan!
* Cheap to insure. Excellent premiums; Saturns are quick and cheap to repair, and have great safety stats, so insurance (which is a significant part of the cost of ownership of a car) is cheap.
* Great feel. The car drives very tightly, even after tens of thousands of miles.
* Comfortable on long trips.
* Roomy. I'm quite tall, and the Saturn was one of the few smaller sedans that I could fit in.
* Excellent service at dealership. Fast repairs/service, pick-up and drop-off, etc.
* Looks great! With the alloy wheels and spoiler, looks fantastic. Not as nice as the SC2s, perhaps, but sporty!

Unfavorable considerations:
* There have been a couple of problems with the car. Saturn has made those easy to deal with by being up-front and rapid about fixing them. We had an emissions system problem early on (the 'check engine' light was going on for no reason), and then we got some noise in the cabin which turned out to be an engine mounting bracket that had sagged a bit. I've been impressed with how Saturn has responded to these issues. Saturn has been straightforward about these problems. They've also communicated about them to their technicians in the field so that they know how to diagnose and fix them.<br><br>
