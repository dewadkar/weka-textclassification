             The 2000 Dodge Neon is a decent car for city or suburban driving. It's a sporty looking car, and has some muscle for a 4 cylinder engine.

 It's very easy to drive. It has good pickup, yet the car won't run away from you when you hit the gas pedal. Fuel economy is acceptably mid-range. heat and A/C are hot and cold as advertised.

 The sound system has six speakers and sounds great. I got the optional 4 disc in dash cd changer and it is well worth it.

 The car is reliable, it's been recalled twice, but other than that I've had no mechanical problems in two years of driving. (Note: The recalls were related to the brakes and the engine, but both were voluntary and were not an immediate safety hazard) 

 As well as the car is put together mechanically, it is not interior-wise. The interior of both front doors started coming off after a few months of opening and closing. After being fixed by the dealer the problem came back right away. The problem is so bad that sometimes the doors will not close unless I pop the panels in all the way. The interior of the door should be much better built, you pull on it every time you get in the car!  There is also a rattling sound that comes from the center panel of the dashboard, as if something is always loose. 

 Interior comfort is lacking at best. The front seats are comfortable enough, the armrests however are another story. the door armrests are uncomfortable to use when gripping the wheel, and the center armrest is hard and too small for both front seat passengers to share. Legroom and headroom are alright. Rear seating is uncomfortable and cramped, but hey, that's to be expected in a compact/midsize.

 There are some design flaws as well, I can't believe designers didn't notice that when you even crack the windows in the rain, it rains in the car! Nothing like getting soaked for a little ventilation. The trunk lid closes on me regardless of how high i pick it up, it has no support system to keep it open. There is no in-dash ashtray (which for non-smokers was still a useful change tray), or cigarette lighter attachment, just a "power outlet". There are no ashtrays in the back either, which can be inconvenient.

 Cruise control does not come standard, which means driving (with the lack of interior comfort as well) long distances can be somewhat tiring. A three hour highway drive can be exhausting on the legs without this.

 The car's exterior is quite crash worthy, I got into an accident that was forceful enough to shatter the windshield, but the car only suffered minor exterior damage.

 I would recommend the Neon for people who commute often or take many short trips, but for long hauls, the Neon is just too uncomfortable. If you travel by car long distances for work or pleasure, you might want to consider a more comfortable ride.
