            I purchased my Passat 1.8T 2 years ago.  It is basically a good car.  And it is a real "entry level German car" you can find in Canada.  Other European cars (really made in Germany) are more expensive than this one.  The VW cars which is cheaper than the Passat are made in Mexico.

During the past 2 years, I have replaced my heated seat (it didn't work after the 1st winter) and replaced the water pump (told by VW mechanics that there is a leak) at 28000Km.  

A friend of mine bought the same model with the same accessories at the same time I bought mine.  His car has more problem than mine.  The car was dead on the road twice.  Something was wrong with the engine.  

Now, my car has ran 70,000km.  I found that it started to have some problem.  When my foot is off the gas pedal (from low speed to 80km/h), the car seems pushing forward for half second.  

Since VW offers warranty upto 40,000km, I am afraid that future maintenance is expensive as it is an European car.  The dealer recommends a CDN$40 lube for the Passat.

If you mind the pick up speed, you should consider the V6 rather than the 1.8T.  1.8T is good in gas consumption.  1 full tank last upto 500-600km (highway + local).  But the pick up is not quick because it is a heavy car.
