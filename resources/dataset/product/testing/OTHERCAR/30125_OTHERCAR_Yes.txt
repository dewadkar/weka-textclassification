            I actually do not own an '87, but I have had two 1988 Chevy Novas.  I basically owned my mom's when I was 16.  It had 141,000 miles on it, and I fell asleep at the wheel.  The Nova struck an embankment at 60mph and flipped over twice.  My girlfriend and I both survived with bruises and scrapes.  Furthermore, the ten year old, 141,000 mile engine WAS STILL RUNNING.  It was deemed totaled, which was disappointing.

Naturally, when I earned enough money for another car, I got a 1988 Nova Hatchback.  I've put 40,000 miles on it (there were 45,000 to begin with- got it off an old lady!).  I use it to haul stuff to and from college, 300 miles away- and it still holds up.  Most of that 300 miles is on highways were I am doing 70+mph, and the little Nova keeps up with traffic and STILL runs.

All in all, I've put close to 60,000 miles on Novas and the ONLY time I've been left on the side of the road was when I had the accident.  I had to replace the CV boots, but that's just rubber dry-rotting, so ANY car will need that someday.  

Because it is front wheel drive, and has decent ground clearance, this is a decent car for traveling in snow.

The only cosmetic defect I had was the falling headliner.  This was true of almost all GM cars of the era.  I actually took the board out and using the screws in the trim already, hung Christmas tree skirt.  It still sags, but it looks really cool.

This is one of the most useful cars I've ever seen.  It's bigger than most hatchbacks, and the four doors make it great for late night Wal-Mart trips (VT students know what I mean!).  Pile 5 people in safely, or just yourself- fold down the rear seat and the front seat and haul lumber.  In fact, I have piled 5 people in my car, in seatbelts and put a 7' Christmas tree IN the car so that the hatch was shut!
