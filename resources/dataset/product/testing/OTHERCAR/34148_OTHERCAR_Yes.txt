            Many times I have overlooked the Lexus in favor of the Range Rover and Hummer because I didn't think it was that serious of an off road vehicle.  Then Lexus added the air suspension so I thought I'd at least stop by and take a look.  This is the most accommodating and comfortable vehicle I have ever been in.  It is quiet and elegant and I feel safe and pampered riding in it.  The service I have gotten at Land Rover has been just horrible.  For as often as their vehicles need to be repaired, I would think their staff would be a little more accommodating and I have heard this from the majority of people who have ever dealt with them.  Lexus on the other hand offered to drive 100 miles and pick my vehicle up to do the oil changes!  The Lexus seats 8 where as the range rover only holds 5 and it is just all around more comfortable.  The only thing I wish the lexus had is dual zone a/c for the driver and passenger, though i have never been uncomfortable driving or riding.  If you have 3 kids and just cant stomach a mini-van this one of your few options, the others being a Land rover discovery (feels like the apartment version of the range rover though), the durango (yuck yuck yuck, loud and really cheaply made), or the expedition (1. Ford, 2. Might as well get a Van).<br><br>
