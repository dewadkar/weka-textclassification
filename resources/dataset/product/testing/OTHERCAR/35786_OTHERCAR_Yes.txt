                 I am a owner of a red 1994 Saturn SL1.  There are so many great things I can say about this car.  It is my first car and I have been nothing but pleased with it.  When I buying it, new in 1994, I thought to my self &quot;Saturn Family? How cheesy is that.&quot; but now I completely understand what it's all about.  Saturn not only provides you with a high quality car for less money but it makes you apart of something that no other car dealership does.  This applies to any used or new car bought at any Saturn dealership in the world.  Oil change is free, and parts and labor are cheap.  They really know their stuff.  OK, now back to the car.  It's a real surprise that the car has such great pick-up.  The styling on this model is really sleek, unlike the models after it which were more bubble like.  The stock audio system is really good, with a high output.  Trunk space is big for a small coupe and the fold down rear seats are great for bikes and groceries.  I bought mine for $12,000 new in 1994 and I am positive that I would buy the same thing again if presented with that option.  This model is superb. I have had few problems, never anything clutch or engine wise and when i did have a problem, i.e. BRAKES, Saturn was quick to find it and fix it in less than a day.  Well, I love my Saturn and I am glad I am part of the Saturn Family.<br><br>
