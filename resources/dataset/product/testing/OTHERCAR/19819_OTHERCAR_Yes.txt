            I purchased my 1996 Toyota Paseo in august of '00. It is an automatic, with ac, power steering, cruise control, dual airbags, cd player, overdrive, alloy wheels, spoiler, you name it, i have it. My test drive was decent, and I had been in a bind so i purchased it right away. Since then, I haven't had realy any problems. My fanbelt has squealed a few times, but that was it. It gets me from place to place it has incredible pickup for an automatic, it's just a cute little first car. However, people with children or many friends beware. The backseat can accomadate carseats, but its a aqueeze.. the arm rest of my son's seat hits my rear winshield making it difficult to strap in. Once its done, however, its good to go. Also, I would NOT recomment having people in the back seat. its too small for any normal sized human to be comfortable in. All in all, I love it.
