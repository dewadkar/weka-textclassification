            I have owned my Accord EX for 5 years (purchased new in 94) I cant say that it has been a bad car..up till now it has been fine, other than the standard routine maintenance, which can be very expensive, I have had no complaints.  I believed in the value of my car and maintained it according to the dealers advice and recommendations with regular scheduled maintenance.  Then in December my Accord with 60,000 miles on it blew an engine seal.  I had recently taken the car for its 60,000 mile checkup and had the muffler and CV boots and joints replaced, along with the front brakes.  This service cost me more than $800.00.  
Less than 2 weeks later, the seal blew, and all of the oil drained from the car on to the engine, tires and on to the ground, all in a matter of minutes.  The car had to be towed back to the dealer,(which I had to pay for) who informed me that this was not related to anything they missed or did during the checkup.  They would not have seen a problem unless oil was present at the time.  This repair...cost me $607.00, a discounted amount that was reduced after I loudly complained that it was excessive.  The labor alone was $400.00, a new timing belt had to be put in $163.00, and the seals $15.00, and the replacement of the fluids.  Needless to say I was not happy.  
I am not a naive person, and I know that you can not buy a car, any car, even a Honda and not expect routine maintenance and occasional problems.  But a 5 year old Honda with 60,000 miles on it...blows an engine seal!?!?!?!
I have done alot of research on this and have found that it is fairly common, and that Honda has been putting clamps on the seals to hold them in..rather than fixing the problem at the source.  How nice for them..it seems that they would rather that their customers pay this costly repair bill than stand behind their cars and fix it themselves.  The things I have found in my research have outraged me.  I find it very difficult to say anything good about this vehicle, when I, and many other Accord owners with this same problem, have been treated so unfairly.
I feel that Honda is treating their loyal customers in a very cavalier manner.  I have received no help from anyone at the dealership or from Honda Motor car.  I purchased this car partially for its resale value, that value has been lost to me in the inconvenience, treatment received, and the amount of money I have had to spend to repair it. I will not purchase another Honda vehicle.<br><br>
