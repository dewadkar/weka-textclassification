            By the urging of my Mother-in-law.  We bought a Honda. She also had one, and loved hers. Let me tell you it was the best thing we did.  It was a 1990 Honda accord DX. We drove cross country SEVERAL times without a problem. We still have the 1990 Honda accord. Last year, we bought a new HONDA ACCORD LX this time. It was everything we expected we love it.  For a family of 4 its perfect.  Its roomy enough for the kids to take all the toys they want.  It runs really smooth.  I am always running errands and its great on gas. All the buttons in the front panel are easily available. I have nothing bad to say about this car.  I'm positive the next car we buy will also be a Honda. <br><br>
