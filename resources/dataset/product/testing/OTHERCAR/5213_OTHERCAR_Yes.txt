            I bought this camera in the summer of 1999 because I wanted to be able to take many pictures at once. Having used it for over a year, I've learned to love the ease and usefulness of digital cameras, however not the image quality and features. Since my camera has been stolen, I have gone back to my 35mm.

The Fuji DX-10 does not have a zoom lens. This is a major drawback for a digital camera, because there are times when the subject you are taking pictures of is too far away. It does have adequate resolution for internet work.

The resolution is pretty good even compared to cameras out on the market now. For most people, a 3 megapixel camera is overkill unless you intend to print out your photos, or if you want to be able to view them on high quality displays 10 years from now when desktop technology catches up.

There are no special features such as burst modes, animation, or movie modes. This is one reason why I intend to purchase another brand of camera (probably a SONY).

I was able to take as many as 250 pictures at a time in 640x480 mode on my SmartMedia card. I would recommend getting the floppy disk adapter if you do a lot of photo work. I work with a few hundred images a month or more.

The batteries (4 AA) will last a long time if you do not use the LCD display. I learned to use it without the display, and only use the LCD on rare occasions.

If you are interested in buying a new digital camera, I highly recommend you find one with a minimum of a 3x zoom. This camera however is a great buy for the right price (like under $200).
