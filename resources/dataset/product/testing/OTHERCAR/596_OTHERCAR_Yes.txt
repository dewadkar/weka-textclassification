            From a woman's point of view I love this car. Not only is this car great to look at but it is also very reliable and easy to maneuver. The seats are extremely comfortable especially with the seat warmers and electric adjustable seats. It's a SUV but small so it is not intimidating to drive in. I definitely recommend getting the leather seats, moonroof, and a 6 CD changer. The control settings are easy to find and figure out.
Sorry about the lack of technicals, but I just really do not know anything about cars. I usually buys cars depending on how comfortable I feel in them, and Lexus RX 300 is very comfy b/c it is so easy to control. The only problem I have with it is that I usually find myself losing control of the car on snow and ice covered roads even with snow tires. This car is light weight compared to other SUVs. Overall, the RX300 is smooth and painfully luxurious.
