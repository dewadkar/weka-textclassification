            I purchased a 1994 Altima in 97'. I was considering a Sentra, but I was in luck to see that there was a used Altima left. The car had 45,500 miles on it, so basically it was still in its infancy. It had some of its new car smell inside, and had a few very minor visual blemishes.

The road test was what I had expected. The 2.4liter 4 cylinder performed as it should. It provided brisk acceleration and it was a reasonable ride. The suspension itself was a little tighter than I had expected and there was a little bit more road noise than usual. The power can mostly be felt between 4000 and 6000 RPM, which is decent in passing situations, but at times it proves to be not quite enough. On the highway, the Altima blends in and is competent in keeping the pace with traffic. The brakes are a little bit better than average with disc in the front and drum in the rear. The seating in the back was quite cramped for Adults, but I have yet to get complaints. Seating for the driver and passenger is quite comfortable without any discomfort. 

My Nissan now has 139,000 miles on it and I had only 1 instance where I needed a tow truck. My altenator gave out as well as my battery too. This is routine maintenance, in which I lent a blind eye to. All other costs have been fuel, tune ups, tires, and oil changes. All routine maintenance which is expected of all cars.....so you can't go wrong with that.

As of now, my car still runs like new and there are no odd engine noises. Just a rattle or two from the cabin that comes and goes. I've taken it on many road trips and I've been quite impressed, but its what I expected of a Nissan anyway. You can't go wrong, its a reliable and relatively good ride.
