            The first thing that attracted me to this car was it's looks. Granted, I knew nothing about cars at the time I bought the Celica - I didnt know what signicifance turbos, all wheel drive, or 6 cylinder engines had. I practically bought the car on impulse - my old Taurus was on its last legs, and I had to get something immediately. What a terrible thing to do with a car purchase - because I could have done MUCH better.

The 2000  Celica looks great. That's all. It is a horribly slow, weak car. The salesman will pitch how powerful the GT-S engine is, however, it is mediocre. The engine has a too high a compression to satisfy your dreams of ever installing a turbo, and TRD is neglecting to ever produce a supercharger for the Celica (to your frustration, they have supercharged practically every truck Toyota produces, as well as the Camry and Solara). This car has poor aftermarket in the engine department - mainly because of the compression, and aftermarket companies' fear to produce turbo kits for the car. You're pretty much stuck with exhausts and CAI's, as well as a huge array of bodykits, if you're into the appearance thing. The aftermarket for this car is VERY expensive, especially from hack companies like TRD. 

I never had to take this car in for repairs - beyond my headlights blowing out after I installed hyper whites - stupid Toyota built the car so that it cannot accomodate such headlights. Too bad...

Another disappointment - the interior is horribly cheap and flimsy. After a month or so, the inside of the doors WILL be scratched up from your seat belt buckle. Why couldnt they have at least given us a nice "pleather" interior? I believe the 2003  models have black interior...whereas the 2000-2002 interiors are a dull gray.

On a lighter note, this is a very lightweight car, and is superb in handling! In fact, you can't find many other cars that will handle as well as this one (hence why many Celica owners mod their suspensions before anything else). 

Another important thing to note - this is a very noisy car- the engine sounds like it struggles as you hit the high RPMs, and there will always be a persistant "I think I'm driving through a wind tunnel" noise as you drive at highway speeds, making you have to turn your radio way up high.
