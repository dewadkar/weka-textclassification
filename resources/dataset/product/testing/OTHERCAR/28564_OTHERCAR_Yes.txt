            When somebody says the word &quot;Jeep&quot;, people automatically think of the Jeep Wrangler.  After all, this awesome four wheel driving machine has been around for how long?  The beautiful thing about the Wrangler is even if you compare it to the very first Willey's, they haven't changed all that much...style-wise.  As a vehicle itself, it has made leaps and bounds.

Jeep changed the design of the Wrangler in 1997 (model year), and skipped the 1996 model year because they wanted this new Jeep to be just perfect.  Although no vehicle is perfect, the new Wrangler is a slice of Heaven.  It's definitely in my top 10 lists in quite a few categories.  Most Jeep purists don't like the new design for many of reasons, but I've always been one to accept progression and not throw rocks at it.  If you're the same way, I'm sure you'll like the new Wrangler (they even went back to the round head lights!!!)

New for the 2000 model, there isn't too much of a change.  I believe the only change had to do with colors (that new Solar Yellow is hideous) and options availability.  I believe the sound bar now comes with all trim levels.  This is just what I heard, but I recommend getting a sound bar put in just in case.  The two small speakers in from just don't do any sort of music any justice...especially on the highway with the top down.  The sound bar is a nice feature because you get sound coming from in front, from behind, and on top of you.  This makes for a nicer drive alone.

With the new redesign in 1997, one of my favorite things that Jeep did is replace the suspension.  Because the Wrangler has such a short wheel base, the leaf suspension in the back made the Jeep a very bouncy ride.  Don't get me wrong, it was very capable off road, but the good news is:  IT STILL IS!  Driving a 1995 to a 1997 is a big jump indeed!  It's almost like driving in a Cadillac after driving in a Colt for years.  As a matter of fact, the new Wrangler shares the same suspension as the newly redesigned Grand Cherokee.  It includes a solid axle in front and back for 4x4 purposes and quality, along with coil (called quadra-coil) suspension in the front and back.  It still handles with grace off road, and makes driving through the streets that much easier.

Something else with the Jeep Wrangler I am very fond of is the inclusion of the passenger air bag shut-off switch.  I believe they started to include this as standard equipment in mid-season '98.  None the less, if you have kids, or are married to anybody under 5 feet tall (I have both), this is a fantastic thing to have.  The back seat just isn't big enough for a car seat, so there may be some instances that you HAVE to put a child up front.  I consider it emergencies only, but I think it's a wonderful thing for Jeep include!

One of the downfalls of the Jeep Wrangler is the seating arrangement.  It's only a 4-seater, and only available in the US in a 2-door model (although I have seen a 4-door version by somebody like Bejing Jeep).  Jeep is working on something like the Wrangler as I write, but it's a 4 door model called the Dakar (I think).  The seats are very comfortable, but only in cloth.  The vinyl seats are horrid.  Get the optional cloth seats.  They don't cost that much more.  Stay away from those vinyl things.  It's the standard seats in the SE and the Sport (I believe).  Seating may be a little cramped, but it's something you get used to very quick.  It's no worse than driving a Miata or MR2...but the Wrangler is a LOT more fun.

Something else that Jeep did with the new Wrangler's is lower the amount of road noise you get with the soft top.  Most people that would be using their Wrangler's as a primary vehicle would opt for the hard top because the soft tops used to be so noisy you'd need to yell at highway speeds.  The new soft top structure is not only quieter, but also easy to put down and put back up.  They included a big metal bar in the front of the soft top, so it looks a bit odd to have that big bulge there when the top is up, but it works miracles.

Unlike older Jeep Wrangler's, you'll turn the heat on in the winter time and...what's that?..oh, it's HEAT!  Yes, in '97 Jeep gave the new Wrangler a new heating system to compliment it nicely.  Gorgeous.

Okay, you got stuck in the rain with the top down.  Now it's all wet and all dirty.  Man, what are you going to do?  Easy, take the carpets out, hose down the interior, and let it dry.  The Wrangler's interior is still made to be washed out with the old garden hose.  This makes off-roading a REAL hoot!

A problem that I ran into was when I was taking the side doors off.  They were easy enough to take off, but the interior wouldn't shut-off.  I figured there would be a switch or overide to press to get around this problem, but no.  I manually pulled the fuse inside the Jeep for the interior light.  Whether this is the right or wrong way to do it, it's a real pain in the neck.  Small price to pay for something as fun and open as a Wrangler.  It could be worse, you could be driving an Amigo.

The base trim level, called the SE, seems to be the most popular one on the roads today.  My biggest qualm with the SE is the engine.  There is only one choice and that's the 2.5L 4 cylinder.  I pumps out about 140 horses, and makes passing on the highway no option.  It's fine for driving through town, but couple that puppy up with a 3-speed automatic and you have a full-fledged sled.  It can't get out of it's own way.  If you insist on the SE trim, buy one with the 5-speed.  If you can't drive 5-speed then shell out the extra cash for the Sport trim with the 4.0L or forever be smoked.  Another thing that I don't care for on the SE is you can't get one with the rear Dana 44 axle.  You're stuck with a Dana 30 in front and a Dana 35 in back.  If you're into off-roading, especially racing, the SE will do you no justice my friend.

The Sport is my choice.  Being the middle trim you upgrade to the 4.0L I-6 engine found in the Cherokee's an Grand Cherokees.  I don't know why, but it doesn't produce as much horsepower as the two Cherokees.  The Cherokee pumps 190hp and the 2000 Grand Cherokee was tweaked to 195hp, but the Wrangler is still wrangling along at ~180hp range (I believe it's 183hp to be exact).  With such a small vehicle, the Sport whips right along!  It's a great thing to have when you're smoking Sportages and Tracker's off-road (yes, people actually do take those things off-road every now and again).  The Sport does carry some other nice things that the SE does not like the optional Dana 44 rear axle, but I'd buy one just for the engine.

The Sahara is overkill.  Too much junk I would never use.  Most you'll find as an automatic with air conditioning, trendy blah seats.  Blah blah blah.  If you're a rich and trendy fellow, you'll probably like the Sahara.  Be careful not to spill your decaf mocha capaccino on the seats over those bumps.  They're not for me, thanks.  Jeep purists pick on the poor people to buy the Sahara's.  I'm not a Jeep purist, I don't pick on Sahara owners, I just think they're unnecessary for something like a Wrangler.

Overall, the Jeep Wrangler has made plenty of progress over the years.  Rumor is, they acquired the name &quot;Jeep&quot; from that little guy in the Popeye cartoons named &quot;Jeep&quot;.  He was a little critter that could do anything and go anywhere (incase you're not familiar with Popeye cartoons).  I couldn't think of a better name than for something of this much capability on road and off.  It may be a bit too primitive for some people with no power windows, no power locks, no leather interior, no nothing of that nature.  If that's what you're looking for in the first place, you should be driving a car.  Top of the line 4x4 system, tight turning ratios, new suspension and several other factors go into making this tiny little powerhouse one of the funnest and greatest vehicles on the market today.  In case you've never owned a Jeep CJ through Wrangler, have you ever wondered why they all wave to each other when the pass?  It's called pride in Jeep and a quality product, my friend.<br><br>
