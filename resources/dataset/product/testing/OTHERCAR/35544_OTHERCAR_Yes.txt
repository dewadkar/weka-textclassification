            I just traded in my 2001 Ram Truck for the 2003 quad cab 4X4.  The diesel is so much quieter, I don't have to turn it off to go through a drive-through.  This truck and the diesel have both been completely reengineered. Even though the power in my previous truck amazed me, this one is even more powerful. It's much better mannered, too. It's not only quieter running, it doesn't roar when it shifts.  There is just this quiet surge of power.  With the new design, the ride is a lot smoother--getting out of my drive no longer spills my tea! Going off road doesn't jar my teeth out, either. The handling is much better--while this is a truck, it feels much more like I remember a car feeling.  Lane changes are quick and easy.  The other truck felt precarious in a quick bumpy turn.  This one feels stable and sure-footed (sure-wheeled?).  The turning radius is smaller than in the 2001, but I haven't measured it.  When I did my test drive, I did circles in an empty parking lot and these are smaller.  

The shift lever for the automatic has been redesigned so that it's now possible to tell that the gearshift is fully engaged without looking. It's got sort of an arc-shaped feel to it, easy on the wrist. The overdrive button is now on the end of the shift lever.  I drove this truck for the first time in the dark and couldn't figure out what the button did--finally, I saw the little OD on the dash wink on and off when I pushed it.

Even though I don't have the automatic climate control system, it is possible to adjust driver and passenger-side temps to differing degrees of warmth.  I had to look a bit to find a truck with the optional side-impact airbags and am delighted to have them.  The automatic seat, which my last truck lacked, combined with the adjustable pedals let met sit farther back from the airbag.  For the first time in my life, I feel like I wouldn't bite the wheel in a crash.  I have the optional mirrors which already have the little round fish-eye mirrors on them and they flip to provide a longer view if I'm ever towing a trailer.  I was told they aren't heated, but they are, at least in this model. The seats are heated, too.  I can't tell you how great that heated seat felt when I turned it on.  It melted away the muscle tension in my back and shoulders.  I haven't put many miles on this yet, but did notice, this morning, when I was tossing in bales of hay, that I didn't seem to have to lift them quite as far.  It seems as if the bed is lower, but I believe the ground clearance is better.  Also, there is a skid plate under the truck.  This one also has a button on the dash to engage 4-wheel drive, a nice change from having to fight the floor-mounted lever on the other truck.  I could never tell where that was set.

There are other new amenities too.  There's a trash bag hook in the front seat, nice for messy folks like me.  There's an improved console between the seats with a cell phone plug built in.  Also, the center seat now has storage under it.  The back seats fold up, just as in the 2001, but there's now storage under them, and something really cool, a metal fold-down floor, to give you a flat surface.  There are now lights that shine into the bed, so you can see what you're doing at night--which seems to be when I have time to load and unload the hay.  The trailer plug-ins are now neatly in a covered socket rather than hanging from the front bumper.  The jack is now hidden under the front passenger seat.

I "had" to take a truck with the Laramie package to get the side airbags.  That means I now have color-keyed bumpers and grill, an in-dash 5 CD changer and nice stereo, and leather-trimmed seats.  That means that most of the seats are leather, but there are fake-suede insets in the backs with the Ram logo.  They look great and feel wonderful.  This truck also came with a sliding window over the bed. Oh---it has 4 real doors, too.

I've only put 75 miles on the truck, so can't tell you about mileage yet.  I have a gear ratio that will cut my mileage a bit, but will give me more power on the starts if I ever get that trailer.  I'm told it will cut my top end speed, but I've driven this far enough to know that it will go as fast as I ever want to move.  I hit 80 passing a hay truck the other day on the way home and there was plenty of power and speed to spare.

I loved my previous truck, but this one is delightful!  It's tall and a stretch to climb in for a shortie like me, but I think the height and weight in the last helped me come through a crash in the old one with only a little stiffness, so I wanted it again.  A lot of people think the 4X4 is an ego thing for people, but I've needed it several times.  Living where I do, it gets pretty wet, so I've had to use it to get out of mud and to pull my riding mower out, when it got stuck. I like the height and the great view of the road.  

Also, I found a great dealership in Moultrie, Georgia, who provides very reliable service.  This is the second vehicle I've bought from them and a number of friends drive an hour and a half to buy there when there are several closer dealers.  I found one in Albany, Georgia, where the salesman was rude and obnoxious, insulted me twice, and still expected me to buy from him, after I contronted him about it. They wanted what I paid for this truck for a truck without any of the amenities. 

I have found that none of the salesmen at a whole range of dealerships know a lot about the details of the vehicles (mileage, turning radius, features).  I found out more in a quick trip to the Internet than any of them know.  Still, I couldn't find a listing of features in the various packages either in the very expensive truck catalog or on the net.

I think that when a manufacturer sells a truck this far off the ground, it makes sense to have steps built in.  Based on the prices at the dealership for after-market items, my guess is that profit drives that decision.  I found that dealer-installed steps cost several hundred dollars more than I paid a year ago for steps, a drop-in bed liner, and a bed mat out in the community.  Still, I don't have to buy them from the dealer--unless I want some that will match the color of the truck.
