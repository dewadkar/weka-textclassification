            What a great camera this is !!! It's one of the bets digital cmaeras on the market, even thogh it is only around four hundred dollars. I have one and I am completely satisfied!y favorite feature is choice of picture quality level. I generally use &quot;high,&quot;
                       which allows you storage of seventeen pictures. Picture quality at this
                       setting is absolutely gorgeous! At &quot;medium&quot; quality, you can store forty
                       shots, with acceptable results. I wouldn't recommend &quot;low&quot; (with storage for
                       eighty pictures) unless quality isn't an issue. I heard from my friend that there is a new version coming out in about a month that will actually have a digital and optical zoom. It will cost only about a hundred dollars more, but still. If I were you, I would wait for a little, and then get the one with zoom. This baby will last you for a while! Recommmend!<br><br>
