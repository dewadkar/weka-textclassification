            Consumer Reports hates this vehicle.  And they should.  The ride is bumpy, the steering a little stiff, handling in adverse weather (specifically snow) is not the greatest and it is one of those rollover prone vehicles if mistreated.

But it's a Jeep.  A Jeep Wrangler...it SUPPOSED to be all that.  And it is so fun you end up not caring about the ride because it is part of the experience.  The loud wind noise with the top down is what you're LOOKING for when you buy it.  It really IS a Jeep thing.  And some who drive these things develop an attitude about it.

I was sick of riding along and not being a participant in my driving experience. I got my second Wrangler (The Sport model.  I had a '94 Sport before this one and then took a "few years off").  Now I have a great time with the top dropped commuting to work.

The new design of the soft top frame and door frames that are integrated with it are a big improvement over past methods of putting the soft top up and down.  But as always the zippers are hard to work and it takes some muscle to get the windows back in after having the top down.  Especially, if it the weather is cooler.

The hard top is well designed and fits on well.  It is a little thinner in thickness than previous tops but it has designed in stengthening channels and less material in construction makes it lighter giving better ability to remove it and also better gas mileage I would think.

The 4.0 litre engine is powerful and rugged.  I have not driven the 2.5 litre but it seems that this would not provide enough power to be worthwhile.  But it may also minimize the propensity in bad weather to spin the back tires. 

If you are willing to do a little work, this is a great vehicle to own as you can make it quiet (relatively) with the hard top or drop the top and remove the doors for openness wind and fun.

Between the Sport and the Sahara you are really just paying for different seats and a paint job.  Save your money.  The ride is the same.
