            We bought a 1996 Cavalier for my wife, it was the best money I ever spent 
on a car!!. I now drive the car full time and love it!! The repairs have been very few (power steering pump, one hose) oil, tires and gas. It's
still looks great and is fun to drive too. For people in winter weather areas the front wheel drive is like having tank tracks instead of wheels.
The car has a long life battery, 100,000 mile spark plugs and a stainless
steel exhust. I haven't changed the brakes yet but they will need to be done before winter. If you are looking for a used one look for low miles, 
maintence records. The cars body doesn't have one spot of rust, we live in salted road country so we see a lot of rusty cars. Honestly I have to say this car is the best car we have ever owned. We have about 45000 miles on the car. Good Luck!!
