            I first purchased this car in the middle of my university career, and I was at the time deciding between the Civic SIR or the Integra. I made the choice to go with the Integra GS just cause it seemed EVERYONE had a Civic and the Integra looked a little more stylish than the slightly more boxy civic. So my choice to initially buy the car was very thin. But as I grew to learn the car and take it through its paces, I realized the value that I had gotten out of my purchase.

Not only did the car look great with its stylish lines and aggressive look (thank goodness they changed the grill to a more open design), but it had the engine to back up its exterior. The 1.8L engine running about 140hp was plenty for city/highway driving. The engine really shows its power as you shift to second gear on the manual (You HAVE to get manual to really appreciate the design by the Honda engineers) and nail the gas. 

The double-wishbone suspension also makes the car extremely nimble, comparatively to the new standard MacPherson struts. I take this car to autocrosses and even as I raced it as a stock (unmodified) car, the car performed exceptionally well. Its cornering and ability to hug the course really put it ahead of its class. The only trouble with the Integra in its turns are when you really try to pull a hard turn too quickly and the back end of the car, being considerably light, loses some traction. This causes your car to be "tail-happy" but this is a small occurrence. 

The car handles in most conditions of the year and I think that it performs well. I lived in Calgary for about a year and during that year, there were record snowstorms and my Integra was able to keep itself together on all of the roads, highways, and smaller streets. The only consideration is that you get a good set of winter tires to help you grip the ice or snow a little better. The Integra excellently handles the rain also as I hail from Vancouver.

The interior is usually most people's concern with the lack of space in the rear two seats. And it's mine as well. =) The car is actually very good at handling a lot of load and is very useful in moving things around once you take the trunkcover and fold the seats down. I was able to fit a full 7-piece drumset and a guitar amp.. while still being able to fit two more people in the car. So if your passengers in the back of the car are inanimate objects, you're all good. The layout of the console and the displays are excellent with the tachometer and speedometer nice and big. The CD player and other environmental controls are all placed well for both the driver and passenger to control if need be... which makes for many radio station changes. =)

The bucket seats that come with the car, are quite comfy support your lateral movement.. and they give you a sense of that racing seat feel. The steering wheel is adjustable in pitch, to fit the height of the driver. The shiftknob for the manual transmission is tucked close to the driver so that all the necessary pieces to drive the vehicle are within easy reach of the driver. The driving position for the Integra is well fitted to anyone who loves the thrill of the road with all your controls at your fingertips. 

The seating material, either the upholstery or the leather are both good (I have the leather and it's awesome). On long trips, the car handles very well, and it doesn't take too much effort, even with the manual transmission, to drive the vehicle. I drove my car multiple times from Vancouver to Calgary, Alberta which is approximately a 1300km trip (800 miles). The trip was made easy by the fact that there was still enough torque in the fifth gear, to overtake another vehicle, if necessary. 

The noise level of the car is quite quite comparatively to other cars in the same power range as the Integra even though the manual transmission always helps (CLUTCH!). The main comment I get about my car when others drive it, is the fact that the throw for the shiftknob is so short. And I have to agree. After driving a '97 Civic DX for a while, moving to the manual transmission on the Integra was a joy. The shorter throw allows for a quicker shift, which lets you accelerate quicker without losing too much RPM in the shift. 

The car does tend to "roar" slightly as it gets into the higher RPM's, around 5500. That's the RPM at which your horsepower peaks. When I say "roar", don't start thinking that it's a "whiny" sound. The engine sounds aggressive even as it hits closer to the redline. And as you hit those RPM, you really feel the car pull from underneath you.

Finally, the mileage on this car is extremely good, especially if you don't drive it too aggressively through the city. I get about 450-500km per tank of gas. So running at a specified 50L tank, that's about 10km/L for combined city/highway driving. Your mileage will always vary with your driving style so don't quote me on that number. =)

Overall, the car is great ride, and is well worth the investment. I enjoy every moment in the car and I truly try to keep "my beauty" looking just like when I got it out of the dealership... ahhhh..=)
