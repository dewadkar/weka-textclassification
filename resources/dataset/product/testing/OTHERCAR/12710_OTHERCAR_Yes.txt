            I love my 1997 Chevy Cavalier RS.  I've got the purple which looks very nice for a female (wouldn't recommend to a male - ha ha), but it is hard to find touch-up paint for this color.  Has to be specially ordered.
Cassette stereo has great sound.  Large trunk offers room for anything you can imagine and the backseat folds down for even more storage or slide-through capabilities.
Haven't had to do much maintenance on car besides the usual tire change, oil change, engine maintenance, etc.  Hard to reach headlights though if I needed to change a bulb.  But going on 5+ years of having my Cavalier and never once had to change a bulb on front OR back of car.
Bucket seats offer a good amount of room.  Backseats are a little cramped and difficult to get out of due to the design being "sloped".  Disappointed that side back windows don't pop open like the older models of the 2-door Cavaliers used to do.
Mechanism on power window on driver's side had to be replaced due to wear & tear.  Had a few recalls on car, but nothing serious.
Definitely worth the money I paid, hope to have the car last another 5 years!
Recommend to all!
