            I had this car for awhile and first I thought this is the nicest car I ever owned, it was so comfortable and so nice inside, teh interior had nice seats that you can live in, angled stereo and vents, controls looked a little too complicated but fancy.  There is a feel of luxury.  The drivability was worse.  Uphill driving was troublesome, brakes made the whole car vibrate and thin sqeak can be heard.  Because of all the coolant leaks and hard starts I gave up with it after awhile.

If it has low miles on it you are in luck, I am sure it is a good car when it is new, but after 70,000 it is going to lose its power and its reliability. Watch out for any leaks, they are costly to repair sometimes.<br><br>
