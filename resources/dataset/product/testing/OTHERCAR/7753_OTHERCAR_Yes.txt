               I bought a Mercury Tracer in 1994.  I previously owned a Ford Escort.
I will take the Tracer over the Escort any day of the week.  The Tracer is
much more comfortable, more quieter, and much easier to handle.  And the price is lower than the Escort!!

   I have 123,000 miles on my Tracer.  I never even got 70,000 on my
Escort.  I am most sad that they have stopped manufacturing the Tracer.
It is a great car for the money.

   There is nothing that I dislike about the Mercury Tracer.  I love to drive and I do drive a lot.  When I leave work each day, I look forward to sitting in my car.  It is so comfortable, that I get to relax on the drive home.

   The Tracer handles very well in the snow.  I have never gotten stuck in the snow, or mud for that matter.

     I feel that anyone who needs good, reliable, and inexpensive transportation should buy a Mercury Tracer.<br><br>
