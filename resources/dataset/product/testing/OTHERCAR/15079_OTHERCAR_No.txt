            When digital cameras were first coming out, I was eager to purchase one.  Upon doing so, I looked for features such as slim, inexpensive, use of floppy disks, quality photos.  This only met one and a half of those requirements, use of floppy disks, and somewhat quality photos.  With a max resoultion of on 640X480 I was very disappointed.  However it already came with the floppy adapter (costing hundreds more to attach to other cameras).  I took it to a trip to the  beach, and took random pictures.  Upon arrival to my home the next day, I put the floppy disk (capable of holding 20-40 pictures) in my computer and looked at the pictures.  They weren't great at all.  Some pictures has bluriness, while others had poor lighting coping.  I would definately not recommend this to anyone.<br><br>
