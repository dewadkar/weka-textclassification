            After Mercury dropped the Cougar after the 1997 model, they hit the drawing board and came up with a completely different car.  What did they do? Everything!  They gave it a sleek, sporty look, and decieved the eyes be making the new Cougar look rather compact, but with pleanty of leg room and a huge cargo space.  They tossed in very stylish bucket seats in the front and back.  Rear seats fold down, (split), for even more cargo area.  How about the amenities?? Driver and passenger side airbags, STANDARD! Air conditioning, STANDARD! Power windows and door locks, STANDARD!  Power driver's seat height adjust, STANDARD!  Digital display shows average miles per gallon, estimated miles that can be traveled on remaining gas, digital trip meter, average miles per hour, outside temperature....I had to say &quot;Wow!&quot; when I was learning what this car came with, (for the price tag). I was amazed!  Available in an I4 or V6, both with enough pep to keep you in trouble. Starts at about $16,000 and fully loaded at about $22,000.  I definitely recommend giving this car a test drive!<br><br>
