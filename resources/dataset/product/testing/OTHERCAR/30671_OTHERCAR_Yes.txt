            Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best car I've ever owned!!! Roomy, reliable and built with quality. Leather interior is great, washable so doesn't stain and looks new all the time. No major car trouble, only take in for maintenance (oil change, etc.). Car has a lot of power, makes going up hills a little easier without the feeling of strain. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is easy to drive, very comfortable. Height is good, can see over most cars and don't feel like I'm going to tip over every time I go around a curve. Body is durable as I was in an accident where the other car hit me and the only thing that broke was my tail light. The other car had a huge dent. Car is roomy enough for 5 passengers and storage in the back. Has a lift door on back for convenience. This car is recommended for families, campers and anyone who enjoys riding in a comfortable car. <br><br>
