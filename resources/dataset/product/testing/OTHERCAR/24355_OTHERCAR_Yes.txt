            I have to be honest, I didn't know what to expect from a 10 year old German road car with 120,000 on the odometer.  Heaven, in a word.  I bought a 325is with a 5spd.  It has all the normal amenities you come to expect from a car in this class: power windows, door locks, and sunroof, cruise control, abs, limited slip differential, and a trip computer.  The car is expensive to maintain, with a major service running in the low $500s, 4 wheel brake pads/rotors, $600s, etc.  But, the major components last, they are just expensive to maintain.

I have now put 12,000 miles on it, and I am in love.  Whomever decided on the slogan &quot;The Ultimate Driving Machine&quot; was right-on.  Around town, the car is nimble and extremely responsive.  I have the 168hp in-line six, and it is incredibly torquey.  The brakes are also amazing, linear, and confidence inspiring.  I have put a lot of highway miles on the car too, and the road manners are amazing.  I can pass traffic in 5th gear going up inclines by merely giving a slight nudge to the accelerator.

Enough about the performance, but isn't that why you buy a BMW?  The interior is nicely appointed, although fairly spartan, especially by today's standards.  The black interior is sporty though, and the leather Recarro seats provided amazing support and grip, plus comfort on a long drive.  The rear seat provides adequate space for one adult, although two might be a bit cramped.  The back seat is slightly higher than the front to allow the rear passengers a less obstructed front view.

All the controls (wipers, cruise, radio, etc.) are very ergonomically designed, and easy to operate even at 85mph.  Overall the car is amazing, I just wish I could have afforded it when it was new.<br><br>
