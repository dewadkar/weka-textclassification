            I will be honest I was just looking for a car seeing how it was getting close to my 16th Birthday. I was just joking around with my parents and we went and test drove one. I then told them that I wanted one and come to find out the dealer had a great millennium deal going on at the time and they got it. Come Christmas day I got it. I will tell you though everyone in town knew about it and you had people turning there heads left and right trying to see who it was. These cars run around $20,000.00 which sounds like a lot, but this car is AWESOME. It gets great mileage and I love to drive it. I got the GS and it is awesome I also have the sportstronic which is cool, BUT I hardly ever use it. The sound system in these cars are unbelievable. All my friends where trying to get me to put a new system in it and I told them that it was good enough. I had more people asking to see it and I even got on the front page of the school newspaper for the most loved car. I have rode in many different cars and this is the smoothest ride that I have ever had. Another good thing about this car is that is has color melted into the plastic on the bumpers so if you do get a bump it doesn't show. Usually the dealers are very nice at mitsubishi. I would recommend this car for all ages. This car also has door air bags in the GT version and passenger in the GS and RS. I can't stress how much I love this car and I hope that you take consideration into buying one.<br><br>
