            Although I don't own a Camry, I worked at a repair shop for 2 years. I will tell you this, if you can't afford a Lexus, the  Toyota Camry is the next best thing. I've worked on a number of Camry's while I was at the repair shop. The car is a dream car. It rarely breaks down and only needs minor maintenance like breaks, oil change, fuel filter, air filter, pcv valve, spark plugs, distributor cap, distributor rotor, spark plug wires and an occasional transmission filter kit change. The boss' wife, his brother and his sister had camry's. It is a great car. The only constant problem is the shocks. For some reason the shocks and struts are always failing. Most of the 1996 models and other models have similar problems with the shocks. Although it rarely have a transmission failure, if the transmission breaks down, you're going to have a big problem. In other to replace the Transmission or even rebuilt it, the mechanic will have to bring down the chassis. It's a long and hard process to change or take out a transmission on a Camry. I've done it twice out of almost hundreds of camry's I've worked on the past 2 years. It rarely happens, but if it does, be prepare to spend at least $800.00 on a new Transmission job.
