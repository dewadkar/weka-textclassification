            We purchased a used 1991 minivan in 1997. I had just given birth to my fourth child. We had a Buick and we had to ride elbow to elbow.

 I LOVE MY MINIVAN! We purchased it from a dealer with 45,000 miles on it. Now we have over 100,000 and we're still going strong. I would never own anything else. We test drove all types of utility vehicles. The Explorer was too small. Remember, there are six in our family. With our minivan, we can even bring along a guest!! Our car was made for us. There is plenty of room, my children are ages 10, 7, 5, and 3. We did have two car seats at once, and this still gave us plenty of room. Right now we just have one car seat for my 3 year old.  I like to pack a picnic when we go to the ball park. I just pop the rear door, and the breeze fills the whole car.  We can sit  and eat comfortably.  I go thru the drive thru a lot, too.  There's plenty of cup holders for everybody.  I take all the kids to the grocery store with me when we go, all of our groceries fit in the back.  I have even removed the benches and hauled trees, furniture, you name it.  Its like having a small truck.  We were also able to purchase an extended warranty with the dealer. This has been wonderful, I highly recommend it.  The only trouble I have had is that I need to get the brake pads changed about once a year. But, now I have lifetime brakes and that's no problem.  I don't know if this is me, the car, or the company that fixes the brakes.  This is an older car, so we keep an eye on the oil.

When I had my first two children, I drove a Camaro with a v8. After my third child I drove a Buick with a v6. (not much pickup). This minivan was a nice surprise. I have much more pickup and get much better gas mileage than with the Buick. The mileage is certainly better than the Camaro.  My friend drives a Saturn, and she noticed how much more pickup my minivan has than her four door.

Anyone who has kids should have a minivan. Anyone who has to haul stuff and doesn't want it rained on should have a minivan.
