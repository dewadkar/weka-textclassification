            The DC Zoom Camera by Kodak is definitely a professional camera, and really gives a professional performance, but it's not for everyone. The features are impressive, but so is the price. It has a 3x optical zoom plus a 2x digital zoom for a focal length equivalent to 38mm wide angle to 115mm zoom.It has a 1.6 million pixel resolution(1536 x 1024), and a 2.0&quot; TFT color LCD for review and preview, plus an optical viewfinder. There are four flash modes to choose from, and an optional external flash sync enabled, and it includes the 16MB Kodak picture card. It's fully compatible with Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and Power Macintosh, Mac0S 7.6 or later. It also has automatic OR manual exposure with automatic white balance. This equipment really delivers, but it's not for the faint-hearted..it's a 950$ model, geared towards someone that is very familiar with digital technology. If you're a novice-do NOT start here. If not, go for it-you will be amazed with the quality.<br><br>
