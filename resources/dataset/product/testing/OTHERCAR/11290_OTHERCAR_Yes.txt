            Struggling Mazda had a winner when they brought the newly designed 1999 Protege sedan to market, and it has been their bestseller since. The Protege hit the compact car sweet spot in terms of size, handling, utility, economy, and styling.

The new for 2002 Protege5 (5 door) is a triumph of adapting that platform to a wagon and improving styling and packaging for the price. The useful and roomy Protege gains even more utility as a 5 door. Mazda have done an amazing job in making it look good, and providing desirable content.

The Protege5 is easy to buy. It comes near loaded - power windows and locks, keyless entry, 16" alloy wheels, ABS, CD stereo are all standard. There are, in fact, only three major options: A/C, Sunroof and a 4-speed automatic. In Canada, the base price is just under 20K and with each of the three options worth under $1K you can't write a cheque for more than $24K to buy one (that's well inside $15K USD).

I selected one without the sunroof (my 6 ft 3 in son was too tight on headroom) and an automatic (my daughter can't handle a stick, yet). I test drove both a standard and the automatic and found the 5 speed manual very good, if a tad rubbery in feel. Handling in both versions was great -- more Honda than a Honda -- with the standard being noticeably crisper - perhaps due to lower weight - than the automatic.

The Protege5 can keep up with my 99 Maxima SE in everything but straight-line performance. Amazing for a econo-wagon. The Protege5 automatic rates about the same as the stick in fuel consumption.

I also considered Chrysler's PT Cruiser, the Ford Focus Wagon and Subaru's Impreza Wagon. The Mazda beat them all hands down in the mix of price/performance/utility and economy.

This car is an excellent choice for my teens to drive:
- great 5 door utility 
- standard 4 wheel disc/ABS brakes combo works very well
- fog lamps standard
- visibility, especially for a wagon, is great
- handling is so good that trouble can be avoided
- power @ 130 hp and 135 ft lbs of torque is enough without being too much for my teens
- CD stereo is good for this class of car, but my teens can't thump the neighbours out of their beds!
- teens are proud to be seen in such a "cool" set of wheels

Concerns?  

Folding rear seat design is poor and the rod and clip mechanism for removing the seat bottoms is flimsy. The floor isn't flat after folding the rear seat. While I'm on the topic, why can't Mazda design a place to stow the headrests? 

The standard tires are proving a little slick on winter roads, making a winter tire purchase a likely necessity if you live where the snow falls.

To my eye, Mazda may be trying a little TOO hard to make the thing look cool - certainly little is left for the aftermarket tuners.

At this price, you are likely to meet a lot of other Protege5's on the road.
