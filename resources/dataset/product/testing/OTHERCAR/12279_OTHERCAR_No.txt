            I guess what it comes down to is, buying this car served it's purpose, but I was suprised at how &quot;used&quot; this used car really is.  I bought the car in 1998, and it was a 1994 model year, and it only had 30,000 miles on it, so it obviously wasn't driven excessively.  The car rides as though it has 130,000 miles on it, because everything feels like it's rattling if you go above 40 mph.  The windshield leaks every time that it rains, and the car just blew a valve gasket.  I think that the next time I go looking for a bargain car to buy, I'll definitely stay away from the Plymouth Acclaim.  Maybe I'll have more luck if I can find myself a used Yugo...<br><br>
