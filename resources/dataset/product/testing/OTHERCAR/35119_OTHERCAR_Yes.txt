            I own the Olympus 2000 Digital camera,  but decided that this camera looked too good to pass up.  I do alot of on-the-spot picture taking, and what is so great about this camera is the combination of the Olympus digital capabilities behind the Polaroid printing.  

OK - so if you want a new toy - you've got it.  I was able to find this camera for about $600.00.  It's bigger than the regular digital cameras, because of the Polaroid print film cartridge you load (front loading) to print any of the digital prints that you want.  But this is the greatest - it uses Polaroid 500 film (on sale right now through 3/31 at Price-Costco - you get $12.00 rebate on one three-pack), and you can choose which picture you want printed.  You can even print a close up of the picture, off-center, etc., using the Olympus capabilities.  The zoom features, red-eye reduction, lighting, built-in flash, etc. are all similar to other Olympus high-end cameras, so you're not compromising picture-taking capabilities for the added option of also having printing. You can use regular batteries or lithium (the battery chamber is MUCH better designed than previous Olympus models), and can also be used with an AC adapter (all good)!  Also - this camera takes rechargeable batteries, which I would strongly suggest.

The printing works exactly like a Polaroid - takes about 2 minutes once the picture "pops" out of the slot, but colors are good, and although small (about 2x3), it's terrific to be able to give someone (or yourself!) immediate gratification of the picture that was just taken as a memento, or something to have fun with.

All in all - a combination of great Olympus digital camera capabilities with the added toy of being able to print.  I love mine!
