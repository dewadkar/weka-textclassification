            My father always bought new cars, never used, so our family was the original owners of a 1984 ugly blue Chevy Chevette with 4 speed stick shift. This was the first non-automatic car the family had. Mom had never learned to drive stick. After my sister's experience in the Chevette, mom never bothered to try. 

My sister was back from college and was very excited to take the new car out for a spin. As she passed through a major intersection, the stick shift came off in her hand. Not the knob of the stick shift, the whole assembly simply pulled out of the floor as she shifted into third gear. It seems that there was a problem with the linkage in the Chevette, but no one bothered to say anything about it until it reared its ugly head.

On the plus side, the Chevette got terrific gas mileage (and why not? There was hardly any car there to move.)

One of the biggest problems with the Chevette and with cars since then was that the front grill was made of plastic. When once in a small fender-bender, the whole grill had to be replaced. On the old Galaxy 500 that the Chevette had replaced, if you got into a fender-bender not only didn't it hurt the car, it sometimes started the clock.

In 1986, my father bought another new car, a Chevy Sprint. It looked like the Chevette only shorter! 

In the end, my father now buys Buicks. They're big and solid and drive that way. 

When a car has no weight, it can't hold the road. Lighter is only better to a point. It's nice to be able to park a car, but there needs to be some weight to hold the road and some steel to protect passengers. The Chevette was not fun to drive, and it felt incredibly unsafe on around bigger vehicles. 

I wrote this review because I just saw someone driving a Chevette this week in Tel Aviv. I was scared to death for him. It's bad enough to be in a car of substance in this city, but the Chevette is a lightweight in every sense of the word.
