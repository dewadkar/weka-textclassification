            When my husband and I first saw the Jeep Liberty, I thought it looked like one of my sons Hot Wheels cars.  But the longer I looked at it the more I liked it.  I decided to give it a test drive and immediately fell in love with it. It was pretty powerful, and very comfortable to ride in.  I had an Isuzu Trooper and the Liberty was longer and higher than the Isuzu.

I finally bought the Liberty Sport in Flame red with all the bells and whistles and I really love driving it. My son who is 18 months old enjoys the bright color of it.

This car is reasonably priced so the young and old can afford it, and it is not as big as the Suburbans so really anyone could handle driving this SUV.

I bought this car because I also own an '82 Jeep CJ-5 soft top and I love that car too.  The Jeep name speaks for itself in that it is rugged and tough but affordable and attractive looking.

I have only had the car for about 10 days so I will get back to you on the "Cons" if there are any.
