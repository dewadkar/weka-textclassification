            We originally purchased the 1996 LS 400 two years used, mostly because we had the opportunity to when it rolled off a company lease (the price was too good to pass up).  We've had it for a couple of years and it has a total of about 48,000 miles on it.

The Lexus is a true &quot;luxury&quot; car in terms of the class it belongs in.  However, while very nice on the inside, the level of trim simply doesn't come close to most European luxury cars and even some American cars.  In addition, this thing is a boat -- it handles sluggishly and takes about four miles to stop (so I exaggerate).  There is no doubt that on a level, straight highway, the LS 400's ride is as smooth as glass and the seats are quite comfortable.  But this just isn't enough in a car.  BMW, Volvo and Mercedes have shown that it is possible to achieve a balance between performance and luxury that does not significantly disappoint in either regard.

In addition, for a V8, this car is extremely weak on acceleration, probably due to its extremely heavy weight.  Even in 3rd gear with the overdrive off and the &quot;power&quot; setting on, a driver has to completely mash the accelerator to get any hint of &quot;rapid&quot; acceleration.

What is most surprising, given the Nakamichi OEM components, is the really disappointing performance of the sound system.  It is literally dead, often distorted and extremely weak.

Fortunately, the maintenance on the Lexus has been remarkably low and aside from the gas guzzling tank, overall ownership costs are not that bad for this segment of the market.

The LS 400 is a nice car, but there are much better values elsewhere in the same price range.

Happy hunting!
