            My husband and I made the mistake of driving a 2003 540i when we were shopping for an X5.  We bought the X5 for its AWD and "sport 'activity' vehicle" personality, but we couldn't get the impressive 540i out of our minds (or souls, for that matter!).  We finally decided to trade in my husband's very likeable pickup truck for a 5-series.  

The pricetag was daunting--nearly $60,000.  The sticker on the 530i was $12,000 less, so we test drove it and ultimately talked ourselves in to buying the less expensive of the two 5-series.  

Three months into owning the 530i, here's what we loved:
* styling
* handling
* quiet ride
* interior comfort
* Sport package handling (the 5-series without the sport handling is noticeably "cushier".)

Here's what we didn't like:
* The 17-inch wheels combined with the sport handling (the two come hand-in-hand) made for a rough ride.  Our car had the sport seats (as opposed to the comfort seats).  The sport seats have an adjustment to better support the underside of your thighs, but they don't have lumbar support.  The bumpy ride would have been easier to take with some extra lumbar support in the seat.
* Compared to the 540i the acceleration was lacking.  It was more than adequate, sure, but it just didn't have the punch of the 540's V-8 (not surprising).  My husband and I both drove the 530i in the manual mode of our automatic transmission so we could have more pull getting out of first gear.
* The stock stereo was decent, but my X5 has the upgraded, premium sound, which blows the former out of the stratosphere.  

We realized that we missed the 540i that we never bought.  Three months later, the local dealership had not a one 5-series on its lot (everyone was racing to buy the last of them before BMW replaced them with the newly (and badly--sadly) styled 5 series.  We figured we'd wait for a 2003 540i to come off lease and buy it used in a few years.

Not a week later someone told my husband about their positive experience buying a car on Ebay.  We took a look, and a 2003 540i M Sport with 8,000 miles had just come up for auction.  Not only did it have the V-8, but it had comfort seats (which, we discovered, have an adjustable setting for the upper back.  Adjustable upper back AND lumbar support--WOW!!).  It had the premium sound stereo.  It also had the M-series wheels, tail pipe, and trim.

When all was said and done, we bought this 540i on Ebay from a very reputable dealer who only sells luxury cars on Ebay (EcarLink is his business--written up in Forbes Magazine), and we sold our 530i on Ebay not a week later for a price that was thousands over what we would have gotten had we given it back to the dealership to sell on consignment.

We do not miss the slower, less-feature loaded 530i.  Even though our 540i has 18" wheels and the sport handling, the comfort seats are such a massive improvement over the sport seats that the sporty, rougher ride is far less noticeable.  

Do we recommend the 530i?  Absolutely.  But if you're looking for that extra punch in power, treat yourself to the 540i with comfort seats and premium sound.  It's worth the extra expense.

p.s.  Before you buy a used BMW from a dealer's lot, I highly recommend checking out EcarLink.com.  Read the owner's feedback from hundreds of satisfied customers.  We had a great experience, and we love our perfect 540i.
