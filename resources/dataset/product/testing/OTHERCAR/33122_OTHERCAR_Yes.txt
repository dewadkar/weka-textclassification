              I am thirty two years old , male , married with no children and my income is in the Audi payment range. So why am I driving a 2000 Malibu LS?
There are several reasons. Not least of which is the car is an absolute bargain. My car was a demo and for $18,000 including tax and destination I received a roomy , comfortable , and LOADED car. Literally , when you select the LS model there is nothing further to add. I find the 170 hp V6 more than powerful enough and I appreciate the 30 MPG I get on a regular basis plus the fact that it meets low emissions vehicle requirements.After years of folding myself into a series of sub compact cars the interior of the Malibu is a delight. Much more roomy than the Altima or my wife's 99 Golf GLS which cost about the same. The car has been 100% trouble free in the 11,000 miles I've owned it. Build quality is very very good. Long , bumpy , dirt country roads such as the one I live on could give any car a bad case of squeaks and rattles yet my Malibu has none. What would I change? The exterior could use a sprinkling of chrome. The new for 2000 alloy wheels aren't as attractive as on previous models. The switches for the rear defroster and for turning on the AC are a little flimsy feeling. Other than that its solid as a rock and a joy to drive. Foreign car partisans can keep paying $25,000 to $30,000 for their Camrys and Accords. The Malibu has 99% of their quality and all of their features for much much less.<br><br>
