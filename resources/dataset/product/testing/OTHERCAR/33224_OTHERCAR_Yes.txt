            Being a passenger in a car can be fun. I enjoy watching the different types of vehicles whiz by and one of the most common ones I see is some version of the Honda Accord. If you have never seen one on our nation's roads you must be too busy with something else because these cars rule the roads today.

As an owner of the 1997 I4 automatic Accord I can see why everyone has these. From a performance viewpoint, the I4 version is an above average car. I find it to have acceleration sufficient enough for me to get on a highway or to pass a car. However those speed demons out there might want to look at the V6 edition. My car does have shocks that could be described as only average at best though. A single pebble on the road would make one spill their drink. The turning radius is another below average aspect of the Accord. I find that simple things as turning into a parking space can be very difficult. It can also not make a U-turn sometimes because of this poor turning radius. I have not have had a problem with the brakes too. They seem to be good, not too tight or loose. 

The gas mileage of the Accord is comparable to other sedans on the market. I usually can get 19 mpg with a steady diet of highway roads and city streets.

Aesthetically, the Accord is one handsome car. The lines are very smooth and I like the overall design. I have never had a problem with the paint despite living in New England. The leg room is above average as well as the trunk space. The interior fabric is also very good. Although not too lush it is very durable. The seats are slightly stiff and could be uncomfortable for extensive trips. Since I live an active lifestyle and drive my 5 and 12 year old brothers around ( can you say juice spills?), I find this to be a good feature. The dashboard is well lit up at night and the radio has an internal antenna which is a good feature too. My AC is very cold and the heat is good for those harsh winters I get up here. My version, the LX, has power everything which is handy.
