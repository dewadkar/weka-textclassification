            OK, let me preface this by saying I'm in no way an expert on photography.  Frankly, I don't even belong on a scale in this category.  I did, however, need to get a camera and start taking pictures to remember places and people.

I did a lot of research online, and quizzed photography buffs about various cameras, and this one was the one they agreed would be good for me.  It's digital, but works like a SLR camera, which really allows me to grow with the camera and learn on it, all while providing me an excellent set of photos with very little knowledge / effort.

The display and navigation is very well done.  The unit's battery life is also remarkable, as I used it for 2 weeks before I needed to recharge it.  3 hours, and it's at 100%.

The camera comes with a 64 MB flashcard, which I haven't used.  I opted to splurge and get the IBM Microdrive so I could have a 1 GB HD in there, and I don't regret my decision.  Coupled with the longevity of the camera's battery, this would take all the snaps I'd want in a full 2 week vacation and I'd never have to worry about downloading pictures or fumbling with anything until I was home.  It's also gaining widespread use in other electronic devices, namely mp3 players, so an investment in a Microdrive is simply a wise move.

The camera is versatile, easy to use, and able to grow with you.  This is a safe investment for anyone.
