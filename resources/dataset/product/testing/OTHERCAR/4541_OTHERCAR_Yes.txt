            When I bought my Hyundai, it was a new make/brand of car, thus was somewhat of an unknown quantity.  I shopped around for weeks, looking at Hyundais, Toyotas, Geos, Chevrolets, and Hondas in comparable models and price ranges.  I settled on the Hyundai for 3 reasons:  price, the service warranty, and the options available. I bought my 1993 Hyundai Excel brand new -- my first new car purchase -- and cannot say enough good things about this make/model of car.  

First of all, the sales team was fabulous (though I won't go into detail since that is largely dependent on the individual and not the car itself).  Secondly, the service staff and the warranty coverage was EXCELLENT.  When I purchased my car, I got a 3 year warranty that covered everything except gas, provided all work was done by the dealership or an approved mechanic.  The warranty covered all of my maintenance work -- all oil changes, tire rotations, fluid refills, etc. -- for free.  When I accidentally blew out a stereo speaker, they fixed it for free.  When I discovered a small leak in the driver's side window, they replaced the window and all of the molding for free.  When I ran over a nail and punctured my tire, they repaired it for free.  Thirdly, it rides well, has comfortable seating, plenty of leg room in the front and back seats, and the hatchback holds a LOT!

When the warranty ran out at the end of the 3rd year, I was nervous.  I'd been &quot;spoiled,&quot; so to speak, and was concerned about the effect of &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; (everything starts to break the day after the warranty runs out) on my car. Well, I needn't have worried.  By the time I paid the car off, 5 years after purchase, the ONLY repair work it had required was a muffler replacement...and that was done solely for the purpose of passing state inspection (the muffler still worked well, but had a tiny hole in the tailpipe, thus wouldn't pass inspection without replacement).

It's now been 7 years since I bought the car.  It started leaking a little oil in the past year (according to my mechanic, this is not out of the ordinary for cars of this age), so I've  had the oil pump replaced.  Other than that, the car has remained virtually problem-free.  It starts every time, runs well in all types of weather, and the gas mileage is great (25-35 miles/gallon).  I continue to be pleased with it's performance and would purchase another Hyundai without hesitation.<br><br>
