            I purchase a Chevrolet Malibu after months of test driving several different types and models of mid-size sedans. I continued to return to the Malibu.  I am the father of two teenage boys as well as being a little league coach.  I needed a car that I could fit all my teams baseball equipment, I wanted a sporty sedan with aggressive acceleration and classic styling that would handle well and be comfortable on long interstate trips. I would recommend that you get the aluminum rims they give the Malibu a sporty classic look.  

The Malibu is a very comfortable car that is extremely fun to drive, the handling is great with the ride of a luxury car that would cost much more.  The Malibu is well designed with classic styling, the front seats are very comfortable even on long interstate trips, the rear seat can comfortablely fit two large adults.  The trunk space is gracious and the rear seat folds down for additional space.  Driving the Malibu is fun, the car can accelerate providing the extra power needed when driving winding mountain highways or in any city condition.  The ride can be compared to that of a luxury car, it is smooth, quite and handle great !!  When comparing the Malibu to other mid-size sedans such as the Camry, Accord and Maxima you will be pleased with the over all design, handling and priced several thousand dollars less you can't pass up the Malibu. The Malibu is great for a person who has a family like myself or the person who works traveling, the Malibu is comfortable, excellent design,handleing and reasonable priced you can't go wrong with this sedan.<br><br>
