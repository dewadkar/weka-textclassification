            I must agree with the majority of previous reviewers. I am extremely happy with my 4Runner SR5.  I had owned a small pick-up and was looking for something with more luxury and room.  I returned to the dealership intent on buying a Camry.  After talking to the same saleswoman (yes, woman) who had sold me the pick-up and describing my needs, she immediately said &quot;I have the car for you&quot;.  She lead me to three newly arrived, used 4Runners and after a test drive I, too, agreed with her.  I had driven a Dodge RAM pickup and a Ford Bronco and found both to drive more like a truck.  The 4Runner, slightly smaller than both, handles much more like a car. It is responsive and stable.  I love the height of the cabin, giving me a view above most small cars.  The seats are very comfortable and the cargo space in the rear large enough for almost any common demands I could place on it.  I also like the wind-shade-like cover for the cargo area providing some privacy and security form casual viewers as well.  Back seat easily folds down to expand cargo space as well.
I drove it from TX to Wash DC via FLA last year.  Good mileage, comfortable  seating during the long-haul.  I even caught a couple a cat-naps in the reclining passenger seat at rest stops. Again quite comfortable in the fully reclining seat.  Recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of transport.
