            I've been considering a digital camera for some time, and this one was on sale at Circuit City.  My expectations were fairly low.  I bought this camera and a SanDisk USB Image Mate smart media reader.

I am exceedingly impressed.

The picture quality is 1.3 megapixel, and looks absolutely great once downloaded to the computer. The camera is easy to use and relatively small and light.

The only real downside to the camera is its zoom function.  It will only do 2x zoom on the initial shooting.  But, you simply aren't going to do better in this price range.

I would say the smart media reader is a must if you have a USB connection. It makes downloading a snap.

I would say this camera is good for the hobbyist and home user that wants a solid entry-level camera without spending a fortune to get it.<br><br>
