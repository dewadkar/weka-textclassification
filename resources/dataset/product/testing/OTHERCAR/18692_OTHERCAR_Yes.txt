            The C-2000 Olympus digital camera is the answer to those of us who are purists - we love the SLR (programmable or manual mode) but want the ease of download without giving up the resolution.  I own 3 SLR bodies and numerous lenses, but this is the camera that I will take along for the ride (i.e., not serious shoots necessarily, but it's so easy to take with you - it's hard to leave behind!)

This camera is easy to use, easy to hold (much easier than others which are smaller with smaller buttons - read Nikon!) and yet has many of the capabilities of a regular SLR camera.  

One of the pluses of this camera is its optical viewer - and the fact that the LCD is protected (unlike many other digital cameras, where your LCD very quickly gets smudges and even lines).  

The biggest negative with this camera (unlike the Nikons) is that it 'eats' battery power.  You must purchase as accessories the ac adapter, an additional smart card (minimum 16 mg).  I would also recommend you purchase the floppy card adapter, which will allow you to download pictures much faster with less power drain to the camera.

This camera has wide angle, zoom and macro modes for its lens.  It has the ability to &quot;push&quot; the film (or should I say - push the digital frame?), and has other neat options like red eye reduction, TTL flash (built in), date/time option, I could go on and on.

To protect the camera - you should also invest in a camera case - you can get a relatively inexpensive one to protect your investment.  

Spend the extra money - it will be well worth the investment!  Enjoy.<br><br>
