            I was recently put in charge of purchasing a digital camera for the youth hockey association of which I am a member. After much research and being put on a limited budget, I decided to purchase from EggHead.com Surplus Direct, which is a refurbished and factory serviced catalog on the web. I noticed the D600-L and the features, compared the price and features to other cameras as well as compared the new price of the D600-L to other new cameras (Sony Mavica, etc) and found the Olympus was the best value.

I ended up purchasing the D600-L for $499, which is considerably less than the $799 new price. Once I received the camera, I immediately took it out of the box to find an Olympus standard extended warranty for all refurbished and factory serviced products. How great is that? I then realized that the 4MB SmartMedia Card that came with the camera was no good. I immediately called EggHead.com and Olympus. EggHead.com offered an 8MB replacement fro free and Olympus offered a 4MB replacement if I sent the bad one back to them, which I did. So, I ended up with a 4MB and 8MB card for the camera.

As for the features:
(1) 1.4 Mega Pixel -- AWESOME!!! Great graphics!!!
(2) 3X Digital Zoom -- This is a little weak as compared to the Sony Mavica, but a far better camera!
(3) Built-in flash, data port, printer port and AC adapter port -- This is amazing! Most other cameras only have the data port (for serial computer hookups) and the AC port, but this printer port allows you to connect directly to a digital printer and by-pass the computer!!!
(4) Software package -- The software package for the Camera is impressive. Olympus import software, Adobe PhotoDeluxe (which I have been told is a $200 program) and QuickStitch (a great panorama program that pastes a series of pictures together to make one solid panorama! simply amazing!)

Couple things to watch out for -- SmartMedia cards are very sensitive, be careful where you touch them. As with all digital products, I recommend rechargable batteries and an AC Adapter, this one eats the batteries!!!

My recommendation:  Buy this one!!!<br><br>
