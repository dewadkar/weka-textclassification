            I have owned my Intrepid ES for 3 years, and it is one of the best cars I have owned!  

I like: the space, because both rear seats fold down; the Autostick; the short nose (cab forward design); the ride; the durability.

I dislike: the cupholders get in the the way of Autostick; the tie rods seized which wore out a set of Eagle tires; the acceleration could be better.

Before purchasing the Intrepid, I test drove the Grand Prix, Lumina, Bonneville, Firebird, 3000GT, Eclipse, and other "sports" cars.  The Firebird, 3000GT, and Eclipse are too small for someone 6' 3" tall!  The Lumina is too plain, and the Bonneville was too expensive!  Consequently, I narrowed down the choices to the Grand Prix and Intrepid.  The Grand Prix has MUCH better acceleration and cornering, but the Intrepid has a smoother ride, more luggage space, more headroom, and more features.  

I am not disappointed.  Other than the tie rod problem, I have not had to spend any "extra" money on the car, and it does great in these nasty Colorado winters!  My next car will probably be another Intrepid (or a Prowler if I can talk my wife into it!).
