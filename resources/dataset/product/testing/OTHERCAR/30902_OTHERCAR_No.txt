            My first car.  That's supposed to bring me happy memories, isn't it? Well, it doesn't.  I was unlucky enough to have a '92 Hyundai Excel hatchback as my first car.  
I should have known it was unlucky from the start.  The morning after I bought it and took it to DMV to be registered, a lady backed right into the passenger door and dented it.  That little dent bent the door, and everytime you opened the door, it popped against the front/side panel and chipped off little flakes of paint.
I bought it when it had 43,000 miles on it.  By the time it got to 48,000, I had to spend nearly a thousand dollars to replace the transmission.  At 57,000 miles - it blew a rod - in the middle of the freeway.  It's sitting in our driveway now, covered in dust, until we figure out if we're just going to give it to charity, or sell it for fifty bucks to a high school student.
Sure, it got great gas mileage... but that was about the only good thing about the car!  It had no air conditioner, the radio sucked, the trunk is tiny, and being a 3-door car, it's a pain in the butt to try to get kids and carseats out of the backseat.  I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy.<br><br>
