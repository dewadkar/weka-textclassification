            I bought a 1995 Neon new in 1994. I still have the car with just over 40,000 miles on it but I am sorry I ever bought it.

I purchased it because it was cheap ($11,500) and fairly roomy for its size. It is physically comfortable but noisy as can be. You can't carry on a normal conversation at highway speeds without screaming. In order to hear the radio in the front, you have to crank it up so high that the rear passengers are in pain. 

The fit and finish of the car was mediocre at best except for the paint job which was horrible. It is black (hard to maintain anyway) and you can not wash it without waxing it. The paint clouds over after drying and can only be removed by wax. It is also so full of swirls and scratches that the dealer even asked me what happened to it. The car has been garaged and does not get a lot of miles so all I can blame the paint on is Chrysler. The trim around the rear window also oozes a black tar like substance even now as well. I can't remove it but somehow the dealer does. They must have a super solvent or flame thrower.

Mechanically the car has not been so great either. When I first got the car, it had a buzz which took a half a dozen trips back to the dealer to fix. I have blown a head gasket for no reason and have had to have numerous emission control sensors replaced when the check engine light has come on. The directional signals have been replaced 3 times. The best is when the clutch blew up last year. That's right, blew up. It didn't wear out, it just decided to explode. Of course the clutch is not covered under the extended warranty and as it exploded 250 miles away from home. The repair with car rentals and  hotels cost about $1500.  Now almost a year later, the car is making funny noises. I can't wait to find out what is wrong now!!

I should have spent the extra money at he time on a more reliable piece of machinery. Next time I will.<br><br>
