            1994 Chrysler Concorde (equipped with the 3.5L engine)
I honestly have to say that this is one automobile manufacturer that I lost total faith in.  When I first purchased the car used it drove like a dream, only after just a few months of driving did this car really show its problems.  The repair costs grew and after just one year of owning this car I had enough.  I traded it in for a good, reliable foreign car.

The advantages of this car are as follows: 
First off the car was very large, and it allowed for a roomy interior.  I am a tall person myself, 6'4'' to be exact, and it's difficult to find cars that allow me enough room to drive in.  I can honestly say this is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  There is plenty of room for the driver and all the other passengers as well.  Even after I put the driver's seat way back there would be plenty of room for passengers in the back seat.  This car also had a gigantic trunk, enough space to haul quite a large load if need be.  One excellent thing about this car's size is the fact that it was great in winter driving.  Traction was spectacular and people would rave how well my car gripped the road in sub par winter driving conditions.  The fact that the car was big and heavy, along with the traction control feature allowed the car to have supreme grip in winter driving.  In addition, the car came equipped with an Infinity sound system and for someone who appreciates high quality sound this is a great plus.  For a larger car the engine was very responsive and the handling was above average.  It gripped the road well and was safe to drive in all conditions.  The braking was relatively good for a larger vehicle also.

The disadvantages this car has are as follows: 
When it came to repair and maintenance costs this car was a disaster.  Virtually every few months something would happen to this car and the repairs were costly.  Transmission problems in this particular model were common, and my vehicle was no different.  The transmission was constantly giving me problems and it had to be serviced the most out of all the car components.  The car would slip gears quite frequently, it had difficulty downshifting, and the transmission didn't seem synchronized with the powerful engine.  I invested roughly $1,000 into having the transmission serviced and/or repaired.  This vehicle had heater and A/C problems, which were also common on Concorde's for this year, and I invested roughly $1,000 into having those two repaired as well.  In addition, my vehicle had poor seals which allowed water to occasionally flow freely into the cabin.  This was the absolute biggest pain while driving in rainy or snowy conditions.  The water would completely fog up the interior windows of the car.  Worst of all the fog would freeze during the cold winter days and all that I could see out of was a few tiny holes on either side window and the windshield.  The heater system was faulty and would not push away the fog.  I consulted with numerous mechanics and they agreed that it was in fact poorly constructed factory seals that caused this moisture problem.  For the seals to be refitted it cost $200.  I was also disappointed that the rear seats did not fold down for more cargo room.  This can be quite a pain when you are trying to haul a large object and are unable to do so.

All in all I can honestly say this is the worst investment I have ever made.  I would NEVER buy another Chrysler product again.  This car would make a great winter rat if you need a safe car in snowy conditions, but this is not a good investment for year round driving.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.
