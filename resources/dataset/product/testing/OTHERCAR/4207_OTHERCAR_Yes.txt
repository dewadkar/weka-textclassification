            We currently own a 1996 Grand Dodge Caravan, SE which we have had for about a year and a half.  It is our second one.

The first was a 1997 Grand Dodge Caravan, SE which my wife was driving one day and was broadsided by a Jeep traveling approximately 40 MPH.  It hit straight into right side sliding door, where my two children in car seats were sitting.  My son who was 6 months old and daughter who was 2 1/2 years old at the time, were in car seats in the front bench seat and were not even scratched.  My wife walked away from the accident as well without a scratch.  They were very shaken up, but physically unharmed.  The van was totalled and a week later we went out and bought another one with the insurance money.  We purchased the first van after much research on performance and safety and were very pleased with it's performance in an actual crash.

Both of the vans we have owned have been very comfortable and very reliable.  The only service we have had to perform has been oil changes, new front tires and an alignment.  They are very convenient with children and a great road trip vehicle.  The only drawback I have found is difficulty getting into the back bench seat when a car seat is strapped into the front bench seat due to the seatbelt blocking the way.  I would definitely recommend this van to friends with children.  <br><br>
