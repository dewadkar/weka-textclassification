            I own a 1993 gray Mercury Sable GS that has the 3.0 liter V6 engine.  I love my 3.0 liter engine.  And I sure am glad I don't have the 3.8 liter engine.  They cause many, many problems.  My Sable is so reliable too.  This car has a great ride and is very smooth.  After I got rid of my Ford Taurus, I wanted a better car.  A more reliable car.  And  that's just what got.  My Sable has a great paint job and that interior holds up well.  The exterior has two little scratches, but you can hardly notice them.  I get great gas mileage too.  I purchase gas on a Saturday and by the next Saturday, I still have a half a tank, and I work in Center City Philadelphia.  Since I have to travel such a large distance, I need a reliable car.  And that's what I got.  I know that when I get in my car, it'll take me to work and back with no problems at all.  My Mercury Sable handles turns very well and stops on a dime.  As I mentioned, my Sable has a great paint job.  The paint is very durable and has only two little scratches.  Even though my Sable has 110,000 miles, I've had hardly any problems.  It's just that my cooling system had some minor difficulties.  I had to get the system flushed out, and I had to get the fan switch replaced.  But that's about it.  Since I bought my Mercury Sable used, I did not know if it was ever tuned-up, so I chose to have my Sable tuned-up.  After I did that, the car is so more efficient on gas, etc.  Another feature that I like about my Sable are the additional radio buttons found by the dashboard.  When I drive, I like to listen to the radio, and change the radio stations.  Now, I can change the radio stations without taking my eyes off the road.  If you're looking for a great family car, but don't have too much money, go with the Mercury Sable.  With it, you get the comforts of a luxury car without the price.  Just watch out for the 3.8 liter engine, that has a lot of problems.  If you have any questions at all about a Mercury Sable, feel free to email me.  I'd be glad to help.
