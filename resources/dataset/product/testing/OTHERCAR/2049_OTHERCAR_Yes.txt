            Exterior

The Denali comes in six different colors.  Silvermist Metallic, Emerald Green Metallic, Gold Metallic, Dark Toreador Red Metallic, Spruce Green Metallic, and Onyx Black.  It has halogen reflector-optic composite headlamps and halogen projector beam fog lamps making it very easy to see in foggy conditions and in the evening time.  Two front frame-mounted Recovery hooks in case you get stuck in a ditch you can't get out of a tow truck can easily hook up his cables to the recovery hooks.  Heated light-sensitive outside rearview mirrors.  Six-spoked chromed aluminum wheels.  Roof-mounted luggage carrier with body-colored side carriers and black cross bows. It also contains a full size spare tire not some junky small tire which must be replaced right away.

Interior

The interior of this car contains four leather heated seats that come in either Stone Gray or Canyon Tan, to me both of them look very nice.  The two front seats are six-way adjustable power high-back buckets with four-way articulating headrest and power lumbar support. A leather-trimmed multifunction center console which includes a six-disc changer, lockable storage for little items, a zebrano wood-trimmed storage tray and large cupholders, plus rear passenger power outlets and audio controls.  There are front and rear air-conditioning and heat controls,  a 120 mph analog speedometer, tachometer, odometer with trip odometer, fuel level, voltmeter, oil pressure and engine temperature gauges with white pointers and blue backlighting.  A electronically tuned AM/FM stereo with seek and scan, cassette, dash mounted compact disc player, automatic tone control, speed-sensitive volume which means when the engine noises go up so does the radio.  Light-Sensitive rearview mirror with eight-point compass and outside temperature indicator.

Mechanical

This nice truck rarely needs mechanical work unless you are a poor driver, get in a accident, etc.  It has a four wheel antilock braking system, a speed-sensitive power steering, a heavy duty auxiliary transmission cooling system, long-life engine coolant {150,000 miles or 5 years which ever one comes first}, second generation On-Board Diagnostics.  AutoTrac push-button electronic active transfer case, which includes Auto 4WD, 4WD HI, 4WD LOW and 2WD HI settings for the different times of the year.

Safety and Security

The Denali contains drive and front passenger Next generation air bags, front and rear height-adjustable outboard seating position lap and shoulder belts, and center seating position lap belt.  A remote keyless entry with a panic alarm button, a Passlock theft deterrent system and shock-sensing alarm with adjustable sensitivity control, one nice option on this car is the battery rundown protection with retained accessory power and the lockout prevention incase you forget your keys in the car.  The last point is the OnStar Communications System which helps out alot in case you get lost, need a nice place to sleep, looking for a nice place to eat, etc.
