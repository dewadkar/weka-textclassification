            I just bought this camera refurbed off of Ebay for a $100 before I went on vacation in November 03.  I read through the manual once and it was pretty easy to use.  Since it is HP it interoperates well with computers.  It takes nice pictures outdoors, and indoors I took some pretty good pictures- but if you are taking pictures of someone who gets red eye alot- this camera will make their eyes look like a vampires.  I couldn't get bad red eye out with Adobe photoshop on a couple of shots (my cousin gets bad red eye).  So the pictures are good, nothing great, but with the 1.5" screen- WYSIWYG- so the framing and composition of the shots were great.  

Out of the box, the camera was easy to understand, even though I did read the manual.  I have the docking unit with the USB cable & recharger- which is a must on this camera.  HP kind of rips you off by not including the docking station.   They should be a complete unit, because this is more of a system.  With the docking station everything is easy- stick the camera in the dock and unload photos in less than a minute onto your computer.  Without the dock, your batteries will take a pounding.  

Do not buy this model as of this date- Christmas 03.  Digital cameras took a quantum leap forward since the fall and the ones that are out now are much better.  HP has newer cameras that I am sure are more improved than this model.  If I bought a new one I would go with at least a 4 megapixel (3 is a joke) and HP would definitely be a choice- but get the dock.
