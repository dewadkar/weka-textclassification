            First impressions of this car are that it looks great, especially in silver. To my eyes it is one of the best looking estates on the market, oops sorry, manufacturers don't like using that term, too many negative connotations, lets just say that this Avant, if anything looks a bit smoother and than the saloon counterpart, and has a much more accessible and practically spaced load bay. Behind the wheel all the controls have a real feel of quality design and construction, while the design of the dashboard and door panels is integrated which gives the passenger compartment a snug all enveloping feel. The car is well equipped with the usual electric windows, mirrors, air conditioning, ABS etc, and a comprehensive computer. Thoughtful touches abound, from the range of power sockets around the car to the key, where the metal part of the key folds away into the handle, to avoid it snagging when in pockets etc.

On the road it is very quiet and refined, soaking up bumps and road imperfections well, and the engine never sounds strained, although it is perhaps a bit coarse at low speeds. The suspension is setup for predictability rather than any sporting pretensions, although the enthusiastic driver may find the lack of feedback and involvement a bit disappointing. Overall fuel consumption was a reasonable 32 mpg, although with the car excelling at low distance cruising and load carrying duties many people may find that the turbo diesel offers a better blend of performance and economy. Overall this cars gives the impression of very high overall quality. With the platform and engine sharing philosophies adopted by the Volkswagen/Audi group, it may be that a car exists within their range which offers many of the virtues at a lower cost, for example the VW Passat, and I would recommend potential buyers to decide which matches their particular requirements.
