            If you have read my epinion, &quot;SMELLS LIKE BRIDGESTONE FIRESTONE&quot;, my latest adventure with my wife's 1999 Honda Accord happened yesterday, Tuesday, December 5, 2000.  My wife drove home on Monday, December 4, 2000, and said, &quot;Honey, the battery is clicking when I start it, and I think the battery is about to go.&quot;  After my experience with Honda South, I decided to try Braman Honda, located at 7000 Coral Way, Miami, Florida, to repair the car.  I drove to Braman first thing Tuesday morning, and as I pulled into the line for service, the car conked out. I asked two nice Braman employees if they would push me into the line for service.

Alex Ferrer was the service writer and appeared very friendly, and asked what was the problem.  I explained that the car wouldn't start.  I also asked Alex to check out the braking situation in this car.  I felt like a fighter pilot when I attempted to stop this car.  The steering wheel pulsated, and I had to hold onto firmly when stopping.  The car did not swerve or pull in any direction. Since I only drove this car once or twice a month, I really didn't make too much of this situation, as the car always stopped promptly.

Alex called me a couple of hours later and said that the battery was defective and would be replaced under the warranty.  He said the brakes had about 20% left on the pads, and he suggested I replace the front brake pads and resurface the front brake rotors.  He said this would cost $134.95 plus tax.  I explained to Alex that this was my fifth Honda, and that the brakes on all of the other Honda Accords I owned were not replaced at 16,146 miles.  He said this was normal maintenance and would not be covered.  I asked Alex what was the average number of miles that brakes pads would last on Honda Accords.  Not only Alex, but another service writer also agreed that 15,000 to 20,000 miles was the normal life on 1998 and newer Honda Accord brakes.  If you are thinking about buying a 1998 - 2000 Honda Accord, and you would like to hear it from Alex Ferrer, the service writer from Braman Honda, call him at (305) 266 - 0016 to verify the number of miles your brakes should last on most 1998 - 2000 Honda Accords.

On Wednesday, December 6, 2000, I called American Honda in Torrance California and spoke with Ron Robbins.  I explained to Ron that pulsating of the steering wheel in braking this car from day 1 was similar to a fighter pilot braking a plane.  I explained to Ron that I read the Honda Warranty Book and it said that the brakes were covered.  Ron also thought they would be covered after only 16,146 miles.  After I explained the story to Ron, he investigated with Alex of Braman.  Ron said, it was not covered, and said I should take up getting my money back from Braman.  I told American Honda that my problem was with them.  Braman was just an agent acting on American Hondas behalf, and 16,146 miles on a set of brakes was simply UNACCEPTABLE.  I wanted a refund of $144.25 from American Honda that I gave to Braman to repair another defective system in my 1999 Accord.

On Wednesday, December 6, 2000, I faxed a letter to Ron Robbins to give to his superior to ask for a refund.  Stay tuned to see if American Honda knows how to say LEMON or DEFECT.  16,146 miles on a set of brake pads is simply UNACCEPTABLE.<br><br>
