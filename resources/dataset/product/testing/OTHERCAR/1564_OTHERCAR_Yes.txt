            We purchased my van in 1996.  It has been a great family van with no major problems.  We have had the typical repairs but nothing that is out of the ordinary.  This van is so easy to drive.  Very comfortable!  Great for hauling kids and all the stuff that goes with them!!  We have the extended model and it has great space in the back for storage.  My only complaint is the seats are to heavy for me to remove.  My husband must do it.  The clean up inside the van is very easy.  The interior has taken a beating from my children and it still looks great.  It has all sorts of great storage areas throughout the van.  We have the 4 captains chairs and they are all very comfortable.  It is easy to get in and out of, even in the very back seat.
When I need a new van, I will definately buy a Dodge Caravan.  We have been extreremely satisfied.<br><br>
