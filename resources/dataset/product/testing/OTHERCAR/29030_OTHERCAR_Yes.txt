            The 2000 Honda CR-V is a good bet in the small, car-based sport-ute market, and worth it's $20K pricing...
In styling, it has good looks, better than the rounded RAV and more road presence than the Forrester.
In interior it is much more roomier than the Forrester.  I felt the RAV we tested was like a box on wheels, the CR-V is much more comfortable.
The seating position gives you a good view of the road.  You feel like you have a better sense of the road from the higher vantage point.  I did not however like the manual we tested (we got the automatic)... the shift on the floor was too low.
Performance...is good... it is a 4-cylinder and works extra hard on some gradual inclines, you have to play with the automatic shifting to get the overdrive to kick in.  Acceleration is slower than it probably should be, but it's not designed as a full blown SUV.  Since it's based on the Civic platform you get good carlike feel, and even some pretty good gas mileage... we've put 5,000 miles on it in 3+ months and have been averaging 25 mpg... highest has been 27+ mpg (all highway driving), lowest has been 22 mpg (stop &amp; go commuting)... Somewhat higher, but pretty close to the sticker expectations.
Storage... the tailgate has a neat feature (although Consumer Reports calls awkward).  You unlock the window and can access the &quot;trunk&quot; that way, or you can proceed to swing out the tailgate for full access.  Most of the time we find ourselves just popping open the window to drop stuff in or pull stuff out without needing to open the whole tailgate.
We used the CR-V on a 1,000+ mile trip in one week and had it loaded with more stuff than we expected without anything blocking rear visibility.  And it handled great the whole trip... it's a good size to zip in and out of traffic or some of the smaller parking spaces.
We test drove the Forrester &amp; the RAV and thought this was the best of the three.  
We had one problem with the rear shock, but it was repaired and covered under the warranty.  With the Honda nameplate, you'll have the expected level of reliability.<br><br>
