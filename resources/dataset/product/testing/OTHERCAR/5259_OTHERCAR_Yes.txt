            I bought a 1995 Toyota Celica GT new in May of 1995. Now that I'm almost done with the car payments, I can say that it's been a great car, and I'd recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for a lot of power. Everything about the car is great, but it is sorely lacking in horsepower compared to the other cars in its class (Integra GS-R, Mitsubishi Eclipse, etc.) The 2000 model (first redesign since 1994) has increased power (and a VTEC-like engine), which should make this a very attractive car. 

Fit and finish is, as always with Toyotas, excellent. The car feels high quality: solid, steady, smooth... It's a little noisy at freeway speeds, but then again, you are buying a sportscar...

I bought a manual transmission, which has been great. Torque is good, and driven well, the lack of power isn't terribly noticeable, unless you're trying to pass on a hill, or something like that.

It's not a car for big people -- I'm 5'7&quot;, and I have about an inch of clearance between my head and the roof. The backseat is comfortable for one person at most, and that person must sit somewhat sideways to have sufficient legroom. I have a hatchback, so head clearance is tight as well in the back. (I'm not sure what it's like in the coupe model.)

I love how the car looks -- I still think it's one of the best-looking cars for under $30k out there. The stock tires are excellent -- I replaced them with different tires at 30,000 miles, and I should have paid the money for the stock type (Michelin X-GT Pilots).

It's a great sportscar for someone who cares more about the quality and looks than power, and isn't too tall.  Toyota quality means it should be a good used car as well -- I have few complaints after nearly 5 years and 60,000 miles.<br><br>
