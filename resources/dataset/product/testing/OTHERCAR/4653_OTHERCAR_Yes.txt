            I purchased my 1996 chevy caviler two door after a very bad experince with a mazda truck.  I bought the vehicle because, mainly of the price.  I purchased a striped down model, automatic with nothing in it and I have never regreted that purchases since. 
     This car is the most reliable single item i've ever owned.  I live in new england and i've gotten out of snow banks and slush that have stopped most trucks, including the one i used to own.  It has never staled, broke down or anything.
    Despite my new job and increased income, i would never think of bying a new car because this caviler is the most increadible car i've ever owned.
     This car is best suited for single men and woman who are on a budget, because of the price tag, but also becuase you'll spend so little on repairs and maintance, plus, even the base model looks cool.
not for families though, or stuffy snoby people.<br><br>
