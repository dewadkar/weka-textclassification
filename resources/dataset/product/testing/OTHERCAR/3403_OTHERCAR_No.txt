            The 3000GT VR-4 was my dream car for 4 years.  I purchased the bright red VR4 and drove it from Wisconsin to Montana for a ski trip that week.  This car cost $36,000 in 1992, and the workmanship and quality of this vehicle was apparent in the sleek styling, power, and over all thoughtfulness of the interior, exterior, and engine.  

When this car was running I have never driven anything that was its equal.  The problem was that the car was rarely on the road.  This vehicle was a money-pit.  Every month something minor (less than $400) would break or go wrong.  Every few months something major (transmission, timing belt, wheel bearings) would go wrong.  Dealer support is virtually non-existent for this vehicle, and make sure you check the &#147list&#148 prices of parts before consulting a dealership.  I had experience with some local dealers over-charging for parts and labor on this car.  I don&#146t mind repairing a vehicle from normal wear, but after the second time the transmission output shaft failed I had had it with Mitsubishi service, parts, and their line of autos.  Currently I am parting this vehicle out (much like quartering an enemy and sending the parts to the corners of the nation&#133).  

In retrospect, owning this VR4 was a great learning experience.  I got the experience of driving a true Grand Touring vehicle, and also learned a good deal about auto mechanics.  

As for if I would recommend the 3000GT VR-4&#133 Only purchase this vehicle if you (1) have a spare vehicle to drive while this is in the shop, (2) have extra cash available for costly repairs, and (3) are willing to learn to repair this vehicle yourself.  

Addendum&#151
Here is a rough breakdown of the major failures I experienced on my 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4:
Wheel Bearing/Strut Caps $564
Tune-up $829
Engine Rebuild/Timing belt broke $5800
Transmission failure $3500 &#150 Really watch for this, it is the weakest part of the VR4.

I also have many, many other $200 repairs to total $15,404 over the course of 5 years.  

I hope this has been useful to prospective buyers.
