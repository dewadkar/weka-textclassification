            What on earth, you may ask, makes somebody that is half the age of the average buyer of this blast from the past to fall in love with a re-badged Caprice? Well -above all- its a Cadillac. That is a statement in itself as everybody knows. I happened to be lucky enough to drive one during my last U.S.A. vacation and I can tell you, it is one thing to see the U.S.A. -but simply another when you do it with a Cadillac. 
Everywhere you pull up in it, you get red carpet treatment and nobody phones for an authorization code for your VISA card. Valet parking attendants love you as much as filling station concessionaires and you earn SMILES from other people when you create a traffic congestion at a drive-in, simply because you get stuck in the passway with the car's sheer size. 
The Caddy can seat six in lounge chair comfort that, regardless what the outside temperature, stay mega-cool.
It is an American icon with its four-and-a-half-thousand pounds of Detroit steel, body on frame construction (honest!), a huge powerful engine in the front and drive in the rear. Exactly like God and Ettore Bugatti built cars in the first place. Two entire generations of Americans would have never imagined driving anything without these attributes.
Unfortunately (for us youngsters) they were the only ones lucky enough to do so. Detroit will forever deny us anything like it in future, having rendered everything along it's lines to history. 

Even more unfortunately, I'm not yet in the income group to be able to afford one. But in -lets say- ten years, you can book me in for an ultra-low-mileage original in burgundy metallic with light grey leather, driven by senior citizens as it will be the rule for these magnificent hallmarks of the end of an era. They will be dirt cheap wheels by then. I can hardly wait.
