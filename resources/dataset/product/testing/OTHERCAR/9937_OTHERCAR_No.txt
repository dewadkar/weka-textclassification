            I didn't expect much from this car.  After all, it is a Chrysler.  And I had heard nothing but bad things about Chrysler products.  Off the top of my head, I had a friend who owned a Dodge Daytona, had to have the brakes replaced 3 times in 2 years and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it... another friend had a minivan (I forget if it was Chrysler or Dodge) and had to have the transmission replaced even though it was only 4 years old... another friend had a LeBaron that had a strange knocking in the engine whenever she was on the highway (and she commuted 45 miles to and from work, so that was most every day) and the dealer could not figure out where it was coming from... needless to say, I wasn't too thrilled about hearing that my husband had just bought a used Chrysler when he first broke the news to me 2 years ago.

Well, I can't say that I have changed my mind about Chryslers in general.  But this car hasn't been too bad.  It's big and rides very smoothly (my husband calls it an &quot;old man&quot; car - although he was only 30 when he bought it, so why he chose it is beyond me...) I have only driven it a few times myself (too big for me!) but it handles pretty well for a big car, doesn't give you that &quot;floating&quot; feeling like some other big cars.  It takes turns pretty well, I live in the country and so I do a lot of winding roads, and it handles them without much trouble.  Doesn't have a lot of kick in the gas pedal tho (I am somewhat of a speed demon myself - no old man cars for me!  hah hah hah!) And as a passenger, I am always more than comfortable, even on long trips.  The gas mileage isn't bad for a large sedan - 25 mpg on the average.  

It is loaded with every bell and whistle you can imagine, and pretty luxurious.  It has a leather interior, automatic <b>everything</b> including window, doors, mirrors, and seats, an imitation wood dash (which reminds me of a the sides of a 70's station wagon but I guess it was a trendy thing when the car was made?), a/c with climate control, cruise control, stereo w/cd player... it even tells you the temperature inside the car, OUTSIDE the car, and what direction you are going!  

We got the car when it was 2 years old for $16000.  It had been leased and had 36000 miles on it, which he felt was average.  I'm not sure how good of a deal it was, I remember looking at Kelly's and Edmunds web sites afterwards and thinking that the price (which he was told was a deal that would &quot;expire&quot; the next day if he didn't buy it right away, of course!!!) was average, too (some deal, hey?).  And it's a teal green color with that gold trim package that you see a lot now.

We have not had any major problems, but plenty of minor annoyances (which I find common among most makes of American cars).  
* The cup holder, which works on a spring mechanism that pops out of the console, didn't work when we got the car.  It took 2 trips to the dealer to get it fixed.  
* The garage door opener goes into a small compartment above the console on the ceiling inside the car, and in theory you can push on the door of the compartment to activate the opener.  It only works about 50% of the time.  It would be easier if it just didn't work at all - then at least we could just take the darn opener out and put it on the sun visor like most other normal human beings do.
* The paint is peeling off the trim around the windows; since there is a large black trim panel toward the back of the car on each side, this is a VERY noticeable problem, and detracts from the look of the car significantly.  According to our local dealer (not the one we bought the car from), this is a very common problem on these cars.
* The air conditioning went on the car last summer, when it was just over 3 years old - I would have expected it to last a little longer.
* The water pump had to be replaced last year - ditto.
* The trunk latch froze shut.  Our local dealer guessed that one of the tumblers fell out of place.  To fix it, it would need to be replaced - costing over $50.  We have been using the button inside the glove compartment to open the trunk ever since.

All this from a car barely more than 4 years old.  And we have only owned it 2 of those years. So while we haven't had to replace the brakes or the transmission, I'm still somewhat disappointed in it, especially since it is touted as a &quot;luxury&quot; car.  

I own a small Toyota SUV, which is also a '96 but purchased new, and my car has been in the shop for less total time in 4 years than my husband's has in 2.  OK, so I'm biased toward foreign cars.  But my bias is based on experience, and the two cars we own now have only served to strengthen my bias.  Now maybe I'm picky, but when I spend half my savings AND go into debt for 4 years over an item, I want it to be of a certain quality.  And the Chrysler Concorde we own is mediocre at best.  That's not the quality I was looking for.  But it was better than I expected.<br><br>
