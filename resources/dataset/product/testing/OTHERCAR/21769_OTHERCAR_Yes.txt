            I leased my 1997 Honda Civic Coupe EX brand new.  Since it was the first car I would be paying for, I made sure it would be one that would be hassle free...I wasn't disappointed.  The EX is loaded with features, such as
*   Auto sun/moon roof
*   Keyless remote entry
*   Auto door locks
*   Auto windows
*   Power mirrors
*   Six speaker-stereo, including two door-mounted tweeters

Also, the Civic gets great mileage, with mine averaging about 35 miles/gallon - not bad!  The ride is taut, with legendary Honda suspension keeping everything in ship-shape.  No, it's not the buttery-smooth ride of a Mercedes-Benz, but the price tag isn't Mercedes quality, either.  Coming in at around $16,000, my fully-loaded Civic Coupe was a great buy (I tacked on a CD changer &amp; alarm system).  Other than a few new tires and regularly scheduled maintenance, my Civic has not seen the mechanics' garage.

My only complaints about the Civic would be the following:
*   The paint on the side panel-trim had a couple large (about half the size of a pencil eraser) sized chips within my first few months.  I haven't had an problems since (other than the usual wear &amp; tear), but I expected that the paint job would be hardier than that!
*   My manual tranny is difficult to shift into reverse sometimes.  I have heard this from other Civic owners.  It's not a deal-maker/breaker, but it CAN be annoying!

I know that Honda just introduced a new style of the coupe, the SI, which features a beefier engine, and promises more rev for your buck.  That would make this auto even more worth the money.  Hondas make great cars with good features for the price &amp; wonderful reliability.  When I turn in my Civic in a few months, I will definitely be leasing another Honda!<br><br>
