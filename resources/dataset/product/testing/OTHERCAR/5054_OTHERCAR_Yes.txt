            I sold my 1989 Subaru Justy because of the birth of my son in 1991. Biggest mistake I ever made!

The 1991 Mercury Topaz I bought when I sold the Justy had problems from almost day one. Unfortunately, because it was a used car I couldn't take it back to the dealerï¿½ 

We recently bought a used 1988 Subaru Loyale and we love it! Although it is an older car with many miles on it, it runs so much better the Topaz. I've had this car since September of 1999 and have had no problems that occurred since we bought it. 
There were some problems that occurred before we bought the car (ie: 9 gallons of water in the gas tank, simple fix the run off valve was rusted out and a cooling fluid leak), however I feel this was due to improper maintenance on the previous owners part. Had it gone in for yearly check ups this might not have happened. 
I feel with good maintenance on this car, I will have very few trips to the shop.

When I was hit last fall from a oncoming car (I was doing 35mph, he ripped out of a side street and hit me) I had very little damage for the impact we had. No one in my car was hurt. 

The only problem I've found is some parts are hard to find, like a stereo system. This car has a 2 part stereo system and although the Subaru dealer has looked, he hasn't been able to find me what I'm looking for. I've also made inquiries on the Internet and have yet to find a CD or tape player.

We plan to drive to Whitehorse Canada in the car this coming spring and I think we will be in for a nice ride.

Next car we buy will be a Subaru, as this is the only car made anymore with 4 wheel drive.
