            I really like this car. I didn't think it could compare with a 3 series BMW, but surprisingly it does. The cars engine is very similar and puts out virtually identical horsepower and torque so the acceleration in this car is very nice. The dashboard functions are also very practical not being too simple but also not being too plain. The audi A4 has taken a new approach to showing you your gas quantity by simply telling you how many miles you have left to drive and it takes the guessing game out of when you need to stop for gas. The control of the A4 is also like a sports car because it feels glued to the road at speeds of up to 70 mph but then its start to shake a bit. In my perspective this is a great family car or a great car for a rich kid.<br><br>
