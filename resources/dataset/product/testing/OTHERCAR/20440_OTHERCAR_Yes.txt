            As you may already read from other opinions, this car is great.  I'm going to talk about the amenities/options, since this is what I think the selling point is on this particular vehicle.

For one, the seat warmers are awesome.  I can't imagine, ever, not having this.  Windows down and hot seats on a winter night is the best.  

Heated side mirrors so you can defrost everything (including yourself) with a touch of a button.  

Right-side side mirror will lower itself when in reverse gear in order to get a better look at the ground when parking - I haven't scratched my rims yet.

Full motor seats.

Sunroof motor is auto-dial, which is a plus when driving.  Instead of holding down a button to determine how open you want the sunroof to be, you just turn this dial and it will open automatically to a pre-determined setting - this helps when you have a stick in a hilly city like San Francisco.

Visually appealing is the interior dash lights - the nice glow of blue is different and actually quite relaxing versus the norm.  In addition, the entire setup of interior seems to be very balanced and "feng shui".  

Negative comments:
1)  One electrical problem during the first month where the airbag light came on.  But it was resolved at the dealer's expense.
2)  Recently read a VW exhaust recall on 1999-2001 VWs from Bloomberg - please check with your dealer.
3)  One starter problem - they changed the starter at the dealer's expense.


Good luck!
