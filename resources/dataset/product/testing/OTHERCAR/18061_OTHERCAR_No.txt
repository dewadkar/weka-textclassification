            I bought this vehicle on 1/17/96 because my 90 Lemans was showing it's age.

I happen to drop off a friend at the local Dodge dealership so he could pick up the used car he bought. I was looking around and really liked the looks of the Neon and already knew about the SCCA success of the car.

Three things I I told the salesman, 
1. &quot;I don't want a red car.&quot; 
2. &quot;I don't want an automatic (knew the 3 speed was at least one gear short of acceptable).&quot; 
3. &quot;All I want is A/C.&quot;

What car did I purchase? A <b>RED</b> Dodge Neon Highline Expresso. Why? Out of about 40 or so neons on 2 lots, only one had a 5 speed maual trans. Options? A/C, ps, pdl, am/fm/cd, power mirors, tilt column, cruise control, 4 wheel disc/ABS. The car was a program car and had 3708 miles on the Odometer. 

I enjoy driving this car very much. The cars I owned before were a 70 Opel GT, 81 Rabbit w/suspension upgrades, 88 and 90 LeMans (handled like the Rabbit). I have put 135000 miles on the car (Neon)in 4 1/2 years, avg about 28 mpg, change the oil about every 6000 miles. Since the car was leaking about a quart every 1000 miles after about 95k mile mark, oil changes seemed to be a moot point, but did them anyway.

The following problems I have had with this car:
1. ABS light came on at around 33k miles - bad sensor, fixed under warranty.

2. Internal return spring failed on the turn signal switch at 40k miles.

3. Oil leaking at back of motor (headgasket) at 95k miles or so. Didn't replace headgasket til 128k miles, only because the car was leaving a mess on my brother's driveway.

4. O2 sensor failure around 117k miles, averaged about 18 mpg. Unable to  correct problem til about 125k miles.

5. Replaced leaky waterpump @128k miles. Not really a problem(did it with the timing belt.

6. Replaced the oil pan @130k miles. It was rusting badly (not all the way through, but New England winters can be nasty). Replaced with 97+ aluminum pan/pickup tube. 

7. Internal spring failed in the parking brake lever @135k miles (05/2000). I repaired the lever myself. A new one would have been $71
 

If you do buy a 95-98 Neon, make sure it has the metal MLS headgasket. If you have a Neon already, if it leaks and has less than 100k miles on it (lower the better), Chrysler has replaced faulty headgaskets for $100 - $250+ deductible, depending on mileage. If you are having the work done, the closer you are to 100k miles, the more i suggest you have them put a new timing belt on your vehicle as well. It is recommended to change the timing belt at 105k miles. they have to take it off to change the headgasket anyway.

If you are doing a timing belt (100k+ miles), I would also recommend you replace the waterpump as well. The waterpumps don't last much longer, and you don't need to pay for the work twice.

Until this year (other than extra oil)didn't cost me anything extra other than maintainance. Within the last 6 months, I hae spent around $1200, and that's only because I have done most of the work myself. I've had better luck with my LeMans(Daewoo).


Note: If you have to replace the oxygen sensor on a 96+(OBDII) Chrysler vehicle, save yourself the pain and replace the downstream (after catalytic converter)sensor(s). Why? Because Chryco vehicles use this sensor to help compute air fuel mixture. That's why my car was so hard to diagnose by me and my mechanic.


06/15/2000 Addition:

After working on many cars at my friend's shop, I have come to realize one positive aspect of this car. It is one of the easier cars to work on. When I went to change the headlight on my brother's car, it took me over 2 hours to replace. On my car, less than 15 minutes. 

On a car in the shop, changing a condenser (radiator for the air conditioner (same make as brother's car), took me over 2 hours as well. My car? I could change it in 15 minutes. Not including discharge/recharge in either case, which should be approximately the same in either car.
