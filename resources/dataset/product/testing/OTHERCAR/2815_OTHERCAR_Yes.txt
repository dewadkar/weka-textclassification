            This is the essential starter-truck. I've found it reliable (except for the electrical system, more in a bit) practically indestructible, and fun to drive (if a little underpowered with 4cyl. under the hood) - but now that I'm a truck person, I'm finding it's similar to owning a boat. You will always want two more feet here, another feature here, etc. You will start caring about these things if you buy this truck, especially when some giant thing pulls up next to you and you think, geeze, he could fit my truck in his bed.

Electrical system has a lot of trouble on this model, especially the windshield wiper motor, which I've replaced twice. Had to get a new ignition switch as well. Otherwise, with proper fluid maintenance and tune-ups, I'd expect this one to last a long time over 200,000 miles.

I dunno what they have to say about safety on this one, but I've tried to wreck it a few times, and even after a headon into a concrete wall, the fender still looks good (although it smirks). I also bashed up a dodge really nicely without needing more than a new mirror on my part.

My next truck will have a little bigger bed (longer) and some more kick, maybe a 6 cylinder, but for a starter truck this one can't be beat.
