            We bought our first Astro Van back in 1986.  They were still fairly new at the time and we decided it was the best for us due to the larger inside size of the van and the fact that it was built on a truck frame rather than a car frame. We kept this first Astro for 14 years!  We purchased a second one last summer and even bought a used one (1995) since we were confident it would last.  Our first Astro had very close to 200,000 miles on this past October when it went to &quot;live&quot; with some missionaries.  They continue to put miles on it and it continues to run great for them.  Other than the usual needs such as tires, oil changes, spark plugs etc., we only made three other repairs to our 1986 van.  All repairs were less than $300 each time.  We felt it was a wonderful van and are excited that we found our second one at a great price.  It already has 100,000 miles on it and we hope and plan to keep it till it is over 200,000 also.  With four kids and family living many miles away we enjoy traveling in our Astro.  We have a comfortable ride and with the higher seats I feel safer than in smaller cars.  We get great gas mileage as well for the size of the van - at least 20 MPG average.  
    I cannot say enough about the Astro van.  For us it has been a very reliable, dependable vehicle that we and our kids have enjoyed.  And the insurance rates are great compared to my husbands mid size truck!!
