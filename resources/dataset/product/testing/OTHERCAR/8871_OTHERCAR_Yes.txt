            In May, 2000 I purchased a Honda Accord EX V6 (sedan) in Montreal, Canada. 

Here is my report card on this automobile after 15600
kilometers:
 
1) MOTOR: The 200 horsepower V6 is another outstanding achievement by Honda. This motor is so quiet and smooth, 
that I sometimes have to look at the tachometer to see if
it is engaged. Acceleration is outstanding. A little kick-
down on the VTEC, and I'm passing cars (on the highway) asif they are standing still.

2) HANDLING: This car handles like a sports car; it's nimble, supple and the steering is very responsive. For a car this size, one would not expect such super handling. 

3) RELIABILITY: I've been back to dealer twice for problems:
The SRS warning light came on...the dealer replaced a faulty
airbag unit. The other visit was for four simple factory
defects, an example of which was a rattle coming from the 
back seat. I have not been back to the dealer (except for standard oil changes) since August, 2000! Imagine...one full year with NOT a single defect! Excellent reliability.     

4) INTERIOR: Honda should get an award for the design of 
this interior. The dashboard is ergonomic (user-friendly). All the controls are very logically laid out. Also, short people like me feel like they are sitting "ON A THRONE", because of the low dashboard. Seating room in the back is
very ample. Storage bins are everywhere. The center console
is very functionnal, with it's two-tiered design. The HOMELINK allows me to lopen my garage door with one touch.
The automatic climate control (on the V6 only) is very 
much appreciated....after one gets used to using it.

5) The trunk is huge! This is very handy.

6) Accleration: Normally, upon slow acceleration, the automatic transmission shifts smoothly & effortlessly. 
But on HARD acceleration, the transmission sometimes 
"hesitates" for a split second before being engaged.
This is about the ONLY complaint I have about this car.
