            There are 3 models for the C5 Vette:
Coupe-a hatchback with removable top
Convertible-manual soft top
Z06/Fixed roof coupe-most rigid/lightest of the 3 models

I have a Coupe.  Highly recommend the manual 6-speed (in 6th gear 75mph puts the engine at just 1400 RPM for about 30 miles per gallon!  Perfect balance of smooth ride and great handling.  There is no spare tire (to save weight and space.) However, the Vette comes with Run-Flat tires and computerized pressure sensors which can be monitored from the dash.  The in-dash computer is very handy.  It is able to let the driver know if anything is wrong ranging from low coolant or tire pressure to when it's time to change the oil.  The Heads-Up display is very handy and neat.  (Hologram-like display showing speed, RPM, and another gauge) Steering is perfectly weighted.  Engine is a little rougher than most, but what do you expect with 5.7 liters of high HP?  The torque is immense and it is easy to overcome the tire's traction.  The storage area is surprisingly large!  I ended up putting in 3 full size luggage pieces with ease.  Active handling system works well and has managed to save the car in unfavorable conditions several times.  The car has stunning good looks.
Quality is excellent, but would like to mention that the ride is not dead quiet.  Tire noise and road noise are noticeable within the cabin.  Interior pieces are not on par with imports in this price range.  The car is very wide and has a lousy turning radius, making the car seem cumbersome in tight spots.
