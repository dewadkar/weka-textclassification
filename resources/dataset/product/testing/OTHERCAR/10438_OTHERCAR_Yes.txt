            As a former Mini-Van owner, our family needed a vehicle with room for the kids, travel gear, and the occasional trip to the home improvement store all at a price we could afford.  A truck seemed the logical choice, especially when we found this one which seats 6 comfortably!

PERFORMANCE:  9 
The 4800 small V-8 engine provides for good acceleration and does not bog down in slightly hilly conditions.  It provides for ample power to tow a mid size trailer as well. 

COMFORT:  10
The seats in the truck are roomy and comfortable.  The seat belts are integrated into the seat and provide for a more comfortable fit for all sizes of people.  I also makes reclining on ling trips feel safer.  
The ride is smooth.  Overall, I find the truck to provide a more comfortable ride than the van I had prior.

GAS MILEAGE:  10
Not yet broke in, our truck gets up to 22 MPG HWY and 19 City.  Not bad considering how versatile the vehicle is.

VERSATILITY: 10
Whether we are taking the kids and dog up north, hauling a load of wood, stocking up at the home improvement store, or getting groceries this vehicle fits the bill.

ACCESSORIES:  10
From toneau covers to brush guards, this truck can be customized to fit the needs of your family as well as it does ours.

OVER ALL RATING:  10
We love everything about this truck and it has fit our needs better than a mini-van without the stigma that accompanies them. As a GM family member, we couldn't beat the price either.
