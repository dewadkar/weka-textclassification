            I love my Vette, but must forewarn anyone reading this.  A Vette is not for everyone.  If you want affordable transportation that gets good mileage and whose maintenance costs are reasonably affordable, you don't want a Vette.  Tires...  Nearly $200 each.  Other repairs can cost in the thousands.  Fuel mileage...  The Vette has a LARGE gas tank for a reason.

Now, if you can afford the maintenance/repair, gas, and insurance costs, the Vette may just be the car for you.  In 93, the LT1 engine became standard, not an option, and the ZR1 was outfitted with an LT5.  Also, a special 40th anniversary package in Ruby Red with a Ruby Red interior was offered in both LT1 and ZR1 forms.  This package will significantly increase the purchase price of a standard LT1 by 5 to 10 grand, but is well worth it if you plan on keeping the Vette pristine and only drive it furing nice weather on weekends in the summer.  If you want a daily driver like mine, an alternate color combo of your choice will server you better.  Mine is black with a tan interior and the color contrast is just fabulous.

This is the last year that the C4 Vette had a glove box as it only has a driver-side airbag.  In 94, they replaced the glove box with a passenger-side airbag.  And, while a standard coupe or convertible of 93 may not have the formal badging and pronouncement of the 40th anniversary, all of the seats have the special 40th anniversary emblem stitched in their headrests.

OK, what is my review?  If you can get one, this is a beautiful car guaranteed to turn heads and press you back into the seat when you floor it.  Just be prepared to refinance your house to pay for keeping this car in pristine running and looking condition.<br><br>
