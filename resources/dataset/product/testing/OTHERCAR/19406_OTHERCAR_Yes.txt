            Ideally, I would have liked to buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee when I went car-hunting last May, but our finances didn't quite stretch that far, so I decided to look at some of the smaller SUVs on the market.Consumer Reports had rated the Subaru Forester top in its class, but I found it to be more like a station wagon than anything else. The Toyota Rav4 was cramped in the back and the seats folded down awkwardly. 
But the Honda CR-V is an absolute dream! Not only is its interior extremely spacious considering its size, but the car is very well thought through and ideal for people who enjoy driving longer journeys and getting away from it all for the weekend. From the little table between the front seats that folds down to let you walk through to the backseats, to the picnic table that covers the storage bin in the trunk, this car has little innovative extras that sets it apart from the rest. The seats in the back are split 50/50 and have an adjustable recline, not to mention the spacious legroom in the rear.
Driving this car is fun. Granted, driving any SUV has a certain drawback by not being able to corner very well, and this one is no exception, but the turning circle is fairly tight and it fits into compact parking spaces without any problem. My EX automatic seems to struggle occasionally on steeper hills and will often go down a gear too early, and even though it is supposed to have an alltime 4wd, I got stuck on ice up in the mountains and ended up having to push, so I don't recommend it for any serious winter or offroad driving, but at an average 30 mpg it's an ideal car for someone who drives both in the city and on country roads. <br><br>
