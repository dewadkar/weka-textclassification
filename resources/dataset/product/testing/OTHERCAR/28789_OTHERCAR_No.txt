            I had been driving Luminas for the last five years or so because it was my company car and I had no choice.  I recently left my job and finally was able to choose my own car and get rid of the 1998 Lumina I was driving (I bought a Subaru).  I am very happy about that.  
 
I got my '98 Lumina brand-new and it came with basic frills: AC, stereo cassette, power windows and locks, and not much else.   Some of the positives of the car included a good amount of space in the front and back seats, and the trunk is decent-sized. The suspension was fairly smooth, and it felt like a typical American &quot;big car ride&quot;.  It was a fairly heavy car, it had dual airbags so I never felt unsafe when driving it. Step on the gas and acceleration was average.  Gas mileage was a little bit better than average, probably about 22-28 miles per gallon.

What I disliked most about the car was the steering. It always seemed to drift easily left and right on the road so you always had to pay extra attention to watching the road and holding the steering wheel straight.  I'm sure this affected the passengers, because people who sat in the back seat frequently complained about being car sick.  I know it wasn't just my car because my colleagues all had company Luminas and I always felt queasy when I sat in their back seats.  I would have been a lot happier too if the rear seats folded down for extra room.  In this day and age why a car manufacturer doesn't make that a standard feature is a mystery to me.

I didn't have any mechanical problems with the 98 Lumina unlike the brand-new 95 Lumina I had that broke down the second week I had it.  I went over a bump and it died and they ended up having to replace the computer.  That same car had to have the transmission replaced after only 35,000 miles.  You can probably begin to understand my bias against Luminas.

Since I didn't pay for my car, I can't comment about the value of buying one, but I know they aren't too expensive relative to many cars today.  If you get a good one, it could be an o.k. family car, but overall I wouldn't rate it any higher than average.
