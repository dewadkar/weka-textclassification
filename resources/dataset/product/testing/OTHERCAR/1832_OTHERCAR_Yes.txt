            The 94 Sable is my first car, I have had the car for about 2 and a half years now.  The only thing about this car that is bad is the Transmission, at least on the 3.8L.  It growled and whinned for about 20,000 miles and finally died at 120,000 where I then had it overhauled for about 1300 bucks.  Since then it has been perfect.  The car now has 144,200 miles on it and is running like new.  Since I have had it I only had to put on a new starter, and motor mounts, which have been recently, basically I think they did their job!!  The brakes where out fairly quickly but I was taught how to put on new pads and rotors myself, the whole car only cost me about 75 bucks for what would be 4-500 bucks anywhere else for brake work.  I just recently had the car in for a PA inspection where it needed tires and a new windsheild becaues of a crack, the mechanic said the car was in really good shape especially for the mileage on it and he sees no problems with the car, and FYI I am 19, I do not drive this car like a little old lady, I drive like a typical 19 year old I suppose!!  I have had the car for 64,000 miles 80-144 thousand, maybe the first half of its life was poor for reliabilty, the only thing that I can say is that after you have replaced everything once (which if the car has high miles it probably has been) the car is home free for 200-250 thousand miles if you drive it nicely!!  I would say buy one outright for 1-2 grand and enjoy.....I would buy a new sable if it was less than an Accord or Camry but its more money and its not quite as good as one of those two!!
