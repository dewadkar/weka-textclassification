            Granted we purchased our 1997 Malibu used in March 2000 but it took a while to see problems: a) this car was traded back to the dealer or b) reliability was really this bad to begin with and Chevy owners are just used to it.

I have had Toyotas, VWs, and Hondas in the past but wanted something a little more upscale.  This is our first &quot;power everything&quot; vehicle.

This car has the 4 cylinder 2.4 liter engine which does have an outstanding record and has performed well in it years on other products.  This is the former Olds Quad 4 engine.



The problems:

a) This car leaks like a sieve.  Water runs through the windshield (I believe) and through the sun visors into the dash then puddling on the floor.  As you can imagine, this is a problem living in the Seattle area!

b) The 2.4 liter engine has an internal water pump that costs over $750 to replace!  I'm still trying to figure out the importance of an internal pump.....

c) The car handles well for a mid-size vehicle but stering is sluggish and does not center well.  I do miss my more responsive cars.

d) The power steering groans after I brake and turn at the same time. It does go away after quite a while....

e) The newly inspected brakes tend to show me an occasional ABS idiot light.  At this time the brakes almost go away.... but you can still control the car...IF you are not on a curved on ramp or such.
