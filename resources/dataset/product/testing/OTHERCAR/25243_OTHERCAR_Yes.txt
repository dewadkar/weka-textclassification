            I bought my Celica in August of 2001, and I have had a great time with it. It looks great, really modern and sleek. It leaves a bit to be desired performance-wise, as it's main competitors have a 10-20 horsepower gain on the Celica. However, the Celica gets better gas mileage than it's competitors. I can fill up my tank and not have to get more gas until a week and a half later. The car runs very well, only a few minor problems to report:
I had to replace the clutch master cylinder, which ran me about $250. The car didn't pass emissions (it's 12 years old, I wasn't surprised), so fixing that cost me $200. The alternator needed to be replaced about a month after I got the car - $150. My intake hose broke as well, this seems to be a fairly common problem in these cars. If that happens, go to a junkyard and buy one, because Toyota dealers charge about $80 for it - it's a rubber hose!

Now, I like to race my car on the streets, and i have won quite a few races with my Celica. The car eats Honda Civics for breakfast. Hands down, every time. You know when you're driving out on the street and you see that Civic with the huge spoiler on the back, the coffee-can exhaust, and the clear taillights? I've raced so many of them, and blown their tires off, that I lost count. On the downside, there's not much to make this car faster. There's virtually no aftermarket for it, as opposed to Hondas, who have everything. 

Interior-wise, the car is O.K. The front seats are very spacious, as opposed to some other sport compact cars. The backseats are larger than most compacts too, but they're still small. An adult will have a hard time getting in an out of the back seat. The ride quality isn't too good. It's kinda harsh, actually. The shocks don't absorb as much as they should, so going over a bump can rattle your teeth a bit. Interior noise is somewhat loud, especially at high speeds. It's nothing to get upset about, but it is somewhat bothersome.

This is a great first car to own. If you're a teenager looking for your first car, check the Celica out. It's much better than a Civic, in my opinion (I've driven both), and much better looking. The car sticks to the road like glue, perfect for driving fast on twisty roads. I love it.
