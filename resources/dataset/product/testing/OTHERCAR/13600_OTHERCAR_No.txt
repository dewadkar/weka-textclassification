            I've wanted this car since I was 16 (now i'm 19). I bought this car late in Sept 99 and ever since, i always look forward to nice days. I always enjoy having the top down and letting the wind hit me. If you are looking for a car that will get you attention, buy a miata! They're cheap (used) compared to other sports performance cars. This car, no matter which  year will give you the feeling of a race car driver. I haven't had any problems yet (knock on wood!) which proves it to be a very trustworthy car for being 10 years old. Mine came with the optional hardtop which is great in the winter. The two cons to owning this car are that the acceleration is not as good as a true sports car (i have an automatic transmission) and that the rear plastic window yellows if you don't take care of it. (you can always replace it with a glass window).<br><br>
