            I shopped around looking for a four door car after I had my first child and realized that a two door just wasn't cutting it. I was looking at the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Mitsubishi Galant.  The Galant had all the things that the other cars had to offer, except at a much better price.  I purchased a 1998 Galant in August of 1999. I have never been happier.  It is roomy, stylish, not too big, and very easy to drive.  It would be perfect for a family with or without children.  I would definitely recommend this car to my friends and family.  I am very happy with my decision in buying this car!  The most important thing to me is that I don't feel like I am driving a big family car, that I lost out on having a nice vehicle because I am a mom.  I can have my cake and eat it too!<br><br>
