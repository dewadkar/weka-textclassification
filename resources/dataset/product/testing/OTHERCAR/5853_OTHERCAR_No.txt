            Dear readers,
  I'm just a friendly guy that decided to buy a 1996 Mazda Mpv for the family.  I bought the standard van not the 4 wheel-drive. I can't really say that I hated it because when I first set eyes on it, I loved it.  There was nothing wrong with it when I purchased it; the problem occurred later. It was a perfect family van with lots of room inside and a nice interior and exterior.  That was just until it decided to start shutting off on me while I was driving it.  I know enough about cars to know how to fix basic problems and I couldn't quite figure it out.  So, i took it to a mechanic and they kept it for a few days and charged me $500.00 to do an electrical check and install a new ignition switch.  Then the muffler started to turn bright red and hot. All these problems were a big hassle and expensive.  Finally I get a tune-up and everything checked out and take a vacation trip to Texas.  Big mistake! I ended up stuck in Texas and had to pay to get it towed back home plus a rent-a-car.  It sucked.  The main thing was I talked to three businesses in Texas and they all said that Mazda Mpv's were known for a BAD TRANSMISSION. Now it's sitting in my backyard with a blown transmission and a blown head-gasket. I don't recommend for anyone with with hopes in a Mazda vehicle like me to buy this van.  <br><br>
