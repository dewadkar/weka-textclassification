            WoW! What a blast!  We recently purchased our Sony digital Camera as a tax refund bonus, and already have about 30 discs of pics!I have used it for personal pics, as well as taking photos for business uses, want ads, sporting events... you name it!  The possibilities are endless!  Great for the internet auctioneer. Storing photos on Floppy makes it so easy to transfer to your computer! This camera is so easy to use our kids can even handle it. The features for different types of photos make it an excellent learning tool for beginners, and just advanced enough for more seasoned photographers.  The only set back we have seen so far is the battery life, if you use the disk tool to delete a lot of pics, it can really drain the battery, however you can buy a separate long life battery for it, as well as a few other accessories.I would recommend this camera to anyone interested in digital photography!<br><br>
