            This is a great car, which rides real smooth.  If you have a lot of kids or evern a few the Suburban is a great buy for you.  It gives you room in the back for luggage and things like that.  It also can help seperate your kids, if they argue a  lot.  It has a seperate air conditoner for the back so your kids can adjust the temperature.  It fills up at about 50 dollars and you always feel safe behind the wheel.  I think this is a graet car for big familys.<br><br>
