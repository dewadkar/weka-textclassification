            I owned a 1995 Pathfinder SE and was quite happy with the product - never had any type of mechanical problem during a 3 year lease.  The quality of that vehicle led me to purchase a 1997 model year Pathfinder - the LE model.

With the 1995 model, the only minor areas where it could have been better were:  power/speed and turning radius.  Both of those areas were improved in the 1997 model. I also selected the LE model, with smaller tires than the aggressive, larger tires that come with the SE model, which helps quiet the ride, increase maneuverability and allow a tighter turning radius.

The 1997 model also had slightly increased horsepower as compared to 1995, which did help.

Gas mileage is adequate for a SUV.  More comfortable than average for a suv.  Probably not the best bet for those who do a lot of off-roading.<br><br>
