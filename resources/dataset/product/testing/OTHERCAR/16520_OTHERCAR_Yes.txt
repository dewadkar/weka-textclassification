            Me, drive a Volkswagen? Huh? Are you crazy? Well, OK, I'll test drive one...I'll take it.

This was essentially my conversation with a friend who manages a car dealership. My Ford Tortoise, ah, I mean Taurus, was limping along on three cylinders and a transmission held together only by the sludge inside. I had passed one hundred and forty eight thousand miles, and it looked like passing one hundred and fifty would be about as likely as me winning the Texas, Missouri, Florida, and California lotteries all at the same time. Slim to say the least.

Anyway, my friend told me to try out a Jetta, and let me drive one off the lot for a day. The first thing I noticed was the lack of the &quot;BZZZZZ&quot; noise that I associated with Beetle engines. You know, that distinct VW sound, like a kid's go-cart on steroids. I was amazed, this car was QUIET. And the ride was smooth and comfortable, not at all what I expected from a Volkswagen.

The interior is big and spacious, with plenty of head room. The stereo and &quot;climate control&quot; switches are arranged in a way that makes sense, putting them within easy reach. The seats are comfortable, with plenty of flexibility in positioning due to the multiple controls for adjustment. The sound system is awesome, with eight speakers strategically placed. I got the cassette player, but I would recommend a CD or CD changer. I also opted for the power sunroof, which still operates quietly and flawlessly, with no leaks.
 
The trunk on this thing is huge, allowing me to keep my golf bag with me at all times in case of an emergency. I have room left over even with my travel cover on my golf bag. Unfortunately, it only has room underneath for a &quot;donut&quot; spare tire, not a full size. Additionally, the back seats fold down for increased capacity.

The main draw to this particular car was its remarkable ability to avoid the repair shop. VW provides a ten-year, ten thousand mile warranty, with all maintenance covered for the first two years. This includes oil changes, light bulbs that burn out, and any other item that stops working or needs replacement, bumper to bumper. My Jetta now has about eighty thousand hard-earned miles, and the extent of my repairs has been: One clutch (at my expense), one set of brake pads (my expense), and one radiator cooling fan (defective, factory recall, replaced free). Oh, I almost forgot, a couple set of wiper blades, my expense.

I bought the five-speed GLS model, mainly because the four-cylinder engine responds better to manual shifting, giving me quicker acceleration. I drove the VR6, which has a LOT of acceleration to it, but opted for the four-cylinder after a rate quote from my insurance agent. I'm glad I did since the four accelerates nicely; Anyway, I probably would have been making regular donations to the local police departments had I gotten the larger engine.

This is a great little car. It's sporty and fun to drive, especially with the five-speed, and gas mileage is excellent. I will very likely buy another Volkswagen when it's time to retire this one, maybe a Passat next...<br><br>
