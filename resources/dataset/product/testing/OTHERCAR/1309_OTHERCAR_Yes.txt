            I had test driven all the suv's around and had been driving the Jeep Grand Cherokee for a long time when I got fed up with the constant breakdowns and expensive repair bills.  I took my jeep to jeep and had it appraised.  They offered me a crazy amount for my jeep( really low) which they had been servicing.  They knew it was well taken care of and never missed a service.  When the original warranty expired I even purchased an extended one through jeep.  So I left in a huff and started to try other SUV's.  I landed at a toyota dealership.  After talking to the sales manager about the 4runner he offered to have my car apraised while he took me on a test drive.  I test drove the car and loved it.  The first thing I noticed was how quiet it was, and very unlike the jeep it really, really drove like a car.  When we came back from the drive my car was sitting out front, washed!  I couldn't believe it.  The salses manager came back from returning the 4runner keys and getting me mine when he handed me a written offer for my car.  The offer was $8000.00 more than Jeep offered me.  WE did soe negotiating and I told me I would call him back.  Needless to say I ended up with my 4runner.  It was the greatest move I ever made.  I would buy another toyota any day I ahve been so impressed with my car.  As a matter of fact my warranty is about ot expire on it and I am once again going to buy an extended warranty.  The car drives smooth, quiet and is an enjoyable ride.  The stero is great and everything works.  When ever I take it in for service, I always get a loaner, and the bill is as promised it would be.  The dealership is opne from 7am until midnight six days a week, and Toyota always calls me to see if I am satisfied with the service I am gettting.
I do have but one complaint with the car and that is that while the mileage is much better than my grand cherokee, the gas tank is way to small.  So while it doesn't cost as much to fill up, I am filling up way too often.  I am told that in the newer models of the 4runner they will have larger tanks.  My advice is go test drive one, you'll love it!<br><br>
