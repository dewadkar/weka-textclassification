            We needed a second car and hit the lots looking for something within  a range of $10,000 to $11,000. We found her on a lot in Lansing, MI., just before we relocated to Maryland.  She's a 1998 Chevrolet Malibu.  Her exterior is a color called Sand-drift, although I would have said light gold,and the interior is tan with marbled gray on the dash.  Personally I like the outside colors better than the interior - I think they could have been a little more creative.  

This little gem was a year and a half old with less than $30,000 original miles on her. She was in the right price range, so we gave her a test drive.  She handles beautifully and takes curves, hills and straight aways well. We opted to buy!

This little Malibu doesn't have all the fancy features that I have gotten used to over the years.  I had to remember how to roll down a window,  have to keep going back to lock the doors, but she was worth what we paid and will serve us well!

The Malibu does have cruise control, day runner lights an excellent little radio system, and cassette player. The visors both have mirrors (no lights). Finding a place for a drink will never be a problem.  There is a drink holder beside the steering wheel for the driver,  a mid-drink compartment for the passenger and a fold down dual drink holder in the back.  Typically cars I have owned (Corsica, Achieva, Sprint, and Geo) only had at most, two drink holders.  

The trunk of the Malibu is very roomy and makes it convenient to visit Michigan and bring additional loads (lots of space). There is a trunk button in the car below the drink holder, making it easy to unload the groceries when I get home!

All, in all, I think this little car will be with us for quite a while.  We have made several trips back to Michigan and then home to Maryland since purchasing her and she rides extremely well and is economical.
