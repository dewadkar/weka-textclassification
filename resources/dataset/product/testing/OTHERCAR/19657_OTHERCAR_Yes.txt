            I bought a Saturn for three reasons: great MPG, low price, the Saturn sales model.  Money is something I don't have much of.  When I crashed my old car, I decided to use the insurance money to buy a new car rather than a used car because I just don't think it's economical to buy a used car (at least, not for me).  I wanted a car that had great gas mileage because I have to do a lot of driving.  The SL2 has a low MSRP.  

Above all, I love Saturn's business model.  No longer do you have to haggle over the price of a car, go to different dealers to comparison shop--all new Saturns have a set price.  Why all cars aren't sold this way, I have no idea.  Initially, I was interested in Saturn solely because of their business model.  Fortunately, I found the car to the best choice as well.  

The way most cars are sold, with the haggling and the con games, disgusts me.  It disgusts most consumers as well, no wonder car dealers are going out of business while their online counterparts are thriving.  (Hopefully, all lot car dealers who use haggling and con games to price cars will go out of business--they deserve to.)  To buy a car from Saturn is to put another nail into the coffin of the old, unethical style of car sales.  (All consumers should support businesses for ethical and pro-societal reasons, not just for products.  Some businesses that consumers should support based on principal and not necessarily due to quality of product are Chick-Fil-A, Ben and Jerry's, Tom's of Maine.) 

My Saturn now has 20500 miles on it.  I bought it in July of 1999.  I bring it into the dealer for routine maintenance and take it somewhere fast for oil changes.  The maintenance costs are low: around $100 per 6000 miles (I encourage you to check this out before you buy).  So far, I've had no major technical problems, none, actually.  

One weekend, me and four other friends took it on a trip from Southern California to Las Vegas.  The three-hour drive was cheap because I got such good gas mileage.  Having that many people in the car did not drastically reduce my MPG, although most of the driving was on the freeway.  With the air conditioner at full blast, MPG is not drastically reduced either.  The manufacturer says the Saturn SL2 automatic gets 25 city, 35 highway.  I keep meticulous records (yeah, I'm pathetic) and I average 30 MPG overall.  I do about 1/3 driving in traffic, 1/3 on uncongested freeways, and 1/3 on surface streets.  

Another thing I found on the Vegas trip is that the seats aren't that comfy.  The backseat is made for two people.  The backseat is made up of two depressions and a padded division between them.  While three people can sit in the back, it is more comfortable for two.  If the three people are considerate, it can work.  

The major problem with the seats, however, seems to be that they are designed for short people (maybe around 5'5&quot;).  For people like myself (around 6') the seats can be tough to sit in for long periods of time.  With a well-positioned pillow, I was able to weather the Vegas trip with a happy tailbone.  For trips of an hour or less, I find the seats to be adequate.  I've heard that the seats have been redesigned for the 2000 model year. 

Driving the car is a joy.  It really is fun.  It feels powerful and speedy in speeds under 50 MPH.  Steering is responsive.  Braking is adequate; it feels a little mushy.  Due to the plastic body-panels, and the steel-skeleton construction, the car feels light and maneuverable.  It feels as if the center of gravity was in the very center of the car, rather than in the body as with many cars.  Instead of feeling like steering a building, it feels like steering a bicycle.  

The SL2 is a good model if you want air conditioning.  Air conditioning is standard on this model.  If you get an SL1, air conditioning becomes an option and so ends up costing more anyway.  I strongly recommend that you consider the SL2 if you want air conditioning standard.  (As with anything, this may have changed.  Make sure you do your research before buying!)

Overall the Saturn is reliable, economic, fun to drive, but somewhat uncomfortable.  If comfort is important to you, then this model of Saturn may not be your car.  For a general use car that's economical, however, the Saturn is probably one of the best buys on the road.  

(Just for your info, after taxes, an optional stereo upgrade [okay, I wanted a good stereo], optional floor mats [yeah, I know: huh?] and other expenses associated with buying a new car, my SL 2 cost about $18,000.)
