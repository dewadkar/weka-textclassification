            My 2000 Z3 2.3 was my introduction to the world of owning one of Germany's finest.  I wasn't looking for a fast car - at the time my other vehicle was a 1998 Camaro SS Convertible with over 300 HP.  I simply wanted something small, dependable and fun to drive in the summer.  In a number of ways, I got more than I bargained for.

The price on the Z3 is respectable; I opted to lease the car for 3 years and put around $6000 down to bring my payments to around $220 per month.  Insurance on the car turned out to be much cheaper than I expected - I'm paying less than $700 per year for it with about 10x the base liability coverage.  

The car is pretty comfortable, less than a month after I bought it I drove 1900 miles straight to Memphis and didn't get any sense of discomfort during the trip.  It is "peppy" and handled the rolling mountains on Tennessee at 70+ MPH with ease.  Storage room is lacking (packing 2 weeks worth of clothing and equipment in it for the trip was a task) but that's to be expected given the car's size. If you carry the top's boot cover and a passenger, you're pretty much out of luck.

To this day, the car is a conversation piece.  On the occasions I drive it (top down, visibility isn't so hot with it up) I get approached a least once with questions or comments about it.  People from age 5 to age 75 adore the car - great when you've got time to be the center of attention at the convenience store or gas station.

Just passing 18 months with it, and having traded the SS for a new 330i last fall, I'd have to say I'd choose the car again, but would have made some subtle changes to it.

First and foremost, the radio has to go.  After going through 2 sets of factory speakers (between straining to hear the radio in traffic and the sun baking them) in the past year, I would add the Harmon Kardon sound system.  I went with the H/K stereo in the 330i and it's positively insane.  Sport seats would have been nice, as the base seats with the Premium package don't seem to offer much lateral support when cornering.  The 2.3, while it seemed fine at the time now seems inadequate after 6 months with the new 3.0 liter in the 330.  If you're <b>NOT</b> the type to pitch a car through corners (you know who you are), the 2.3 should be fine.  If the choice is between the 2.3 or the 2.8 and you're a driving enthusiast, go with the 2.8.

The clutch, again drawing a comparison to the 330, seems too soft.  The 330 feels "tight" and I've only put 13000 miles on the Z3, so it's not any type of wear.  The traction control seems eager to kick in, and I find myself just turning it off when the weather's clear.  

Visibility with the top up seems poor - the plastic rear window doesn't help matters much.  It scratches very easily, and mine's already developed marks from just having the top down.  Although buying a hardtop from the dealership for it now doesn't make sense, it may be  worthwhile if your area doesn't have "beach" weather 7 months of the year or you can locate a used one. Aside from that and the speakers, I've not had any real problems with the car at all.

Bottom line - I love most things about the car.  I'm considering another one, probably before the lease is up.  If I do end up going with another Z3, I'm sure to choose either one with the 3.0 engine or the M Roadster.   A couple thousand dollars in options would probably have made all the difference with this one.
