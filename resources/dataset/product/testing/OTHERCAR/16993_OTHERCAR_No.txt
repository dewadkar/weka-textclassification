            I am fortunate to be able to drive the new 2001 Acura MDX. This is Acura�s first SUV in the US, and they want to do a good job with it. 

My father has purchased this vehicle and likes it. Personally, I wouldn�t have bought it. Since there are already plenty of positive articles on this vehicle (SUV of the year), I will focus mainly on what I didn�t like about the SUV. 

<b>Weird Seating Design</b>

It features a maximum seating of 7 people which is accomplished by middle and rear seats which can be folded down for more cargo capacity. The rear seats are difficult to get to and uncomfortable for any adults. The center middle seat has a weird way of storing the seatbelt in which you have to pull it from the ceiling to a center buckle to even begin to use it. To store the belt, you will need an object (like a key) to release it from the center buckle and store it back to the ceiling. I know another MDX owner who didn�t know what it is for or how to use it.

<b>Poor fuel economy</b>

It might be good for a SUV (if you compare it to a Lincoln Navigator), but I find it pretty hungry for fuel. It gets barely gets over 300 miles per full tank. This is based on mostly highway and some hill driving. I think this might be caused by a combination of a fairly small fuel tank (19.2 gal) with mediocre fuel economy. Since Acura highly recommend premium fuel and the current trend for fuel prices is up, you will find lots of trips to the gas station to empty your wallet.

<b>Too much dependence on the center console</b>

The onboard DVD navigation system is great, but if it is off, good luck in trying to find a simple thing as the time since there is no clock. Some of the A/C controls are integrated into the navigation system. If it was go to bye bye�

<b>All show but little go</b>

Don�t expect to do any major work with this SUV. It has a low towing capacity of only 3500lbs, and you don�t want to get those leather seats dirty. It can be dinged easily too since my father already got one by just a car door. Of course, what do you expect from the CEO of SUVs? No grunt work allowed.

<b>Buying pressures</b>

The waiting list should be lower now then when my father bought his back in February. Good luck trying to find a base model since dealers are adding in a lot of options right when they get into their lot. Color selections are limited because of the "take it or leave it" attitude a hot car gets. Many dealerships will still require some sort of deposit which you may or may not get back.

I know some of these issues are what some people will call minor, however you should know these things before going to buy one. I expect soon that Acura MDXs will be like the Lexus RX300s on the roads now� a common SUV.
