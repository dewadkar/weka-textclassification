            I want to comment about Integras in general.  The Integras are a great value and run forever.  I have a '94 basic model with 132,000 miles on it.  I thought about buying a new car, but every month that I don't have to make car payments is a month where I can increase my potential retirement savings or pay ahead on my mortgage.  

I owned a 1988 Integra before, but it was badly damaged in an accident.  Never-the-less it had over 100,000 miles when I traded it in.  With both cars I never needed to replace starters, oil pumps, ignition systems or even mufflers.  That is unheard of with practically any other car on the market! Use NGK spark plugs and your fuel injection system will be fine.

On the negative side, Integra air conditioning systems tend to need repair work around 60,000 miles. Both of my cars have need this as well as friends who own Integras. This is not a passenger car either. It is difficult to fit four adults in the car comfortably.

Integras are a good choice if you plan to keep a car over four years.<br><br>
