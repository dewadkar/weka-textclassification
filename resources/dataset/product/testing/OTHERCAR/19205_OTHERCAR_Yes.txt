            Simply the best camera I have ever. I went from camera to camera. Trying Olympus, (Loved my 2100 Ultra Zoom), Nikon and many different Sony models from early ones to more recent. But I always found myself coming back to a Sony and this time found myself sticking with this one. It just cannot be beat!
Ease of use, great image quality, battery life that cannot be beat, storage on CDR or CDR-W just cannot be beat. I can get about 75 highest rez pictures on one disk.
Dominating the back of the CD400 is a huge 2.5-inch 123K pixel color LCD that is found on all of the Mavica cameras. There is no optical viewfinder so all framing and previewing is done on the color LCD. When used as a viewfinder it shows about 99% of the final captured image so it rates right up there as being extremely accurate and its non-glare surface improves its visibility in full sun viewing. All information overlays and menus are highly visible on the big LCD without losing your preview image. During playback you can zoom-in to your images to check for critical focus or color and it's really nice to review a movie on that big screen. The color LCD can be illuminated by a back light but it can also be illuminated by ambient light when outdoors thanks to the solar window across the top of the display. Using the solar window and manually switching off the backlight whenever possible will extend the runtime of the battery as those backlights consume a lot of power
