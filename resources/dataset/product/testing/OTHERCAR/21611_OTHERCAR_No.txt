            My relationship with our 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited is indeed a Love - Hate thing. Fully equipped with the up-country and towing package, V8 and all the trimmings, our Jeep has now been with our family for 85,000+ miles. Our work is video production, seven days a week and often  out of town with lots of equipment... so this is not a "carry the kids to daycare and the wife to the grocery store twice a week" vehicle. Our Jeep earns it's keep. And for most of the time, it has earned it's keep with good performance, dependable service, comfortable but solid ride, and the famous ability to take you places you would never return from in another car. Most of the time.

No argument here that the vehicle is great for utility, ride, capacity, towing, power, safety, and amenities. We have, however, experienced several serious negatives with the Jeep, with Chrysler Corporate in dealing with those problems, and with our local dealership where we made our purchase (we now take the car 30 minutes across town for dealership service visits). In order of appearance:
1) The Jeep we were initially delivered had a defective seal at the base of it's windshield causing any water... like rain... to pour through the dash, soak all of the electronics, and drip out into the front floorboards. In the second week of ownership I drove through a carwash and proceeded straight to the dealership with over an inch of standing water in the passenger front floor... just to counter the argument I was getting that it "couldn't be that bad and after all, a little water couldn't harm the electronics that controlled the entire vehicle". Honest - that was the dealership's response. I had to literally allow water from the interior to slosh onto the service manager's shoes before they would admit that I didn't have a car-salesman's sense of imagination with the truth about this submarine with a screen door. 

Only when there was no other recourse except to go to court for satisfaction did the dealership talk to Chrysler and get a new vehicle for me. But the dealership still made sure that they made additional profit from my misfortune. They wouldn't simply trade vehicles... they required that I trade in the soggy one that I had had for three months (while they were denying that nothing was wrong), take the depreciation, give up a portion of what I had paid for the vehicle so far, pay for the transfer of tag and title, and accept a percentage point higher rate of interest on the financing! Yes, I was required to re-apply for financing on a vehicle that was being traded.

The dealership claims to this day that there was nothing wrong with the Jeep I traded... regardless of the fact that the new one has never leaked, even in the carwash. And of course they sold that leaky one for another profit besides the "we moved another unit this month" they got for my replacement Jeep.

On a lighter note: The transmission began slipping within one month of the expiration of the warranty. No help from Chrysler. The reverse gear is out of adjustment and requires you to race the engine in neutral and slip it into reverse... with success about half of the time. This problem began on the day that the dealership serviced the vehicle to deal with a service bulletin to retrofit/install a safety interlock that prevents shifting the car into reverse from park unless you have your foot on the brake pedal. Well... it's safe alright! Now it won't go into reverse at all! The dealership has offered to repair our transmission for as little as $600, what they claimed was labor only and that Chrysler was generously going to donate the parts for the repair as a gesture of good-will. My gut feeling, with no evidence except past performance and occasions of outright deception to go on, tells me that Chrysler was never contacted and the dealership knows that they need no parts - only a cable adjustment (that other mechanics have told me would clear up the problem) - that will take only a few minutes and $600 of my dollars.

Now the electronics are going... windows will roll down today and not tomorrow. A window will roll down but not up for days on end. (One fuse for all, so it's not the fuse or the switches I checked with a multi-tester).

Both front CV joints (translate: axles) have been replaced with no off-road action to contribute to their demise after only about 70,000 miles and 5 years use.

All plastic interior parts are looking really cheap and ratty now in their 6th year of use with worn areas where hands regularly go to (try and) operate window switches.

The carpet is pulling out from the edges of plastic trim and center console areas... where it seemed to tuck in quite nicely years ago. Almost like it's gotten wet and shrunk a tad bit - but no, the submarine was the first Jeep, not this one that we made payments on for 3 extra months.

There had been a really irritating rattle since the second year of ownership. The culprit is a piece of trim plastic not quite fitting properly on the right rear doorpost behind the head of the passenger seat where the shoulder harness mounts. Nothing we've tried has silenced the constant "buzzz".

And whoever decided that it was a good idea to detract from cargo space in order to protect the spare tire from the elements? We have our spare safely protected... in our garage where it has lived for all 5+ years of ownership, except when heading out-of-town on the highway.

For the used-car shopper wanting a deal on a high-end Jeep Grand Cherokee from '94 '95 '96... I'd beware of our experiences. I understand that Chrysler may have addressed most of these issues in the newer models... but I won't be convinced for three or so more years. The dealership complaints are seemingly isolated and should not affect most readers.

I still love the safety, utility, and sturdy ride. I appreciate the power when merging with traffic. I am definitely proud of the stylish appearance and corporate stature of owning such a popular sport-ute. I just wish I could have my cake and drive it too!
