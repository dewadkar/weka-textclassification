            I am a first time MB buyer so this was an interesting experience. I got the C320 with the sports package and I think another option to get me the rear window shade and sunroof. The sticker price was $41K. The C320 is the hottest car for 2001. The style blows the doors off of any car in the price range and above. There are so many amenities and features that the post sale car introduction is mandatory and you have to pay attention to get it all. Even then you have to read the owner�s manual to truly know how to use everything. Here are some of the highlights of the car,

SOS � Onboard phone with integrated GPS that connects you to an emergency operator. It is similar to the OnStar system.

Four years free maintenance with complementary loaner car for long service periods.

Lifetime roadside assistance.

Excellent automatic transmission with manual override. 

Computer system is feature rich and even tells you when to take the car in for a service.

The power seats with memory is a great. Your key memorizes your position and automatically adjusts when you start the car.

Special hooks for child seats.

Excellent road handling.

Dual climate zones.

Very easy to go fast...be careful.





Although the C320 is the hottest car on the market I still have some suggestions for improvement. I bought an Acura TL at the same time so my comparison is mainly between the two cars. 

The 3.2 liter engine is strong for the C320 but the Acura delivers a little more power with the same size engine. Still the C320 is a joy to drive in and will push you back into the seat when you step on the gas.

No CD player! For $41K you would think this would be a standard option. MB makes you buy it from the dealer for $999. The cell phone option is another $600 or something like that. Also they have a proprietary wiring system so it is very difficult to get an after market system that works properly.

The seats are not as plush as they could be. They are typical MB hard seats without lumbar support.

The stereo system in general is not as good as the Acura�s sound system.

If you are in the market for a new �sporty� car, this is the one. It is the best looking car on the road; the fit and finish is outstanding, and it is a joy to drive. Watch out for the options because they can quickly drive up the MSRP.
