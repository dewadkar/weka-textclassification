            The Hewlett Packard C30 camera may not be the best digital camera, but you definitely get your money's worth out of it.

The first thing you'll notice about this camera is it's compact size.  At first glance, you may not realize that it is a digital camera.  It connects to your computer via cables (which are supplied), and to transfer 20 pictures it only takes a couple of minutes.  

This camera features a color display on the back, although it is VERY small.  It serves it's purpose though.  Other features include zooming, and choices of image size.

The pictures are stored on small disks that go inside of the camera.  They are not standard floppy disks so they can't be put in your computer - you must use the cables supplied, which means unless you carry the cables with you - you can't just plug it into any computer.

The picture quality is decent, but sometimes a bit blurry.  This camera is a little difficult to hold stationary, and makes taking pictures in the field a little more trouble than they should be.

Also, the battery does not seem to last long at all in these cameras.  At my work, we have two of them, and we are constantly having to recharge the thing.  If you're going on a trip, be sure to bring extra batteries!<br><br>
