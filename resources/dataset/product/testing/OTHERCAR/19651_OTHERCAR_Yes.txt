            I am the proud owner of a 1999 Saturn SL1. I bought it new and I am very happy with it! I have the 4-door sedan type and had been looking for a new vehicle I not only could afford but dependability was a big factor on my purchase as well. I shopped around for months, did research and I can honestly say the Saturn dealership was wonderful! Their concern was for me to get what I wanted,in a price range I would be comfortable with and  be happy with my decisions, not to sell me what I couldn't afford. 

I choose to get the power package which included power windows, locks with an alarm system and an upgrade on the rack and pinion steering, I had back surgery and the regular rack and pinion was too much for me to handle comfortably. The alarm system isn't one of those that get set off by any little movement of the car, but rather one that disables the starting system so even if someone broke into the car they couldn't drive away in it. The exterior is very neat and a little sporty, something I was definitely looking for. The interior is set up very conveniently, all controls are easily within my reach. Plenty of room for my family of 5. It also has a large enough trunk for my weekend excursions out of state and the kids are comfortable for the trip as well, very important to me!

I was so happy with my car that my sister went out and bought one identical to mine! So yes, I would and have recommended it to a friend/family member. I also purchased the extended warranty that includes a bumper to bumper and 60,000 miles coverage, which they worked into my monthly payments. This even includes my oil changes every 3,000 miles. The Saturn company is like family, they remember your name and are so friendly that I enjoy going to see them!

A very dependable car that gives me great gas mileage! The insurance on a car like this is very affordable as well. Great for a first time car buyer or for the family on a budget. See you on the road..........zoom!<br><br>
