                Back in 1998, Motor Trend picked the ML320 as its SUV of the year.  Many car magazines were talking about how Mercedes could have marketed this in the $45,000-$50,000 price range.  Reviews praised the car over and over again yet recently the car has been experiencing subpar reviews from many car magazines.  The ML320 does not live up to the Mercedes name.  Though some of the praises the the reviewers lavished on the ML320 were well deserved, but many were just praises of the Mercedes name, not the car. I myself drive a Toyota 4Runner and I have also had experience with Lexus RX300s, Nissan Pathfinders, Mistubishi Monteros, and Isuzu Rodeos, so I will be basing my review on these experiences. 

    One of my friends owns one of these vehicles and I have had the oppertunity to drive one of these on a seperate occasion.  I found the vehicle to be under the Mercedes Benz standard.  I found that many of the parts were either flimsy, defective, or easily broken.  There is nothing majorly wrong with the ML at all, but it is the little things.  For example, the emergency light button broke after about 3 months on my friends car.  Also, a piece of plastic broke off the back seat, and the cup holder in front snapped off after a slight bump.  I also found numerous little squeaks in the car which is disappointing for a Mercedes.  My theory on this is that in order for Mercedes to produce the ML at the current price tag Mercedes had to cut back on a few small things. I've also heard that there was a recall on the ML for numerous reasons, which does not really inspire confidence in the reliability of the ML.    
Quality: 5 out of 10
    
    After driving the ML320 around I found the car much more of a pleasure to drive than all of the other SUV's I've been in with the exception of the RX300.  The ride is smoother, the engine is decent, and other than the squeaks the road noise is pretty dead. The ML corners better than some SUVs, and the engine provides enough power, though the 10.3 0-60 mph is not all that great.  
Drive:  8 out of 10

    The ML also provides very nice comfort and cargo space.  The rear seats are very nice, as are the fronts.  5 people could fit into the car comfortably. The leather feels nice and there is plenty of leg room for both the passengers and the driver.  In the rear there is also plenty of room for cargo.  The seats fold down very nicely, but there is a small gap between the start of the rear cargo area the seats, so Mercedes bridged it with 3 plastic panels, which could be a problem at times.  Once the seats have been folded down there is ample room for everything you want to haul in a car.
Comfort and Cargo: 7 out of 10

   The ML could have been a really nice car but the problem is that Mercedes just slapped a couple of badly made pieces into a SUV that looks like a van.  I would recommend buying the new Acura MDX, a Lexus RX300, or almost any minivan if you are looking for cargo space.  If you do have your heart set on this car then I would recommend researching more about the reliabilty of the car.  I hope this helped!
Overall:  6 out of 10 <br><br>
