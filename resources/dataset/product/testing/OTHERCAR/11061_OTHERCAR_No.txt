            My 1995 Mercury Mystique was my first new car ever purchased, and I have to say that it has been the best car that I have ever driven.  1995 was the first model year that the Mystique was offered, and everyone told me that I was crazy to be buying a car that had no proven track record.  As a matter of fact, the car had been recalled before I was even able to take it home!  The minor recall was fixed, and I haven't looked back yet!  The car now has over 70K miles on it, and it still has a smooth ride.  In the 5 years that I have had it, it has undergone only standard wear and tear type service. and I am sorry to hear that Mercury will no longer be offering the Mercury Mystique as a new car option.<br><br>
