            You can read the other people's reviews for how the car handles so nicely, is very fast, gets a lot of attention, seats five comfortably, has more creature comforts than most cars twice the price, is relatively inexpensive, looks great, is extremely safe for its occupants, has a very good standing in the media, and is very cheap to insure.  But what I wanted to tell you is something a bit different.

You see, for less than $1,000 (US) you can modify your Grand Prix GTP (or Buick Regal GS for that matter) to have almost 300HP and 350lb-ft of torque.  Yes, THREE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER.  All you need is a 3.4&quot; pulley for the supercharger ($250 if you include the tools to do the swap), a cat-back exhaust system ($500 for a Borla or about $300 for a custom job), and a cold air intake ($250 for a nice one).  All three are easy to install (bolt-on) and together increase the car's output by GOBS of power.

Consider how it feels to rush from 0-60 in near 5 seconds flat - not 6.5 or 6.2 like a stock GTP or GS (which is fast - don't get me wrong) and finish the 1/4 mile in 13.7 seconds at over 100MPH.  Yes, the car gets to over 100MPH in less than 14 seconds.  How many V6's can you do THAT with?  Not many.  I won't even go into how to make the car handle like a BMW M3 (yes, it can be done) but that is all possible, too.  There are more aftermarket goodies out there than you can imagine.

Plus, there are several awesome websites with thousands of owners out there waiting to help you with problems and suggestions.  The sites are located at http://www.grandprix.net/, http://www.grandprixstore.com/, and http://www.clubgp.com.  Check them out and you'll see that there are tons of people who love these cars and know how to modify them accordingly.<br><br>
