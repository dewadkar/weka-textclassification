            I just love my new Honda Civic EX.  I bought it three weeks ago because a friend of mine told me to check it out.  Everyone I speak to tells me that Civics are really good cars and last for a long time and after reading the info the Honda dealership gave me, I think I made the right decision.  The car gets great gas mileage and is fairly inexpensive.  It has a fairly roomy backseat as far as 2-dr compact cars go, and you can buy it without ABS which I like.  There is not very much road noise, but there is some air noise while driving on the freeways.  The engine is extremely quiet and had a lot of pick-me-up for such a little car.  It costs extra to get a spoiler and tinted windows, but I would recommend it because it looks really sporty.  It also comes with standard air, cruise, CD player, and sunroof if you go with the EX, which I also recommend.  If you by the HX, those things aren't standard, but you get a CVT transmission that helps the car to shift really smoothly that the EX doesn't have.  All in all, it's a great car for a great price and consumer reports say that it's their #1 choice!<br><br>
