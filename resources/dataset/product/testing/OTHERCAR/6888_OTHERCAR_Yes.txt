            I know, I know, most people wouldn't call a Toyota Corolla a tank. It's not big, it's not heavy, but it's solid. My one is a 1979 model I picked up nearly two years ago for $300. Since then, I've had more than 30,000 miles out of it, and spent nothing on it but gas and oil. The air conditioning even still works, a rare find in anything under $1000.

Actually, I did spend a few bucks on helper springs, as the back end tended to bottom out when landing from speed humps. (I <i>do not</i> slow down for them, as a matter of principle.) The only thing is, the only helper springs the local parts store had said &quot;Fits most cars&quot; on them, which means they're built to go under 2 1/2 ton Cadillacs. Needless to say, the ride is now a bit firm, and my back bumper is 6&quot; higher than it's supposed to be. It also tends to hop a bit when landing from a foot or so in the air. But it no longer bottoms out.

You may realize that I do not go easy on my cars. I am a demanding driver. I take it slow for the first few miles; I refuse to rev a clod engine, but once it's warm, I will thrash it for all it's worth. But I can't break this little 1.6L 4-banger.

I know most people are more interested in how fast, safe, comfy, or efficient the newer ones are, and I can't help you there. Wish I could. Until I can afford one, this little steed will do what I need it to.
