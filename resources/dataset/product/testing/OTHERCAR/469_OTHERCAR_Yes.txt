            I now own a 1999 Monte Carlo.  Torch Red.  It has to be the smoothest riding car I've ever been in. You see the commercials that when you are going over a rr track, your coffee doesnt spill?  That describes a Monte Carlo...

Comfortability is Number one.  I have taken several long 2-day trips in this car and never felt cramped, ached, it is very very comfortable and roomy also.  I havent had to have this car in the shop for any repairs...just the regular oil changes.  Very Dependable and I would recommend this type of car to someone who would enjoy luxury at a low price. <br><br>
