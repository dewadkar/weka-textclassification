            If you are in the market for a used car and are looking to spend about $5000 on one that will last you at least 6-7 years, test drive a pre-owned Saturn SL1.  They are available at both Saturn and Ford dealers, as well as sites like cars.com, but Saturn lovers who need to sell will surely be advertising for much better prices in your local classifieds.

I have driven an SL1 since March of 1993.  It has been through a number of harsh midwest winters, gone almost 80K, and has undergone only one repair in these 6 1/2 years (an alternator replacement, $250).

An automatic transmission, the car gets about 30 miles to the gallon in the city and 36 on the freeway, and $12 fills up the tank in a big city.  I have taken it in for regularly scheduled maintenance (every 3-4K) and, as a result, the car is not even halfway into its life.

I bought it because of the exceptional service record, outstanding customer service, great price, and MPG.  I chose it over the Pontiac Grand Am and the Honda Civic.

Just as a side note, the customer service really is as good as it is made out to be.  Every dealer I've visited for service or just to stop by has made every effort to cater to my needs - and that's important with such a big investment.<br><br>
