               Ah yes, the Honda Accord. This is one of those cars that when you ask someone what kind of car you should buy, they will usually mention this car. What is it about the Accord that makes it so good? I was wanted to find myself, so I went to the local dealer and took some test drives.
   The answer is balance. What? Yes, balance. But what does that mean you may wonder? Easy, no car in this class brings everything together into one package better than the Honda Accord.Ok, the Nissan Maxima comes real close, but it does not offer a four cylinder model to satisfy people on a budget. 

Steering/Handling: A+

   This is always one of the things that makes a Honda special compared to cars like the Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus. If you read the magazines, the numbers don't always tell the story. The Accord, like all Hondas I've driven, has a light and nimble feel to it plus a smooth and comfortable ride. Its like a good athlete yet. The steering is razor sharp and quick enough for most people. The brakes work well and provide ample feedback. Older Hondas were known for fussy brakes so just keep an eye on them!

Engine and transmission: A

  I was interested in the car enough to request to drive both the four and six cylinder. I figured I would only drive the automatics since most people buy those anyway. For some reason, the automatic in the four shifted a bit better than the one in the six, which shifted a little too soon for my tastes. Power on both was above average for its class. The four is lighter and it seemed to handle a bit better than the six which felt a little less nimble when the road gets twisty. Overall I like the four cylinder model a little bit better and the fact that you can get it with a proper five speed manual makes it even more appealing. I'd really like to see a manual transmission available on the V6 models.

Interior: A+
   Other car makers should spend a few hours behind the wheel of this car before they do start on the design of their own interiors. This environment would look proper in a $40,000 car but the Accord is half that much! The cup holder actually hold cups well! I also love the sunglass holder which could also make a great hiding spot for a cell phone. Tedious attention to detail is obvious everywhere you look. All of the controls are properly placed and they feel good. The large speedometer and tach are easy to read. The seats are very comfy and there is plenty of room for tall people like me to stretch, unlike a cramped Nissan Altima.

Exterior: B
   The Accord is a nice looking car but it really does not do anything to excite me. It looks like a Japanese car which is not a bad thing, but its a slightly generic looking car. It wont turn heads nor will it turn stomachs either. If anything, it does look more exciting than the Camry and anything looks better than the Ovoid '96-'99 Taurus.

Overall: A+
  There are few cars at this price that do so many things as well as this car. Its the perfect family car due to its good safety record and roomy interior, but it also manages to satisfy ME, a driving enthusiast! It really is a fun car to drive. That plus Honda quality and reliability you really can't go wrong with an Accord. I just love it!<br><br>
