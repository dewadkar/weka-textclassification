            I purchased this 1995 Nissan Pathfinder because had a 1987 Nissan pickup that served me well for 280,000 miles and I wanted an SUV that was comparable.  I love it.. Although the consumer guides had said it gets bad gas mileage, mine gets an average of 24 miles per gallon in combined city/highway driving. I have owned a Ford Explorer and a Jeep Wagoneer.  This is better.. The ride is quieter, it is easier to change the seating arrangement for carrying things. It is easy to switch to 4-wheel drive. I have had no problems with the 4-wheel drive as I did with the Jeep.   My dealer is great.  I can get things taken care of fast and convenient, not with the long waits to get into have it serviced that I have had at other dealers. This gets me where I want to go, in comfort whether it is in the city or in the snow and ice covered mountains.. If you want a reliable and comfortable hard-working vehicle that has minimal repair costs and lasts well, the Nissan Pathfinder is it!! Great stereo system, but uses antenna rather than window antenna. Easy to put back seats for a short rest on long trips.
